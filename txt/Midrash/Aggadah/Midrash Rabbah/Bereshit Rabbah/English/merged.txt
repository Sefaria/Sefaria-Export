Bereshit Rabbah



Chapter 1

Rabbi Hoshaya the Great began: “I<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The speaker is Wisdom (the Torah) personified.</i> was with Him as an <i>amon</i>, a delight day after day…” (Proverbs 8:30) – <i>amon</i> means a child’s caretaker, <i>amon</i> means covered, <i>amon</i> means hidden, and some say <i>amon </i>means greatness. <i>Amon </i>means a child’s caretaker, as it says: “As a caretaker [<i>omen</i>] carries a nursing child” (Numbers 11:12). <i>Amon </i>means covered, as it says: “Those covered [<i>ha’emunim</i>] in scarlet…” (Lamentations 4:5). <i>Amon </i> means hidden, as it says: “He was <i>omen<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded to mean that Mordekhai hid Esther from the emissaries of Aḥashverosh.</i></i> Hadassa” (Esther 2:7). <i>Amon </i>means great, as it says: “Are you better than No Amon [which sits in the rivers]?” (Nahum 3:8), which we translate in Targum as: Are you better than the great city of Alexandria,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">No (or No Amon) is the name of a city in Egypt. Targum identifies this city as Alexandria, and explains Amon to mean great.</i> which is located among the rivers? <br>Another matter, <i>amon </i>means artisan [<i>uman</i>]. The Torah is saying: ‘I was the tool of craft of the Holy One blessed be He.’ The way of the world is that when a flesh-and-blood king builds a palace he does not build it based on his own knowledge, but rather based on the knowledge of an artisan.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A professional builder.</i> And the artisan does not build it based on his own knowledge, but rather, he has [plans on] sheets and tablets by which to ascertain how he should build its rooms, how he should build its doors. So too, the Holy One blessed be He looked in the Torah and created the world. The Torah says: “<i>Bereshit</i> God created” (Genesis 1:1), and <i>reshit </i>is nothing other than the Torah, as it says: “The Lord made me at the beginning of [<i>reshit</i>] His way” (Proverbs 8:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Be-reshit</i> is interpreted as ‘by means of the Torah.’</i>
Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin began in the name of Rabbi Levi: “The power of His deeds<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The account of Creation.</i> He told to His people, to give them the inheritance of nations” (Psalms 111:6). What is the reason that the Holy One blessed be He revealed what was created on the first day and what was created on the second day? It is due to the idolaters, so they could not rebuke Israel and say to them: ‘You are a nation of robbers.’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">By your conquest of the land of Israel from its original inhabitants.</i> Israel responds to them and says to them: ‘And you, is it [your own land] not in your hands by robbery? Is it not so that: “Kaftorim, who emerged from Kaftor, destroyed them [the Avites], and settled in their place”? (Deuteronomy 2:23). The world and all its contents belong to the Holy One blessed be He. When He wished He gave it to you, and when He wished He took it from you and gave it to us.’ That is what is written: “[The power of His deeds He told to His people,] to give them the inheritance of nations…” – He told them [the history of] all the generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So that they should see clearly that peoples have often conquered other peoples.</i>
<b>“In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1).</b> <br>“In the beginning, God created” – Rabbi Tanḥuma began: “For You are great and perform wonders” (Psalms 86:10). Rabbi Tanḥum said: A wineskin, if it has a hole as small as the point of a needle, all its air will escape from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">When one inflates it to determine whether there are any holes.</i> Yet a human is made with numerous cavities and orifices, but his air does not escape from him. Who can do so? It is “You, alone, are God” (Psalms 86:10). <br>When were the angels created? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The angels [<i>malakhim</i>] were created on the second day. That is what is written: “He covers His upper chambers<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The heavens.</i> with water…”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is what God did on the second day (Genesis 1:6–7).</i> (Psalms 104:3), and it is written: “He makes the winds His messengers [<i>malakhav</i>]” (Psalms 104:4). <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The angels were created on the fifth day. That is what is written: “Let birds fly [<i>yeofef</i>] over the earth…” (Genesis 1:20), and it is written [of the angels]: “And with two<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The seraphim had six wings, using two of them for flight (Isaiah 6:2).</i> it would fly [<i>yeofef</i>]” (Isaiah 6:2). Rabbi Lulyana bar Tavrin said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Both according to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina and according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, everyone agrees that none were created on the first day, so people should not say: Mikhael was pulling at the south side of the heavens and Gabriel at its north side, while the Holy One blessed be He straightened it out in the middle. Rather, “I am the Lord, who made everything; who stretched out the heavens alone…by Myself [<i>me’iti</i>]” (Isaiah 44:24) – <i>it</i> [the last word] is written [as two],<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Although the word is pronounced (<i>keri</i>) <i>me’iti,</i> in the biblical text it is written (<i>ketiv</i>) as two words, <i>mi iti</i>.</i> “who is with Me [<i>mi iti</i>]?” Who was partner with Me in the creation of the world? <br>Another matter, “for You are great and perform wonders” (Psalms 86:10) – the way of the world is that a flesh-and-blood king, when he is receives praise in the province,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For its magnificent buildings or for its proficient administration.</i> the prominent leaders of the province receive praise along with him, as they bear the burden [of governing] with him. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so; rather, He alone created the world, He alone is lauded in the world, He alone is glorified in the world. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: “For You are great and perform wonders” – why? It is because “You, alone, are God” – You alone created the world.
“In the beginning, God created” – six items preceded the creation of the world; some of them were [actually] created, and some of them God contemplated creating, [though He did not actually do so]. The Torah and the Throne of Glory were created. Torah, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “The Lord made me<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The speaker is Wisdom (the Torah) personified.</i> at the beginning of His way” (Proverbs 8:22). The Throne of Glory, from where is it derived? “Your throne stands firm from earliest time, [You are from eternity]” (Psalms 93:2). The patriarchs, Israel, the Temple, and the name of the messianic king – God contemplated creating them [before the world, but did not]. The patriarchs, from where is it derived? “Like grapes in the wilderness [I found Israel, like a first fruit on the fig tree, at its beginning [<i>bereshitah</i>] I saw your fathers]” (Hosea 9:10). Israel, from where is it derived? “Remember Your congregation, that You acquired from old times” (Psalms 74:2). The Temple, from where is it derived? “Throne of glory, exalted from the beginning, [is the place of our Temple]” (Jeremiah 17:12). The name of the messianic king, from where is it derived? “May his name endure forever. His name is praised before the sun”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash expounds “before” to mean prior to.</i> (Psalms 72:17). Rabbi Ahava ben Rabbi Ze’eira said: Repentance as well, as it is stated: “Before the birth of mountains” (Psalms 90:2), and at that same time, “You bring man down until he is crushed, [and then You say: Return, sons of man]” (Psalms 90:3). <br>But I do not know which of them<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The two things that were actually created before the world.</i> was first – did the Torah precede the Throne of Glory, or did the Throne of Glory precede the Torah? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The Torah preceded the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “The Lord made me at the beginning of His way, [before His undertakings of old times]” (Proverbs 8:22) – before that in whose regard it is written: “Your throne stands firm from earliest time” (Psalms 93:2). <br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak: The contemplation about [creating] Israel preceded all other things. This is analogous to a king who married a noblewoman, but did not have a son from her. Once the king was found passing in the marketplace. He said: ‘Take this ink and inkwell for my son.’ Everyone was saying: ‘He has no son and yet he says: Take this ink and inkwell for my son?’ Then they said: ‘The king is a great astrologer, had it not been that he is destined to beget a son from her, he would not have said: Take this ink and inkwell for my son.’ So, too, had it not been that the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that after twenty-six generations Israel was destined to receive the Torah, He would not have written in the Torah: “Command the children of Israel”; “speak to the children of Israel.” <br>Rabbi Banai said: The world and its contents were created only due to the merit of the Torah, as it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom [<i>beḥochma</i>]”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beḥochma</i> could also be translated “for the sake of wisdom” – wisdom, throughout Proverbs, refers to the Torah. Similarly, the Midrash is interpreting <i>Bereshit</i> as “for the sake of <i>Reshit</i>” – God created the heavens and the earth for the sake of that which is called <i>Reshit</i>.</i> (Proverbs 3:19). Rabbi Berekhya said: It was due to the merit of Moses, as it is stated: “He saw the first [<i>reshit</i>] for himself, [as there the portion of the lawgiver is hidden]” (Deuteronomy 33:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Moses, the lawgiver, is called <i>Reshit</i>, the first one.</i> <br>Rav Huna said in the name of Rav Matana: The world was created for the sake of three things: For the sake of <i>ḥalla</i>, for the sake of tithes, and for the sake of first fruits. What is the source? “In the beginning, [<i>bereshit</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Or, for the sake of <i>reshit</i>.</i> God created,” and <i>reshit </i>is nothing other than <i>ḥalla</i>, as it is stated: “The first of [<i>reshit</i>] your kneading basket” (Numbers 15:20). <i>Reshit </i>is nothing other than tithes, as it says: “The first [<i>reshit</i>] of your grain” (Deuteronomy 18:4). And <i>reshit </i>is nothing other than first fruits, as it is stated: “The choicest of [<i>reshit</i>] the first fruits of your land…” (Exodus 23:19).
Rav Huna began in the name of bar Kapara: “May they be silenced [<i>te’alamna</i>], those lying lips [that speak harsh words against the righteous one with arrogance and contempt]” (Psalms 31:19) – may they be bound up, may they become mute, may they be silenced.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>te’alamna</i> can have all these three meanings, as the Midrash goes on to show.</i> May they become mute – as it says: “Who gives a mouth to a person, or who renders one mute [<i>ilem</i>] or deaf, or sighted or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?” (Exodus 4:11). And [may they be bound up,] as it says: “Behold, we were binding [<i>me’alemim</i>] sheaves in the field and behold, my sheaf arose” (Genesis 37:7). May they be silenced – that is its plain sense.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">That is the literal translation of <i>te’alamna</i>.</i> “That speak…against the Righteous One” (Psalms 31:19) – [this refers to] Him of eternal life.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The “righteous one” refers to God.</i> “Harsh words [<i>atak</i>]” (Psalms 31:19) – matters that He concealed [<i>shehe’etik</i>] from His creations.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">They speak out loud and expound on the secrets of Creation.</i> “With arrogance” (Psalms 31:19) – this is an expression of bewilderment:<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Can it be that someone would do such a thing out of arrogance?</i> [Do they do this] in order to boast arrogantly: I am expounding the act of Creation? “And contempt” (Psalms 31:19) – this [too] is an expression of bewilderment: Is it in order to show contempt for My honor? As Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Anyone who attains honor through the degradation of another person has no portion in the World to Come; how much more so is this so regarding the honor of the Omnipresent. What is written following this? “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20) – for those who fear You, but not for those who demean the [awesome] fear of You. They will not be included in: “How great is the goodness.” <br>The way of the world is that when a flesh-and-blood king builds his palace in [a location that had been] a place of sewers, a place of refuse, and a malodorous place, anyone who comes and says: ‘This palace was built in a place of sewers, a place of refuse, and a malodorous place,’ is this not an insult? So, too, anyone who comes and says: ‘This world was created from emptiness and disorder,’ is this not an insult? This is a rhetorical question. Rav Huna said in the name of bar Kapara: Were the matter not written explicitly it would not have been possible to say it: “In the beginning, God created” (Genesis 1:1) – from what? “The earth was emptiness and disorder” (Genesis 1:2).
Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon began: “He reveals the deep and the hidden [<i>umsatrata</i>]” (Daniel 2:22). “He reveals the deep” – this is Gehenna, as it is stated: “He does not know that the ghosts are there; [her guests are in the depths of the netherworld]” (Proverbs 9:18). And it says: “He deepened [<i>he’emik</i>] and widened” (Isaiah 30:33). “And the hidden [<i>umsatrata</i>]” – this is the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “For protection and refuge [<i>ulmistor</i>]” (Isaiah 4:6). And it says: “Conceal them [<i>tastirem</i>] in the hideaway of Your presence” (Psalms 31:21). <br>Another matter, “He reveals the deep and the hidden [<i>umsatrata</i>]” – these are the actions of the wicked, as it is stated: “Those who go deep from the Lord” (Isaiah 29:15). <i>Umsatrata</i> – these are the actions of the wicked, as it is stated: “To conceal [<i>listor</i>] counsel” (Isaiah 29:15). “He knows what is in the darkness” (Daniel 2:22) – these are the actions of the wicked, as it is stated: “Their actions are in the darkness” (Isaiah 29:15). “And the light rests with Him” (Daniel 2:22) – these are the actions of the righteous, as it is written: “But the path of the righteous is like a dawning light” (Proverbs 4:18), and it says: “Light is sown for the righteous…” (Psalms 97:11). Rabbi Abba Sarongaya said: “And the light rests with Him” – this is the messianic king, as it is stated: “Arise, shine, [for your light has come and the glory of the Lord has shone upon you]” (Isaiah 60:1), etc. in <i>Pesikta</i>. <sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash refers us to <i>Pesikta Rabati parashat Kumi ori, </i>where the idea of light representing the Messiah is expounded further. (According to some, the word בפסיקתא is a scribal error and should be deleted.)</i> <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: From the beginning of the creation of the world, “He reveals the deep and the hidden” (Daniel 2:22). [The verse states:] “In the beginning God created [the heavens]” (Genesis 1:1) – but it did not elaborate.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">As to how they were created.</i> And where did it elaborate? It was elsewhere: “Who spread the heavens like a curtain” (Isaiah 40:22). [It states further:] “And the earth” (Genesis 1:1) – but it did not elaborate. And where did it elaborate? It was elsewhere: “For He says to the snow: Become the earth” (Job 37:6); “when the dust consolidated into a mass…” (Job 38:38). [It states:] “God said: Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3) – but it did not elaborate. Where did it elaborate? “Enveloping with light as if with a cloak” (Psalms 104:2).
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “The beginning of Your word is truth…” (Psalms 119:160) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Right from the beginning of the creation of the world [it can be seen that] “the beginning of Your word is truth” – “in the beginning, God created.” “But My Lord God is truth” (Jeremiah 10:10),<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This verse shows that God is the epitome of truth, and it is fitting that He should establish this truth right at the beginning of the Torah. This truth is the unity of God, as the Midrash goes on to explain.</i> “All Your righteous laws are eternal” (Psalms 119:160) – as each and every edict that You decree upon Your creations, they accept the judgment upon themselves and receive it faithfully, and no person can come and say that two authorities created the world:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Other versions add: Or that two authorities gave the Torah.</i> “God [<i>Elohim</i>] spoke [<i>vaydaberu</i>]” is not written here [in plural], but rather [in singular], “God spoke [<i>vaydaber</i>];”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Although the word <i>Elohim</i> is grammatically a plural form, the Torah constantly uses singular verbs with it, proving that God is indeed one. </i> “God [<i>Elohim</i>] said [<i>vayomeru</i>]” is not written here [in plural], but rather [in singular], “God said [<i>vayomer</i>]”; “In the beginning God created [<i>bare’u</i>]” is not written here [in plural], but rather [in singular], “God created [<i>bara</i>].”
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Rabbi Levi: A builder requires six items: Water, dirt, wood, stones, reeds, and iron. If you say that he is wealthy and does not need reeds [to build with], he still needs to use them as a measuring rod, as it is stated: “A linen thread and a measuring rod” (Ezekiel 40:3). So, too, the Torah employed these six expressions of precedence: “Of old [<i>kedem</i>]…from earliest time [<i>me’az</i>], from ancient times [<i>meolam</i>]…from the beginning [<i>merosh</i>], from before [<i>mikadmei</i>]…” (Proverbs 8:22–23) – which counts as two,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>mikadmei</i> is a plural form.</i> in the section of “the Lord made me” (Proverbs 8:22).
A certain philosopher once asked Rabban Gamliel, saying to him: ‘Your God is a great artist, however he found many excellent raw materials that helped him: Emptiness, disorder, darkness, wind, water, and depths.’ He said to him: ‘May the spirit of that man depart from him; regarding all of them, creation is written.’<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">God did not “find” these materials; He created them Himself.</i> Emptiness and disorder, as it is stated: “Who makes peace and creates evil” (Isaiah 45:7). Darkness, “who forms light [and creates darkness]” (Isaiah 45:7); water, “Praise Him, heavens on heavens, and the water [above the heavens]” (Psalms 148:4). Why? “For He commanded and they were created” (Psalms 148:5). Wind, “For behold, He forms mountains and creates wind” (Amos 4:13); depths, “when there were no depths, I generated” (Proverbs 8:24).
Rabbi Yona said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Why was the world created with the letter <i>beit</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">It is the first letter of “<i>bereshit</i> – in the beginning.”</i> It is because just as the <i>beit </i>is closed on all [three of] its sides but open in its front, so, you do not have permission to ask: What is below, what is above, what was before, and what is after,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ḥagiga </i>2:1. One should not ponder what is above the firmament and what is below the earth, what was before Creation, and what will be after the end of the world.</i> but only from the day when the world created and onward. Bar Kapara said: “For ask now of the early days that were before you, from the day [that God created man upon the earth]” (Deuteronomy 4:32) – from the day they were created, you may inquire, but you may not inquire what was before that. “From one end of the heavens to the other end” (Deuteronomy 4:32), you may inquire and investigate, but what is beyond that you may not investigate. Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi expounded regarding the act of Creation together with bar Kapara: Why was the world created with the letter <i>beit</i>? It is to inform you that there are two worlds,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The numerical value of <i>beit</i> is two.</i> this world and the World to Come. <br>Another matter, why with a <i>beit</i>? Because it alludes to an expression of blessing [<i>berakha</i>]. And why not with an <i>alef</i>? Because it alludes to an expression of curse [<i>arira</i>]. Another matter, why not with an <i>alef</i>? It is to avoid giving recourse to the heretics to say: How can the world endure, as it was created with an expression of curse? Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Behold, I will create it with an expression of blessing, and there is hope that perhaps it will endure.’ <br>Another matter, why with a <i>beit</i>? It is because just as the <i>beit </i>has two protrusions, one above it and one below and behind it, if one says to the <i>beit</i>: ‘Who created you?’ It points with its upper protrusion, saying: ‘That One who is above created me.’ ‘And what is His name?’ It points with its rear protrusion and says: ‘The Lord [<i>Adonai</i>] is His name.’<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">It points to the letter that is behind it, the <i>alef</i>, which is the first letter of <i>Adonai</i>, one of God’s names.</i> <br>Rabbi Elazar bar Ḥanina said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: For twenty-six generations<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This is the number of generations that passed from Creation to the giving of the Torah.</i> the <i>alef </i>complained before the throne of the Holy One blessed be He. It said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, I am the first of the letters, but You did not create Your world with me.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘The world and all its contents were created only for the sake of the Torah, as it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom…”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See earlier, section 4.</i> (Proverbs 3:19). Tomorrow, I will be coming to give the Torah at Sinai, and I will open it at its beginning only with you, as it is stated: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] am the Lord your God”’ (Exodus 20:2). Rabbi Hoshaya says: Why is it called <i>alef</i>? It is because He consented concerning a thousand, as it is stated: “The word that He commanded for one thousand [<i>elef</i>] generations” (Psalms 105:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah was originally supposed to be given to the thousandth [<i>elef</i>] generation (<i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 28:4). The first letter of that Torah was therefore given the name <i>alef</i>.</i>
Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: [The alternative forms of the letters] <i>Mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>kaf</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">These letters have different forms depending on whether they appear in the beginning or middle of a word, or at its end.</i> the prophets said them, though it was a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses at Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The existence of these alternative forms was transmitted to Moses, forgotten, and the prophets restored them.</i> Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: What the prophets instituted.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The letters are not listed in the order they appear in the alphabet, and the list can be read as <i>min tzofakh</i> – from your prophets.</i> It once happened that there was a stormy day and the Sages could not gather at the house of assembly,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>bet midrash</i>, where the Torah was expounded.</i> but there were some children there. They said: ‘Let us make our own house of assembly.’ They said: ‘What is the reason that it is written <i>mem mem</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Why are there two forms with which to write <i>mem</i>, and so on.</i> <i>nun</i> <i>nun</i>, <i>tzadi tzadi</i>, <i>peh peh</i>, <i>kaf kaf</i> ? It is for this reason: [To allude to the fact that the Torah was transmitted] from<i> </i>utterance [<i>ma’amar</i>] to utterance, from a faithful one [<i>ne’eman</i>] to a faithful one, from a righteous one [<i>tzadik</i>] to a righteous one, from mouth [<i>peh</i>] to mouth, from hand [<i>kaf</i>] to hand.<i> </i>From utterance to utterance – from the utterance of the Holy One blessed be He to the utterance of Moses; from a faithful one to a faithful one – from the Holy One blessed be He, who is called ‘God, faithful King’ – to Moses who is called faithful, as it is written: “In all My house he is faithful” (Numbers 12:7); from a righteous one to a righteous one – from the Holy One blessed be He, who is called righteous, as it is written: “Righteous is the Lord in all His ways” (Psalms 145:17), to Moses, who was called righteous<i>, </i>as it is written: “He performed the righteousness of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 33:21); from mouth to mouth – from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He, to the mouth of Moses; from hand to hand<i> </i>– from the hand of the Holy One blessed be He, to the hand of Moses.’ They [the Sages] took note of them [the children], and [ultimately] great sages in Israel emerged from among them. Some say they were Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Akiva. And they applied to them the verse: “Even a boy is recognized through his deeds, if his action is pure or upright” (Proverbs 20:11). <In <i>anokhi </i>of Rabbi Meir…><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">These words are a scribal error and should be deleted (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i>
Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Akilas: To this One it is fitting to call God. The ordinary way of the world is that a flesh-and-blood king is praised in his province though he has not yet built any public baths in it and has not yet built private baths in it.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">That is, without yet having provided anything for his subjects.</i> First he proclaims his name and then presents his works. The Unique One of the world, however, first acted and then He was praised. Shimon ben Azai says: “Your humility has made me great” (II Samuel 22:36) – a flesh-and-blood [king] mentions his name first and then his title of praise: So-and-so Augustoli,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">A title of great rank.</i> So-and-so <i>Pro titulo</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, whatever the title may be.</i> But the Holy One blessed be He is not so; instead, after creating the needs of his world, only then does He mention His name: “In the beginning…created [<i>bereshit bara</i>]” and then “God [<i>Elohim</i>].”
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: From where is it derived that a person should not say [when consecrating an offering]: ‘To the Lord, a burnt offering,’ ‘To the Lord, a meal offering,’ ‘To the Lord, a peace offering,’ but rather: ‘A burnt offering to the Lord,’ ‘A meal offering to the Lord,’ ‘A peace offering to the Lord’?<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">As a precaution, one should not say “to the Lord” before stating the offering in question, to avoid a situation where one might say “to the Lord” and fail to complete the statement.</i> As the verse states: “An offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 1:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This is another explanation as to why the first verse of the Torah mentions God’s name only as the third word.</i> A lesson can be derived from this by <i>a fortiori</i>: If, even of one who is about to consecrate something, the Torah says: Let the name of Heaven not be desecrated through the sacrifice; then those who curse, blaspheme, and engage in idol worship,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Engaging in actual desecration of God’s name.</i> all the more so that they will be eradicated from the world. <br>The Rabbis say: When a flesh-and-blood person builds a building, if the building process goes well, he makes it broad on top, but if not, he must make it broader on the bottom and narrower at the top.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">If he sees that the foundations are not so sturdy, or the building materials are inferior, he must make the building narrower as it rises, for structural integrity.</i> But the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather “[God created] the heavens”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">With the definite article, alluding to an item that is already known.</i> – those heavens that He had previously planned; “and the earth” – that earth that he had previously planned. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: Even those things, about which it is written: “For, behold, I am creating new heavens [and a new earth]” (Isaiah 65:17), [they] were already created since the six days of Creation. That is what is written: “For just as the new heavens and the new earth” (Isaiah 66:22); “[new heavens] and a new earth” is not written here, but rather, “the new [heavens and the new earth].”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The addition of the definite article indicates that it refers to earth and heavens that are previously known.</i>
Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Akiva, saying to him: ‘Because you studied under Naḥum of Gam Zo for twenty-two years, [who taught:] The words <i>akh</i> and <i>rak</i> are restrictive expressions, <i>et </i>and <i>gam </i>are inclusive expressions, [I ask you:] What is the meaning of the <i>et </i>that is written here [twice]?’<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Et hashamayin ve’et haaretz</i>.</i> He said to him: ‘Had it been stated: “In the beginning God created heavens and earth [<i>bereshit bara elohim shamayim vaaretz</i>]” – we might have said that the heavens and the earth are deities.’<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">It could have been interpreted: ‘God, who is heavens and earth, created.’ The word <i>et</i>, however, indicates that what follows is the direct object of the verb.</i> <br>He [Rabbi Yishmael] said to him: “For it is not an empty matter for you [<i>mikem</i>]” (Deuteronomy 32:47) – if it is empty, it is because of you [<i>mikem</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">If you find something in the Torah that appears devoid of significance, it is because of your own ignorance.</i> because you do not know how to expound, because you do not exert yourself in its regard. “As it [the Torah] is your life” (Deuteronomy 32:47) – when is it your life? It is when you exert yourself in its regard. Rather [the explanation is]: “<i>et hashamayim</i>”<i> </i>– to include the sun, the moon, and the constellations; “<i>ve’et haaretz</i>” – to include trees, vegetation, and the Garden of Eden. <br>Rabbi Tanḥuma said in the name of Rav Huna: “Betzalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, did everything that the Moses commanded him” is not stated, but rather, “everything that the Lord commanded Moses” (Exodus 38:22). Even matters that he [Betzalel] did not hear from his teacher, his perception corresponded to what was stated to Moses at Sinai. Rabbi Ḥonya said in the name of Rabbi: “The Torah of truth was in his mouth” (Malachi 2:6) – these are matters that he heard directly from his teacher.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The following line should be added here (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>): “and falsehood was not found on his lips” (Malachi 2:6) – these are matters that he did not hear from his teacher.</i> The Rabbis say: “For the Lord will be your hope [<i>bekislekha</i>]” (Proverbs 3:26) – even matters that you are a fool [<i>kesil</i>] in their regard, “He will protect your foot from being ensnared” (Proverbs 3:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">If you make a concerted effort to understand, God will assist you, even regarding matters that you do not know about, so that you will not be caught up in any misstep. </i> Rabbi Dosai said: From promulgating [mistaken] teachings. Rabbi Abahu said: From transgressing. Rabbi Levi said: From malevolent spirits. Rabbi Avdimus said: If you gave charity from your purse [<i>kis-lekha</i>], the Holy One blessed be He will protect you from being charged unjust security taxes, fines, head taxes, and property taxes.
Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, Beit Shammai say: The heavens were created first and the earth was created thereafter. Beit Hillel says: The earth was created first and the heavens thereafter.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">One verse puts the order as “God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1), but another has the opposite: “On the day that the Lord God made earth and the heavens” (Genesis 2:4). Which is the true chronological order?</i> These cite a reason for their position and those cite a reason for their position. According to the opinion of Beit Shammai, who say that the heavens were created first and the earth thereafter, it is analogous to a king who had a throne made, and once that was made he had its footstool made. So, the Holy One blessed be He said: “The heavens are My throne and the earth is My footstool…” (Isaiah 66:1). According to the opinion of Beit Hillel, who say that the earth was created first and the heavens thereafter, it is analogous to a king who built a palace; first he built the lower sections and then he built the upper sections, so, “on the day that the Lord God made earth and the heavens” (Genesis 2:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The earth first, then the heavens.</i> Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: This verse, too, supports Beit Hillel: “You laid the foundations of earth in times past” (Psalms 102:26), and then, “the heavens are the work of Your hands” (Psalms 102:26). Rabbi Ḥanin said: From the same place where Scripture supports Beit Shammai,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">"God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1).</i> from there, Beit Hillel refute them: “The earth was” (Genesis 1:2) – it already was. <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of the Sages: In terms of Creation, the heavens were first, but in terms of completion, the earth was first. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I will say the source; in terms of Creation, the heavens were first, as it is stated: “In the beginning, God created [the heavens].” In terms of completion, the earth was first, as it is stated: “On the day that the Lord God made earth and the heavens.” <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: I am surprised how it is that the fathers of the world, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, disagreed regarding the creation of the heavens and the earth. It is, rather, as I say, that both of them were created [at the same time,] like a stewpot and its lid, as it is stated: “[My hand also laid the foundation of the earth and My right hand measured the heavens]; I appointed them; they arise together” (Isaiah 48:13). <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon said: If it is in accordance with the opinion of my father, why is it that at times the earth is mentioned before the heavens and at times the heavens are mentioned before the earth? Rather, it teaches that both of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place Abraham is mentioned before Isaac and Jacob, but in one place it says: “I will remember My covenant with Jacob, [and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham]” (Leviticus 26:42). This teaches that the three of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place Moses is mentioned before Aaron, but in one place it says: “It is Aaron and Moses” (Exodus 6:26). This teaches that both of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place Joshua is mentioned before Caleb, but in one place it says: “Except for Caleb son of Yefuneh the Kenizite and Joshua son of Nun” (Numbers 14:30, Numbers 32:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">The citation in the Midrash is actually an amalgam of these two verses.</i> This teaches that both of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place turtledoves are mentioned before young pigeons, but in one place it says: “And a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering” (Leviticus 12:6). This tells you that both of them are equal in importance to one another.  <br>In every place, honor of the father is mentioned before the mother, but in one place it says: “Each of you shall fear his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3). This tells you that both of them are equal in importance to one another. However, the Sages said: The father takes precedence over the mother, because both he [a son] and his mother are obligated to honor his father. <br>In every place the creation of the heavens is mentioned before the earth, but in one place it says: “On the day that the Lord God made earth and the heavens.” This tells you that both of them are equal in importance to one another.

Chapter 2

<b>“The earth was emptiness and disorder, and darkness was upon the face of the depths, and the spirit of God hovered over the surface of the water” (Genesis 1:2).</b>  <br>“The earth was emptiness and disorder [<i>tohu vavohu</i>]” – Rabbi Berekhya began: “Even a boy is recognized through his deeds” (Proverbs 20:11) – Rabbi Berekhya said: While the plant was still immature, it produced thorns.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is a saying. Even before the plant produces flowers or seeds, it begins to produce small thorns, foreshadowing the deleterious nature of the plant in the future. </i> This is what the prophet would one day prophesy in its regard: “I have seen the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder” (Jeremiah 4:23).
Rabbi Abahu and Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon, Rabbi Abahu said: This is analogous to a king who purchased two slaves for himself, both of them with one bill of sale and with one sum. He decreed for one of them that he should be supported from the royal treasury, and for the other that he would have to toil to eat. That one sat, bewildered and astonished [<i>toheh uvoheh</i>]. He said: ‘Both of us were purchased with one bill of sale and one sum, yet this one is supported from the royal treasury, and I, if I do not toil, I do not eat?’ So, too, the earth sat bewildered and astonished. It said: ‘The celestial beings and the terrestrial beings were created simultaneously. The celestial beings are sustained from the radiance of the Divine Presence; as for the terrestrial beings, if they do not toil they do not eat.’  <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: It is analogous to a king who purchased two maidservants, both of them with one bill of sale and with one sum. He decreed for one of them that she should not depart from the palace, and for the other he decreed banishment. That maidservant sat bewildered and astonished [<i>toha uvoha</i>]. She said: ‘Both of us were purchased with one bill of sale and one sum, and this one does not go out and depart from the palace, but for me he decrees banishment?’ So, too, the earth sat bewildered and astonished [<i>toha uvoha</i>]. It said: ‘The celestial beings and the terrestrial beings were created simultaneously. The celestial beings live forever and the terrestrial beings die.’ That is why “the earth was emptiness and disorder [<i>tohu vavohu</i>].” <br>Rabbi Tanḥuma said: It is analogous to the son of a king, who was sleeping in his cradle, and his wet nurse was bewildered and astonished [<i>toha uvoha</i>], as she knew that she would ultimately receive her punishment on his account.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">When the child misbehaves, the nurse is blamed. Even before the child awoke this thought troubled her.</i> So, the earth foresaw that it was destined to receive its punishment on account of man, as it is stated: “Cursed is the ground on your account” (Genesis 3:17). That is why “the earth was emptiness and disorder [<i>tohu vavohu</i>].”
Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon interpreted the verses regarding the generations. “The earth was emptiness and disorder” – this is Adam the first man, who became oblivion and nothingness. “And disorder” – this is Cain, who sought to restore the world to emptiness and disorder. “And darkness” – this is the generation of Enosh,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">They profaned God’s name (Genesis 4:26; <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 23:7). </i> based on the verse: “Their actions are in the dark and they say: Who sees us and who knows of us?” (Isaiah 29:15). “Upon the face of the depths” – this is the generation of the Flood, as it is stated: “On that day all the wellsprings of the great depths were breached” (Genesis 7:11). “And the spirit [<i>ruaḥ</i>] of God was hovering over the surface of the water” – based on the verse: “God passed a wind [<i>ruaḥ</i>] over the earth” (Genesis 8:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruaḥ, too</i> is an allusion to the Flood.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Until when will the world conduct itself in darkness?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the darkness of idol worship.</i> Let some light come.’ “God said: Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3) – this is Abraham.

Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish interpreted the verses regarding the [four] kingdoms.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The kingdoms that subjugated Israel, as described in Daniel chapters 2 and 7, and identified by the Rabbis as Babylonia, Media, Greece and Edom (Rome was seen as the descending from Edom).</i> “The earth was emptiness” – this is the Babylonian kingdom, as it is stated: “I have seen the land, and behold, it was emptiness and disorder” (Jeremiah 4:23). “And disorder [<i>vavohu</i>]” – this is the Median kingdom, [as it is stated:] “They hastened [<i>vayavhilu</i>] to bring Haman” (Esther 6:14). “And darkness”– this is the Greek kingdom, which darkened Israel’s eyes with their edicts, as they used to say to them: ‘Write on the horn of a bull that you have no portion in the God of Israel.’ “Upon the face of the depths” – this is the evil kingdom [Edom], which cannot be calculated,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Its great size and power are beyond calculation.</i> like the depths; just as the depths cannot be calculated, so is it with [the wickedness of] the wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The text was altered due to censorship.

He said to him: ‘Ben Zoma, where were your thoughts?’ He said to him: ‘I have been contemplating.’ He said to him: ‘As the heavens and the earth are my witnesses, I shall not move from here until you inform me where your thoughts were.’ He said to him: ‘I was looking at the act of Creation, and [I saw that] between the upper waters and the lower waters there were only two or three fingerbreadths. “The spirit of the Lord was blowing” is not written, but rather, “was hovering” – like a bird that flaps its wings,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As it hovers over its nest.</i> they touch [the nest] but do not quite touch.’ Rabbi Yehoshua turned and said to his disciples: Ben Zoma is gone.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Having experienced such supernal revelations, he is no longer of this world. </i> Not even a few days passed with ben Zoma still in the world.
Rabbi Abahu and Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great, Rabbi Abahu said: Right from the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One blessed be He foresaw the actions of the righteous and the actions of the wicked. That is what is written: “For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish” (Psalms 1:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 8:4.</i> “The earth was emptiness and disorder” – these are the actions of the wicked. “God said: Let there be light” – these are the actions of the righteous. But I do not know which He desires, whether it is the actions of these, or the actions of those. When it is written: “God saw the light, that it was good” (Genesis 1:4) – this shows that He desires the actions of the righteous, and does not desire the actions of the wicked. <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: Right from the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One blessed be He foresaw the Temple built, destroyed, and rebuilt. “In the beginning God created [the heavens and the earth]” – that indicates [the Temple] being built, as it says: “To plant the heavens and to lay the foundation of the earth and to say to Zion: You are My people” (Isaiah 51:16). “The earth was emptiness and disorder” – that indicates [the Temple] destroyed, just as it says: “I have seen the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder” (Jeremiah 4:23). “God said: Let there be light” – that indicates [the Temple] being built and perfected in the future, as it says: “Arise, shine, for your light has come” (Isaiah 60:1), and it is written: “For, behold, the darkness will cover the earth, and nations, a fog; but upon you the Lord will shine and His glory will be seen upon you” (Isaiah 60:2).

Chapter 3

<b>“God said: Let there be light, and there was light” (Genesis 1:3).</b> <br>“God said: Let there be light” – Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “Your opening words enlighten; they bring understanding [to the simple]” (Psalms 119:130). Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: The light was created first. This is analogous to a king who sought to build a palace, but that location was dark. What did he do? He kindled lamps and lanterns to ascertain how he would lay the foundation. So, too, the light was created first. Rabbi Neḥemya said: The world was created first. This is analogous to a king who built a palace and adorned it with lamps and lanterns. Up to this point, Rabbi Yudan expounded.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yudan expounded the verse: “Your opening words enlighten” as support for the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda that the light was created first.</i> Rabbi Pinḥas, Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon, and Rabbi Ḥanon came and began in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak: “Your opening words enlighten; they bring understanding to the simple” – the opening of Your mouth for us was light: “God said: Let there be light…”
Rabbi Berekhya began in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: “By the word of the Lord the heavens were made” (Psalms 33:6). Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: It was not with toil and not with exertion that the Holy One blessed be He created His world, but rather, “by the word of God,” and the heavens were already made. Here, too, “and there was [<i>vehaya</i>] light”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Indicating that the light came into existence gradually.</i> is not written here, but rather, “<i>vayhi </i>light” – it immediately came about.
Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai began: “There is joy for a man in the pronouncement of his mouth, and how good is a word at its time” (Proverbs 15:23). “Joy for a man [<i>ish</i>]” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is a warrior [<i>ish milḥama</i>]; the Lord is His name” (Exodus 15:3). “In the pronouncement of his mouth” – “the Lord said: Let there be light.” “And how good is a word at its time” – “God saw the light, that it was good” (Genesis 1:4).
Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, saying to him: ‘Since I have about you that you are a master of <i>aggada</i>, [I ask you:] from what was the light created?’ He said to him: ‘It [the verse] teaches that the Holy One blessed be He wrapped himself in it like a garment, and the aura of its radiance shone from the end of the world to its end.’ He said it to him in a whisper.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is because one does not expound regarding the mysteries of Creation in public.</i> He said to him: ‘It is an explicit verse: “Wrapped in light as if with a garment” (Psalms 104:2), and you say it to me in a whisper?

That is what is written: “And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the direction of the east…[and the earth shone with His glory]” (Ezekiel 43:2). And his glory is nothing other than the Temple, just as it says: “Throne of glory, exalted from the first, the place of our Temple…” (Jeremiah 17:12).
Rabbi Simon said: Light is mentioned five times here, corresponding to the five books of the Torah. “God said: Let there be light” – corresponding to the book of Genesis, in which the Holy One blessed be He engaged in creating His world. “And there was light” – corresponding to the book of Exodus in which Israel emerged from darkness to light. “God saw the light, that it was good” (Genesis 1:4) – corresponding to the book of Leviticus, which is full of multiple <i>halakhot</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the two positive expressions: “light” and “good.”</i> “God distinguished between the light and the darkness” (Genesis 1:4) – corresponding to the book of Numbers, which distinguishes between those who departed from Egypt and those who entered the land. “God called the light, Day” (Genesis 1:5) – corresponding to the book of Deuteronomy, which is full of multiple <i>halakhot</i>. The students raised an objection to Rabbi Simon: ‘But is the book of Leviticus not full of <i>halakhot </i>[just like Deuteronomy]?’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding Leviticus, the double expression indicated the multiplicity of halakhot.

“God called the light, Day” – are “light” and “day” not the same thing? This is bewildering. It is taught: The light that was created during the six days of Creation cannot illuminate by day, because it would make the orb of the sun seem dim [by comparison], nor can it [illuminate] at night, as it was created to illuminate only during the day. Where is it, then?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since it does not illuminate the world at any time.</i> It was stored away, and is designated for the righteous for the future, as it is stated: “The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of the seven days” (Isaiah 30:26). <br>This is bewildering:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The verse just cited, which refers to the shining of the great light of Creation for seven days. </i> “Seven [days]”?

It is, rather, like a person who says: This and that I am preparing for the seven days of the wedding feast.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">He says this even if his preparations are for only one or two of the seven days.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: These are the seven days of mourning for the righteous Methuselah, during which the Holy One blessed be He conferred extra light upon them. <br><b>“God saw the light, that it was good, and God distinguished between the light and the darkness” (Genesis 1:4).</b> <br>“God saw the light, that it was good” – Rabbi Ze’eira son of Rabbi Abahu preached in Caesarea: From where is it derived that someone does not recite a blessing on the candle [at <i>havdala</i> on Saturday night] until he avails himself of its light? It is from here: “[God] saw…and [God] distinguished [<i>vayavdel</i>].” <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: He set it aside<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayavdel</i> (“He distinguished”) can also mean He set aside.</i> for Himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As it is said (Daniel 2:22): “Light dwells with Him.”</i> The Rabbis say: He set it aside for the righteous in the World to Come.

It was evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5).</b> <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: This is what two eminent men of the world, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, expounded: “[God] distinguished” – this refers to distinguishing in the literal sense.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the previous explanations.</i> This is analogous to a king who had two commanders, one to be in charge by day and one to be in charge by night. They were arguing with one another. This one said: ‘I will be in charge by day,’ and that one said: ‘I will be in charge by day.’ The king summoned the first one and said to him: ‘So-and-so, the day will be your realm.’ Likewise for the second one, he said to him: ‘So-and-so, the night will be your realm.’ So, too, “God called the light, Day”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This can also be translated: “God called out to the light: Day [will be your realm].”</i> – He said to it: ‘The day will be your realm.’ “And to the darkness He called Night” – He said to it: ‘The night will be your realm.’ Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That is what the Holy One blessed be He says to Job: “In all your days, have you commanded the morning and apprised darkness of its place?” (Job 38:12) – have you informed it of its place, where it is? This was a rhetorical question. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I will say the source for this: “He forms light and creates darkness, He makes peace” (Isaiah 45:7) – after they were created, He made peace [between them]. <br>“God called the light, Day” – Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One blessed be He never associates His name with the bad, but only with the good. “God called the light, Day and to the darkness God called night” is not written here, but rather, “to the darkness He called night.”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding darkness, the pronoun “He” is used instead of God’s name.</i>
Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: “It will be evening” is not written here, but rather, “it was evening” – from here we learn that there had been an order to time even beforehand.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Even before the creation on the fourth day of the sun and the moon, which are the conventional means of marking time. “It will be evening” would have meant that on the first few days, it was noted that later on there would be evening and morning.</i>  <br>Rabbi Abahu said: This teaches that He continuously created worlds and destroyed them, until He created the current one, and said: ‘This one pleases Me, those did not please Me.’ Rabbi Pinḥas said: The source for Rabbi Abahu is: “God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good” (Genesis 1:31) – this pleases Me, those did not please Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">“Behold” implies that there was a new, improved situation that had not been there before.</i>
Rabbi Yanai said: Right from the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One blessed be He foresaw the actions of the righteous and the actions of the wicked. “The earth was emptiness” (Genesis 1:2) – these are the actions of the wicked. “God said: Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3) – these are the actions of the righteous. “God distinguished between the light and the darkness” (Genesis 1:4) – between the actions of the righteous and the actions of the wicked. “God called the light, Day” (Genesis 1:5) – these are the actions of the righteous. “And to the darkness He called Night” (Genesis 1:5) – these are the actions of the wicked. “It was evening” (Genesis 1:5) – these are the actions of the wicked. “And it was morning” (Genesis 1:5) – these are the actions of the righteous.  <br>“[It was evening and it was morning,] one day”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Why does it state “one day” rather than “the first day,” as it states “the second day” (Genesis 1:8), etc.?</i> – the Holy One blessed be He gave to them [to Israel] one [unique] day. Which is that? It is Yom Kippur. Rabbi Tanḥum bar Yirmeya said: [It was the day] on which four items were created: Mountains, the heavens, the earth, and light.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The creations on the first day were more significant than the others, and in that sense it is unique.</i> Rabbi Yudan said: [It was the day] on which the Holy One blessed be He was alone in His world, as there was no one else in His world other than Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It was the only day on which God was truly “one,” as on the second days there were already angels.</i> This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, but it is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The angels [<i>malakhim</i>] were created on the second day. That is what is written: “He covers His upper chambers with water;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This is what God did on the second day (Genesis 1:6–7).</i> He makes clouds His chariot; He proceeds on the wings of wind” (Psalms 104:3), and it is written: “He makes the winds His messengers [<i>malakhav</i>]” (Psalms 104:4). Rabbi Ḥanina said: The angels were created on the fifth day, as it is stated: “Let birds fly [<i>yeofef</i>] over the earth…” (Genesis 1:20) and it is written: “And with two<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The seraphim had six wings, using two of them for flight (Isaiah 6:2).</i> it would fly [<i>yeofef</i>]” (Isaiah 6:2). Rabbi Lulyana bar Tavrai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Both according to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina and according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, everyone agrees that none were created on the first day, so people should not say: Mikhael was pulling at the south side of the heavens and Gabriel at its north side, while the Holy One blessed be straightened it out it in the middle. Rather, “I am the Lord, who made everything; who stretched out the heavens alone, who spread the earth by Myself [<i>me’iti</i>]” (Isaiah 44:24) – it [the last word] is written [as two]:<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Although the word is pronounced (<i>keri</i>) <i>me’iti,</i> in the biblical text it is written (<i>ketiv</i>) as two words, <i>mi iti</i>.</i> “who is with Me [<i>mi iti</i>]?” Who was partner with Me in creation of the world?
Rabbi Shmuel bar Ami said: From the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One blessed be He desired to enter into a partnership with the creations below.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">To have his Divine Presence rest among His creations.</i> Either way, it [the wording of the verse] is difficult. If it [the counting of the days] was for the purpose of a tally, it should have said: ‘One, two, three,’ or else ‘first, second, third’; is it proper to say: ‘One, second, third?’ This is bewildering.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The explanation is that “one day” is an allusion to the one God, who attached His name to the day when the creation of the world began to show His desire to be together with them.</i> When did the Holy One blessed be He repay them?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">By altering the proper wording of the numbering of days, it is as if God owed them something.</i> It was later, at the establishment of the Tabernacle, as it is stated: “The one who presented his offering on the first day” (Numbers 7:12) – [alluding to] the first [day] of the creation of the world. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘It is as though I created the world on that day.’<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">It was on that day, which was the day the Tabernacle was erected, on the first of Nisan (Exodus 40:17), when God’s original desire was realized and His Divine Presence rested among His creations below..</i> <br>It was taught: That day was conferred with ten crowns.

Chapter 4

<b>“God said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and let it divide between water and water” (Genesis 1:6).</b>  <br>“God said: Let there be a firmament” – it is written: “He roofs His upper chambers with water” (Psalms 104:3). The way of the world is that a flesh-and-blood king builds a palace and roofs it with stones, wood, and earth. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so, He roofed His world only with water, as it is stated: “He roofs His upper chambers with water.”
“God said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water” – the Rabbis say it in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina, Rabbi Pinḥas, and Rabbi Yaakov bar Avin in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: When the Holy One blessed be He said: “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water,” the middle drop [of water] congealed and thereby the lower heavens and the upper highest heavens came about. Rav said: Their substance on the first day<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When God “created the heavens” (Genesis 1:1).</i> was damp, and on the second day they congealed. “Let there be a firmament” – let the firmament harden. Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: Let there be a lining for the firmament [<i>rakia</i>], as it says: “They flattened [<i>vayraku</i>] the sheets of gold” (Exodus 39:3). Rabbi Ḥanina said: Fire emerged from on High and passed over the surface of the firmament.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Drying it, in accordance with the opinion of Rav.</i> When Rabbi Yoḥanan would reach this verse: “With His wind, the heavens are enhanced” (Job 26:13), he would say: Rabbi Ḥanina taught me well. Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Shimon said: The fire emerged from on High and burnished the surface of the firmament. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: The act of Creation came to teach something about the giving of the Torah, but ultimately learned something from it. “Like [the day of] a splitting fire” (Isaiah 64:1)<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is speaking of the giving of the Torah, and describes that day as being like another day, one of fire splitting something in two. </i> – when did fire split between what was above and what was below, was it not at the giving of the Torah?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And the verse compares that day to another day, one of a splitting fire – namely, the day of the creation of the heavens.</i> That is a rhetorical question. So it was at the creation of the world.
Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya: Equivalent to the space between the earth and the firmament, so is the distance between the firmament and the upper waters. “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water” – at the midpoint between them. <br>Rabbi Tanḥuma said: I will say the source. Had it been stated: “God made the firmament and he divided between the waters that were on the firmament,” I would have said that the upper waters rest directly upon the firmament. But since it says: “And the waters that were above the firmament” (Genesis 1:7) – [it indicates that] the upper waters are suspended [above the firmament] by the word of God. Rabbi Aḥa said: It is like the flame in a lamp.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The wick does not stand on the bottom of the lamp, but is suspended above it, as it were, by the oil. </i> And its fruits are rainwater.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The upper waters produce rain, but, as when a tree produces fruit, they are not depleted by the rainfall.</i>
A certain Samaritan asked Rabbi Meir, saying to him: ‘Is it possible that the upper waters are suspended by the word of God?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘Bring me a tube with water.’ He brought him a tube with water. He placed a gold plate on top if it, and the water did not stay in place;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">It spilled out of the bottom of the tube.</i> [he placed] a silver plate, and the water did not stay in place. When he put his finger on top of it, the water stayed in place. He said to him: ‘You are placing your finger there.’ He said to him: ‘If I am flesh and blood and my finger can suspend the water, the finger of the Holy One blessed be He, all the more so.’ Thus, the upper waters are suspended by the word of God. <br>He [the Samaritan] said to him: ‘Is it possible that the One in whose regard it is written: “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth” (Jeremiah 23:24), would speak to Moses from between the two staves of the Ark [in the Tabernacle]?’ He said to him: ‘Bring me large mirrors.’ He said to him: ‘Look at your reflection in them.’ He saw that it [his reflection] was large. He said to him: ‘Bring me small mirrors.’ He brought him small mirrors. He said to him: ‘Look at your reflection in them.’ He saw that it was small. He said to him: ‘If you, who are flesh and blood, are able to change yourself into anything you wish, the One who spoke and made the world come into being, blessed be He, all the more so.’ Thus, when He wishes, “do I not fill the heavens and the earth,” and when he wishes He speaks to Moses from between the two staves of the Ark. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Isi said: At times, the world and its contents cannot contain the glory of his Godliness; at other times He speaks with a person from between the hairs of his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Sometimes God’s presence is concentrated into such a small area that it is comparable to the space between hairs.</i> That is what is written: “The Lord answered Job from the tempest [<i>hase’ara</i>]” (Job 38:1) – from between the hairs [<i>saarot</i>] of his head. <br>He further asked him, saying to him: ‘“The stream of God<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The source of rainwater.</i> is full of water” (Psalms 65:10) – [it has rained] since the six days of Creation and yet nothing is missing?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The stream is still called “full.”</i> This is bewildering.’ He said to him: ‘Go take a bath, and weigh yourself before you go in [to the bathhouse] and after you have gone in.’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">After you have bathed.</i> He went. When he came out and weighed himself he was missing nothing. He said to him: ‘All the perspiration that you excreted, did it not come out of you?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘If you, who are flesh and blood, nothing was missing from your fount, from the fount of the Holy One blessed be He, all the more so.’ Thus, “the stream of God is full of water” – [it has rained] since the six days of Creation and nothing is missing. <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One blessed be He took all of the primordial waters and situated them half in the firmament and half in the ocean. That is, “the stream [<i>peleg</i>] of God is full of water” – half [<i>palga</i>].
The firmament is similar to a pool of water and above the pool is a dome. Because of the pool there is condensation of thick drops, and they descend into the salt water but do not intermingle. Rabbi Yona said: Do not wonder; the Jordan passes through the Sea of Tiberias but does not intermingle [with its water]. <br>There is miraculous process involved in this matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The matter of rainfall.</i> When a person sifts wheat or stubble in a sieve, before they fall two or three fingerbreadths they are already intermingled, but these [raindrops] travel a distance of several years and do not intermingle with one another. <br>Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Shimon says: He rains them down by measure, as it is stated: “For He deducts [<i>yigara</i>] drops of water” (Job 36:27), just as it says: “It will be deducted [<i>venigra</i>] from your valuation” (Leviticus 27:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">All deduction is by measure.</i> <br>The thickness of the earth is equivalent to the thickness of the firmament, as it is stated: “It is He who sits over the circuit [<i>ḥug</i>] of the earth…” (Isaiah 40:22), “in the circuit [<i>ḥug</i>] of the heavens He makes His way” (Job 22:14) – the words <i>ḥug ḥug </i>provide a verbal analogy.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Establishing a comparison between the earth and the heavens. </i> Rav Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: It is like a sheet of metal.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The firmament is not as thick as the earth; rather it is extremely thin.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua bar Rabbi Neḥemya said: It is approximately two or three fingerbreadths [thick].  <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: The upper waters contain approximately thirty <i>kesustas</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A certain measure of volume.</i> more than the lower – “and let it divide between water and water [<i>lamayim</i>]” – <i>lamed </i>equals thirty.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The numerical value of <i>lamayim</i> is thirty more than the numerical value of <i>mayim</i>.</i> The Rabbis say: It is half and half.
<b>“God made the firmament, and divided between the water that was under the firmament and the water that was above the firmament; and it was so” (Genesis 1:7).</b> <br>“God made the firmament” – this is one of the verses due to which ben Zoma stirred up commotion in the world. “[God] made”? This is bewildering; for were they not [brought about] by God’s mere word? That is, “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; by the breath of His mouth, all their hosts” (Psalms 33:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The verb “made” is employed in reference to something formed by the word of God.</i> <br>Why is “that it was good” not written regarding the second day?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">As it is regarding all the other days of Creation.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan taught it in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥalafta: It is because Gehenna was created on it, as it is stated: “For the inferno is arranged from yesterday” (Isaiah 30:33) – a day that has a yesterday, but does not have a day before yesterday.  <br>Rabbi Ḥanina says: It is because division was created, as it is stated: “And let it divide between water and water.” Rabbi Tavyomei said: If on account of division that is for the improvement of the world and its settlement, there is no “that it was good,” division that causes turmoil in the world, all the more so. <br>Rabbi Shmuel [bar Naḥman] said: It is because the work of creating water was not completed.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Only on the third day did the water assume its final form (Genesis 1:9).</i> That is why “that it was good” is written twice on the third day; once for the work of creating the water, and once for the other work done on that day. <br>A certain noblewoman asked Rabbi Yosei, saying to him: ‘Why is “that it was good” not written regarding the second day?’ He said to her: ‘Nevertheless, it ultimately returned and included everything at the end, as it is stated: “God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good”’ (Genesis 1:31). She said to him: ‘This is analogous to six people who come to you and you give each one of them a <i>maneh</i>, but to one of them you do not give a <i>maneh</i>. You then give one <i>maneh </i>for everyone [to be divided among them] – will the result not be that they all have a <i>maneh </i>and a sixth in their hands, but one of them has only one sixth of a <i>maneh </i>in his hand?’ This was a rhetorical question. He then said to her in accordance with what Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: ‘It is because the work of creating water was not completed.’ That is why “that it was good” is written twice on the third day; once for the work of creating water, and once for the other work done on that day.  <br>Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai: It is written: “He tells the outcome from the outset” (Isaiah 46:10) – from the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that Moses would be called “good” (Exodus 2:2) and that he was destined to receive his [punishment] because of it [water].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Because of his wrongful actions at the Waters of Meriva (Numbers 20:12–13).</i> That is why “that it was good” is not written regarding it. <br>Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: This is analogous to a king who had a ruthless legion. The king said: ‘Since this legion is ruthless, let my name not be written in association with it.’ So, too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Since the generation of the Flood, the generation of Enosh, and the generation of the Dispersion were all penalized by it [water], therefore, let “that it was good” not be written in association with it.’
<b>“God called the firmament heavens. It was evening and it was morning, a second day” (Genesis 1:8).</b> <br>“God called the firmament heavens [<i>shamayim</i>]” – Rav said: [The word indicates] fire [<i>esh</i>] and water [<i>mayim</i>]. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rav: The Holy One blessed be He took fire and water and integrated them with one another, and from them the heavens were made. Alternatively, <i>shamim </i>is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The letters of <i>shamayim</i> can also be read <i>shamim</i>.</i> as they assess [<i>shamim</i>] the actions of the people. If they merit, “the heavens declare his righteousness” (Psalms 97:6); if not, “the heavens reveal his iniquity” (Job 20:27). <br>Another matter, <i>shamayim </i>– because the creations wonder [<i>mishtomem</i>] in their regard, saying: ‘Of what do they consist? Are they of fire, are they of water? It is a wonder.’ Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Levi: He [God] came and settled it: “He roofs His upper chambers with water” (Psalms 104:3); that is, they are of water. <br>[Another interpretation: The word indicates] dyes [<i>samim</i>] – just as with dyes, some are green, some are red, some are black, and some are white, so, too, the heavens, at times they are green, at times they are red, at times they are black, and at times they are white. <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “<i>Shamayim</i>” – <i>sa mayim</i>, bearing water.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The upper waters are on top of the heavens.</i>  <br>It is analogous to milk that was placed in a bowl. Until a drop of rennet falls into it, it is loose. When one drop of rennet falls into it, it congeals and becomes set [<i>omed</i>]. So, too, “The pillars [<i>amudei</i>] of heaven were loose” (Job 26:11) – the heavens became set when He put His rennet in them, “and it was evening and it was morning, a second day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This took place on the second day.</i> This is in accordance with what Rav said: They were moist on the first day and congealed on the second day.

Chapter 5

<b>“God said: Let the water under the heavens be gathered to one place, and let the dry land appear, and it was so” (Genesis 1:9).</b> <br>“God said: Let the water…be gathered [<i>yikavu</i>]” – it is written: “At Your rebuke they fled; at the sound [of Your thunder they rushed away]” (Psalms 104:7). Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Ami: Let a set measure be established for the water, as it says: “A plumb line [<i>kav</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kav</i> is used for measurement in building.</i> will be extended over Jerusalem” (Zechariah 1:16). <br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let the water eagerly await [<i>yekavu</i>] for Me, for what I am going to do with it in the future.’ This is analogous to a king who built a palace and settled mute people in it. They would rise early and inquire regarding the king’s wellbeing with gestures, with fingers, and with kerchiefs. The king said: ‘If they could speak, would it not be even more so?’ This was a rhetorical question. The king then settled speaking residents in it. They rose and seized the palace and said: ‘This palace is not the king’s; it is ours.’ The king said: ‘Let the palace be restored to its previous state.’ So, from the beginning of the creation of the world the praises of the Holy One blessed be He would arise only from the water, as it is written: “It is from the sound of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea” (Psalms 93:4). What would they say? “The Lord is mighty on High” (Psalms 93:4). [God said:] ‘If these [waters] that have no ability to talk and speak, and yet they laud Me, when I create Man, all the more so.’ [But] the generation of the Flood arose and rebelled against Him, the generation of Enosh arose and rebelled against Him, the generation of the Dispersion arose and rebelled against Him. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let these [mankind] be expelled, and let those who had dwelled here before arise and come back.’ That is what is written: “The rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights” (Genesis 7:12).
“To one place” – Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Levi, and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Shimon say: The world in its entirety was all water, and you say “[gathered] to one place”? This is bewildering. It is analogous to ten inflated wineskins that were located in a hall. The king needed their space. What did he do to them? He untied them, let their air out, and removed them into a corner. So, the Holy One blessed be He trod upon the primordial waters<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Pushing them down.</i> and diverted them into the ocean. That is what is written: “Behold, He halts [<i>ya’atzor</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ya’atzor</i> can also mean He presses.</i> the water and it dries…” (Job 12:15); “He treads on the crests of the sea” (Job 9:8).
Rabbi Levi said: The waters said to one another: ‘Let us go and fulfill the command of the Holy One blessed be He.’ That is what is written: “The rivers raise, Lord; the rivers raise their voices. [The rivers boost their towering waves [<i>dokhyam</i>]]” (Psalms 93:3). Rabbi Levi said: [They exclaimed:] ‘Via the sea [<i>derekh yam</i>], via the sea.’ Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: ‘To such-and-such place [<i>dukhta</i>], to such-and-such corner, such-and-such waves.’ Rav Huna said: ‘To this sea [<i>hadakh yama</i>], to this sea.’ Rabbi Yehoshua bar Ḥanina said: ‘To water channels [<i>dukhsa yam</i>], to water channels.’ <br>Rabbi Elazar said: The sea absorbed them, just as you say: “Have you entered into the depths of the sea?” (Job 38:16) – within the boundaries of the sea. The Rabbis say: [The waters exclaimed:] ‘We are pressed down [<i>dokhim</i>], receive us. We are broken [<i>medukhanim</i>], receive us.’ <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Rabbi Neḥemya said: The water would ascend mountains and descend depths until it reached the ocean. That is what is written: “They rose to the mountains, descended [in the valleys to the place You established for them]” (Psalms 104:8). What place did You establish for them? This is the ocean.  <br>Rabbi Abahu expounded: The ocean is higher than the entire world, and the whole world in its entirety drinks from its water.
Rabbi Levi said: Some of the expounders, like ben Azai and ben Zoma, expounded: The voice of the Holy One blessed be He became a guide for Moses, when he said to him: “Ascend to Mount Avarim” (Deuteronomy 32:49). The voice of the Holy One blessed be He became a guide for the water. That is what is written: “The voice of the Lord is on the water” (Psalms 29:3). <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: The lower waters separated from the upper only with weeping [<i>bekhiya</i>]. That is what is written: “He dams the depths of [<i>mibekhi</i>] the rivers” (Job 28:11). Rabbi Tanḥum derives it from here: “He makes the earth with His might…. At the sound [<i>kol</i>] of His placement of a multitude of water [in the heavens]” (Jeremiah 10:12–13), and <i>kol </i>is nothing other than weeping, just as it says: “So said the Lord: A voice [<i>kol</i>] is heard in Rama, ]wailing, bitter weeping[” (Jeremiah 31:15).
Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One blessed be He stipulated a condition with the sea [upon its creation] that it should split before Israel. That is what is written: “The sea returned to its power [<i>le’eitano</i>]” (Exodus 14:27), in accordance with its condition [<i>litna’o</i>] that He stipulated with it. <br>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: It is not only with the sea alone that the Holy One blessed be He stipulated, but with everything that was created during the six days of Creation. That is what is written: “My hands stretched the heavens and commanded all their host” (Isaiah 45:12) – right from when “My hands stretched the heavens,” “I commanded all their host.” I commanded the sea that it should split before Israel. I commanded the heavens and the earth that they should be silent before Moses, as it is stated: “Listen, the heavens, and I will speak, and the earth will hear the sayings of my mouth” (Deuteronomy 32:1). I commanded the sun and the moon that they should stand still before Joshua, as it is stated: “Sun, stand still at Givon; [and Moon, in the Valley of Ayalon]” (Joshua 10:12). I commanded the ravens that they should sustain Elijah, as it is stated: “The ravens would bring him bread and meat…” (I Kings 17:6). I commanded the fire that it should not harm Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya. I commanded the lions that they should not harm Daniel. I commanded the heavens that they should open before Ezekiel, as it is stated: “The heavens opened…” (Ezekiel 1:1). I commanded the fish that it should spew out Jonah, as it is stated: “The Lord said to the fish, and it spewed out Jonah” (Jonah 2:11).
Rabbi Elazar said: At the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One blessed be He decreed: “Let the water…be gathered.” Why [is it written:] “He calls the water of the sea” (Amos 5:8), “He calls the water of the sea” (Amos 9:6) twice? Once for the generation of the Flood and once for the generation of Enosh.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The implied question is: Since God decreed at creation that the waters should be limited to one place, how is it that they subsequently came back and covered the earth? (see <i>Devarim Rabba</i> 10:2).</i> It is because: “God acted so they would be in fear of Him” (Ecclesiastes 3:14). This is analogous to a province that rebelled against the king. The king sent a powerful legion and surrounded it so that the residents of the province would see it and be in fear of him. So, why is it that: “He heaps together the water of the sea”? (Psalms 33:7). It is so “the entire earth would be in fear of the Lord…” (Psalms 33:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The water was gathered together into one place so that men would see it and be in fear that it may come back and cover them.</i>
The way of the world is that a person empties a full vessel into an empty vessel. Can one, perhaps, pour a full vessel into a full vessel? The world in its entirety is all water, and yet you say “to one place”? But from here [we see] that a smaller space was able to contain a greater amount [than its size]. <All of these appear in the midrash of <i>Kohelet </i>and in <i>Vayikra Rabba </i>19:9>.  <br>Similarly, “Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly [to the front of the rock]” (Numbers 20:10). It [the front of the rock] was the size of a small sieve, and yet all of Israel was standing before it? But from here [we see] that a smaller space was able to contain a greater amount [than its size]. <br>Similarly, “the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Take for yourselves [cupped handfuls of soot of a furnace]” (Exodus 9:8). Rav Huna said: Did Moses’s cupped hand hold eight clenched handfuls? This is bewildering. A cupped handful and a clenched handful are not the same; a cupped handful holds twice as much as a clenched handful.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">God told Moses and Aaron (two people) to take “handfuls”, in the plural, indicating two handfuls each, totaling four handfuls, each handful being equal to two clenched handfuls, for a total of eight.</i> And it is written: “Moses threw it” (Exodus 9:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">And to throw powerfully one must use one hand.</i> It emerges, then, that the cupped hand of Moses held eight clenched handfuls. But from here [we see] that a smaller space was able to contain a greater amount [than its size]. <br>Similarly, Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta said: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the width shall be fifty on each side” (Exodus 27:18), and yet all of Israel could stands inside of it?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Leviticus 8:3.</i> This is bewildering. But from here [we see] that a smaller space was able to contain a greater amount [than its size]. <br>Similarly, “Joshua said to the children of Israel: Come here…” (Joshua 3:9). Rav Huna said: He had them stand up between the two staves of the Ark. Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: He had them all lean on one another between the two staves of the Ark. Rava said: He crowded them between the two staves of the Ark. Joshua said to them: ‘From the fact that the two staves of the Ark was able to contain you all, you may know that the Divine Presence of the Holy One blessed be He is in your midst.’ That is what is written: “Joshua said: With this you will know that the living God is in your midst” (Joshua 3:10).  <br>This was so in Jerusalem, too, as we learned: They stood crowded, but prostrated themselves spaciously.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 21a.</i> Rabbi Shmuel ben Rabbi Ḥana said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: There were four cubits for each person to occupy, and a [further] cubit on each side so that none of them would hear the prayer of the other. <br>This will be so in the future, too, as it is stated: “At that time, they will call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord, and all the nations will be gathered into it” (Jeremiah 3:17). Rabbi Yoḥanan ascended to inquire after the wellbeing of Rabbi Ḥanina and found him sitting and expounding this verse: “At that time, they will call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord, [and all the nations will be gathered into it].” He said to him: ‘Can Jerusalem contain the Throne of the Lord?’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And all the nations.</i> He said to him: ‘The Holy One blessed is He will say to it: Expand and extend and receive your populations.’ That is what is written: “Expand the place of your tent” (Isaiah 54:3).

<b>“God said: Let the earth sprout grass, vegetation yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in their kind, in which there is its seed, upon the earth, and it was so” (Genesis 1:11).</b> <br>“God said: Let the earth sprout grass” – it is taught in the name of Rabbi Natan: There were three who were brought to judgment, but there were four who emerged liable. They are as follows: Adam, Eve, and the serpent were brought to judgment, and the ground was cursed along with them, as it is stated: “Cursed is the ground on your account” (Genesis 3:17) – it will produce for you cursed items, such as gnats, flies, and fleas.

Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom and Rabbi Pinḥas, Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom said: Because it violated its command, as the Holy One blessed be He said to it: “Let the earth sprout grass, [vegetation yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in their kind]” – just as the fruit is edible, so should the tree be edible. But, it [the earth] did not do so, but rather, “The earth produced grass…[and trees bearing fruit]” (Genesis 1:12) – the fruit is edible but the tree is not edible. Rabbi Pinḥas said: [On the contrary,] it did even more than it was commanded, taking the initiative in fulfilling the will of its Creator. “Trees bearing fruit” – even the non-fruit trees produced fruit. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shimon, all is well, but according to Rabbi Pinḥas, why was it [the earth] cursed?

Chapter 6

<b>“God said: Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to distinguish between the day and the night; let them be for signs, for appointed times, for days, and years” (Genesis 1:14).</b> <br>“God said: Let there be lights” – Rabbi Yoḥanan began: “He made the moon for appointed times” (Psalms 104:19). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It was only the sun that was created to illuminate.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Let there be” (<i>yehi</i>) is in the singular.</i> If so, why was the moon created? For the appointed times, in order to sanctify New Moons and years according to its calculation. <br>Rabbi Shilo of Kefar Tamarta said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even though “He made the moon for the appointed times,” “the sun knows its setting” (Psalms 104:19) – [the month is counted only] from the time that “the sun knows its setting.” One does not count [the months] by the moon until after the sun has set.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If the astronomical new moon takes place during the day, the calendric New Moon is not fixed on that day, but only upon the next setting of the sun, which is the start of the following day.</i> Yusti Ḥavra said in the name of Rabbi Berekhya: It says: “They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the month” (Numbers 33:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages had a tradition that the astronomical new moon of the month of the Exodus was after noon on a Wednesday, and that the Exodus took place two weeks later, on a Thursday.</i> If you count according to the moon,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The visibility of the moon.

Accordingly, the Exodus itself occurred on the fifteenth.</i> <br>Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: It was only the sun that was created to illuminate. If so, why was the moon created? It is that it teaches that the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that the idolaters were destined to make them [the sun and the moon] into gods. The Holy One blessed be He said: If even when they challenge one another,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">By both being present together in the sky.</i> the idolaters make them into gods, had there been only one [luminary], all the more so.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The moon was created in order to diminish the inclination to treat the sun as a deity.</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Simon: Both of them were created to illuminate, as it is stated: “They shall serve as lights” (Genesis 1:15); “God set them in the firmament of the heavens [to illuminate upon the earth]” (Genesis 1:17). <br>“Let them be for signs” – these are Shabbatot; “and for appointed times” – these are the three pilgrimage festivals; “for days” – these are New Moons; “and years” – this is the sanctification of years.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The determination by a religious court when a new year should begin.</i>
“The day is Yours, night is Yours, as well” (Psalms 74:16) – the day lauds You and the night lauds You. Just as the day is in Your domain, so the night is in Your domain. When You perform miracles for us during the day, “the day is Yours,” and when You perform miracles for us at night, “night is Yours, as well.” When You perform miracles for us during the day, we recite songs to You during the day. When You perform miracles for us at night, we recite songs to You at night. You performed miracles for us during the day and we recited songs to You during the day: “Deborah and Barak son of Avinoam sang on [that] day…” (Judges 5:1). You performed miracles for us at night and we recited song to You at night: “The song will be for you, like the night of the consecration of the festival” (Isaiah 30:29). To You it is appropriate to recite songs during the day; to You it is appropriate to recite songs at night. Why? “You founded light and the sun” (Psalms 74:16). And You made the two lights, as it is stated: “God made the two great lights…” (Genesis 1:16).
Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum ben Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Simon said: After He calls them [both] great, He goes ahead and diminishes them, [saying] “The greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night”? (Genesis 1:16). This is bewildering. But it is because one of them entered into the realm of its counterpart.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The moon encroached upon the realm of the sun, as it is visible at times during the day. For this reason its light was diminished.</i> Rabbi Pinḥas said: Regarding all the [holiday] offerings it says: “One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 29:5), but regarding the New Moon it is written: “One goat as a sin offering for the Lord” (Numbers 28:15). The Holy One blessed be He said [as it were]: Bring atonement on My behalf for having diminished the moon, as it is I who caused it to enter into the realm of its counterpart. Now, if this one that entered [into its counterpart’s realm] with permission was diminished by Scripture, one who enters [his neighbor’s realm] without permission, all the more so. <br>Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ilai: It is only proper for the greater [older] one to count by the greater thing, and the smaller [younger] one to count by the lesser thing. Esau counts [its years] by the sun, which is the greater, and Jacob counts [its years] by the moon, which is the lesser. <br>Rav Naḥman said: And this is a good portent. Esau counts by the sun, which is the greater. Just as the sun has dominion during the day and has no dominion at night, so Esau has a share in this world and has no share in the World to Come. Jacob counts by the moon, which is lesser. Just as the moon has dominion during both night and day, so Jacob has a share in both this world and in the World to Come. <br>Rav Naḥman said: As long as the light of the greater one is in existence, the light of the lesser one is not discernible. When the light of the greater one recedes, the light of the lesser one is discernible. So, too, as long as the light of Esau is in existence, the light of Jacob is not discernible. When the light of Esau will recede, the light of Jacob will be discernible. That is what is written: “Arise, shine, for your light has come…. For, behold, the darkness will cover the earth, [and thick darkness the peoples, but upon you the Lord will shine and His glory will be seen upon you]” (Isaiah 60:1–2).
“And the stars” (Genesis 1:16) – Rav Aḥa said: This is analogous to a king who had two stewards, one ruled [only] over the city and one ruled over the [rest of the] province. The king said: ‘Since this one diminished himself [and consented] to be ruler over the city, I decree concerning him that whenever he goes out, a large crowd should go out with him, and when he enters, the city council and the multitudes should enter with him.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Since the moon diminished itself to rule at night, I decree concerning it that when it goes out, the stars should go out with it, and when it goes in,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When it sets.</i> the stars should go in with it.’  <br>Similarly, “the name of his brother was Yoktan” (Genesis 10:25) – Rabbi Aḥa said: Why was he named Yoktan? It is because he would minimize [<i>maktin</i>] his affairs.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He was humble.</i> What did he merit? He merited producing thirteen great families.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 10:26–29.</i> Now, if Yoktan<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Who was the younger brother (Genesis 10:25).</i> received this because he minimized his affairs, if an important man minimizes his affairs, all the more so. <br>Similarly, “Israel extended his right hand, and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger” (Genesis 48:14) – Rabbi Ḥonya said: Do we not know from the accounts of the births that he was the younger? What, then, is “who was the younger [<i>tza’ir</i>]”? It is because he would minimize [<i>matzir</i>] his affairs. What did he merit? He merited the birthright.

<b>“God set them in the firmament of the heavens to illuminate upon the earth” (Genesis 1:17).</b> <br>“God set them in the firmament of the heavens” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three items were given as a gift [<i>matana</i>] to the world: The Torah, the lights, and the rains. The Torah, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “He gave [<i>vayiten</i>] to Moses [the two tablets of Testimony]” (Exodus 31:18). The lights, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “God set [<i>vayiten</i>] them in the firmament of the heavens.” The rains, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “I will provide [<i>venatati</i>] your rains in their seasons” (Leviticus 26:4). Rabbi Azarya says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: Peace, as well, as it is stated: “I will grant [<i>venatati</i>] peace in the land” (Leviticus 26:6). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Rabbi Neḥemya said: Salvation, as well, as it is stated: “You have given [<i>vatiten</i>] me the shield of Your salvation” (Psalms 18:36). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: The Land of Israel, as well, as it is stated: “He gave [<i>vayiten</i>] them the lands of the nations…” (Psalms 105:44). Some say, vengeance against Edom, as well, as it is stated: “I will set [<i>venatati</i>] My vengeance upon Edom…” (Ezekiel 25:14). The Rabbis say: Mercy, as well, as it is stated: “He situated [<i>vayiten</i>] them for mercy before their captors” (Psalms 106:46).  <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon says: Setting sail in the Great Sea, as well, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, who makes [<i>noten</i>] a way in the sea…” (Isaiah 43:16).

He said to him: ‘My son will go without burial, as it is stated: “Moreover, he has no burial”’ (Ecclesiastes 6:3). He heeded neither the words of this one nor the words of that one, and so it befell him.
Where are the orbs of the sun and the moon situated? They are in the second firmament, as it is stated: “God set them in the firmament of the heavens.” Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Abahu: There is an explicit verse, and the members of the Great Assembly elaborated on it: “You, the Lord, alone, You made the heavens, the heaven of heavens, and all their host…” (Nehemiah 9:6). Where is all their host situated? It is in the firmament that is above the heavens. From the earth to the firmament is a distance of five hundred years’ walk, and the thickness of the firmament is a distance of five hundred years’ walk, and from firmament to firmament is a distance of five hundred years’ walk. See how high it is. And we learned, on the first day of the summer solstice, there is no shade for any creature,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The sun is directly overhead.</i> as it is written: “Nothing can shelter from its heat” (Psalms 19:7).  <br>The orb of the sun has a sheath, as it is stated: “In a tent within, He placed the sun” (Psalms 19:5), and there is a pool of water before it. When it emerges [from the sheath], the Holy One blessed be He mitigates its strength through that water so that it should not emerge and incinerate the world. But in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will strip it of its sheath and burn the wicked with it, as it is stated: “The day that is coming will burn them” (Malachi 3:19). <br>Rabbi Yanai and Rabbi Shimon both say: There will be no Gehenna [in the future];<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">On Judgment Day the wicked will not receive their punishment by fire in Gehenna.</i> rather, there will be a [scorching] day that will burn up the wicked.

The Rabbis say: There will be a Gehenna,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">An actual fire.</i> as it is stated: “The utterance of the Lord, for whom there is fire in Zion…” (Isaiah 31:9). Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai says: There will be neither a [scorching] day nor a Gehenna, but rather, a fire that emerges from the body of the wicked themselves and burns them. What is the source? It is as it is written: “Conceive stubble, give birth to straw, your spirit is a fire that will consume you” (Isaiah 33:11). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua bar Avin said: “The heavens will declare His beneficence” (Psalms 50:6) – in the future, the heavens will relate the beneficence that the Holy One blessed be He bestowed upon His world, in that He did not situate them in the first firmament. Had He situated them in the first firmament, no creature could have withstood the fire of the day.

Rabbi Levi said: “Depths call out to depths in the sound [of your waterways]” (Psalms 42:8). The soul at the moment that it leaves the body, from where is it derived?

<b>“And to rule during the day and at night, and to divide between the light and the darkness, and God saw that it was good” (Genesis 1:18).</b> <br>“And to rule during the day and at night” – Rabbi Ilfa said: If this is referring to the lights, is it not already stated: “The greater light to rule the day”? Genesis 1:16). Why, then, does the verse state: “And to rule during the day and at night”? Rather, it is referring to the righteous, who exert control over the body that was created to illuminate during the day and the body that was created to illuminate at night. That is what is written: “The sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance against their enemies. Is it not written in the book of the upright?” (Joshua 10:13).

Did my ancestor not see you in a dream: “Behold, the sun and the moon…[were prostrating themselves to me]”?’ (Genesis 37:9). Thereupon, “the sun stood still, and the moon [stopped].”

Yaakov of Kefar Nevorai once issued a ruling in Tyre that fish require ritual slaughter.

It is as it is written: “Will flocks and cattle be slaughtered for them and it suffice for them? If all the fish of the sea will be gathered for them, will it suffice for them?” (Numbers 11:22). “Will be slaughtered” is not written here [regarding fish], but rather, “will be gathered.”’ He said to him: ‘Strike your blows, beat your beating, as it is helpful in learning a lesson.’ <br>Yaakov of Kefar Nevorai once issued a ruling in Tyre that it is permitted to circumcise the son of a non-Jewish woman<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The father of the child being a Jew.</i> on Shabbat.

“And let birds fly” – it is the usual way of the world that a flesh-and-blood king builds a palace and settles occupants in the upper and lower levels. Does he, perhaps, do so in its air space? The Holy One blessed be He, however, settles occupants even in the air space, as it is written: “And let birds fly above the earth…”

Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: When the Holy One blessed be He created Adam the first man, He created him with two faces,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">That is, two conjoined bodies, male and female.</i> and [subsequently] He sawed him in two<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Separating the female part from the male part.</i> and made [for] him two backs,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Where they had previously been joined together.</i> a back here and a back there. They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “He took one of his ribs [<i>tzalotav</i>] … [and the Lord God built the rib that He took from the man into a woman]”? (Genesis 2:21–22). He said to them: [It means that He took] one of his two sides, as it says: “And for the <i>tzela</i> of the Tabernacle” (Exodus 26:20), which we translate: “And for the side of the Tabernacle...”. Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Benaya and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Elazar said: When the Holy One blessed be He created Adam the first man, He created him in an unformed state and he was situated from one end of the world to the other. That is what is written: “Your eyes saw my unformed parts...” (Psalms 139:16). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya and Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon in the name of Rabbi Elazar said: He created him filling the whole world.

From where is it derived that he even filled the empty space of the world?

This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “And the spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the water” (Genesis 1:2) – this is the spirit of the messianic king, as it says: “The spirit of the Lord will rest upon him” (Isaiah 11:2). If a person is meritorious, it is said to him: ‘You preceded the ministering angels’; if not, it is said to him: ‘A fly preceded you, a gnat preceded you, this earthworm preceded you.’ <br>Rav Naḥman said: [Adam was created] last [<i>aḥor</i>] of all the creations, but was first [<i>kedem</i>] for all punishments.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As it says regarding the Flood: “He obliterated all existence that was on the face of the earth, from man, to animal, to crawling creature, to birds of the heavens” (Genesis 7:23).</i> Rabbi Shmuel said: Regarding praising [God] as well, he comes last. That is what is written: “Praise the Lord from the heavens…” (Psalms 148:1), and it says the rest of that passage. Then “praise the Lord from the earth, [sea creatures and all depths]” (Psalms 148:7), and it says the rest of that passage. Only after that it says: “Kings of the earth and all nations…” (Psalms 148:11), “young men and maidens” (Psalms 148:12). <br>Rabbi Samlai said: Just as his praising [of God] is only after the animals, the beasts, and the birds, so his creation was only after the animals, the beasts, and the birds.

Rav Ḥama bar Ḥanina began: “Have you known this from [oldest times?]” (Job 20:4). Rav Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: This is analogous to a city that received its supplies by donkey drivers.

Here, too, everything that was made on each day would ask one another: ‘What creations did the Holy One blessed be He create on your day?’ The sixth day would ask the fifth day, and so on until the first day. Whom would it [the first day] ask? Is it not the Torah, that preceded the creation of the world? As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The Torah preceded the creation of the world by two thousand years. That is what is written: “I was with Him, as a protégé; [I was a delight day after day]”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The speaker is wisdom personified, that is, the Torah.</i> (Proverbs 8:30), and the day of the Holy One blessed be He is one thousand years, as it is written: “As one thousand years in Your eyes are like yesterday” (Psalms 90:4). <sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">So “day after day” is two thousand years.</i> That is, “have you known this [from oldest times?]” (Job 20:4). The Torah knows what preceded the creation of the world.

“And God said: Let us make Man” – with whom did He consult? Rabbi Yehoshua said in the name of Rabbi Levi: He consulted with the works of the heavens and the earth. This is analogous to a king who had two members of his council and he would not do anything without their knowledge. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He consulted with what was made on each and every day. This is analogous to a king who had an adviser and he would not do anything without his knowledge. <br>Rabbi Ami said: He consulted with His heart. This is analogous to a king who built a palace through the services of an architect, but it was not pleasing for him. At whom should he be angry? Is it not the architect? This is a rhetorical question. That is, “He was saddened in His heart” (Genesis 6:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This could also be translated, “He became upset at His heart.”</i> Rav Asi said: This is analogous to a king who conducted a business transaction through an intermediary, and he suffered a loss.

Rabbi Berekhya said: When the Holy One blessed be He came to create Adam the first man, He foresaw righteous and wicked people descending from him. He said: If I create him, wicked people will descend from him. But if I do not create him, how will righteous people ever descend from him? What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He distanced the way of the wicked from His attention, appended the attribute of mercy to Himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In most of the story of creation, only the name Elohim (God) is used, but at the point man is created He is described as Hashem Elohim (the Lord, God).

He eradicated it [the way of the wicked] from before his attention, appended the attribute of mercy to Himself, and created him. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina did not interpret it in that manner. Rather, when He came to create Adam the first man, He consulted the ministering angels and said to them: “Let us make Man in our image, in our likeness” (Genesis 1:26). They said to him: ‘What is his nature?’ He said to them: ‘Righteous people will arise out of him.’ That is what is written: “For the Lord knows [<i>yode’a</i>] the way of the righteous” (Psalms 1:6) – for the Holy One blessed be He informed [<i>hodi’a</i>] the ministering angels about the way of the righteous. “But the way of the wicked will be eradicated” (Psalms 1:6) – He eradicated<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Concealed.</i> it from them.

Rabbi Simon said: When the Holy One blessed be He came to create Adam the first man, the ministering angels divided into various factions and various groups. Some of them were saying: ‘Let him not be created,’ and some of them were saying: ‘Let him be created.’ That is what is written: “Kindness and truth met; righteousness and peace touched” (Psalms 85:11). Kindness said: ‘Let him be created, as he performs acts of kindness.’ Truth said: ‘Let him not be created, as he is all full of lies.’ Righteousness said: ‘Let him be created, as he performs acts of righteousness.’ Peace said: ‘Let him not be created, as he is all full of discord.’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He took Truth and cast it down to earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rejecting its counsel.</i> That is what is written: “You cast truth earthward” (Daniel 8:12). The ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, why are You demeaning Your very seal?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">“Truth” is the seal of the Holy One blessed be He.</i> Let Truth ascend from the earth.’ That is what is written: “Truth will spring from the earth” (Psalms 85:12). <br>The Rabbis say in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi, and Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Ḥilkiya said in the name of Rabbi Simon: <i>Meod</i>, this refers to Man [<i>adam</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Adam and <i>meod</i> are written with the same letters.</i> That is what is written: “God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very [<i>meod</i>] good” (Genesis 1:31) – Man [<i>adam</i>] was good. <br>Rav Huna, the rabbi of Tzippori, said: While the ministering angels were busy deliberating with one another and engaging with one another, the Holy One blessed be He created him. He said to them: ‘Why are you deliberating? Man has already been created.’
Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: He created him wisely, as He created the needs of his sustenance and only then created him. The ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, “what is a mortal that You remember him, a man that You take him into account”? (Psalms 8:5). This trouble, why should it come about?’ He said to them: ‘If so, “all sheep and cattle, all the animals of the field” (Psalms 8:8) – why were they created? “The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea” (Psalms 8:9) – why were they created?’ This is analogous to a king who had a tower filled with all manner of fine things, but he had no guests. What pleasure does the king derive from having filled it? They said before Him: ‘“Lord, our Master, how mighty is Your name throughout the world” (Psalms 8:10) – do what pleases You.’
Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: He consulted with the souls of the righteous. That is what is written: “They are the potters and the inhabitants of Neta’im and Gedera; they dwelled there with the king for his works” (I Chronicles 4:23). “They are the potters [<i>hayotzerim</i>]” – alluding to: “the Lord God formed [<i>vayitzer</i>] man of dust from the ground” (Genesis 2:7). “Inhabitants of Neta’im” – alluding to: “the Lord God planted [<i>vayita</i>] a garden eastward in Eden” (Genesis 2:8). “And Gedera” – after “for I set the sand as a barrier [<i>gader</i>] for the sea” (Jeremiah 5:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">“They are the potters and the inhabitants of Neta’im and Gedera” are all seen as allusions to the righteous, as God created man, planted the Garden, and placed boundaries for the sea only after having consulted with the souls of the righteous.</i> “They dwelled there with the king for his works” (I Chronicles 4:23) – “with the king,” the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, “they dwelled,” [referring to] the souls of the righteous, [“for his works”], as the Holy One blessed be He consulted them when creating the world.
Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: When Moses was writing the Torah, and was writing what was made on each day, when he reached this verse: “And God said: Let us make Man in our image, in our likeness” – he said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, why do you provide the heretics with basis for a claim?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">By making it appear as if God had partners whom He needed to consult.</i> This is bewildering.’ He said to him: ‘Just write, and if someone wants to err, let him err.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Is it not so regarding this man whom I created, that I will bring forth descendants of greater and lesser status? If someone of greater status is about to seek approval from one of lesser stature than he, but he says: Why do I need to seek approval from one who is of lesser stature than I? One may say to him: Learn from your Creator, as He created the heavenly realms and the earthly realms, but when He came to create man, he consulted with the ministering angels.’  <br>Rabbi Levi said: There is no consultation here; rather, this is analogous to a king who was strolling at the entrance to his palace, and saw a large hewn rock set off to the side. He said: ‘What should we use this for?’ Some of them [of his advisers] said: ‘[Use it for] the public baths,’ and others said: ‘For private bathhouses.’ The king said: ‘I am going to craft it into a statue.’<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">A statue in my image.</i> Who will prevent it?<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">God told the angels that He was about to make man in His image, not to consult with them, but to inform them that He was doing so with or without their consent.</i>
The heretics once asked Rabbi Samlai: ‘How many deities created the world?’ He said to them: ‘Let you and I inquire into the early days.’ That is what is written: “For inquire now into the early days that were before you, from the day that God created [<i>bara</i>] man” (Deuteronomy 4:32) – “that [God] <i>baru</i>”<i> </i>is not written here,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Plural.</i> but rather, “that [God] <i>bara.</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Singular.</i> They said to him: ‘What is this that is written: “In the beginning God [<i>Elohim</i>]<i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elohim</i> appears to be a plural term.</i> </i>created”?’ He said to them: “<i>Baru Elohim</i>” is not written here, but rather, “<i>bara Elohim.</i>”  <br>Rabbi Samlai said [moreover]: Everywhere you find a basis for a claim of the heretics, you find a refutation alongside it.

Rabbi Hoshaya said: When the Holy One blessed be He created Adam the first man, the ministering angels erred concerning him and sought to proclaim “holy” before him. This is analogous to a king and a governor who were in a chariot, and the residents of the province wanted to salute the king by proclaiming: <i>Domine</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">O Lord.</i> But they did not know which one he was. What did the king do? He pushed him [the governor] out of the chariot, and then they all knew that he was the governor. So, when the Holy One blessed be He created Adam the first man, the ministering angels erred concerning him and sought to proclaim “holy” before him. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He cast a deep slumber upon him, and everyone then knew that he was [merely] a man. That is what is written: “Desist from man, who has breath in his nostrils, for in what way is he worthy?” (Isaiah 2:22).
<b>“So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female He created them” (Genesis 1:27).</b> <br>“Male and female [<i>unkeva</i>] He created them” – this is one of the words that they changed for King Ptolemy:<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">When Ptolemy gathered seventy Sages to translate the Torah into Greek – the Septuagint (see <i>Megilla </i>9a).

[From the lower realm:] He eats and drinks as does an animal, procreates as does an animal, defecates as does an animal, and dies as does an animal. From the supernal realm: He stands as do the ministering angels, speaks as do the ministering angels, has intelligence as do the ministering angels, and sees as do the ministering angels. But do animals not [also] see? This is bewildering. The difference is that this one [a human] has peripheral vision. <br>Rabbi Tifdai in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The supernal beings were created in the [divine] image and likeness, but do not procreate, while the earthly beings [created before man] procreate but were not created in the [divine] image and likeness. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I will create him [Adam] in the [divine] image and likeness, [a trait] from the supernal realm, but he will procreate, [a trait] from the earthly realm.’ Rabbi Tifdai in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I create him from the supernal realm, he will live and never die; if from the earthly realm, he will die and will not live.

Chapter 9

<b>“God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. It was evening and it was morning, the sixth day” (Genesis 1:31).</b> <br>“God saw everything that He had made…” – Rabbi Levi began: “The glory of God is concealing a matter, but the glory of kings is investigating a matter” (Proverbs 25:2) – Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: From the beginning of the book until here, it is “the glory of God,” [calling for] “concealing a matter.” From here on, “the glory of kings is investigating a matter” – the glory of the words of the Torah that are likened to kings, as it is stated: “Through me kings reign” (Proverbs 8:15),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The speaker is Wisdom personified, that is, the Torah.</i> [calling for] investigating a matter.
Another matter, “God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good” –Rabbi Tanḥuma began: “He made everything beautiful in its time” (Ecclesiastes 3:11) – Rabbi Tanḥuma said: The world was created at its proper time; the world was not fit to be created before then. Rabbi Abbahu said: From here we learn that the Holy One blessed be He continuously created worlds and destroyed them, until He created the current ones, and said: This one pleases me, those did not please Me. Rabbi Pinḥas said: Rabbi Abbahu’s source: “God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good” – this pleases me, those did not please Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">“Behold” implies that there was a new, improved situation that had not been there before.</i>
“God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When a flesh-and-blood king builds a palace, he looks at the upper levels in one glance and at the lower levels in another glance. But the Holy One blessed be He looks at the supernal and the earthly all in one glance. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “Behold, it was very good” – this is this world. “And, behold, it was very good”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The addition of the word “and” is to introduce a second object.</i> – this is the World to Come. The Holy One blessed be He looked at this world and the World to Come in one glance. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: “Alas! My Lord God, behold, You made the heavens and the earth with Your great power and with Your outstretched arm; there is nothing that is obscured from You” (Jeremiah 32:17). From that moment on, there is nothing that is obscured from You.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Every act in history, since the creation of heaven and earth, is known by God.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: “And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve Him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, for the Lord seeks all hearts, and understands all inclinations of thoughts. If you seek Him, He will be accessible to you, but if you forsake Him, He will abandon you forever” (I Chronicles 28:9). Even before a thought is formed in a person’s heart, it is already revealed before Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Most Hebrew texts have “before You”; see Rashash.</i> Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Before a creature is created, his thought is already revealed before Him. Rabbi Yudan himself said: “Even when there is no speech on my tongue, behold, Lord, You know it all” (Psalms 139:4) – even before one’s tongue utters a word, already, “behold, Lord, You know it all.”
Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina and Rabbi Yonatan, Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: This is analogous to a king who built a palace. He saw it and it pleased him. He said: ‘Palace, palace, if only you could always find favor before me just as you have found favor before me at this moment.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to His world: ‘My world, My world, if only you could always find favor before Me just as you have found favor before Me at this moment.’ Rabbi Yonatan said: This is analogous to a king who was marrying off his daughter, and he made her a bridal canopy and chamber, whitewashed it, embossed it, and painted it. He saw it and it pleased him. He said: ‘My daughter, if only this bridal chamber could always find favor before me just as it has found favor before me at this moment.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to His world: ‘My world, My world, if only you could always find favor before Me just as you have found favor before Me at this moment.’
In Rabbi Meir’s Torah they found written: “And, behold, it was very [<i>me’od</i>] good” – and, behold, death [<i>mot</i>] is good.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In a gloss next to the word <i>me’od</i> Rabbi Meir had written <i>mot</i>.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: I was once riding on the shoulders of my grandfather, going up from his city to Kefar Ḥanan via Beit She’an, and I heard Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar sitting and expounding in the name of Rabbi Meir: “And, behold, it was very good” – and, behold, death is good. Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina and Rabbi Yonatan, Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Adam the first man was worthy not to have tasted the taste of death. Why, then, was he penalized with mortality? It is because the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that [his descendants] Nebuchadnezzar and Ḥiram king of Tyre were destined to render themselves deities. That is why he was penalized with mortality. That is what is written [concerning Ḥiram]: “You were in Eden, the Garden of God” (Ezekiel 28:13). Now, was Ḥiram actually in the Garden of Eden? This is a rhetorical question. Rather, He was saying to him: ‘It is you who caused the one in the Garden of Eden to die.’ Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Berekhya’s daughter, said in the name of Rabbi Berekhya: “You were a great cherub” (Ezekiel 28:14) – it is you [Ḥiram] who caused that cherub [Adam]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Adam is referred to as a cherub due to his lofty spiritual status.</i> to die. Rabbi Yonatan said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina.</i> If so,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">If the reason for Adam’s mortality is as you say.</i> let Him decree death for the wicked and not decree death for the righteous. The reason [He didn’t do this] is that it was so that the wicked should not feign repentance, so that the wicked should not say: ‘Do the righteous not live because they accumulate mitzvot and good deeds? We, too, will accumulate mitzvot and good deeds.’ The result would be acting [virtuously] for insincere motives. <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In explanation of Rabbi Meir’s statement that death is a good thing.</i> Why was death decreed for the wicked? The answer is that as long as the wicked are alive, they anger the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “You wearied the Lord with your words” (Malachi 2:17). But once they die, they stop angering the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “There anger has ceased for the wicked” (Job 3:17) – there they stop angering the Lord. And why was death decreed for the righteous? The answer is that as long as the righteous are alive, they engage in battle against their evil inclination, and when they die, they rest.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In Paradise.</i> That is what is written: “There rest those whose strength is sapped” (Job 3:17) – [those who say:] ‘We have toiled enough.’  <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The benefit of dying and going on to the Next World.</i> is to give these [the righteous] a double reward and to exact double retribution against those [the wicked]. It is to give reward to the righteous who were worthy of never tasting the taste of death. That is why, “therefore, they will inherit a double portion in their land” (Isaiah 61:7). And to exact retribution against the wicked, as the righteous were worthy of never tasting the taste of death, and it was only due to them [the wicked] that they accepted death upon themselves. They will therefore inherit double of what they have earned.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Double punishment. There are other versions that cite the verse: “Shatter them with double destruction” (Jeremiah 17:18).</i>
Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: “And behold it was very good” – and behold sleep is good. Is sleep, then, very good? This is a rhetorical question. Did we not learn: Wine and sleep are beneficial for them [the wicked] and beneficial for the whole world?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5:5.</i> However, as a result of a person sleeping a bit, he can get up and toil extensively in the Torah.
Rabbi Naḥman bar Shmuel bar Naḥman said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Naḥman: “Behold it was very good” – this is the good inclination; “and behold it was very good” – this is the evil inclination.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The addition of the word “and” is to introduce a second object.</i> Is the evil inclination, then, very good? This is a rhetorical question. Rather, were it not for the evil inclination, a man would never build a house, would never marry a wife, would never beget children, and would never engage in commerce. Likewise, Solomon says: “[And I have considered all toil and all excelling in work,] that it is each man’s envy of his counterpart” (Ecclesiastes 4:4).
Rav Huna said: “Behold it was very good” – this refers to experiencing good fortune; “and behold it was very good” – this refers to experiencing suffering. Is the experiencing of suffering, then, “very good”? This is a rhetorical question. It is, rather, that through it, people come to attain life in the World to Come. Likewise, Solomon says: “Rebukes of admonition is the way toward life” (Proverbs 6:23). You must say: Go out and see, which path is it that leads a person towards life in the World to Come? This is the experiencing of suffering.
Rabbi Ze’eira said: “Behold it was very good” – this is the Garden of Eden; “and behold it was very good” – this is Gehenna. Is Gehenna, then, very good? This is a rhetorical question. This is analogous to a king who had an orchard. He stationed laborers there and he built a storage house at its entrance. He said: ‘Anyone who performs successfully in the labor of the orchard, he may enter its treasury; anyone who does not perform successfully in the labor of the orchard, he may not enter its treasury.’ So, too, anyone who amasses mitzvot and good deeds, here is the Garden of Eden. Anyone who does not amass mitzvot and good deeds, here is Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Gehenna is a good thing in that it spurs man to act virtuously.</i>
Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: “Behold it was very good” – this is the angel of life; “and behold it was very good” – this is the angel of death. Is the angel of death, then, “very good”? This is a rhetorical question. Rather, it is analogous to a king who prepared a feast, invited the guests and brought before them a serving dish filled with all kinds of delicacies. He said: ‘Anyone who eats and blesses the king, let him eat and enjoy himself, but anyone who eats and does not bless the king, his head shall be severed with a sword.’ So, too, anyone who amasses mitzvot and good deeds, here is the angel of life, and anyone who does not amass mitzvot and good deeds, here is the angel of death.
Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said: “Behold it was very good [<i>tov me’od</i>]” – this is the [divine] attribute of benevolence [<i>midat tov</i>], “and behold it was very good” – this is the [divine] attribute of strict punishment. Is the attribute of strict punishment, then, “very good”? Rather, He works conscientiously on the punishment, in which manner to bring it.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">God makes sure to produce a punishment that corresponds to the person’s misdeed, so that he and others can understand what brought it about and improve their behavior accordingly.</i> Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Abba: All the [original divine] measures are now void,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">All the processes that God used in creating the world.</i> but the [principle of] measure for measure<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The principle that God grants reward and punishment in a manner that corresponds to a person’s acts.</i> has not been voided. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: From the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One blessed be He foresaw [the principle] that in accordance with the measure that a person metes out for others, so is it meted out for him. That is why the Sages said: “And behold it was very good” – this is the attribute of beneficence.
The Rabbis said it in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi, Rabbi Pinḥas, and Rabbi Ḥilkiya: “Very [<i>me’od</i>]”<i> </i>and “man [<i>adam</i>]”<i> </i>are identical; the letters of this word are the same as letters of that one. That is what is written: “God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good” – this refers to man.
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “Behold it was very good” – this is the kingdom of Heaven; “and behold it was very good” – this is the kingdom on earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In some editions, due to censorship: The kingdom of the Romans.</i> Is the kingdom on earth, then, “very good”?

Chapter 10

<b>“The heavens and the earth and their entire host were completed” (Genesis 2:1).</b> <br>“The heavens and the earth and their entire host were completed.” It is written: “I see an end to all great things, but Your commandments are exceedingly broad” (Psalms 119:96). Everything has boundaries, the heavens and earth have boundaries, with the exception of one matter that does not have boundaries. Which is that? That is the Torah, as it is stated: “Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea” (Job 11:9). Another interpretation: “I see an end to all great things” – this is the work of the creation of the heavens and the earth, as it is stated: “The heavens and the earth…were completed.”
Rabbi Ḥama began: “Remove the dross from silver [and a vessel will emerge for the smith] (Proverbs 25:4) – Rabbi Eliezer said in the name of Rabbi Yaakov: This is analogous to a bathtub that was filled with water, and there were two ornamental bowls in it. As long as it was full of water, the handiwork of the bowls was not visible. Once someone opened the drain and emptied the water from it, the handiwork of the bowls became visible. So, too, as long as the world was emptiness and disorder, the labor of the heavens and the earth was not visible. Once the emptiness and disorder was uprooted from the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Upon the completion of the process of creation.</i> the handiwork of the heavens and the earth became visible. “A vessel [<i>keli</i>] will emerge for the smith” (Proverbs 25:4) – they [the heavens and earth] became [finished] vessels. That is what is written: “The heavens and the earth and their entire host were completed [<i>vaykhulu</i>].”
How did the Holy One blessed be He create His world? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One blessed be He took two skeins, one of fire and one of snow, mixed them with one another, and from them the world was created. Rabbi Ḥanina said: Four, for the four directions of the world. Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Six, four for the four directions and one for above and one for below. Hadrian, may his bones be crushed, once asked Rabbi Yehoshua bar Ḥananya, saying to him: ‘How did the Holy One blessed be He create His world?’ He said to him in accordance with what Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said. He said to him: ‘Is it possible that it was so?’ This was a rhetorical question. He took him into a small house and said to him: ‘Extend your hand to east, west, north, and south.’ He said to him: ‘Such was the action done by the Holy One blessed be He.’
Rabbi Hoshaya said: Rabbi Afes expounded in Antioch: “<i>Vaykhulu</i>” is nothing other than an expression of a delivering a blow and an expression of destruction [<i>kelaya</i>]. This is analogous to a king who entered a province and the residents of the province lauded him. Their lauding pleased him, and he provided them with encouragement and incentives. Sometime later, they angered him, so he minimized encouragement and incentives for them. So, too, until Adam the first man sinned, the celestial bodies would move in a short path, and quickly. After he sinned, He diverted them into a roundabout path, and they went at a slow pace. There are celestial bodies that complete their circuits in twelve months, such as Mercury. And there are celestial objects that complete their circuit in thirty days, namely, the moon. And there are celestial objects that complete their circuits in twelve years, namely, Jupiter. And there are celestial objects that complete their circuits in thirty years, namely, Saturn. This is all besides Venus and Mars, which complete their circuit only in four hundred and eighty years. <The question arises: Venus traverses twelve constellations in ten months, each constellation in twenty-five days; Mars in a month and a half, and traverses twelve in one year and a half. How, then, does it say that Venus and Mars complete their circuit only after four hundred and eighty years? I encountered this difficulty; therefore, I raised a question).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is a gloss from an unknown student, which was mistakenly inserted into the Midrash text since the first printed edition.</i> <br>Rabbi Pinḥas taught in the name of Rabbi Ḥanan of Tzippori: Regarding white fig trees, their Sabbatical Year sanctity takes effect in the second year of the Sabbatical cycle, because they produce fruit after three years,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Sheviit</i> 5:1.

Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The heavens were perfected [<i>nishtakhlelu</i>] through [the addition of] the sun, moon, and constellations, and the earth was perfected through [the addition of] trees, vegetation, and the Garden of Eden. Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The creations were all made in generic form [<i>mekhulalim</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">When they were first created they were without their full shape and detail, and during the six days of creation they expanded and developed into their full form.</i> and they gradually expanded. <br>“And their entire host [<i>tzevaam</i>]” – Rabbi Elazar said: There are three kinds of <i>tzava</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The word is used in three different senses. The common denominator of them all is that they refer to things that come in abundance.</i> The <i>tzava</i> of the heavens and the earth, the <i>tzava</i> of the students, and the <i>tzava</i> of suffering. The <i>tzava</i> of the heavens and the earth, as it is stated: “The heavens and the earth and their entire host [<i>tzevaam</i>] were completed.” The <i>tzava</i> of the students, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “All the days of my teaching students [<i>tzeva’i</i>], I wait until my replacement comes” (Job 14:14) – until my replacement arises. The <i>tzava</i> of suffering, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Behold, there is suffering <i>[tzava]</i> for man upon earth” (Job 7:1). <br>[Another interpretation of this last verse:] All a person’s aspirations [<i>tzivion</i>] are only on the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For earthly matters, such as achieving wealth and comfort.</i> But of what benefit is it for him, since “his days are like the days of a hired laborer” (Job 7:1). <br>Naḥman son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: If one merits, <i>tzava<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A great deal of success.</i></i> will be his, but if not, the <i>tzava<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Great tragedy.</i></i> will be upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The word “upon” in Job 7:1 is written (<i>ketiv</i>) על, but pronounced (<i>keri</i>) עלי, allowing for two interpretations: Either the <i>tzava</i> is for the benefit of the man, or it overcomes him.</i> When one builds a building, if he is fortunate, the <i>tzava</i> is his. If he falls from it and dies, the <i>tzava</i> overcomes him. If one eats his bread and enjoys it, <i>tzava</i> is his. If it gets stuck in his throat and chokes him, the <i>tzava</i> overcomes him. And the Holy One blessed be He has appointed many kinds of <i>tzava </i>for man in order to collect His due – many bears, many lions, many snakes, many fiery serpents, many scorpions.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The lesson is that the pursuit of material gain may ultimately be detrimental to a person.</i> Moreover, “his days are like the days of a hired laborer.”

Will you establish its dominion [<i>mishtaro</i>] on earth?” (Job 38:33). It is an expression of being in charge [<i>shoter</i>]. “Will you tie the chains of the Pleiades, or untie the reins of Orion?” (Job 38:31) – Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and Rabbi Simon said: Pleiades renders fruits delicate and Orion draws it out from knot to knot.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It causes the fruits to grow to full size.</i> That is what is written: “Will you bring out the <i>Mazarot</i> in its season and guide Ursa with its sons?” (Job 38:32).

The Rabbis say: Even matters that you consider superfluous in the world, like flies, fleas, and gnats, they, too, are included in the creation of the world, and through all of them the Holy One blessed be He executes His missions – even by means of a serpent, even by means of a gnat, even by means of a frog. Rabbi Tanḥuma said it in the name of Rabbi Menaḥma, Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: Rabbi Aḥa would relate this incident: A certain man was standing on the river bank. He saw a frog carrying a scorpion and transporting it across the river.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The scorpion was sent to kill someone, and crossed the river in an unnatural manner to do so. </i> After it [the scorpion] performed its mission, it [the frog] took it back to its place. <br>Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanan of Tzippori: There was an incident involving a certain man who was standing to reap his crop in the Bei Tarfa valley. He saw a stalk of a certain herb, picked it, and crafted it into a wreath for his head. A serpent came and he struck it, killing it. Another man came and stood there to look at the snake. He said: ‘I wonder, who was it who killed this serpent?’ That man said: ‘I killed it.’ He lifted his eyes and saw the stalk of herb that had been crafted into a wreath on his head. He said: ‘Did you really kill it?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘Can you remove that herb from your head?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ Once he removed it he said to him: ‘Can you come over here and lift this serpent with this staff?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ When he approached that serpent, immediately his limbs fell.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The snake had been sent to kill the man. The herb, which apparently contained an antidote to snake venom, saved him from his fate, but eventually the mission was accomplished.</i>  <br>Rabbi Yanai was sitting and expounding at the entrance to his city. He saw a serpent slithering and approaching. When he chased it away from one side, it returned at the other side, and when he chased it away from that side, it returned from the other side. He said: This one is on his way to perform a mission. Thereafter, a sound was heard in the city: So-and-so son of so-and-so was bitten by a serpent and died. <br>Rabbi Elazar was sitting, paying a visit to the latrine. A Roman came and expelled him, entered in his place and sat himself down. He [Rabbi Elazar] said: This did not occur for naught. Immediately, a serpent emerged and struck him [the Roman], killing him. He applied to him the verse: “I placed a man [<i>adam</i>] in your stead” (Isaiah 43:4) – I placed Edom in your stead.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Romans were identified with the people of Edom.</i> <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar was standing and strolling along the shore of the Sea of Caesarea and saw a certain thighbone that was rolling along. He kept pushing it away out of sight, but it kept rolling back. He said: This one is prepared to perform a mission. Several days later, a certain courier passed by, and he stumbled on it and died. They went and examined him and found that he was carrying evil missives regarding the Jews of Caesarea. <br>The wicked Titus entered the Holy of Holies with a sword drawn in his hand and he cut the two curtains. Then he took two harlots and cohabited with them atop the altar. He emerged with his sword full of blood. Some say that it was blood of sacrifices, and some say it was the blood of the goat offered on Yom Kippur. He spoke out with blasphemy and sacrilege.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Saying that he had defeated God and this was His blood.</i> He took all the Temple vessels and wrapped them up in a big bundle.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Using the Temple curtain.</i> He again began to speak out with blasphemy and sacrilege against the most High, saying: ‘There is no comparison between one who wages war with the king in the wilderness and defeats him, and one who wages war with the king in his own palace and defeats him there.’ He went down to his ship. When he set sail, a large wave struck him in the sea. He said: ‘It appears that the God of this nation has power only in the water. He exacted retribution against the generation of Enosh only with water, He exacted retribution against the generation of the Flood only with water, He exacted retribution against Pharaoh and his army only with water. I, too, when I was in His House and His domain He was unable to stand up against me, and now He has confronted me here. He believes that He will kill me in the water.’ The Holy One blessed be He said [an oath] to him: ‘Wicked one, by your life, I will exact retribution from this wicked one [Titus] with a creature that is the smallest of all the creatures I created during the six days of Creation.’ Thereupon, the Holy One blessed be He signaled to the angel of the sea and it calmed from its raging.  <br>When he reached Rome, all the residents of Rome emerged and lauded him. When he ascended to Rome [the city], he entered the bathhouse. When he emerged, they poured him a vial of a post-bath elixir with wine to drink. A gnat entered into his nose and began to continuously gnaw at his brain, until it was as large as a two-pound fowl. He [Titus] issued a command, saying: ‘Open up the brain of this man<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Titus referred to himself in third person.</i> to ascertain through what instrument the God of the Jews has exacted retribution from this man.’ Thereupon, they called the surgeons, they opened up his brain and removed what was like a two-pound fowl. Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Yosei said: ‘I saw in Rome that [they placed] a weight of two pounds on one side [of a balance] and the bird-like growth [of Titus] on the other side, and they were equal in weight. They took it and placed it in a bowl. As it [the growth] withered, he [Titus] withered along with it. [When it returned to its natural size,] the gnat flew away and the soul of the evil Titus flew away [as well].’
<b>“God completed on the seventh day His labor that He had made; He rested on the seventh day from all His labor that He had made” (Genesis 2:2).</b> <br>“God completed on the seventh day” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei took me to a certain inn and said to me: ‘Here my father prayed the Shabbat [evening] prayer before Shabbat.’<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">On Friday afternoon.</i> Rabbi Yirmeya and Rabbi Aḥa say: Rabbi Yoḥanan raised it as a difficulty: ‘Did my father pray the Shabbat [evening] prayer here before Shabbat?’ he asked in bewilderment. But there was no need to raise a difficulty, as the donkey drivers had come up from Arav to Tzippori, and said: ‘Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa has already begun to observe Shabbat in his city.’ If you wish to raise a difficulty, raise it concerning this [version of the incident]: Rabbi Ḥanina said: Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei took me to a certain inn and said to me: ‘Did my father pray the post-Shabbat [evening] prayer here on Shabbat?’<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The difficulty is: How could he say the post-Shabbat prayer while it was still daytime?</i> Rabbi Abba said: ‘Concerning this as well there is no need to raise a difficulty, as Rabbi once was sitting and giving a lecture, and [afterwards] he said to Abba Yudan, his spokesman: Announce to the congregation that they should pray the weekday [evening] prayer now, though it is still daytime.’
Rabbi asked Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei, saying to him: ‘Did you hear from your father what is meant by: “God completed [<i>vayechal</i>] on the seventh day”? This is bewildering.’<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">God finished the Creation before the seventh day, not on the seventh day.</i> The explanation is that it is like someone who was banging with a hammer onto an anvil. He raised it while it was still day and lowered it after nightfall.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The act was begun before nightfall, so it is counted as being done during the day.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: A mortal human being who does not know [with certainty] his times, his minutes, and his hours, he must add from the profane to the sacred.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">A mortal man cannot determine the exact moment when Shabbat begins, so he must take away some of the weekday hours of Friday and add it on to Shabbat.</i> But the Holy One blessed be He, who knows [with certainty] his minutes, his times, and his hours, entered into it [Shabbat] like a hairbreadth.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">God performed labor at a time that appeared to mortal man as though it was already the seventh day, although it was, in fact, not yet Shabbat.</i> <br>Geniva and the Rabbis, Geniva said: This is analogous to a king who made himself a wedding canopy, painted it and embossed it. What was it lacking? A bride [<i>kalla</i>] to enter it. So, too, what was the world lacking? Shabbat.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">God did create something on the seventh day – namely, Shabbat itself.</i> The Rabbis say: This is analogous to a king for whom they crafted a signet ring. What was lacking? The seal. So, too, what was the world lacking? Shabbat.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">And Shabbat is a sign, like a signet, between God and Israel (Exodus 31:17).</i> <br>This is one of the matters that they changed for King Ptolemy<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This was when he gathered seventy Sages to translate the Torah into Greek – the Septuagint (see <i>Megilla </i>9a).

Woe to the world from its judgments.’ <br>“His labor” – did Rabbi Berekhya not say this in the name of Rabbi Simon: It was not with toil and not with exertion that the Holy One blessed be He created His world.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">But, “by the word of the Lord the heavens were made” (Psalms 33:6).</i> And you say “from all His labor”? This is bewildering. The explanation is that it is to exact retribution against the wicked, who demolish the world [as if it were] all created with toil and with exertion, and to grant a reward to the righteous, who sustain the world [as if it were] all created with toil and with exertion.  <br>What was created on it [Shabbat] after He rested [from creating the world]? Tranquility, satisfaction, calm, and quiet. <br>Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Nehorai: As long as the hands of their Maker were touching them, they [the creations] would continuously expand. When the hands of their Maker let go of them, they were granted rest. “He rested [<i>Vayanaḥ</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This word can also mean, “He let go.”</i> [on the seventh day]” (Exodus 20:11) – He let go of His world on the seventh day. <br>Rabbi Abba said: A mortal [king], when he grants furlough [to his soldiers], he does not give them gratuities, and when he gives them gratuities, he does not grant them furlough. But the Holy One blessed be He both granted a furlough and gave gratuities: “He rested [on the seventh day from all His labor that He had made]…and God blessed [the seventh day]” (Genesis 2:2–3).

Chapter 11

<b>“God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on it He rested from all His labor that God created to make” (Genesis 2:3).</b> <br>“God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it” – it is written: “The blessing of the Lord, it will enrich, without adding toil with it” (Proverbs 10:22). “The blessing of the Lord, it will enrich” – this is Shabbat, as it is stated: “God blessed the seventh day.” “Without adding toil [<i>etzev</i>] with it” – this is mourning, just as it says: “The king is in grief [<i>ne’etzav</i>] over his son” (II Samuel 19:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mourning the dead is not observed on Shabbat.</i>
“God blessed the seventh day [and sanctified it]” – Rabbi Yishmael said: He blessed it with manna and He sanctified it with manna. He blessed it with manna in that all the days of the week one <i>omer </i>[of manna] would fall, while on the day before Shabbat two <i>omers</i> would fall.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">An extra <i>omer</i> for Shabbat.</i> He sanctified it with manna, as it did not fall on it [on Shabbat] at all.

One time I kindled a candle on Shabbat eve, and I came and found it burning at the conclusion of Shabbat, and nothing [of the oil] was diminished. <br>He blessed it with the radiance of a person’s face, He sanctified it with the radiance of a person’s face. The radiance of a person’s face all the days of the week is not comparable to the way it is on Shabbat. <br>He blessed it with the lights.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The primordial light of creation, which was hidden away because of Adam’s sin.</i> Rabbi Shimon bar Yehuda of Kefar Akko says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Even though the lights were cursed on the day before Shabbat,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When Adam sinned.</i> they were not stricken until the conclusion of Shabbat. This is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, and not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ami, as Rabbi Ami said: Adam the first man, his glory<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The primordial light.</i> did not spend the night with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It was abolished on the day of his creation, before Shabbat.</i> What is the source? “Man [<i>adam</i>] will not go to rest in his splendor; he is like the beasts that perish” (Psalms 49:13). The Rabbis say: His glory did spend the night with him, and only at the conclusion of Shabbat was his radiance taken from him, as He expelled him from the Garden of Eden. That is what is written: “You alter his countenance and send him away” (Job 14:20). <br>When the sun set on Shabbat eve, the Holy One blessed be He sought to put away the [primordial] light, but He accorded honor to Shabbat. That is what is written: “God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it” – He blessed it with light. When the sun set on Shabbat eve the [primordial] light continued to function.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even at night.</i> Everyone began praising [God]; that is what is written: “Under all the heavens they sing His praises,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets <i>yishrehu</i> as being related to <i>shira</i>, song.</i> and His light is to the ends of the earth” (Job 37:3). Why was this?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Why is it that “under all the heavens they sing His praises”?</i> Because “His light is to the ends of the earth.”  <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: By the light that the Holy One blessed be He created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When the Holy One blessed be He looked at the people of the generation of the Flood and the people of the generation of the Dispersion, whose actions were to be corrupt, He arose and hid it away and designated it for the righteous in the future. From where is it derived that He hid it away? It is as it is stated: “Their light will be withheld from the wicked, and the upraised arm will be broken” (Job 38:15). And from where is it derived that He designated it for the righteous in the future? It is as it is stated: “But the path of the righteous is like a dawning light, growing brighter until the day is established” (Proverbs 4:18). <br>Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ze’eira: That [primordial] light functioned for thirty-six hours – twelve on the day before Shabbat, twelve on the night of Shabbat, and twelve on Shabbat. As the sun set at the conclusion of Shabbat, darkness began approaching, and Adam the first man became afraid, as it is stated: “And I said that darkness will envelop me [<i>yeshufeni</i>]; night for me is light,” (Psalms 139:11) – that one [the serpent] in whose regard it is written: “He will strike you [<i>yeshufekha</i>] with his head, and you will strike him [<i>teshufenu</i>] with your heel” (Genesis 3:15), is now coming to confront me.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The serpent represents death, as it was through its evil machinations that Adam sinned and was condemned to death.</i> What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He prepared for him two flint stones and he struck them one against the other. Light emerged from them and he recited a blessing over it. That is what is written: “Night for me is light.” What blessing did he recite over it? [Blessed be God] Who creates the lights of fire. This is in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: Why does one recite a blessing over light at the conclusion of Shabbat? It is because that time was the beginning of its creation. Rav Huna in the name of Rav and Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One recites a blessing over it [light] at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, as well, because fire rested all that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to make a fire all day on Yom Kippur.</i>
He blessed it due to the expenditure.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He gave Shabbat a blessing that people should not suffer a long-term financial loss when spending money to honor it.</i> Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina: Every day on which there is reduction [among the creations of that day], blessing is written in its regard, and in fact it lacks nothing.

There was a certain child sitting in the middle of the tabletop and proclaiming and saying: “The earth and all that it holds are the Lord’s, the world and all its inhabitants” (Psalms 24:1). And why did he go to such lengths?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Why was the child placed there in order to proclaim this?</i> It was so the host should not become haughty [from all his wealth].

There was a certain tailor there and he went [to the market] to purchase a fish. It happened that he and the child [servant] of the governor were vying for it. This one would offer a higher price and the other one would offer a still higher price, until it reached twelve dinars, and the tailor purchased it. At dinnertime, the governor said to the child: ‘Why did you not bring me a fish?’ He said to him: ‘My master, I will not conceal it from you, I went [to the market] and there was only one fish there and it happened that I and a certain Jew were vying for it. He offered a higher price and I offered a higher price until it reached twelve dinars. Would you have wanted me to bring you a fish for twelve dinars?’ he asked rhetorically. He said to him: ‘Who is it [who bought the fish]?’ He said to him: ‘A man named such-and-such.’ He sent for him and he came before him. He said to him: ‘What did you see, Jewish tailor, that led you to eat a fish that cost twelve dinars?’ He said to him: ‘My master, we have one day [each year] that atones for us for all the sins we have performed all the days of the year. When it arrives, should we not accord it honor?’ He said to him: ‘Because you adduced a justification for your position, you are exempt [from punishment].’ How did the Holy One blessed be He reward him? He went and cut it open and He brought it about for him that there was a fine gem inside it, and he supported himself from it all his days.

He was brought up all the days of the week, but on Shabbat he could not be brought up. On Sunday he brought him up again. He said to him in bewilderment: ‘Since you died, have you become a Jew? Why were you brought up all the days of the week, but on Shabbat you could not be brought up?’ He said to him: ‘Anyone who does not observe Shabbat willingly in your place, will observe it here perforce.’ He said to him: ‘Do you have labor there for which you exert yourselves all the days of the week, that you can experience rest on Shabbat?’ He said to him: ‘All the days of the week we are punished, but on Shabbat we rest.’ <br>He [Tinneus Rufus] returned to Rabbi Akiva and said to him: ‘If it is as you say, that the Holy One blessed be He honors the Shabbat, let him not make the wind blow [on Shabbat], let him not make rain fall, let him not allow grass to grow.’ He said to him: ‘May the spirit of that man<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Tinneus Rufus.</i> depart from him. I will tell you a parable: [It is analogous to] two people who resided in the same courtyard. If one does not contribute to the <i>eruv</i> and the other one contributes to the <i>eruv</i>, is it, perhaps, permitted to transport items in the courtyard? However, if one person resides in a courtyard alone, it is permitted for him [to transport items] in the entire courtyard. Here, too, the Holy One blessed be He, because there is no other power that co-exists with Him, and the entire world is His, it is permitted for Him [to transport items] throughout the entire world. Additionally, those who partook of the manna can attest to it,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">That Shabbat is indeed different from the other days of the week.</i> as all the days of the week it would fall, but on Shabbat it did not fall.’
A certain philosopher once asked Rabbi Hoshaya, saying to him: ‘If circumcision is so dear to Him [God], why was it not given to Adam the first man?’<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The insinuation of his question was that circumcision is not a divine command, but rather a form of purposeless mutilation.</i> He said to him: ‘Why does this man [the philosopher] shave the corner of [the hair on] his head but leave the corner of his beard?’ He replied: ‘It is because this [the head hair] grew with him in his period of foolishness.’<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In his childhood.</i> He said to him: ‘If so, he should put out his eye, sever his hands, and break his legs, because they too grew with him in his period of foolishness.’ He said to him: ‘Have we come to such [frivolous] arguments?’ This was a rhetorical question. He said to him: ‘It is not possible for me to dismiss you with no response at all. The explanation is that everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires some action [to bring it to its perfected state], e.g., mustard requires sweetening, lupines require sweetening, wheat requires grinding. And even man needs to be perfected.’
Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta: Abraham, in whose regard observance of Shabbat is not mentioned, inherited the world with a limited measure, as it is stated: “Arise, walk about in the land to its length and to its breadth, [as to you I will give it]” (Genesis 13:17). But Jacob, in whose regard observance of Shabbat is mentioned, as it is stated: “He encamped before the city” (Genesis 33:18) – he entered with the dimming of the sun and established Shabbat boundaries [for his camp] while it was still day – [he] inherited the world with no limited measure, as it is stated: “Your descendants will be as the dust of the earth, [and you shall spread out to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south]” (Genesis 28:14).
Another interpretation: Why did He bless it [Shabbat]? Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Dostai and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Dostai say: It is because it does not have a partner. Sunday has Monday [as its partner], Tuesday has Wednesday, Thursday has Shabbat eve. But Shabbat has no partner.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore it required God’s blessing.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It [the blessing of Shabbat] is in that it cannot be postponed.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It always occurs every seventh day.</i> Festivals may be postponed,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The holy days are observed on particular dates in particular months, so their time is determined when the New Year and New Months are declared by the religious court. These courts are authorized to postpone these declarations in various circumstances.</i> Yom Kippur may be postponed, but Shabbat cannot be postponed. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: Shabbat said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, all of them [the other days] have partners, but I do not have a partner.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘The congregation of Israel is your partner.’ When Israel stood before Mount Sinai, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Remember the matter that I said to Shabbat: The congregation of Israel is your partner.’ That is the meaning of the statement in the Ten Commandments: “Remember the Shabbat day to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8).
Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: The Holy One blessed be He created three creations on each day. On the first day He created the heavens, the earth, and light; on the second day, the firmament, Gehenna, and angels; on the third day, trees, grasses, and the Garden of Eden; on the fourth day, the sun, the moon, and the constellations; on the fifth day, birds, fish, and Leviathan; on the sixth day, Adam, Eve, and crawling creatures. Rabbi Pinḥas said: On the sixth day, He created six things: Adam, Eve, crawling creatures, animals, beasts, and demons. Rabbi Benaya said: “That God created and made” is not written here, but rather, “that God created to make” – everything that the Holy One blessed be He was going to create on the seventh day, He created them early, on the sixth day.
Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya: Although it says: “Because on it He rested from all His labor,” from the labor of creating His world He rested,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">“Because on it He rested from all His labor that God created” implies that it was only from His own labor that He rested, but there were other types of labor that continued.</i> but he did not rest from the labor of the wicked nor from the labor of the righteous. Rather, he performs actions with these and with those. He shows to these the essence of what is their fate and to those the essence of their fate.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">He punishes the wicked and rewards the righteous, all in accordance with what has been determined by their deeds. This kind of “labor” never ceased.</i> From where is it derived that the punishment of the wicked is called labor? It is as it is stated: “The Lord opened His armory and took out the weapons of His fury, for it is labor [for the Lord]” (Jeremiah 50:25). And from where is it derived that the reward of the righteous is called labor? It is as it is stated: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You, which You have fashioned<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The expression <i>”</i>fashioning<i>” </i> is associated with labor.</i> for those taking refuge in You, in the presence of people” (Psalms 31:20).

Chapter 12

<b>“These are the outgrowths of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens” (Genesis 2:4).</b> <br>“These are the outgrowths [<i>toledot</i>] of the heavens and of the earth when they were created” – it is written: “Behold, these are but the edges of His ways…” (Job 26:14). Rav Huna said: All the things that you see are just the edges of the ways of the Holy One blessed be He. “Behold, these are but the edges of His ways, and how a trace is heard about Him; who can investigate the thunder of His might?” (Job 26:14). Rav Huna said: Thunder, when it emerges in its full force, no creature can understand it. “Who has investigated?” is not written, but rather, “who can investigate?” Clever people may have vague knowledge or ideas about it, [but even they cannot understand it fully]. Rav Huna said: If you are unable to understand [even] the workings of thunder, is it not all the more so for the workings of the [whole] world? That is a rhetorical question.  <br>If<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is an exposition on the verse “What is man, that he should come along after the King, after they have already done something?” (Ecclesiastes 2:12).

That is a rhetorical question.’ <br>Rav Naḥman said: This<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is an exposition on the first half of the aforementioned verse: “I devoted myself to acquire wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 2:12). After Solomon acquired his wisdom, others were able to take advantage of it as well.</i> is analogous to a thicket of reeds into which no person could enter, as anyone who entered into it would lose his way. What did one clever person do? He continuously cut down [reeds] and entered further and further into the thicket. He entered via the clearing and exited via the clearing. Everyone then began entering and exiting via the clearing. Rav Naḥman said differently: This is analogous to a great palace that had many entrances. Everyone who entered it would lose his way. What did one clever person do? He took a spool of string and tied it [on one end] opposite the entrance and he entered by means of the spool<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Unwinding the string as he went along.</i> and exited by means of the spool. Everyone then began entering and exiting by means of the spool.  <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: This is analogous to a flesh-and-blood king who built a palace. People entered into it and said: If the pillars were taller it would be nicer, if the walls were higher it would be nicer, if the ceiling were higher it would be nicer. But did a person ever come and say: If I had three eyes, if I had three legs, it would be better for me? That is a rhetorical question. <br>“After He has already done” is not written, but rather, “after they have already done” (Ecclesiastes 2:12). The King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, and His court conferred, as it were, over each and every limb of yours, and established it at its proper configuration, as it is stated: “Will you repay the Lord this, crude and unwise people? Is He not your father, your redeemer? He made you, and He established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). <br>Rabbi Levi bar Ḥaita said: When a flesh-and-blood king builds a palace, if he would place its drain pipe at its entrance it would not be becoming. But the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, created man and placed his drain pipe at his entrance,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the nose, which is right at the front of one’s face.</i> and it is becoming, and it is [in fact] a person’s glory. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: It is written: “The Lord God formed the man” (Genesis 2:7). Why, then, does the verse state [again]: “Whom He had formed” (Genesis 2:8)? The Holy One blessed be He was taking pride in His world, as it were, saying: ‘See the creation that I created and the form that I formed.’ <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: It is written: “These are the outgrowths of the heavens and of the earth when they were created” – their Creator praises them, who can disparage them? Their Creator lauds them, who will find fault with them? Rather, they are beautiful and praiseworthy, as it is stated: “These are the outgrowths of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.”
Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “When they were created [<i>behibare’am</i>]” – with <i>heh</i> [<i>beheh</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Effortlessly, with the ease it takes to pronounce the letter <i>heh </i>(see section 10).</i> He created them [<i>bera’am</i>]. “My hand made all these [<i>eleh</i>], and all these came into being, the utterance of the Lord, but to this I will look; to the poor and the depressed and those fervent for My word” (Isaiah 66:2) – Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Simon: It was not with exertion and not with toil that the Holy One blessed be He created the world, as it is stated: “My hand made all these, [and all these came into being, the utterance of the Lord].”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The implication of this verse is that the world was created through the mere utterance of the Lord.</i> <br>Rabbi Yudan said: By the merit of the Torah, as it is stated: “These [<i>eleh</i>] are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the Lord gave between Him and the children of Israel at Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses” (Leviticus 26:46). Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya says: By the merit of the tribes, as it is stated: “These [<i>eleh</i>] are the names” (Exodus 1:1). And it is stated: “And all these [<i>eleh</i>] came into being.”
“These are [<i>eleh</i>] the outgrowths of the heavens [when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens]…” – Rabbi Abahu said: Everywhere <i>eleh </i>is stated, it rejects what preceded it; <i>ve’eleh</i> adds to what preceded it. Here, where it says <i>eleh</i>, it excludes what preceded it. What, then, does it exclude? Emptiness, disorder, and darkness.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The state that preceded the creation of the earth and the heavens (Genesis 1:2).</i>
Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: “The heavens and the earth…were completed” (Genesis 2:1) – at their designated time. “And their entire host” (Genesis 2:1) – at their designated time.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The heavens and the earth on the one hand, and their hosts on the other hand, were created on separate days.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: But is it not written: “These are the outgrowths of the heavens and of the earth when they were created [on the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens]” – which teaches that on the same day they were created they produced their outgrowths? He said to him: But is it not written: “It was evening, it was morning, one day…a second day…a third day…a fourth day…a fifth day…a sixth day”?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">With different items created on each day.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: They are like people picking figs; each one of them appears at its time.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">All the buds of the figs are present at the beginning of the season, but they ripen gradually, each one in its time. So, too, the outgrowths of the heavens and the earth were present in an incipient form from the beginning, and grew into their final form during the subsequent days.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said in support of Rabbi Neḥemya’s teaching: “The earth brought forth [vegetation]” (Genesis 1:12) – [“bringing forth” indicating] something that was already stored inside it.
Rabbi Neḥemya of Kefar Siḥon said: “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, [the sea]…” (Exodus 20:11). The three items are the essential basis of the creation of the world, and each one waited three days and then produced three products: The earth [was created] on the first day, in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 1:15.</i> and it waited three days, the first and second and third, and then [on day three] produced three products – trees, vegetation, and the Garden of Eden. The firmament [was created] on the second day, waited three days, the second and third and fourth, and then [on day four] produced three products – the sun, the moon, and the constellations. Water [was created] on the third day, waited three days, the third and fourth and fifth, and then [on day five] produced three products – birds, fish, and Leviathan. <br>Rabbi Azarya did not say thus, but rather, “on the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens” – there were [only these] two items that were the essential basis of the creation of the world, and each waited three days and their labor was completed on the fourth. The heavens [were created] on the first day, in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 1:15.</i> they waited three days, the first and second and third, and then their labor was completed on the fourth day. What was the completion of their labor? The celestial lights. The earth [was created] on the third day: “The earth brought forth [vegetation, etc.]” (Genesis 1:12), [the vegetation] being the essential element of its creation. It waited three days, the third and fourth and fifth, and its labor was completed on the sixth. What was the completion of its labor? It is man, as it is stated: “I made the earth and created man upon it” (Isaiah 45:12).
The outgrowths [<i>toledot</i>]”<i> </i>– Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: All <i>toledot</i> that are stated in the Torah are written defectively<sup class=footnote-marker">388</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Toledot</i> may be written in full form, with two <i>vavs</i>, but usually it is written missing one or both of the <i>vavs</i>.</i> except for two: “These are the offspring [<i>toledot</i>] of Peretz…” (Ruth 4:18), and this one. Why are those [others] defective?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Specifically, “This is the book of the offspring [<i>toledot</i>] of Adam” (Genesis 5:1), where <i>toledot</i> is missing one <i>vav</i>.</i> Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Avin: They are corresponding to the six things that were taken away from Adam the first man [after he sinned].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The numerical value of <i>vav</i> is six.</i> They are: His radiance, his [eternal] life, his stature, the [extraordinary] produce of the earth, the [extraordinary] fruit of the tree, and the lights. His radiance, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “You alter his countenance and send him away” (Job 14:20). His life, from where is it derived? “For you are dust, [and to dust shall you return]” (Genesis 3:19). His stature, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The man and his wife hid” (Genesis 3:8). Rabbi Abahu said: At that moment, the stature of Adam the first man was reduced and [he] became a [mere] hundred cubits. The produce of the earth and the fruit of the tree, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Cursed is the ground on your account” (Genesis 3:17).  <br>As for the lights, Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi Yehuda of Kefar Akko said in the name of Rabbi Meir: Although the lights were cursed on the day before Shabbat,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">When Adam sinned.</i> they were stricken only at the conclusion of Shabbat. This is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis and not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, as Rabbi Yosei said: Adam the first man, his glory did not spend the night with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It was removed from him on the day of his creation, before Shabbat.</i> What is his source? “Man [<i>adam</i>] will not go to rest in his splendor…” (Psalms 49:13). The Rabbis say: [His glory did spend the night with him; ] only at the conclusion of Shabbat was his radiance taken from him as He expelled him from the Garden of Eden. That is what is written: “He banished the man” (Genesis 3:24), and it is written: “You alter his countenance and send him away” (Job 14:20).  <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: By the light with which the world was created, Adam the first man could look out and see from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One blessed be He looked ahead at the actions of the generation of Enosh, the actions of the generation of the Flood, and the actions of the generation of the Dispersion, [and saw] that they were corrupt, He arose and hid it away from them, as it is stated: “Their light will be withheld from the wicked” (Job 38:15). Why did He hide it away? The explanation is that he hid it away for the righteous in the future, as it is stated: “God saw that it [light] was good [<i>tov</i>]” (Genesis 1:4). <i>Tov</i> is nothing other than the righteous, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous one that he is good [<i>tov</i>]” (Isaiah 3:10). From where is it derived that He hid it away for the righteous? It is as it is stated: “But the path of the righteous is like a dawning light” (Proverbs 4:18). When he saw that the light was hidden away for the righteous, He rejoiced, as it is stated: “At the light of the righteous He will rejoice” (Proverbs 13:9). <br>Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Gezeira: That [primordial] light functioned for thirty-six hours – twelve on the day before Shabbat, twelve on the night of Shabbat, and twelve on Shabbat [day]. When Adam the first man sinned, He sought to hide it away [immediately], but He accorded deference to Shabbat, as it is stated: “God blessed the seventh day” (Genesis 2:3). With what did He bless it? It was with light. When the sun set on Shabbat eve the light continued to function. Everyone began praising the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “Under all the heavens they sing His praises” (Job 37:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets <i>yishrehu</i> as being related to <i>shira</i>, song.</i> Why? It is because “His light is to the ends of the earth” (Job 37:3). That light illuminated all day and all night.  <br>As the sun set at the conclusion of Shabbat, darkness began approaching, and at that time Adam the first man became afraid. He said: ‘Is it possible that the one [the serpent] in whose regard it is written: “He will strike you [<i>yeshufekha</i>] with his head, and you will strike him [<i>teshufenu</i>] with your heel” (Genesis 3:15), is now coming to confront me,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The serpent represents death, as it was through its evil machinations that Adam sinned and was condemned to death.</i> as it is stated: “And I said that darkness will envelop me [<i>yeshufeni</i>]”?’ (Psalms 139:11). He said this with bewilderment. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He prepared for him two flint stones, and he struck them one against the other. Light emerged from them and he recited a blessing over it. That is what is written: “Night, for me, is light” (Psalms 139:11). This is in accordance with the opinion of what was taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael: Why does one recite at the conclusion of Shabbat the blessing over light: ‘[Blessed be God] Who creates the lights of fire?’ It is because that time was the beginning of its creation. Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Aivu in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One recites a blessing over it [light] at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, as well, because fire rested on that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden to make a fire all day on Yom Kippur.</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: Although the [six] items were created in their complete form,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from the fact that <i>toledot </i>here (Genesis 2:4) is written complete, with both <i>vavs</i>.</i> when Adam the first man sinned they were ruined, and they will not be restored to their completeness until the descendant of Peretz [the Messiah] comes, as it is stated: “These are the offspring [<i>toledot</i>]<i> </i>of Peretz” (Ruth 4:18) – in its complete form,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">With both <i>vavs</i>.</i> for the six things [taken away from Adam] that will be restored: His radiance, his [eternal] life, his stature, the produce of the earth, the fruit of the tree, and the lights. His radiance, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “May all those who love Him be like the sun coming out in its might” (Judges 5:31). His [eternal] life, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For like the days of a tree will be the days of My people…” (Isaiah 65:22), and it is taught: Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “Tree” is nothing other than Torah, as it says: “It is a tree of life for those who grasp it” (Proverbs 3:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">“Like the days of a tree” means like the days of the Torah, meaning forever.</i> His stature, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “I caused you to walk upright [<i>komemiyut</i>]” (Leviticus 26:13).  <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: With upright stature and not in fear of any creature. Rabbi Yudan said: [Their stature will be] one hundred cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Komemiyut</i> is interpreted as <i>koma meyot</i> – stature of hundreds.</i> like Adam the first man. Rabbi Shimon said: Two hundred cubits.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Because <i>meyot</i> (hundreds) is in plural.</i> Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon said: Three hundred: <i>Koma </i>refers to one hundred,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">As that was the stature (<i>koma</i>) of Adam.</i> and <i>meyot</i> – refers to [another] two hundred. Rabbi Abahu said: Nine hundred cubits. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Dosa: Rabbi Abahu’s source is from here: “For like the days of a tree will be the days of My people” – like a sycamore that grows in the ground for six hundred years. An offspring emerges from its mother’s womb a bit more than a cubit long.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">And by the end of the first year after conception (when the baby is three months old), it reaches a length of one-and-a-half cubits. </i> Go out and calculate one-and-a-half cubits per year,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Since man’s growth is compared to the growth of a sycamore, that means he will grow at a constant rate for six hundred years.</i> that is nine hundred cubits.  <br>The produce of the earth, the fruit of the tree, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For the seed is of peace: The vine will yield its fruit, [and the land will yield its produce]” (Zechariah 8:12). The lights, from where is it derived? It is as it is written: “The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun [and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, like the light of the seven days]” (Isaiah 30:26).
Everything is associated with offspring [<i>toladot</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">They are involved in the process of producing offspring, or they themselves are considered offspring.</i> The heavens and the earth have <i>toladot</i>, as it is stated: “These are the outgrowths [<i>toledot</i>] of the heavens and of the earth when they were created.” Mountains are called <i>toladot</i>, as it is stated: “Before the mountains were born…” (Psalms 90:2). Rain is called <i>toladot</i>, as it is stated: “Does rain have a father?” (Job 38:28). Dew is called <i>toladot</i>, as it is stated: “And who begot the drops [<i>eglei</i>] of dew?” (Job 38:28). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: These [<i>eglai</i>] are gem-like drops of dew.  <br>It was taught: Anything that is associated with offspring dies and decomposes, is created but does not create. Anything that is not associated with offspring does not die, does not decompose, and creates but is not created. Rabbi Azarya stated: This [latter category] was stated [only] regarding the One above.
Everything that you see is an outgrowth of either the heavens or the earth, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). On the second day, He created things out of the heavenly realm: “God said: Let there be a firmament” (Genesis 1:6). On the third day, He created things out of the earthly realm: “God said: Let the earth sprout grass” (Genesis 1:11). On the fourth day, He created things out of the heavenly realm: “God said: Let there be lights” (Genesis 1:14). On the fifth day, He created things out of the earthly realm: “God said: Let the water swarm” (Genesis 1:20). On the sixth day, He came to create man. He said: ‘If I create him from the heavenly realm, the heavenly will outnumber the earthly by one creation and there will not be peace [equilibrium] in the world. If I create him from the earthly realm, the earthly will outnumber the heavenly by one creation and there will not be peace in the world. Rather, I will create him from both the heavenly and the earthly realms for the sake of peace.’ That is what is written: “And the Lord God created man…” (Genesis 2:7) – “Out of dust from the ground” (Genesis 2:7), from the earthly, “and He blew into his nostrils a living spirit” (Genesis 2:7), from the heavenly. This is as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “Dominion and fear are with Him; He makes peace in His heights” (Job 25:2). “Dominion” – this is Gabriel; “and fear” – this is Mikhael.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The angels Mikhael and Gabriel represent opposite spiritual forces, and God creates a balance (“peace”) between them, as he did with all of creation.</i>
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: “When they were created [<i>behibare’am</i>]” – <i>be’Avraham<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Behibare’am </i> and <i> be’Avraham</i> are spelled with the same letters.</i></i> – due to the merit of Abraham. Rabbi Azarya said regarding this statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: “You alone are the Lord; You made [the heavens, the heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and everything that is on it, the seas] and everything that is in them” (Nehemiah 9:6). And for what purpose was all this effort undertaken? It is for: “You are the Lord, the God who chose Abram, and took him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, and set his name as Abraham” (Nehemiah 9:7).  <br>Rabbi Yudan said: “The ibex are in the high mountains” is not written here, but rather, “the high mountains are for the ibex” (Psalms 104:18). Why were the high mountains created? For the ibex. The ibex is weak and fears wild beasts, but when it seeks to drink, the Holy One blessed be He introduces a manic spirit into it and it shakes its horns back and forth, producing noise, and it [the wild beast] flees. “The crag is a shelter for the hyrax” (Psalms 104:18) – the hyrax takes shelter under the crag from the bird of prey when it flies over so that it will not prey on it. If the Holy One blessed be He took into account this impure being when creating His world, would he not do all the more so for the merit of Abraham? That is a rhetorical question.
“<i>Behibare’am</i>” – Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <i>Behibare’am</i> – with a <i>heh</i> [<i>beheh</i>] He created them [<i>bera’am</i>]. Just as with <i>heh</i>, though all the other letters employ the tongue this one does not employ the tongue,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In order to pronounce the <i>heh</i> one need not use the tongue or any of the other parts of the mouth, e.g., the lips, the throat, the roof of the mouth, etc.</i> so, too, with no exertion or toil, the Holy One blessed be He created His world. It was, rather, “By the word of the Lord” (Psalms 33:6), and immediately “the heavens were made” (Psalms 33:6).  <br>Rabbi Yuda Nesia asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Because I have heard about you that you are a master of <i>aggada</i>, [I ask you]: What is it that is written: “Praise Him who rides in the highest heavens, by His name the Lord [<i>beyah shemo</i>]…”? (Psalms 68:5). He said to him: There is no place that does not have a person appointed to address its grievances (<i>biya</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Later editions have בית instead of בֶּיָּה.</i> A commissioner in the province is appointed to address grievances brought to him, a governor of the province is appointed to address grievances brought to him. So, who is appointed to address the grievances of the world? It is the Holy One blessed be He <i>beyah shemo</i> – over the grievances [<i>biya</i>] of His world. <br>He said to him: Woe to us for those [scholars] who have perished and are no longer to be found. I once asked Rabbi Elazar [to interpret this verse], and he did not say as you said. Rather, [he said:] “For <i>beyah Hashem</i> is the Rock [<i>tzur</i>] of the world [<i>olamim</i>]” (Isaiah 26:4) – with [these] two letters,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beyah</i> is interpreted to mean “by <i>yod </i>and<i> heh</i>.”</i> the Holy One blessed be He created<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Tzur (“Rock”) is interpreted as if pronounced <i>tzar</i>, “He fashioned.”</i> His world.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">He created two worlds, as the word <i>olamim </i>is plural.</i> We do not know whether this world was created with <i>heh </i> and the World to Come with <i>yod, </i>or whether this world was created with<i> yod</i> and the World to Come was created with <i>heh</i>. But from what Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <i>Behibare’am</i> – with a <i>heh</i> [<i>beheh</i>] He created them [<i>bera’am</i>], we see that it is this world that was created with <i>heh</i>. Just as <i>heh </i>is closed on all its sides, but open at the bottom, that is an allusion to the fact that all the dead descend to the netherworld. Its protrusion at the top is an allusion that they are destined to ascend from there. The window on its side is an allusion to the penitents.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Penitence provides an escape from man’s sentence to the netherworld.</i> The World to Come was created with a <i>yod</i>. Just as the <i>yod</i> has a bent stature, so, too, the wicked have bent statures and their faces are blackened in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Like a <i>yod</i>, which looks like a plain blotch of ink.</i> That is what is written: “The loftiness of humanity will be bowed and the haughtiness of men will be brought down and the Lord alone will be exalted on that day” (Isaiah 2:17). And it says: “And the false gods will entirely vanish” (Isaiah 2:18). <br>“When they were created”<i> </i>– Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: With no exertion or toil the Holy One blessed be He created His world.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">“When they were created,” in the passive voice, suggests that the world came about without toil, spontaneously.</i> It was, rather, “By the word of the Lord,” and immediately “the heavens were made” (Psalm 33:6). This is analogous to a king who rebuked his slave, and he stood there astounded.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Unable to move.</i> So, “The pillars of heaven sag, astounded at His rebuke” (Job 26:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The final form of the heavens was achieved through God’s mere rebuke, without toil.</i>
Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer says: Everything that is in the heavens is created out of the heavens; everything that is on earth is created out of the earth. He derives it from here: “Praise the Lord from the heavens [Praise Him all His angels…Praise Him sun and moon]…” (Psalms 148:1–3); “praise the Lord from the earth [all great sea creatures…mountains and all hills]…” (Psalms 148:7–9).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">All the objects in the heavens are listed as products of heaven, and all the objects on earth are listed as products of the earth. </i> Rabbi Yehoshua says: Everything that is in the heavens and on the earth were created only out of the heavens. He cites it from here: “For He says to the snow: Be on the earth” (Job 37:6) – just as the snow, though its [ultimate] place of existence is on the earth, is created only in the heavens, so, too, everything that is in the heavens and on the earth, its creation is only out of the heavens. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosef: Everything that is in the heavens and on the earth, its creation is only out of the earth. That is what is written: “For, just as the rain and the snow descend from the heavens…” (Isaiah 55:10) – just as the rain, even though its descent is from the heavens, its creation is only out of the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Rain comes from water evaporated from the oceans.</i> so, too, everything that is in the heavens and on the earth, its creation is only from the earth. Rabbi Yudan cites it from here: “Everything was from the dust, and everything returns to the dust” (Ecclesiastes 3:20). Rav Naḥman said: Even the orb of the sun, as it is stated: “He says to the sun [<i>ḥeres</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The verse calls the sun <i>ḥeres</i>, which usually means earthenware.</i> and it does not shine” (Job 9:7).
Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When a flesh-and-blood king builds a palace, after he builds the lower levels he builds the upper levels. But the Holy One blessed be He created the heavenly realm and the earthly realm with one creation. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: When a flesh-and-blood king crafts a ship, first he brings the boards, then he brings cedars,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For the masts.</i> then he brings the anchors, and then he brings the navigators. But the Holy One blessed be He created them [the creations of the world] and those that steer it [at once]. That is what is written: “So said God, the Lord, Creator of the heavens and who unfurled them [<i>venoteihem</i>]” (Isaiah 42:5) – “and their navigators [<i>venavateihem</i>] is written.
Rabbi Yitzḥak and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yitzḥak said: When a flesh-and-blood king builds a tent and stretches the tent tautly, with the passage of time it sags a bit. However, here [concerning God’s “tent”], “can you stretch out the heavens with Him?” (Job 37:18). And lest you say that they sag, the verse states: “Strong as a cast mirror” (Job 37:18). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: When a mortal man powerfully casts a vessel, with the passage of time it rusts. However, here, “strong as a cast mirror” – they appear like a mirror. Rabbi Azarya said regarding this statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: “Because on it He rested from all His labor [that God created to make]. These are the outgrowths of the heavens and the earth when they were created” (Genesis 2:3–4) – [Why are these two verses juxtaposed?] It means that a day ends and another day begins, a week ends and another week begins, a month ends and another month begins, a year ends and another year begins.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The two verses are juxtaposed because after He completed Creation, the world continued to function with regularity, retaining the state of creation as it was when it was completed.</i>
“On the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens” – Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, Beit Shammai say: [During creation, God’s] thought took place at night and [His] action during the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">As it is written “on the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens” – the making took place during the day.</i> Beit Hillel say: [Both His] thought and His action took place during the day. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: I am astonished. How is it that the fathers of the world, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, disputed regarding the creation of the heavens and the earth? Rather, [His] thought took place both during the day and at night, and [His] action took place with the dimming of the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Just before sunset.</i>
“The Lord God” – this is analogous to a king who had empty cups [of very thin glass]. The king said: If I pour hot water into them, they will shatter; [if I pour very] cold water, they will crack. What did the king do? He mixed hot and cold water and placed it in them, and they endured. So, the Holy One blessed be He said: If I create the world with [just] the attribute of mercy, there will be many sinners; if [just] with the attribute of strict justice, how will the world endure? Rather, I will create it with [both] the attribute of justice and the attribute of mercy, would that it will endure.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Thus it is written, “on the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,” “the Lord” signifying His attribute of mercy, and “God” signifying His attribute of strict justice.</i>
“The earth and the heavens” – this is analogous to a legion that was the first to crown the king. The king said: Since this legion crowned me first, I am granting it a commendation that it should never depart away from me. So, the Holy One blessed be He said: Since it was the earth that first fulfilled My desire,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">By immediately bringing forth vegetation upon His command (Genesis 1:12).</i> I am granting it a commendation that it will never depart away from Me. That is what is written: “He established the earth on its foundations, never to falter” (Psalms 104:5).

Chapter 13

<b>“All the shrubs of the field had yet to be in the earth, and no vegetation of the field had yet to sprout, because the Lord God did not cause it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground” (Genesis 2:5).</b> <br>“All the shrubs of the field had yet to be in the earth” – here it says: “All the shrubs of the field […and no vegetation],”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that nothing grew from the ground before Adam was created.</i> but later it says: “The Lord God grew from the ground [every tree]” (Genesis 2:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to what happened before Adam’s creation.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina said: There it is referring to the Garden of Eden, and here it is referring to the development of [the rest of] the world.

That is the first time this full name of God is used.</i> Rabbi Ḥilfai said: Just as it mentions a complete name for a complete world [in that verse],so it mentions a complete name [here,] regarding rainfall. <br>Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai said: Three matters are of equal importance to one another, and they are: Earth [<i>eretz</i>], man [<i>adam</i>], and rain [<i>matar</i>]. Rabbi Levi bar Ḥiyya said: The three of them are each of three letters, to teach you that if there is no earth there is no rain, and if there is no rain there is no earth, and without the two of them, there is no man.
Rabbi Hoshaya said: Remarkable is the might of rain,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">God’s might as exhibited through rainfall.</i> as it is the equivalent of the entire act of Creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In that it is a metaphysical event, beyond the predictable rules of nature.</i> What is the source? “Who performs great things, and there is no fathoming” (Job 5:9). Through what? “He gives rain over the face of the earth, and sends water over the surface of fields” (Job 5:10). Rabbi Aḥa cites it from here: “He makes the earth with His might, founds the world with His wisdom” (Jeremiah 10:12). What is written thereafter? “To the sound of His placement of the multitude of water in the heavens” (Jeremiah 10:13), and “sound” refers to none other than rain, as it is stated: “Depths call to depths in the sound of your waterways” (Psalms 42:8).
Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It [rain] indicates [divine] favor [<i>meratze</i>] comparable to [that which is facilitated by] offerings, as it is stated [regarding rain]: “Lord, You showed favor to [<i>ratzita</i>] Your land” (Psalms 85:2), and elsewhere it is written: “They will be offered up with acceptance [<i>ratzon</i>] upon My altar” (Isaiah 56:7, 60:7). Rabbi Simon said: It is even [compared to] ingathering of the exiles,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In terms of the salvation that it brings to the world.</i> as it is stated [there]: “You returned Jacob from captivity” (Psalms 85:2). Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Marya says: It is a [sign of] quelling fury, as it is stated [there]: “You quelled all Your fury” (Psalms 85:4). Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai said: It is even [a sign of] atonement for sins, as it is stated [there]: “You bore the iniquity of Your people” (Psalms 85:3).
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: It is of equal importance to the revival of the dead. Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rabbi Abba said: Indeed, the Sages placed it in [the prayers in the blessing of] the revival of the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The second blessing of the <i>Amida </i>prayer.</i> <br>In regard to this one [rain] a hand is mentioned, and in regard to that one [the revival of the dead] a hand is mentioned; in regard to this one [rain], opening up is mentioned, and in regard to that one [the revival of the dead], opening up is mentioned. In this one, a hand is mentioned, as it is stated [regarding Ezekiel’s resurrection of the dry bones]: “The hand of the Lord was upon me…” (Ezekiel 37:1). In that one, a hand is mentioned: “You open Your hand [and amply feed all living beings]” (Psalms 145:16). In this one, opening up is mentioned: “The Lord will open up for you [His good storehouse, the heavens, to provide the rain of your land]” (Deuteronomy 28:12). In that one, opening up is mentioned: “Behold, I am opening up your graves…” (Ezekiel 37:12). Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Elazar bar Avina: This one has song<i> </i>associated with it and that one has song<i> </i>associated with it. This one has song<i> </i>associated with it: “Those who dwell in the rocks<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The dead.</i> will sing” (Isaiah 42:11). And that one has song associated with it<i> </i>[as it is stated regarding rainfall]: “They shout for joy and they sing [<i>yashiru</i>]” (Psalms 65:14). <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: It [rainfall] is in fact greater than the revival of the dead, as the revival of the dead benefits only people, whereas this [rainfall] benefits people and animals; the revival of the dead benefits only Israel, whereas this [rainfall] benefits Israel and idolaters. A certain idolater once asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, saying to him: ‘You have holidays and we have holidays; when you are rejoicing we are not rejoicing, and when we are rejoicing you are not rejoicing. When do you and we both rejoice? When rain falls. What is the source for this? “The meadows are covered with flocks of sheep; the valleys are wrapped in grain. They shout for joy, and they sing” (Psalms 65:14). What is written thereafter? “Shout to God, priests, Levites, and Israelites” is not written, but rather, “shout to God, all the earth”’ (Psalms 66:1). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When the rain falls, the animals seek to mate. What is the source? “The meadows are covered with flocks of sheep [<i>laveshu karim hatzon</i>]” (Psalms 65:14) – a euphemism for the rams mounting the sheep.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew could be translated “the rams [<i>karim</i>] cover over [<i>laveshu</i>] the ewes [<i>hatzon</i>].”</i>
“And there was no man to till [<i>laavod</i>] the ground” – there was no man to induce people to worship [<i>lehaavid</i>] the Holy One blessed be He, like Elijah the prophet and Ḥoni HaMe’agel.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Both of them brought about rainfall with their prayers.</i> <br>“And there was no man to till the ground” – man was created only for toil. If he merits, his toil is with Torah. If he does not merit, his toil is with the earth. Fortunate is the person whose toil is with Torah.
“Because the Lord God did not cause it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man…” – were it not for man, there would be no covenant made with the earth to cause rain to fall on it, as it is stated: “Who would…bring rain on land with no man, or on a wilderness with no person in it?” (Job 38:26).
“All the streams go to the sea, [yet the sea is not full; to the place that the streams go, there they go again]” (Ecclesiastes 1:7) – there was an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, who set sail in the Great Sea, and their ship entered a place in the sea where the water was not moving. Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: ‘We came here only for some test.’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">To learn something from our experience.</i> They filled a barrel of water from that place. When they arrived in Rome, Hadrian, may his bones be crushed, said to them: ‘What is the nature of seawater?’<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">How is it that the sea does not flood the land with all the streams that flow into it?</i> They said to him: ‘It contains water that absorbs water.’<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Certain seawater has the ability to absorb other water into itself without swelling over.</i> He said to them: ‘Give me some of it [to test].’ They gave him a bowlful.

Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda says: Like the Nile, which [floods over and] waters, and then waters again. Rabbi Neḥemya said: Like the inside of the [bed of the] Kavriya Stream, which wells up [and waters it] and is absorbed back into the ground. The rabbis say: It is like the Tavai. There is a river in Babylon named Tavai. Why do they call it Tavai? It is because it irrigates [its surroundings] once in forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>tavai</i> is related to <i>tohu</i> (emptiness), as, in between its rare inundations, the surrounding area is desolate.</i> <br>That is the way that the earth was irrigated at the beginning, as it is written: “A mist would rise from the earth,” but the Holy One blessed be He reconsidered, [ordaining] that the earth should [thenceforth] be watered only from above. Rabbi Ḥanan of Tzippori said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Naḥman: The Holy One blessed be He reconsidered, [ordaining] that the earth should be watered only from above, for four reasons: Because of powerful people;<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">That they should not use their might to take all the water for themselves.</i> in order to wash away harmful dew;<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">That had accumulated on the crops.</i> so that the highlands could be watered just like the lowlands; and so that everyone would direct their eyes heavenward.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">To pray to God for rain.</i> That is what is written: “To raise the lowly on High” (Job 5:11).
From where does the earth receive its [rain] water? Rabbi Eliezer says: From the water of the ocean,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The ocean water evaporates to form clouds, and that water falls as rain.</i> as it is written: “A mist would rise from the earth.” Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But is the ocean water not salty?<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">So how can you say that rain originates there?</i> He said to him: It becomes sweetened in the clouds, as it is written: “Which the skies distill” (Job 36:28). Where is it distilled? In the skies. Rabbi Yehoshua says: [Rain comes] from the upper waters, as it is stated: “By the rains of the heavens it drinks water” (Deuteronomy 11:11). The clouds rise up from the earth to the firmament and there [from above] they receive it [rain] as from the mouth of a jug, as it is written: “Which cluster into rain from His mist” (Job 36:27). And they [the clouds] separate it [the water] like a type of sieve, so that no drop touches its counterpart, as it is written: “Dripping water, thick clouds of the skies [<i>sheḥakim</i>]” (II Samuel 22:12).  <br>Why does he call it [the sky] <i>sheḥakim</i>? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It is because it crushes [<i>shoḥakim</i>] the water [into little pieces]. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Like an omasum.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A digestive organ in ruminants that crushes their food.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Like an animal’s intestines.
Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Clouds come only from above, as it is stated: “And behold, among the clouds of the heavens” (Daniel 7:13). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Clouds come only from below, as it is stated: “He makes clouds ascend from the ends of the earth” (Psalms 135:7). According to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, it is analogous to one who gifts someone a cask of wine along with its pitcher. Rabbi Shimon says: It is analogous to one who said to another: ‘Lend me a <i>se’a </i>of wheat.’ He says to him: ‘Bring your basket and come measure [the wheat] into it.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He says to the earth: ‘Bring your clouds and receive rain.’
It [a cloud] is called by five names: <i>Av </i>(Judges 5:4), <i>ed </i>(Genesis 2:6), <i>anan </i>(Genesis 9:13), <i>nesiim </i>(Jeremiah 10:13), <i>ḥaziz </i>(Zechariah 10:1). <i>Av</i> – because it darkens [<i>me’abev</i>] the face of the firmament. <i>Ed</i> – because it ruins the celebration [<i>eid</i>] of the price gougers.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Who profiteer during droughts.</i> <i>Anan</i> – because it makes people tolerant [<i>anavim</i>] of one another. <i>Nesiim </i>– because it makes people regard each other as aristocrats [<i>nesiim</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">People earn money from their crops.</i> <i>Ḥaziz </i>– because it creates [colorful] spectacles [<i>ḥezyonot</i>] in the heavens, and because it causes the divine spirit to rest upon the people,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Rain indicates divine favor (see section 5).</i> as it says: “The vision [<i>ḥazon</i>] of Isaiah son of Amotz” (Isaiah 1:1). <br>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Earth is called by four names, corresponding to its four seasons: <i>Eretz </i>(Genesis 1:1), <i>tevel </i>(I Samuel 2:8), <i>adama </i>(Genesis 1:25), <i>arka </i>(Jeremiah 10:11). <i>Eretz</i> – corresponding to the season of Nisan [spring], because it accelerates [<i>meritza</i>] production of its produce. <i>Tevel </i>– corresponding to the season of Tamuz [summer], because it brings flavor [<i>metabelet</i>] to its produce. <i>Adama</i> – corresponding to the season of Tishrei [autumn], as the ground becomes disparate clods of earth [<i>adama</i>]. <i>Arka </i>– corresponding to the season of Tevet [winter], because it causes its produce to wither [<i>moreket</i>].
How much rain needs to fall to constitute “permeation”?<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">There are certain halakhic ramifications that occur when there is enough rain to constitute “permeation,” so a definition of the term is required.</i> When [the rain reaches] the depth of a plow blade, which is three handbreadths, this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: In hard earth, one handbreadth; in moderate earth, two handbreadths; in moist earth, three handbreadths. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: There is no handbreadth of rain falling from above that does not have [the water inside] the earth rise a corresponding two handbreadths. What is the source? “Depths call to depths in the sound of your waterways…” (Psalms 42:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The two “depths” in the verse represent the two handbreadths of rising underground water, and “your waterways” refers to the handbreadth of rain.</i> Rabbi Levi said: The upper waters [rain] are like males and the lower [underground] waters are like females, and one [the upper] says to the other [the lower]: ‘Accept us; you are the creation of the Holy One blessed be He and we are His emissaries.’ They thereupon accept them. That is what is written: “Let the earth open” (Isaiah 45:8) – like the female that opens herself up for the male. “Salvation will flourish [<i>veyifru</i>]” (Isaiah 45:8) – because they [the two kinds of waters] are fruitful and multiply.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">They are plentiful.</i> “And righteousness will sprout together” (Isaiah 45:8) – this refers to the falling of rain. “I, the Lord, created it” (Isaiah 45:8) – this is why I created it, for the improvement of the world and its settlement.
Rabbi Berekhya said: A calamity<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eid </i>can also mean calamity, as in Deuteronomy 32:35.</i> ascended from the earth, and thereupon “and watered all of the surface of the ground” (Genesis 2:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">When a calamity occurs, people are chastened by it, and the resultant repentance brings about the end of a drought.</i> This is like the opinion of Rabbi Berekhya, as Rabbi Berekhya said: “My lesson will fall [<i>yaarof</i>] as rain…” (Deuteronomy 32:2) – when the necks [<i>oref</i>] of the people are broken [through tragedy],<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">When they repent.</i> at that point rain falls.
How much rain must fall for one to be obligated to recite the blessing [over rainfall]? Rabbi Yosei in the name of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yona in the name of Rabbi Shmuel said: For the first rain of the season, enough to permeate [the earth], and at the end of the season,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">When small amounts of rain had fallen previously.</i> any amount. Rabbi Ḥiyya said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: For the first rain of the season, enough to permeate [the earth], and at the end of the season, not until the surface of the roof tiles are rinsed off. Rabbi Yanai ben Rabbi Yishmael said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: For the first rain of the season, enough to permeate [the earth], and at the end of the season, enough that the sealant on top of the wine jug becomes soaked. But surely even a great deal of rain could fall and the sealant would not become soaked?<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is waterproof.</i> It is, rather, until it appears that it is soaked.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Enough water collects on it to give it the appearance of being soaked.</i> <br>What blessing should one recite [over the rain]? It is as we learned: For rain and other good tidings, one recites: ‘Blessed [is God]…Who is good and beneficent.’ Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Levi derives this from here: “Cold water on a weary soul, so is good news from a distant land” (Proverbs 25:25) – just as for good news one recites: ‘[Blessed is God…] Who is good and beneficent,’<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Brachot</i> 54a.</i> for cold water [i.e., rain], too, one recites: ‘[Blessed is God…] Who is good and beneficent.’ Rabbi Yehuda said: This is the blessing that my father Yeḥezkel would recite [over rain]: May Your name be blessed, exalted, and magnified for each and every drop that you cause to fall for us, which you keep separate from one another.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Translation follows the unanimously recommended textual emendation שאתה ממניען אלו מאלו.</i> <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shimon said: He rains them [the raindrops] down by measure, as it is stated: “For He deducts [<i>yegara</i>] drops of water” (Job 36:27), just as it says: “It shall be deducted [<i>venigra</i>] from the valuation” (Leviticus 27:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">All deduction is by measure.</i> <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Yaakov once went up to visit Rabbi Yehuda of Migdal. He heard his voice reciting this blessing: ‘Thousands upon thousands and myriads upon myriads of blessings and thanks we would require to thank Your name for each and every drop that You cause to rain down for us, for You bestow good rewards [even] to sinners.’ He said to him: ‘That is the blessing that Rabbi Simon would recite.’ Rabbi Zeira said: ‘There [in Babylonia] they say: When low prices prevail in the world, when bounty comes to the world, and when a river inundates the countryside, one recites: Blessed [is God]…Who is good and beneficent.’
“And water all” – Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Zimra: Everything is blessed [when it rains]; commerce is blessed, and the merchants profit. Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Levi said: Even those afflicted with boils benefit [from the rain]. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: The ill also benefit, and their limbs become light for them. Avimai, one of the scholars, used to visit the ill when the “permeation” rain fell. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to him: ‘How are they doing?’ He said to him: ‘They feel relief.’ Rabbi Abba says: Even a gemstone senses it [the rain].<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The rain causes their quality to increase.</i> The Rabbis say: Even the fish sense it.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Though they live underwater.</i> Rabbi Pinḥas said: There was an incident near Akko in which they caught a fish and, [based on its size], they estimated that it would weigh three hundred pounds, but they weighed it at two hundred pounds. There was an elderly fisherman there, who said to them: ‘It is because the “permeation” rain has not yet fallen.’ After it fell, they caught a fish and estimated that it would weigh two hundred pounds, but they weighed it at three hundred pounds.
Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon said: The land is watered only at its upper layer. If so, what should the roots of the carob tree and the roots of the sycamore do, as their roots reach into the depths [of the earth]? Rather, each and every [tree] is watered according to its needs. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Rabbi Izka and Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: The roots of a wheat stalk breach the ground up to fifty cubits. The roots of the fig tree breach rocks. Rabbi Levi said: It is as you<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon.</i> said: [The land is watered] only up to its upper layer; and as for the carob tree and the sycamore, once in thirty days the waters of the depths rise and water them. What is the source? “I, the Lord, guard it; at set times I water it” (Isaiah 27:3). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When the rain falls, it gives the ground a new face [<i>panim</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">It causes greenery to grow. This is expounded from the phrase “the surface [<i>penei</i>]<i> </i>of the ground.”</i>

Chapter 14

<b>“The Lord God formed the man of dirt from the ground and He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul” (Genesis 2:7).</b> <br>“The Lord God formed” – it is written: “A king will uphold the land with justice [but a man of <i>terumot </i>destroys it]” (Proverbs 29:4). “A king” – this is the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He. “Will uphold the land with justice” – as He created the world with [the attribute of] justice, as it is stated: “In the beginning, God [<i>Elohim</i>] created” (Genesis 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Throughout the creation narrative, God is referred to as Elohim, indicating his attribute of strict justice.</i> “But a man of <i>terumot</i> destroys it” – this is Adam the first man, who was the <i>ḥalla </i>of the completion of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ḥalla </i>is separated after the completion of the dough, and is endowed with sanctity, given to a priest to eat. Adam was intended to be the sacred finale to the creation of the world.</i> <i>Ḥalla</i> is called <i>teruma</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teruma</i> refers to a portion of something set aside as sacred. </i> as it is stated: “The first of your kneading basket [you shall separate as a loaf, as <i>teruma</i>]” (Numbers 15:20). Rabbi Yosei ben Ketzarta said: It is like a woman who mixes her dough with water and [then] separates its <i>ḥalla </i>from its midst; so, too, first “a mist would rise from the earth”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Forming a dough-like mixture with the earth.</i> (Genesis 2:6), and then, “The Lord God formed [man]…”
“Formed" [<i>Vayitzer</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayitzer</i> is written with the letter <i>yod</i> appearing twice, although in verse 19, regarding the creation of the animals, the same word is spelled with just one <i>yod</i>.</i> – there were two acts of formation [involved in the creation of humanity], the formation of man and the formation of woman, a formation of seven [months] and a formation of nine [months].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to the Midrash, some babies are born after a gestation of seven months, others after nine months. A fetus that developed in the womb for eight months was considered unviable.</i> Rav Huna said: If it was formed according to the seven [month process], and then born during the eighth or ninth [month], it can live. But if it was formed according to the nine [month process] and born during the eighth, it will not live, all the more so [if it is born] during the seventh.  <br>They asked before Rabbi Abahu: From where is it derived that a fetus born during the seventh month can survive, [but one born during the eighth cannot]? He said to them: From your own [language] I will prove it to you: <i>Zeta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is the name of the seventh letter of the ancient Greek alphabet, and also means ‘live.’ </i> – <i>epta</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It means seven. Seven thus indicates life.</i>; <i>eta<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The name of the eighth Greek letter, also meaning “dying.” </i> </i>– <i>okto</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It means eight. Eight thus indicates death.</i>
“Formed” [<i>Vayitzer</i>] – there were two acts of formation [involved in the creation of man], a formation from the lower realms and a formation from the upper realms. Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak and the Rabbis in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: He created in him four creations from the upper realms and four from the lower realms. He [man] eats and drinks like an animal, procreates like an animal, defecates like an animal, and dies like an animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">These are all characteristics associated with creatures of the lower realm (earth).</i> From the upper realms: He stands upright, speaks, understands, and sees like ministering angels. But does an animal not [also] see? This is bewildering. The difference is that this one [a human] has peripheral vision. <br>Rabbi Tafduyei said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The supernal beings were created in the [divine] image and likeness, but do not procreate, while the earthly beings [that have been created up to now] procreate, but were not created in the [divine] image and likeness. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I will create him [Adam] in the [divine] image and likeness, [a trait] from the supernal realm, but he will procreate, [a trait] from the earthly realm.’ Rabbi Tafduyei said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I create him from the supernal realm, he will live and never die; if from the earthly realm, he will die and will not live. Rather, I will create him from [both] these [the supernal] and those [the earthly]. If he sins, he will die; if he does not, he will live.’
“Formed" [<i>Vayitzer</i>] – [alluding to man’s] two inclinations [<i>yetzarim</i>], the good inclination and the evil inclination. Were an animal to have two inclinations, when it would see a person with a knife in his hand ready to slaughter it, it would die of fright. But does man not have two inclinations [and nevertheless does not die of fright]? Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ida said: “He forms [<i>yotzer</i>] the spirit of man within him” (Zechariah 12:1) – this teaches that a person’s soul is bound up [<i>tzerura</i>] within him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">And that is why man, despite possessing two inclinations, does not easily die.</i> Were it not so, whenever he would experience anguish, he would shed it [his soul] and cast it off from himself.
“Formed” [<i>Vayitzer</i>] – there were two acts of formation [involved in the creation of man], a formation for [his life in] this world and a formation for [his life in] the World to Come.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When the dead bodies of the righteous will again take form at the resurrection.</i> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, Beit Shammai say: The formation that takes place in this world and the formation that takes place in the World to Come are not the same. In this world, it [man’s formation in the womb] begins with skin and flesh and finishes with sinews and bones, but in the future, it will begin with sinews and bones and finish with skin and flesh, as that is what it says regarding the corpses of Ezekiel: “I saw, and behold, there were sinews upon them,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Upon the bones.</i> and flesh grew, [and skin covered them]” (Ezekiel 37:8). Rabbi Yonatan said: We cannot learn anything from Ezekiel’s corpses.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Because they already had bones. In the future resurrection, there will be no bones.</i> To what were Ezekiel’s corpses comparable? To one who enters a bathhouse; what he takes off first [when undressing] he puts on last [when dressing]. <br>Beit Hillel say: Just as his formation takes place in this world so will his formation take place in the World to Come. In this world, it [man’s formation in the womb] begins with skin and flesh and finishes with sinews and bones, so, too, in the future, it will begins with skin and flesh and finish with sinews and bones, as Job says: “Do You not pour me [<i>tatikheni</i>] like milk [and curdle me like cheese, clothe me with skin and flesh and cover me with bones and sinews]?” (Job 10:10–11) – <i>hitakhtani</i> [in past tense]<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Which would have referred to his formation in the womb.</i> is not written here, but rather <i>tatikheni</i> [in future tense].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the resurrection in the future. </i> “And curdle me [<i>takpieni</i>] like cheese” (Job 10:10) – <i>hikpetani </i>[in past tense]<i> </i>is not written here, but rather, <i>takpieni, </i>[in future tense]. “You clothe me [<i>talbisheni</i>] with skin and flesh” – <i>hilbashtani</i> [in past tense] is not written here, but rather, <i>talbisheni, </i>[in future tense]. “And cover me [<i>tesokhekheni</i>] with bones and sinews” (Job 10:11) – <i>sokhakhtani</i> [in past tense] is not written here, but rather, <i>tesokhekheni </i>[in future tense]. This is analogous to a bowl filled with milk. Before putting the rennet in it the milk is loose; after putting in the rennet, the milk congeals and sets. That is what Job said: “Do You not pour me like milk [and curdle me like cheese]…skin and flesh…You granted me life and kindness, and Your command preserved my spirit” (Job 10:12).
“[The Lord God formed] the man [<i>ha’adam</i>]” – due to the merit of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">“The man,” with the definite article, seems to be alluding to a particular man. The Midrash expounds that it is an allusion to Abraham, as it goes on to show.</i> Rabbi Levi said: “The greatest man [<i>ha’adam</i>] among the giants” (Joshua 14:15) – this is Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Who was a giant in the spiritual sense.</i> Why does it call him great? It is because he was worthy of being created before Adam. However, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Perhaps he will bring ruin [to the world] and there will be no one to come along to remedy [the damage] that he had wrought. Rather, I will create Adam first, as if he brings ruin [to the world], Abraham will come along and remedy what he had wrought.’ <br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: The way of the world is that if a person has a sturdy beam, where does he place it? Is it not in the middle of the Great Hall, so that it can support the [weaker] beams that are in front of it and the beams that are behind it? So, too, why did the Holy One blessed be He create Abraham in the middle of the generations? So that he would support the [unworthy] generations that are before him and the generations that are after him. Rabbi Levi said: One might introduce a virtuous woman into a house with a corrupted woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">If one has a corrupted wife, he might take a second wife who is more virtuous, hoping that the new wife will influence the first one for the better.</i> but one would not introduce a corrupt woman into a house with a virtuous woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In this case the second wife would be a negative influence on the first one. This explains why Abraham came into the world after Adam.</i>
“[The Lord God formed the man] of dirt [<i>afar</i>]” – [read the word] <i>ofer</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, a young gazelle.</i> meaning a young man, as he was created in his full form.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Adam was not created as a baby, but as a full-grown young man.</i> Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon said: Eve, too, was created in her full form. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Adam and Eve were created [with the bodies of people who were] approximately twenty years old. <br>Rabbi Huna said: [“Dirt [<i>afar</i>] from the ground [<i>adama</i>]”].<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Both <i>afar</i> and <i>adama</i> refer to earth, so what is the significance of using both terms?</i> <i>Afar</i> is a masculine word, <i>adama</i> is a feminine word. A potter brings masculine dirt and feminine ground<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">He mixes coarse clay with fine clay in order to construct the best pottery.</i> so that the vessels he makes will be strong.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Adam was created from two different kinds of earth to make him more robust.</i> <br>There was an incident involving an individual from Tzippori whose son died. [Some say the mourner himself was a heretic, and] others say that a heretic was sitting before him [to console him]. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta went up to visit him. He [the heretic] saw that he [Rabbi Yosei] was sitting there and smiling. He said to him: ‘Why are you smiling?’ He said to him: ‘We have faith in the Lord of heaven that you will behold his face [once again] in the World to Come.’ He said to him: ‘Is this man’s grief not enough for him, that you come and aggrieve him further?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">With such nonsense.</i> Are there earthenware vessels that can be repaired? Is it not written: “Shatter them like a potter’s vessel”?’ (Psalms 2:9) he asked in bewilderment.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">So, too, a dead body cannot be restored to life, as the verse compares man to earthenware.</i> He said to him: ‘An earthenware vessel is formed with water, and is firmed by fire. A glass vessel, [in contrast,] is formed with fire and is firmed with fire. Yet this one [glassware], when broken, can be repaired, while that one [earthenware], when broken, cannot be repaired? This is astonishing.’ He [the heretic] said to him: ‘It is because it [glass ware] is made by blowing.’ He said to him: ‘Let your ears hear what your own mouth is saying. If this one [glassware], that is made with the breath of mortal man, can be repaired, [that which is made] with the breath of the Holy One blessed be He, all the more so.’ <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the aforementioned verse, which compares man to earthenware.</i> “Shatter them like an earthenware vessel” is not written here, but rather, “Shatter them like a potter’s vessel” (Psalm 2:9) – a potter’s vessel [refers to one] that has not yet been fired, and can be repaired.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">So, too, man will be resurrected after death.</i>
“From the ground [<i>adama</i>]” – Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Ḥelbo said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: From the place of his atonement he was created, just as it says: “You shall make for Me an altar of earth [<i>adama</i>]” (Exodus 20:21). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I will create him from the place of his atonement; then there is hope that perhaps he will endure.’ <br>“And breathed into his nostrils” – this teaches that He stood up his [Adam’s] lifeless mass from the earth to the heavens and [there] injected a soul into it. In this world, it [the spirit] is [injected into man] by blowing, and that is why he dies; but in the future, it [the spirit] will be [injected] by [direct] placement,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">And will therefore be immortal.</i> as it is stated: “I will place My spirit in you and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:14).
It [man’s soul] is called by five names: <i>nefesh </i>(Genesis 2:7), <i>ruaḥ </i>(Ezekiel 37:14), <i>neshama </i>(Genesis 2:7), <i>yeḥida </i>(Psalms 22:21), <i>ḥaya </i>(Psalms 143:3). <i>Nefesh</i> – this refers to blood, as it is stated: “For blood is the soul [<i>nefesh</i>]” (Deuteronomy 12:23). <i>Ruaḥ</i> – because it ascends and descends, as it is stated: “Who knows the spirit of the sons of man? Does it ascend upward?” (Ecclesiastes 3:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ruaḥ</i> also means wind, which ascends and descends.</i> <i>Neshama </i>– this refers to man’s intellect, as people say: Intellect is good. <i>Ḥaya</i> – because all of one’s limbs may die, but it [the soul] remains alive [<i>ḥaya</i>] in the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">A person can lose the use of his limbs, but he cannot live without a soul.</i> <i>Yeḥida – </i>because all of one’s limbs are in pairs, but it [the soul] is solitary [<i>yeḥida</i>] in the body.  <br>This is what is written: “If He directs His attention to him, his spirit [<i>ruḥo</i>] and his soul [<i>nishmato</i>] He will gather to him” (Job 34:14). Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya said: If God would direct his attention to this person, his spirit would already be in His hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">If God would so desire, a person would die in his sleep.</i> “And his soul He will gather to him” – [if He would gather the soul into one single place] in his body, the entire man would die.

That is what is written: “The spirit [<i>neshama</i>] of man is the lamp of the Lord” (Proverbs 20:27). <br>Rabbi Bisni, Rabbi Aḥa, and Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Meir: The <i>neshama</i> fills the entire body, and when a person sleeps, it ascends upward and draws life for him from above. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: For each and every breath that a person takes, he must laud the Creator. What is the source? “Let every soul [<i>neshama</i>] praise God” (Psalms 150:6) – [read instead:] Let every breath [<i>neshima</i>] praise God.
“Man became a living [<i>ḥaya</i>] soul” – Rabbi Yehuda said: This teaches that He made him a tail like a beast [<i>ḥaya</i>], but then removed it from him for the sake of his dignity. Rav Huna said: He made him like an indentured servant to himself, so that if he does not toil he does not eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In that sense he is like a domesticated animal [<i>ḥaya</i>].</i> This is the like opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, who said: “The Lord delivered me into the hands [<i>biydei</i>] of one against whom I cannot stand (Lamentations 1:14) – one toils at night and during the day,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For his livelihood.</i> but never attains [enough].<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>biydei</i> is read <i>beyadi,</i> into my own hands.

Chapter 15

<b>“The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, to the east; He placed there the man whom He had formed” (Genesis 2:8).</b> <br>“The Lord God planted a garden in Eden, to the east” – the school of Rabbi Yanai says: Why does it mention a full name<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord God, as opposed to within the creation narrative, which mentions only the name <i>Elohim</i> (God).</i> regarding the planting of the garden? It is because from the beginning of its planting it requires forethought.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The full name of God indicates that He put in a great deal of planning, as it were, when planting the garden.</i> From the start, [even] before it emerges from its mother’s womb,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is a metaphor, referring to the emergence of a stalk from its seed. </i> a person must plan out which direction is appropriate for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Some trees fare better in a northern location, others in a southern; some require one type of soil, others a different type. Planning the location where a sapling will be placed is necessary even before the sapling is uprooted from its original place, as soon as the stalk begins to sprout.</i> That is what is written: “The trees of the Lord are sated, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted” (Psalms 104:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is seen as a reference to the Garden of Eden.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina said: They [the initial saplings] were as [tiny as] the antennae of grasshoppers when the Holy One blessed be He uprooted them and planted them in the Garden of Eden. <br>“The trees of the Lord are sated…” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: They are sated with the lives that they live,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">They live a long time.</i> they are sated with the water that they need, they are sated in their planting.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Even cuttings that are taken from them and replanted elsewhere thrive and prosper.</i> <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The world was not worthy of using cedars [for secular buildings], as they were created solely for the purpose of the Temple. That is what is written: “The trees of the Lord are sated, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted.” And “Lebanon” is nothing other than the Temple, as it says: “That goodly mountain and the Lebanon” (Deuteronomy 3:25).  <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: There are twenty-four species of cedar, but only seven are the highest quality of them all. That is what is written: “I will put cedar [<i>erez</i>], <i>shita</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The seven tree names in this verse cannot be identified with certainty, but the Midrash considers them all to be of the cedar family.</i> [<i>hadas</i> and <i>etz shemen</i> in the wilderness; I will place in the desert <i>berosh</i>, <i>tidhar</i> and <i>te’ashur</i> together]” (Isaiah 41:19). <i>Berosh</i> – <i>berata</i>, <i>tidhar</i> – <i>adera</i>, <i>te’ashur </i>– <i>paksinon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">These are their Aramaic translations.</i> Why is it called <i>te’ashur</i>? It is because it is the most praiseworthy [<i>me’ushar</i>] of them all. They [subsequently] added three more to the list: <i>Alonim</i>, <i>armonim</i>, and <i>almugim</i>, <i>Alonim </i>– <i>balutin</i>,<i> armonim </i>– <i>dalbon</i>,<i> almugim </i>– <i>alvam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">These, too, are Aramaic translations of the Hebrew tree names.</i>
“A garden in Eden” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Yehuda says: The garden is larger than Eden, as it is stated: “All the trees of Eden that were in God’s garden envied it” (Ezekiel 31:9), [and it is stated: “You were in Eden, of God’s garden” (Ezekiel 28:13)].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The implication in both verses is that the place called Eden is located within the Garden.</i> Rabbi Yosei says: Eden is larger than the garden, as it is stated: “The Lord God planted a garden in Eden.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Indicating that the garden is located within Eden.</i> It is written: “A river emerges from Eden to water the garden” (Genesis 2:10). According to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, [this means that] from the runoff of a <i>beit kor</i>, a <i>tarkav</i> could be watered.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tarkav</i> and <i>beit kor </i>are units of area, <i>tarkav</i> being one-sixtieth of a <i>beit kor</i>. The verse is saying that the smaller garden was watered by the runoff from the much larger Eden.</i> According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it is like a spring that is situated in [the middle of] the garden and waters the entire garden. But Rabbi Yehuda adduces two verses, whereas Rabbi Yosei adduces only one verse. Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori said: The Holy One blessed be He illuminated the eyes of Rabbi Yosei and he found another verse that was decisive in addition to the first. Which is that? “He will render its wilderness like Eden and its desert like the garden of the Lord” (Isaiah 51:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It likens Eden to the wilderness of the Land of Israel, which is larger than its desert to which Eden is likened.</i>
“To the east [<i>mikedem</i>]” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: You may think that it means before the creation of the world, but in fact it means only before the creation of man.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash here interprets <i>mikedem</i> to mean “beforehand” rather than “east.”</i> Man was created on the sixth day, the Garden of Eden on the third day. That is what is written: “For God is my King from times of old [<i>mikedem</i>], working salvation in the midst of the land” (Psalms 74:12) – look at His benevolent works, as the Holy One blessed be He prepared my reward even before I [mankind] began to do anything.
“He placed there [<i>vayasem sham</i>] [the man]” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: He elevated him, just as it says: “You shall set [<i>som tasim</i>] a king over you” (Deuteronomy 17:15). Rabbi Neḥemya said: He enticed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">With all the comforts available in the Garden.</i> This is analogous to a king who prepared a feast and invited a guest. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He invited Adam,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">To the “feast” that had been prepared for him in the Garden.</i> due to the merit of Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba </i>14:6</i> That is what is written: “You know my sitting and my rising; You understand my thoughts from afar” (Psalms 139:2)<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash applies the verse to Adam.</i> – “my sitting” in the Garden of Eden,” “my rising” – my expulsion from it. “You understand my thoughts from afar” – by what merit did You come to the decision to create me? It is by the merit of the one who came from afar, as it is written: “I summon a bird of prey from the east, the man of My counsel from a distant land” (Isaiah 46:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Abraham, whom God summoned from the east.</i>
“He placed there [the man whom He had formed]” – just as it says: “And it is there to this day” (II Chronicles 5:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the Ark in the Temple. The word “there,” appearing in both verses, is used as a verbal analogy to teach that Adam’s placement in the Garden of Eden was intended to be permanent.</i> Rabbi Levi said: Provided that he remain in his present form.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Provided that he remains “the man whom He had formed,” i.e. without sin.</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: It is written: “These are the outgrowths of the heavens [when they were created]” (Genesis 2:4) – their Creator praises them, who can disparage them? Their Creator lauds them, who can find fault with them? Rather, they are beautiful and praiseworthy,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As long as they are as they were created, they will remain that way.</i> [as it is written:] “These are the outgrowths of the heavens.”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This is another interpretation of “the man whom He had formed” – God was speaking the praises of His creation.</i>
<b>“The Lord God grew from the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil” (Genesis 2:9).</b> <br>“The Lord God grew from the ground […and the tree of life]” – it is taught: [The tree of life is] a tree that spreads out over all the living.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The life force of all people emanates from it. </i> Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: [The extent of] the tree of life is a walking distance of five hundred years<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">That is, its influence extends over the entire world.</i> and all the waters of creation branch out from beneath it. Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai: It is not merely that [the extent of] its branches are a walking distance of five hundred years, but even [the extent of] its trunk is a walking distance of five hundred years.
What was that tree [of knowledge] from which Adam and Eve ate? Rabbi Meir said: It was wheat. When a person does not have knowledge, people say: That person has never eaten wheat bread in all his days.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This shows that wheat is a food that stimulates knowledge and intelligence.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak asked before Rabbi Ze’eira, saying to him: ‘Is it possible that it was wheat?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘But is it not written that it was a “tree”?’ He said to him: ‘It [the wheat in Eden] rose to a great height, like the cedars of Lebanon.’<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">And therefore could rightly be described as a “tree.”</i> <br>Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa said: There is a dispute between Rabbi Neḥemya and the Rabbis.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">They were discussing the blessing over bread, which praises God for “bringing forth bread” from the earth. The difficulty is that bread does not, of course, grow from the ground.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: [“Blessed be God…] who brings forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] bread from the earth, [meaning] that He brought forth bread from the earth in the past.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hamotzi</i> (“who brings forth”) can also connote an event in the past (see Numbers 23:22). When Adam was created and placed in the Garden, finished bread grew from the ground. This was discontinued when he sinned.</i> The Rabbis say: [Blessed be God …] who brings forth [<i>motzi</i>] bread from the earth, [meaning] that He will bring forth bread from the earth in the future,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Motzi</i> (“who brings forth”) can also connote an event in the future (see Exodus 6:7). In the Messianic future finished bread will grow from the ground.</i> as it is stated: “There will be bread [<i>pisat</i>] from grain upon the earth” (Psalms 72:16). <br><i>Lefet<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Lefet</i> means turnip. In some dialects, the word <i>pisat</i> (translated in the Psalms verse under discussion as bread) also means turnip. The midrash explains the connection.</i></i> – there is a dispute between two Amora’im, Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak and Rabbi Shmuel bar Ami. One said: <i>Lefet</i> – was it not [once] bread [<i>lo pat</i>]?<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In Adam’s day one did not need to eat turnips, because there was bread growing from the ground.</i> And the other said: <i>Lefet</i> – is it going to be bread [<i>lo pat</i>] in the future?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">In the Messianic future, instead of turnips there will be bread growing from the ground.</i> <br>Rabbi Yirmeya recited the blessing before Rabbi Zeira: Who brings forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] bread from the earth, and he praised him. [Did he act] in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya? This is bewildering.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In a dispute between an individual rabbi and the Rabbis as a group, it is the view of the majority that should be followed. In this case, Rabbi Neḥemya was arguing with the Rabbis.</i> [No,] it was, rather, so as not to slur the [adjacent identical] letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The word before “<i>hamotzi</i>” is <i>haolam, </i>which ends with a <i>mem</i>. Were one to recite the word as <i>motzi,</i> the first letter of <i>motzi</i> would be slurred with the final letter of <i>haolam</i>. Using the word <i>hamotzi</i> solves that problem.</i> <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: They [the forbidden fruits that Adam ate] were grapes, as it is stated: “Their grapes are grapes of poison, clusters of bitterness for them” (Deuteronomy 32:32) – those clusters brought bitterness to the world. <br>Rabbi Abba of Akko said it was a citron. That is what is written: “The woman saw that the tree was good for eating…” (Genesis 3:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that the tree itself had a good taste.</i> Go out and see which is the tree whose wood has a taste like its fruit, and you will find only the citron. <br>Rabbi Yosei says: They were figs. It is a matter that is derived from its context.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">After the sin, Adam and Eve used fig leaves to hide their nakedness (Genesis 3:7).</i> This is analogous to the a prince’s son who sinned with one of the maidservants. When the prince heard, he expelled him and had him removed outside the palace. He circulated among the houses of all the maidservants, but none would receive him. But the one with whom he sinned opened her door and received him. So, too, when Adam the first man ate from that tree, the Holy One blessed be He expelled him and had him removed outside the Garden of Eden. He circulated among all the trees but none would receive him.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">They would not allow him to use their leaves to clothe himself.</i> What did they say to him? Rabbi Berekhya said: ‘Here is the thief who deceived his Creator.’ That is what is written: “Let no arrogant foot come to me” (Psalms 36:12) – the foot of one who was arrogant towards his Creator. “Let the hand of the wicked not move me” (Psalms 36:12) – you may not take a leaf from me. But the fig tree, whose fruit he had eaten, opened its door and received him. That is what is written: “They sewed fig leaves” (Genesis 3:7). <br>What [type of] fig was it ? Rabbi Avin said: It was the <i>berat sheva</i> species, as it brought seven [<i>sheva</i>] days of mourning to the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">As a result of the sin, death, and the ensuing seven-day period of mourning, was introduced into the world.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: It was the <i>berat elita </i>species, as it brought weeping [<i>elita</i>] to the world. <br>Rabbi Azarya and Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Far be it that God should have revealed [the identity of] that tree to any man, nor will He reveal it in the future. See what is written: “A woman who will approach any animal [to copulate with her, you shall kill the woman and the animal]” (Leviticus 20:16) – though the person sinned, what sin did the animal commit? [The animal did not sin,] but it is [killed] so that the animal should not pass through the marketplace, where people would say: This is the animal on whose account so-and-so was stoned.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">And the memory of that woman would be sullied.</i> If He is concerned about the dignity of his [Adam’s] descendants [even though they had committed a grievous sin], is it not all the more so regarding his [Adam’s] own dignity [after his sin]? That is a rhetorical question.

Chapter 16

<b>“A river emerged from Eden to water the garden; and from there it parted and became four headwaters” (Genesis 2:10).</b> <br>“A river emerged from Eden to water the garden” – Rabbi Simon began: “You grant him power [<i>titkefehu</i>] forever, and he went; You alter his countenance and send him away” (Job 14:20) – the power [<i>tokef</i>] that the Holy One blessed be He gave to Adam the first man “forever” should have been for all time. “And he went” – because he forsook the directive of the Holy One blessed be He and went after the directive of the serpent, “You alter his countenance and send him away.” Rabbi Simon said: “Wisdom and might with Him” (Job 12:13)<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Two verses later: “Behold, He halts the water and it dries; He releases it, and they overturn the earth” (Job 12:15).</i> – when he [Adam] was still innocent vis-a-vis his Creator,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Before having sinned, when he was “with Him.”</i> he could unleash the water of four riverheads with a single spade.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">So great was his “wisdom and might.”</i> These are the four riverheads: “A river emerged from Eden to water the garden [and from there it parted and became four headwaters, etc.].”
“The name of the one is Pishon; it is that which encircles the entire land of Ḥavila, where the gold is” (Genesis 2:11).</b> <br>“The name of the one is Pishon” – because it causes flax [<i>pishtan</i>] to grow<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Pishon is interpreted to be the Nile, along which flax grows.</i> and its water flows smoothly [<i>shofi</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shofi </i>contains the first three letters of Pishon, transposed.</i>  <br>“It is that which encircles the entire land of Ḥavila” – Ḥavila did not yet exist,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ḥavila was a great-grandson of Noah (Genesis 10:7).</i> and yet you say: “It is that which encircles [the entire land of Ḥavila]”? This is bewildering. The explanation is that “He tells the outcome from the outset” (Isaiah 46:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">God knows the future, so He is able to call a land by its future name.</i> <br>“Where the gold is” – pure gold.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded from the fact that it says “the gold,” rather than “gold.”</i> <br><b>“And the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium there, and onyx stone” (Genesis 2:12).</b> <br>“And the gold of that land is good” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is good when it is in his house;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gold is the best way to store one’s savings, since a large value is concentrated in each coin. </i> it is good when it accompanies him on the road.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is convenient for the road as well, for the same reason. The Midrash is expounding the repeated use of the word “gold” in consecutive verses [<i>hazahav, vezahav</i>].</i> Rabbi Abahu said: The Holy One blessed be He afforded a great favor to His world, as a person makes change from a single gold piece and he can spend it on several expenditures. <br>Reish Lakish said: The world should not have been worthy of using gold [for secular purposes]. Why was it created? For the Temple, as it is stated: “And the gold of that land is good” – just as it says: “This good mountain and Lebanon” (Deuteronomy 3:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase refers to the Temple (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 15:1).</i>  <br>“There is bdellium [<i>bedolaḥ</i>] there, and onyx stone” – Rabbi Aivu said: Do you think that this <i>bedolaḥ</i> is the one that spice-mixers use?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bedolaḥ</i> is both the name of a spice and the name of a gem.</i> Let its counterpart tell about it: “And its appearance was like the appearance of bdellium [<i>bedolaḥ</i>]” (Numbers 11:7). Just as that is a gem, so, too, this is a gem.
<b>“And the name of the second river is Giḥon; it is that which encircles the entire land of Kush” (Genesis 2:13).</b> <br>“And the name of the second river is Giḥon…[the land of Kush]” – Kush did not yet exist,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Kush was a grandson of Noah (Genesis 10:6).</i> and it says: “The entire land of Kush”? This is bewildering. It is because, “He tells the outcome from the outset.” <br><b>“And the name of the third river is Tigris; it is that which goes east of Ashur.

But is it not written: “I was alongside the great river, that being Tigris”? (Daniel 10:4). The explanation is that Daniel saw two prophetic dreams, one on the Tigris and one on the Uval, and the [vision on the] Tigris was greater than [the vision on] the Uval, and that is why he calls it [Tigris] great. But is it not so, that at the creation of the world, it [Euphrates] is not called great? [Why is that?] The reason is because it went up and encircled the Land of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">At creation it was not yet “great.” Its greatness came later, when it became the border of the Land of Israel.</i> in whose regard it is written: “For who is a great nation that has God [close to it]” (Deuteronomy 4:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Euphrates is called “the great river” because of its association with the land of the “great nation.”</i> The folk saying says: A king’s slave is [himself] a king; attach yourself to an officer and people will bow to you. <br>Rav said to his son Ḥiyya: ‘Build me a house in the Land of Israel.’ He said to him: ‘Where?’ He said to him: ‘Build it as soon as you cross the River [Euphrates].’ Shmuel said: ‘Up to the place where the River flows, that is the Land of Israel.’ Where is that? It is Tarbakna.  <br>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Huna, Rabbi Yudan said: The Euphrates and the Kevar River (Ezekiel 1:1) are one and the same. “Euphrates [<i>Perat</i>]” – because it broadens [<i>para verava</i>] to the point that it can be crossed [only] by boat. “Euphrates [<i>Perat</i>]” – because its water brings fertility [<i>parin</i>] and abundance [to the surrounding soil]. “Euphrates [<i>Perat</i>]” – because it gradually branches out [<i>mefaresh</i>] [into smaller and smaller streams] until it is possible to stop it with a spade. Kevar – because its produce [its grains] are large and do not fall through a sieve [<i>kevara</i>]. Rabbi Huna said: Kevar is a river unto itself, and <i>Perat </i>is a river unto itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">They are not identical, as Rabbi Yehuda said.</i>  <br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: They said to the Euphrates: ‘Why do you not emit a loud sound?’ It responded to them: ‘I do not need [to show off], as my actions make me known: A person plants a sapling near me, and it produces [fruit] in just thirty days; he sows a vegetable near me, and it grows in just three days.’ They said to the Tigris: ‘Why do you emit a loud sound?’ It responded to them: ‘Would that my sound might be heard and I be noticed.’ <br>They said to the fruit trees: ‘Why do you not emit a loud sound?’<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Your leaves do not rustle loudly.</i> They responded to them: ‘We do not need [to show off], as our fruits attest to our [importance].’ They said to the non-fruit bearing trees: ‘Why do you emit a loud sound?’ They responded to them: ‘Would that our sound might be heard and we be noticed.’ <br>Rav Huna said: It is not for that reason. Rather, fruit trees, because they are weighed down with their fruit, that is why they do not emit a loud sound. But non-fruit bearing trees, because they are not weighed down with their fruit, do emit a loud sound. That is what is written: “His heart and the heart of his people trembled, like the trembling of the trees of the forest from [the wind]” (Isaiah 7:2).
Rabbi Tanḥum said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: In the future, the Holy One blessed be He will give the nations to drink from the cup of terror,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Drinking from the cup of terror is a metaphor for divine punishment (Isaiah 51:17, 51:22).</i> from the place from which justice [<i>hadin</i>] emerges. What is the source? “A river emerged from Eden [<i>eden</i>] to water the garden; and from there it parted” – “and became four rivers” is not written here, but rather, “and became four headwaters [<i>rashim</i>]”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rashim</i> can also mean rulers.</i> – these are the four kingdoms,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">That would ultimately subjugate Israel (see Daniel chapters 2 and 7).

Chapter 17

<b>“The Lord God said: It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make a helper for him alongside him” (Genesis 2:18).</b> <br>“The Lord God said: It is not good that [the man] should be” – we learned: The world was created with ten [divine] utterances.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 5:1.</i> These are: “In the beginning [God created the heavens and the earth]” (Genesis 1:1);<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although the words “God said” are not written here, it was through God’s command that the heavens and earth were created (see Psalms 33:6).</i> “the wind<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets the word <i>ruaḥ</i> to mean wind, unlike the more common translation, “spirit.”</i> of God hovered [over the surface of the water]” (Genesis 1:2);<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Here too, although the words “God said” are not written, it was through God’s command that the wind came about.</i> “God said: Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3); “God said: Let there be a firmament” (Genesis 1:6); “God said: “Let the water be gathered” (Genesis 1:9). “God said: Let the earth sprout [grass]” (Genesis 1:11). “God said: Let there be lights” (Genesis 1:14). “God said: Let the water swarm” (Genesis 1:20). “God said: “Let the earth produce” (Genesis 1:24). “God said: Let us make man” (Genesis 1:26). Menaḥem bar Yosei removes: “The wind of God hovered,” and inserts: “The Lord God said: It is not good that the man should be.” Rabbi Yaakov ben Kurshai said: A special utterance was devoted specifically to the wind.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yaakov concurs with the original count of the ten utterances.</i>
“It is not good” – Rabbi Yaakov taught: Anyone who does not have a wife is without good, without help, without joy, without blessing, without atonement. Without good – “it is not good that the man should be alone.” Without help – “I will make a helper for him alongside him.” Without joy – as it is stated: “You shall rejoice, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 14:26). Without atonement – “he shall atone for himself and for his household” (Leviticus 16:11). Without blessing – “to lay a blessing upon your house” (Ezekiel 44:30). <br>Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: He is also without peace, as it is stated: “You shall be in peace, and your household shall be in peace” (I Samuel 25:6). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: He is also without life, as it is stated: “Appreciate life with a woman whom you love” (Ecclesiastes 9:9). Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said: He is not even a complete man, as it is stated: “He blessed them, and He called their name Man, on the day they were created” (Genesis 5:2) – when both of them are together they are called “Man.” Some say he even diminishes the [divine] image, as it is stated: “As He made man in the image of God” (Genesis 9:6). What is written thereafter? “And you, be fruitful, and multiply” (Genesis 9:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A man’s being in the image of God is contingent upon marrying and producing offspring.</i>
“I will make a helper for him alongside him [<i>kenegdo</i>]” – if one merits, she [his wife] is a helper, but if not, she is against him [<i>kenegdo</i>]. Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya said: If he merits, [his wife will be] like the wife of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥakhinai, but if not, she will be like the wife of Rabbi Yosei the HaGelili. The wife of Rabbi Yosei [HaGelili] was malicious, though she was his sister’s daughter. She would humiliate him in the presence of his students. His students said: Be rid of that malicious wife<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Divorce her.</i> who does not respect you. He said to them: Her marriage contract is too large for me, and I do not have enough [money] to be rid of her. One time he and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya were sitting and studying. When they finished, he [Rabbi Yosei] said to him: ‘Rabbi, accept my suggestion, and let us go up to my house [to eat].’ He said to him: ‘Yes, let us go up.’ When he went up, she looked downward and walked out. He saw a pot and said to her: ‘Is there anything in that pot?’ She said to him: ‘There is only relish.’ He went and opened it and found pieces of chicken. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya realized what he had heard.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He realized that Rabbi Yosei and his wife had a difficult relationship.</i> They sat and ate. He said to him: ‘Rabbi, did she not say there was only relish?

He married a different wife, who was better than her.  <br>The sins of that women brought about that she went and married the city watchman. Some time later, he experienced suffering<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He contracted a disease.</i> and became blind. She would hold his hand and take him around the city streets.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To beg for charity.</i> When she reached the street of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, she stopped and turned back. Because that man knew well the [layout of the] city, he said to her: ‘Why did you not take me to the neighborhood of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, of whom I heard that he gives charity?’ She said to him: ‘I am his divorcée, and I cannot bear to see his face.’ <br>One time, they came and called<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">They sought charity.</i> in Rabbi Yosei’s neighborhood. He realized what she was doing<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He sensed that she was turning around.</i> on the first day and the second day, and then he began to hit her. Their voices were loud and audible, and they became disgraced throughout the city. Rabbi Yosei looked in the direction of their voices, and he saw them becoming disgraced in the streets. He said to him: ‘Why are you hitting her?’ He said to him: ‘Every day she causes me to lose the support [that I could take in] from this street.’ When Rabbi Yosei heard this, he took them and put them up in a house that he owned and supported them all the days of their lives, due to [the verse]: “Do not disregard your own flesh” (Isaiah 58:7).
<b>“The Lord God formed from the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call it; and whatever the man would call every living creature, that was its name” (Genesis 2:19).</b> <br>“The Lord God formed from the ground [every beast of the field]” – they raised a question before Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakai: It is written: “God said: Let the earth produce living creatures after their kinds” (Genesis 1:24). Why then does the verse state [here again]: “The Lord God formed [<i>vayitzer</i>] from the ground every beast of the field”? He said to them: There [the previous verse] it was referring to the creation [of the animals], and here it refers to domination,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">He claims that “<i>vayitzer”</i> does not mean “God formed” the animals, but that He placed them under man’s domination.</i> as it says: “When you besiege [<i>tatzur</i>] a city many days” (Deuteronomy 20:19). <br>Rabbi Aḥa said: When the Holy One blessed be He came to create man, He consulted with the ministering angels. He said to them: “Let us make man” (Genesis 1:26). They said to Him: ‘This man, what is his nature?’ He said to them: ‘His wisdom is greater than yours.’ He brought the animals, the beasts, and the birds before them and said to them: ‘What is its name of this one?’ And they did not know. He passed them before Adam and said to him: ‘What is the name of this one?’ He said: ‘This is an ox; this is a donkey; this is a horse; this is a camel.’ [He then asked:] ‘And you, what is your name?’ He said to Him: ‘It is appropriate that I be called Adam, as I was created from the ground [<i>adama</i>].’ [He asked further:] ‘And I, what is My name?’ He said to Him: ‘It is appropriate to call you my Lord [<i>adonai</i>], as You are the Lord [<i>adon</i>] over all your creatures.’ Rabbi Aḥa said: “I am the Lord, that is My name” (Isaiah 42:8) – that is My name that Adam the first man called Me. <br>He then passed them [the animals] before him in pairs. He [Adam] said: All of them have partners, but I do not have a partner – “and for the man, he did not find a helper to be alongside him” (Genesis 2:20). This is bewildering; why, in fact, did He not create her for him at the outset? The explanation is that the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that he [Adam] would complain about her in the future;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 3:12.</i> therefore, He did not create her until he requested her explicitly. After that, “the Lord God cast a deep slumber…” (Genesis 2:21).
<b>“The Lord God cast a deep slumber upon the man, and he slept. He took one of his sides, and He closed it with flesh in its place [<i>taḥtena</i>]” (Genesis 2:21).</b> <br>“The Lord God cast [<i>hipil</i>] a deep slumber” – Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The beginning of downfall [<i>mapala</i>] is sleep. When a person sleeps, he does not toil in Torah and does not do any work.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Too much sleep is a recipe for ruin. <i>Hipil</i> literally means, “He caused to fall down.”</i> <br>Rav said: There are three slumbers: the slumber of sleep, the slumber of prophecy, and the slumber of a trance. The slumber of sleep – “the Lord God cast a deep slumber upon the man, and he slept.” The slumber of prophecy – “it was when the sun was setting, and a deep slumber fell upon Abram” (Genesis 15:12). The slumber of a trance – “No one saw, and no one knew, and no one awoke, as they were all asleep, because a deep slumber from the Lord had fallen upon them” (I Samuel 26:12). The Rabbis said: There is also the slumber of foolishness, as it is written: “For the Lord poured upon you a spirit of deep slumber” (Isaiah 29:10). <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: There are three microcosms; sleep is a microcosm of death; a dream is a microcosm of prophecy; Shabbat is a microcosm of the World to Come. Rabbi Avin adds another two: The orb of the sun is a microcosm of the supernal light; Torah is a microcosm of the supernal wisdom.
“He took one of his sides [<i>mitzalotav</i>]”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mitzalotav</i> can mean either “one of his ribs” or “one of his sides.”</i> – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: “One of his sides” – as it says: “For the side [<i>tzela</i>] of the Tabernacle” (Exodus 26:20). Shmuel said: He took one rib from between two [other] ribs [<i>tzalotav</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mitzalotav</i> thus means “from the midst of his ribs.”</i> It is not written here, “in its place [<i>taḥteha</i>],” but rather, “in their place [<i>taḥtena</i>].” <br>Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rav Idi: From the beginning of the book until this point the letter <i>samekh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Here it appears in the word <i>vayisgor, </i>“and He closed it”.</i> is not written.

Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: <i>Vayaven </i>is written<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The letters of vayiven can also be read vayaven, He acted with thought.</i> – He contemplated [<i>hitbonen</i>] from where to create her.

But rather, [I will create her] from a place that is covered up in man,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash here follows the opinion found in Devarim Rabba (6:11), that Eve was created from the inside of Adam’s thigh.</i> as even when a person stands naked, that place is covered. Regarding each and every limb that He created for her, he said to her: ‘Be a modest woman, a modest woman.’ Nevertheless, [what happened was,] “You neglected all my counsel” (Proverbs 1:25). I did not create her from the head, yet she holds her head high, as it is stated: “They walk with outstretched necks” (Isaiah 3:16). Nor from the eye, yet she is excessively curious, as it is stated: “And they went with curious eyes” (Isaiah 3:16). Nor from the ear, yet she is an eavesdropper, as it is stated: “Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent” (Genesis 18:10). Nor from the heart, yet she is envious, as it is stated: “Rachel was jealous of her sister” (Genesis 30:1). Nor from the hand, yet she touches everything, as it is stated: “Rachel stole the household idols” (Genesis 31:19). Nor from the foot, yet she walks off, as it is stated: “Dina went out [to see the daughters of the land]” (Genesis 34:1).
Rav Ḥisda said: He built her to be more suitable to storage than a man, broad below and narrow above, so that she should be able to retain fetuses. <br>“And brought her to the man” – Rabbi Avin said: How fortunate is the villager for whom the king acts as groomsman.

<b>“The serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field that the Lord God had made. It said to the woman: Did God actually say: You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?” (Genesis 3:1).</b> <br>“The serpent was…cunning” – it is written: “For with great wisdom is great anger, and he who increases knowledge increases pain” (Ecclesiastes 1:18). By increasing wisdom a person increases anger against himself; by increasing knowledge he brings pain upon himself. Solomon said: Because I increased wisdom for myself I increased anger against myself, and because I increased my knowledge I brought pain upon myself.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">It is because Solomon was so wise that he became overconfident and transgressed (see <i>Bamidbar Rabba</i> 10:4).</i> Have you ever heard anyone say: ‘This donkey is afflicted by a cold?’ [Or:] ‘So many inflammations afflict him.’ [Of course not.] Where is suffering found?

The food is too much for this one, but it is not too much for that one. It is taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: The downfall of the serpent was in accordance with its greatness – The more cunning, the more cursed. <br>Rabbi Hoshaya Rabba said: It [the serpent]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Before it was punished and reduced to its current form.</i> stood erect like a reed, and it had legs. Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: It was a heretic.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It said blasphemous things about God (Genesis 3:4–5).</i> <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: It was like a camel.

“It said to the woman: Did [<i>af</i>] God actually say…” – Rabbi Ḥanina ben Sansan said: There are four people who began a statement with <i>af </i>and perished by [divine] wrath [<i>af</i>], and they are: The serpent, the baker [in prison with Joseph], the congregation of Koraḥ, and Haman. The serpent – “It said to the woman: Did [<i>af</i>] God actually say…” The baker – “I, too [<i>af</i>], in my dream…” (Genesis 40:16). The congregation of Koraḥ – “Moreover, [<i>af</i>] not to a land…” (Numbers 16:14). Haman – “Moreover, [<i>af</i>] Esther did not bring…” (Esther 5:12).

Vegetation was created on the third day and the luminaries on the fourth – do they [the luminaries] not cause its [the earth’s] produce to grow?

<b>“The woman saw that the tree was good for eating, and that it was an enticement to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable as a source of wisdom; she took from its fruit and ate; she also gave to her husband with her, and he ate” (Genesis 3:6).</b> <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Zimra said: Three matters were stated regarding that tree: That it was good for eating, pleasing to the eye, and suited for increasing wisdom” – and the three of them were stated in one verse. “The woman saw that…was good” – from here we learn that it was good; “and that it was an enticement to the eyes” – from here we learn that it was pleasing to the eye; “and that the tree was desirable as a source of wisdom [<i>lehaskil</i>]” – from here we learn that it was suitable for increasing wisdom, just as it says: “A contemplation [<i>maskil</i>] by Eitan the Ezrahite” (Psalms 89:1). <br>“She took from its fruit and ate” – Rabbi Aivu said: She squeezed grapes<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from the expression, “she took from its fruit,“ rather than she took its fruit.</i> and gave it to him [Adam].

<b>“They heard the voice of the Lord God moving about in the garden with the day breeze; the man and his wife hid from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden” (Genesis 3:8).</b> <br>“They heard the voice of the Lord God moving about [<i>mithalekh</i>] in the garden with the day breeze” – Rabbi Ḥalfon said: We have heard that walking about [<i>hilukh</i>] is [an expression] used regarding sound,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Even though “walking about” would seem to be appropriate only for people.</i> as it is stated: “They heard the voice of the Lord God moving about [<i>mithalekh</i>] in the garden,” and that walking about is used regarding fire, as it is stated: “And fire went [<i>vatihalakh</i>] earthward” (Exodus 9:23). <br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: <i>Mehalekh </i>is not written here, but rather, <i>mithalekh</i>, [which connotes] leaping up and ascending.

Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “The righteous will inherit the earth [and dwell [<i>veyishkenu</i>] upon it forever…” (Psalms 37:29). And what of the wicked, will they float in the air?

Chapter 20

<b>“The Lord God said to the serpent: Because you did this, cursed are you from all the animals, and from all the beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life” (Genesis 3:14).</b> <br>“The Lord God said to the serpent” – “The slanderer shall not stand in the land; [may evil trap unjust men, bringing about banishments]” (Psalms 140:12) – Rabbi Levi said: In the Messianic future the Holy One blessed be He will take the idolaters and send them down to Gehenna, and say to them: ‘Why did you punish my children?’ They will say to Him: ‘It is from them themselves, as they would come and slander one another.’ The Holy One blessed be He will then take both these and those<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The idolaters and the Jewish slanderers.</i> and send them down to Gehenna.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These are the banishments (plural) mentioned in the verse.</i> <br>Another matter, “The slanderer” – this is the serpent who slandered his Creator. “Shall not stand in the land” – “on your belly [you shall go].” “May evil trap unjust men [bringing about banishments]” – “banishment” is not written here, but rather, <i> </i>“banishments.”<i> </i>Adam was cursed, Eve was cursed, and the serpent was cursed.
“The Lord God said to the serpent: Because you did this…” – “A contrary man incites strife, and a malcontent distances the ruler” (Proverbs 16:28). “A contrary man” – this is the serpent who stated contrary matters about His Creator. “And a malcontent” – as it voiced grievances against its Creator, saying [to the woman:] “You will not die” (Genesis 3:4). “Distances the ruler” – as it alienated the Ruler of the world, and was immediately cursed. <br>“The Lord God said to the serpent…” – with Adam He had a discussion,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Before cursing him.</i> with Eve He had a discussion, but with the serpent, He did not have any discussion. Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘This serpent is a wicked one, with all the answers. If I say something to it, now it will say to me: You commanded them, and I commanded them. Why did they forsake your command and follow my command?’ Instead, He summarily issued his sentence.
“The Lord God said to the serpent: Because you did this…” – Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: When it comes to showing honor, one begins with the greatest one, but when it comes to disgrace, one begins with the lesser one. When it comes to showing honor, one begins with the greatest one, as it is stated: “Moses said to Aaron, to Elazar, and to Itamar” (Leviticus 10:6). When it comes to disgrace, one begins with the lesser one, as it is stated: “The Lord God said to the serpent,” [then] “to the woman He said: I will increase your suffering and your pregnancy” (Genesis 3:16), [then] “to Adam, He said: Because you heeded your wife’s voice” (Genesis 3:17). It teaches that initially the serpent was cursed, then Eve was cursed, and then Adam was cursed. <br>All creatures cohabit front facing back, with the exception of two who mate back to back, and they are the camel and the dog, and with the exception of three who mate face to face because the Divine Presence spoke to them. These are: man, the serpent, and the fish. Man, as it is stated: “To Adam, He said: Because you heeded your wife’s voice” (Genesis 3:17); the serpent – “the Lord God said to the serpent” (Genesis 3:14); the fish – “The Lord said to the fish, and it spewed Jonah” (Jonah 2:11).

Why, then, was it necessary to state the lesser curse after already having stated the more severe one? Large domesticated animals give birth after nine or twelve months of gestation, whereas wild animals give birth after only six months (see later). This shows that animals are worse off than beasts.</i> It was taught: A large kosher animal gives birth after nine months [of gestation], a large non-kosher animal gives birth after twelve months; a small kosher animal gives birth at five months, and the dog at fifty days, the cat at fifty-two, the pig at sixty days, the mongoose at seventy days, the deer and the fox at six months, and all the other swarming creatures at six months, the lion, the bear, the tiger, the elephant, the monkey, the hedgehog at three years, the serpent at seven years, and the adder at seventy years.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">There are thus beasts that are in fact worse off (in length of gestation) than animals.</i>  <br>A certain scholar once sought to ascertain after how long the serpent bears an offspring. When he saw them mating with one another, he took them<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The females.</i> and placed them in a barrel, and provided them with sustenance until they gave birth. When the elders once traveled to Rome, he [the scholar] asked Rabban Gamliel: After how long does the serpent bear an offspring? He was unable to answer him and his face turned pallid. Rabbi Yehoshua encountered him and his face was sickly. He said to him: ‘Why is your face sickly?’ He said to him: ‘I was asked a question and I was unable to answer it.’ He said to him: ‘What was it?’ He said: ‘After how long does the serpent bear an offspring?’ He said to him: ‘After seven years.’ He said to him: ‘From where do you know this?’ He said to him: ‘The dog is a non-kosher beast and bears offspring after fifty days. A non-kosher animal gives birth at twelve months. It says [of the serpent]: “Cursed are you from all the animals and from all the beasts of the field.” Just as the animal is seven times more cursed than the beast [dog], so, the serpent is seven times more cursed than the animal.’ Towards evening, he [Rabban Gamliel] ascended and said it to him [the scholar]. He began banging his head against the wall. He said: ‘After everything that I toiled for seven years, this man comes and presented it to me with a reed.’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That is, effortlessly.</i>
“On your belly you shall go” – when the Holy One blessed be He said to it: “On your belly you shall go,” the ministering angels descended and severed its arms and its legs, and its voice carried from the end of the world to its end.

The serpent, as it is stated [of the Messianic future]: “A serpent, dust will be its food. None will harm or destroy [on the entire mountain of My holiness]” (Isaiah 65:25). The Givonites – “the workers of the city<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Givonites were condemned to be eternal servants for public needs (Joshua 9:23).</i> from all the tribes of Israel will cultivate it” (Ezekiel 48:19). <br>Rabbi Asi and Rabbi Hoshaya said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The Holy One blessed be He said to it [the serpent]: ‘I made you king over animal and beast, but you did not want it.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">So now, “cursed are you from all the animals, and from all the beasts.”</i> I made you such that you would walk upright like man, but you did not want it; now, “on your belly you shall go.” I made you such that you would eat food like man, but you did not want it; now, “you shall eat dust all the days of your life.” You sought to kill Adam and to marry Eve; so “I will place enmity between you and the woman”’ (Genesis 3:15). That is, what it sought was not given to it, and what had been in its possession was taken from it. We find likewise regarding Cain, Koraḥ, Bilam, Doeg, Aḥitofel, Geiḥazi, Absalom, Adoniyahu, Uziyahu, and Haman.

Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon said: It is easier for a man to support an entire legion with olives in the Galilee, than it is to raise one child in the Land of Israel.
“And your desire shall be for your husband” – there are four desires. The desire of a woman is only for her husband, as it is stated: “And your desire shall be for your husband.” The desire of the evil inclination is only for Cain and his counterparts, as it is stated: “[Sin crouches at the entrance,] and its desire is for you” (Genesis 4:7). The desire of rain is only for the ground, as it is stated: “You remember the earth and fulfill its desire…[the streams of God are full of water]” (Psalms 65:10). The desire of the Holy One blessed be He is only for Israel, as it is stated: “His desire is for me” (Song of Songs 7:11). <br>Another matter, “his desire [<i>teshukato</i>] [is for me]” – we are exhausted [<i>tashim</i>], but even though we are exhausted, we hope [<i>mekavim</i>] for the salvation of the Holy One blessed be He, and we declare the unity of His name each day. <br>Another matter, “and your desire shall be for your husband” – when a woman is sitting on the birthing stool, she says: ‘I will never be intimate with my husband anymore.’ But the Holy One blessed be He says to her: ‘You will return to your desire, you will return to desiring your husband.’ Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Because her<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the woman who has just given birth.</i> heart fluttered, that is why she brings a fluttering offering – two turtledoves or two young pigeons.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Leviticus 12:8.</i>  <br>“And he shall rule over you” – Rabbi Yosei HaGelili said: One might think that this means dominion in every sense.

<b>“And to Adam He said: Because you heeded your wife’s voice, and ate from the tree that I commanded you, saying: You shall not eat from it, the ground is cursed on your account; in suffering you shall eat of it all the days of your life” (Genesis 3:17).</b> <br>“And to Adam He said: Because you heeded your wife’s voice” – Rabbi Simlai said: She approached him persuasively. She said to him: ‘What do you think, that I will die and another Eve will be created for you? “There is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). What do you think, that I will die and you will sit alone? “He did not create it for emptiness; He formed it to be inhabited”’ (Isaiah 45:18). The Rabbis say: She began sobbing at him with her voice. That is what is written: “And to Adam He said...” “Because you heeded your wife’s words” is not written here, but rather, “your wife’s voice.”  <br>“And ate of the tree” – this supports what Rabbi Abba of Akko said, that it [the tree of knowledge] was a citron tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The taste of the citron tree is similar to its fruit.

“In suffering you shall eat of it” – Rav Asi said: Earning a livelihood is twice as difficult as childbirth.

Just as redemption is miraculous, so, too, earning a livelihood is miraculous. Just as earning a livelihood is every day, so, too, redemption is every day. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It [earning a livelihood] is even greater than redemption, as redemption is carried out through an angel, but livelihood is [directly] through the Holy One blessed be He. Redemption is carried out through an angel, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The angel who redeems me from all evil” (Genesis 48:16). That livelihood is through the Holy One blessed be He? As it is stated: “You open Your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing” (Psalms 145:16). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It [earning a livelihood] is greater than the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated: “Who split apart the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:13), and it says: “He gives food to all flesh…” (Psalms 136:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Giving food to all flesh is mentioned after the splitting of the Red Sea, indicating that it is greater.</i>

“Though his exaltedness ascends to the heavens, and his head reaches the clouds” (Job 20:6) – “though his exaltedness ascends to the heavens” – his stature; “and his head reaches the clouds” – until it reaches the clouds. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: He created him [Adam] filling the entire world from east to west, as it is stated: “Back and front You shaped me” (Psalms 139:5). From north to south, from where is it derived? “[From the day God made Adam on the earth,] and from one end of the heavens to the other end” (Deuteronomy 4:32). From where is it derived that he even filled the space of the world? The verse states: “You placed Your palm upon me” (Psalms 139:5). “He will perish forever like his dung [<i>kegelelo</i>]” (Job 20:7) – because he rolled away [<i>galal</i>] a minor commandment, he was expelled from the garden of Eden. “They who saw him will say: Where is he?” (Job 20:7) – that is Adam. When He sent him away, He began lamenting over him and saying: “Behold, the man…”
“You grant him power forever, and he is gone; You alter his countenance and send him away” (Job 14:20) – the power that the Holy One blessed be He gave to Adam the first man was “forever” – it was eternal. But once he forsook the mindset of the Holy One blessed be He and followed the mindset of the serpent – “alter his countenance and send him away.” When He sent him away, He began lamenting over him: “The Lord God said: Behold, the man was as one of us.”

“And now, he might extend his hand” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: This teaches that the Holy One blessed be He opened for him an opportunity for repentance. “And now” – “and now” is nothing other than repentance, as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God [ask of you? Only to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways…]” (Deuteronomy 10:12). But he [Adam] said: “Might [<i>pen</i>]” – and <i>pen </i>is nothing other than no. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Will he now extend his hand and eat from the tree of life?’ It was a rhetorical question. And if he eats, he will live forever.

The following supports Rabbi Neḥemya: “I, in justice [<i>betzedek</i>], will see Your face; Your image will fill my waking vision” (Psalms 17:15). When the one who was created in Your image awakens, at that moment, “I, in justice [<i>betzedek</i>], will see Your face” – at that moment I will exonerate him from that decree. At that moment, “behold, the man has become as one of us.” <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When He created him, He created him through the attribute of justice and the attribute of mercy, and when He expelled him, He expelled him through the attribute of justice and the attribute of mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Concerning both Adam’s creation and his banishment, God is referred to as “<i>Hashem Elohim</i>,” indicating His attribute of mercy and His attribute of strict justice.</i> <br>“<i>Hen</i> <i>haadam</i>” – O Adam [<i>hah haadam</i>], were you unable to observe your command for even one hour?

<b>“He banished the man; He stationed the cherubs east of the Garden of Eden, and the flame of the ever-turning sword, to guard the path of the tree of life” (Genesis 3:24).</b> <br>“He banished [<i>vaygaresh</i>] the man” – Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Like a priest’s daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Who married a priest.</i> who was divorced [<i>nitgarsha</i>] and cannot return.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">She cannot return to her husband because it is prohibited for a priest to marry a divorcee.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Like an Israelite’s daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Who married an Israelite.</i> who was divorced and can return. According to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, He dealt with him harshly. According to Reish Lakish’s opinion, He dealt with him mercifully. <br>Another matter, “He banished” – He showed him the destruction of the Temple, just as it says: “He has ground [<i>vayagres</i>] my teeth with gravel” (Lamentations 3:16). <br>Rabbi Luleyani bar Tavri said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: He banished him to an empty field [<i>migrash</i>] adjacent to Eden and deployed guards there to guard it. That is what is written: “I will command the clouds from pouring rain upon it” (Isaiah 5:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">That passage deals with God’s disappointment with Israel, who is compared to a derelict vineyard. This reflects God’s disappointment with Adam, and the need to post guards to keep him from returning to the Garden.</i>
“East” – Rav said: In every place, the eastern direction offers refuge. Adam the first man – “He banished the man; He stationed the cherubs east of the Garden of Eden.” Cain – “Cain departed from the presence of the Lord, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden” (Genesis 4:16). The killer – “Then, Moses designated three cities on the eastern side of the Jordan [that a killer may flee there who kills his neighbor unwittingly]” (Deuteronomy 4:41–42). <br>Another matter, “[He stationed the cherubs] east [<i>mikedem</i>] [of the Garden of Eden]” – the angels were created before [<i>kodem</i>] the Garden of Eden.

Adam said: ‘Who will save my descendants from this fire?’ Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Abba: The sword of circumcision, as it is stated: “Make flint swords for yourself [and circumcise the children of Israel]” (Joshua 5:2). The Rabbis say: The sword of Torah, as it is stated: “And a double-edged sword in their hand” (Psalms 149:6). When Adam saw that his descendants were destined to descend to Gehenna, he restrained himself from procreation. But when he saw that after twenty-six generations Israel was destined to receive the Torah, He consorted in order to produce descendants, as it is stated: “The man was intimate with Eve, his wife” (Genesis 4:1).

Chapter 22

“And the man was intimate with Eve his wife and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and said: I have acquired a man with the Lord” (Genesis 4:1). <br>And the man was intimate with Eve his wife” – “Remember, Lord, Your mercy and kindness, for they are eternal” (Psalms 25:6). They are not from now, but rather, they are eternal. Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya said: With them You conducted Yourself with Adam the first man, as You said to him: “As on the day that you eat of it you shall die” (Genesis 2:17).

They are: Cain – “a cultivator of the land”; Noah – “Noah, man of the soil, began …” (Genesis 9:20); Uziyahu – “He had farmers and viticulturists in the mountains and on the fertile lands, as he was a lover of the soil” (II Chronicles 26:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cain became a murderer; Noah, a drunkard; and Uziyahu, a leper.</i>

Something that was a new concept. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: This verse supports Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering: that is the burnt offering” (Leviticus 6:2) – which the descendants of Noah used to sacrifice. But when it comes to the peace offering: “This is the law of the peace offering that one will sacrifice to the Lord” (Leviticus 7:11) – “that they sacrificed” is not written here, but rather, “that one will sacrifice”; from here on.

<b>“Cain was intimate with his wife and she conceived, and gave birth to Ḥanokh; he was the builder of a city, and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Ḥanokh” (Genesis 4:17).</b> <br>“Cain was intimate with his wife.” “Their houses will endure in their midst forever” (Psalms 49:12). Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Pinḥas, Rabbi Yudan said: What do the wicked believe? “Their houses will endure in their midst forever…they name their lands after themselves” (Psalms 49:12); Tiberias after Tiberius, Alexandria after Alexander, Antioch after Antiochus. Rabbi Pinḥas said: “Their houses will endure in their midst (<i>kirbam</i>) forever”; tomorrow their house will become their graves (<i>kivram</i>). “Their abodes will remain for all generations” (Psalms 49:12), as they will neither live nor be judged [at the resurrection].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The grave will be their “abode for all generations.”</i> Moreover, “they name their lands after themselves” – “he was the builder of a city, and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Ḥanokh.”

Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: This is what the people of the generation of the Flood would do: Each one would take two wives for himself, one for procreation and one for intercourse. The one that was designated for procreation would sit as though she were a widow in her lifetime [variant reading: in the life of her husband]. The one that was designated for intercourse, he would give her a sterility potion so she would not bear children, and she would sit by him adorned like a harlot. That is what is written: “He consorts with the barren who will not give birth, and to the widow he will do no good” (Job 24:21). You may know that it is so, as Lemekh was the most outstanding among them and he took two wives. That is what is written: “Lemekh took for himself two wives; the name of one was Ada” – as she was removed [<i>ada</i>] from him; “and the name of the other Tzila” – as she was sitting in his shadow [<i>tzilo</i>].
<b>“Ada bore Yaval; he was the forerunner of those who dwell in tents and raise livestock (<i>mikneh</i>).

<b>“Lemekh said to his wives, Ada and Tzila: Hear my voice, wives of Lemekh, listen to my speech, for have I slain a man for my wound or a child for my injury?” (Genesis 4:23)</b> <br>“Lemekh said to his wives, Ada and Tzila: Hear my voice.” Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: He propositioned them for intercourse, but they said to him: ‘Tomorrow the Flood is coming [to destroy all mankind].

When he heard this, he consorted [with Eve] to produce offspring.
<b>“Adam was further intimate with his wife and she gave birth to a son, and she called his name Seth: As God has provided me with another offspring in place of Abel, as Cain killed him” (Genesis 4:25).</b> <br>“Adam was further intimate with his wife,” extra desire was added for him to his desire. In the past, when he did not see her, he would not desire her. Now, whether he saw her or did not see her, he desired her. <br>Rabbi Abba bar Yudan in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: This is an allusion for seafarers, that they will eventually remember their homes and come immediately. <br>“She called his name Seth [<i>Shet</i>]: As God has provided [<i>shat</i>] me with another offspring.” Rabbi Tanḥuma said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: She was looking ahead at that offspring who would come from a different place.

Chapter 24

<b>“This is the book of the descendants of Adam, on the day that God created man, in the likeness of God He made him” (Genesis 5:1).</b> <br>“This is the book of the descendants of Adam.” Rabbi Yehoshua Rabba began: “Woe, those who go deep from the Lord to conceal counsel, and their actions are in the dark, and they say: who sees us and who knows of us?” (Isaiah 29:15). This is analogous to an architect who designed a city – its chambers, sewers, and cisterns. Sometime later, he became a tax collector. The residents of the city would conceal themselves from him in the chambers and in the cisterns. He said to them: It is I who built the cisterns! How can you conceal yourselves in them? So, “Woe, those who go deep from the Lord to conceal counsel, and their actions are in the dark.” “In your contrariness you assert that the potter is just like the clay” (Isaiah 29:16) – they liken the product to the craftsman, the plant to the planter. “Can a product say of its maker: ‘He did not make me,’ or the craft say of its craftsman: ‘He does not understand’?” (Isaiah 29:16). “Behold, in just a short while Lebanon<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A forest of mighty, but barren, cedars.</i> will be transformed into farmland” (Isaiah 29:17) – into a royal palace;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">God will aggrandize the meek. This will disprove the assertion of the wicked that they can conceal their deeds from God, that He is indifferent to man’s actions.</i> “and the farmland will be considered a forest” (Isaiah 29:17) – into forests of men. “On that day, the deaf will hear the words of a book” (Isaiah 29:18) – “this is the book of the descendants of Adam.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">God is the Creator of Adam and all mankind, so he surely knows their thoughts and deeds.</i>
Another matter, “this is the book of the descendants of Adam,” it is written: “Your eyes saw my unformed parts, and in Your book they were all written. Of the days that were created, each one is His” (Psalms 139:16). Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya and Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: When the Holy One blessed be He created Adam the first man, He created him [so large as to be] filling the whole world. From east to west, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “From back [<i>aḥor</i>] and front [<i>kedem</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aḥor</i> and <i>kedem</i> can also mean “west” and “east.”</i> You shaped me” (Psalms 139:5). From north to south, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “[From the day God made Adam on the earth,] and from one end of the heavens to the other end” (Deuteronomy 4:32). From where is it derived that he even filled the empty space of the world? It is as it is stated: “You placed Your palm upon me” (Psalms 139:5). <br>Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Benaya, and Rabbi Benaya and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Elazar, said: He created him unformed and he was placed from the end of the world to its end. That is what is written: “Your eyes saw my unformed parts” (Psalms 139:16). Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: While Adam the first man was placed unformed before Him who spoke and the world came into being, He showed him each and every generation and its scholars, each and every generation and its wise men, each and every generation and its interpreters of the Torah, each and every generation and its leaders, as it is stated: “Your eyes saw my unformed parts, [and in Your book they were all written]” – the unformed ones whom Your eyes saw, they were already written in the book of Adam the first man. That is, “this is the book of the descendants of Adam.”
Bar Kappara began: [David said of the wicked:] “May they be expunged from the book of life; and not be inscribed with the righteous” (Psalms 69:29). “May they be expunged from the book of life” – from the book of descendants on earth; “and not be inscribed with the righteous” – from the book of descendants on High.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In the world to come.</i> Bar Kappara taught: Everywhere that “lived” is stated, it is in reference to a righteous man: “Arpakhshad lived [<i>ḥai</i>]” (Genesis 11:12); “Shelaḥ lived [<i>ḥai</i>]” (Genesis 11:14). Another interpretation, “may they be expunged from the book of life” – from “the book of the descendants of Adam.”
Another matter, “this is the book of the descendants of Adam,” it is written: “For I [God] will not contend forever” (Isaiah 57:16) – with Adam the first man; “and I will not be eternally angry” (Isaiah 57:16) – with his descendants. “For the wind will be faint [<i>yaatof</i>] before Me” (Isaiah 57:16), Rabbi Huna said: This wind, when it goes out into the world it seeks to destroy the world, but the Holy One blessed be He weakens it on the mountains, breaks it on the hills, and says to it: ‘Take care that you do not harm My creations!’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is alluded to in the concluding words of the Isaiah verse (57:16): “And the souls that I have created.”</i> What is the source? “For the wind will be faint [<i>yaatof</i>] before Me.” What is <i>yaatof</i>? It means that He wears it down, as it says: “When my soul was worn down [<i>behitatef</i>] within me, I remembered the Lord” (Jonah 2:8). <br>Rabbi Huna said: There were three winds that, because they emerged untamed, the world was almost destroyed by them. They were: one in the days of Jonah, one in the days of Job, and one in the days of Elijah. Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Yishmael said: Jonah’s [wind] was on that ship [alone], as it is stated: “But the Lord cast a great wind upon the sea” (Jonah 1:4). Job’s was on that house [alone], as it is stated: “And behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness, [and it struck the four corners of the house]” (Job 1:19). You have only Elijah’s that was worldwide, as it is stated: “And behold, the Lord was passing, and there was a great and powerful wind, smashing mountains and shattering rocks” (I Kings 19:11). <br>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya, and some say it in the name of the Rabbis: The messianic king will not come<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is a new interpretation of <i>ruaḥ</i> not as “wind,” but as “the spirit [of the Messiah].” It will not go forth (<i>yaatof</i>) from before God until the depletion of “the souls that I have created.”</i> until all the souls that entered God’s mind to be created are created, and those are the souls stated in the book of Adam.
Another matter, “this is the book of the descendants of Adam.” It is written: “Then He saw and assessed it” (Job 28:27). the Rabbis and Rabbi Aḥa, the Rabbis say: Each and every statement that the Holy One blessed be He would say to Moses, He would say it twice in His heart and then would say it to Moses. What is the source? “Then He saw and assessed it” – one; “prepared it, and also investigated it” (Job 28:27) – another one, and only then: “He said to the man” (Job 28:28) – this is Moses. Rabbi Aḥa said: Four times – “Then He saw” – one; “and assessed it” – another one; “prepared it” – another one; “and also investigated it” – another one, and only then: “He said to the man” – this is Moses. <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Adam the first man was worthy to have had the Torah given through him.

I am not giving it to Adam, but rather to his descendants,’ as it is stated: “This is the book of the descendants of Adam.” <br>Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanin said: Adam the first man was worthy of having the twelve tribes emerge from him. What is the source? “This [<i>zeh</i>] is the book of the descendants of Adam.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I gave him two sons and one arose and killed the other; how can I give him twelve sons?’ “He said to man [<i>laAdam</i>]” (Job 28:28) – not to Adam<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>LaAdam </i>is an acronym for <i>lo</i> <i>Adam </i>–<i> </i>not Adam.</i> will I give it, but rather to his descendants.

Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Elazar, and Rabbi Menaḥem in the name of Rav said: Adam the first man learned all the crafts [in the world].

This is the basic tenet upon which the rest of the Torah is based.</i> Rabbi Akiva says: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18) – that verse represents the central tenet of the Torah, [as it teaches] that you should not say: Since I have been disparaged, let someone else be disparaged along with me; since I was cursed, let someone else be cursed along with me. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: If you do act like that, know who it is that you are disgracing: “in the likeness of God He made him” (Genesis 5:1).

<b>“Ḥanokh walked with God, and he was no longer, as God took him” (Genesis 5:24).</b> <br>“Ḥanokh walked with God, and he was no longer, as God took him,” Rabbi Ḥama bar Hoshaya said: He is not written in the ledger of the righteous, but rather, in the ledger of the wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Ḥama interprets the verse to be saying that initially, Ḥanokh walked with God, but did so no longer.</i> <br>Rabbi Aivu said: Ḥanokh was capricious; sometimes righteous, sometimes wicked.

<b>“He called his name Noah, saying: This one will comfort us from our work and from the misery of our hands, from the ground, which the Lord cursed” (Genesis 5:29).</b> <br>“He called his name Noah, saying,” Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The interpretation does not correspond to the name and the name does not correspond to the interpretation. It should have said instead: ‘Noah, this one will give us rest [<i>yaniḥenu</i>],’ or ‘Naḥman, this one will comfort us [<i>yenaḥamenu</i>].’ However, when the Holy One blessed be He created Adam the first man, He gave him control over everything; the cow would heed the plowman and [even] the furrow would heed the plowman. When Adam sinned, they rebelled against him; the cow did not heed the plowman and the furrow did not heed the plowman. When Noah appeared, they abstained<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From their rebellion.</i> [<i>naḥu</i>]. From where is that derived? Rest [<i>neyaḥa</i>] is stated here and elsewhere it is stated: “So that your ox and your donkey will rest [<i>yanuaḥ</i>]” (Exodus 23:12). Just as <i>neyaḥa </i>that is stated there refers to the resting of an ox, so, too, <i>neyaḥa</i> that is stated here refers to the resting of an ox. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The name does not correspond with the interpretation and interpretation does not correspond with the name. It should have said instead: ‘Noah, this one will give us rest [<i>yaniḥenu</i>],’ or ‘Naḥman, this one will comfort us [<i>yenaḥamenu</i>].’ However, until Noah appeared, the water would rise and inundate them in their graves. “Who calls the water of the sea” is written twice (Amos 5:8; 9:6) corresponding to the two times that the water would rise and inundate them in their graves, once in the morning and once in the evening. That is what is written: “Like corpses lying in the grave” (Psalms 88:6) – those of them who were lying were desecrated. When Noah appeared, they rested [in their graves]. Rest [<i>neyaḥa</i>] is stated here and elsewhere it is stated: “May he depart in peace…may they rest [<i>yanuḥu</i>] upon their resting places” (Isaiah 57:2). Just as <i>neyaḥa </i>that is stated there refers to the rest of the grave, so, too, <i>neyaḥa</i> that is stated here refers to the rest of the grave. <br>Rabbi Eliezer said: He was called after the name of his offering, as it is stated: “The Lord smelled the pleasing [<i>niḥoaḥ</i>] aroma” (Genesis 8:21). Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: He was called for the name of the resting of the ark, as it is written: “The ark rested [<i>vatanaḥ</i>]” (Genesis 8:4). <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The constellations did not function all those twelve months [of the Flood].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He was called Noah because the constellations ‘rested’ from their function in his day.</i> Rabbi Yonatan said to him: They functioned, but their effect was imperceptible. <br>“[All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day] will not cease” (Genesis 8:22), Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer said: “Will not cease” – from here we learn that they did not cease [during the Flood]. Rabbi Eliezer said: “Will not cease” – [on the contrary,] from here we learn that they did cease.
“From the ground, which the Lord cursed” – there were ten periods of famine that came to the world: One in the days of Adam the first man, as it is stated: “Cursed is the ground on your account” (Genesis 3:17); one in the days of Lemekh, as it is stated: “From the ground, which the Lord cursed”; one in the days of Abraham – “there was a famine in the land” (Genesis 12:10); one in the days of Isaac, as it is stated: “There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine” (Genesis 26:1); one in the days of Jacob, as it is stated: “For these two years, the famine” (Genesis 45:6); one in the days when the judges judged, as it is stated: “It was in the days when the judges judged; there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1); one in the days of David, as it is stated: “There was a famine in the days of David for three years” (II Samuel 21:1); one in the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “As the Lord, God of Israel, before whom I stand, lives, there will be dew and rain during these years only by my word” (I Kings 17:1); one in the days of Elisha, as it is stated: “There was a great famine in Samaria” (II Kings 6:25); and there is one that circulates and comes periodically to the world. And [there will be] one more in the future, as it is stated: “Not a famine for bread, and not a thirst for water, but rather, to hear the words of the Lord” (Amos 8:11). <br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: In reality, it [David’s famine] should not have occurred in the days of David, but rather, in the days of Saul.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The reason underlying the famine was relevant to Saul, not David (II Samuel 21:1).</i> However, because Saul was the shoot of a sycamore,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Easily broken, unable to withstand it, due to his lack of merit.</i> the Holy One blessed be He postponed it and brought it about in the days of David. They say a parable: Shilo sinned, but Yoḥana pays?! That is astonishing! Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: This is analogous to a glazier who had in his hand a basket filled with goblets and cut glass. When he would wish to hang his basket, he would [first] bring a peg, affix it, and suspend himself from it, and only then would he hang his basket. That is why they did not come in the days of downtrodden people, but rather, in the days of powerful people, who are able to withstand them. Rabbi Berekhya would cite this verse in their regard: “He gives strength to the weary” (Isaiah 40:29). <br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: There were two [famines] that occurred in the days of Abraham. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: One was in the days of Lemekh, and one in the days of Abraham. <br>The famine that came in the days of Elijah was a famine of drought; one year produced [crops], and one year did not produce. The famine that came in the days of Elisha was a famine of panic, as it is stated: “Until the head of a donkey was sold for eighty silver pieces” (II Kings 6:25). The famine that was in the days that the judges judged, Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Dosa: For the price for which one used to purchase forty-two <i>se’a</i>, they could purchase [only] forty-one.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to a different reading: the price for which one used to purchase two <i>se’a</i>, they could purchase [only] one.</i> But is it not taught: A person should not depart and go outside the Land of Israel unless two <i>se’a </i> of wheat sells for one <i>sela</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Double the ordinary price of wheat, which was four <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela </i>(<i>Pe’a</i> 8:7).</i> Rabbi Shimon said: That is only when he does not find any [wheat] to buy, but if he can find to buy, even if it is one <i>se’a </i>for a <i>sela</i>, one should not depart and go outside the Land of Israel. But Elimelekh did depart, therefore, he was punished.

Chapter 26

<b>“Noah was five hundred years old and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Yefet” (Genesis 5:32).</b> <br>“Noah was five hundred years old” – it is written: “Happy is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked” (Psalms 1:1). “Happy is the man” – this is Noah. “Who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, has not stood in the path of sinners [and has not sat in the company of scoffers]” (Psalms 1:1), Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: In three generations – in the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and the generation of the Dispersion.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Noah resisted the influence of those generations and remained righteous. This is alluded to in the three expressions of resistance to sin in the Psalms verse.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya says: In the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion, but as for the generation of Enosh, he was still a minor.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Noah was eighty-four years old when Enosh died, and with life expectancy in those days approaching one thousand, people were not considered accountable until they were one hundred years old (see next section). </i> <br>According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who said: “Happy is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked,” this is the generation of Enosh; “has not stood in the path of sinners,” this is the generation of the Flood; “and has not sat in the company of scoffers,” this is the generation of the Dispersion; “but whose desire is in the Torah of the Lord” (Psalms 1:2) – these are the seven mitzvot that he [Noah] was commanded; “and he meditates on His Torah day and night” (Psalms 1:2) – as he derived one matter from another. He said: ‘What is the reason that the Holy One blessed be He set the number of the pure animals more than the impure animals? Is it not because He wants me to sacrifice an offering from them?’ Immediately, “he took from every pure animal…[and offered up offerings]” (Genesis 8:20). <br>“He will be like a tree planted by streams of water” (Psalms 1:3), as the Holy One blessed be He implanted him in the ark; “which gives its fruit in season” (Psalms 1:3), this is Shem; “whose leaf does not wither” (Psalms 1:3), this is Ḥam; “and whatever he does he will prosper” (Psalms 1:3), this is Yefet.
“Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ḥam, and Yefet” (Genesis 6:10).It is written: “Planted in the House of the Lord, they blossom in the courts of our God” (Psalms 92:14). “Planted in the House of the Lord,” this is Noah, whom the Holy One blessed be He implanted in the ark; “they blossom in the courts of our God,” – “Noah begot…Shem, Ḥam, and Yefet.” “They will continue to yield fruit even in old age; they will remain full and fresh” (Psalms 92:15). “They will continue to yield fruit [even in old age],” this is Noah;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Who begot children at age five hundred.</i> “they will remain full and fresh” – “Noah begot.” <br>Rabbi Yudan said: What is the reason that all the generations begot children at one hundred years or at two hundred years, but this one [Noah] begot at five hundred years? However, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If they will be wicked, I do not want them to be eradicated by the water;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He did not want to upset Noah.</i> if they will be righteous, I would be imposing upon him [Noah] to make several arks for them. So the Holy One blessed be He suppressed his [Noah’s] fount,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">His ability to procreate.</i> and he begot only at five hundred years. Rabbi Neḥemya said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: [It was so that] even Yefet, who was the eldest, would not yet be one hundred years old – when he became subject to punishment<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In those days, as explained above.</i> – when the Flood came. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: In the future there will be no death except for idolaters. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Neither for Israel, nor for idolaters, as it is stated: “[He will destroy death forever, and] the Lord God will wipe tears from all faces” (Isaiah 25:8). What does Rabbi Ḥanina do with “from all faces”? It is from the faces of Israel. But is it not written: “As the youth will die when he is one hundred years old”? (Isaiah 65:20). This supports Rabbi Ḥanina. What does Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi do with it? [It means that at that age] he will be fit for punishment.  <br>But is it not written: “Like sheep, they are destined for the grave; death will shepherd them. The upright will rule over them”? (Psalms 49:15). This supports Rabbi Ḥanina. What does Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi do with it? Because in this world, there was Pharaoh at his time, Sisera at his time, Sennacherib at his time,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">They were all punished.</i> but in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will appoint the angel of death as the permanent sentry.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To administer eternal punishment. They will not rise up from the dead in the future, but those who are alive at that time will not die.</i> That is what is written: “The upright will rule over them in the morning; their form will be consumed in the grave,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, their form will wear out the grave.</i> an abode [<i>zevul</i>] for him” (Psalms 49:15) – this teaches that the grave may wear away, but their bodies will not wear away.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">But will be subject to eternal torment.</i> Why to that extent? [“An abode for him”] – because they extended their hands against the Temple, as it is written: “I have built You an abode [<i>zevul</i>]” (I Kings 8:13).
“Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ḥam, and Yefet” – but was Yefet not the eldest?, Initially, however, you should deal with the one who was righteous, born circumcised, the one whom the Holy One blessed be He associated His name with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">“Blessed be the Lord, God of Shem” (Genesis 9:26).</i> from whom Abraham was destined to descend, who served as High Priest,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 14:18.

What is the source? “The children of the great men [<i>benei haelohim</i>] saw….” What is written [immediately] thereafter? “The Lord said: I will obliterate man” (Genesis 6:7). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of bar Pedaya [regarding Lot and the people of Sodom]: All night long, Lot was begging [the angels] for mercy for the people of Sodom, and they were receptive to him. [But] once they [the people of Sodom] said: “Bring them out to us, that we may know them” (Genesis 19:5), meaning, by sexual relations, they [the angels] said to him: “Whom else do you have [here] [<i>po</i>]” (Genesis 19:12), [meaning, what else can there possibly be in your mouth [<i>peh</i>]] to plea in their favor?’ From here on, it is impossible for you to plea in their favor.
<b>“The Lord said: My spirit will not abide in man for eternity, for he too is flesh and his days will be one hundred and twenty years” (Genesis 6:3).</b> <br>“The Lord said: My spirit will not abide [<i>yadon</i>] in man,” Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei said: I will not place My spirit in them when I give the reward of the righteous in the future, about which it is stated: “I will place My spirit in them” (Ezekiel 36:27). <br>Rabbi Yanai and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, both of them said: In the future, there will be no Gehenna; rather, there will be a day that [through its heat] will burn the wicked. What is the source? “For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, and all the criminals and all the doers of wickedness will be as straw; the day that is coming will burn them” (Malachi 3:19). The Rabbis say: There will be Gehenna, as it is stated: “The utterance of the Lord, for whom there is a fire in Zion and a furnace for Him in Jerusalem” (Isaiah 31:9). Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Ilai said: There will be neither a [hot] day nor Gehenna, but rather there will be a fire that will emerge from the body of the wicked one himself and burn him, as it is stated: “Conceive stubble, give birth to straw, your spirit is a fire that will consume you” (Isaiah 33:11). <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: What is, “My spirit will not abide [<i>yadon</i>]”?

The Rabbis derive it from here: “His days will be one hundred and twenty years” – and Moses lives one hundred and twenty years.
<b>“The giants were on the earth in those days, and also thereafter, when the children of the great ones consorted with the daughters of man, and they bore them children; they are the mighty who were from ancient times, the men of renown” (Genesis 6:4).</b> <br>“The giants were on the earth in those days.” They were called by seven names: <i>Eimim</i>, <i>Refa’im</i>, <i>Giborim</i>, <i>Zamzumim</i>, <i>Anakim</i>, <i>Avim</i>, <i>Nefilim</i>. <i>Eimim </i>– as anyone who saw them, fear of them [<i>eimatan</i>] would descend upon them. <i>Refa’im </i>– as anyone who saw them, his heart would become soft [<i>rafeh</i>] like wax. <i>Giborim<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, mighty men.</i></i> – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said, in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The marrow of the femur of one of them measured eighteen cubits. <i>Zamzumim </i>– Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Intimidating military commanders.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zamzumim </i>is because they would be constantly ready [<i>mezumanim</i>] for battle.</i> <i>Anakim</i> – the Rabbis and Rabbi Aḥa, the Rabbis say: They would wear numerous necklaces upon necklaces [<i>anakim</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This is an indication of their wealth – <i>anak</i> is one of the words for necklace.</i> Rabbi Aḥa said: It was as though they wore the sun as a necklace,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">They lifted up their heads arrogantly towards the sun.</i> and said: ‘[Go away and] let the rain fall upon us.’ <i>Avim</i> – as they brought annihilation upon the world and were themselves annihilated from the world, as they caused the world to be annihilated, just as it says: “A ruin, a ruin, a ruin [<i>ava</i>] I will render it” (Ezekiel 21:32). Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon said: Because they were as expert in soil as snakes, as in the Galilee they call snakes <i>avya</i>. <i>Nefilim</i> – as they toppled [<i>hipilu</i>] the world, fell from the world, and filled the world with stillborns [<i>nefalim</i>] with their immorality.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">It was common for immoral women to abort their illegitimate fetuses.</i> <br>“And also thereafter,” Yehuda bar Rav Ami said: The later [generations] did not learn from the earlier ones; the generation of the Flood did not learn from the generation of Enosh, and the generation of the Dispersion did not learn from the generation of the Flood. <br>“And also thereafter, when the children of the great ones consorted with the daughters of man,” Rabbi Berekhya said: A woman would go out to the marketplace and would see a young man and desire him.

However, it is because they brought desolation [<i>hishimu</i>] to the world, they were annihilated [<i>hushamu</i>] from the world, and they caused the world to become desolate [<i>yishom</i>]. Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Men whose names were articulated above. It is as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said; all these names are expressions of rebellion: “Irad” (Genesis 4:18) – ‘I will expel [<i>ored</i>] them from the world’; “Meḥuyael” (Genesis 4:18) – ‘I will eradicate [<i>moḥeh</i>] them from the world’; “Metushael” (Genesis 4:18) – ‘I will uproot [<i>matish</i>] them from the world’; [“Lemekh” (Genesis 4:18)] – ‘What do I have to do with Lemekh<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Lemekh is an acronym for <i>ma li valakh </i>– what need do I have of you?</i> and his offspring?’ <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “They are the mighty who were from ancient times, the men of renown” – who detailed their actions? It was [Job’s friends,] Elifaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Tzofar the Naamatite.

Here “men of renown” is stated, and elsewhere [concerning Koraḥ’s rebellion]: “Distinguished of the convocation, men of renown” (Numbers 16:2) is stated. Just as “men of renown” stated there refers to contention, so, too, “men of renown” stated here refers to contention.

Chapter 27

<b>“The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the day” (Genesis 6:5).</b> <br>“The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great” – it is written: “For there is a man whose work is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with smoothness” (Ecclesiastes 2:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“There is a man” actually refers to God, as the Midrash goes on to elaborate.</i> Rabbi Yudan said: How great is the power of prophets, in that they can liken the creation to its Creator,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is phrased euphemistically, as they actually describe the Creator in human terms.</i> as it is stated, [describing a vision of God]: “I heard the voice of a man by the Ulai” (Daniel 8:16). Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: You have another verse that is even clearer than this one, as it is stated [describing a vision of God]: “And upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness, like the appearance of a man” (Ezekiel 1:26). “Whose work is with wisdom” – as it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom” (Proverbs 3:19). “With knowledge” – as it is stated: “With His knowledge the depths were breached” (Proverbs 3:20). “And with smoothness” – Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: Neither with toil nor with exertion did the Holy One blessed be He create His world, but rather, “With the word of the Lord the heavens were made” (Psalms 33:6) – upon [utterance of] the word of the Lord, the heavens were already made. “But he will give it over to a man who did not toil for it to be his portion” (Ecclesiastes 2:21) – this is the generation of the Flood. “This too is futility and a great evil” (Ecclesiastes 2:21) – “the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great.”
Another matter: “The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth” – it is written: “For all his days are pains, and anger is his concern; even at night his heart does not rest. This too is futility” (Ecclesiastes 2:23). “For all his days are pains” – this is the generation of Enosh and the generation of the Flood, who would pain the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “And anger is his concern” – as they would anger the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “Even at night his heart does not rest” – from transgressions. And from where is it derived that [they sinned] during the day as well? The verse states: “And every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the day.” <br>Another matter: “Even at night his heart does not rest” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, [who did not rest] from bringing punishment upon them during the day and punishment during the night, as it is written: “He obliterated all existence” (Genesis 7:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The proof for this assertion is actually from another verse: “The rain was upon the land forty days and forty nights” (Genesis 7:12) (<i>Matnot Kehunah</i>).</i> <br>Another matter, “for all his days are pains” – these are the people of Sodom, who would pain the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “And anger is his concern” – as they would anger the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “Even at night his heart does not rest” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, [who did not rest] from bringing punishment upon them during the day and punishment during the night, that is what is written: “The Lord rained upon Sodom” (Genesis 19:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment of Sodom took place at the end of night and the beginning of day (<i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 50:12).</i> <br>Another matter, “for all his days are pains” – these are the Egyptians, who would pain the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “And anger is his concern” – as they would anger the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “Even at night his heart does not rest” – when an Israelite would finish his labor [at the end of the day, his Egyptian master] would say to him: Hoe two furrows for me, chop two logs for me. <br>Another matter: “Even at night his heart does not rest” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, [who did not rest] from bringing punishment upon them during the day and punishment during the night; that is what is written: “It was at midnight” (Exodus 12:29). “This too is futility” (Ecclesiastes 2:23).
“The Lord saw that [the wickedness of man] was great [<i>raba</i>]” (Genesis 6:5) – Rabbi Ḥanina said: It was constantly increasing [<i>rava</i>]. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: We are informed that the generation of the Flood was punished with water and that the people of Sodom were punished with fire. From where can we learn to apply what is stated here to there, and what is stated there to here? The verse states: <i>Raba </i>[here and]<i> raba </i>[there]<i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“Because the outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great [<i>raba</i>]” (Genesis 18:20).</i> </i>for a verbal analogy.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Indicating that both the people of the Flood and the people of Sodom were punished by both water and fire.</i> <br>“And every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the day” – from when the sun would rise until it would set there was no hope for them. That is what is written: “The murderer rises in daylight, kills the poor and indigent, and at night is like a thief” (Job 24:14). But is it not written: “In the dark they burrow under houses; during the day they remain sealed at home”?

<b>“The Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was saddened in His heart” (Genesis 6:6).</b> <br>“The Lord regretted [<i>vayinaḥem</i>] that He had made man on the earth” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: [God said:] ‘There was regret before Me that I created him below [“on the earth”], for had I created him on High, he would never have rebelled against Me.’ Rabbi Neḥemya said: [God said:] ‘I take solace [<i>mitnaḥem</i>] in the fact that I created him below [“on the earth”], for had I created him on High, just as he incited the lower beings [on earth] to rebel against Me, so he would have incited the supernal beings [the angels] to rebel against Me.’  <br>Rabbi Aivu said: [God said:] ‘There was regret before Me that I created an evil inclination in him, as had I not created an evil inclination in him, he would not have rebelled against Me.’ Rabbi Levi said: [God said:] ‘I take solace in the fact that I made him so that he would [ultimately] be placed in the earth.’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He is mortal and will ultimately die, so there is a time limit to his wickedness.</i> <br>“And He was saddened in His heart” – Rabbi Berekhya said: This is analogous to a king who built a palace by means of an architect.

So, “He was saddened in his heart.” <br>A certain heretic asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, saying to him: ‘Do you not say that the Holy One blessed be He foresees the future?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ [The heretic continued:] ‘But is it not written: “He was saddened in his heart”?’ He said to him: ‘Has a male offspring ever been born to you in your lifetime?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘What did you do?’ He said to him: ‘I rejoiced and encouraged everyone else to rejoice.’ He said to him: ‘But did you not know that he would ultimately die?’ He said to him: ‘At a time of rejoicing there is rejoicing; at a time of mourning there is mourning.’ He said to him: ‘So was the situation before the Holy One blessed be He, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Seven days the Holy One blessed be He mourned His world before the Flood came to the world. What is the source? “He was saddened [<i>vayitatzev</i>] in his heart,” and <i>atziva</i> is nothing other than mourning, just as it says: “The king is grieving [<i>ne’etzav</i>] over his son”’ (II Samuel 19:3).

Chapter 28

<b>“The Lord said: I will obliterate man whom I have created from the face of the earth; from man to animal, to crawling creatures, to bird of the heavens, as I regret that I made them” (Genesis 6:7).</b> <br>“The Lord said: I will obliterate man.” “Therefore, He knows [<i>yakir</i>] their activities, and He turns it into night, and they are crushed” (Job 34:25) – Rabbi Ḥanina asked of Rabbi Yoḥanan, saying to him: What is it that is written: “Therefore, He knows their activities…”? He said to him: The Holy One blessed be He does not exact retribution from the wicked until He first reads out their indictment<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Interpreting <i>yakir</i> as “He makes known,” rather than “He knows.”</i> on High. Only then the Holy One blessed be He exacts retribution from them, as the Holy One blessed be He transforms [their] day into night, preparing them for punishment,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Determining the severity of the sin.</i> and then He exacts retribution from them. So, initially, “the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great” (Genesis 6:5),<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This was His “reading out their indictment.”</i> then, “the Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth” (Genesis 6:6), and then, “The Lord said: I will obliterate man whom I have created.”
Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rav Beivai: “Let the water…be gathered [<i>yikavu</i>]” (Genesis 1:9) – let a set measure be established for the water, just as it is stated: “A plumb line [<i>kav</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kav</i> is a measure used in building.</i> will be extended over Jerusalem” (Zechariah 1:16). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Levi: [It means,] let the water eagerly wait [<i>yekavu</i>] for Me, for what I am going to do with it in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">After confining it at first, when it is time to bring the Flood I will allow it to cover the entire earth once again.</i> This is analogous to a king who built a palace and settled mute residents in it. They would rise early and greet the king with gestures with fingers and with kerchiefs. The king said: If they, who are mute, rise early and greet me with gestures with fingers, if they could speak, all the more so. The king then settled speaking residents in it. They rose up and seized the palace, and said: This palace is not the king’s; it is ours. The king said: Let the palace be restored to its previous state. So, in the beginning, the praises of the Holy One blessed be He would arise only from the water, as it is written: “It is from the sound of many waters…” (Psalms 93:4). What would they say? “The Lord is mighty on High” (Psalms 93:4). The Holy One blessed be He said: If these [waters] that have no ability to talk and speak and yet they laud Me, when man will be created, all the more so. [But] the generation of Enosh rose up and rebelled against Him, the generation of the Flood rebelled against him, the generation of the Dispersion rebelled against Him. The Holy One blessed be He said: Let these [mankind] be expelled and let these [waters] come back. That is what is written: “The Lord said: I will obliterate man whom I have created.” What do they think – that I need lions, or regiments of soldiers? Did I not create the world with [mere] speech? I will eradicate them from the world with speech. Rabbi Berekhya said: Did I not create them only from soil? What washes away soil? It is water.
“The Lord said: I will obliterate man [<i>haadam</i>]” – Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even the lower millstone was obliterated. Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even the dust of Adam the first man was obliterated. When Rabbi Yehuda expounded this in public in Tzippori, they did not accept it from him. Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak said: Even the sacrum, from which the Holy One blessed be He will cause man to sprout in the future,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When the dead will be resurrected.</i> was obliterated. <br>Hadrian, may his bones be crushed, once asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya, saying to him: From where will the Holy One blessed be He cause man to sprout in the future? He said to him: From the sacrum. He said to him: From where do you know this? He said to him: Bring one to me and I will show you. He ground it in a mill, but it did not become ground up. He placed it in water but it did not dissolve. He placed in on an anvil and began striking it with a hammer; the anvil split and the hammer broke and it [the sacrum] lacked nothing.
“I will obliterate [<i>emḥe</i>]” – I impose My will [<i>mamḥe</i>] upon My creations, but My creations do not impose their will [<i>mamḥim</i>] upon Me. <br>Rabbi Elazar said: This is analogous to a king who had storehouses of inferior grain. The residents of the province began slandering the king, saying that he had a bad disposition.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">They said he was stingy, because he never opened the storehouses, which they assumed were full of good produce.</i> What did the king do? He opened for them the best of them, and they filled the entire province with rotten produce. They [the residents] began gathering it up and discarding it into the river. So too, if these, the most notable among them, did so, the iniquitous among them all the more so.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If the generation of the Flood, which was composed of the best of all the possible men that God considered creating, were so corrupted, it was all the more so the case that the generations that were not created would have been corrupted.</i>  <br>“One man out of one thousand [<i>elef</i>] I have found” (Ecclesiastes 7:28) – this is like what we learned: The primary source [<i>alfa</i>] for wine.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is from <i>Menaḥot</i> 86b, and the verse thus means: I have found one superior man, i.e., Noah.</i>  <br>“I will obliterate man whom I have created”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that there were also men whom God did not create, though He had intended to.</i> – it was God’s original thought to create one thousand generations. How many of them were obliterated?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">How many were not actually created?</i> Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: Nine hundred and seventy-four generations.

Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: What was not done [even] by the generation of the Flood was done by the ten tribes.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The ten tribes were even more sinful than the generation of the Flood.</i> Regarding the generation of the Flood it is written: “And that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the day” (Genesis 6:5), while regarding the ten tribes it is written: “Woe, the devisers of iniquity and the evildoers on their beds” (Micah 2:1) – that is at night. From where is it derived during the day as well? The verse states: “They perform it at the morning light” (Micah 2:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The generation of the Flood sinned all day, but the ten tribes sinned both by day and by night.</i> [Yet] from these [the generation of the Flood], no remnant remained, whereas from those [the ten tribes] there was a remnant. However, it is due to the merit of the righteous men and women that were destined to arise from them. That is what is written: “But behold, a remnant has remained in it who are being taken out, sons and daughters” (Ezekiel 14:22). It is not written here, “they are taking out [<i>motziim</i>] sons and daughters,” but rather: “who are being taken out [<i>mutza’im</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mutza’im</i> can also mean: those who will emerge.</i> sons and daughters” – due to the merit of the righteous men and women who were destined to descend from them. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: What was not done by the people of Sodom was done by the tribe of Judah and Benjamin. Regarding the people of Sodom it is written: “And their sin because it is very grave” (Genesis 18:20), but regarding the tribe of Judah it is written: “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great” (Ezekiel 9:9). [Yet] from these [the people of Sodom], no remnant remained, whereas from those [Judah and Benjamin] there was a remnant. However, that one, “[Sodom], which was overthrown in a moment” (Lamentations 4:6) – because they did not extend their hands to do charitable deeds; “and no hands seized [<i>ḥalu</i>] it” (Lamentations 4:6) – Rabbi Tanḥum said: Hand did not reach out [<i>ḥalat</i>] to hand [to assist one another]. But these [Judah and Benjamin] did extend their hands to do charitable deeds: “The hands of merciful women cooked their children” (Lamentations 4:10). Why to that extent? “They were food [<i>levarot</i>] for them in the disaster of the daughter of my people” (Lamentations 4:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is not to be understood literally, but means that these women kept food from their own children in order to provide first meals [<i>havraa</i>] for their mourning friends.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥanin said: What is not stated regarding the generation of the Flood is stated regarding coastal cities: “Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, nation [<i>goy</i>] of the Keretites” (Zephaniah 2:5) – a nation that was worthy of total annihilation [<i>karet</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas the generation of the Flood had Noah, who survived.</i> So by what merit did they in fact endure? It is by the merit of one gentile [<i>goy</i>], by the merit of one God-fearing man, whom they would produce each year. Rabbi Levi interpreted it favorably: A nation that established [<i>karat</i>] a covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The subject of that verse is the Philistines, who had made a covenant with Abraham (Genesis 21:27) and Isaac (Genesis 26:28).</i> just as it says: “And established [<i>vekharot</i>] a covenant with him” (Nehemiah 9:8).
Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Pinḥas:<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">They discussed why the animals were killed in the Flood along with mankind.</i> Rabbi Yudan said: This is analogous to a king who entrusted his son to a teacher who caused him to stray onto an evil path. The king became angry at his son and killed him. The king said: Was it not this man who caused him to stray onto an evil path? My son is lost; should this man endure? That is why: “[And the Lord said, I will obliterate…] from man to animal, to crawling creatures, to bird of the heavens.”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">So too, the animals were the instrument through which mankind was led astray, as people would gorge themselves on fattened animals and fowl. </i> <br>Rabbi Pinḥas said: This is analogous to a king who was marrying off his son and prepared a wedding chamber for him. He whitewashed it, painted it, and decorated it. The king grew angry at his son and killed him. What did he do? He entered the wedding chamber and began shattering the wood strips, breaking the walls, and ripping the curtains. The king said: Did I not prepare this only for my son? My son is lost; should this [structure] endure? That is why God destroyed “from man to animal…to bird of the heavens.” That is what is written: “I will destroy everything from upon the face of the earth – the utterance of the Lord. I will destroy man and animal, I will destroy the bird of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling blocks of the wicked” (Zephaniah 1:2–3) – it was they [the animals] that caused the wicked to stumble. When one would hunt a bird, he would say to it: Go get fat and come back, and it would go and get fat and come back [to be eaten].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Their hedonism, which ultimately led to their forsaking God, was facilitated by the animals, the birds, etc.</i>
Rabbi Elazar said: “Surely, their substance was eradicated” (Job 22:20) – initially, the Holy One blessed be He eliminated their wealth, so they would not say: He needs our wealth. “And their wealth was consumed by fire” (Job 22:20) – [meaning] that they would see chunks of gold melting in the fire. <br>Rabbi Akiva said: Everyone reproached them [the Israelites] over the gold and silver that they took with them from Egypt, as it is stated: “Your silver has become dross” (Isaiah 1:22); “and I lavished upon her silver and the gold they used for the Baal” (Hosea 2:10); “With their silver and gold they crafted for themselves idols, so that it will be eliminated” (Hosea 8:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">As discussed earlier, excessive wealth and decadence lead men astray. </i> Rav Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak: It is not written here, “so that they would be eliminated,” but rather, “so that it will be eliminated”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to their great wealth of gold and silver.</i> – like a person who says: May the name of so-and-so be obliterated because he caused my son to stray onto an evil path.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">May the gold and silver be eliminated because they caused sin.</i>
Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon:<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Returning to the question of why the animals were destroyed by the Flood along with mankind.</i> They all corrupted their actions in the generation of the Flood – the dog would consort with the wolf, and the chicken would consort with the peacock. That is what is written: “As all flesh has corrupted [its path upon the earth]” (Genesis 6:12). It is not written, “all of mankind had corrupted,” but rather, “as all flesh had corrupted.” Rabbi Luleyani bar Tavrin said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The earth itself also strayed; people would sow wheat and it would produce darnel.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Which is unfit for consumption.</i> This darnel that grows [today], its origins are with the generation of the Flood.
Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The sentence of the generation of the Flood lasted over the course of twelve months<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Eduyot</i> 2:10.</i> – they received their [full] punishment, and they will have a share in the World to Come.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentators emend the text to reflect the Mishna’s unambiguous assertion (Sanhedrin 107b) that the generation of the Flood will not have a share in the World to Come.</i> It is as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Each and every drop that the Holy One blessed be He rained down upon them, He would boil it in Gehenna and take it out and rain it down upon them. That is what is written: “When scorched, they disappear [<i>nitzmatu</i>]” (Job 6:17). Their scorching was absolute [<i>laḥlutanit</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">In Leviticus 25:23, Onkelos translates the word <i>litzmitut</i>,<i> </i>in perpetuity, as <i>laḥalutin</i>.</i> <br>“Even their love” (Ecclesiastes 9:6)<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is seen as alluding to the generation of the Flood.</i> – as they loved their idol worship; “even their hatred” (Ecclesiastes (9:6) – as they hated the Holy One blessed be He; “even their fury” (Ecclesiastes (9:6) – as they would infuriate the Holy One blessed be He with their idol worship; “they have already perished” (Ecclesiastes (9:6) – and they have no share in the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This apparently refers to the World to Come. </i> referring to “anything that takes place under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 9:6). <br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: “As I regret that I made them, but Noah found favor [in God’s eyes]” (Genesis 6:7–8) – this is bewildering.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Interpreting <i>venoaḥ</i> as “and Noah,” rather than “but Noah.” Why is Noah included among the wicked?.</i> However, even Noah, who [alone] remained from them, it is not that he was worthy, but rather that he found favor [in God’s eyes].

Chapter 29

<b>“But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord” (Genesis 6:8).</b>  <br>“But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.” It is written: “He will rescue the unclean [<i>i-naki</i>], and he will escape by the pureness of Your hands” (Job 22:30). Rabbi Ḥanina of Anatot said: Noah had [only] one ounce [<i>onkia</i>] of virtue to his credit.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of the beginning of the Job verse, then, is: “He will rescue the one with only a minuscule amount of merit.”</i> If so, why was he spared? It was “by the pureness of Your hands.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Noah was saved only by God’s grace (the “pureness of His hands”), not by his own merit.</i> This is in accordance with what Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: “For I regret that I made them, and Noah…”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Interpreting <i>ve-Noaḥ</i> as “and Noah,” rather than “but Noah.” God regretted creating even Noah.</i> (Genesis 6:7–8) – even Noah, who [alone] remained from them, it is not that he was worthy, but rather that he found favor in the eyes of the Lord, as it is stated: “But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.”
Rabbi Simon began: “So said the Lord: As when wine is found in a cluster<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When a single wine-producing grape is found in an inferior cluster.</i> and one says: Do not destroy it, as a blessing is in it” (Isaiah 65:8). There was an incident involving a certain pious man, who went out to his vineyard on Shabbat and saw a lone grape and recited a blessing over it. He said: This lone grape is worthy to recite a blessing over it! So too, “So said the Lord: As when wine is found in a cluster…”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">So too, Noah was like a single fine grape on a vine full of inferior ones.</i>
Rabbi Simon said: The Holy One blessed be He found three [precious] finds: Abraham, as it is written: “You found his heart faithful before You” (Nehemiah 9:8); David, as it is written: “I found David, My servant” (Psalms 89:21); Israel, as it is written: “Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel” (Hosea 9:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In each case, God rejoiced, as when one finds a treasure.</i> The students raised an objection to Rabbi Simon: But is it not written [also]: “But Noah found favor”?

Rabbi Huna, Rabbi Pinḥas, Rabbi Ḥanin, and Rabbi Hoshaya do not disagree.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">With the previous explanations.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, and the Rabbis do disagree. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is analogous to one who was walking on the road and he met someone and attached himself to him. To what extent? To the extent that he entered into a friendly relationship with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">So too, God befriended Noah, as it were.</i> So, “favor” is stated here, and it is stated elsewhere: “Joseph found favor in his eyes” (Genesis 39:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph found favor in the eyes of Potiphar, in the sense that Potiphar befriended him.</i> <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: This is analogous to one who was walking on the road and he met someone and attached himself to him.

To what extent? To the extent that he gave him his daughter [in marriage]. So, “favor” is stated here, and it is stated elsewhere: “I will pour a spirit of grace and supplication upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem” (Zechariah 12:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is referring to a spirit of divine wisdom, which is often personified as one’s “daughter” (Maharzu).

Rabbi Simon said: We find that the Holy One blessed be He performs kindness for the descendants due to the merit of their progenitor.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This is a common theme throughout the Bible.</i> From where is it derived that the Holy One blessed be He performs [kindness] with the progenitor due to the merit of his descendants? “But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord” – by what merit?

Chapter 30

<b>“These are the offspring of Noah; Noah was a righteous man, faultless in his generations; Noah walked with God” (Genesis 6:9).</b> <br>“These are the offspring of Noah; Noah was a righteous man, faultless,” that is what is written: “When a storm passes through, the wicked are no more, but a righteous man is the foundation of the world” (Proverbs 10:25). “When a storm passes through, the wicked are no more” – this is the generation of the Flood; “but the righteous man is the foundation of the world” – this is Noah. “The wicked are overturned and they are no more, but the house of the righteous will stand” (Proverbs 12:7). “The wicked are overturned and they are no more” – this is the generation of the Flood; “but the house of the righteous will stand” – this is Noah. That is what is written: “These are the offspring of Noah.” <br>Another matter: “These are the offspring of Noah.” It is written: “The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish” (Proverbs 14:11). “The house of the wicked will be destroyed” – this is the generation of the Flood; “but the tent of the upright will flourish” – this is Noah.
Another matter: “These are the offspring of Noah.” It is written: “He will be light upon the surface of the water; their portion in the land is cursed; no one turns aside from the vineyards” (Job 24:18). “He will be light upon the surface of the water” – [this refers to Noah, who was saved from] the decree that was decreed upon them that they be eliminated by water; “their portion in the land is cursed” – that is to say, [the curse of] ‘He who exacted retribution from the generation of the Flood.’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When someone reneges on a purchase after money was paid for the object, he is cursed by the court: “He who exacted retribution from the generation of the Flood, He will exact retribution from one does not stand by his word” (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 44a).</i> And why [are they cursed] to that extent? “No one turns aside from the vineyards” – meaning that their intent in life was solely [monetary,] to plant vineyards. But Noah, his intent in life was only to be fruitful and multiply in the world and produce children, as it is stated: “These are the offspring of Noah.”
“These are.” Rabbi Abahu said: Everywhere that “these are” is stated, it implies: to the exclusion of what preceded it. Here, where “these are” is stated, it implies: to the exclusion of what preceded it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding verses, which described the people of that generation and their degenerate ways.</i> – the generation of the Flood.
“These are the offspring of Noah; Noah” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Anyone whose name is written twice in succession has a [double] share – in this world and in the World to Come. They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “Teraḥ Teraḥ”? (Genesis 11:27). If so, he has a share in this world and in the World to Come! He said to them: This, too, is not a contradiction, as Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: [When God told Abraham,] “You shall go to your fathers in peace” (Genesis 15:15), he was giving him the good tidings that his father had a share in the World to Come. [And when He told him,] “You will be buried at a good old age” (Genesis 15:15) – he was giving him the good tidings that Ishmael would repent [in his lifetime].
“These are the offspring of Noah; Noah” – this is bewildering. Should it not have said: “These are the offspring of Noah: Shem”? It is, rather, [alluding to the idea that Noah brought] a relief [<i>neyaḥa</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">“Noah, Noah” is interpreted as “neyaḥa, neyaḥa” – double relief.</i> for himself, a relief for the whole world; a relief for the ancestors,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">For until his time the remains of the dead ancestors would constantly be disturbed in their graves (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 25:2).</i> a relief for their descendants; a relief for the heavenly, a relief for the earthly;<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For he saved the entire universe from destruction.</i> a relief [for himself] in this world, a relief in the World to Come.
“These are the offspring of Noah” – that is what is written: “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life” (Proverbs 11:30). What are the fruits of the righteous? They are mitzvot and good deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">And this is why it states, “These are the offspring of Noah; Noah was a righteous man.”</i> “And he who gathers souls is wise” (Proverbs 11:30) – as, [in his wisdom,] he fed and sustained<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The animals that he had gathered.</i> all twelve months in the ark. [Yet] after all this praise, “behold, retribution is made to the righteous on the earth” (Proverbs 11:31) – when he came to exit [the ark], retribution was exacted from him. This is an astonishing statement! It is as Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: As Noah was emerging from the ark, a lion bit him and maimed him. He was thus rendered unfit to sacrifice, and his son Shem sacrificed in his stead. [The verse continues with] an <i>a fortiori</i> conclusion: “all the more so, the wicked and the sinner” (Proverbs 11:31) – this is the generation of the Flood.
“[Noah was a righteous] man [<i>ish</i>]” – everywhere that <i>ish</i> is stated, it is a righteous man who rebukes. As all one hundred and twenty years,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Before the Flood, when God first decreed that He was going to destroy the world (see Genesis 6:3).</i> Noah would plant cedars and chop them down [for timber]. They said to him: ‘Why are you doing this?’ He said to them: ‘So said the Master of the world, that He is bringing a flood upon the world.’ They said to him: ‘If He brings a flood, it will come only upon the house of that man!’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Noah.</i> When Methuselah died<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">At the conclusion of the 120 years.</i> they said to him: ‘Indeed, it [tragedy] came only upon the house of that man.’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Methuselah was Noah’s grandfather, therefore his death was a tragedy for Noah.</i> That is what is written: “A flame [<i>lapid</i>] of contempt for those of complacent thoughts [<i>ashtut</i>], destined to cause slippings of the foot” (Job 12:5). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: [God declared:] I had a single herald who arose for me in the generation of the Flood – this is Noah;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Noah was a herald in that he announced to his generation the impending Flood, as above.</i> there,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In some unspecified location.</i> when they [mean to] say: ‘He has an announcement,’ [they say] he has a <i>lapid</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">And this is the basis of Rabbi Abba’s interpretation of <i>lapid</i> as “herald.”</i> Of contempt – as they would disparage him, calling him ‘contemptible old man.’ “For those of complacent thoughts [<i>ashtut</i>]” – as they were as hard<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In their obstinacy.</i> as blocks of metal [<i>ashatot</i>]. “Destined to cause slippings of the foot” – as they were destined for two disasters<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Hence the plural, “slippings.”</i> – a disaster from above and a disaster from below.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">“And the windows of the heavens were opened and all the wellsprings of the great depth were breached” (Genesis 7:11).</i>
“Faultless [<i>tamim</i>] in his generations” – bar Ḥatya said: Everyone in whose regard <i>tamim </i>is stated, he completed his years to a multiple of seven.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tamim</i> also means “complete,” and numbers that are multiples of seven are considered “complete.” Noah lived for three hundred and fifty years after the Flood. Abraham (also called <i>tamim</i>, in Genesis 17:1) lived for seventy-seven years after that reference.</i>  <br>“Was [<i>haya</i>]” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone in whose regard <i>haya </i>is stated, he was righteous from beginning to end. They raised an objection against him: But is it not written: “Abraham was (<i>haya</i>) one, and he inherited the land” (Ezekiel 33:24); was he the same from beginning to end?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Was he not an idolater in his youth?</i> He said to them: This, too, is not a contradiction, as Rabbi Levi said in the name of Reish Lakish: At the age of three years, Abraham recognized his Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">So he was indeed righteous from beginning (early childhood) to end.</i>  <br>Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yoḥanan, both of them say: At the age of forty-eight years, Abraham recognized his Creator. How, then, do I explain “<i>haya</i>”? It means that he was destined to guide the entire world to repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yoḥanan disagrees with the interpretation of <i>haya</i> given above, and explains that it indicates that a person had a particular destiny from birth.</i> [Similarly,] “Behold, man [Adam] has become [<i>haya</i>]” (Genesis 3:22) – he was destined for death. “The serpent was [<i>haya</i>]” (Genesis 3:1) – he was destined for calamity. “Cain was [<i>haya</i>]” (Genesis 4:2) – he was destined for exile. “Job was [<i>haya</i>]” (Job 1:1) – he was destined for suffering. “Noah was [<i>haya</i>]” – he was destined for a miracle. “Moses was [<i>haya</i>]” (Exodus 3:1) – he was destined to be a redeemer. “Mordekhai was [<i>haya</i>]” (Esther 2:5) – he was destined for redemption.  <br>Rabbi Levi and the other Rabbis [discussed this]. Rabbi Levi said: Everyone in whose regard <i>haya </i>is stated saw [the emergence of] a new world. Rabbi Shmuel said: They are five: Noah – yesterday [during the Flood], “stones were worn away by water” (Job 14:19), as Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even the lower millstone was obliterated in the water. Then you read: “The sons of Noah who emerged from the ark”? (Genesis 9:18). This [change] is bewildering! However, it indicates that he saw [the emergence of] a new world. Joseph – “they tortured his legs with chains” (Psalms 105:18), but now, “Joseph was the ruler”! (Genesis 42:6). However, it indicates that he saw a new world. Moses – yesterday, he was fleeing from Pharaoh, and now he was drowning him in the sea! However, it indicates that he saw a new world. Job – yesterday, “He spills my bile onto the ground” (Job 16:13), and now, “the Lord added to Job double of all that he had before”! (Job 42:10). However, it indicates that he saw a new world. Mordekhai – yesterday he was destined for hanging, and now he is hanging his hangers! However, it indicates that he saw a new world. <br>The other Rabbis say: Everyone in whose regard <i>haya </i>is stated, he fed others and sustained them. Noah fed and sustained [the animals] all twelve months, as it is stated: “And you, take for you [from all food that is eaten…and it shall be for you and for them for food]” (Genesis 6:21). Joseph – “Joseph provided for his father and his brothers” (Genesis 47:12). Moses fed and sustained Israel for forty years in the wilderness. Job – “I ate my bread alone, and an orphan did not partake of it?” (Job 31:17). This was meant as a rhetorical question. Mordekhai fed and sustained others. Rabbi Yudan said: One time he went around to all the wet nurses, but did not immediately find a wet nurse for Esther, and he nursed her himself. Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: Milk came into him [his breasts] and he nursed her. When Rabbi Abahu expounded this in public, the audience laughed as he spoke [of a man producing milk]. He said to them: But is it not [stated in] a <i>mishna</i>: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: The milk of a male is not subject to ritual impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Makhshirin</i> 6:7.</i>
“In his generations” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: [Only] in his generations he was considered righteous, but had he been in Moses’ generation or in Samuel’s generation, he would not have been considered righteous. In a marketplace of completely blind people, they call those who are blind in one eye, ‘the one of abundant light.’ This is analogous to one who had a wine cellar. He opened one barrel and found that it was [spoiled and turned to] vinegar. A second was the same; a third, he found it turning sour. They said to him, ‘[Do not drink it;] it is turning sour.’ He said to them, ‘Is there any better than it?’ They said to him, ‘No.’ So too, in his generation he was considered righteous, but had he been in Moses’ generation or in Samuel’s generation, he would not have been considered righteous. <br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: If in his generation he was righteous; had he been in Moses’s generation or in Samuel’s generation all the more so. This is analogous to a bowl of balsam oil that was sealed with a tight-fitting lid. It was situated in a graveyard and its fragrance wafted through the air. Had it been outside the graveyard, how much more so! This is analogous to a virgin who was in a marketplace full of immoral women and she did not get a bad reputation; had she been in a marketplace of upright women, all the more so! So too, had he been in Moses’ generation or in Samuel’s generation all the more so.
“Noah walked with God.” Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: This is analogous to a prince who had two sons, one older and one younger. He said to the younger, ‘Walk with me,’ and he said to the elder, ‘Come and walk before me.’ So too, of Abraham, whose strength was great, [God said,] “Walk before Me and be faultless” (Genesis 17:1). But Noah, whose strength was lesser, “Noah walked with God.” Rabbi Neḥemya said: This is analogous to a friend of the king who was sinking in thick mud. The king looked and saw him. He said to him: ‘Rather than sink in the mud, walk along with me.’ That is what is written: “Noah walked with God.” To what is Abraham comparable? To a friend of the king who saw<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Through the window.</i> the king walking in dark alleys. His friend peered and began illuminating for him through the window. The king peered and saw him. He said to him: ‘Rather than illuminating for me through the window, come and illuminate before me.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Rather than illuminating for Me from Mesopotamia and its environs, come and illuminate before Me in the Land of Israel!’  <br>That is what is written: “He blessed Joseph, and said: The God before whom my fathers, [Abraham and Isaac], walked…” (Genesis 48:15). Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is analogous to a shepherd who is standing and looking at his flock. Reish Lakish said: It is analogous to a prince who is walking with the elders going before him. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, we are in need of His glory. According to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, He is in need of our glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">So that we will publicize His name throughout the world.</i>

Chapter 31

<b>“God said to Noah: The end of all flesh has come before Me, as the earth is filled with injustice because of them and, behold, I am destroying them with the earth” (Genesis 6:13).</b> <br>“God said to Noah: The end of all flesh [has come before Me, as the earth is filled with injustice…]” – “Injustice rises up into a rod of wickedness” (Ezekiel 7:11). Does injustice indeed rise up?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">“Rise up” implies success and triumph. But in fact, evil never triumphs in the end.</i> That is a rhetorical question. God forbid; it does not rise up. But if it does rise up, it will be to act as a rod of wickedness, to bring culpability against the wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Injustice does not “rise up” in the sense of success, but in the sense of serving as a tool of punishment. That is what is meant by “into a rod of wickedness.”</i> “Not among them<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">None will be spared from among them.</i> and not among their multitudes [<i>mehamonam</i>] and not among anything of theirs [<i>mehemehem</i>]” (Ezekiel 7:11) – not from them, nor from their wealth [<i>mamonam</i>], nor from their offspring [<i>timhatehon</i>]. “And there is no mourning [<i>noa</i>] among them” (Ezekiel 7:11) – no person experienced any satisfaction [<i>naḥat</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Noa</i>, ending in <i>heh</i>, is interpreted as if it were written <i>noaḥ</i>, ending in <i>ḥet, </i>meaning relief or satisfaction<i>.</i></i> from them, and neither did the Holy One blessed be He experience any satisfaction [<i>naḥat</i>] from them.  <br>“And there is no <i>noa</i> among them” – this is as Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: “As I regret that I made them. And Noah…” (Genesis 6:7–8)<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is interpreted to mean that God included Noah among those who deserved punishment. The Midrash is expounding <i>noa</i> as if it were a reference to Noah.</i> –even Noah, who remained from among them,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">“<i>Noa</i> among them” means: Noah, who was the only survivor among them. </i> it is not that he was worthy, but rather that he found favor [before God, as it is written:] “But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord” (Genesis 6:8). And because they were steeped in licentiousness, they were obliterated from the world.
“God said to Noah: The end of all flesh has come before Me” – “They would make oil between their rows; they have trodden winepresses and are thirsty” (Job 24:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This passage in Job is often interpreted as referring to the generation of the Flood.</i> “They would make oil between their rows” – they would make small oil presses. “They have trodden winepresses and are thirsty” – even though they trod winepresses, they were thirsty. Why have they “trodden winepresses and are thirsty”?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If they pressed the grape harvest into wine, why would they be thirsty?</i> It is because there was a curse on whatever the wicked produced. And because they were steeped in licentiousness and robbery, they were obliterated from the world.
“God said” – “They hated the admonisher at the gate, and they despised the speaker of uprightness” (Amos 5:10). He [Noah] would say to them: ‘Worthless people, do you forsake the one whose voice “shatters cedars” (Psalms 29:5), and bow down to a shriveled tree?’ And because they were steeped in robbery, they were obliterated from the world, as it is stated: “God said to Noah: The end of all flesh has come…”
Another interpretation, “the end of all flesh” – it is written: “They cause people to cry out from their great oppression; they shout out from the strong arm of the multitudes” (Job 35:9). “They cause people to cry out from their great oppression” – this refers to the oppressed ones; “they shout out from the strong arm of the multitudes” – this refers to the oppressors. These surpassed those and those surpassed these. These surpassed those – in terms of their monetary wickedness; and those surpassed these – in terms of wickedness of speech,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They spoke words of blasphemy because of their plight.</i> until sentence was passed against them.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Oppressor and oppressed alike.</i> And because they were steeped in robbery, they were obliterated from the world.
“The end [<i>ketz</i>] of all flesh has come [<i>ba</i>] before Me” – their time has come, to be cut off [<i>lehikatzetz</i>]; their time has come to become desolate [<i>bata</i>]; their indictment “has come before Me.” Why to such an extent? It is “as the earth is filled with injustice<i> </i>because of them.” What is injustice<i> </i>and what is stealing?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Injustice [<i>ḥamas</i>] refers to monetary wrongdoing, so what is the difference between that and stealing?</i> Rabbi Ḥanina said: Injustice involves less than a <i>peruta<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>peruta</i> is a small coin of trifling value. Anything worth less than a <i>peruta</i> is considered of negligible value, and there is no legal recourse to retrieve it, as the Midrash goes on to explain.</i></i> and robbery involves a <i>peruta</i>.  <br>This is what the members of the generation of the Flood would do: One of them would take out a basket filled with lupin beans [to the marketplace]. One person would come and take less than a <i>peruta </i>worth [of beans] and another one would come and take less than a <i>peruta </i>worth; less than the amount for which one would be able to collect compensation in court. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘You acted improperly; I, too, will act improperly with you.’ That is what is written: “Behold, their remnant has gone away from them, and they die without wisdom (Job 4:21) – without the wisdom of the Torah. “From morning to evening they are broken; forever unnoticed [<i>mibli mesim</i>], forever they will perish” (Job 4:20). <i>Mesim </i>is nothing other than a judge,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>mibli mesim</i> means without a judge. They made sure their crimes could never be brought before a judge.</i> as it says: “These are the monetary ordinances that you shall place [<i>tasim</i>] before them” (Exodus 21:1).
Another interpretation, “as the earth is filled with injustice [<i>ḥamas</i>].” Rabbi Levi said: <i>Ḥamas </i>refers to idolatry; <i>ḥamas</i> refers to sexual immorality; <i>ḥamas </i>refers to bloodshed. <i>Ḥamas </i>refers to idolatry, as it is stated: “As they filled the earth with <i>ḥamas</i>” (Ezekiel 8:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The context there is a condemnation of idolatry.</i> <i>Ḥamas</i> refers to sexual immorality, as it is stated: “The <i>ḥamas </i>done to me and my flesh is upon Babylon” (Jeremiah 51:35). <i>Ḥamas </i>refers to bloodshed, as it is stated: “[Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom a desolate waste] due to the <i>ḥamas </i>against the children of Judah, that they shed innocent blood” (Joel 4:19). <i>Ḥamas</i> [is also to be understood] in its usual sense, [injustice].
“Behold, I am destroying them with the earth” – Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rav Kahana bar Malkiya: Even the three handbreadths [of soil] in which the plow operates were obliterated. This is analogous to a prince who had a tutor. Anytime he would misbehave, his tutor would be punished. Or to a prince who had a nursemaid. Anytime he would misbehave, his nursemaid would be punished. So, the Holy One blessed be He said: “Behold, I am destroying them with the earth” – I will destroy them and destroy the earth with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The earth was made to serve man; therefore it was punished due to the misdeeds of man.</i>

Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: “Let the wise man hear and gain a lesson” (Proverbs 1:5) – this is Moses, as the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Craft for you a serpent” (Numbers 21:8), but did not specify [the material].

<b>“You shall make a bright item for the ark, and to a cubit you shall complete it at the top, and the entrance of the ark you shall place at its side; with lower, second-level, and third stories you shall craft it” (Genesis 6:15).</b> <br>“You shall make a bright item [<i>tzohar</i>] for the ark” – Rabbi Ḥunya, Rabbi Pinḥas, Rabbi Ḥanin, and Rabbi Hoshaya did not disagree about this. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana and Rabbi Levi did disagree. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: It was a window. Rabbi Levi said: It was a [luminous] precious stone. Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Levi: All twelve months that Noah was in the ark, he needed neither the light of the sun during the day nor the light of the moon at night; rather, he had a precious stone that he had suspended.

Chapter 32

<b>“The Lord said to Noah: Come, you and your entire household, into the ark, as I have seen you to be righteous before Me in this generation” (Genesis 7:1).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Noah: Come, you and your entire household, into the ark.” It is written: ]David said:] “Destroy those who speak falsehood; the Lord abhors a man of bloodshed and deceit” (Psalms 5:7) – this is speaking of Do’eg and Aḥitofel. “Those who speak [<i>doverei</i>] falsehood” – they and their speech.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Doverei</i>, “those who speak [falsehood]” is spelled in a manner that it can also be read as <i>divrei</i>, the words of [falsehood]. It is both the speakers and the speech that the Lord abhors.</i> Rabbi Pinḥas said: They and their conduct [<i>midaberoteihen</i>]. “A man of bloodshed and deceit” – this one permitted sexual immorality and bloodshed, and that one permitted sexual immorality and bloodshed, as it is stated in Aḥitofel’s regard: “Go consort with your father’s concubine” (II Samuel 16:21). And as for bloodshed, it is written: “I will come upon him while he is weary and dispirited” (II Samuel 17:2), and it is written: “And I will smite the king alone” (II Samuel 17:2). And that one [Do’eg] permitted sexual immorality and bloodshed – Naḥman son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: He said to Saul: ‘Is David’s marriage valid? Is he not a traitor against the throne,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A capital offense.</i> and hence considered [as if already] dead? So now release his wife and declare him a condemned man, so it is as if he is already dead, his life forfeited, and his wife is permissible [to marry].’ Saul arose, and in accordance with his [Do’eg’s] arguments, gave Mikhal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Layish.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">I Samuel 25:44.</i> As for bloodshed, it is as it is written: “And the king's servants were unwilling to extend their hand against the priests of the Lord” (I Samuel 22:17), but Do’eg did kill them, as it is stated: “Do’eg the Edomite turned, and he smote the priests” (I Samuel 22:18). “The Lord abhors” (Psalms 5:7) – as they will neither come to life nor will they be judged [at the resurrection]. [David continued:] “And I, [in Your great mercy, come to Your House]” (Psalms 5:8) – just as they did, so did I.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I too permitted sexual immorality and bloodshed at one point (II Samuel 11).

It is that You dealt kindly with me<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Because I repented for my sins.</i> and said to me: “The Lord has also expunged your sin…” (II Samuel 12:13). <br>Another interpretation, “Destroy those who speak falsehood” (Psalms 5:7) – this is speaking of the generation of the Flood.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">And the speaker in the Psalm is Noah.</i> They and their false speech. Rabbi Pinḥas said: They and their conduct. “A man of bloodshed” (Psalms 5:7) – as it is stated: “The murderer would rise up in broad daylight, he would kill the poor and indigent, and at night he would be like a thief” (Job 24:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This passage is often interpreted as referring to the generation of the Flood.</i> “And deceit” (Psalms 5:7) – as it is stated: “As the earth was filled with injustice because of them” (Genesis 6:13). “The Lord abhors” – as they neither come to life nor will they be judged [at the resurrection]. [Noah continued:] “And I [in Your great mercy, come to Your House]” (Psalms 5:8) – just as they did, so did I.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">By not protesting against the actions of his generation, Noah considered himself complicit in their sins.</i> What is the difference between me and them?

Another interpretation, “Come, you…” – it is written: “For the Lord is righteous and He loves righteousness. Their faces will behold the upright One” (Psalms 11:7). Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon and Rabbi Menaḥama in the name of Rabbi Eliezer bar Yosei said: There is no person who likes his competitor craftsman, but a Torah scholar loves his competitor craftsman, as illustrated [by the friendship of] Rabbi Ḥiyya towards Rabbi Hoshaya, and Rabbi Hoshaya towards Rabbi Ḥiyya. And the Holy One blessed be He [also] likes His competitor craftsman, as it is stated: “For the Lord is righteous and He loves righteousness” (Psalms 11:7)<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God’s “craft” is righteousness, yet he loves others who act with righteousness.</i> – this refers to Noah, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Noah: Come, you […into the ark, as I have seen you to be righteous before Me…]” (Genesis 7:1).
It is written: “The Lord tests the righteous, but He hates the wicked and the one who loves injustice” (Psalms 11:5) – Rabbi Yonatan said: A potter does not test flimsy jugs, as he would not be able to knock on them even once without breaking them. What does he test? Sturdy jugs, as even if he knocks on them several times, they do not break. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He does not test the wicked, but only the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous,” and it is written: “God tested Abraham” (Genesis 22:1). Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina said: A linen producer, when he knows that his flax is high quality, the more he crushes it, the better it becomes, the more he beats it the more it improves. But when he knows that the flax is low quality, he would not be able to beat it even once without it breaking. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He does not test the wicked, but only the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous.” <br>Rabbi Elazar said: This is analogous to a proprietor [of a farm] who had two cows, one strong and one feeble. Upon which does he place the yoke? Is it not upon the strong one? So, too, the Holy One blessed be He tests the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous.” “The Lord tests the righteous” – this refers to Noah,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Noah was commanded to enter the ark several days before the rain started (see Genesis 7:4). This was to test whether he would follow God’s commands.</i> as it is stated: “The Lord said to Noah…as I have seen you to be righteous before Me in this generation.” <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: We find that one speaks some of a person’s praises in his presence, and all of it [his praises] when not in his presence, as it says in Noah’s regard: “Noah was a righteous man, faultless [in his generation]” (Genesis 6:9) – when not in his presence; and it is written: “As I have seen you to be righteous<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Omitting “faultless.”</i> before Me in this generation” – when in his presence. <br>Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili said: We have found that one speaks some of the praises of the One who spoke and made the world come into being when in His presence,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When speaking to Him directly.</i> as it is stated: “Say to God: How awesome are Your deeds…” (Psalms 66:3).

<b>“From every pure animal, you shall take to you seven pairs, a male and his mate, and of the animals that are not pure, two, a male and his mate” (Genesis 7:2).</b> <br>“From every pure animal…” – Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanin in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: We find that the Holy One blessed be He went out of His way to add two or three words in the Torah so as to avoid uttering an expression of impurity. That is what is written: “From every pure animal, you shall take to you seven pairs, a male and his mate,”; “and of the unclean animals” is not written here, but rather, “and of the animals that are not pure.”  <br>Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Menashe said: Also, when He came to tell them [the people of Israel] the signs of an unclean animal, He began only with the signs of the pure animal:<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah mentions four animals that possess one of the two signs of pureness, but are missing the second. In each case the Torah first states the sign that the animal does possess, and afterwards the sign that is lacking.</i> “The camel, because its hoof is not split” is not written [first] here, but rather, “because it brings up the cud” (Leviticus 11:4). “And the hyrax, because its hoof is not split” is not written [first] here, but rather, “because it brings up the cud” (Leviticus 11:5). “And the pig, because it does not bring up its cud” is not written [first] here, but rather, “because its hoof is split” (Leviticus 11:7). <br><b>“Also from the birds of the heavens, seven each, male and female, to sustain offspring on the face of all the earth” (Genesis 7:3). </b> <br>“Also from the bird of the heavens, seven each” – if you say that this means [just seven birds] from each species, would there not be one [bird] that remains without a mate? It means, rather, seven males and seven females.  <br>It is not that I [God] need them, but rather, it is “to sustain offspring on the face of all the earth.”
<b>“For in seven more days, I will make it rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will obliterate all existence that I made from on the face of the earth” (Genesis 7:4).</b> <br>“For in seven more days, [I will make it rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights]” – Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: They violated the Torah that was given in forty days; therefore, [the Flood lasted] “forty days and forty nights.” Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakai said: They corrupted the human form that comes into being at forty days,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A fetus is considered to possess human form after forty days of gestation.</i> therefore [the Flood lasted] “forty days and forty nights.”  <br>“I will obliterate all existence [<i>hayekum</i>]” – Rabbi Berekhya said: The living beings [<i>kiyum</i>]. Rabbi Avun said : Its sustainers [<i>yekuminei</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Mankind.</i> Rabbi Levi said in the name of Reish Lakish: This refers to Cain,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Who “rose up” [<i>kam</i>] against Abel to kill him (Genesis 4:8).</i> who had been suspended in abeyance until the Flood came and swept him away, as it is stated: “He obliterated all existence [<i>yekum</i>]” (Genesis 7:23). <br>“Noah did; according to everything that God commanded him, so he did” (Genesis 6:22) – this pertains to the gathering of the animals, beasts, and birds.
<b>“And Noah was six hundred years old, and the flood was water upon the earth” (Genesis 7:6).</b> <br>“And Noah was six hundred years old, and the flood was water…” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: The year of the Flood is not included in the tally [of Noah’s years].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Flood began when Noah was six hundred years old, he lived for three hundred and fifty years after the Flood (Genesis 9:28), and the Flood lasted an entire year.

<b>“It was after the passage of seven days, and the water of the Flood was upon the earth” (Genesis 7:10).</b> <br>“It was after the passage of seven days, and the water of the Flood” – this teaches that the Holy One blessed be He gave them a reprieve during the seven days of mourning over the righteous Methuselah,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A calculation of the various chronologies found in the first few chapters of Genesis will show that Methuselah died the very year when the Flood started.</i> so that they might repent [in the interim], but they did not do so. <br>Another matter, “it was after the passage of seven days” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He observed mourning over [the destruction of] His world for seven days before the Flood came upon the world. What is the source? “He was saddened in His heart” (Genesis 6:6), and sadness denotes nothing other than mourning, as it is stated: “The king is saddened over his son” (II Samuel 19:3). <br>Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskit said: They sinned with the orb of the eye,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">They used their eyes to covet other people’s property and ultimately steal it.</i> that is like water; the Holy One blessed be He, too, exacted retribution against them only with water. <br><b>“In the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, during the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the wellsprings of the great depth were breached, and the windows of the heavens were opened” (Genesis 7:11).</b> <br>Rabbi Levi said: They acted corruptly with their conduits;<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">They inseminated other people’s wives, and engaged in other sorts of sexual perversion.</i> the Omnipresent, too, changed the natural order for them.

Chapter 33

<b>“God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the animals that were with him in the ark; God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the water subsided” (Genesis 8:1).</b> <br>“God remembered Noah, and all the beasts…” – and it is written: “Your righteousness is like mighty mountains [<i>keharerei el</i>]; Your judgments are great depths. Lord, You save man and animal” (Psalms 36:7). Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva: Rabbi Yishmael says: The righteous, who accepted the Torah that was given from the mountains of God [<i>meharerei el</i>], You perform righteousness with them [to the greatest extent,] up to the mighty mountains. But the wicked, who did not accept the Torah that was given from the mountains of God, You are exacting with them [to the greatest extent,] down to great depths. Rabbi Akiva says: With both these and those He is exacting down to great depths. He is exacting with the righteous by collecting His due from them for the few bad deeds that they performed in this world, in order to shower them with tranquility and give them a better reward in the World to Come. And He showers the wicked with tranquility and gives them reward for the few good deeds that they performed in this world in order to exact [a fuller] retribution from them in the World to Come. <br>Rabbi Levi said: The verse metaphorically compares [the reward of] the righteous to their abode and [the reward of] the wicked to their abode. The [reward of the] righteous to their abode, as it is stated: “In a good grazing land I will herd them, and on the mountains of the height of Israel will be their pasture” (Ezekiel 34:14). And the [reward of the] wicked to their abode: “So said the Lord God: On the day that he descended to the netherworld I caused mourning [<i>he’evalti</i>]; I covered him in the depths” (Ezekiel 31:15). Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi said: <i>Hovalti </i>is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">With a <i>vav</i> instead of an <i>alef, </i>meaning “I led him [to the netherworld].” (In our text of the Bible it is in fact written with an <i>alef</i>.)</i> One does not craft a cover for a vat out of silver or gold, but rather out of earthenware, which is of the same material [as the vat itself]. So too, the wicked themselves are darkness, Gehenna is darkness, the depths of the earth are darkness. I led [<i>hovalti</i>] the wicked to Gehenna and covered them over with the depths of the earth, darkness covering darkness. <br>Rabbi Yonatan in the name of Rabbi Yoshiya transposes the [words of the] verse: “Your righteousness is upon Your judgments”; “like mighty mountains are upon the great depths.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalms 36:7.</i> Just as the mountains weigh down the water of the deep so it should not rise and inundate the world, so do the righteous suppress [God’s strict judgments and] punishments so they should not emerge and incinerate the world. Just as the mountains are endless, so is the reward of the righteous endless.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is an exposition on the straightforward reading of the verse: “Your righteousness is like mighty mountains.” We have transposed the order of sentences in our translation, in accordance with the commentators.</i> Just as the mountains are sown and produce fruit, so, the actions of the righteous produce fruit. That is what is written: “Say of the righteous man that it shall be well with him, [for they will eat the fruit of their actions]” (Isaiah 3:10). <br>And just as the depths of the earth are unmeasurable, so is the punishment of the wicked unmeasurable. That is what is written: “Woe to the wicked one who does evil” (Isaiah 3:11). Just as the depths of the earth are not sown and do not produce fruit, so, the actions of the wicked do not produce fruit, as, were they to produce fruit, they would destroy the world. <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi once went up to Rome. There he saw pillars covered over with tapestries, so they would not freeze in the cold or split apart in the heat. But when he would walk in the marketplace, he saw a poor man wrapped in a mat, and some say in half a donkey’s saddlecloth. Regarding those pillars, he recited the verse: “Your righteousness is like mighty mountains” (Psalms 36:7) – to the one to whom You give, You give abundantly. Regarding that poor man, he recited the verse: “Your judgments are great depths” (Psalms 36:7) – to the one whom You hit, You hit powerfully.  <br>Alexander of Macedonia once went to the king of Katzia, beyond the Mountains of Darkness. He [Alexander] sent for him [to come see him]. He came out and he was carrying a golden loaf on a platter of gold. He said to him: Do I need your money? He said to him: Did you not have what to eat in your land that you came here? He said to him: I came only because I wish to know how you people administer justice. He sat with him. One day, someone came to him with a claim against another person. He said: This man sold me a ruin and I found a hidden treasure in it. The buyer said: I bought [only] a ruin; I did not buy a hidden treasure, [so it belongs to the seller]. The seller said: I sold the ruin and whatever was in it, [so it belongs to the buyer]. He said to one of them: Do you have a son? He said to him: Yes. He said to the other: Do you have a daughter? He said to him: Yes. He said to them: Go marry them off to each other, and the money will belong to both of them. He [the king] saw that he [Alexander] was sitting there in astonishment. He said to him: What, did I not judge well? He said to him: Yes, [you judged well]. He said to him: Had this case come before you, how would you have ruled? He said to him: I would have killed them both, and the royal treasury would have taken the money from both of them. He said to him: Do you have rainfall [in your land]? He said to him: Yes. He said to him: Do you have sunshine? He said to him: Yes. He said to him: Do you have flocks of sheep and goats? He said to him: Yes. He said to him; May the spirit of that man [you, Alexander] depart from his body. It is not for your sake that rain falls on you, and it is not for your sake that the sun shines for you. It is, rather, for the sake of the animals, as it is written: “Lord, You save man and animal” (Psalms 36:7) – the Lord saves man for the sake of the animals.  <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon interpreted the verse regarding Noah. The Holy One blessed be He said: The righteousness that I performed with Noah in the ark, I performed specifically through the “mighty mountains” (Psalms 36:7) – “The ark rested during the seventh month…[upon the mountains of Ararat]” (Genesis 8:4). “Your judgments are great depths” (Psalms 36:7) – the suffering that I imposed on his generation, I imposed on them specifically through the great depths, as it is stated: “[All the wellsprings of the great depth] were breached” (Genesis 7:11). [“Lord, You save man and animal”] (Psalms 36:7) – when I remembered him, it was not him alone that I remembered, but rather, him and everything that was in the ark with him. That is what is written: “God remembered Noah and all the beasts…”
Another interpretation: That is what is written: “There was a small city, with few men in it, and a great king came against it [and surrounded it]” (Ecclesiastes 9:14). “A small city” – that is the world. “With few men in it” – that is the generation of the Flood. “And a great king came against it and surrounded it” – that is the Holy One blessed be He. “And built great siege works against it” (Ecclesiastes 9:14) – He surrounded it and set ambushes [all around].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He inundated the entire world.</i> “A poor and wise man was found in it” (Ecclesiastes 9:15) – that is Noah. “And he saved the city in his wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 9:15) – “he offered up burnt offerings on the altar” (Genesis 8:20). “But no person remembered that poor man” (Ecclesiastes 9:15) – the Holy One blessed be He said [to those people]: It is you who do not remember him, but I do remember him: “God remembered Noah.”
“The Lord is good to all, and His mercy is upon all His works [<i>maasav</i>]” (Psalms 145:9) – Rabbi Levi said: “The Lord is good to all, [and His mercy is] upon” everything, because they are “His works.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God is beneficent and good to everyone, because they are all His creations.</i> Rabbi Shmuel said: “The Lord is good to all, and His mercy is upon” everyone, because that is His attribute, that He is merciful.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He interprets <i>maasav</i> to mean: This is His attribute.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “The Lord is good to all” and imparts some of His mercy to His creations [<i>maasav</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Mercy is a divine attribute, but God imparts some of this trait to mankind, to practice among themselves.</i> Rabbi Tanḥuma and Rabbi Abba bar Avin in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Tomorrow a year of drought may come and [you will see that] people have compassion for one another, and the Holy One blessed be He [in turn] becomes filled with mercy upon them [and grants rain].  <br>In the days of Rabbi Tanḥuma, the people of Israel needed to declare a fast [due to a drought]. They came to him and said to him: ‘Rabbi, decree a fast.’ He decreed a fast one day, a second day and a third day,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">As prescribed in the Mishna (<i>Taanit</i> 1:5).</i> but rain did not fall. He came in [to the synagogue] and preached to them, saying to them: My children, fill yourselves with mercy for one another, and the Holy One blessed be He will then become filled with mercy for you. While they were distributing charity to their poor, they saw someone who was giving money to his divorcée.

He said to him: She is my divorcée. He said to him: Why were you giving her money? He said to him: Rabbi, I saw that she was in distress, and I became filled with compassion for her.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">So I gave her charity.</i> At that moment, Rabbi Tanḥuma lifted his face heavenward and said: Master of the universe, if this man, who has no obligation to support her [his divorcée], saw her in distress and became filled with compassion for her, then regarding You, of whom it is written: “Gracious and merciful” (Psalms 145:8), and us, who are the descendants of Your beloved ones, the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – all the more so that You should become filled with compassion for us. Thereupon rain fell, and the thirst of the world was quenched. <br>Our Rabbi<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, often referred to as simply “Rabbi.”</i> was once occupied in Torah study in front of the synagogue of the Babylonians in Tzippori. A certain calf passed by him. It was going off to be slaughtered, and began lowing, as if to say: Save me. He said to it: ‘What can I do for you? It was for this purpose that you were created.’ Rabbi suffered from toothaches for thirteen years. Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said: All those thirteen years that Rabbi suffered from toothaches, no woman in the land of Israel miscarried, and women in childbirth suffered no pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda’s suffering served as an atonement for all of them.</i> Sometime later, a small creeping animal passed in front of his daughter, and she was going to kill it. He said to her: ‘My daughter, leave it, as it is written: “His mercy is upon all His works”’ (Psalms 145:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda felt that his suffering was due to his having been callous towards that calf instead of feeling pity for it.</i> <br>Our Rabbi was exceedingly humble, and he would say: Anything a person might ask me to do [to show him deference] I would do, except for what the sons of Beteira did to my ancestor,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Hillel the Elder (see <i>Pesaḥim </i>66a).</i> when they stepped down from their prominent positions and promoted him [in their stead].

At the conclusion of thirty days, Elijah of blessed memory came to our Rabbi in the guise of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great, placed his hand on his tooth and it was cured.

Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: He got his name from the resting of the ark, as it is stated: “The ark rested [<i>vatanaḥ</i>] in the seventh month…” (Genesis 8:4). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua says: “[Planting and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night] shall not cease” (Genesis 8:22) – the implication is that they had ceased [during the Flood].

<b>“God spoke to Noah, saying:” (Genesis 8:15). <br>“Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you” (Genesis 8:16).</b> <br>“God spoke to Noah, saying: Go out of the ark” – “release me from confinement to thank Your name. The righteous, through me, will give glory when You perform kindness with me” (Psalms 142:8). “Release me from confinement [<i>masger</i>]” – this refers to Noah, who had been confined to the ark<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Of which it is said: “The Lord shut it [<i>vayisgor</i>] for him” (Genesis 7:16).</i> for twelve months. “To thank Your name” – to give thanks to Your name. “The righteous, through me, will give glory [<i>yakhtiru</i>]” – the righteous will crown You<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yakhtiru</i> is related to <i>keter</i>, crown.</i> through me.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Noah is mentioned in the Rosh Hashana liturgy: “You also lovingly remembered Noah and granted him salvation and mercy.”</i> “When You perform kindness with me” – You performed kindness with me and said to me: “Go out of the ark.”
“The Lord tests the righteous, but He hates the wicked and the lover of injustice” (Psalms 11:5) – Rabbi Yonatan said: A potter does not test flimsy jugs, as he would not be able to knock on them even once without breaking them. What does he test? Sturdy jugs, as even if he knocks on them several times, they do not break. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He tests only the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous." Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina said: A linen producer, when he knows that his flax is high quality, the more he crushes it the better it becomes; the more he beats it the more it improves. But when he knows that the flax is low quality, he would not be able to beat it even once without it breaking. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He tests only the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous.” <br>Rabbi Eliezer said: This is analogous to a proprietor [of a farm] who had two cows, one strong and one feeble. Upon which one does he place the yoke? Is it not upon the strong one? So, too, the Holy One blessed be He tests only the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous.” “The Lord tests the righteous” – this refers to Noah,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The test was to see if he would leave the ark as soon as the ground conditions allowed it, or if he would wait for God’s permission. He passed this test, and did not leave until God said: “Go out of the ark.”</i> as it is stated: “Go out of the ark.”
Rabbi Yudan began in the name of Rabbi Aivu: “In the transgression of the lips there is an evil snare, but the righteous one emerges from trouble” (Proverbs 12:13) – because of the rebellion that the generation of the Flood<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They rebelled against God with their blasphemous statements – the transgression of the lips (see <i>Tanḥuma</i> Noaḥ 14).</i> rebelled against the Holy One blessed be He, catastrophe befell them. “But the righteous one emerges from trouble” – this refers to Noah, as it is stated: “Go out of the ark.”
Another interpretation, “go out of the ark.” It is written: “If the spirit of the ruler will depart from you, do not abandon your place” (Ecclesiastes 10:4) – this is speaking of Noah.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">“The spirit of the ruler” refers to God’s command to enter the ark to be saved from the Flood. With the end of the Flood, the essence of this command had expired; nevertheless, he followed the verse: “do not abandon your place” until he was told to do so.</i> Noah said: ‘Just as I entered the ark only with permission, so will I leave only with permission.’ [God had commanded:] “Come…into the ark” (Genesis 7:1), [and Noah followed:] “Noah came” (Genesis 7:7). [Now He commanded] “Go out of the ark” (Genesis 8:16), [and only then,] “Noah went out” (Genesis 8:18).
Another matter, “go out of the ark.” – it is written: “Wisdom fortifies the wise more than ten rulers who were in a city” (Ecclesiastes 7:19). “Wisdom fortifies the wise” – this refers to Noah. “More than ten rulers” – more than the ten generations from Adam until Noah; out of all of them, I did not speak to any one of them, but only with you: “God spoke to Noah.”
Another interpretation, it is written: “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose beneath the heavens” (Ecclesiastes 3:1) – there was a time for Noah to enter the ark, as it is stated: “Come, you and your entire household, into the ark” (Genesis 7:1), and there was a time for him to go out of it, as it is stated: “Go out of the ark” (Genesis 8:16). This is analogous to a leader who left his locale and installed another to take his place [while he was gone].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">God ceded to Noah the care of all living beings for the duration of the Flood. Now his time was up, and God came to take back control.</i> When he returned, he said to him: ‘Get out of the place where you are now.’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Now that I am back, you must leave the leader’s seat. </i> This is analogous to a scribe who went to another place and installed another in his stead. When he returned, he said to him: ‘Get out of the place where you are now.’ So it was with Noah. [God told him:] “Go out of the ark,” but he did not accept upon himself [the command] to go out. He said: ‘Shall I go out [and resume normal life,] and procreate, [only to bring my children] into a curse?’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Noah thought that eventually mankind would be destroyed in another flood.</i> [He maintained this attitude] until the Omnipresent swore to him that He will never again bring a flood, as it is stated: “For, this is for Me like the waters of Noah; as I took an oath that the waters of Noah would no longer pass [over the earth]” (Isaiah 54:9).
“You and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives” – Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: When Noah entered the ark, it was prohibited to him to engage in procreation. That is what is written: “You shall come to the ark: You and your sons” (Genesis 6:18) – by yourselves; “and your wife and your sons' wives” (Genesis 6:18) – by themselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Men and women separately.</i> When he emerged, He permitted it for him. That is what is written: “Go out of the ark: You and your wife, [and your sons and your sons’ wives].”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Man and wife together.</i>  <br>Rabbi Aivu said: “They are in want and in famine, they are solitary” (Job 30:3) – if you see want come to the world, and famine come to the world, “they are solitary [<i>galmud</i>]” – consider your wife as though she is <i>galmuda</i> [a menstruating woman].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">There are places where they call a menstruating woman <i>galmuda </i>(see<i> Bereshit Rabba </i>31:12). The verse is teaching: Do not engage in marital relations as long as a catastrophic situation is taking place.</i> Rabbi Huna said: It is written: “Two sons were born to Joseph” (Genesis 41:50). When? “Before the advent of the year of the famine” (Genesis 41:50).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Showing that during times of catastrophe, marital relations should be avoided.</i>

<b>“God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying:” (Genesis 9:8). <br>“And I hereby establish My covenant with you, and with your descendants after you” (Genesis 9:9).</b> <br>“God spoke to Noah, and to his sons…and I hereby establish” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: Because he violated the command,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He did not engage in procreation immediately (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 34:6).</i> that is why he was degraded.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">God did not speak to him alone, but rather, included his sons with him.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: He went beyond the command, and conducted himself with holiness,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">On the contrary, Noah’s abstinence in the immediate aftermath of the Flood was an indication of his holiness.</i> and that is why he and his sons merited [to hear God’s] communication: “God spoke to Noah and to his sons.”

<b>“My rainbow I have set in the cloud, and it shall be as a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth” (Genesis 9:13).</b> <br>“My rainbow [<i>kashti</i>] I have set” – My likeness [<i>kishuti</i>]; something that is likened to Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The rainbow is a representation of God’s likeness (see Ezekiel 1:28).</i> Is that possible?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Is it possible to speak of God as having a visual representation?</i> It is, rather, like the straw [<i>kashin</i>] of the grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The straw is connected to the grain, but is not similar to it.

Some say it was about the passage concerning vows, and some say it was about the passage concerning libations. [Afterwards,] they took their leave of him, but they stayed over for another day. They said: ‘We must go take leave of him a second time.’ One of them expounded and said to the others: ‘It was already written: “Joshua blessed them and sent them off, and they went to their tents” (Joshua 22:6). Why, then, does the verse state [further]: “Also when Joshua sent them off to their tents, he blessed them”? (Joshua 22:7). The explanation is that while Israel was conquering and dividing the land, the tribes of Reuben and Gad were together with them, and spent fourteen years in this manner. They took their leave of Joshua to go back to their tents. But they stayed over there a few more days, and went back to take leave of him a second time. That is why it is stated: “Also when [Joshua] sent them off…”’ Rabbi Yudan said: ‘The tribes of Reuben and Gad were members of Joshua’s entourage, so he accompanied them to the Jordan. When they saw that his entourage had diminished,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Because all the Reubenites and Gadites were about to cross the Jordan.</i> they accompanied him back to his house.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">And there, when they finally parted ways, Joshua blessed them again.</i> The latter blessing was greater than the former. That is what is written: “He said to them, saying: Return to your tents with much wealth, with very much livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with iron, and with very many garments. Divide the spoils of your enemies with your brethren”’ (Joshua 22:8). <br>Another one expounded: It was already written [concerning Solomon]: “On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king” (I Kings 8:66). Why, then, is it stated [further]: “On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away”? (II Chronicles 7:10). The explanation is that they took their leave of him, but then they stayed there several additional days, so they went back to take their leave of him a second time. That is why it is stated: “On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away.” <br>Rabbi Levi said: It is written: “For they engaged in the dedication of the altar for seven days, and then the festival was seven days” (II Chronicles 7:9) – and you cannot have seven days before the festival [Sukkot] that do not include a Shabbat and Yom Kippur. During those seven days the people of Israel were eating, drinking, rejoicing, and kindling lamps. Afterwards they then regretted the matter. They said: ‘Perhaps we have a sin on our hands for having desecrated Shabbat and for not fasting on Yom Kippur.’ In order to reassure them that the Holy One blessed be He approved of their actions, a Divine Voice emerged and said to them: ‘All of you are among the participants in the World to Come.’<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">And this was the second blessing mentioned in the verse.</i> And the latter blessing was greater than the former, as it is stated: “And they went to their tents joyful and good-hearted” (I Kings 8:66). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “Joyful” – that they found their wives ritually pure; “and good-hearted” – that they [their wives] became pregnant with males. Rabbi Levi said: [The joy was because] a Divine Voice emerged and said to them: ‘All of you are among the participants in the World to Come.’ <br>Another one of them expounded: It was already written [regarding Elisha]: “She departed from him” (II Kings 4:5). Why, then, does the verse state [afterwards]: “She came and told the man of God”? (II Kings 4:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">She had already spoken to Elisha and left him. Why did she return to him, and what did she tell him?</i> The explanation is that: “the oil had stopped<i> </i>[<i>vayaamod</i>]”<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayaamod</i> literally means “it stood.” It is usually understood here to mean that it stood still, ceasing to flow.</i> (II Kings 4:6) – [what happened was] that the price of oil had [miraculously] risen<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">And it was in this sense that the oil had “stood.”</i> and she came to ask whether she should sell it or not sell it.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">She wanted to know if the miraculous price rise would continue.</i> The latter blessing was greater than the former. “You and your sons will live on the remainder” (II Kings 4:7) – until the dead will come to life.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">When he said “will live” he meant that it would suffice until the time when all men will return to life.</i> <br>When he [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai] saw that they were men of refinement, he sent a pair of Torah scholars to accompany them, to find out what they would expound on the way. One of them expounded: It was already written: “The angel of God that was going before the camp of Israel traveled and went behind them” (Exodus 14:19). Why, then, does the verse state [further]: “And the pillar of cloud traveled from before them and stood behind them”? (Exodus 14:19). The explanation is that the same attribute of strict justice that had been extended against Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Represented by the pillar of cloud.</i> the Holy One blessed be He redirected it against the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">It is here that the parable of the father with the hot metal tool applies.</i> <br>Another expounded: It is written: “The rainbow shall be in the cloud, and I will see it, to remember the eternal covenant between God and every living creature…” – “between God” – this is the supernal attribute of strict justice; “and every living creature” – this is the attribute of justice below. The supernal attribute of justice is severe; the attribute of justice below is lenient.  <br>One of them expounded: One verse says: “All objects cannot equal it [Torah wisdom]” (Proverbs 8:11), and one verse says: “All of your objects cannot equal it” (Proverbs 3:15). “[All] objects” – these are mitzvot and good deeds. “Your objects” – these are precious stones and pearls. Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum bar Rabbi Ḥiyya: [God said:] ‘My objects and your objects cannot equal it; “Rather, let the one who glories, glory in this: perceiving and knowing Me, for I am the Lord who performs kindness, justice…”’ (Jeremiah 9:23). <br>Artevan sent a priceless jewel to our Rabbi.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the patriarch.</i> He said to him: ‘Send me a valuable object that is as valuable as this.’ He sent him a <i>mezuza</i>.

Chapter 36

<b>“The sons of Noah, who emerged from the ark, were Shem, Ham, and Yefet, and Ham was the father of Canaan” (Genesis 9:18).</b> <br>“The sons of Noah, who emerged from the ark” – “He is silent [<i>yashkit</i>], and who can condemn? He conceals His face; who can see Him [<i>yeshurenu</i>]? To a nation and to a person alike” (Job 34:29). Rabbi Meir expounded: [The generation of the Flood said:] “He is silent” concerning His world;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He allows injustice to proceed without saying anything about it.</i> “He conceals His face” from His world, like a judge before whom a curtain is spread before his face and he does not know what is transpiring outside. So said the generation of the Flood: “Clouds obscure for Him and He does not see” (Job 22:14).  <br>They [the other Sages] said to him: ‘That is enough for you, Meir.’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">You are not interpreting this verse correctly.</i> He said to them: ‘What, then, is the meaning of what is written: “He is silent [<i>yashkit</i>], and who can condemn…”?’ They said: ‘He granted tranquility<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of <i>yashkit</i>. They were granted an exceedingly convenient way of life.</i> to the generation of the Flood, and who came to condemn them?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">There was no one who reprimanded them, so they carried on in their evil ways, until their destruction.</i> What tranquility did He afford them? “Their offspring are well placed [<i>nakhon</i>] before them, with them, and their descendants are before their eyes” (Job 21:8); “They send out their youngsters like a flock....” (Job 21:11). Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis, Rabbi Levi said: One’s wife would be pregnant for [just] three days [before giving birth], as <i>nakhon </i>is stated here, and elsewhere, it is stated: “Be prepared [<i>nekhonim</i>] [for three days]” (Exodus 19:15) – just as <i>nakhon </i>stated there refers to three days, so, too, <i>nakhon </i>that is stated here refers to three days. The Rabbis say: One’s wife would be pregnant for [just] one day and give birth, as <i>nakhon </i>is stated here, and <i>nakhon </i>is stated elsewhere: “Be prepared [<i>nakhon</i>] for the morrow” (Exodus 34:2) – just as <i>nakhon </i>there refers to one day, so, too, here it refers to one day. “And their descendants are before their eyes” – as they would [live to] see their children and their children’s children.  <br>“They send out their youngsters [<i>avileihem</i>] like a flock” – Rabbi Levi said: In Arabia they call a baby <i>avila</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">And this is how we know that <i>avileihem</i> means “youngsters.”</i> “And their children dance” (Job 21:11) – in the manner of demons, as it says: “And demons will dance there” (Isaiah 13:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">They were able to dance with extraordinary robustness and intensity, as demons dance.</i> <br>When one of them would give birth during the day, she would say to her [newborn] son: ;Go out and get me a flint rock to sever your umbilical cord.’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Newborns were able to walk and fully function as soon as they were born, “like flock.”</i> [If she gave birth] at night, she would say to her son: ‘Go out and kindle a lamp for me with which to sever your umbilical cord.’ There was an incident involving a certain woman who gave birth at night. She said to her son: ‘Go and kindle me a lamp so I can sever your umbilical cord.’ He went out and encountered the demon Shemadon. He [the demon] said to him: ‘Go announce to your mother that the rooster has crowed.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Demons can do no harm during the day.</i> Had it not been that the rooster crowed, I would have smitten you and killed you.’ He [the baby] said to him: ‘You go announce to your mother that my mother has not yet severed my umbilical cord,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">And I have not reached my full strength.</i> as had she severed it, I would have smitten you and killed you.’ That is what is written: “Their houses are peaceful without fear” (Job 21:9) – [without fear] of demons; “and the rod of God is not upon them” (Job 21:9) – [they were spared] from suffering. When He concealed his face from them [and finally punished them], who could say to Him: ‘Your conduct is not appropriate [<i>kashura</i>]?’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Who can question or criticize God’s actions? This is the meaning of “He conceals His face; who can see Him [<i>yeshurenu</i>]?”</i> In what way did He conceal his face from them? In that He brought the Flood upon them. That is what is written: “He obliterated all existence…” (Genesis 7:23). “To a nation and to a person alike” – “to a nation” – this refers to the generation of the Flood; and to a person” – this refers to Noah. “Alike” – as the world was founded from him. He was [equally] able to establish His world from a whole nation or from a single person,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is the meaning of “to a nation and to a person alike.”</i> as it is stated: “The sons of Noah, who emerged from the ark.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">And they went on to repopulate the entire world.</i>
“He shatters [<i>yaroa</i>] the powerful without number…” (Job 34:24) – the [powerful] men of the generation of the Flood performed evil [<i>here’u</i>] with their evil deeds. “Without number” – their evil deeds were innumerable. “And sets others in their place” (Job 34:24) – these are the descendants of Noah: “The sons of Noah…were Shem, Ham, and Yefet.” <br>“Indeed, from when there was day, I am He, and there is no savior from My hand” (Isaiah 43:13) – from among the nations of the world. “I will act, and who can reverse it?” (Isaiah 43:13) – all the actions and thoughts that I implemented with the generation of the Flood, who could say to Me: ‘You did not act appropriately?’ But Noah entered in peace and emerged in peace – “The sons of Noah, who emerged…were…” <br>“And Ham was the father of Canaan” – the father of the debased one. <br><b>“These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was dispersed” (Genesis 9:19).</b> <br>“These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was dispersed”  – to what is the matter comparable? It is comparable to a great fish that disperses its eggs and fills the world.
<b>“Noah, man of the soil, began, and he planted a vineyard” (Genesis 9:20).</b> <br>“Noah, man of the soil, began [<i>vayaḥel</i>]” – he became profaned and unholy [<i>ḥulin</i>]. Why? “And he planted a vineyard.” Should he not have planted something else, that was constructive, a fig tree branch or an olive tree branch? Instead, “he planted a vineyard.” <br>From where did he have it [the grapevine shoot]? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: He brought in [to the ark] vine branches and saplings, fig branches, and olive branches. That is what is written: “Gather it for you” (Genesis 6:21) – a person gathers an item only if he needs it. <br>“Man of the soil” – there were three people who were enthusiastic about the soil, but ultimately nothing constructive came from them. They are: Cain, Noah, and Uziyahu. Cain – “Cain was a tiller of the soil” (Genesis 4:2); Noah – “a man of the soil”; Uziyahu – “he had farmers and vine growers in the mountains and on the fertile lands, as he was a lover of the soil” (II Chronicles 26:10). <br>“Man of the soil”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The underlying question is: In what sense was Noah a “man of the soil”?</i> – he remade the surface of the soil;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">He began to re-cultivate the soil after it had been devastated by the Flood.</i> because of him the soil was watered;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It was on his behalf that rain fell upon the parched soil after the Flood (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 33:7).</i> he filled the entire surface of the soil.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">His descendants populated the world.</i> “Man of the soil” – he was a farmer, [called “man of the soil”] after his farming activities.

Rather, it teaches that they placed their hands over their faces as they were walking backward, conducting themselves with respect, in keeping with the [appropriate] reverence for a father upon his son.

Chapter 38

<b>“The entire earth was of one language and of common speech” (Genesis 11:1).</b> <br>“The entire earth was of one language…” – Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Zimra began: “Do not kill them, lest my people forget; scatter them by Your power and take them down” (Psalms 59:12). The Rabbis interpreted the verse regarding Do’eg and Aḥitofel. David said [to God]: ‘Do not kill Do’eg and Aḥitofel, “lest my people forget” – lest the coming generations forget [what they did]. “Scatter them by Your power” – displace them. “And take them down” – take them down from their prominence.’ As for us, what will He do for us? “My Lord is our shield” (Psalms 59:12). “The sin of their mouths, the words of their lips” (Psalms 59:13) – this one permitted sexual immorality and bloodshed, and that one permitted sexual immorality and bloodshed. This one permitted sexual immorality and bloodshed, as it is stated [that Aḥitofel said]: “Go consort with your father’s concubine” (II Samuel 16:21); “I will come upon him, and he will be weary and discouraged” (II Samuel 17:2). That one permitted sexual immorality and bloodshed – Naḥman son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said [that Do’eg said to Saul]: ‘Now, free his wife and declare him a condemned man, so it is as if he is already dead, his life forfeited and his wife permissible [to remarry].’ <br>Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Zimra interpreted it regarding the generation of the Dispersion. Israel said: ‘Do not kill the generation of the Dispersion lest the coming generations forget [what they did]: “Scatter them by Your power and take them down” (Psalms 59:12) – displace them and take them down from above to below.’ As for us, what will He do for us? “My Lord is our shield” (Psalms 59:12). “The sin of their mouths” (Psalms 59:13) – because of the sinful words that they uttered with their mouths, [saying]: ‘Once every one thousand six hundred and fifty-six years, the firmament collapses.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Flood occurred in year 1656 from Creation. These people believed that it was part of some natural cycle, not an act of God.</i> Come, rather, and let us prepare supports; one to the north, one to the south, one to the west, and the one here will support it to the east.’ “The words of their lips [<i>sefateimo</i>]” (Psalms 59:13) – “the entire earth was of one language [<i>safa</i>] and of common speech.”
Rabbi Abba began: “If you crush a fool among the groats in a mortar with a pestle, his folly will not be removed from him” (Proverbs 27:22). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: This is analogous to one who crushes barley grains with a pestle, thinking that he is rendering them high quality. But even after he raises and lowers it, “his folly will not be removed from him.” So it was with the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion. [Two years] after the Flood, “the entire earth was of one language and of common speech.”
Rabbi Yoḥanan began: “One who repays good with evil, evil will not move from his house” (Proverbs 17:13). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: If your friend received you with [serving you] lentils, receive him with [serving him] meat. Why? Because he performed an act of kindness for you first.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The one who initiates kindness first has done something of great importance, and if you want to repay him in kind, you should show even greater kindness towards him.</i> <br>Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said: It is not only one who repays good with evil, but even one who repays evil with evil, that “evil will not move from his house.” Rabbi Alexandri said: “One who repays good with evil,” as the Torah said: “If you see the donkey of your enemy crouching under its burden, shall you refrain from assisting him? You shall surely assist him” (Exodus 23:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From this it is derived that even one who did evil to you, you are obligated to repay him with good and not evil.</i> Regarding him<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding one who fails to do so.</i> it says: “One who repays good with evil, [evil] will not move…” <br>Rabbi Berekhya interpreted the verse regarding these generations, the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion, as it is written after the Flood: “The entire earth was of one language and of common speech.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Having a common language is a great advantage, but these people repaid God’s kindness with evil.</i>
Yehuda bar Rabbi began: “They do not know and they do not understand, for their eyes are sealed from seeing, their hearts from understanding” (Isaiah 44:18). That is what is written: “The giants were on the earth in those days” (Genesis 6:4). Yehuda bar Rabbi said: Should they not have learned from their predecessors? That is a rhetorical question. Should the generation of the Flood [not have learned] from the generation of Enosh;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">They began engaging in idol worship and God inundated them with the ocean water.</i> the generation of the Dispersion from the generation of the Flood, as it is written after the Flood: “The entire earth was ….”
Rabbi Azarya began: “We sought to heal Babylon, but it was not healed; forsake it, and let us go, each to his land, as its judgment reaches the heavens and rises to the sky” (Jeremiah 51:9). “We sought to heal Babylon” – in the generation of Enosh. “But it was not healed – in the generation of the Flood. Forsake it, and let us go, each to his land – “the entire earth was of one language.”
Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Elazar says: “And common speech [<i>udvarim aḥadim</i>]” – obscured speech [<i>diburim aḥudim</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aḥudim </i>means obscured in Aramaic.</i> The [sinful] acts of the generation of the Flood are stated explicitly, while the [sinful] acts of the generation of the Dispersion are not stated explicitly.<i> Udvarim aḥadim</i> – they said harsh words regarding “the Lord is our God, the Lord is one [<i>eḥad</i>]” (Deuteronomy 6:4), and regarding “Abraham was one [<i>eḥad</i>]” (Ezekiel 33:24) – in the land. They said: ‘This Abraham is a barren mule, he does not beget children.’ Regarding the Lord our God, they said: ‘How arrogant of Him to select the upper reaches for Himself and to give us the lower reaches. Instead, let us come and make a tower and craft an idol at its top, place a sword in its hand, and it will appear as though it is waging war against Him.’ Another interpretation,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In some Midrash texts it says here: Rabbi Yoḥanan said.</i><i> udvarim aḥadim</i>, all their items were united [<i>aḥudim</i>] among them – what was in the possession of this one, was in the possession of that one, and what was in the possession of that one, was in the possession of this one.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They shared all their possessions as common property.</i> <br>The Rabbis say: “One language” – this is analogous to one who had a wine cellar. He opened one barrel and found it to be vinegar;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The wine had spoiled.</i> a second, and found it to be vinegar; a third, and found it to be vinegar; [he said:] it is obvious that all of it has gone bad.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The generation was the third wicked generation after the generations of Enosh and of the Flood. The Holy One blessed be He saw this as proof that all future generations would also be wicked.</i> <br>Rabbi Eliezer said: Which is worse [for a king], the one who says to the king: ‘It is either me or you in the palace,’ or the one who says: ‘I am in the palace and you are not?’ Certainly, it is worse when one says to the king: ‘I am in the palace and you are not.’ So, the generation of the Flood said: “What is the Almighty that we should serve Him? What good will it do if we encounter Him?” (Job 21:15). The generation of the Dispersion said: ‘How arrogant of Him to select the upper reaches for Himself and to give us the lower reaches. Instead, let us come and make a tower and craft an idol at its top, place a sword in its hand, and it will appear as though it is waging war against Him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">They are thus analogous to the one who said: “I am in the palace and you are not.”</i> Yet those of the generation of the Flood, no remnant of them remained, while those of the generation of the Dispersion, a remnant of them remained.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment of the generation of the Flood was worse than that of the generation of the Dispersion, although it seems that the sin of the generation of the Dispersion was more egregious.</i> The explanation is that the generation of the Flood, because they were steeped in robbery, as it is stated: “They move boundaries; they rob a flock and herd it” (Job 24:2), that is why no remnant of them remained. But these, [the generation of the Dispersion], they loved each other, as it is stated: “The entire earth was of one language,” that is why a remnant of them remained. <br>Rabbi says: Great is peace, as even if Israel engages in idol worship, but there is peace among them, the Omnipresent says: ‘It is, as it were, that I have no power over them, since there is peace among them,’ as it is stated: “Ephraim is attached to idols, leave him” (Hosea 4:17). But once there was divisiveness between them, what does it say? “Their heart has separated; now they will be punished” (Hosea 10:2). You thus learn: Peace is great, and dispute is despised. “<i>Udvarim aḥadim</i>” – the act of the generation of the Flood was stated explicitly; the act of the generation of the Dispersion was not stated explicitly. Another matter, “<i>udvarim aḥadim</i>” – they said sharp [<i>ḥadim</i>] words, saying: ‘Once every one thousand six hundred and fifty-six years, the firmament collapses. Come and let us prepare supports; one to the north, one to the south, one to the west, and the one here will support it to the east.’ That is what is written: “The entire earth was of one language and of common speech.”
<b>“It was as they traveled from the east, and they found a valley in the land of Shinar and they settled there” (Genesis 11:2).</b> <br>“It was as they traveled from the east [<i>mikedem</i>]” – did they travel from the east to go to the east?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The valley of Shinar is also in the east.</i> Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon said: They transported themselves away from the ancient One [<i>mikadmono</i>] of the world.

This is astonishing. <br><b>“Sarai was barren; she had no child” (Genesis 11:30).</b> <br>“Sarai was barren…[she had no [<i>ein la</i>] child]” – Rabbi Levi said: Every place that <i>ein la </i>is stated, ultimately she did have. “Sarai was barren; she had no [<i>ein la</i>] child” – she eventually had: “The Lord remembered Sarah” (Genesis 21:1). “Penina had children but Hannah had no [<i>ein</i>] children” (I Samuel 1:2) – and she eventually had: “For the Lord remembered Hannah, and she conceived and bore” (I Samuel 2:21). “It is Zion, it has no [<i>ein la</i>] seekers” (Jeremiah 30:17) – and it eventually had: “A redeemer will come to Zion” (Isaiah 59:20); “Sing, barren one, who did not give birth; burst into song and rejoice, [for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, says the Lord]” (Isaiah 54:1).

Chapter 39

<b>“The Lord said to Abram: Go you, from your land, and from your birthplace, and from your father’s house, to the land that I will show you” (Genesis 12:1).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Abram: Go you, from your land…” – Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “Listen, daughter, see, and incline your ear. Forget your people and your father’s house” (Psalms 45:11). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is analogous to one who was passing from place to place, and saw a building with a [candle] burning in it. He said: ‘Is it possible that this building has no one in charge of it?’ The owner of the building looked out at him and said: ‘I am the owner of the building.’ So, because Abraham our patriarch was saying: ‘Is it possible that this world is without someone in charge?’ The Holy One blessed be He looked at him and said to him: ‘I am the owner of the world.’ “The king will desire your beauty, as he is your master” (Psalms 45:12) – to show your beauty in the world. “And bow to him” (Psalms 45:12) – that is, “the Lord said to Abram.”
“The Lord said to Abram” – Rabbi Berekhya began: “By the fragrance of your good oils, your name is like poured oil” (Song of Songs 1:3). Rabbi Berekhya said: To what was Abraham our patriarch comparable? To a flask of balsam oil surrounded with a fastened cover, that was placed in a corner and its fragrance did not diffuse. When it was moved, its fragrance diffused. So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham our patriarch: ‘Move yourself from one place to another place, and your name will be exalted in the world.’
“The Lord said to Abram” – Rabbi Berekhya began: “We have a little sister, and she has no breasts…” (Song of Songs 8:8). “We have a little sister [<i>aḥot</i>]” – this is Abraham, who joined together [<i>iḥa</i>] all the people of the world [in the service of God]. Bar Kappara said: Like one who sews up [<i>meaḥeh</i>] a tear. “Little” – while he was still little, he amassed mitzvot and good deeds. “And she has no breasts” – he was not suckled with mitzvot and good deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He was not brought up by parents who fostered belief in God.</i> “What shall we do for our sister on the day that she will be spoken for?” (Song of Songs 8:8) – on the day that Nimrod decreed upon him to be cast into the fiery furnace.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 38:13.</i> “If she is a wall, we will build upon her” (Song of Songs 8:9) – if he stands firm on his principles, like a wall, “we will build upon her.” “And if she is a door [<i>delet</i>], we will decorate her” (Song of Songs 8:9) – if he is deficient [<i>dal</i>] in mitzvot and good deeds, “we will decorate [<i>natzur</i>] her with cedar panels” – just as a decoration is only temporary, so, too, I will support him only temporarily. He [Abram] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, “I am a wall” (Song of Songs 8:10) – I stand firm on my principles.’ “My breasts are like the towers” (Song of Songs 8:10) – this refers to Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya. “Then I was, in his eyes, as one who finds peace” (Song of Songs 8:10) – as he entered [the furnace] in peace and emerged in peace.
“The Lord said to Abram: Go you, from your land” – “wisdom will fortify the wise more than ten rulers who were in a city” (Ecclesiastes 7:19) – more than the ten generations that were from Noah to Abraham. From among all of them, I spoke only with you: “The Lord said to Abram: Go you, from your land.”
Rabbi Azarya began: “We sought to heal Babylon, but it was not healed; forsake it, and let us go, each to his land” (Jeremiah 51:9). “We sought to heal Babylon” – in the generation of Enosh; “but it was not healed” – in the generation of the Flood; “forsake it” – in the generation of the Dispersion; “and let us go, each to his land” – “the Lord said to Abram: Go you, from your land.”
Rabbi Azarya in the name of Rabbi Aḥa began: “You love righteousness and abhor wickedness. Because of this, God, your God, has anointed you over your counterparts with the oil of joy” (Psalms 45:8). Rabbi Azarya interpreted the verse regarding Abraham. When our forefather Abraham arose to seek mercy for the Sodomites, what is written there? “Far be it from You to do a thing like this, to kill the righteous with the wicked, and [the righteous] will be…” (Genesis 18:25). Rabbi Aḥa said: [Abraham argued:] ‘You took an oath saying that You would not bring a flood upon the world. Are You seeking to evade Your oath? That is astonishing. You [swore that You] will not bring a flood of water, but you may bring a flood of fire? If so, You have not fulfilled Your oath.’ Rabbi Levi said: “Shall the Judge of all the earth not practice justice?” (Genesis 18:25) – [Abraham argued”] ‘If You wish to have a world, there can be no strict justice, and if you wish strict justice, there can be no world. But you seek to hold the rope at both ends; You wish [to have] a world and You wish [to have] strict justice. Choose one of them. And if You do not ease up a bit, the world will be unable to endure.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: “You love righteousness and abhor wickedness.” “Over your counterparts” – what is “over your counterparts”? From Noah until you there were ten generations, and from among all of them, I did not speak with any of them except for you.
“The Lord said to Abram: Go you, from your land” – what is written prior to this matter? “Teraḥ died in Ḥaran” (Genesis 11:32). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: If you follow the calculation [of years] until now, he [Teraḥ] still had an additional sixty-five years coming to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was born when Teraḥ was seventy years old (see Genesis 11:26), and he left him the first time when he seventy years old (<i>Seder Olam Rabba</i> 1), when Teraḥ was a hundred and forty years old. But Teraḥ did not die until the age of two hundred and five (Genesis 11:32), sixty-five years after Abram left him.</i> The explanation is that, initially, you expound that the wicked are considered dead [even] during their lifetimes.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">So Teraḥ did die, in a sense, before Abraham left him.</i> Because our forefather Abraham was fearful, and he said: ‘If I go, the name of Heaven will be desecrated because of me, as people will say: He abandoned his father and left him in his old age.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I exempt you from honoring your father and mother, but I do not exempt anyone else from honoring their father and mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">That is what is meant by “Go you.”</i> Moreover, I will have his death recorded before your departure; first: “Teraḥ died in Ḥaran” and then: “the Lord said to Abram.”
Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: “Go you [<i>lekh lekha</i>]” – twice,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded as though it was written: <i>Lekh lekh </i>– go, go.</i> one from Aram Naharayim and one from Aram Naḥor.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">God told him to leave both places.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya says: “<i>Lekh lekha</i>” – twice, one from Aram Naharayim and Aram Naḥor, and one when He flew him from [the Covenant] between the Pieces and brought him to Ḥaran.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was seventy years old when he first went to Canaan, and it was then that God made the Covenant between the Pieces (Genesis 15) with him (<i>Seder Olam Rabba</i> 1). He then returned to Ḥaran, and left again at age seventy-five, as recounted in our verse.</i>  <br>That is what is written: “Your people [<i>amekha</i>] will volunteer on your day of battle [<i>ḥeilekha</i>]” (Psalms 110:3) – I was with you [<i>imekha</i>] when you volunteered on My behalf to descend into the fiery furnace. “On your day of battle” – when you assembled for Me all the hosts [<i>haḥayalot</i>] and masses.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They converted when you emerged from the furnace unscathed.</i> “In sacred glory [<i>hadrei</i>]” (Psalms 110:3) – from the radiance [<i>hadar</i>] of the world<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">From the east, where the sun rises, Ur of the Chaldeans.</i> I sanctified you; “from the womb of the dawn [<i>mishḥar</i>]” (Psalms 110:3) – from the womb of the world<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This, too, is a reference to the east.</i> I have sought you out [<i>sheḥartikha</i>]. “Yours is the dew of youth” (Psalms 110:3) – because our forefather Abraham was fearful, saying: ‘Perhaps I have a sin on my hands because I was an idol worshipper all those years?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “The dew of your youth” – just as dew evaporates, so, too, your sins will evaporate; just as dew is a sign of blessing for the world, so, too, you are a sign of blessing for the world.  <br>That is what is written: “I said: Would that I had wings like a dove; I would fly away and come to rest” (Psalms 55:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is expounded as referring to Abraham, who had an intense desire to leave his land and go to the Land of Israel.</i> Why like a dove?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As opposed to some other bird.</i> Because all other birds, when they are weary, they rest on a stone or on a tree, but a dove, when it flies and grows weary, it folds one of its wings and flies with the other wing. “I would wander [<i>nedod</i>] far away” (Psalms 55:8) – movement after movement, wandering after wandering.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nedod </i>is expounded as<i> nidnud ¬</i>– one wandering [<i>nod</i>] after another, from Ur of Chaldeans to Ḥaran and from Ḥaran to Canaan.</i> “To repose in the wilderness, Selah” (Psalms 55:8) – it is preferable to repose in the wildernesses of the Land of Israel rather than to repose in the palaces outside the Land. And if you object that Abraham did not act immediately, and did not rejoice over the words of the Omnipresent, and [you ask] why did he not depart [at once]? It is because he had not yet been permitted, but once he was permitted: “Abram went as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot went with him” (Genesis 12:4). <br>Rabbi Levi said: When Abraham was traveling through Aram Naharayim and Aram Naḥor, he saw them eating, drinking, and reveling. He said: ‘Would that my portion not be in this land.’ When he reached the Promontory of Tyre, he saw them engaged in weeding at the time of weeding, hoeing at the time of hoeing,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">They were a hard-working people, not given to merry-making.</i> he said: ‘Would that my portion be in this land.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “To your descendants I will give this land” (Genesis 12:7).
Rabbi Levi said: Twice “go you [<i>lekh lekha</i>]” is written,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Here and in Genesis 22:2.</i> but we do not know which is more dear, whether it is the second or the first. From what is written: “[Go you] to the land of Moriah” (Genesis 22:2), we see that the second is more beloved than the first.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In the second, God told him his destination.</i> <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Go you, from your land” – from your district; “and from your birthplace” – this means your neighborhood; “and from your father’s house” – this means from your father’s household. Why did he not reveal it [his destination] to him? It was to make it more endearing to him, and to give him a reward for each and every stride. That is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan [elsewhere], as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “He said: Take your son, your only one” (Genesis 20:2). He [Abraham] said to Him: ‘This one is the “only one” to his mother and that one is the “only one” to his mother.’<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Both Isaac and Ishmael were the only sons of their respective mothers.</i> He said to him: “Whom you love” (Genesis 22:2). He said to Him: ‘Are their partitions in the innards?’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Is there any limit on a father’s love for all his sons?</i> He said to him: “Isaac” (Genesis 22:2). Why did He not reveal it to him [immediately]? It was to make it more endearing to him, and to give him a reward for each and every statement. <br> As Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The Holy One blessed be He withholds [information at first] and keeps the eyes of the righteous directed toward Him, and only then does he reveal to them the particulars of the matter. So: “to the land that I will show you”; “upon one of the mountains that I will say to you” (Genesis 22:2); “proclaim the proclamation that I speak to you” (Jonah 3:2); “Go out to the valley and I will speak to you there” (Ezekiel 3:22).
Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: This is analogous to a king who was passing from place to place and a gem fell from upon his head. The king stopped walking and stopped his entourage. He made piles of dirt, brought a sieve, and sifted the first pile, but did not find it; the second, but did not find it; the third, and he found it. They said: ‘The king found his gem.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘What purpose was there for Me to trace the lineage of Shem, Arpakhshad, Shelaḥ, Ever, Peleg, Re’u, Serug, Naḥor, Teraḥ? It was only for you [Abraham].’ “You found his heart faithful before You” (Nehemiah 9:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">“Found,” as when one finds a gem.</i> <br>So, too, the Holy One blessed be He said to David: ‘What purpose was there for Me to trace the lineage of Peretz, Ḥetzron, Ram, Aminadav, Naḥshon, Salmon, Boaz, Oved, Yishai? It was only for you: “I found David, My servant; I anointed him with My sacred oil”’ (Psalms 89:21).
<b>“I will make you a great nation, I will bless you [<i>vaavarekhekha</i>], I will render your name great, and you shall be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2).</b> <br>“I will make you a great nation” – he said to Him: ‘Did you not [already] produce seventy nations from Noah?’ He said to him: ‘That nation in whose regard it is written: “For who is a great nation [to whom God is so close]?” (Deuteronomy 4:7), I will produce from you.’ <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: “I will give you” and “I will place you” are not written here, but rather, “I will make you [<i>ve’e’eshkha</i>]” – from when I make you into a new creation,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This could be referring to circumcision, or to the change of Abram’s name to Abraham.</i> you will procreate. <br>Rabbi Levi bar Ḥavyat and Rabbi Abba son of Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Three “greatnesses”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">“I will make you a great nation” counts as two “greatnesses,” as “I will make you” is considered an expression of greatness (see I Samuel 12:6) and the third is “I will render your name great.” </i> and four “blessings” are written here.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Two in 12:2 and two in 12:3.</i> He apprised him that there would be three patriarchs and four matriarchs. <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Because travel causes three results: it minimizes procreation, minimizes resources for expenditures, and minimizes one’s reputation.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">God told Abraham that He would see to it that he would not suffer these three deprivations.</i> It minimizes procreation – “I will make you a great nation,” minimizes resources for expenditures – “I will bless you,” minimizes one’s reputation – “I will render your name great.” As people say: From house to house – a robe; from place to place – a soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">When one moves from one house to another in the same neighborhood, one will always find something, such as a robe, missing.

Mordekhai – “For Mordekhai was great in the king’s palace, and his renown spread in all the provinces” (Esther 9:4) – his image circulated on coins. What was the image on his coin? It was sackcloth and ashes on one side, and a golden crown on the other side. <br>Rabbi Yudan said: [God said to Abraham:] ‘I will institute a blessing for you in the eighteen benedictions,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Amida </i>prayer.</i> but you do not know whether Mine precedes yours, or whether yours takes precedence.’ Rabbi Aḥuya said in the name of Rabbi Ze’eira: Yours precedes Mine, when one recites first: Shield of Abraham, and only then, He revives the dead. <br>Rabbi Abahu said: “Look now heavenward [<i>hashamayim</i>]” is not written here, but rather, “look now <i>hashamaima</i>” (Genesis 15:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">With an added <i>heh</i>.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I created the world with the letter <i>heh</i>.

Rav Huna said: It was not only when Abraham would go to the ill person, but even if the ill person would merely see him, he would gain relief. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Even ships that set sail in the Great Sea were saved due to the merit of Abraham.

The explanation is that He said to him: ‘Until this point I was required to bless My world, from now on, the blessings are passed to you; whomever you deem worthy to bless, bless him.’
<b>I will bless those who bless you, and one who curses you, I will curse, and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3).</b> <br>“I will bless those who bless you” – Rabbi Yirmeya said: The Holy One blessed be He was more exacting regarding the honor of the righteous man than regarding His own honor. Regarding His own honor it is written: “For those who honor Me, I will honor, but those who scorn Me will be dishonored” (I Samuel 2:30) – by others. Regarding the honor of the righteous it is written: “I will bless those who bless you, and one who curses you, I will curse” – I, Myself. <br>It is taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the interpretation of the term <i>venivrekhu</i> (literally translated as “shall be blessed”) as deriving from the word <i>berekh</i>,<i> </i>knee, and meaning to bend the knee.</i> These are the blessings<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Of the eighteen blessings in the <i>Amida</i> prayer.</i> during which a person bows: The blessing of the Patriarchs, at the beginning and the end; the blessing of thanksgiving, at the beginning and the end.

Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: A High Priest bows at the beginning of each blessing, and a king bows at the beginning of each blessing and at the end of each blessing. Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The king, once he bowed [at the beginning], he would not stand upright until he would complete his entire prayer. That is what is written: “It was when Solomon had concluded praying this entire prayer and entreaty to the Lord that he rose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling [<i>mikero’a</i>] on his knees, and his hands were spread heavenward” (I Kings 8:54). <br>What is <i>keria</i> and what is <i>berikha</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">These are two terms for bowing or prostration.</i> Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great demonstrated <i>keria </i>before Rabbi,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> and he became lame [as a result], but he was healed.

Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: [Mordekhai said:] ‘“I gain insight from the elders, for I uphold Your edicts” (Psalms 119:100) – Jacob blessed Pharaoh, as it is stated: “Jacob blessed Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:7).

If you say that it means that they will be wealthy, they [the gentiles] are more wealthy than they [the Jews]. But rather, it is for consultation. When they encounter trouble, they consult with us and we reveal to them [what to do].
<b>“Abram went, as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot went with him; Abram was seventy-five years old upon his departure from Ḥaran” (Genesis 12:4).</b> <br>“Abram went, as the Lord had spoken to him, [and Lot went with him]…” – Lot was subordinate to him. <br>“Abram was seventy-five years old.” That is what is written: “He was rearing Hadasa, she was Esther” (Esther 2:7) – Rav said: She was forty years old. Shmuel said: She was eighty years old. The Rabbis say: She was seventy-five years old.

<b>“Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot, son of his brother, and all their property that they had acquired, and the people that they had made in Ḥaran; they departed to go to the land of Canaan and they came to the land of Canaan” (Genesis 12:5).</b> <br>“And the people that they had made in Ḥaran” – Rabbi Elazar bar Zimra said: If all the inhabitants of the world were to assemble, to create even a single gnat, they would be unable to inject a soul into it, and yet you say: “The people that they had made?” The explanation is that this refers to the proselytes that they converted. If so, [it should have said] “that they converted”; why “that they made”? It is to teach you that anyone who draws an idol worshipper near and converts him, it is as though he has created him. Let it, then, say: “that he made”? Rav Huna said: Abraham converted the men and Sarah converted the women.

<b>“There was famine in the land and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there, as the famine was severe in the land” (Genesis 12:10).</b> <br>“There was famine in the land and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there.” It is written: “Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him, on those who await His kindness” (Psalms 33:18). “Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him” – this refers to Abraham, as it is stated: “For now I know that you are God fearing” (Genesis 22:12). “On those who await His kindness” – as it is stated: “Grant truth to Jacob, kindness to Abraham…” (Micah 7:20). “To deliver them from death” (Psalms 33:19) – from execution by Nimrod.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 38:13.</i> “To sustain them in famine” (Psalms 33:19) – “there was famine in the land.”

“[There was famine in the land] and Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there.” There were ten famines that came to the world: one in the days of Adam the first man, and [so on,] the rest of the discussion [regarding famines], until: And one in the future – “Not a famine for bread, and not a thirst for water, but rather, to hear the words of the Lord” (Amos 8:11), as cited above, [on the verse]: “From the ground, which the Lord has cursed…” (Genesis 5:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba </i>25:3.</i> <br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: In reality, it [David’s famine] should not have occurred in the days of David, but rather, in the days of Saul.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The reason underlying the famine was relevant to Saul, not David (II Samuel 21:1).</i> However, because Saul was [like] the shoot of a sycamore,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Easily broken and unable to withstand pressure, due to his lack of merit.</i> the Holy One blessed be He postponed it and brought it about in the days of David.

<b>“The Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his household with great afflictions over the matter of Sarai, Abram’s wife” (Genesis 12:17).</b> <br>“The Lord afflicted Pharaoh…with great afflictions.” It is written: “The righteous man flourishes like a palm tree; [like a cedar in Lebanon he grows tall]” (Psalms 92:13) – just as the palm and cedar have neither curvatures nor protuberances, so, too, the righteous have neither curvatures nor protuberances.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In their character.</i> Just as the palm tree and cedar, their shade extends far away, so the reward of the righteous extends far away.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Their reward is in the World to Come.</i> Just as the palm tree and the cedar, their heart [trunk] goes straight upward, so too the righteous, their heart is straight toward the Holy One blessed be He.

And their sin is recorded in four places: “An Ammonite or a Moavite shall not enter [into the congregation…] because they did not greet you with bread and with water…[and because they hired…Bilam…to curse you]” (Deuteronomy 23:4–5); and it is written: “My people, remember now what Balak king of Moav counseled, and what [Bilam son of Beor] answered him” (Micah 6:5); “Because they [Ammon and Moav] did not greet the children of Israel with bread and with water, and hired Bilam against them, to curse them” (Nehemiah 13:2); “Balak son of Tzipor, king of Moav…summoned Bilam son of Beor to curse you” (Joshua 24:9). <br>[Consequently,] four prophets arose and sealed their sentence. They are: Isaiah, Jeremiah, Zephaniah, and Ezekiel. Isaiah said: “A prophecy of Moav: For on the night that Ar of Moav was plundered, it was ruined; for on the night that Kir of Moav was plundered, it was ruined” (Isaiah 15:1). Jeremiah said: “Therefore, behold, days are coming, the utterance of the Lord, and I will sound to Raba of the Ammonites an alarm of war, and it will become a mound of desolation, and its environs will be burned in fire, and Israel will dispossess its dispossessors, said the Lord” (Jeremiah 49:2). Ezekiel said: “To the children of the east, against the children of Ammon, I will give it as a heritage, so that the children of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations. I will administer punishments to Moav, and they will know that I am the Lord” (Ezekiel 25:10–11). Zephaniah said: “Therefore, as I live – the utterance of the Lord of hosts, God of Israel – Moav will be like Sodom, and the children of Ammon like Gomorrah” (Zephaniah 2:9).
“Had flocks, cattle, and tents” – Rabbi Toviya bar Yitzḥak said: [Lot had] two tents<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">“Tent” is sometimes used to mean one’s wife.

<b>“There was a quarrel between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock.

Abraham’s herdsmen would say to them: ‘Has theft now been permitted?’ Lot’s herdsmen would say to them: ‘The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: “To your descendants I will give this land” (Genesis 12:7). Abraham is [like] a sterile mule and cannot bear children. One day he will die and Lot his nephew will inherit [from] him. We are not consuming their property, we are consuming our own property.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘This is what I said to him: “To your descendants I will give [this land].” When?

<b>“Lot raised his eyes and saw the entire plain of the Jordan, that it was all watered, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Tzoar” (Genesis 13:10).</b> <br>“Lot raised his eyes and saw the entire plain of the Jordan” – Rabbi Naḥman bar Ḥanin said: Anyone who has a voracious appetite for sexual immorality will ultimately be fed from his own flesh and blood.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">He will end up committing incest. See Genesis 19:32.</i> Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: This entire verse is comprised of expressions of sexual immorality.

He said: ‘I desire neither Abram nor his God.’ <br> “Each parted from his brother.

Yet, despite their relative eminence, the Torah testifies that they “were extremely wicked.”</i> – “and the men of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful to the Lord” (Genesis 13:13). “Wicked” – towards one another; “sinful” – through sexual immorality; “to the Lord” – through idolatry; “extremely” – through bloodshed.
<b>“The Lord said to Abram, after Lot parted from him: Raise now your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward” (Genesis 13:14).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Abram…” – Rabbi Yuda says: There was anger towards our forefather Abraham when he distanced his nephew Lot from him.

The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I said to him: “To your descendants I have given this land” (Genesis 15:18), and he attaches Lot to him, so that he should inherit [from] him? If so, let him go and find two foundlings in the street and bequeath to them what is his, as he wishes for his nephew.’ That is what is written: “Banish the scoffer, and strife will depart” (Proverbs 22:10). “Banish the scoffer” – this refers to Lot; “and strife will depart” – “there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of Abram’s [livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock]….” “And contention and disgrace will cease” (Proverbs 22:10) – “Please, let there not be a quarrel [between me and you]….” “One who loves purity of heart, he who has grace on his lips, his friend is a king” (Proverbs 22:11) – the Holy One blessed be He loves whoever is pure of heart. “He who has grace on his lips, the king is his friend” – this refers to Abraham, who was faultless and pure of heart and became one who loved the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “Descendants of Abraham who loved Me” (Isaiah 41:8). Because he had “grace on his lips,” as it is stated: “Speaking of his feats, and the grace of his speech” (Job 41:4), the Holy One blessed be He became like a friend to him, saying to him: “To your descendants I have given this land” (Genesis 15:18).

<b>“Arise, walk about the land to its length and to its breadth, as to you I will give it” (Genesis 13:17).</b> <br>“Arise, walk about the land” – it is taught: One who walks about a field,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">An ownerless field, or one that is being sold to him by another person.</i> whether along its length or its breadth, acquires the field up to the place that he has walked; this in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Eliezer, as Rabbi Eliezer used to say: Walking about [in a field] is an act of acquisition. The Sages say: One does not acquire it until he walks along it to its breadth and its length. Rabbi Yaakov ben Zavdi said: Rabbi Eliezer’s source is: “Arise, walk about the land [to its length and to its breadth].”

Chapter 42

<b>“It was in the days of Amrafel king of Shinar, Aryokh king of Elasar, Kedorlaomer king of Eilam, and Tidal king of Goyim,” (Genesis 14:1).</b> <br>“It was in the days of Amrafel king of Shinar” – Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi began: “The wicked drew their swords…their swords will come into their own hearts….” (Psalms 37:14–15). There was an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurkenos, that his brothers were plowing in the plain and he was plowing on the mountain. His cow fell and was incapacitated. He said: It was for my benefit that my cow was incapacitated. He ran away and went to study under Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakai.

He found him sitting and delivering a lecture, and the most prominent men of his province were sitting before him: Ben Tzitzit HaKeset, Nakdimon ben Guryon, and ben Kalba Savua. He found him expounding this verse: “The wicked drew their swords…” – this is Amrafel and his cohorts. “To topple the poor and the needy” (Psalms 37:14) – this is Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He was “poor and needy” in the sense that he was defenseless against these invaders.</i> “To slaughter those whose path is upright” (Psalms 37:14) – this is Abraham. “Their swords will come into their own hearts” – “he arrayed against them at night…and smote them” (Genesis 14:15). His [Rabbi Eliezer’s] father said to him: ‘Son, I came up here only to disinherit you from my property. Now, all my property is hereby given to you as a gift.’ He said: ‘It [the extra portion you are giving me] is hereby proscribed from me by vow, and my rights in it [the entire property] shall be equal to that of my brothers.’ <br>Another interpretation, “the wicked drew their swords [and stretched their bows]” – this is Amrafel and his cohorts.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This interpretation appears to be identical to the previous one.

“It was in the days of Amrafel” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Shilat began: “This too is a grave evil; just as one came, so will he go” (Ecclesiastes 5:15).

Another interpretation, “it was in the days of Amrafel” – Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: The following exposition was brought with us in our hands when we came up from the Diaspora:<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When the exiles of Israel returned to the land of Israel with Ezra from Babylon.</i> Wherever it is stated: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days,” it indicates trouble.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayhi</i> is seen as a combination of the words <i>vay</i> and <i>hi</i>, both expressions of woe and misfortune.</i> “It was in the days of Amrafel” – what was the trouble there? “They waged war” (Genesis 14:2). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: There are five such instances.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For the other four instances, see: Isaiah 7:1; Jeremiah 1:3; Ruth 1:1; Esther 1:1.</i> <br>This is analogous to a friend of a king who lived in a certain province, and for his sake the king took an interest in that province. Once some barbarians came to attack him, and they said: ‘Woe unto us, as the king will not show favor to the province as was his wont if they kill his friend.’ That is what is written: “They turned back, and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7) – Rabbi Aḥa said: They came only to fight against the eyeball [<i>ein</i>] of the world;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham is called the eyeball of the world, because it was only for his sake that God took an interest in and looked out for the benefit of the people of the world.</i> they sought to blind the eye [<i>ayin</i>] that overcame the attribute of justice [<i>mishpat</i>] in the world. “Which is [<i>hi</i>] Kadesh” – Rav Aḥa said: <i>Hu </i>is written. It is he [<i>hu</i>] who sanctified [<i>kiddesh</i>] the name of the Holy One blessed be He in the fiery furnace. When the barbarians came to attack him, everyone began crying out: ‘Woe [<i>vay</i>].’ That is what is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Amrafel.” <br>“It was in the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1) – what was the trouble there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Israel was under attack from all sides.</i> This is analogous to a king’s son, whose caretaker resolved to kill him. He said: ‘If I kill him, I will be liable to execution by the king. Instead, I will take away his wet nurse from him, and he will die on his own.’ So, too, Aḥaz said: ‘If there are no kids, there will be no goats, and if there are no goats there will be no flock, and if there is no flock there will be no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, there will be no world.’<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the world will not be able to function in its conventional manner.</i> That is what Aḥaz thought to himself: ‘If there are no children [in school], there will be no students, if there are no students there will be no scholars, if there are no scholars there will be no elders, if there are no elders there will be no prophets, if there are no prophets the Holy One blessed be He will not rest His Divine Presence upon them [Israel].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Consequently, he closed all the schools.</i> That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16). <br>Rabbi Ḥonya bar Rabbi Elazar said: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he locked up [<i>aḥaz</i>] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Isaiah said: ‘“I will hope for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no moment that was as grim as that time, in whose regard it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day” (Deuteronomy 31:18). But at that very time, I [Isaiah] hoped for Him, as it is written [immediately afterwards]: “For it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">When God said that He would hide His face from Israel, He continued, that nevertheless the Torah would never be forgotten by them.</i> Of what use was it to him [Ahaz]?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Despite his best efforts, the Torah continued to be taught, as the Midrash goes on to explain.</i> [Of no use, as Isaiah declared:] “Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord gave me, are to become signs and wonders in Israel”’ (Isaiah 8:18). Were they<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The young men Isaiah was referring to.</i> his children? Were they not actually his students? However, we learn from here that they [his students] were as beloved to him as sons. When he [Aḥaz] locked up the synagogues and study halls, people began crying out: ‘Woe [<i>vay</i>]’ – “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Aḥaz.” <br>“It was in the days of Yehoyakim” (Jeremiah 1:3) – what was the trouble there? [It was as Jeremiah prophesied:] “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder” (Jeremiah 4:23). This is analogous to a king who sent a proclamation throughout the province. What did the residents of one province do to it? They took it, ripped it, and burned it in fire. Thus it is stated: “It happened that as Yehudi would read three or four sections…” (Jeremiah 36:23)<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It was the Book of Lamentations that was being read.</i> – this means three or four verses. When he reached the fifth verse, “Its besiegers have become dominant” (Lamentations 1:5) – “He cut it up with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). When everyone saw this, they began crying out: ‘Woe [<i>vay</i>]’ – “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Yehoyakim.” <br>“It was in the days that the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1)<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A more literal translation would be, “in the days of the judging of the judges.”</i> – what was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). This is analogous to a province that owed a tax to the king. The prince sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do to him? They took him and beat him. They then said: ‘Woe to us when the king becomes aware of these events; what he sought to do to us,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Subdue us.</i> we did to him.’ So, too, in the days of the judging of the judges – when a person of Israel would engage in idol worship, and the judge sought to implement against him the attribute of strict justice,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">And decree for him corporal punishment.</i> he would come and flog the judge. He said: ‘What he sought to do to me, I did to him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">“The judging of the judges” is interpreted to mean that the people committed acts of judgment and punishment against their judges.</i> They said: ‘Woe [<i>vay</i>] to the generation that judges its judges.’ That is what is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). <br>“It was in the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1) – what was the trouble there? [Haman’s decree:] “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate [all the Jews]” (Esther 3:13). This is analogous to a king who had a certain vineyard, and three enemies rose up against it. The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began cutting off the clusters, and the third began uprooting the vines. So too, Pharaoh [said]: “Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22). Nebuchadnezzar [exiled] “the <i>ḥarash</i> and the <i>masger</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">These are two classes of Torah scholars (<i>Gittin</i> 88a).</i> one thousand” (Jeremiah 29:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: One thousand <i>ḥarash</i> and one thousand <i>masger</i>; the Rabbis said: They were one thousand altogether. Haman sought to uproot the entire vineyard, as it is stated: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews…” (Esther 3:13). When everyone saw that it was so, they began crying out: ‘Woe [<i>vay</i>].’ That is what is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Aḥashverosh.” <br>Rabbi Shimon bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere that <i>vayhi</i> is stated it refers either to trouble or to joy; if the context is one of trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if it is one of joy, it is unparalleled joy. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman came and made a distinction: Everywhere that <i>vayhi</i> is stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Even when it is not connected with “in the days of.”</i> it alludes to trouble, and <i>vehaya</i> [alludes to] joy. <br>They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “And there was [<i>vayhi</i>] light”? (Genesis 1:3). He said to them: That was nevertheless not complete joy, as the world was not privileged to use that light. Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: By the light that was created on the first day, a person could see from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One blessed be He foresaw the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion, He hid it away for the righteous in the future. That is what is written: “But the path of the righteous is like a dawning light, growing brighter until the day is established” (Proverbs 4:18). <br>They raised an objection to him: But is it not written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening and it was morning, one day”?

Chapter 44

<b>“After these matters, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying: Fear not, Abram, I am a shield for you; your reward is very great” (Genesis 15:1).</b> <br>“After these matters, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying…” “The Almighty’s way is faultless; the word of the Lord is refined [<i>tzerufa</i>]. He is a shield for all who take refuge in Him” (Psalms 18:31) – if His ways are faultless, all the more so that He Himself is. Rav said: The mitzvot<i> </i>were given only to refine [<i>letzaref</i>] people through them. After all, why should the Holy One blessed be He care whether one slaughters an animal from the throat or he slaughters it from the nape? Thus we learn that the mitzvot were given only to refine the creations with them. <br>Another interpretation, “the Almighty’s way is faultless” – this refers to Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is interpreted to mean: The Almighty’s way is with the faultless, referring to Abraham.</i> as it is stated: “You found his heart faithful before You” (Nehemiah 9:8). “The word of the Lord is refined” – as the Holy One blessed be He refined him in the fiery furnace.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew <i>tzaref</i>, translated earlier as “refined,” literally refers to smelting in a furnace.</i> “He is a shield for all who take refuge in Him” – “fear not, Abram, I am a shield for you.”
Another matter, “after [these] matters…” – it is written: “A wise man fears and turns from evil, but the fool becomes enraged and overconfident” (Proverbs 14:16). “A wise man fears” – “fear not, Abram.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since God told him not to fear, the implication is that he had been afraid.</i> [And God said to him,] “Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and turn away from evil” (Proverbs 3:7). “Do not be wise in your own eyes” – with what you see with your eyes, thinking: ‘Perhaps I will produce offspring, perhaps I will not produce offspring.’ [Rather,] “fear the Lord” – “fear not, Abram.” <br>Rabbi Avin in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina began: “The wicked man performs acts of falsehood…” (Proverbs 11:18). “The wicked performs acts of falsehood” – this is Nimrod, whose actions were based on falsehood. “And he who sows righteousness [has a true reward]” (Proverbs 11:18) – this refers to Abraham, as it is stated [concerning Abraham]: “[For I have known him, because he will command his children…] and they will observe the way of the Lord, to perform righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19). “Has a true reward” (Proverbs 11:18) – “fear not, Abram…[your reward is very great].”
Another interpretation, “fear not Abram” – that is what is written: “But it is you, Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, descendants of Abraham who loved me, whom I have taken from the ends of the earth” (Isaiah 41:8–9) – from Mesopotamia and its environs. “And from its noblemen I called you” (Isaiah 41:9) – from its prominent leaders. “I called you” – I designated you. “I chose you and did not reject you” (Isaiah 41:9). “I chose you” – when you were Abram; “and did not reject you” – when you became Abraham. <br>“Do not fear, as I am with you; do not waver, as I am your God” (Isaiah 41:10) – Rabbi Hoshaya said: When Isaac said to Jacob: “Please approach so I may feel you, my son” (Genesis 27:21), his water spilled onto his knees<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Out of fright.</i> and his heart became soft as wax. The Holy One blessed be He appointed two angels for him, one to his right and one to his left, and they grasped him by his elbow so he would not fall. That is what is written: “Do not waver [<i>tishta</i>], as I am your God” – do not be like wax [<i>tishva</i>]. “I strengthened you, even helped you…behold, [all who provoke you] will be ashamed and humiliated” (Isaiah 41:10–11) – those who are hostile to you. “They will be like nothing, and the people who quarrel with you will perish” (Isaiah 41:11) – those who incite quarrels with you. “You will seek them…but not find them” (Isaiah 41:12) – those who contend with you. “For I am the Lord your God…who says to you: Fear not” (Isaiah 41:13), as it is stated: “Fear not, Abram.”
“I am a shield for you” – Rabbi Levi said two [interpretations], the Rabbis said one. Rabbi Levi said: Because our forefather Abraham was fearful, and saying: ‘Perhaps those people whom I killed, there was among them one righteous man, or one God-fearing man.’<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">And therefore I have incurred God’s wrath and will be held accountable.</i> This is analogous to a person who was passing by the king’s orchard. He saw a bundle of thorns and he went down and took it away. The king peered out and saw him. He began hiding from him. He [the king] said to him: ‘Why are you hiding from me? How many laborers would I have needed to gather it up. Now that you have gathered them up, come and collect your reward.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Those people whom you killed were like cut thorns.’ That is what is written: “Peoples will be like burnings of lime, cut thorns ignited with fire” (Isaiah 33:12). <br>Rabbi Levi said another interpretation: Because our forefather Abraham was fearful, and saying: ‘Perhaps those kings whom I killed, their sons will assemble multitudes and they will come and wage war against me,’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">To avenge their fathers’ death.</i> the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Fear not, Abram, I am a shield for you” – just as a shield, even if all the swords [in the world] were to come up against it, it would withstand them, so you, even if all the idolaters were to gather against you, I will fight against them. <br>The Rabbis said one: Because our forefather Abraham was fearful, and saying: ‘I went down into the fiery furnace and was saved, I went down to do battle with the kings and was saved, perhaps my reward has already been received in this world, and I have nothing [left] for the future.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: “Fear not, Abram, I am a shield [<i>magen</i>] for you” – everything that I have done for you in this world, I did for you without cost,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In Aramaic, <i>magan</i> means gratis.</i> but your reward is allocated for you in the future – “your reward is very great,” just as it says: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20).
Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Huna, both of them in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: Rabbi Yudan said: Wherever <i>aḥarei </i>is stated, it refers to immediate events; <i>aḥar</i> refers to distant events.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew uses both <i>aḥar</i> and <i>aḥarei</i> [“after”] in the common phrase “after these matters.” The Midrash explains that difference between them is that one indicates that what follows took place immediately after the events recorded previously, while the other indicates that it took place after some time.</i> Rav Huna said: Wherever <i>aḥar </i>is stated, it is immediate; <i>aḥarei</i>, distant. <br>“After these matters”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Devarim</i>, translated here as “matters,” can also mean words.</i> – after thoughts of words that took place there. Who had these thoughts? Abraham had the thoughts. He said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You made a covenant with Noah that you would not eliminate his descendants. I arose and amassed mitzvot<i> </i>and good deeds more that he did, and my covenant overrode his covenant.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And thus I was able to slay many of his descendants.</i> Perhaps someone else will arise [one day] and amass mitzvot and good deeds more than I did, and his covenant will override my covenant.’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">And he will be able to harm me.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘From Noah, I did not bring forth righteous protectors [from his descendants], but from You I will produce righteous protectors. Moreover, when your descendants will come to commit transgressions and bad deeds, I will see one righteous man among them, I will consider him to be equal to all of them combined, as he is capable of saying to the attribute of justice: Enough.

“The word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying” – it<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Prophecy.</i> is referred to by ten expressions: a prophecy, a vision,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalms 89:20.</i> preaching,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel 21:2.</i> speaking,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">See II Samuel 23:2.</i> saying,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 4:22.</i> a command,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 2:16.</i> a burden,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">See Malachi 1:1.</i> a parable,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See Isaiah 14:4.</i> a metaphor,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">See Proverbs 1:6.</i> an enigma.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 12:8.</i> Which is the harshest of them all? Rabbi Eliezer said: Vision, as it is stated: “A harsh vision was told to me” (Isaiah 21:2). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Speaking, as it is stated: “The man, lord of the land, spoke harshly with us” (Genesis 42:30). The Rabbis said: Burden, as is its plain sense: “Like an onerous burden, they are too heavy for me” (Psalms 38:5). Abram’s potency [of prophecy] was great, as God spoke to him with both speaking [<i>dibur</i>]<i> </i>and vision, as it is stated: “The word [<i>devar</i>] of the Lord came to Abram in a vision.”
“Fear not, Abram” – whom did he fear? Rabbi Berekhya said: He feared Shem. That is what is written: “The islands saw and feared, the ends of the earth trembled…” (Isaiah 41:5) – just as islands are conspicuous in the sea, so Abraham and Shem were conspicuous in the world. “And feared” – each one feared the other. This one [Abraham] feared the other, saying: Perhaps Shem has resentment in his heart against me because I killed his descendants.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Kedorlaomer was king of Eilam (Genesis 14:1), and Eilam was Shem’s son (Genesis 10:22).</i> And that one [Shem] feared the other, saying: Perhaps Abraham has resentment in his heart against me because I produced wicked offspring. “The ends of the earth” – this one was situated at one end of the earth, and that one was situated at the other end of the earth. “They approached and came” (Isaiah 41:5) – each one approached the other. “Each man would help the other” (Isaiah 41:6) – this one [Shem] helped the other one with blessings, and that one [Abraham] helped the other one with gifts. This one helped the other one with blessings – “He blessed him, and he said: Blessed is Abram to God, the Most High…” (Genesis 14:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">These words were spoken by Malkitzedek, who is identified with Shem.</i>  And that one helped the other one with gifts: “He gave him a tithe from everything” (Genesis 14:20). <br>“The carpenter encouraged [the smith]” (Isaiah 41:7) – this refers to Shem, who built the ark. “The smith” – this refers to Abraham, whom the Holy One blessed be He refined in the fiery furnace. “And one who smooths with a hammer, one who strikes on the anvil [<i>paam</i>]” (Isaiah 41:7) – as he [Abraham] would direct his hammer and strike all the people of the world onto a single path<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Paam</i> can also mean<i> </i>“a step,” and “once.” Abraham’s “hammer” was his ability to persuade others to recognize and follow God, and with this he led them on a path towards closeness with God.</i> to the Omnipresent. “Saying of the glue: It is good” (Isaiah 41:7) – these are the nations of the world, who say: ‘It is preferable to adhere to the God of Abram, and we will not adhere to Nimrod’s idolatry.’ “He strengthened it with nails” (Isaiah 41:7) – Abraham strengthened Shem in mitzvot<i> </i>and good deeds. And, [as a result] “It<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Or “he.”</i> shall not topple” (Isaiah 41:7) – referring to Abraham.
<b>“Abram said: My Lord God, what will You give me, being that I go childless, and the one who has charge of my house is Damascus Eliezer?” (Genesis 15:2).</b> <br>“Abram said: My Lord God, what will You give me…?” – Rabbi Yonatan said: There are three people regarding whom it is stated: Make a request. These are Solomon, Aḥaz, and the messianic king. Solomon, as it is written: “In Givon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night, and God said: Request what I shall give you” (I Kings 3:5). Aḥaz, as it is written: “Request a sign for yourself from the Lord” (Isaiah 7:11). The messianic king, of whom it is written: “Request of Me, and I will render nations your inheritance” (Psalms 2:8). Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Aḥa say in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: We cite an additional two cases from <i>aggada</i>, Abraham and Jacob. Abraham, of whom it is written: “My Lord God, what will You give me?” He would not have said: “What will You give me…?” unless He had first said to him: ‘Make a request.’ Jacob, as it is written: “Everything that You will give me I will tithe to You” (Genesis 28:22). He would not have said this unless He had first said to him: ‘Make a request.’
Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Aivu in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: There were two people who said the same thing, Abraham and David.

The slumber of sleep – “The Lord God cast a slumber upon the man, and he slept” (Genesis 2:21). The slumber of prophecy – “It was as the sun was setting, and a slumber fell upon Abram” (Genesis 15:12). The slumber of a trance – “No one saw, and no one knew, and no one awoke, as they were all asleep because a deep slumber from the Lord had fallen upon them” (I Samuel 26:12). The Rabbis said: There is also the slumber of foolishness, as it is written: “For the Lord poured upon you a spirit of deep slumber…” (Isaiah 29:10). <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: There are three microcosms: sleep is a microcosm of death; a dream is a microcosm of prophecy; Shabbat is a microcosm of the World to Come.

Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: [Sarah said:] ‘I have a grievance against you.’ This is analogous to two men incarcerated in prison.

Lazy – “quickly bring three <i>seah </i>of high quality flour” (Genesis 18:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since Abraham had to urge her to hurry, the implication is that she would not otherwise have acted with alacrity.</i> Jealous, as it is written: “Rachel was jealous of her sister” (Genesis 30:1). <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Neḥemya said: Sensitive and chatty, as well. Sensitive – “Sarai said to Abram: The injustice done to me is on you.” Talkative – “Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses” (Numbers 12:1). <br>Rabbi Levi said: Thieves, as well, as it is stated: “Rachel stole the household idols” (Genesis 31:19).

They are: Isaac, Solomon, and Yoshiyahu. Regarding Isaac it is written: “But Sarah your wife will bear you a son, and you will call his name Isaac” (Genesis 17:19). Regarding Solomon, what does it say? “Behold, a son will be born to you, he will be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies…Solomon will be his name” (I Chronicles 22:9). Regarding Yoshiyahu it is written: “He called against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said: Altar, altar!

<b>“Abram was ninety-nine years old, and the Lord appeared to Abram; He said to him: I am God Almighty; walk before Me, and be faultless” (Genesis 17:1).</b> <br>“Abram was ninety-nine years old.” “Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel, like a first fruit on the fig tree in its first season…” (Hosea 9:10) – Rabbi Yudan said: A fig tree is initially picked one fig at a time, then two at a time, then three at a time, until one picks it with baskets and rakes [at one’s side].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">At first the figs ripen individually; afterwards all the remaining figs ripen at once.</i> So, too, initially, “Abraham was one and he inherited the land” (Ezekiel 33:24), then there were two – Abraham and Isaac; then three, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and then: “The children of Israel were fruitful, teemed, increased, and grew exceedingly mighty” (Exodus 1:7). <br>Rabbi Yudan said: Just as a fig has no refuse other than its stem, just remove it and its imperfection is eliminated, so, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘You have no refuse [on your body] other than the foreskin, remove it and the imperfection is eliminated: “Walk before Me, and be faultless.”’

[“Walk before Me, and be faultless”] – Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a noblewoman to whom the king said: ‘Pass before me.’ She passed before him, and her face became flushed, [as] she said: ‘Perhaps there is some imperfection to be found in me.’ The king said to her: ‘The only imperfection you have is that the fingernail of your little finger is slightly long.

Remove it and the imperfection will be eliminated.’  <br><b>“I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly” (Genesis 17:2).</b> <br>“Walk before Me, and be faultless…I will establish My covenant between Me and you…” (Genesis 17:1–2). Rav Huna in the name of bar Kappara: Abraham sat and expounded a verbal analogy: “<i>Orla</i> is written regarding trees<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The prohibition against eating the fruit of a tree the first three years after it has been planted is called <i>orla</i> (Leviticus 19:23).</i> and “<i>orla</i>” is written regarding man;<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was expounding a verbal analogy to ascertain what God meant by <i>orla</i> – in Genesis 17:11, God says: “You shall circumcise the flesh of your <i>orla.</i>”</i> just as <i>orla </i>that is written regarding the tree is in the place that it produces fruit, so <i>orla </i>that is written regarding a person is in the place that he produces offspring.  <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pazi said to him [Rav Huna]: Were verbal analogies, then, transmitted to Abraham? That is a rhetorical question. The explanation is rather that He intimated an allusion to him: “I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly” – I will establish My covenant between Me and you in the place from which you procreate.
Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Yishmael says: Abraham was a High Priest, as it is stated: “The Lord has taken an oath and will not renounce it: You are a priest forever…” (Psalms 110:4),<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This Psalm is often expounded as a reference to Abraham.</i> and it is stated elsewhere: “You shall circumcise the flesh of your <i>orla</i>” (Genesis 17:11). [Abraham wondered,] from where should he become circumcised? If he would become circumcised from the ear,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Cutting off a piece of flesh near the ear.</i> he would be unfit to perform sacrifices; if from the mouth, he would be unfit to perform sacrifices; if from the heart, he would be unfit to perform sacrifices. From where could he become circumcised and still be fit to sacrifice? You must say, it is the <i>orla </i>of the body.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The foreskin.</i> <br>Rabbi Akiva says: There are four kinds of <i>orla</i> [in the Scriptures]. <i>Orla </i>is stated regarding the ear: “Behold their ear is blocked [<i>orla</i>]” (Jeremiah 6:10). <i>Orla </i>is stated regarding the mouth: “I am a man of obstructed [<i>aral</i>] lips” (Exodus 6:30). <i>Orla </i>is stated regarding the heart: “The entire house of Israel is uncircumcised of heart [<i>arelei lev</i>]” (Jeremiah 9:25). And <i>orla </i>is stated regarding the body: “An uncircumcised [<i>arel</i>] male” (Genesis 17:14). It was said to him: “Walk before Me, and be faultless.” If he would become circumcised from the ear, he would not be faultless; if from the mouth, he would not be faultless; if from the heart, he would not be faultless. From where could he become circumcised and be faultless? You must say, it is from the <i>orla </i>of the body. <br>Mikra<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The name of a rabbi. In manuscripts: Nakra or Nagda.</i> said: [It is written:] “One who is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations” (Genesis 17:12). If he would become circumcised from the ear, he would not be able to hear; if from the mouth, he would not be able to speak; if from the heart, he would not be able to think. From where could he become circumcised and still be able to think [and speak and hear]? This is the <i>orla </i>of the body.  <br>Rabbi Tanḥuma said: It is a logical inference from this verse: “An uncircumcised male” (Genesis 17:14). Is there such a thing as an uncircumcised female? It is, rather, [to teach you that] from the place where it is recognizable whether a person is male or female, it is there that one circumcises him.

Or, perhaps it is the reverse, “in the heat of the day” refers to the fourth hour, and “the sun grew hot and it melted” refers to the sixth hour. You must admit, however: How can you explain “in the heat of the day” to be the fourth hour? Is it not so that at the fourth hour, the heat is only in a place where the sun shines? At the fourth hour, the shade is cool while the sun is hot. At the sixth hour, the shade and the sun are equally hot. Therefore, you should not say in accordance with the second formulation, but rather like the first formulation: “In the heat of the day” refers to the sixth hour, and “the sun grew hot and it melted” refers to the fourth hour, as only in the place where the sun shone did it melt. Rabbi Tanḥuma says: It [the sixth hour] is at a time when people do not have a shadow at the bottom of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The sixth hour is at noon, when one’s shadow cannot be seen, as the sun is directly overhead.</i> <br>Rabbi Yanai said: He pierced a hole from Gehenna and heated up the entire world along with its inhabitants for a brief moment, for the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The righteous are suffering and the world is comfortable?’<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">God unleashed the heat of Gehenna for Abraham’s benefit, even though it was inconvenient for the rest of the world.</i> This teaches that heat is effective for a wound.
<b>“He lifted his eyes and he saw, and, behold, three men were standing over him; he saw and ran toward them from the entrance of the tent, and prostrated himself to the ground” (Genesis 18:2).</b> <br>He [Abraham] said: ‘Before I was circumcised, passersby would come in to me.’<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham was concerned that perhaps he would no longer have visitors (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 47:10).</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Before you were circumcised, uncircumcised people would come to you.

That was in the wilderness. In the land of Canaan, from where is it derived? “A land of streams of water, of springs and depths, emerging in the valley and on the mountain” (Deuteronomy 8:7). In the future, from where is it derived? The verse states: “On that day, spring water will emerge from Jerusalem” (Zechariah 14:8). <br>[God said:] ‘You said: “And wash your feet.” By your life, I will repay your descendants in the wilderness, in inhabited land, and in the future.’ In the wilderness, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “I bathed you in water” (Ezekiel 16:9). In inhabited land, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Wash, purify yourselves” (Isaiah 1:16). In the future, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “When the Lord will have washed the filth of the daughters of Zion” (Isaiah 4:4). <br>[God said:] ‘You said: “And recline beneath the tree.” By your life, I will repay your descendants in the wilderness, etc.,’ as it is stated: “He spread a cloud like a curtain” (Psalms 105:39). That was in the wilderness. In the Land of Israel, from where is it derived? “You shall dwell in booths seven days” (Leviticus 23:42). In the future, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “It will be a shelter for shade by day” (Isaiah 4:6). <br>[God said:] ‘You said: “And I will take a piece of bread” (Genesis 18:5). By your life, I will repay your descendants,’ etc. “The Lord said to Moses: Behold, I am raining food for you from the heavens” (Exodus 16:4). That was in the wilderness. In the Land, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “A land of wheat and barley” (Deuteronomy 8:8). In the future, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “There will be an abundance of grain in the Land” (Psalms 72:16). <br>So, it is written: “Abraham ran to the herd [and took a young bull, tender and good]” (Genesis 18:7). [God said:] ‘By your life, I will repay your descendants,’ etc.: “A wind went from the Lord, and brought over quails from the sea” (Numbers 11:31). That was in the wilderness. In the Land, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The children of Reuben…had much livestock” (Numbers 32:1). In the future, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “It will be on that day, each man will maintain [a heifer and two sheep]” (Isaiah 7:21). <br>So, it is written: “He was standing over them” (Genesis 18:8). [God said:] ‘By your life, I will repay your descendants,’ etc. “The Lord was going before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to guide them on the way” (Exodus 13:21). That was in the wilderness. In the Land, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “God stands in the assembly of the Almighty” (Psalms 82:1). In the future, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The one who breaches goes before them…[and the Lord is at their head]” (Micah 2:13).
<b>“And I will take a piece of bread, and you will sustain your heart, then depart, inasmuch as you have passed by your servant.

In the Torah, from where is it derived? “And I will take a piece of bread, and you will sustain your heart.” In the Prophets – “Sustain your heart with a piece of bread” (Judges 19:5). In the writings – “And bread sustains man’s heart” (Psalms 104:15). <br>Rav Aḥa said: “Sustain your heart [<i>levavkhem</i>]” is not written here, but rather, “sustain your heart [<i>libekhem</i>].” This teaches that the evil inclination has no authority over angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The word “heart” can be spelled with one <i>bet</i> (<i>lev</i>) or two (<i>levav</i>).

<b>“He took butter and milk, and the young bull that he had prepared, and placed it before them; he was standing over them beneath the tree, and they ate” (Genesis 18:8).</b> <br>“He took butter and milk” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: The highest quality [butter] is one-sixtieth of the milk,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The best butter is made from the creamiest one-sixtieth part of the milk.</i> the intermediate quality is one-fortieth, and the lowest quality is one-twentieth.

If the number of dotted letters is greater than the number of undotted letters, one expounds the dotted letters. Here, where the number of dotted letters is greater than the number of undotted letters, one expounds the dotted letters, [which spell out]: ‘Where is he [<i>ayo</i>] – Abraham?’ Rabbi Azarya said: Just as they said [to Abraham]: “Where is Sarah?” so they said to Sarah: ‘Where is Abraham?’ <br>“He said: Behold, in the tent” – that is what is written: “Blessed beyond women is Yael, wife of Ḥever the Kenite; beyond the women in the tent, she shall be blessed” (Judges 5:24). Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Elazar said: Beyond the women of the generation of the wilderness, who dwelled in tents, as it is stated: “Each man at the entrance of his tent” (Numbers 11:10). Why should she be more blessed than they were? They bore children and kept the world going, but what use would it have been? Were it not for her, they would have been eradicated.

Chapter 49

<b>“The Lord said: Shall I conceal from Abraham what I am doing?” (Genesis 18:17). <br>“And Abraham will become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him” (Genesis 18:18).</b> <br>“The Lord said: Shall I conceal from Abraham […and Abraham will become a great and mighty nation]” – Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “The memory of the righteous is for a blessing, and the name of the wicked will rot” (Proverbs 10:7). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who mentions a righteous man and does not pronounce a blessing for him, has violated a positive mitzva. What is the source? “The memory of the righteous is for a blessing.” And anyone who mentions a wicked man and does not pronounce a curse for him violates a positive mitzva. What is the source? “And the name of the wicked will rot.” <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The names of the wicked are similar to weaving implements.

It is written: “The secret of the Lord is [revealed] to those who fear Him, and His covenant to inform them” (Psalms 25:14). What is “the secret of the Lord”? This is circumcision,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Often referred to as <i>brit</i>, the covenant.</i> as He did not reveal it from Adam the first man until twenty generations, until Abraham arose, and He gave it to him, as it is stated: “I will establish My covenant between Me and you” (Genesis 17:2). <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘If you become circumcised, you will receive the secret [<i>sod</i>] of the Lord.’ What is the secret of the Lord? <i>Samekh</i> is sixty, <i>vav</i> is six, <i>dalet </i>is four, yielding seventy.

Even if I had I sought to do so [to destroy areas] from his own ancestral property he would not have refused. So what of it?’ [Nevertheless,] He consulted with him first. <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: This is analogous to a king who had three close friends, and he would never do anything without their knowledge. One time he wanted to do something without their knowledge. He took the first one and banished him and expelled him from the palace. The second one he incarcerated in a prison cell and placed his royal seal upon it. Regarding the third, who was exceedingly beloved to him, he said: ‘I will not do anything without consulting him.’ So, too, Adam the first man – “He banished the man” (Genesis 3:24); Noah, “the Lord shut him in” (Genesis 7:16). Regarding Abraham, who was exceedingly beloved to him, he said: ‘Could I do anything without his knowledge?’ <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is analogous to a king who had a senior adviser, and he would not do anything without his knowledge.

The Rabbis say: It refers to visiting the ill. <br>Rabbi Azarya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: Righteousness at first, and ultimately justice. How so? Abraham would take in passersby. After they ate and drink, he said to them: ‘Recite a blessing.’ They said: ‘What should we say?’ He said to them: ‘Say: Blessed is God, the Most High, whose food we have eaten.’ If he agreed to recite the blessing, he would eat, drink and go. But if he would not agree to recite the blessing, he [Abraham] would say to him: ‘Give me what you owe.’ He would say: ‘What do I owe you?’ He would say to him: ‘A cup<i> </i>of wine costs ten <i>polars</i>, a pound<i> </i>of meat costs ten <i>polars</i>, and a loaf of bread costs ten <i>polars</i>.

But they did not do so. That is what is written: “He who moves mountains and they do not know” (Job 9:5), and ultimately, “who overturns them in His wrath” (Job 9:5).
<b>“The men turned from there and went to Sodom, and Abraham was still standing before the Lord” (Genesis 18:22).</b> <br>“The men turned from there” – this teaches that angels do not have backs to their heads.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash interprets the verse to mean that the angels were still facing Abraham, even though they were already walking away from him.</i> <br>“And went to Sodom, and Abraham was still standing before the Lord” – Rabbi Simon said: This is a scribal emendation, as it was [actually] the Divine Presence that was waiting for Abraham.
<b>Abraham approached, and he said: Would You even destroy the righteous with the wicked?” (Genesis 18:23).</b> <br>“Abraham approached, and he said…” – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda says: The term approaching<i> </i>means for battle<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">To argue against God.</i> – “Yoav and the people who were with him approached Aram to battle” (I Chronicles 19:14). Rabbi Neḥemya said: Approaching<i> </i>means for conciliation, as it says: “The children of Judah approached Joshua” (Joshua 14:6).

So, “the Lord went when He concluded to speak to Abraham,” and it is written: “And Abraham returned to his place.” A prosecutor, as long as the advocate is pleading his case and the judge shows him a receptive look, he waits. When the judge stands, the advocate goes silent, and the prosecutor<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Who is also executioner.</i> goes to implement his mission. So, “the Lord went” and it is written: “The two angels came to Sodom in the evening” (Genesis 19:1). <br>

Chapter 50

<b>“The two angels came to Sodom in the evening and Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom; Lot saw them, and rose to meet them, and he prostrated himself with his face to the ground” (Genesis 19:1).</b> <br>“The two angels came to Sodom in the evening…” – “the <i>ḥayot<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A kind of angel.</i></i> were darting to [<i>ratzo</i>] and fro like the appearance of a flash” (Ezekiel 1:14). Rabbi Aivu said: <i>Ratzot<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The usual form of the verb, meaning running or darting.</i> </i>is not written here, but rather, <i>ratzo<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Which can also mean to desire.</i> </i>– they had a desire to perform their mission. “Like the appearance of a flash [<i>habazak</i>]” – Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Levi bar Parta: Like one who scatters [<i>bozek</i>] olive pomace<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Which ignites easily.</i> in an oven. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: [The <i>ḥayot</i> moved] as wind drives an [empty] wineskin. The Rabbis say: As wind drives the clouds. They [the angels] took their leave from Abraham at six hours and arrived in Sodom only in the evening?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since they move so swiftly, they should have arrived there in a matter of seconds.</i> The explanation is that they were angels of mercy, and they were tarrying, in the belief that perhaps He might find some merit for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As a result of Abraham’s intercessions.</i> When He did not find any merit for them – “the two angels came to Sodom in the evening.”
“He acts through one, and who can respond to Him? His soul desires and He performs” (Job 23:13) – it is taught: One angel does not perform two missions, and two angels do not perform one mission. Yet you say: “[The] two [angels came to Sodom]”? The explanation is that Mikhael gave his tidings<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">To Abraham and Sarah, regarding the birth of a son. This was Mikhael’s mission, and after performing it he departed, leaving two angels.</i> and departed, Gavriel was dispatched to overturn Sodom, and Refael, to rescue Lot. <br>“The two angels came to Sodom” – here it says “angels,” but elsewhere,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">When they first came to Abraham.</i> it characterizes them as “people” (Genesis 18:2). The explanation is that there, when the Divine Presence was over them, they were characterized as “people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They were overshadowed by the aura of the presence of God.</i> Once the Divine Presence departed from over them, they assumed the manifestation of angels. <br>Rabbi Tanḥuma said that Rabbi Levi said: To Abraham, whose power was great, they appeared in the image of men; to Lot, whose strength was inferior, they appeared in the image of angels. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Before they performed their mission, they are characterized as people; after performing their mission, as angels. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: This is analogous to one who assumed a position of local government from the king. Until he reached his seat of authority, he walked about as a commoner. Once he reached the seat of his authority, he walked about as a nobleman. So, until they performed their mission, they are characterized as people, after performing their mission, they are characterized as angels.
“To Sodom [<i>sedoma</i>]” – it is taught in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: Every word that requires a <i>lamed</i> at the beginning,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Indicating the preposition “to.”</i> give it a <i>heh </i>at the end:<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>heh</i> at the end of a word (as in <i>Sedoma</i>) can be used in place of a <i>lamed</i> at the beginning of the word.</i> <i>Sedoma</i>, <i>Se’ira</i>, <i>Mitzraima</i>, <i>Ḥarana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">To Sodom, to Se’ir, to Egypt, to Ḥaran.</i> But is it not written: “The wicked will return to the netherworld [<i>lishola</i>]”?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">It has both a <i>lamed </i>prefix and a <i>heh</i> suffix. If both affixes have the same meaning, how can both be used in the same word?</i> (Psalms 9:18). Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said: It means to the lowest depths in the netherworld. <br>“In the evening [<i>ba’erev</i>]” – the evening of Sodom arrived [<i>ba arba</i>]; its sun had set, and its sentence was sealed. <br>Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He judges the nations of the world only at night, when they are sleeping,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">And not engaged in sin.</i> and judges Israel only during the day, when they are engaged in mitzvot. That is what is written: “He will judge the world in righteousness. [He will administer fair judgment to the nations]” (Psalms 9:9). <br>“And Lot was sitting [<i>yoshev</i>]” – <i>yashav </i>is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning: He assumed his seat.</i> It was on that day that they appointed him the chief justice. There were five major judges in Sodom: Ketz Sheker, Rav Sheker, Rav Masteidin, Rav Naval, and Klepander.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The meanings of these names are, respectively: Ultimate in Lies, Chief of Lies, Chief Perverter of Justice, Chief Scoundrel, Abductor.</i> Lot was the chief justice of them all. When he would tell them things that were agreeable to them, they would say to him: “<i>Gesh hala</i>” (Genesis 19:9) – rise to the top. But when he would tell them things that were disagreeable to them, they would say to him: “This one came to sojourn, and he sits in judgment?” (Genesis 19:9).
<b>“He said: Behold now my lords; please turn aside to your servant’s house, stay the night, and wash your feet, and you can awaken early and go on your way. They said: No; rather, we will spend the night in the street” (Genesis 19:2).</b> <br>“Lot saw them, and rose to meet them…He said: Behold now my lords; [please turn aside]” – Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Huna, Rabbi Yudan said: [Lot was saying:] “Please turn aside” – even if I am not worthy, diverge from the ordinary practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The ordinary practice is that men of high stature do not lodge in the houses of unworthy people. </i> Rabbi Huna said: [Lot was saying:] Take a circuitous route to me, so you will not be seen coming to me. <br>“To your servant’s house, stay the night, and wash your feet” – Abraham mentioned washing [feet] before staying the night,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 18:4.</i> but Lot mentioned staying the night before washing [feet]. The explanation is that Abraham was strict regarding the dirt of idol worship;<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham thought they were idolaters, and was concerned that some of the dirt on their feet had been picked up from an idolatrous shrine, therefore he requested that they wash their feet before entering his premises.</i> therefore, he mentioned washing first.

<b>“Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from young to old, all the people from every quarter” (Genesis 19:4).</b> <br>“Before they lay down” they began asking him questions, saying to him: ‘The residents of the city, what [kind of people] are they?’ He said to them: ‘In every place there are good and wicked people; however, here they are mostly wicked.’  <br>“The men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house […all the people from every quarter]” – there was no one among them who sought to hinder them. <br><b>“They called to Lot, and said to him: Where are the men who came to you tonight?

But once they said to him: “Take them out to us, and we will be intimate with them” – for sexual relations, they said to him: “Who else do you have here [<i>po</i>]?” (Genesis 19:12) – read it as: “What else could you [possibly] have to say [<i>peh</i>]?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Peh </i>means mouth.</i> Until now, you were permitted to advocate on their behalf, from now on, you are no longer permitted to advocate on their behalf.

<b>“They said: Move aside. And they said: This one came to sojourn, and he sits in judgment? Now we will treat you worse than them. They were intensely persistent towards the man, Lot, and approached to break the door” (Genesis 19:9).</b> <br>“They said: Move aside [<i>gesh hala</i>]” – move over, go far away.  <br>“They said: This one came to sojourn, and he sits in judgment?”<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation is: He judges judgment.</i> You are coming to destroy the law that was legislated by our predecessors.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">You seek to pass judgment on our system of justice.</i> Rabbi Menaḥama in the name of Rabbi Beivai: This is what the residents of Sodom stipulated among themselves, they said: ‘Any guest who comes here, we will have sexual relations with them and take their possessions.

That is what is written: “The sun rose upon the earth and Lot came to Tzoar” (Genesis 19:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The people of Sodom also did not see the sun, but were annihilated at sunrise.</i>
“And the Lord rained down…upon Sodom…” – this is analogous to two provinces that rebelled against the king.

So, elsewhere, [regarding Israel]: “The Lord said to Moses: Behold, I am raining down food for you from the heavens” (Exodus 16:4).

“Brimstone and fire” – that is what is written: “He will rain upon the wicked burning coal [<i>paḥim</i>], fire and brimstone…” (Psalms 11:6).<i> </i>“<i>Paḥim</i>” – [this means both] coals and traps. “Fire and brimstone” – why is it that when a person smells brimstone his soul becomes unsettled? It is because it knows that it will be sentenced with it in the future, as it is stated: “[Fire and brimstone…] will be their lot [<i>menat kosam</i>]” (Psalms 11:6).

<b>“He overturned those cities, and the entire plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and the vegetation of the earth” (Genesis 19:25).</b> <br>“He overturned those cities” – Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: These five cities were situated on a single rock, and the angel extended his hand and overturned them. That is what is written: “He extends his hand to the flinty rock [<i>ḥalamish</i>]; he overturns mountains from the root” (Job 28:9). Two <i>amora’im</i> disagreed: One said: With one-fifth [<i>ḥomesh</i>] of the hand, and one said: With one-fifth of the little finger. <br>Rabbi Yehoshua said: “And the vegetation of the earth” – even the plants that were in the earth were stricken. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: To this day, if a person collects rain from the airspace of Sodom and places it in a furrow, it will not facilitate growth.
<b>“His wife looked behind him, and she became a pillar of salt” (Genesis 19:26).</b> <br>“His wife looked behind him, [and she became a pillar of salt]” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This was because she sinned with salt on that night that the angels came to Lot. What did she do? She went to all her neighbors and said to them: ‘Give me salt, as we have guests,’ and her intention was that the residents of the city should become aware of them. That is why “she became a pillar of salt.”
<b>It was when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and He sent Lot from the midst of the upheaval, as He overturned the cities in which Lot lived” (Genesis 19:29).</b> <br>“It was when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and He sent Lot” – what memory did He remember on his [Lot’s] behalf? It was the silence that he had maintained when Abraham said regarding Sarah his wife: “She is my sister” (Genesis 12:18) – He knew [this was not true], but he remained silent. <br>“From the midst of the upheaval [as He overturned the cities in which Lot lived]” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He dwelled in [all of] them.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">He spent time in all five cities.</i> The Rabbis say: He would lend them money with usury.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In that sense Lot “lived” in all five cities.

<b>“Lot ascended from Tzoar and settled on the mountain, and his two daughters with him, because he feared to live in Tzoar.

He [David] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, before I entered the cave, You performed acts of kindness for others on my behalf;<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">You spared Lot, as my forbearer, Moav, was born from him and his elder daughter.</i> now that I am situated in the cave, may it be Your will that “You will not destroy [<i>al tashḥet</i>].”’
<b>“The elder said to the younger: Our father is old, and there is no man on the earth to consort with us in the way of the world” (Genesis 19:31).</b> <br>“The elder said to the younger: Our father is old, [and there is no man on the earth]…” – because they believed that the entire world had come to an end, as in the generation of the Flood. <br><b>“Let us give our father wine to drink, and we will lie with him, and we will give life to offspring from our father” (Genesis 19:32).</b> <br>“Let us give our father wine to drink…” – Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: “We will give life to offspring from our father.” “We will give life to a child from our father” is not written here, but rather, “we will give life to offspring from our father” – that offspring that will come from another place.

[Let us give him wine]” – from where did they get wine in the cave? Because they [the people of Sodom] had a preponderance of wine, they would hide it away in caves. Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Something resembling a sample of the World to Come was provided for them,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It came there miraculously, so that Lot’s daughters could intoxicate him and have children through him, from whom David would descend.</i> just as it says: “It will be on that day,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In Messianic times.</i> that the mountains will drip with juice” (Joel 4:18).
<b>“Lot’s two daughters conceived from their father” (Genesis 19:36).</b> <br>“Lot’s two daughters conceived from their father” – Rabbi Elazar said: A woman never conceives from her initial act of intercourse. But is it not written: “Lot’s two daughters conceived from their father”? (Genesis 19:36). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: They manipulated themselves, broke their hymen, and conceived as though it were from a second act of intercourse. <br>Rav Naḥman bar Ḥanin said: Anyone who has a ravenous appetite for sexual relations will ultimately be fed his own flesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A metaphor for incest.</i> Rabbi Yudan of Gaul and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, both in the name of Rabbi Elyehoeini: We do not know whether Lot lusted after his daughters or his daughters lusted after him.

That is what is written [concerning Moav]: “I know its fury, the utterance of the Lord, and its lies [<i>badav</i>] are unfounded [<i>lo khen</i>]” (Jeremiah 48:30). Rabbi Huna bar Pappa and Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Huna said: At the beginning of Moav’s conception, it was not for the sake of licentiousness, but rather, for the sake of Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Lot’s daughters acted out of noble motives, as they thought there was no other way to repopulate the world (see section 8).</i> Thus it is stated: His offshoots [<i>badav</i>] are not like that [<i>lo khen</i>].

Chapter 52

<b>“Abraham traveled from there to the region of the south; he lived between Kadesh and Shur, and he resided in Gerar” (Genesis 20:1).</b> <br>“Abraham traveled from there to the region of the south” – Rabbi Avun began: “Indeed, a falling mountain crumbles, and a rock moves away from its place” (Job 14:18). “Indeed, a falling mountain”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This could also be translated: “One who falls from a mountain.”</i> – this is Lot, who had his downfall on a mountain.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He experienced a great spiritual downfall due to what transpired between him and his daughters on a mountain.</i> “And a rock” – this is Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Isaiah 51:1–2.</i> “Moves away from its place” – he vacated his place of abode. This was because the area of Sodom had been destroyed and travelers to and from [that area] ceased. He said: ‘What, shall I allow the practice of benevolence to cease from my house?’ So he went and pitched a tent for himself in Gerar. That is what is written: “Abraham traveled from there.”
“A treacherous brother goes from a fortified city” (Proverbs 18:19). “A brother” – this refers to Lot, who was the son of Abraham’s brother. “Treacherous…goes from a fortified city” – you betrayed Abraham,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham is the “fortified city” that had protected Lot when he was with him.</i> you denied him, you were false to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">By moving to the evil city of Sodom, thus turning against Abraham’s righteous way of life.</i> And what did it cause to you? “Ordinances like the bars of a palace” (Proverbs 18:19) – he brought ordinances upon himself like the bars of the Temple. Just as [it is stated] elsewhere, [regarding the Temple]: “Anyone impure may not enter” (II Chronicles 23:19), so, too, here: “An Amonite or a Moavite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord…forever” (Deuteronomy 23:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Lot’s abandonment of Abraham’s ways ultimately led to his fathering Amon and Moav, who were locked out of intermarrying with the assembly of the Lord.</i>
Another matter, “Abraham traveled from there” – “the wise-hearted will take mitzvot” (Proverbs 10:8). “The wise-hearted” – this refers to Abraham. “Will take mitzvot” – because the area of Sodom had been destroyed and travelers to and from [that area] ceased, and he had no shortage [of food] in his storage house. He said: ‘What, shall I allow the practice of benevolence to cease from my house?’ He went and pitched a tent for himself in Gerar. “But one with foolish lips, he will be disgraced” (Proverbs 10:8) – this refers to Lot, who was foolish with his lips, as he should have said to his daughters: ‘Are we going to perform the very act for which the world was stricken?’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Sexual immorality.</i> Instead, “he will be disgraced” – what did he cause to happen to himself? “He will be disgraced” – he brought upon himself disgrace upon disgrace. Just as it is stated elsewhere, [regarding the Temple,] “anyone impure may not enter” (II Chronicles 23:19), so, too, here: “An Amonite or a Moavite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4).
“Abraham traveled from there” – he turned away because of the stench,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The foul atmosphere of immorality that Lot had created for himself.</i> as people were saying that Lot, the son of Abraham’s brother, had consorted with his two daughters. <br>“To the region of the south” – it [the south] is called by seven names: <i>Darom</i>, <i>negev</i>, <i>teiman </i>(Joshua 12:3), <i>ḥeder</i> (Job 37:9), <i>yam </i>(Psalms 107:3), <i>yamin </i>(I Samuel 23:19), and <i>seninim </i>[variant reading: <i>sinim</i> (Isaiah 49:12)]. They raised an objection: But is it not written: “Nor from the wilderness in the <i>harim</i>”? (Psalms 75:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In that context, <i>harim</i> means the south. There is thus an eighth term used for south.</i> He said to them: That, too, is the south<i>.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Indeed, that is an eighth term for south.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: I was passing by the synagogue in Tzippori, and I heard the children sitting and reciting the verse: “Abraham traveled from there.” I said: ‘Great are the words of the Sages who said: [Warm yourself up by the fire of the Torah scholars,] but be cautious of their glowing coals so that you not be burned, as their bite is like the bite of a fox, and their hiss is like the hiss of a fiery serpent, and all their words are like fiery coals,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That is to say, their rebuke is harsh and enduring.</i> as from the moment that Abraham separated from Lot,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">When Abraham told him: “Please, part from me” (Genesis 13:9).</i> his separation was an eternal separation.’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Even now, when Lot sought to go back to Abraham (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 50:11), Abraham traveled away from him.</i> <br>“He resided in Gerar” – in Geradiki.  <br><b>“Abraham said of Sarah his wife: She is my sister.

<b>“God came to Avimelekh in a dream at night, and He said to him: Behold, you will die because of the woman that you have taken, as she is married to a husband” (Genesis 20:3).</b> <br>“God came to Avimelekh in a dream at night” – Rabbi Yosei said: The Holy One blessed be He appears to the prophets of the nations of the world only at a time that people typically have taken their leave from one another. That is what is written: “In thoughts from visions of the night,” (Job 4:13) “a matter stealthily came to me” (Job 4:12). What is the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world? Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and the Rabbis, Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: This is analogous to a king who was situated with his friend in a great hall, with a curtain placed between them. Whenever he would seek to speak with his friend, he would draw the curtain back and speak with him. But for the prophets of the nations of the world, He does not draw it back, but, rather, he speaks to them from behind the curtain. The Rabbis say: It is analogous to a king who had a wife and a concubine. When he goes to his wife, he goes publicly, but when he goes to his maidservant [the concubine], he goes clandestinely. So, the Holy One blessed be He appears to those of the nations of the world only at night: “God came to Bilam at night” (Numbers 22:20); “God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night” (Genesis 31:24); “God came to Avimelekh in a dream at night.” <br>What is the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world? Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yisakhar of Kefar Mandi, Rabbi Ḥama said: The Holy One blessed be He appears to the prophets of the nations of the world only with a truncated form of speech, as it says: “God happened [<i>vayikar</i>] upon Bilam” (Numbers 23:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash views the word <i>vayikar</i> as a truncated version of the word <i>vayikra</i> – He called, which is what is typically employed with regard to the prophets of Israel.</i> Rabbi Yisakhar of Kefar Mandi said: This expression <i>vayikar</i> is nothing other than an expression of impurity, just as it says: “If there will be among you a man who will not be pure due to an…incident [<i>mikre</i>]” (Deuteronomy 23:11). But to the prophets of Israel [He appears] with a complete form of speech, with an expression of endearment, with an expression of sanctity, with the expression with which the ministering angels laud Him, as it is stated: “And this one called to that one and said: Holy, …” (Isaiah 6:3). Rabbi Yosei ben Beiva said: “The Lord is far from the wicked” (Proverbs 15:29) – this refers to the prophets of the nations of the world; “and He hears the prayer of the righteous” (Proverbs 15:29) – this refers to the prophets of Israel. <br>“God came to Avimelekh in a dream at night, and He said to him: Behold, you will die because of the woman…” – from here we learn that there is no forewarning [necessary] for Noahides.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Noahides are all people in the world other than Jews.

Chapter 53

<b>“The Lord remembered Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken” (Genesis 21:1).</b> <br>“The Lord remembered Sarah as He had said.” That is what the verse said: “All the trees of the field will know that I, the Lord, have lowered a high tree, elevated a lowly tree” (Ezekiel 17:24) – Rabbi Yudan said: Not like those who speak but do not act, but rather, “I, the Lord, have spoken and acted” (Ezekiel 17:24). Where did He speak? “At the prescribed time, I will return to you… and Sarah will have a son” (Genesis 18:14); and He acted. <br>“All the trees of the field will know” – this refers to people, as it says: “For man is the tree of the field” (Deuteronomy 20:19). “That I, the Lord, have lowered a high tree” – this refers to Avimelekh. “Elevated a lowly tree” – this refers to Abraham. “Dried a moist tree” (Ezekiel 17:24) – this refers to Avimelekh’s wives. “Caused a dry tree to blossom” (Ezekiel 17:24) – this refers to Sarah. “I, the Lord, have spoken” – where [in Scripture] did He speak? “At the time, I will return to you.” “And acted” – that is what is written: “And the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken.”
“Will a person be more just than God? Will a man be purer than his Maker? (Job 4:17). Is it possible for a person to be more just than God? “Will a man be purer than his Maker” – is it possible for a person to be purer than his Creator? What did Elisha say to the Shunamite woman? “At this very time next year, at this very time, you will embrace a son” (II Kings 4:16). She said to him: ‘“No, my lord, man of God, do not deceive your maidservant” (II Kings 4:16). Those angels who brought the tidings to Sarah said to her: “At the prescribed time, I will return to you; at this very time next year, Sarah will have a son” (Genesis 18:14). [Why, then, do you [Elisha] not likewise promise that you will return?]’ He said to her: ‘Those angels knew that they live and endure forever, so they said: “At the time, I will return to you.” But, I, who am flesh and blood, alive today and dead tomorrow, [say to you:] whether I am alive or dead, “at this very time, you will embrace a son.”’ What is written there? “The woman conceived and bore a son at that time the next year, at that very time that Elisha had spoken to her” (II Kings 4:17). If the words of flesh and blood are fulfilled, will the words of the Holy One blessed be He not be fulfilled? “The Lord remembered Sarah as He had said…”
“For the fig tree will not blossom and there is no fruit on the vines; the produce of the olive tree will fail and the fields will yield [no food]…” (Habakkuk 3:17). “For the fig tree will not blossom” – this refers to Abraham, just as it says: “Like a first fruit on the fig tree in its first season, I saw your fathers” (Hosea 9:10). “And there is no fruit on the vines” – this refers to Sarah, just as it says: “Your wife is like a fruitful vine…” (Psalms 128:3). “The produce of the olive tree will fail [<i>kiḥesh</i>]” – those angels who brought the tidings to Sarah illuminated her face like olive [oil]. Were they then lying [<i>koḥashim</i>]?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">If "olive tree” is an allusion to the angels informing Sarah of her impending pregnancy, why does the verse refer to it as lying [<i>kiḥesh</i>]?</i> However, [Sarah said:] “the fields [<i>shedemot</i>] will yield no food” – [Sarah said:] ‘These withered breasts [<i>shedei mavet</i>] have never produced food.’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That is what caused Sarah to doubt the veracity of their tidings (see Genesis 18:12).</i> “The flock is severed from the fold” (Habakkuk 3:17) – [this refers to Israel,]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Sarah was afraid that Israel would not, in fact, descend from her, because she believed she was incurably barren.</i> just as it says: “You, My flock, flock of My pasture, you are men” (Ezekiel 34:31). “There is no cattle in the barns” (Habakkuk 3:17) – [this refers to Israel,] just as it says: “Ephraim is a trained calf that loves to thresh” (Hosea 10:11). Sarah then relented and said: ‘Am I to lose faith in my Creator? Rather, “but I will rejoice in the Lord, I will exult in the God of my salvation”’ (Habakkuk 3:18). The Holy One blessed be He said to her: ‘You have not lost your hope, I, too, will not allow your hope to be lost.’ Rather, “the Lord remembered Sarah…” <br>“The Lord remembered Sarah.” “The grass has withered, the flower has faded” (Isaiah 40:8) – the grass of Avimelekh has withered and his flower has faded. “But the word of our God will stand forever” (Isaiah 40:8) – “the Lord remembered Sarah as He had said.”
“Forever, Lord, Your word stands firm in the heavens” (Psalms 119:89) – is this to imply that it is not so on earth? It means, rather, that what You said to Abraham in the heavens [stands firm]: “At the prescribed time, I will return to you; at this very time next year, [Sarah will have a son]” (Genesis 18:14). <br>Rabbi Naḥman of Yafo in the name of Rabbi Yaakov of Caesarea began: “God of hosts, please return. Look from heaven and see, and remember this vine” (Psalms 80:15) – return and perform what You said to Abraham: “Look now toward the heavens, and count the stars” (Genesis 15:5). “Remember this vine” – “the Lord remembered Sarah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalmist was praying that God once again grant fertility and increase for Israel as He did for Abraham and Sarah.</i> <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman began: “God is not a man, that He would lie, or the son of man, that He would reconsider” (Numbers 23:19). Rabbi Shmuel said: This verse, its beginning does not correspond to its end, and its end does not correspond to its beginning. [The beginning states:] “God is not a man, that He would lie…[and the end states] He will say and not perform, speak and not fulfill” (Numbers 23:19). The explanation is that when the Holy One blessed be He decrees to bring something good upon the world, “God is not a man, that He would lie.” But when he decrees to bring something detrimental, [sometimes] “He will say and not perform, speak and not fulfill.” When He said to Abraham: “For it is through Isaac that descendants will be considered for you” (Genesis 21:12) – “God is not a man, that He would lie.” But when He said to him: “Take now your son, your only one […and offer him up]” (Genesis 22:2) – “He will say and not perform.” When the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “I have remembered you [and what has been done to you in Egypt, and I said: I shall bring you up from the affliction of Egypt] (Exodus 3:16–17) – “God is not a man, that He would lie.” When the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Let Me be, and I shall destroy them” (Deuteronomy 9:14) – “He will say and not perform.” When the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: “And also that nation [whom they will serve, I shall judge]” (Genesis 15:14) – “God is not a man, that He would lie.” But when He said to him: “They will be enslaved to them and they will oppress them [four hundred years]” (Genesis 15:13) – “He will say and not perform.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The period of subjugation in Egypt in fact lasted only two hundred and ten years.</i> When the Holy One blessed be He said to him [Abraham]: “I will surely return to you […and, behold, a son for Sarah your wife]” (Genesis 18:10) – “God is not a man, that He would lie.” Rather, “the Lord remembered Sarah.”
“The Lord remembered Sarah.” “[Lord, God of Israel …] who upheld for Your servant David, my father, what You had spoken to him” (I Kings 8:23–24). “Who upheld for Your servant” – this refers to Abraham. “What You had spoken to him” – “at the prescribed time, I will return to you.” “You spoke with Your mouth, and You fulfilled it with Your hand, on this day” (I Kings 8:24) – “the Lord remembered Sarah […and Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time that God had spoken to him]” (Genesis 21:1–2). <br>“He sets the barren woman at home, the mother of children is joyful” (Psalms 113:9). “He sets the barren woman at home” – this refers to Sarah, “Sarah was barren” (Genesis 11:30). “The mother of children is joyful” – “Sarah would nurse children” (Genesis 21:7). <br>“The Lord remembered Sarah as He had said, [and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken]”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The verse seems to be referring to two different promises made to Sarah, one being “said” to her and the other “spoken.”</i> – what He Himself had said to her<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 18:14.</i> was communicated with saying.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is addressing the different verbs employed in the verse, said [<i>amar</i>], and spoke [<i>diber</i>].</i> “The Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken” – what He had spoken to her by means of an angel.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Genesis 18:10. </i> Rabbi Neḥemya said [the opposite]: “The Lord remembered Sarah as He had said” – what He had said to her by means of an angel was with saying. “The Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken” – what He Himself had spoken to her.  <br>Rabbi Yehuda said: “As He had said” – to grant her a son. “As He had spoken” – to bless her with milk.

“The Lord remembered Sarah” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written [regarding an unfaithful wife]: “If the woman was not defiled, and is untainted, she will be absolved, and will conceive offspring” (Numbers 5:28).

<b>“Sarah said: God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh for me” (Genesis 21:6).</b> <br>“Sarah said: God has made laughter for me” – Rabbi Berekhya ben Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Shmuel ben Rabbi Yitzḥak: When Reuben is rejoicing, why should Simeon care? So, Sarah was remembered, why should others care? The explanation is that when Sarah was remembered [by conceiving], many [other] barren women were remembered [they conceived] with her, many deaf people gained their hearing, many blind people had their eyes opened, many imbeciles gained intelligence. ‘Making’ is written here<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">“God has made laughter for me.”</i> and ‘making’ is written elsewhere: “He made abatement for the provinces” (Esther 2:18).

Instead, expose your breasts, so that everyone will know that the Holy One blessed be He has begun to perform miracles.’ She exposed her breasts and they were flowing with milk like two wellsprings. Noblewomen were coming and having their children nurse from her. They were saying: ‘We are not worthy of having our children nurse from this righteous woman.’ The Rabbis and Rabbi Aḥa, the Rabbis say: Anyone who came [to Sarah] for the sake of Heaven<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">With sincere motives.</i> became God-fearing. Rabbi Aḥa said: Even one who did not come for the sake of Heaven, dominion in this world was granted to him.

<b>“The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned” (Genesis 21:8).</b> <br>“The child grew and was weaned” – Rabbi Hoshaya the Great said: He was weaned from the evil inclination. The Rabbis say: He was weaned from his milk. <br>“Abraham made a great feast” – Rabbi Yuda ben Rabbi Simon said: [This means that] the Great One of all worlds was present there. Rabbi Yudan bar Masparta said: “The king made a great feast” (Esther 2:18) – the great leaders of the world were there. That is what is written: “As the Lord will return to rejoice over you for good” (Deuteronomy 30:9) – in the days of Mordekhai and Esther, “as He rejoiced over your fathers” (Deuteronomy 30:9) – in the days of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: “A great feast” – a feast of all the great people; Og and all the great men were there. They said to Og: ‘Did you not used to say: Abraham is a like barren mule and cannot beget a child?’ He said to them: ‘Now, what is his gift [Isaac], is it not puny?

<b>“Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she bore to Abraham, playing” (Genesis 21:9). <br>“She said to Abraham: Banish this maidservant and her son, for the son of this maidservant will not inherit with my son, with Isaac” (Genesis 21:10).</b> <br>“Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian” – Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: Rabbi Akiva used to say something derogatory regarding this, but I say something complimentary regarding it. Rabbi Akiva expounded: “Sarah saw [the son of Hagar…playing [<i>metzaḥek</i>]]” – <i>metzaḥek </i>is nothing other than sexual immorality, just as it says: “The Hebrew slave whom you brought to us came to me to play with [<i>letzaḥek</i>] me” (Genesis 39:17). It teaches that our matriarch Sarah would see Ishmael force himself on women, trap married women, and violate them. <br>It is taught: Rabbi Yishmael says: This expression of <i>tzeḥok</i> is nothing other than idol worship, as it is stated: “The people sat to eat and drink and they rose to revel [<i>letzaḥek</i>]” (Exodus 32:6). It teaches that our matriarch Sarah would see Ishmael building altars, trapping grasshoppers, and sacrificing [them] upon them. <br>Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: This expression of <i>tzeḥok</i> is nothing other than an expression of bloodshed, as it says: “Let the lads rise now and play [<i>visaḥaku</i>] before us” (II Samuel 2:14). Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Ishmael said to Isaac: ‘Let us go and see our portion in the field.’ Ishmael would then take a bow and arrows and shoot toward Isaac, conducting himself as though he was [just] playing. That is what is written: “Like the prankster who shoots firebrands, [arrows, and death], so is a man who deceives his friend, and says: Am I not joking?” (Proverbs 26:18–19). <br>But I [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai] say something complimentary regarding it. This expression of <i>tzeḥok</i> is nothing other than an expression of inheritance. When our patriarch Isaac was born, everyone was rejoicing. Ishmael said to them: ‘You are fools. I am the firstborn and I will inherit twice as much.’ From Sarah’s response to Abraham: “For the son of this maidservant will not inherit with my son, with Isaac,” you may learn this.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Sarah said that the reason she wanted Yishmael banished was connected to the issue of inheritance.</i> <br>“For…will not inherit with my son” – even if he were not Isaac, and “he will not inherit…with Isaac” – even if he were not my son; all the more so “with my son, with Isaac.”
<b>“The matter was greatly distressing in Abraham’s eyes, regarding his son” (Genesis 21:11).</b> <br>“The matter was greatly distressing in Abraham’s eyes” – that is what is written: “And shuts his eyes from seeing evil” (Isaiah 33:15). <br><b>“God said to Abraham: Do not be distressed about the lad and about your maidservant; everything that Sarah says to you, heed her voice; for through Isaac will be called your descendants” (Genesis 21:12).</b> <br>“God said to Abraham: Do not be distressed…[for through Isaac will be called your descendants]” – Rabbi Yudan said: “Isaac” is not written here, but rather, “through Isaac [<i>beYitzḥak</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Part, but not all, of Isaac, as Esau is not included.</i> Rabbi Azarya in the name of bar Ḥatya: <i>Beit </i>is two – through the one who acknowledges the existence of two worlds. <br>Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Shalom said: It is written: “Remember the wonders He has performed, His signs, and the judgments of His mouth” (Psalms 105:5).

Chapter 54

<b>“It was at that time, Avimelekh and Pikhol, the captain of his army, said to Abraham, saying: God is with you in everything that you do” (Genesis 21:22).</b> <br>“It was at that time, Avimelekh and Pikhol, the captain of his army, said” – “When the Lord is pleased with the ways of a man, He will cause even his enemies to make peace with him” (Proverbs 16:7). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This refers to one’s wife, as it is stated: “The members of his household are a man’s enemy” (Micah 7:6). There was once an incident involving a woman who filed a complaint against her husband to the authorities and they beheaded him.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is to illustrate how a man’s wife can be his enemy.</i> Some say, they [subsequently] beheaded her, as well. <br>Rabbi Shmuel said: It refers to a snake.

The usual way of the world is that if a person grows up with another person, two or three years in the same city, he develops a liking for him.

“It was at that time, Avimelekh and Pikhol…said” – Rabbi Yehuda said: Pikhol was his real name.

Rabbi Abba said: It is until this point that brothers remain partners [in their inherited property]. <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: It is written: “My enemies are mighty with life” (Psalms 38:20). What was granted to Abraham after seven generations was granted to Avimelekh after three.

<b>“Abraham said: I will swear” (Genesis 21:24). <br>“Abraham reprimanded Avimelekh regarding the well of water that Avimelekh's servants had stolen” (Genesis 21:25).</b> <br>“Abraham reprimanded Avimelekh…” – Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Reprimand leads to love, as it is stated: “Rebuke a wise person, and he will love you” (Proverbs 9:8). This is consistent with [another] opinion of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, as he said: Any love that is not accompanied by reprimand is not [true] love.  <br>Reish Lakish said: Reprimand leads to peace – “Abraham reprimanded Avimelekh.” This is consistent with [another] opinion of his, as he said: Any peace that is not accompanied by reprimand is not [true] peace.  <br>“Regarding the well of water that Avimelekh’s servants had stolen [<i>gazlu</i>]” – what is a robber [<i>gazlan</i>]?<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">As opposed to a thief. </i> Bar Kappara said: It is one who steals something in public, as it says: “They robbed everyone who passed them on the road” (Judges 9:25) – just as the road is in public, so, too, robbery is in public. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai derived it from here: “You brought [as sacrifices] the stolen [<i>gazul</i>] [animal], the lame, and the ill” (Malachi 1:13) – just as lameness and illness are visible, so too, a robber [<i>gazlan</i>] is visible [when he steals]. <br>Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Reish Lakish: [If one steals] in the presence of nine people, he is a thief; in the presence of ten people, he is a robber. <br>Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Huna: One is not considered a robber until he takes something out of someone’s hand, as it is stated: “He stole [<i>vayigzol</i>] the spear from the hand of the Egyptian” (II Samuel 23:21). <br><b>“Avimelekh said: I did not know who did this matter, neither did you tell me, nor did I hear of it, other than today” (Genesis 21:26).</b> <br>“Avimelekh said: I did not know…neither did you tell me” – by means of a messenger, “nor did I hear of it, other than today.”

And it is written: “The Ark of the Lord was in the Philistine countryside seven months” (I Samuel 6:1). “And His splendor into the hand of the foe” – this refers to the priestly vestments, as it says: “You shall make holy vestments for Aaron…and for splendor” (Exodus 28:2). <br>Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak in the name of Rabbi Abba: Why were the people of Beit Shemesh stricken down?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">When the Ark, which had been seized by the Philistines, was returned to that town (see I Samuel 6:19).</i> It is because they demeaned the Ark.

Here it is stated: “They went, lowing [<i>vega’u</i>] as they went” (I Samuel 6:12), and there [in the Song of the Sea] it is stated: “As He is greatly exalted [<i>gao gaa</i>]” (Exodus 15:1). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: [They sang:] “Sing to the Lord a new song” (Psalms 98:1). The Rabbis say: [They sang:] “The Lord reigns; let the earth rejoice” (Psalms 97:1). Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: [They sang] three [songs:] “Sing to the Lord a new song” (Psalms 98:1); “Sing to the Lord all the earth” (Psalms 96:1); “The Lord reigns; peoples tremble” (Psalms 99:1).

Abraham’s herdsman were saying: ‘The well is ours,’ and the others were saying: ‘The well is ours.’ Abraham’s herdsman said to them: ‘For whichever of us the water rises by itself to water his flock, the well is his.’ When the water saw Abraham’s flock, it rose immediately. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You are a model for your descendants. Just as with you, once the water saw your flock it immediately rose, your descendants, too, when the well sees them it will immediately rise.’ That is what is written: “Then Israel sang this song: [Rise up, well]…” (Numbers 21:17).

<b>“He planted a tamarisk in Beersheba, and he proclaimed there the name of the Lord, God of the universe” (Genesis 21:33).</b> <br>“He planted a tamarisk [<i>eshel</i>] in Beersheba” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: <i>Eshel</i> is an orchard.

[It means:] Request [<i>she’al</i>] whatever you would like to request; a loaf of bread, meat, wine, eggs. Rabbi Azarya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: <i>Eshel </i>is Sanhedrin,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham set up a Sanhedrin in Beersheba.</i> just as it says: “Saul was sitting [in judgment] in Giva under the tamarisk [<i>eshel</i>] in Rama” (I Samuel 22:6). <br>According to the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya, who said <i>eshel </i>is an inn, Abraham would receive passersby. After they had eaten and drunk, he would say to them: ‘Say a blessing.’ They would say to him: ‘What shall we say?’ He would say to them: ‘Blessed is the God of the universe, whose food we have eaten.’ That is what is written: “He proclaimed there the name of the Lord, God of the universe.” <br><b>“Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines many years” (Genesis 21:34).</b> <br>“Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines many years” – more years than he stayed in Hebron.

Chapter 55

<b>“It was after these matters</b>, <b>God tested Abraham and said to him: Abraham, and he said: Here I am” (Genesis 22:1). <br>“He said: Please take your son, your only one, whom you love, Isaac, and go you to the land of Moriah, and offer him up there as a burnt offering upon one of the mountains that I will tell you” (Genesis 22:2).</b> <br>“It was after these matters, God tested Abraham.” It is written: “You have given those who fear You a banner [<i>nes</i>] to wave [<i>lehitnoses</i>], because of truth [<i>koshet</i>], Selah” (Psalms 60:6) – test [<i>nisayon</i>] after test,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This accounts for the double expression <i>nes lehitnoses</i>. Abraham, alluded to here as “those who fear You,” was subjected to test after test. </i> elevation after elevation,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Each time Abraham successfully passed one of these tests he became further elevated.</i> in order to test them in [the eyes of] the world, and in order to exalt them in [the eyes of] the world, like an ensign [<i>nes</i>] on a ship. Why to such an extent? It is because of truth [<i>koshet</i>] – so that God’s attribute of justice would be proven true in the world. If a person says to you: ‘He [God] makes wealthy whom He wishes to make wealthy, he makes poor whom he wishes, and he crowns as king whom he wishes, [all arbitrarily]; when He wished, He crowned Abraham king, when He wished, He made him wealthy,’ you can respond and say to him: ‘Are you able to do what Abraham our patriarch did?’ And when he says: ‘What did he do?’ You tell him: ‘“Abraham was one hundred years old when [his son Isaac] was born to him” (Genesis 21:5), and after all that suffering, it was said to him: “Take now your son, your only one,” yet he did not hesitate.’ That is, “You have given those who fear You a banner to wave.”
“The Lord tests the righteous, but He hates the wicked and the lover of injustice” (Psalms 11:5) – Rabbi Yonatan said: A linen producer, when his flax is inferior, he does not beat it extensively because it would break, but when his flax is of high quality, he beats it exceedingly, because it continually improves [through this process]. So, the Holy One blessed be He does not test the wicked. Why? Because they would be unable to withstand it, as it is written: “But the wicked are like the stormy sea” (Isaiah 57:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">When the wicked suffer they lash out against God.</i> Whom does He test? It is the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous,” [such as in this incident:] “It was after these matters that his master's wife [cast her eyes upon Joseph]” (Genesis 39:7).  <br>“It was after these matters” – Rabbi Yonatan said: A potter, when he wants to evaluate [the products of] his kiln, he does not test the fragile vessels. Why? It is because he would not be able to knock on one of them even once without breaking it. What does he test? The sturdy vessels, as even if he knocks on one of them several times, he will not break it. So, the Holy One blessed be He does not test the wicked, but rather, the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous.” <br>Rabbi Elazar said: This is analogous to a homeowner who had two cows, one strong and one feeble. Upon which one does he place the yoke? Is it not upon the one that is strong? So, the Holy One blessed be He tests only the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord tests the righteous.”
Another matter, “the Lord tests the righteous” – this refers to Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">As opposed to righteous people in general.</i> “It was after these matters, God tested Abraham.” <br>Rabbi Avun began: “Since governance is by the king’s word, and who can say to him: What are you doing?” (Ecclesiastes 8:4). Rabbi Avin said: This is analogous to a master who commands his disciple and says to him: “You shall not distort judgment” (Deuteronomy 16:19), but he himself distorts judgment; “you shall not show preference” (Deuteronomy 16:19), but he himself shows preference; “you shall not take a bribe” (Deuteronomy 16:19), but he himself takes a bribe; do not lend with usury, but he himself lends with usury. His disciple said to him: ‘My master, you say to me: Do not lend with usury, yet you lend with usury.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">And similarly regarding the other apparent improprieties committed by the master.</i> Is it permitted for you and prohibited for me?’ He said to him: ‘I am telling you: Do not lend with usury to an Israelite, but you may lend with usury to an idolater, as it is written: “To a stranger you may lend with interest but to your brother do not lend with interest”’ (Deuteronomy 23:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">And similarly regarding the other actions of the master. In each case there was a logical explanation for his deeds.</i> So, Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You wrote in Your Torah: “You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge” (Leviticus 19:18), yet You take revenge and You bear a grudge, as it is stated: “The Lord is vengeful and full of wrath; the Lord is vengeful to His foes, and bears a grudge against His enemies”’ (Nahum 1:2). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘I wrote in the Torah: “You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge against the members of your people” (Leviticus 19:18), but I take revenge and I bear a grudge against idolaters: “Take the vengeance of the children of Israel [upon the Midyanites]” (Numbers 31:2). [Similarly, it is stated:] “You shall not test the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 6:16) – yet “God tested Abraham.”
“After these matters [<i>devarim</i>]” – after the words [<i>devarim</i>] that were being contemplated there. Who contemplated [these words]? Abraham contemplated and said: ‘I rejoiced and caused everyone else to rejoice,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">When Isaac was born (see Genesis 21:8).</i> but I did not set aside anything [from my feast] for the Holy One blessed be He, neither a bull nor a ram.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘[I do not require your gifts. I know that] even if I would make a condition with you requiring that you sacrifice your son you would not refuse.’ According to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bereshit Rabba </i>51:2.</i> who said: [When, instead of] “God,” [it is written] “and God” – it refers to Him and His court,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">God acting in concert with the angels.</i> the ministering angels had said: ‘This Abraham rejoiced and caused everyone else to rejoice, but he did not set aside anything for the Holy One blessed be He, neither a bull nor a ram.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘[I do not require his gifts. I know that] even if I would make a condition with him requiring that he sacrifice his son, he would not refuse.’ <br>[Another interpretation,] Isaac and Ishmael were arguing with one another. This one [Yishmael] was saying: ‘I am more beloved [to God] than you are, as I was circumcised at the age of thirteen years.’ And the other one [Isaac] was saying: ‘I am more beloved [to God] than you are, as I was circumcised at eight days.’ Ishmael said to him: ‘I am more beloved because I had the ability to protest, but I did not protest.’ At that moment, Isaac said: ‘If only the Holy One blessed be He would appear to me and say to me that I should sever one of my limbs, I would not refuse.’ After this, “God tested Abraham.” <br>&lt;variant reading: ishmael said to him: ‘i am more beloved than you, as i was circumcised at age thirteen years, but you were circumcised when you were little, when it was impossible to protest.’ isaac said to him: ‘everything that you gave over<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, lent.</i> to the Holy One blessed be He amounted to three drops of blood. I, though, am thirty-seven years old now, and if He were to ask me to be slaughtered, I would not refuse.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘The hour has come.’ After this, “God tested Abraham.”&gt;
“With what shall I approach the Lord, and bow to God on High? […Shall I offer up my firstborn son for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?]” (Micah 6:6). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Although these words are [apparently] alluding to Meisha king of Moav, who took action and actually offered his son up as a burnt offering,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See II Kings 3:27.</i> in fact it is alluding only to Isaac, as it is stated: “With what shall I approach the Lord, and bow to God on High? …Does the Lord desire thousands of rams, with tens thousands streams of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression? (Micah 6:6–7). Regarding Isaac, even though no action was actually performed, He accepted it as though the deed were completed. Regarding Meisha, [though he actually performed the act,] it was not accepted before Him.
God tested [<i>nisa</i>] Abraham” – Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: He exalted him like the ensign [<i>nes</i>] on a ship. Rabbi Akiva says: He tested him in the literal sense, so that people should not say: He stunned him and confused him and he did not know what to do.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">That is why the journey to Mount Moriah took three days, to give Abraham time to consider whether or not to sacrifice his son.</i>  <br>“He said: Here I am” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: In two places Moses likened himself to Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“God called out to him from amidst the bush and said: Moses, Moses.

And he in fact merited priesthood and merited kingship. He merited priesthood, [as it is stated regarding Abraham] – “The Lord has sworn, and He will not renounce it; you are a priest forever (Psalms 110:4); [and] kingship [as the Hittites said to Abraham] – “you are a prince of God in our midst” (Genesis 23:6). Moses [also] said: “Here I am” (Exodus 3:4) – here I am [ready] for priesthood, here I am [ready] for kingship. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Do not approach [<i>tikrav</i>] here [<i>halom</i>]” (Exodus 3:5). <i>Kerav </i>is specifically a reference to the priesthood, just as it says: “The stranger who approaches [<i>karev</i>] shall be put to death” (Numbers 1:51). <i>Halom</i> is specifically a reference to kingship, just as it is stated [that David said]: “That You have brought me to here [<i>halom</i>]” (II Samuel 7:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">But in fact Moses received neither priesthood not kingship. The Midrash elaborates on only one of the two ways in which Moses compared himself to Abraham. For the other, see <i>Devarim Rabba</i> 2:7.</i>
“He said: Please take your son…” – He said to him: ‘I plead with you, “please take your son.”’ He said to Him: ‘I have two sons, which son?’ He said to him: “Your only one.” He said to him: ‘This one is the only one to his mother, and the other one is the only one to his mother.’ He said to him: “Whom you love” (Genesis 22:2). He said to him: ‘Are there partitions in one’s innards?’<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Is there any limit to a father’s love for all his sons?</i> He said to him: “Isaac” (Genesis 22:2). Why did He not reveal it [His intention] to him immediately? It was to endear it [God’s command] in his eyes, and [also] to give him reward for each and every statement. This is like the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Go you [from your land]” (Genesis 12:1) – meaning your district; “from your birthplace” (Genesis 12:1) – meaning your neighborhood; “from your father’s house” (Genesis 12:1) – meaning your father’s house; “to the land that I will show you” (Genesis 12:1). Why did He not reveal it [His intention] to him immediately? It was to endear it [God’s command] in his eyes and to give him reward for each and every statement and for each and every step. <br>Rabbi Levi bar Ḥaita said: “Go you” is written twice,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Once here, and once when God commanded Abraham to leave his homeland and go to Canaan (Genesis 12:1).</i> but we do not know which was more beloved [to God], the first or the second.

The Rabbis say: To the place where incense is offered, just as it says: “I will go to the mountain of myrrh [<i>mor</i>], and to the hill of frankincense” (Song of Songs 4:6). <br>“Offer him up there as a burnt offering” – Rabbi Yudan bar Simon said: He [Abraham] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, can there be an offering without a priest?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I have already appointed you a priest.’ That is what is written [regarding Abraham]: “You are a priest forever” (Psalms 110:4). <br>“Upon one of the mountains that I will tell you” – Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The Holy One blessed be He [at first] causes the righteous to be perplexed, and to direct their eyes toward Him [for clarification], and only then does he reveal to them the upshot of the matter. “To the land that I will show you” (Genesis 12:1) – “upon one of the mountains…”<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">God did not reveal the exact location at first, leaving Abraham wondering where it was to be.</i> Similarly, “And proclaim to it the proclamation that [I speak to you]” (Jonah 3:2).

<b>“Abraham awoke early in the morning and saddled his donkey; he took his two young men with him, and Isaac his son; he chopped wood for the burnt offering, arose, and went to the place that God told him” (Genesis 22:3).</b> <br>“Abraham awoke early in the morning and saddled his donkey” – Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: Love upsets one’s usual practice and hatred upsets one’s usual practice. Love upsets one’s usual practice, as it is written: “Abraham awoke early in the morning [and saddled his donkey]…” Did he not have several slaves [who could do this for him]? The explanation is that love upsets one’s usual practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Since Abraham was so enthused to fulfill God’s wishes, he did everything himself, including saddling the donkeys, though this was not ordinarily his practice.</i> Hatred upsets the natural order, as it is written: “Bilam arose in the morning, and saddled his donkey” (Numbers 22:21). Did he not have several slaves? The explanation is that hatred upsets one’s usual practice. Love upsets the natural order, as it is written: “Joseph harnessed his chariot, and went up toward Israel his father” (Genesis 46:29). Did Joseph not have several slaves? The explanation is that love upsets one’s usual practice. Hatred upsets the natural order, as it is written: “He [Pharaoh] harnessed his chariot” (Exodus 14:6). Did he not have several slaves? The explanation is that hatred upsets one’s usual practice. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: [God said:] ‘Let one saddling come and counteract the other saddling.’ Let the saddling that Abraham our patriarch saddled in order to go and perform the will of the Omnipresent, of Him who spoke and brought the world into being, as it is stated: “Abraham extended his hand [and took the knife to slaughter his son]” (Genesis 22:10), counteract the saddling that Bilam saddled in order to go and curse Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">It was in the merit of Abraham’s actions that Bilam’s curses were negated.</i> Let the harnessing that Joseph harnessed to greet his father come and counteract the harnessing of Pharaoh to go and pursue Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">It was in the merit of Joseph’s actions that Pharaoh’s attack on the Israelites ended in failure.</i> <br>Rabbi Yishmael taught: Let the drawn sword that Abraham our patriarch wielded, as it is stated: “Abraham extended his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son” (Genesis 22:10), counteract the drawn sword regarding which Pharaoh said: “I will draw my sword [and my hand will destroy them]” (Exodus 15:9). <br>“He took his two young men with him” – Rabbi Abahu said: Two people acted with propriety,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">It is proper for a man of stature to take two attendants along on a journey. </i> Abraham and Saul.

The Rabbis and Rabbi Levi, the Rabbis say: It was by the merit of the third day on which the Torah was given, as it is stated: “It was on the third day, when it was morning” (Exodus 19:16). Rabbi Levi said: It was due to the merit of the third day of Abraham our patriarch, as it is stated: “On the third day, [Abraham lifted his eyes].”  <br>“And saw the place from a distance” – what did he see?

<b>“Abraham said to his young men: You stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go to there; we will prostrate ourselves, and we will return to you” (Genesis 22:5).</b> <br>He said to Isaac: ‘Do you see what I see?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to his two young men [his attendants]: ‘Do you see what I see?’ They said to him: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Since the donkey does not see it and you do not see it: “You stay here with the donkey.”’  <br>From where is it derived that slaves are likened to an animal?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In that they are considered to have no familial ties.</i> It is from here: “Stay here with the donkey [<i>im haḥamor</i>]” – the people [<i>am</i>] of the donkey [<i>haḥamor</i>].

<b>“Abraham extended his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son” (Genesis 22:10).</b> <br>“Abraham extended his hand and took the knife” – Rav asked Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: ‘From where is it derived that [according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi] slaughter must be performed with an object that is movable?’<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Something that is not attached to the ground.</i> [Rabbi Ḥiyya replied: ‘Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi learned it] from here: “Abraham extended his hand.”’<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that the object used for slaughtering must be capable of being taken up in the hand.</i> He [Rav] said to him: ‘If he [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi] said this to you as a<i> </i>homiletical<i> </i>interpretation, it is possible that he retracted his teaching;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi retracted his teaching that slaughtering must be done with an object that is not connected to the ground.</i> but if [he said it to you] as an actual derivation, he has not retracted his teaching.’ It is as Levi taught: If they were attached [to the ground] from the outset, they are invalid [for slaughter], but if they were detached and then were re-attached they are valid, as we learn in the Mishna:<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Ḥullin</i> 1:2.</i> One who slaughters with a hand sickle, with a harvest sickle, with a flint, or with a reed, his slaughter is valid.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the reed is attached to the ground.

Another matter, Rabbi Yitzḥak said: When Abraham sought to bind Isaac his son, he said to him: ‘Father, I am a young man, and I am concerned that my body will tremble due to fear of the knife, and I will [thereby] upset you, or perhaps the slaughter will [thereby] be rendered unfit and it will not be counted for you as a valid offering.

Nevertheless, his heart was joyful in fulfilling the will of his Creator. The angels gathered themselves into groups up above.

This is bewildering.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘“I will not violate My covenant, nor alter the utterance of My lips” (Psalms 89:35) – when I said to you: “Take you your son,” I did not say: “Slaughter him,” but rather, “take him up.” I said this to you in affection. You have taken him up and fulfilled My words, now take him down.’ <Variant reading: They said a parable; this is analogous to a king who said to his friend: ‘Bring your son up to [eat at] my table.’ He brought him to him, knife in hand. The king said: ‘Did I say to bring him up in order to eat him? I said: Bring him up out of affection for him.’ That is what is written: “[They built altars on which to burn their sons and daughters in fire, something that I never commanded] and which never entered my mind” (Jeremiah 19:5) – this refers to Isaac.>
<b>“Abraham lifted his eyes and saw that behold, there was a ram, after this, which had been caught in the thicket by its horns.

May it be Your will, Lord our God, when Isaac’s descendants encounter transgressions and wicked deeds, may this binding [of Isaac] be remembered for them, and may You become filled with mercy towards them.’ <br>Abraham called it [Jerusalem] Yireh, as it is stated: “Abraham called the name of that place The Lord will see [<i>yireh</i>].” Shem called it Shalem, as it is stated: “Malki Tzedek<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">He is identified with Shem.</i> king of Shalem” (Genesis 14:18). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I call it <i>Yireh</i>, as Abraham called it, Shem, a righteous man, will have a complaint. If I call it Shalem, Abraham, a righteous man, will have a complaint. Instead, I shall call it Yerushalayim, as both of them called it, – <i>Yireh</i>, Shalem – Yerushalayim.’ <br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: While it was still called Shalem, the Holy One blessed be made Himself a provisional booth [<i>sukka</i>] and He would pray in it, as it is stated: “His abode [<i>sukko</i>] was in Shalem, His dwelling place in Zion” (Psalms 76:3). What did He say [in His prayers?] May it be My will that I will see construction of My [permanent] house [here]. <br>Another interpretation, this teaches that the Holy One blessed be He showed him [Abraham] the [future] Temple as built,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew text in most editions has “destroyed, then built, then destroyed, then built,” but this is a textual error and the extra words should be deleted (<i>Yefeh Toar</i>). </i> then destroyed and then built, as it is stated: “The name of that place The Lord will see [<i>yireh</i>]” – that refers to the Temple built, just as it says: “Three times in the year [all your males] shall appear [<i>yeraeh</i>]” (Deuteronomy 16:16). “As it is said to this day: On the mount where the Lord” – that refers to the Temple destroyed, as it is stated: “On Mount Zion that is desolate” (Lamentations 5:18). “The Lord will be seen” – [that refers to the Temple] built and perfected in the future, like the matter that is stated: “For the Lord has rebuilt Zion and is seen in His glory” (Psalms 102:17).
<b>“The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from the heavens” (Genesis 22:15). <br>“He said: I swear by Myself, the utterance of the Lord, that because you have done this matter, and did not withhold your son, your only one” (Genesis 22:16).</b> <br>“The angel of the Lord called…a second time…He said: I swear by Myself” – what need was there for this oath? He [Abraham] said to Him: ‘Take an oath to me that you will not test me again from now on, nor Isaac my son.’ This is analogous to one who jumped from the bank of a stream, over the current, and took his son along with him as he jumped.  <br>Another interpretation, what need was there for this oath? Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina: He said to Him: ‘Take an oath to me that You will not test me again from now on.’ This is analogous to a king who was married to a noblewoman. She bore for him a first son, and he divorced her. [He remarried her and she bore him] a second son, and he divorced her, a third son, and he divorced her. When she bore a tenth son for him, all of them gathered together and said to him: ‘Take an oath to us that you will not divorce our mother from now on.’ So, too, when Abraham our patriarch was tested with the tenth ordeal,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The binding of Isaac was the tenth and last of Abraham’s tests (see Mishna <i>Avot</i> 5:3).</i> he said to Him: ‘Take an oath to me that You will not test me again from now on.’ <br>Rabbi Ḥanin said: “That because you have done this matter” – this was the tenth test, and yet you say [when reading the verse]: “That because you have done this matter”? The explanation is that this final ordeal is equal in importance to all the others combined, as had he not accepted it upon himself, he would have lost everything <variant reading: Everything that he had done.> <br><b>“For that I will bless you and multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand that is upon the seashore, and your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies” (Genesis 22:17).</b> <br>“For that I will bless you [<i>varekh avarekhekha</i>]…” – [the doubling of the verb indicates] a blessing for the father, a blessing for the son. “And multiply [<i>veharba arbeh</i>]” – multiplication for the father, multiplication for the son. <br>“And your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies” – this refers to Tarmod.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The people of Tarmod were implacable enemies of the Jews.</i> Fortunate are all those who will witness the downfall of Tarmod, as it was a partner to the two destructions [of the Temples].

This is analogous to a woman who became wealthy from plying her spindle. She said: ‘Since it was from this spindle that I became wealthy, it will never depart from my possession’. So, Abraham said: ‘Everything that has come into my possession is only because I engaged in Torah and mitzvot. That is why I do not want it to depart from my children forever.’ <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: He sent him at night<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham did not bring Isaac back with him, but told him to travel later on, at night.</i> due to the evil eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">He did this so that the evil eye would not affect Isaac in the wake of the miracle that was performed on his behalf.</i> [Similarly, we find] that from the moment that Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya emerged from the fiery furnace, their names are not mentioned again.

Rabbi Elazar said: They died because of the spittle.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">After they survived, all the gentiles mocked Israel and spat at them, saying: ‘You have a God capable of such miracles, and yet you worship idols?’ God took the lives of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya so that Israel would no longer be mocked by the gentiles.</i> Rabbi Yosei said: They died from the [evil] eye. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: They relocated and went to Yehoshua ben Yehotzadak to learn Torah from him. That is what is written: “Hear now, Yehoshua the High Priest, you and your colleagues who sit before you, [for they are men of wonders]” (Zechariah 3:8).

<b>“It was after these matters, that it was told to Abraham, saying: Behold, Milka, she too has borne children to your brother Naḥor” (Genesis 22:20).</b> <br>“It was after these matters, it was told to Abraham, saying: Behold, Milka…has borne children.” It is written: “The life of good tidings heals the heart, and envy is the rot of bones” (Proverbs 14:30) – while he [Abraham] was still at Mount Moriah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Where he had come so close to losing Isaac.</i> he received tidings that the [future] spouse of his son was born, as it is stated: “Behold, Milka, too, has borne … .”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">One of Milka’s descendants was Rebecca.</i> <br>“It will be healing for your navel, and an elixir for your bones” (Proverbs 3:8) – while he was still at Mount Moriah he received tidings that the [future] spouse of his son was born,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The navel is symbolic of the connection from one generation to the next.</i> as it is stated: “Behold, Milka, she too has borne children.”
“Like cold water on a weary soul is good tidings from a distant land” (Proverbs 25:25) – we learned there in a mishna: Upon rainfall and upon hearing good tidings, one recites the blessing: ‘Blessed [are You]…Who is good and Who bestows good.’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Berakhot </i>54a.</i> Why did they see fit to juxtapose good tidings to rainfall? Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: It is based on: “Like cold water on a weary soul is good tidings from a distant land” – just as over “good tidings” [one recites:] ‘Blessed [are You]…Who is good and bestows good,’ so, too, over “cold water” [one recites:] ‘Blessed [are You]…Who is good and bestows good.’ <br>Another interpretation, “Like cold water on a weary soul,” so is “good tidings from a distant land” – this refers to Abraham, who, while he was still at Mount Moriah, received the tidings that the [future] spouse of his son was born, as it is stated: “Behold, Milka, she too has borne…”
“It was after these matters [<i>devarim</i>]” – after the words [<i>devarim</i>] that were being contemplated there. Who contemplated [these words]? Abraham contemplated and said: ‘Had he [Isaac] died on Mount Moriah, would he not have died childless? Now, what am I going to do? I am going to marry him off to one of the daughters of Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham’s Canaanite allies (see Genesis 14:13, 14:24).</i> who are righteous.

You find that the sum of Job’s years was exactly two hundred and ten years, and Israel spent two hundred and ten years in Egypt. Satan came [before God] to present accusations [against Israel],<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">For worshiping idols while they were in Egypt.</i> but He incited him instead against Job. <br>Rabbi Ḥananya son of Rabbi Aḥa said: This is analogous to a shepherd who was standing and watching over his flock.

[No, he did not change his opinion.] What did he mean by: [Job] did not exist at all? [He meant only that] he did not actually experience the suffering that was written about him. Why, then, was it written about him? The intent was to say that if it had befallen him, he would have been able to withstand it. <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He [Job] was one of those who came up from the [Babylonian] exile. He was an Israelite, and he had a Torah academy in Tiberias.

That is what is written: “Job rose, and he rent his robe” (Job 1:20) – from here we learn that a person must rend his garments while standing. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: He was [not an Israelite, but] a gentile.

“The sun rises and the sun sets” (Ecclesiastes 1:5) – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Do we not know that the sun rises and the sun sets? The meaning is, however, that before the Holy One blessed be He causes the sun of a righteous person to set, he causes the sun of his righteous counterpart to rise. The day that Rabbi Akiva died, Rabbeinu [Yehuda HaNasi] was born, and they applied this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” On the day that Rabbeinu died, Rav Ada bar Ahava was born, and they applied this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” On the day that Rav Ada bar Ahava died, Rabbi Avun was born, and they applied this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” On the day that Rabbi Avun died, his son Rabbi Avun was born. On the day that Rabbi Avun died, Abba Hoshaya of Teriya was born. On the day Abba Hoshaya died, Rabbi Hoshaya was born, and they applied this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” <br>Before He caused Moses’ sun to set, He caused Joshua’s sun to rise, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: Take you Joshua, the son of Nun […and lay your hands upon him]” (Numbers 27:18).

Chapter 59

<b>“Abraham was old, advanced in years, and the Lord blessed Abraham with everything” (Genesis 24:1).</b> <br>“Abraham was old, advanced in years.” It is written: “Gray hair is a crown of glory; it will be found in the way of righteousness” (Proverbs 16:31). Rabbi Meir went to Mamla, he saw that they were all dark-haired. He said: ‘Are you, perhaps, all from the house of Eli, as it is written: “All those raised in your house will die as young men”?’ (I Samuel 2:33). They said to him: ‘Rabbi, pray for us.’ He said to them: ‘Go and engage in acts of righteousness and you will merit old age.’ What is his source? “Gray hair is a crown of glory.” And where can it be found? “It will be found in the way of righteousness.” From whom can you learn this? From Abraham, in whose regard it is written: “[For I love him, so that he will command his children and his household after him,] that they observe the way of the Lord, to perform righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19). He merited old age – “Abraham was old, advanced in years.”
“Might and grandeur are her garb, and she laughs to the final day” (Proverbs 31:25). “Might and grandeur are her garb” – of Torah;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Those who faithfully uphold the Torah are blessed with the “garb” of might and grandeur.</i> “and she laughs to the final day” – when does she laugh? It is in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the World to Come, the righteous who upheld the Torah will rejoice.</i> From whom can you learn this? From Abraham. Because it is written in his regard: “[For I love him, so that he will command his children and his household after him,] that they observe the way of the Lord, to perform righteousness,” (Genesis 18:19), he merited old age – “Abraham was old, advanced in years.” <br>“Length of days is on its right; on its left, is wealth and honor” (Proverbs 3:16). “Length of days is on its right”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">On the right side of the Torah.</i> – in the World to Come;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is the preferable form of reward for those who uphold the Torah, as if it is on the right side of the Torah.</i> “on its left is wealth and honor” – in this world.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The less preferable form of reward, as if, on the Torah’s left side, is success in this world.</i> Even if He comes to grant man [reward] in a left-handed fashion,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a reward in this world.</i> the person receives wealth and honor. From whom do you derive this? From Abraham. Because it is written in his regard: “[For I love him, so that he will command his children and his household after him,] that they observe the way of the Lord, to perform righteousness and justice,” (Genesis 18:19), he merited old age – “Abraham was old, [advanced in years, and the Lord blessed Abraham with everything].”
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “Even when I am old and gray, God, do not forsake me” (Psalms 71:18) – Rabbi Aḥa said: Are old age and gray hair not synonymous? The explanation is that [David was saying:] ‘If You grant me old age, grant me gray hair.’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Grant me the visage of old age, which commands the respect due to older people.</i> From whom can you learn this? From Abraham.

Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak began: “One who pursues righteousness and kindness [will find life, righteousness, and honor]” (Proverbs 21:21). Upon the death of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, who used to dance [at weddings] with three myrtle branches,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He would juggle the branches to entertain the bride and groom.</i> winds and storms emerged that uprooted all the good trees in the Land of Israel. Why was that? Because he used to pick branches from them with which to dance before the bride.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The storms that uprooted the trees were a sign that the very forces of nature were mourning his death.</i> The Rabbis would say: ‘Why does he act like this? Why does he demean the honor of the Torah?’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is not befitting for a Torah scholar of such esteem to perform this kind of entertainment.</i> Rabbi Ze’eira said: ‘Leave him, as he knows what he is doing.’ When he died, they went out to bestow kindness upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A common expression meaning that they went to his funeral, and eulogized him.</i> A fiery branch descended and assumed the shape of a myrtle branch, and interposed itself between the bier and the congregation. They said: ‘See this elder, who used to rise up and exert himself [in doing mitzvot], so a [fiery] branch rose up for him.’  <br>Alternatively, “one who pursues righteousness” (Proverbs 21:21) – this is Abraham. “[For I love him, so that he will command his children and his household after him,] that they observe the way of the Lord”; “and kindness…” (Genesis 18:19), as cited above.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba </i>58:9.</i>

This refers to Abraham, [who experienced spiritual elevation atop Mount Moriah, where God told him:] “Now I know that you are God fearing” (Genesis 22:12). “Who will stand [<i>yakum</i>] in His holy place?” (Psalms 24:3) – this refers to Abraham, as it is stated: “Abraham arose [<i>vayakom</i>] early in the morning, to go to the place” (Genesis 19:27). “Clean of hands and pure of heart” (Psalms 24:4) – “[Abram said to the king of Sodom: I have raised my hand to the Lord…] that neither a thread nor a shoelace [nor anything of yours shall I take]” (Genesis 14:22–23); “and pure of heart” – [for he said to God:] “Far be it from You to do something like this, [to put the righteous to death along with the wicked]” (Genesis 18:25). “Who has not taken a soul in vain” (Psalms 24:4) – this refers to Nimrod’s soul;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham slew Nimrod, but it was not without justification, because Nimrod was pursuing him to kill him.</i> “nor taken an oath deceitfully” (Psalms 24:4) – “I have raised my hand to the Lord, God Most High” (Genesis 14:22). “He will receive the blessing of the Lord, and righteousness [from the God of his salvation]” (Psalms 24:5) – “Abraham was old…and the Lord blessed Abraham with everything.”  <br>Abraham was the source of blessing for everyone, as it is stated: “[All the families of the earth] shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3). Who was the source of blessing for Abraham? The Holy One blessed be He was his source of blessing – “the Lord blessed Abraham with everything.” Moses was the source of miracles for Israel, as it is written: “With all the signs and the wonders…that Moses performed” (Deuteronomy 34:11–12). Who was the source of miracles for Moses? It was the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Moses built an altar and called its name; The Lord Is My Miracle” (Exodus 17:15). <br>David was Israel’s shepherd, as it is stated: “You will shepherd My people Israel” (I Chronicles 11:2). Who was David’s shepherd? It was the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want” (Psalms 23:1). <br>Jerusalem is the source of light for the world, as it is stated: “Nations will walk by your light” (Isaiah 60:3). Who is the source of light for Jerusalem? It is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is written: “The Lord will be an eternal light for you” (Isaiah 60:19).

The Holy One blessed be He provided illumination for him every place that he would go. “Let him trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God” (Isaiah 50:10) – “[You called his name Abraham,] and You found his heart faithful before You” (Nehemiah 9:7–8). <br>Another interpretation, “Who among you fears the Lord” – this is Eliezer; “who heeds the voice of His servant…” – [he heeded] the voice of Abraham who was the servant of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “For the sake of My servant, Abraham” (Genesis 26:24). “Who walked in darkness” – when he went to bring Rebecca. “And there was no light for him” – and who provided illumination for him? The Holy One blessed be He provided illumination for him, with shooting stars and lightning. “Let him trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God” – “He said: Lord, God of my master Abraham, please arrange it for me today.”
It is written: “A wise servant will dominate a shameful son and will share in an inheritance among brothers” (Proverbs 17:2). “A wise servant” – this refers to Eliezer. What was his wisdom?

Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him: “It was before he concluded to speak, and behold, Rebecca was coming out…”  <br>Caleb said: “Whoever smites Kiryat Sefer and captures it, I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife” (Judges 1:12). What if some slave would have conquered it, would he have given him his daughter? Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him, as it is stated: “Otniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s…brother, captured it; and he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife” (Judges 1:13). <br>Saul said: “It shall be, that whichever man smites him [Goliath], the king will enrich him with great wealth, and he will give him his daughter as a wife” (I Samuel 17:25).

“It was before he concluded to speak” – Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: There are three people who were answered [in their prayers] as soon as they spoke: Abraham’s servant Eliezer, Moses, and Solomon. Eliezer – “it was before he concluded to speak, and behold, Rebecca was coming out.” Moses, as it is written: “It was, as he concluded to speak all these words, the ground that was beneath them split” (Numbers 16:31).

Chapter 61

“Abraham took another wife, and her name was Ketura” (Genesis 25:1).</b> <br>“Abraham took another wife, and her name was Ketura.” It is written: “Happy is the man who has not walked…” (Psalms 1:1). “Who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked” (Psalms 1:1) – this [“the wicked”] refers to the generation of the Dispersion. “Has not stood in the path of sinners” (Psalms 1:1) – these are the people of Sodom, as it is stated: “The people of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful to the Lord” (Genesis 13:13). “And has not sat [<i>yashav</i>] in the company of the insolent one” (Psalms 1:1) – this refers to Avimelekh,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He is considered insolent because after expelling Abraham he said to him: “In accordance with the kindness that I have shown you” (Genesis 21:23).</i> as it is stated: “Behold my land is before you, [dwell [<i>shev</i>] wherever it suits you]…” (Genesis 20:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham did not accept Avimelekh’s offer to dwell near him.</i> “But whose desire is the Torah of the Lord” (Psalms 1:2) – “For I love him, so that he will command [his children and his household after him that they keep the way of the Lord]…” (Genesis 18:19). “And he meditates on His Torah” (Psalms 1:2) – Rabbi Shimon said: He [Abraham] had no father to teach him, and he did not have a teacher. From where, then, did he learn Torah? The answer is that the Holy One blessed be He set his two kidneys [<i>kilyotav</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The kidneys were considered the seat of thought in the body.</i> as two teachers of a sort, and they would flow forth and teach him Torah and wisdom. That is what is written: “I bless the Lord who counsels me, even on nights when my thoughts [<i>khilyotai</i>] are anguished” (Psalms 16:7). “He will be like a tree planted” (Psalms 1:3) – the Holy One blessed be He planted him in the Land of Israel. “Which brings forth its fruit in season” (Psalms 1:3) – this refers to Ishmael. “And whose leaf does not wither” (Psalms 1:3) – this refers to Isaac. “And whatever he does will prosper” (Psalms 1:3) – this refers to the sons of Ketura, as it is stated: “Abraham took another wife, and her name was Ketura.”
“Planted in the House of the Lord, they blossom in the courts of our God. They will continue to yield fruit even in old age” (Psalms 92:14–15) – this refers to Abraham our patriarch. “They will remain full and fresh” (Psalms 92:15) – “Abraham took another [wife].” <br>“For the tree has hope” (Job 14:7) – Abraham our patriarch has hope. “If it is hewed [<i>yikaret</i>], it will yet regenerate” (Job 14:7) – if He will say to him: ‘Perform [<i>kerot</i>] the covenant [of circumcision],’ “it will yet regenerate” – [he constantly increased his performance of] mitzvot and good deeds. “And its roots will not cease” (Job 14:7) – this refers to his [Abraham’s] vitality.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">After his circumcision he went on to produce a child, Isaac.</i> “If its root grows old in the earth” (Job 14:8) – “Abraham was old” (Genesis 24:1). “And its trunk dies in the dirt” (Job 14:8) – “Sarah died”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">And was buried in the earth.</i> (Genesis 23:2). “It will blossom from the scent of water” (Job 14:9) – due the scent of mitzvot and good deeds, he will blossom.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Because of his virtuous behavior, he was enabled to father more children in his old age.</i> “And produce branches” (Job 14:9) – “[branches] of a sapling” is not written here, but rather, “[branches] like a sapling” – the addition is greater than the tree itself: “Abraham took another [wife]…”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">And through this new wife he produced even more offspring than he had previously.</i>

He said to them: ‘My sons, the previous students died only because they were miserly toward one another. See to it that you do not act in accordance with their actions.’ They arose and filled the entire Land of Israel with Torah knowledge.  <br>Rabbi Dostai in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: If you had children in your youth, take a wife in your old age and produce [more] children.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is another interpretation of the Ecclesiastes verse: “In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not rest your hand.”</i> From whom do you learn this?

<b>“She bore him Zimran, and Yokshan, and Medan, and Midyan, and Yishbak, and Shuaḥ” (Genesis 25:2). <br>“Yokshan begot Sheva and Dedan;</b> a<b>nd the sons of Dedan were Ashurim, Letushim, and Le’umim” (Genesis 25:3).</b> <br>Rami bar Yeḥezkel said: Zimran – [he was called this] because they [his descendants] would “prune [<i>mezamrin</i>]” the world [of its inhabitants];<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">They were fierce warriors and killed many people.</i> Yokshan – because they acted with ferocity [<i>mitkashin</i>] in the world.

<b>“Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac” (Genesis 25:5). </b> <br>“Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac” – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda said: [He gave him] the rights of a firstborn son.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Even though Yishmael was older than him.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: The power to bless.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 39:11.</i> The Rabbis said: The right to burial [in the Makhpela Cave], and a will.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In which he bequeathed all his property to Isaac.</i>  <br>Rabbi Ḥama said: It was not blessings that he [Abraham] bequeathed to him, but gifts. This is analogous to a king who had an orchard, which he gave over to a sharecropper. In it, there were two trees intertwined into a single twining; one produced life-giving [fruits] and the other produced poisonous [fruits]. That sharecropper said: ‘If I water the one that is life-giving, the one that is poisonous will be watered along with it, but if I refrain from watering the poisonous one, how will the one that is life-giving survive?’ He then said: ‘I am a mere [temporary] sharecropper. I have performed my duties as sharecropper, and whatever the owner of the orchard wishes to do, he will do.’ So, Abraham said: ‘If I bless Isaac, my son Ishmael and Ketura’s sons will want to be included. If I do not bless Ishmael’s sons and Ketura’s sons, how can I bless Isaac?’ He then said: ‘I am flesh and blood, here today, in the grave tomorrow. I have already done my part; from here on, what the Holy One blessed be He wishes to do in His world, let Him do.’ When Abraham died, the Holy One blessed be He revealed himself to Isaac and blessed him.

<b>“But to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, during his lifetime, eastward, to the east country” (Genesis 25:6).</b> <br>“But to the sons of the concubines…” – In the days of Alexander of Macedonia, the children of Ishmael came to lodge a claim against Israel regarding the birthright. Two evil families, the Canaanites and the Egyptians, came with them. They [the rabbis] said: ‘Who will go and contend with them?’ Gevia ben Kosem said: ‘I will go and contend with them.’ They told him: ‘Be careful that you do not cede the Land to them.’ He said: ‘I am going to contend with them; if I am victorious, it is well and good, and if not, you can always say: Who is this lowly person, that he should represent us?’ He went and contended with them. Alexander of Macedonia said to them: ‘Who is lodging a claim against whom?’ The Ishmaelites said: ‘We are lodging a claim against them [Israel], and it is on the basis of their own Torah that we come against them. It is written: “Rather, he shall acknowledge the firstborn, son of the hated wife [to give him a double portion]” (Deuteronomy 21:17). By right, Ishmael is entitled to receive a double portion.’ Gevia ben Kosem said to him: ‘My lord the king, may a person not do as he pleases for his owns sons?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘Is it not written: “Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac”?’ (Genesis 25:5). They said to him: ‘Where is the document of gifts that he divided among his sons?’ He said to them: “And to the sons of the concubines of Abraham, Abraham gave gifts.” They departed from there shamefacedly. <br>The Canaanites said: ‘It is on the basis of their own Torah that we come against them. It is written everywhere: “To the land of Canaan,” “the land of Canaan” – let them give us back our land.’ Gevia ben Kosem said to them: ‘My lord the king, may a person not do as he pleases with his slave?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘What is written? “Cursed is Canaan, a slave of slaves….

Rabbi Yehuda said: Anyone in whose regard “expiring” is stated, died of intestinal illness. <br>It is written: “Might and grandeur are her clothing, [and she rejoices at the final day]” (Proverbs 31:25) – the entire reward granted to the righteous is prepared for them in the future, and the Holy One blessed be He shows them the granting of the reward that he is destined to give them in the future while they are still in this world, and their souls are satisfied [with what they have seen], and they go to sleep, [i.e., expire peacefully]. <br>Rabbi Elazar said: This is analogous to a feast that the king prepared. He invited the guests [beforehand] and showed them what they would be eating and drinking. Their souls were satisfied, and they went to sleep [with this feeling of satisfaction]. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He shows the righteous the granting of their reward that he is destined to give them in the future while they are still in this world, and they go to sleep, as it is stated: “For now, I would lie down and be silent. [I would sleep; then there would be rest for me]” (Job 3:13) – this shows that at the moment of the departure of the righteous [from this world], the Holy One blessed be He shows them the reward granted to them. <br>When Rabbi Abahu was dying, he was shown thirteen rivers of [precious] balsam oil. He asked: ‘Whose are these?’ They said to him: ‘Yours.’ He said: ‘These are for Abahu? “And I had said: For nothing I labored, I expended my strength for emptiness and futility; but indeed, my portion is from the Lord”’ (Isaiah 49:4). <br>Zavdi ben Levi, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and Rabbi Yosei ben Parta, the three of them recited these verses as they were dying. One of them said: “For this, everyone who is devoted to You should pray at the time of finding” (Psalms 32:6); “For our heart rejoices in Him…” (Psalms 33:21). Another said: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies” (Psalms 23:5); “But let all who take refuge in You rejoice” (Psalms 5:12). Another said: “For one day in Your courtyard is better than one thousand” (Psalms 84:11). The Rabbis say: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20). All this shows that at the moment of the departure of the righteous from the world, the Holy One blessed be He shows them the reward granted to them. <br>Ben Azai says: “Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His devoted ones” (Psalms 116:15). When does the Holy One blessed be He show them the reward that is prepared for them?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">When does He show them how precious they are in His eyes?</i> It is adjacent to their death. That is what is written: “the death of His devoted ones.” That is why: “And she rejoices at the final day” (Proverbs 31:25). <br>What is the difference between the death of youths and the death of the elderly? Rabbi Yehuda said: A lamp, when it becomes extinguished on its own, [when the oil has run out,] it is good for it and good for the wick. But when it does not become extinguished on its own, [and there is still oil in it,] it is bad for it and bad for the wick. Rabbi Abahu said: A fig, when it is picked at its proper time, it is good for it and good for the fig tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is why the Torah makes a point of writing that Abraham died “at a good old age, aged and content.”</i> But when it is picked not at its proper time, it is bad for it and bad for the fig tree.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If a person dies in ripe old age, this is the natural course of things, but if he dies young, before his time, it is unnatural and detrimental to his soul, which was not able to reach its full potential.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and his students – and some say it was Rabbi Akiva and his students, and others say it was Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta and his students – had the routine that they would come early in the day and sit and study beneath a certain fig tree. The owner of the fig tree would come early each day and pick its fruit. They said: ‘Is he, perhaps, suspicious of us?’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Is that why he keeps coming by when we are here?</i> What did they do? They changed their place. He went to them and said to them: ‘My masters, the one mitzva that you sat and afforded me, that you were sitting and studying beneath my fig tree, you have deprived me of it.’ They said to him: ‘We had said that perhaps you were suspicious of us.’ He reassured them and they returned to their place. What did he do? He woke up early in the morning, but he did not go to pick the fruit.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He refrained from picking the fruit while they were there, as he did not want to make them feel that he suspected them.</i> The sun shone upon it [the tree] and they [the figs] became infested with worms. They said: ‘The owner of a fig tree knows when it is the proper time to harvest the fig tree, and he picks its fruits [at that specific time]. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He knows when it is the proper time for the righteous to depart from the world and he removes them [at that specific time].’ That is what is written: “My beloved descended to his garden, to the beds of fragrant plants, [to eat in the gardens, to pluck lilies]” (Song of Songs 6:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Beloved One in Song of Songs refers to God. Plucking the lilies is a metaphor for removing the righteous from this world.</i> <br>“At a good old age [<i>beseiva</i>]” – Reish Lakish said: There are three people in whose regard <i>seiva </i>is stated: Abraham, and it was beneficial for him; David,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">I Chronicles 29:28.</i> and it was beneficial for him; Gideon,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Judges 8:32.</i> and it was not beneficial for him. Why? “Gideon crafted it into an ephod” (Judges 8:27) – for idol worship.
<b>“Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Makhpela, in the field of Efron, son of Tzohar the Hitite, that is before Mamre” (Genesis 25:9).</b> <br>“Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Makhpela” – here the maidservant’s son [Ishmael] accorded honor to the mistress’s son [Isaac, by allowing him to go first]. <br><b>“The field that Abraham purchased from the children of Ḥet; there Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife” (Genesis 25:10).</b> <br>“The field that Abraham purchased” – Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Were there not thirty-eight years between Sarah’s burial and Abraham’s burial? And yet you say here: “There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife”?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Why is Sarah’s burial mentioned at this point, being that it had happened so many years in the past?</i> The explanation is that it is to teach you that everyone who performed kindness to Sarah [in attending her funeral] was privileged to perform kindness for Abraham [in attending his funeral as well]. <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Shem and Ever were walking before his bier, and they saw an empty spot alongside her [Sarah] for our patriarch Abraham, and they buried him in that adjacent plot, in the place that was prepared and designated for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And that is why Sarah’s burial is mentioned at this point.</i>
<b>“It was after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac lived beside Be’er Laḥai Ro’i (Genesis 25:11).</b> <br>“It was after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son” – Rabbi Simon said: Everywhere that it is stated “it was after [the death],” the world regressed. “It was after the death of Abraham” – immediately, “All the cisterns…the Philistines sealed them after Abraham’s death” (Genesis 26:15, 18). “It was after the death of Moses, servant of the Lord” (Joshua 1:1) – immediately, the well, the clouds of glory, and the manna ceased. “It was after Joshua’s death” (Judges 1:1) – immediately, the pegs of the Land waged war against them.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Canaanite nations. They are called “pegs,” as in Numbers 33:55: "Those whom you leave over will be like pegs in your eyes and thorns in your side.”</i> “It was after Saul’s death” (II Samuel 1:1) – “the Philistines were waging war against Israel” (I Samuel 31:1). The students raised an objection to Rabbi Simon: ‘But is it not written: “After the death of Yehoyada, the princes of Judah came and prostrated themselves to the king”?’ (II Chronicles 24:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">There does not appear to be any regression there.</i> Rabbi Tanḥuma said: ‘Rabbi Simon came to say [his rule] only concerning [the phrase]<i> </i>“it was after [the death].”’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Whereas in this verse, the words “it was” are missing from the formula.</i> <br>Rabbi Yudan said: [The words “it was after the death” of certain people connote that] the world would have regressed had the Holy One blessed be He not established others in their stead, as it is written: “It was after Abraham’s death,” and it is written: “Isaac dug anew” (Genesis 26:18). “It was after the death of Moses, servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, saying” (Joshua 1:1). And it is written: “It was after Joshua’s death…the Lord said: Judah will ascend” (Judges 1:1–2). It is written: “It was after Saul’s death and David had returned from smiting the Amalekites, and David had stayed in Tziklag [two] days” (II Samuel 1:1),<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">David immediately took Saul’s place as military leader.</i> and it is written prior to this matter, [even] prior to Samuel’s death: “David was the son of a nobleman…” (I Samuel 17:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is the opening verse of the passage describing the beginning of David’s career as a warrior, when he slew Goliath.</i>
<b>“These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham” (Genesis 25:12).</b> <br>“These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva and the Rabbis were sitting and finding difficulty [with this passage]: ‘Why did the verse see fit to describe the lineage of the wicked man [Ishmael] here, [as well as his age at death]?’ [Just then] Rabbi Levi passed by. They said: ‘Here comes the master of <i>halakha</i>, let us ask him.’ Rabbi Levi said: ‘It is in order to tell you at what age your ancestor [Jacob] was blessed.’<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">From knowing the age of Ishmael when he died (see the next verse), it can be derived that Jacob was sixty-three years old when he received his father’s blessing. See <i>Megilla </i>17a.</i> <br><b>“These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years, and he expired and died and he was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:17).</b> <br>“These are the years of the life of Ishmael” – why did the verse see fit to recount the years of the wicked one here? It is because he came from the far reaches of the desert to perform kindness for his father [in attending his funeral]. <br><b>“They dwelled from Ḥavila to Shur, that is adjacent to Egypt, all the way to Assyria: he settled among all his brethren” (Genesis 25:18).</b> <br>“They dwelled from Ḥavila…” – here it says: “he settled [among all his brethren]” [<i>nafal</i>, literally, fell down], but elsewhere it says [of Ishmael]: “He will dwell [<i>yishkon</i>] [among all his brethren]” (Genesis 16:12). The explanation is that all the days our patriarch Abraham was alive – <i>yishkon</i>. When our patriarch Abraham died – <i>nafal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">He fell in stature.</i> Before he extended his hand against the Temple – <i>yishkon</i>; once he extended his hand against it<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalms 83:3–19.</i> – <i>nafal</i>. In this world – <i>yishkon</i>; but in the future – <i>nafal</i>.

Chapter 63

<b>“This is the legacy of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham begot Isaac” (Genesis 25:19).</b> <br>“This is the legacy of Isaac, Abraham’s son.” “The father of the righteous will exult with happiness [<i>gil yagil</i>], and the begetter of the wise will rejoice in him” (Proverbs 23:24) – happiness [<i>gila</i>] after happiness when the righteous one is born. “It was in the days of Aḥaz…” (Isaiah 7:1) – Rabbi Hoshaya said: The ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, woe that Aḥaz reigned.’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ahaz was a wicked king. See II Kings 16:1–4.</i> He said to them: ‘He is Yotam’s son. His father was righteous, and I cannot extend my hand against him.’ “And the begetter of the wise will rejoice in him” – Rabbi Levi said: From where do you say that anyone who has a son who diligently engages in Torah, that he becomes filled with mercy upon him? The verse states: “My son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will rejoice” (Proverbs 23:15). Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: I have derived only the heart of his flesh and blood father, from where is it derived that even the Holy One blessed be He becomes filled with mercy upon him when he diligently engages in Torah? The verse states: “My heart too<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is explaining that the verse says "too" as a reference to God, who rejoices with him.</i> will rejoice.” Happiness after happiness – when he is a righteous one, son of a righteous one; “this is the legacy of Isaac, Abraham’s son.”
“The crown of elders is grandchildren” (Proverbs 17:6). The fathers are the crown of their children, and the children are the crown of their fathers. The fathers are the crown of their children, as it is stated: “And the glory of children is their fathers” (Proverbs 17:6). And the children are the crown of their fathers, as it is written: “The crown of elders is grandchildren.” Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: Abraham was rescued from the fiery furnace due only to the merit of Jacob. This is analogous to one who had a judgment before the governor, and his sentence, issued by the governor, was that he was to be burned. That governor foresaw through astrology that he [the defendant] was destined to beget a daughter and she would marry the king. He said: ‘He is worthy to be spared due to the merit of his daughter that he is destined to beget, and she will marry the king.’ So, Abraham, his sentence issued by Nimrod was that he was to be burned. The Holy One blessed be He foresaw that Jacob was destined to emerge from him. He said: ‘Abraham is worthy of being spared due to the merit of Jacob.’ That is what is written: “Therefore, so says the Lord to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham…” (Isaiah 29:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The order of the Hebrew words allows for "who" to be interpreted as referring to Jacob.</i> Alternatively, “the crown of elders is grandchildren” – “this is the legacy of Isaac, Abraham’s son.”
Abram was called Abraham. Isaac was called Abraham, as it is stated: “This is the legacy of Isaac, Abraham’s son; Abraham.” Jacob was called Israel, as it is written: “He said: No longer will Jacob be said to be your name, but rather, Israel” (Genesis 32:29). Isaac was called Israel, as it is written: “These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob [<i>et Yaakov</i>]” (Exodus 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse as saying that Jacob is included in “the children of Israel.” If so, Israel in this verse is Isaac.</i> Abraham was called Israel. Rabbi Natan said: It is a profound matter. “The dwelling of the children of Israel that they dwelled in Egypt” (Exodus 12:40), in the land of Canaan, and in the land of Goshen “was four hundred and thirty years” (Exodus 12:40).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The total starts from the Covenant of the Pieces, which God made with Abraham before Isaac was born, and the Torah refers to it as: “The dwelling of the children of Israel.”</i>
<b>“Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca, daughter of Betuel the Aramean, from Padan Aram, sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife” (Genesis 25:20).</b> <br>“Isaac was forty years old [when he took Rebecca, daughter of Betuel the Aramean, from Padan Aram, sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife]” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: If it is to teach that she is from Aram Naharayim, and is it not already stated: “From Padan Aram,” why does the verse state “Aramean” – “daughter of Betuel the Aramean [<i>haarami</i>]”?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Somebody who lived in Padan Aram was called an Aramean.</i> Why does the verse state “sister of Laban the Aramean”? Rather, it is coming to teach you: Her father was a charlatan [<i>ramai</i>], her brother was a charlatan, and the residents of her place were likewise so, but this righteous woman who emerged from their midst, to what is she comparable? It is to a “lily among the thorns” (Song of Songs 2:2). “He went to Padan Aram” (Genesis 28:5). Why does the verse state: “To Laban the Aramean”? (Genesis 28:5).It teaches that he included them all in deceit.
<b>“Isaac entreated the Lord opposite his wife, because she was barren, and the Lord acceded to his entreaty, and Rebecca his wife conceived” (Genesis 25:21).</b> <br>“Isaac entreated [<i>vayetar</i>] the Lord opposite his wife” – Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because he poured out prayers abundantly [<i>beosher</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In Aramaic, the root <i>ayin tav reish</i> is parallel to the Hebrew <i>ayin shin reish</i>. </i> Reish Lakish said: Because he overturned the decree. On that basis they call a pitchfork <i>atra</i>, as it overturns the grain. <br>“Opposite his wife” – it teaches that Isaac was prostrated here and she was prostrated there, and he was saying: Master of the universe, all the children that You are giving me will be from this righteous woman.’ She, too, said so: ‘All the children that You are destined to give me will be from this righteous man.’ <br>“Because she was barren” – Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Lakish: She did not have a uterus, and the Holy One blessed be He fashioned a uterus for her. <br>“The Lord acceded [<i>vayeater</i>] to his entreaty” – Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to the son of kings, who was tunneling under his father in order to take a <i>litra </i>of gold. This one was tunneling from inside,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The king sought to enable his son to gain access to the gold.</i> and that one was tunneling from outside, as in Arabia they call tunneling <i>atirata</i>.
<b>“The children were agitated within her, and she said: If this is so, why do I exist? She went to inquire of the Lord” (Genesis 25:22).</b> <br>“The children were agitated [<i>vayitrotzetzu</i>] within her” – Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This one ran [<i>ratz</i>] to kill that one and that one ran to kill this one. Reish Lakish said: This one permitted the command of [<i>matir tzivuyo</i>] that one, and that one permitted the command of this one.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Each of them permitted himself to do what the other deemed prohibited.</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Levi: So that you will not say that it was after he [Esau] emerged from his mother’s womb that he confronted him, but rather, while he was still in his mother’s womb, his fist [<i>zirte</i>] was outstretched toward him. That is what is written: “The wicked are corrupt [<i>zoru</i>] from the womb” (Psalms 58:4). <br>“The children were agitated within her” – when she would stand adjacent to synagogues and study halls, Jacob would convulse to emerge. That is what is written: “Before I formed you in the belly I knew you” (Jeremiah 1:5). When she would pass houses of idol worship, Esau would run and convulse to emerge. That is what is written: “The wicked are corrupt from the womb.” <br><b>“The Lord said to her: Two peoples are in your womb, and two nations will be separated from your innards; one nation will prevail over the other nation, and the elder will serve the younger” (Genesis 25:23). <br>“Her days to give birth were complete, and behold, there were twins in her womb” (Genesis 25:24).  <br>“The first emerged ruddy, all of him like a cloak of hair, and they called his name Esau” (Genesis 25:25). <br>“Then his brother emerged, his hand grasping Esau’s heel, and he called his name Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them” (Genesis 25:26).</b> <br>“She said: If this is so, why do I exist [<i>lama zeh anokhi</i>]?” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It teaches that our matriarch Rebecca was circulating around the entrances of women’s houses and saying to them: ‘In your days, did you experience this suffering? If this is the suffering that comes with children; had I only not conceived.’ Rav Huna said: [She said:] ‘If this is how I am destined to produce twelve tribes, would I only not conceive the numerical value of <i>zeh</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See the end of the paragraph.</i> It is taught in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: Rebecca was worthy to have twelve tribes emerge from her. That is what is written: “The Lord said to her: Two peoples are in your womb” – these are two; “and two nations” – that is four; “and one nation will prevail over the other nation” – that is six; “and the elder will serve the younger” – that is eight. “Her days to give birth were complete” – that is ten. “The first emerged ruddy” – that is eleven; “then his brother emerged” – that is twelve. There are some who derive it from this verse: “She said: If this is so, why do I exist [<i>lama zeh anokhi</i>]?” <i>Zayin</i> – seven, <i>heh</i> – 5, that is twelve, the numerical value of <i>zeh</i>.  <br>“She went to inquire of the Lord” (Genesis 25:22) – were there synagogues and study halls in those days?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Had there been, she could have gone to pray there to God; where, then, did she go? She could have prayed at home.</i> Did she not go only to the academy of Shem and Ever? It is, rather, to teach you that anyone who enters before a Torah scholar, it is as though he enters before the Divine Presence.
“The Lord said to her” (Genesis 25:23) – Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Rabbi Shimon:: The Holy One blessed be He never deigned to speak with a woman except for that righteous woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Sarah, see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 48:20.</i> and that, too, was for a reason. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: How much did He go in a roundabout manner in order to speak with her: “No, but you did laugh” (Genesis 18:15). But is it not written: “She<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hagar.</i> called the name of the Lord who spoke to her”? (Genesis 16:13). Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Abba Ḥama bar Ḥanina: It was by means of an angel. Rabbi Elazar said: By means of Shem son of Noah. <br>“Two peoples [<i>goyim</i>] are in your womb” (Genesis 25:23) – two of the proudest of peoples are in your womb. This one is proud of his world<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">His world that exists for the sake of Torah and leads to the World to Come.</i> and that one is proud of his empire. Two of the proudest of peoples are in your womb – Hadrian among the idolaters and Solomon in Israel. <br>Another matter, two of those hated by the peoples are in your womb.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The word “two” is extraneous, as unless otherwise indicated, the plural “peoples” connotes two. The word “two [<i>shenei</i>]” is expounded as <i>sonei</i> or <i>senuei</i> – those hated by peoples.</i> All the idolaters hate Esau, and all the idolaters hate Israel. [Alternately] the most hated of the sons is in your womb, as it is written: “But I hated Esau” (Malachi 1:3). <br>“And two nations will be separated from your innards” (Genesis 25:23) – from here it is derived that he was born circumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">They were already different while they were in the womb. Jacob was circumcised and Esau was not.</i> <br>“One nation will prevail over the other nation” (Genesis 25:23) – Rabbi Ḥelbo said: To this point, they would be called: “Savta, Raama, and Savtekha” (Genesis 10:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Small nations and families were counted.</i> From you, Jews and Romans would arise.  <br>“The elder will serve the younger” (Genesis 25:23) – Rabbi Huna said: If he [Jacob] merits, he [Esau] will serve, but if not, he [Esau] will be served.
“Her days to give birth were complete” (Genesis 25:24) – elsewhere<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">When Tamar gave birth (Genesis 38:27).</i> they<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The days of pregnancy.</i> are incomplete, and here they are complete. Elsewhere it is written: “Twins [<i>teomim</i>]” (Genesis 38:27) – Peretz and Zeraḥ were both righteous, but here, “<i>tomim</i>” – Jacob was righteous, Esau, wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The regular spelling is <i>teomim</i>. The midrash explains that a letter missingfrom the word indicates that something is amiss.</i> <br>“The first emerged ruddy” (Genesis 25:25) – Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Due to the merit of: “You shall take for you on the first day” (Leviticus 23:40),<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The mitzva of the four species.</i> I reveal myself to you first, as it is stated: “I am first and I am last” (Isaiah 44:6); I will exact retribution on your behalf from the first – that is Esau, as it is written: “The first emerged”; I will build for you the first – this is the Temple, in whose regard it is written: “Throne of glory, exalted from the first, [is the place of our Temple]” (Jeremiah 17:12); and I will bring you the first, this is the messianic king, in whose regard it is written: “The first to Zion, behold, here it is” (Isaiah 41:27). <br>Another matter, “the first emerged ruddy” – why did Esau emerge first? It was so he would emerge and his corruption would depart with him. Rabbi Abahu said: It is like that bathhouse attendant who washes the bathhouse and then bathes the king’s son. So, why did Esau emerge first? It was so he would emerge and his corruption would depart with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The womb would remain clean for Jacob.</i> <br>A noblewoman asked Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta, she said to him: ‘Why did Esau emerge first?’ He said to her: ‘The first droplet<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Of semen.</i> was Jacob’s.’ He said to her: ‘This is analogous to an instance where you place two pearls into one tube, is it not the one that you placed first that will emerge last? So, the first droplet was Jacob’s.’ <br>“Ruddy,” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: As though he were a shedder of blood. When Samuel saw that David was ruddy, as it is written: “He sent and brought him and he was ruddy” (I Samuel 16:12), he was afraid and said: ‘This is a shedder of blood like Esau.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “With beautiful eyes” (I Samuel 16:12). Esau killed at his own initiative, but this one kills at the initiative of Sanhedrin. <br>The emperor Diocletian was a swineherd near Tiberias. When he would come to the study hall of Rabbi,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda Nesia, grandson of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> the children would go out and strike him. Sometime later, he became emperor, and he descended and resided near the Panyas; variant reading: Pamyas, and he sent directives to Tiberias just before nightfall on Thursday: ‘I decree that the prominent leaders of the Jews shall appear before me before morning on Sunday.’ He commanded the emissary and said to him: ‘Do not deliver them [the directives] to them until sunset on Friday.’ Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman went down to bathe. He saw Rabbi standing before the great study hall, and he saw that his face was sickly. He said to him: ‘Why is your face sickly?’ ‘Such and such directives were sent to me by the empire.’ He said to him: ‘Come and bathe, as your Creator performs miracles on our behalf.’ They entered to bathe, and the demon Arginiton came, and was laughing and dancing before them. Rabbi wanted to scold him. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said to him: ‘Leave him alone, as sometimes he appears for the purpose of miracles.’ He said to him: ‘Your master is in distress and you are standing, laughing, and dancing.’ He [the demon] said to them: ‘Go eat and drink and observe a fine Shabbat, as your Master will perform miracles on your behalf, and I will have you stand before him on Sunday morning.’ At the conclusion of Shabbat, after the service, he took them and stood them outside the gates of Panyas.  <br>They [servants] entered and said to him [Diocletian]: ‘They are standing before the gates.’ He said: ‘Close the gates.’ He [the demon] took them [the Rabbis] and placed them on the city wall. They [servants] entered and told him [Diocletian]. He said: ‘I decree that they should heat the bathhouse for three days, and then they will enter, bathe, and come before me.’ They went and heated the bathhouse for three days, and one of the Arginiton demons entered and diluted it<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">With cold water.</i> for them. They entered, bathed, and came before him. He said to them: ‘Because you know that your God performs miracles on your behalf, you belittle the emperor.’ They said to him: ‘We belittle Diocletian the swineherd, but we are subjugated to Diocletian the emperor.’ He said to them: ‘Even so, do not demean a young Roman, and not a low ranking soldier.’ “All of him like a cloak of [<i>kaaderet</i>] hair” (Genesis 25:25) – all of him is worthy of the cloak. <br>The Rabbis of the South in the name of Rabbi Alexandri, and Raḥava in the name of Rabbi Kahana said: He came out all unkempt and scattered like an <i>aderet</i> – like the chaff and the straw from the threshing floor [<i>idera</i>]. That is what is written: “Then the iron…were pulverized, and became like the chaff from the threshing floors [<i>idrei</i>] of summer” (Daniel 2:35). Rabbi Hanina bar Yithak said: What caused them to be pulverized? “From the threshing floors [<i>me’idera</i>] of the summer” (Daniel 2:35) – it is because they extended their hands against the great [<i>adirim</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Israel.</i> <br>“They called his name Esau [Esav]” (Genesis 25:25) – this is the falsehood [<i>heh shav</i>] that I created in My world. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: You called your swine a name, I, too, call My firstborn son a name: “So said the Lord: My son, My firstborn, is Israel” (Exodus 4:22).
“Then his brother emerged” (Genesis 25:26) – a certain officer asked one of the Sages in Beit Seloni. He said to him: ‘Who will assume the kingdom after us?’ He took a blank paper, took a quill, and wrote on it: “Then his brother emerged, his hand grasping…heel” (Genesis 25:26). They said: ‘See ancient matters from the mouth of a modern Sage, to inform you how much pain that righteous one suffered.’
<b>“The lads grew; Esau was a man who knows hunting, a man of the field; Jacob was a simple man, a dweller in tents” (Genesis 25:27).</b> <br>“The lads grew” – Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a myrtle and a thorn bush that grew adjacent to one another. When they grew and blossomed, this one produced its fragrance and that one produced its thorns. So, all thirteen years, both of them would go to school and both of them would come from school. After thirteen years, this one would go to study halls, and that one would go to houses of idol worship. Rabbi Elazar said: A person must be responsible for his son until age thirteen. From there on, he must say: ‘Blessed that He has absolved me from the punishment of this one.’ <br>“Esau was a man who knows hunting [<i>tzayid</i>]” – he would ensnare [<i>tzad</i>] people with his mouth.

<b>“Jacob cooked a stew, and Esau came from the field and he was weary” (Genesis 25:29).</b> <br>“Jacob cooked a stew” – he [Esau] said to him: ‘What is the nature of this stew?’ He said to him: ‘It is because that elder<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham.</i> died.’ He said: ‘Did the attribute of justice strike that elder?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘If so, there is no granting of reward and no revival of the dead.’<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Esau was claiming that if the righteous Abraham died at a young age relative to Adam and Noah, that proved that there was no reward for righteousness.

“Esau came from the field” – Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Aivu, Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Levi, and the Rabbis in the name of Rabbi Simon: You find that Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years, and Isaac one hundred and eighty. Those five years that the Holy One blessed be He withheld from his life, it is because Esau violated two transgressions: He consorted with a betrothed young woman, as it is stated: “For he found her in the field”<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This verse refers to a betrothed woman who was raped.</i> (Deuteronomy 22:27); “and he was weary” – he killed a person, just as it says: “For my soul is wearied by the killers” (Jeremiah 4:31). Rabbi said: He stole as well, just as it says: “If thieves came for you, if plunderers of the night…” (Obadiah 1:5). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘This is what I promised to Abraham, and said to him: “You shall go to your fathers in peace; [you shall be buried at a good old age]” (Genesis 15:15) – is this “a good old age,” that he sees his grandson engaging in idol worship, engaging in forbidden sexual relations, and shedding blood? It is preferable that he leave the world [without seeing it].’ That is what is written: “For Your kindness is better than life” (Psalms 63:4). <br><b>“Esau said to Jacob: Feed me now from that red, red [<i>haadom</i></b><i> <b>haadom</i>] dish, as I am weary.

His mighty ones are red –“his warriors’ shields are reddened” (Nahum 2:4). His garments are red – “his soldiers are colored scarlet” (Nahum 2:4). One who is red exacts retribution against him – “my beloved is clear and ruddy” (Song of Songs 5:10). In red attire – “why is there red in Your attire?” (Isaiah 63:2).
<b>“Jacob said: Sell me your birthright this day” (Genesis 25:31).</b> <br>“Jacob said: Sell me…this day” – he said to him: ‘Sell me one day<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The one day is the length of God’s day, based on an interpretation of the verse: “One thousand years in Your eyes are like yesterday [<i>keyom etmol</i>]” (Psalms 90:4).</i> of yours.’ Rabbi Aḥa said: Anyone who knows how to calculate the days of the exile will find that Jacob sat one day in tranquility in the shadow of Esau. <br><b>“Esau said: Behold, I am going to die, and why do I need [<i>lama zeh li</i>] a birthright?” (Genesis 25:32).</b> <br>“Esau said: Behold, I am going to die” – Reish Lakish said: He began cursing and blaspheming. “<i>Lama li</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">That would have been enough to convey his rhetorical question: “Why do I need a birthright?”</i> is not written here, but rather, “<i>lama zeh li</i>.” It teaches that he denied: “This is [<i>zeh</i>] my God” (Exodus 15:2). <br>Another matter, “behold, I am going to die” – as Nimrod was seeking to kill him because of that garment that had belonged to Adam the first man. When he would don it and go out to the field, all the beasts and the birds in the world would come and gather near him. <br><b>“Jacob said: Take an oath to me this day, and he took an oath to him, and he sold his birthright to Jacob” (Genesis 25:23).</b> <br>“[Jacob] said: Take an oath to me” – what did Jacob our patriarch see that led him to dedicate himself to acquiring the birthright? It is as we learned: until the Tabernacle was established, private altars were permitted, and service was performed by the firstborn. From the time that the Tabernacle was established, private altars were prohibited, and service was performed by the priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zevaḥim</i> 112b.</i> He said: ‘Will this evil one stand and sacrifice?’ That is why he dedicated himself to acquiring the birthright. That is what is written: “For I will render you blood, and blood will pursue you; surely, you hated blood, and blood will pursue you” (Ezekiel 35:6). Did Esau hate blood? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is the blood of birthright and offerings. Rabbi Levi said: This is the blood of circumcision. The Rabbis said: You hated a person’s blood in his body. That is what is written: “He loved curses, and they will now come upon him. [He had no desire for blessing, and it will now be far from him]” (Psalms 109:17). Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama: “He had no desire for blessing” – and no desire for birthright. Rabbi Huna said: This is the blood of the offerings, as it is called blessing, just as it says: “You shall craft for Me an altar of earth…[in every place where I mention my name, I will come to you and I will bless you]” (Exodus 20:21).
<b>“Jacob gave Esau bread and a stew of lentils; he ate, he drank, he arose, and he went, and Esau scorned the birthright” (Genesis 25:34).</b> <br>“Jacob gave Esau bread and a stew of lentils” – just as this lentil is shaped like a circle, so, the world is cyclical. Just as this lentil has no opening, so, it is prohibited for a mourner to speak. Just as this lentil has aspects of mourning and rejoicing, so, mourning because our patriarch Abraham died; rejoicing, because Jacob took the birthright. <br>“He ate, he drank” – he brought a group of immoral people in with him. They said: ‘We will eat his food and mock him.’ But the Divine Spirit was saying: “Set the table” (Isaiah 21:5) – prepare the table; “set the lookout to watch [<i>tzafo hatzafit</i>]” (Isaiah 21:5) – prepare the candelabrum. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: There is a place where they call the candelabrum <i>tzafita</i>.  “Arise princes” (Isaiah 21:5) – this is Mikhael and Gavriel. “Anoint a shield” (Isaiah 21:5) – write that the birthright is to Jacob. Bar Kappara said: Because they were mocking Jacob, the Holy One blessed be He agreed, and mocked them, and authorized the birthright to Jacob. From where is it derived? It is as it is written: “So said the Lord: My firstborn son is Israel” (Exodus 4:22). <br>“He arose, and he went” – Rabbi Levi said: He departed from his world.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">He lost his share in the World to Come.</i> <br>“Esau scorned the birthright [<i>et habekhora</i>]” – what did he scorn with it?<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>et </i>is expounded as an amplification, indicating that he scorned something else as well.</i> Rabbi Levi said: He scorned the revival of the dead with it. That is what is written: “With the coming of the wicked, comes also scorn” (Proverbs 18:3). “With the coming of the wicked” – this is Esau, as it is stated: “They will be called the region of the wicked” (Malachi 1:4). “Comes also scorn [<i>buz</i>]” – as his disgrace [<i>bizyono</i>] comes with him. “And with shame [<i>kalon</i>], humiliation [<i>ḥerpa</i>]” (Proverbs 18:3) – as the shame of famine accompanies him. <i>Ḥerpa</i> is nothing other than famine, just as it says: “So that you will no longer be subject to the humiliation of [<i>ḥerpat</i>] famine among the nations” (Ezekiel 36:30).

Chapter 64

<b>“There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was during the days of Abraham, and Isaac went to Avimelekh king of the Philistines, to Gerar” (Genesis 26:1).</b> <br>“There was a famine in the land.” “The Lord knows the days of the faultless” (Psalms 37:18) – this is Isaac. “Their inheritance will last forever” (Psalms 37:18), “Reside in this land [and I will be with you, and I will bless you]” (Genesis 26:3), “They are not put to shame in difficult times” (Psalms 37:19) – the difficulty of Avimelekh. “And in days of famine they are sated” (Psalms 37:19) – “There was a famine in the land.”
“The Lord will not starve the soul of the righteous” (Proverbs 10:3) – this is Isaac. “Reside in this land.” “And He averts the devastation of the wicked” (Proverbs 10:3) – this is Avimelekh. <br>“There was a famine” – Ten famines came to the world. One during the days of Adam the first man – “accursed is the ground because of you” (Genesis 3:17); one during the days of Lemekh – “from the ground that the Lord had cursed” (Genesis 5:29); one during the days of Abraham – “there was famine in the land and Abram descended to Egypt” (Genesis 12:10); one during the days of Isaac: “there was a famine in the land”; one during the days of Jacob – “for these two years there has been famine” (Genesis 45:6); one during the days when the judges judged – “It was in the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1); one during the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “As the Lord God of Israel [lives…there will not be dew or rain these years, except by my word]” (I Kings 17:1); one during the days of David – “there was a famine during the days of David” (II Samuel 21:1); one during the days of Elisha – “there was a great famine in Samaria” (II Kings 6:25); and one that is progressing and coming to the world and one in the future, as it is stated: “I will send famine in the land, not famine for bread, not thirst for water…” (Amos 8:11). <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The primary brunt of them was during the days of David, but it would have been appropriate for them to have been during the days of Saul, but because Saul was an offshoot of a sycamore tree<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The sycamore tree is frail.</i> the Holy One blessed be He transferred it and brought it during the days of David.

The famine that was during the days that the judges judged – Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Forty-one <i>se’a </i>were sold for the price of forty-two <i>se’a</i>. But was it not taught: A person may not leave the Land of Israel unless two <i>se’a </i>of wheat go for one <i>sela</i>. Rabbi Shimon said: When? It is at a time that one cannot find any to acquire, but if he can find any to acquire, even if it is one <i>se’a </i>for a <i>sela</i>, he may not leave the Land of Israel. Because Elimelekh left the Land of Israel, he was punished that he and his sons died.

A harsh prophecy, from where is it derived? It is as Israel would say to the prophet: “The days will lengthen, and every vision will be void” (Ezekiel 12:22).

Job cursed the day of his birth and the evening of his conception. That is what is written: “Perish the day I was born, and the night it was said: [A man has been conceived [<i>hora gaver</i>]]” (Job 3:3).

Is it possible that Ḥilkiyahu,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The father of Jeremiah.

It is, rather, because Jezebel was killing prophets, he came and engaged in conjugal relations during the day, and fled.

Chapter 65

<b>“Esau was forty years old, and he took as a wife Yehudit, daughter of Be'eri the Hitite, and Basmat, daughter of Elon the Hitite” (Genesis 26:34).</b> <br>“Esau was forty years old” – that is what is written: “The swine from the forest gnaws at it” (Psalms 80:14). Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Simon: Of all the prophets, only two of them publicized it<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The qualities of the evil empire of Rome.</i> – Moses and Asaf. Moses said: “The pig because it has a split hoof” (Deuteronomy 14:8). Asaf said: “The swine from the forest gnaws at it.” Why does he analogize it to a pig? Just as this pig, when it lies, it extends its hooves, saying: ‘I am pure,’ so, this evil empire robs and takes forcibly, [yet] it appears as though it is arranging the courtroom. So, Esau, all forty years, would ensnare married women and violate them. When he reached forty years of age, he likened himself to his father. He said: ‘Just as Father took a wife at forty years of age, I, too, will take a wife at forty years of age.’ That is what is written: “Esau was forty years old.”
“He took as a wife Yehudit” – Rabbi Yudan began: “God settles the lonely in a home…” (Psalms 68:7). This is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, as Rabbi Yehuda said: ‘Even if there is a <i>mamzer </i>at the end of the world and a <i>mamzeret </i>at the end of the world, the Holy One blessed be He brings them and matches them with one another.’ What is its source? “God settles the lonely in a home.” So, because it is written: “Rather, you shall destroy them: The Hittite, the Emorite” (Deuteronomy 20:17) – let this one, may his name be blotted out, come and marry that one, may her name be blotted out. “Esau was forty years old, and he took…”

They said to him: ‘Is it permitted to eat it?’ He said to them: ‘Go and place it on the roof; any bird that comes and alights next to it, it is of that species.’ They went and placed it on the roof and an Egyptian raven alighted next to it. He said: ‘It is impure, as it is of that species. That is what is written: “Every raven after its kind.”’ They said:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, this is a known phrase.</i> ‘The raven went to the starling only because it is of the same species.’ So, because it is written: “Rather, you shall destroy them” (Deuteronomy 20:17) – let this one, may his name be blotted out, come and marry that one, may her name be blotted out. “Esau was forty years old.”
<b>“They were a source of bitterness for Isaac and for Rebecca” (Genesis 26:35).</b> <br>“They were a source of bitterness” – why for Isaac first? Because Rebecca was the daughter of idolaters, she was not particular about the filth of idol worship. But this one, because he was the son of the holy, he was particular about the filth of idol worship. That is why it was for Isaac first. <br>Another matter, why for Isaac first? It is because the matter was attributable to her, as it is stated: “The Lord said to her: Two peoples are in your womb” (Genesis 25:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It was because of her lineage that one of the twins was wicked.</i> That is why it was for Isaac first. <br>Another matter, why for Isaac first?

But this one, because his eyes dimmed, and he was sitting inside the house, that is why it was for Isaac first.  <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: He [Esau] caused the Divine Spirit to depart from his parent.
<b>“It was when Isaac was old, and his eyes dimmed from seeing, he summoned Esau his elder son, and said to him: My son, and he said to him: Here I am” (Genesis 27:1).</b> <br>“It was when Isaac was old” – Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “Those who exonerate the wicked due to [<i>ekev</i>] a bribe” (Isaiah 5:23) – anyone who takes a bribe and exonerates the wicked – ultimately.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He will ultimately be punished.</i> “And remove the innocence of the righteous from him” (Isaiah 5:23) – “the innocence of the righteous” – this is Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The<i> Matnot Kehuna</i> explains that Moses did not justify an evil person.

“One who exonerates the wicked and one who condemns the righteous, both of them are an abomination to the Lord” (Proverbs 17:15) – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It was not because Rebecca loved Jacob more than Esau that she performed this action, but she said: ‘Let him [Esau] not enter and mislead that elder [Isaac],’ based on: “Both of them are an abomination to the Lord.” Because he exonerated the wicked, his eyes dimmed – “it was when Isaac was old, and his eyes dimmed.”
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “You shall not take a bribe [for bribes blind the clear-sighted…]” (Exodus 23:8) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: If one who took a bribe from one who owed him,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Esau owed Isaac due to the mitzva of honoring one’s father.</i> his eyes dimmed, one who takes a bribe from one who does not owe him, all the more so – “it was when Isaac was old.”
Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa began: “Much, Lord my God, You have done; Your wonders…” (Psalms 40:6) – Rabbi Ḥanina said: All the actions and thoughts that you performed on our behalf, were for our benefit. Why did Isaac’s eyes dim? It was so Jacob could come and take the blessings – “it was when Isaac was old.”
Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Abraham demanded aging. He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, a man and his son enter a place and no one knows which of them to honor. Because you adorn him with aging, a person knows whom to honor.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, you have demanded a good thing, and it will begin with you.’ From the beginning of the book until that point, aging is not written. When Abraham stood, He granted him aging – “Abraham was old” (Genesis 24:1).  <br>Isaac demanded suffering. He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, a person dies without suffering, the attribute of justice is outstretched against him. When you bring suffering upon him, the attribute of justice is not outstretched against him.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, you have demanded a good thing, and I will begin with you.’ From the beginning of the book until here, suffering is not written. When Isaac stood, He granted him suffering – “it was when Isaac was old, and [his eyes] dimmed.” <br>Jacob demanded illness. He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, a person dies without illness and does not settle matters between his children. When he is ill for two or three days, he settles matters between his children.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, you have demanded a good thing, and it will begin with you’ – “One said to Joseph: Behold, your father is ill” (Genesis 48:1). <br>Rabbi Levi said: Abraham introduced aging, Isaac introduced suffering, Jacob introduced illness, Hezekiah introduced illness that is cured. He said to Him: ‘You would sustain one until the day of his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In good health.</i> But because a person is ill and recovers, is ill and recovers, he repents.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, you have demanded a good thing.’ That is what is written: “A composition of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he became ill and recovered from his illness” (Isaiah 38:9). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: From here [we learn], that between illness and illness, there was an illness that was more severe than both of them.
“His eyes dimmed from seeing” – Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: From seeing evil– from seeing the evil of the wicked one. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Isaac will walk out to the marketplace and the people will say: This is the father of that wicked one. Instead, I will dim his eyes and he will remain inside his house.’ That is what is written: “With the rise of the wicked, a person should hide” (Proverbs 28:28). From here they said: Anyone who produces a wicked son or a wicked student, ultimately his eyes will dim. A wicked student, from Aḥiya the Shilonite – “Aḥiyahu was unable to see, for his eyes had dimmed due to his old age” (I Kings 14:4); he had produced Yerovam, a wicked student. A wicked son, from Isaac – “it was when Isaac was old, and his eyes dimmed.” <br>Another matter. “from seeing [<i>mereot</i>]” – as a result of that sight [<i>re’iya</i>]; when Abraham our patriarch bound his son atop the altar, the ministering angels wept. That is what is written: “Behold, their angels cry out outside…” (Isaiah 33:7). Tears fell from their eyes into his eyes, and they had an effect inside his eyes. When he grew old, his eyes dimmed. That is what is written: “It was when Isaac was old…” <br>Another matter. “from seeing [<i>mereot</i>]” – as a result of that sight [<i>re’iya</i>]; when Abraham our patriarch bound his son atop the altar, he [Isaac] directed his eyes heavenward and looked at the Divine Presence.

It is comparable to a king who was strolling at the entrance of his palace and glanced and saw his friend’s son peering at him through the window.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It was forbidden to look at the king.</i> He said: ‘If I kill him, I will now cause my friend to collapse.

The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I kill him, I will now cause Abraham my friend to collapse. Instead, I decree that his eyes will dim.’ When he grew old, his eyes dimmed – “it was when Isaac was old…”
“He summoned Esau his elder son” – Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon said: This is analogous to a province that made a list of mighty people for the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To serve in his army.</i> There was a certain woman there who gave birth to a puny son, and she would call her son: Tall and Quick. She said to them: 'My son is tall and quick, but you do not conscript him?' They said: 'If, in your eyes, he is tall and quick, in our eyes he is puniest of the puny.' So, his father called him great [<i>gadol</i>], as it is stated: “He called Esau, his elder [<i>hagadol</i>] son” (Genesis 27:1). His mother called him great [<i>gadol</i>], as it is stated: “The garments of Esau, her elder [<i>hagadol</i>] son” (Genesis 27:15). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘If, in your eyes, he is great, in My eyes, he is insignificant,’ as it is stated: “Behold, I rendered you insignificant among the nations, you are greatly despised” (Obadiah 1:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The prophecy was given with respect to Edom, the nation descended from Esau.</i> Rabbi Berekhya said: The slaughterer corresponds to the bull.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He is called great based on the fact that his slaughterer, the Holy One blessed be He, is great.</i> That is what is written: “There is a sacrifice for the Lord in Botzra and a great [<i>gadol</i>] slaughter in the land of Edom” (Isaiah 34:6).  <br>“And said to him: My son, and he said to him: Here I am” – that is what is written: “When he ingratiates with his voice, do not trust him…” (Proverbs 26:25). Ḥizkiyahu the translator said: “As there are seven abominations in his heart” (Proverbs 26:25). [When] you find one “abomination” written in the Torah, ten [sins] are written in its regard: “There shall not be found among you anyone who passes his son or his daughter through the fire…an enchanter, a medium, an oracle, [or a necromancer, one who casts spells, or one who consults ghosts or familiar spirits, or one who inquires of the dead; for anyone who performs these things is an abomination to the Lord]”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The list consists of nine categories, rather than ten; <i>Maharzu</i> explains that the son and the daughter passed through fire are counted separately, to make ten.</i> (Deuteronomy 18:10–12).

<b>“He said: Behold, I have now grown old; I do not know the day of my death” (Genesis 27:2).</b> <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: When a person reaches the age of his parents, five years before or five years after, he should be concerned about death, as Isaac said: ‘If I will reach the years of Father, now there are many remaining; if I will reach the years of my mother: “He said [to him]: Behold, I have now grown old; I do not know the day of my death.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac was 123 years old.

The day of death, from where is it derived? It is as it is written: “For a person, too, does not know his time” (Ecclesiastes 9:12). The day of consolation, from where is it derived? It is as it is written: “At its time, I will hasten it” (Isaiah 60:22). A person does not know the profundity of justice, as it is stated: “For judgment is God’s” (Deuteronomy 1:17). A person does not know through what he will profit, as it is written: “It is the gift of God” (Ecclesiastes 3:13). A person does not know what is in the heart of another, as it is written: “I, the Lord, probe the heart” (Jeremiah 17:10). A person does not know what the woman is carrying in her pregnancy, as it is written: “[You do not know]…how the fetuses grow in a womb of the pregnant” (Ecclesiastes 11:5).

<b>“Rebecca took the fine garments of Esau, her elder son, that were with her in the house, and she dressed Jacob her younger son” (Genesis 27:15).</b> <br>“Rebecca took the fine [<i>haḥamudot</i>] garments of Esau, her elder son” – what he had coveted [<i>sheḥamad</i>] from Nimrod, and he killed him and took them. That is what is written: “The wicked covets the prey of the evil” (Proverbs 12:12). <br>“That were with her in the house” – in them he would attend his father. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: I attended my father all my days, and I did not attend him one one-hundredth of what Esau attended his father. When I would attend my father, I attended him with dirty garments, but when I would go out on the road, I would go out with clean garments. But Esau, when he would attend his father, he would attend him only with royal garments. He said: ‘It is not in keeping with Father’s honor to attend him in anything other than royal garments.’ That is what is written: “That were with her in the house.”  <br>How many wives did he [Esau] have, and you say: “That were with her in the house”?

When they finished eating they would take the bones and cast them on the scribe. One of them was dying; they said to him: ‘To whom do you wish to entrust your son?’ He said to them: ‘To the scribe.’ But, how many friends did he have, but he said: ‘To the scribe’? It is, rather, that he knew what their actions were, and that the scribe was much better than they were. So, how many wives did he have, and the verse says: “That were with her in the house”? It is because he knew what their actions were.
<b>“And the hides of the goat kids, she placed on his arms and on the smoothness of his neck” (Genesis 27:16).</b> <br>“And the hides of the goat kids” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The two arms of our patriarch Jacob were like two pillars of marble, and you say “she placed on his arms”?

When he said: “Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me,” Isaac said: ‘I know that Esau would not mention the name of the Holy One blessed be He; this one mentions.

<b>“Jacob approached Isaac his father and he felt him, and he said: The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau” (Genesis 27:22).</b> <br>“Jacob approached Isaac…The voice is the voice of Jacob” – this voice is the voice of a wise man, but his hands are those that flay dead animals. <br>Another matter, “the voice is the voice of Jacob” – Jacob rules only with his voice. “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau” – Esau rules only with his hands. <br>Another matter, “the voice is the voice of Jacob” – Rabbi Pinḥas said: The voice of Jacob withdraws into itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">When he does not use his voice for prayer and Torah study.

But when he calls loudly with his voice, the hands are not the hands of Esau, the hands of Esau do not dominate. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: No philosophers stood in the world like Bilam son of Beor and like Avnimos the weaver. All the idolaters gathered before him.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Avnimos (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> They said to him: ‘Do you say that we can confront this nation?’ He said: ‘Go and circulate among their synagogues and study halls; if you find children there crying out,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Words of Torah.</i> you will not be able to confront them, as this is what their ancestor promised them: “The voice is the voice of Jacob” – when the voice of Jacob is found in the synagogues, the hands are not the hands of Esau, but if not, “the hands are the hands of Esau” – you can overcome them.’ <br>“The voice is the voice of Jacob” – in the case of the concubine in Giva –“cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin” (Judges 21:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Etz Yosef</i> explains that here the midrash is stating that there are instances in which the use of the voice of Jacob in an unwise manner can lead to behavior reminiscent of Esau. Because the Israelites issued a (spoken) curse forbidding the giving of any daughter in marriage to any man from the tribe of Benjamin, they had to later tell the men of Benjamin to "steal" women as wives for themselves, which is Esau-type behavior (see Judges 21:18–22).</i> <br>“The voice is the voice of Jacob” – in the days of Yerovam. The sound of weeping because they killed five hundred thousand among them, as it is written – “Yerovam did not gain strength again [in the days of Aviya; and the Lord afflicted him, and he died]” (II Chronicles 13:20). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: What do you think; that Yerovam was afflicted? But was it not Aviya who was afflicted? Why was he afflicted? Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: It is because he defaced the identifying features of Israel’s faces, as it is written: “The expression of their faces testifies against them” (Isaiah 3:9). Rabbi Levi said: Because he positioned guards over them for three days until their form decayed, as we learned: One may testify<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to giving testimony that a husband died so that his widow could remarry.</i> only about the countenance of the face with the nose, even if there are distinguishing marks on his body and his belongings…and one may testify only up to three days.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yevamot </i>120a.</i> In their regard he says: “Their widows proliferated for Me beyond the sand of the seas” (Jeremiah 15:8).

The Rabbis said: It is because an idol came into his possession and he did not nullify it,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">He did not destroy the golden calf which Yerovam had erected in Beit El.</i> as it is stated: “Aviya pursued Yerovam” (II Chronicles 13:19), and it is written: “And captured cities from him: Beit El and its environs” (II Chronicles 13:19), and it is written: “He placed one in Beit El” (I Kings 12:29). The matters can be derived <i>a fortiori</i>: If a king, because he mistreated a king like him, the verse punished him and he was defeated, a commoner who mistreats a commoner, all the more so.
Another matter, “the voice is the voice of Jacob” – his voice silences the celestial beings and the earthly beings. Rabbi Reuven said: It is written: “When they stood, their wings would slacken” (Ezekiel 1:25). “When they stood” – is there sitting on High? Did Rabbi Shmuel not say: There is no sitting on High, as it is stated: “Their legs were a straight leg” (Ezekiel 1:7). They have no joints – “I approached one of those angels [<i>kamaya</i>]” (Daniel 7:16). What is this expression <i>kamaya</i>? It is standing [<i>kayamaya</i>]. “Seraphim were standing above Him” (Isaiah 6:2). “[He said: Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on His throne,] and all the host of the heavens were standing [to His right and His left]” (II Chronicles 18:18), and you say: “When they stood”? I wonder. What is “when they stood [<i>beomdam</i>]”? When the nation comes, [there is] silence [<i>ba am dom</i>]. When Israel recites <i>Shema Yisrael</i>, the angels are silent, and then their wings would slacken. What do they recite? “Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place” (Ezekiel 3:12), and blessed is the name of the glory of His kingdom. <br>Rabbi Levi said: “When the morning stars sang together, and all the children of the great shouted” (Job 38:7) what the offspring of Jacob, who was likened to the stars, laud, as it is written in their regard: “Those who lead the multitudes to righteousness, like the stars” (Daniel 12:3). Then, “all the children of the great shouted” – these are the ministering angels. What do they recite? “Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place” (Ezekiel 3:12). <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It is written: “A wind lifted me, and I heard behind me the sound of a great noise…” (Ezekiel 3:12). “Great noise” – I wonder. Rather, after I and my counterparts lauded, then, “ I heard behind me the sound of a great noise: Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place.” What do they recite? Blessed is the name. Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai would expound: “The voice is the voice of Jacob” screaming because of what “the hands are the hands of Esau” did to him. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The voice [of Jacob, due to] the emperor Hadrian who killed eight hundred million people in Beitar.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that a very large number of people were killed.</i>
<b>“He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like the hands of his brother Esau, and he blessed him” (Genesis 27:23).</b> <br>“He did not recognize him” – when wicked people were produced from him, he [Isaac] did not recognize them. <br><b>“His father Isaac said to him: Approach and kiss me, my son” (Genesis 27:26).</b> <br>“Approach and kiss me” – he said to him: ‘You will be adjacent to me in burial, but no other will be adjacent to me in burial.’ <br><b>“He approached and kissed him, and he smelled the scent of his garments, and blessed him, and said: See, the scent of my son is as the scent of a field that the Lord blessed” (Genesis 27:27).</b> <br>“He approached and kissed him, and he smelled the scent of his garments” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is nothing whose odor is viler than this goat hide, and you say: “He smelled the scent of his garments, and blessed him”? It is, rather, that when our patriarch Jacob entered to his father, the Garden of Eden entered with him. That is what he said to him: “See, the scent of my son is as the scent of a field.” But when Esau entered to his father, Gehenna entered with him, just as it says: “With the arrival of spite, disgrace arrives” (Proverbs 11:2). <br>Another matter, “he smelled the scent of his garments [<i>begadav</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded to mean “his traitors [<i>bogedav</i>]” have a good scent – they repent.</i> and blessed him” – e.g., Yosef Meshita and Yakum of Tzerorot. Yosef Meshita, when the enemies sought to enter the Temple Mount, they said: ‘Let one of them enter, and it<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The desecration.</i> will begin with them.’ They said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">They wanted a Jew to enter the Temple Mount first, and chose Yosef Meshita, who agreed to enter.</i> ‘Enter, and whatever you take out is yours.’ He entered and took out a golden candelabrum. They said to him: ‘It is not appropriate for a commoner to make use of this.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">It should be given to the emperor.</i> Instead, enter again, and what you take out is yours.’ He refused. Rabbi Pinḥas said: They offered him taxes for three years,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">He could keep whatever taxes he would collect from the people.</i> but he refused. He said: ‘Is it not enough that I angered my God once, that I would anger Him a second time?’ What did they do to him? They placed him on a carpenter’s sawhorse and were sawing him. He was shouting and saying: ‘Woe is me that I angered my Creator.’  <br>Yakum of Tzerorot was the son of the sister of Rabbi Yosei ben Yoezer of Tzereida. He was riding a horse on Shabbat. In front of him, a cross on which Jews who observed Shabbat would be crucified was being dragged. He [Yakum of Tzerorot] said to him [Yosei ben Yoezer]: ‘Look at the horse on which my master has me riding, and look at the horse on which your Master has you riding.’<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">When the cross was too heavy to bear, very often they would drag it between their legs, so it looked like a horse.</i> He told him: ‘If so it is for those who anger Him, all the more so for those who perform His will.’ He [also] said to him: ‘If it is so for those who perform his will, all the more so for those who anger him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Yosei ben Yoezer made two responses to his nephew. First, that if he had received a reward despite angering God, certainly, those who serve God will ultimately receive a reward. Second, if those who serve God suffer so much, certainly those who anger God will ultimately suffer more.</i> It [his uncle’s words] penetrated him like the venom of a serpent. He went and fulfilled in himself the four court-imposed death penalties – stoning, burning, beheading, and strangulation. What did he do? He brought a beam and stuck it into the ground. He tied a string to it, arranged wood, and surrounded it with a stone fence.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The stone fence was supported by the wood which it surrounded.</i> He kindled a bonfire before it,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The bonfire was kindled near the fence, and when the fire reached the fence it kindled the wood which was within the fence and partially under the fence.</i> stuck a sword in the middle,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The sword was in the middle of the wood which was arranged within the fence near the beam.</i> kindled the fire under the stones, hanged himself from the beam and was strangled. The fire reached him, it severed the string, he fell into the fire, the sword reached him, the fence fell on him, and he was burned. Yosei ben Yoezer of Tzereida dozed and saw his bier floating in the air. He said: ‘That one preceded me by a small amount of time into the Garden of Eden.’
Another matter, it teaches that the Holy One blessed be He showed him the Temple built and destroyed and built. “See, the scent of my son” – that is built, just as it says: “My pleasing aroma; you shall observe” (Numbers 28:2). “Like the scent of a field” – that is destroyed, just as it says: “Zion will be plowed as a field” (Micah 3:12). “That the Lord blessed” – built and enhanced in the future, as it is stated: “For there the Lord commanded the blessing of life, for eternity” (Psalms 133:3). <br>##“And may God give you from the dew of the heavens, and from the fat of the land, and an abundance of grain and wine” (Genesis 27:28).

Chapter 66

“And may God give you from the dew of the heavens.” It is written: “My root will be open to water, and dew will lie on my branch” (Job 29:19) – Job said: ‘Because my doors were wide open, everyone would reap dry crops, and I would reap full, lush kernels.’ What is the source? “My root will be open to water.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is being interpreted as saying that the door was open and everything was available to a guest, just as water is freely available. The word root is interpreted as referring to the door since the house "begins" from the door and the tree begins from it's roots (<i>Radal</i>).</i> Jacob said: ‘Because I was engaged in Torah that is likened to water, I was privileged to be blessed with dew,’ as it is stated: “And may God give you from the dew of the heavens.”
Rabbi Berekhya began: “Return, return, the Shulamite; return, return, and we will gaze upon you” (Song of Songs 7:1) – “return” is written four times, corresponding to the four kingdoms into which Israel entered whole and emerged whole. “The Shulamite” – it is a nation that the peace [<i>shalom</i>] of the One who lives forever moves with it, from tent to tent. <br>“The Shulamite” – the nation that the priests instill peace into it every day, as it is stated: “They shall place My name” (Numbers 6:27), and it is written: “And grant you peace” (Numbers 6:26). <br>“The Shulamite” – the nation that the One who is peace of the worlds resides in its midst, as it is stated: “They shall craft for Me a Sanctuary, and I will dwell in their midst” (Exodus 25:8). <br>“The Shulamite” – the nation that I am destined to instill peace into it, as it is stated: “I will grant peace in the Land” (Leviticus 26:6). <br>“The Shulamite” – the nation toward which I will direct peace; that is what is written: “So said the Lord: Behold, I will direct peace to her like a river” (Isaiah 66:12). <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Tanḥum and Rabbi Ḥana in the name of Rabbi Idi: A nation that made peace between Me and My world, as were it not for it, I would destroy My world. Rav Huna in the name of Rav Aḥa began: “The earth and all its inhabitants melted away” (Psalms 75:4) – just as it says: “All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away” (Exodus 15:15). “I set firm” (Psalms 75:4) – I, once they accepted upon themselves, “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), “I set firm its pillars, Selah” (Psalms 75:4) – and the world was filled with joy [<i>venitbasem</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There is a variant reading: <i>Venitbases</i> – the world was firmed.</i> <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Maron says: The nation that preserves [<i>meshalema</i>] the stability of the world, both in this world, and in the World to Come. Rabbi Levi said: A nation that all the good that comes into the world comes only due to its merit. Rains fall only due to its merit, dews fall only due to its merit, as it is stated: “And may God give you from the dew of the heavens” – to you, due to your merit, and the matter is dependent upon you.
“May [God] give you [<i>veyiten lekha</i>]” – He will give, and give you again.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded from the fact that the word begins with a <i>vav</i>. </i> He will give you blessings and He will give you a hidden place.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A place where you can retain the blessings. Namely, peace, based on the statement (see Mishna <i>Okatzin</i> 3:12) that the vessel which can retain blessings is peace (<i>Maharzu</i>).</i> “May [God] give you” – yours, and “may [God] give you” – your father’s. “May [God] give you” – yours, and “may [God] give you” – your brother’s.  <br>Rabbi Aḥa said: May [God] give, “and may God give you” divine aid. When? It will be when you need it. That is what is written: “And said: My Lord God, please remember me and please strengthen me” (Judges 16:28) – he said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, remember for me that blessing that Father blessed me: May [God] give, “and may God give you” divine aid.’ <br>“From the dew of the heavens” – this is the manna, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: Behold, I am raining food for you from the heavens” (Exodus 16:4). “And from the fat of the land” – this is the well that would bring up for them types of fish that were exceedingly fat. “And from the fat of the land” – these are the offerings, as it is written: “I will offer up to You burnt offerings of fattened animals” (Psalms 66:15). “And an abundance of grain” – these are the lads, as it is written: “For how good and how beautiful it is, there will be grain for the young men” (Zechariah 9:17). “And wine” – these are the maidens, as it is written: “and new wine will make the maidens talk” (Zechariah 9:17). <br>Another matter, “from the dew of the heavens” – this is Zion, as it is stated: “Like the dew of Hermon descending upon the mountains of Zion” (Psalms 133:3). “And from the fat of the land” – these are the offerings. “Grain” – these are the first fruits. “Wine” – these are the libations. Alternatively, “from the dew of the heavens” – this is the Bible; “and from the fat of the land” – this is Mishna; “grain” – this is Talmud; “wine” – this is <i>aggada</i>.
<b>“Peoples will serve you, and nations will prostrate themselves to you. Be a lord to your brethren, and your mother’s sons will prostrate themselves to you. Cursed be one who curses you, and blessed be one who blesses you” (Genesis 27:29).</b> <br>“Peoples will serve you” – these are the seventy nations. “And nations will prostrate themselves to you” – these are the descendants of Ishmael and the sons of Ketura, in whose regard it is written: “Ashurim, Letushim, and Leumim” (Genesis 25:3). “Be a lord to your brethren” – this is Esau and his chieftains. “And your mother’s sons will prostrate themselves to you” – here it says: “And your mother’s sons will prostrate themselves to you,” but elsewhere it says: “And your father’s sons will prostrate themselves to you” (Genesis 49:8). It is that Jacob, because he took four wives, Leah, Rachel, Zilpa, and Bilha, he says: “Your father’s sons.” Isaac took Rebecca, he said: “Your mother’s sons.” <br>“Cursed be one who curses you…” – and elsewhere it says: “Those who bless you are blessed, and those who curse you are cursed” (Numbers 24:9). It is that Bilam, because he was a hater, began with a blessing and concluded with a curse. Yitzḥak, who was a lover, opened with a curse and concluded with a blessing.  <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Rabbi Ḥiyya said: The wicked, because their beginning is tranquility and their end is suffering, they begin with blessing and end with curse. The righteous, because their beginning is suffering and their end is tranquility, they begin with curse and end with blessing: “Cursed be one who curses you, and blessed be one who blesses you.”
<b>“It was when Isaac concluded to bless Jacob, and Jacob had just departed from the presence of Isaac his father, and Esau his brother came from his hunt” (Genesis 27:30).</b> <br>“It was when Isaac concluded to bless Jacob” – Rabbi Aivu said: The tent of our patriarch Isaac was open on all sides. One came from here and one came from there. The Rabbis say: It was hinged, and the doors would fold backward. Jacob stood behind the door until Esau entered, and then he went out. That is what is written: “Jacob had just departed [<i>Akh yatzo yatza</i>]” – he appeared to go out but was not going out. “And Esau his brother came from his hunt [<i>mitzeido</i>]” – he was armed to hunt for his life, just as it says: “But if one did not have intent [<i>tzada</i>]” (Exodus 21:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The verse appears in the context of murder.</i>
Another matter, “blessed be one who blesses you” – it is taught: An idol worshiper who blesses the Name, one answers amen after him; with the Name, one does not answer amen after him.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If a gentile blesses God, one should answer ‘Amen.’ If he blesses a Jew using the name of God, one should not answer ‘Amen,’ to indicate that his blessing does not help (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Tanḥuma said: If one idolater blesses you, answer amen after him, as it is written: “You shall be blessed more than all the peoples [<i>mikol haamim</i>]” (Deuteronomy 7:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Literally – “from all the nations.”</i> A certain idolater encountered Rabbi Yishmael and blessed him. He said to him: ‘The response is already stated.’ A certain idolater encountered Rabbi Yishmael and cursed him. He said to him: ‘The response is already stated.’ They said to him: ‘What you said to this one, you said to that one.’ He said to them: ‘So it is written: “Those who bless you are blessed, and those who curse you are cursed”’ (Numbers 24:9).
<b>“He, too, prepared delicacies, and brought them to his father, and said to his father: Let my father arise, and eat from his son’s game, so that your soul will bless me” (Genesis 27:31).</b> <br>“He, too, prepared delicacies, and brought them to his father, and said to his father: Let my father arise” – that is what is written: “The spider grasps with hands” (Proverbs 30:28). Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: By virtue of what merit does the spider grasp?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A metaphor for the Roman Empire, that descended from Esau.</i> It is due to the merit of those hands – “he, too, prepared delicacies.” <br>“Let my father arise” – because he said to him: “Let [my father] arise,” I will exact retribution against him with that same expression: “May God arise…His enemies scatter” (Psalms 68:2).

Chapter 67

“Isaac was overcome with great trembling, and he said: Who then is he who hunted game, and brought it me, and I ate from all before you came, and I blessed him? Indeed, he shall be blessed” (Genesis 27:33).</b> <br>“Isaac was overcome with great trembling.” It is written: “A man’s trembling sets a snare, and one who trusts the Lord will be exalted” (Proverbs 29:25) – the trembling that Ruth caused Boaz, as it is stated: “He trembled and recoiled” (Ruth 3:8), “sets a snare” – by right he should have cursed her. However, “one who trusts the Lord will be exalted” – he considered it, and blessed her: “He said: May you be blessed to the Lord, my daughter” (Ruth 3:10). The trembling that Jacob caused Isaac, as it is stated: “Isaac was overcome with great trembling,” “sets a snare” – by right he should have cursed him. However, “one who trusts the Lord will be exalted” – he blessed him and said: “Indeed, he shall be blessed.”
“Isaac was overcome with great trembling” – Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: “Great” – more than the trembling that he trembled atop the altar.  <br>He said: “Who [then], is” the one who became an intermediary between me and the Omnipresent so that Jacob would receive the blessings? He said it regarding Rebecca. <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who has two sons, one leaving and one entering,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">One receiving a blessing and one not receiving a blessing.</i> trembles? I wonder. It is, rather, that when Esau entered to his father, Gehenna entered with him. <br>Rabbi Aḥa said: The walls of the house began seething. That is what is written: “Who then [<i>mi efo</i>],” who is that who is destined to be baked here, is it me, or my son Jacob? The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘It is neither you nor your son, but rather, “he who hunted game.”’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Esau.</i> <br>“He who hunted game” – Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon said: Hunter, how did they trap you? Conqueror of gates, how are your gates conquered and ruined? That is what is written: “The deceitful will not scorch [<i>yaḥarokh</i>] his prey” (Proverbs 12:27). The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He does not delay [<i>yeaḥer</i>] and does not extend [<i>yaarikh</i>] for the deceitful one and his deceit. Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Yosei said: What is “will not scorch [<i>lo yaḥarokh</i>]”? the Holy One Blessed be He does not extend [<i>yaarikh</i>] for the deceitful one and his deceit, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: That entire day, Esau was trapping gazelles and binding them, and an angel came and untied them, [trapping] birds, and tied their wings, and an angel would come and free them. Why to that extent? “But the wealth of a worthy [<i>yakar</i>] man is precious” (Proverbs 12:27) – so that Jacob, who was the glory of [<i>yekaro</i>] the world, would come and take the blessings, as from the outset of the world they were designated [<i>ḥarutzot</i>] for him. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa asked Rabbi Aḥa, he said to him: ‘What is what is written: “But the wealth of a worthy [<i>yakar</i>] man is precious [<i>ḥarutz</i>]”?’ He said: ‘It is designated [<i>ḥarutza</i>] in the hands of the righteous, who do not receive in this world any of the glory they have coming to them in the World to Come.’ <br>“And I ate from all [<i>mikol</i>]” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: Of everything [<i>mikol</i>] that was created during the six days of Creation. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Of all [<i>mikol</i>] the goodness that is reserved for the World to Come. <br>He [Esau] said to him [Isaac]: ‘What was the main course that he fed you?’ He said to him: ‘I do not know, but I tasted the taste of bread, the taste of meat, the taste of fish, the taste of grasshoppers, the taste of all the delicacies of the world.’ Rabbi Berekhya said: When he [Isaac] mentioned meat, he [Esau] immediately cried. He said: ‘He fed me one bowl of lentils and took my birthright. You, to whom he fed meat, all the more so.’ Rabbi Levi said: Because our patriarch Isaac was afraid and saying: ‘Did I, perhaps, not act properly, in that I rendered one who was not firstborn, firstborn?’ When he said: “He took my birthright” (Genesis 27:36), he said: ‘I gave the blessing properly.’ Rabbi Elazar said: Ratification of a document is only by its signatories, so that you will not say that had Jacob not deceived Isaac, he would not have received the blessings. The verse states: “Indeed, he shall be blessed.”
Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He [Isaac] sought to curse him [Jacob]. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Be careful, if you curse him, you are cursing yourself, as you said: “Cursed be one who curses you”’ (Genesis 27:29). <br>Rabbi Levi said: Six items serve a person; three are in his control, and three are not in his control. The eye, the ear, and the nose are not in his control – he sees what he does not wish, he hears what he does not wish, and he smells what he does not wish. The mouth, the hand, and the foot are in his control – [the mouth,] if he wishes he toils in Torah; if he wishes, [he speaks] evil speech; if he wishes, he curses and blasphemes. The hand, if he wishes, he performs a mitzva; if he wishes, he steals; if he wishes, he kills. His foot, if he wishes, he goes to theaters and circuses; and if he wishes, he goes to synagogues and study halls. When he merits, the Holy One blessed be He renders the ones in his control to be not in his control. The hand – “his hand that he had extended toward him shriveled” (I Kings 13:4); the mouth, “indeed, he shall be blessed” (Genesis 27:33); the foot, “My son, do not walk on the way with them…for their feet run to evil” (Proverbs 1:15–16).
<b>“When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out, a very great and bitter cry, and he said to his father: Bless me too, my father” (Genesis 27:34).</b> <br>“When Esau heard the words of his father” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: Anyone who says that the Holy One blessed be He is lax, may his intestines become lax. Rather, He shows patience and collects His due. Jacob caused Esau to cry out one cry, as it is written: “When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out.” Where did He punish him [Jacob]? It was in the Shushan citadel, as it is stated: “[When Mordekhai learned what had happened…] and cried out an exceedingly loud and bitter cry” (Esther 4:1). <br><b>“He said: Your brother came in cunning, and he took your blessing” (Genesis 27:35).</b> <br>“Your brother came in cunning [<i>bemirma</i>]” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He came with the wisdom of his Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded from the fact that the Torah used the word <i>mirma</i>, not <i>sheker</i>, <i>rama’ut</i>, or <i>honaa</i>.

But the righteous, their heart is subject to them. “Hannah, she was speaking in her heart” (I Samuel 1:13); “David said in his heart” (I Samuel 27:1); “Daniel resolved in his heart” (Daniel 1:8). They are like their Creator: “The Lord said in his heart” (Genesis 8:21). <br>“The days of mourning for my father will approach” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: Esau acted with patience. He said: ‘What, will I cause my father to break down?’ Instead, “the days of mourning for my father will approach, and I will kill” him. Rabbi Neḥemya said: A Divine Voice said: ‘Many young donkeys have died and their hides have been spread over their mothers.’ The Rabbis say: [Esau said:] ‘If I kill him, there are Shem and Ever who will sit in judgment over me, and say to me: Why did you kill your brother? Instead, I will go and marry into Ishmael’s family, and he will come and dispute with him [Jacob] over the birthright and kill him, and I will stand against him [Ishmael] as a blood redeemer and kill him, and I will be the heir of two families.’ That is what is written: “Because you said: The two nations and the two countries will be mine, and we will inherit it, and the Lord was there” (Ezekiel 35:10).

Therefore, Rebecca, who was a prophetess, had been told by God of Esau's plan, and knew that what she did would not cause destruction (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> And you say: “Do not touch My anointed ones; do not harm My prophets” (Psalms 105:15). <br>“She sent and summoned Jacob” – she said to him: ‘This wicked one, how much he regrets about you, how much he is accepting condolences [<i>mitnaḥem</i>] in your regard, and he has already drunk a cup of consolation over you.’

“Jacob departed from Beersheba, and went to Ḥaran” (Genesis 28:10) – Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Huna bar Pappa began: “Then you will walk on your way securely…. When you lie down, you will not be afraid” (Proverbs 3:23–24). “Then you will walk on your way securely” – this is Jacob, as it is written: “Jacob departed.” “When you lie down, you will not be afraid” – of Esau and Laban. “You will lie down and your sleep will be sweet” (Proverbs 3:24) – “and lay down in that place” (Genesis 28:11).

Rabbi Abbahu began: “House and wealth are the inheritance of fathers, but a capable wife is from the Lord” (Proverbs 19:14) – Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Abbahu: We find in the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings that a person’s match is only from the Holy One blessed be He. In the Torah, from where is it derived? “Laban and Betuel answered and said: The matter comes from the Lord” (Genesis 24:50). In the Prophets: “His father and his mother did not know that it was from the Lord” (Judges 14:4). In the Writings, that is what is written: “But a capable wife is from the Lord.” There are instances where one goes to his match and there are instances where one’s match comes to him. Isaac, his match came to him: “Behold, he saw camels coming” (Genesis 24:63). Jacob went to his match, as it is written: “Jacob departed.”
Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon began: “God settles the individuals in a home” (Psalms 68:7) – a noblewoman asked Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta, she said to him: ‘In how many days did the Holy One blessed be He create His world?’' He said to her: ‘In six days, as it is written: “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth”’ (Exodus 20:11). She said to him: ‘From that time until now, what has He been doing?’ He said to her: ‘He is sitting and matchmaking; the daughter of so-and-so to so-and-so, the wife<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to someone who has been widowed or divorced.</i> of so-and-so to so-and-so, the property of so-and-so to so-and-so.' She said to him: ‘That is his vocation. I, too, can do so. I have several slaves and I have several maidservants and I can make matches between them in a single moment.’ He said to her: ‘If it appears simple in your eyes, before the Holy One blessed be He, it is as difficult as the parting of the Red Sea.’ Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta went on his way. What did she do? She took one thousand slaves and one thousand maidservants and stood them in several lines. She said: ‘So-and so-man shall marry so-and-so woman, and so-and-so woman shall marry so-and-so man.’ She made matches between them in one night. The next day, they came to her. This one, his head was wounded, this one, his eye was gouged, this one, his leg was broken. She asked them ‘What do you want?’ This one said: ‘I do not want that one.’ That one said: ‘I do not want this one.’ Immediately, she sent and brought Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta. She said to him: ‘There is no God like your God. Your Torah is True, [it is] fine and praiseworthy, You spoke well.’ He said to her: ‘Is that not what I said to you? If it appears simple in your eyes, before the Holy One blessed be He it is as difficult as the parting of the Red Sea.’ What does the Holy One blessed be He do for them? He matches them against their will, not to their liking,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">They marry appropriate spouses even though they are not aware of that at the time of the wedding.</i> as it is stated: “God settles the individuals in a home; He liberates prisoners in chains [<i>bakosharot</i>]” (Psalms 68:7). What is “<i>bakosharot</i>”? It is with weeping [<i>bekhi</i>] and with song [<i>veshirot</i>]. One who is willing, with song, and one who is unwilling, weeps. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: In this language, Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta answered her: ‘The Holy One blessed be He sits and crafts ladders, and humbles this one and raise that one, lowers this one and elevates that one.’ As it says: “But it is God who is the Judge; He humbles this one and raises that one” (Psalms 75:8). There are instances where one goes to his match and there are instances where one’s match comes to him. Isaac, his match came to him, as it is stated: “Isaac went out walking in the field…[Behold, he saw camels coming]” (Genesis 24:63). Jacob went to his match, as it is written: “Jacob departed from Beersheba.”
Ḥizkiya said: Our patriarch Jacob was sixty-three years old when he took the blessings, [and] spent another fourteen years [during which] he was hidden in the house of Ever.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Megillah</i> 17a.</i> He spent another seven years that he worked for Rachel. The result is that he married a wife at the age of eighty-four years. Esau was at the age of forty years. We learned that the Holy One blessed be He delays for the righteous and moves forward for the wicked. <br>Rabbi Hoshaya said: It is already written: “Jacob heeded his father and his mother” (Genesis 28:7), why does the verse state: “Jacob departed from Beersheba.” It is, rather, that he said [to himself]: [My] father, when he sought to depart outside the Land of Israel, from where did he seek permission? Was it not from Beersheba?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear what the midrash is referring to here.</i> I, too, will go to Beersheba. If He gives me permission, I will depart, but if not, I will not depart. That is why it was necessary for the verse to say: “Jacob departed from Beersheba.”
“[Jacob] departed” – was he the only one who departed? Did several donkey drivers and several camel drivers not depart, and you say: “Jacob departed”? Rabbi [Ze’eira] Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: When the righteous man is in the city, he is its aura, he is its glory. Once he emerged from there, its aura has vacated, its glory has vacated. <br>Similarly, “she departed from the place where she had been…” (Ruth 1:7). “She departed” – was she the only one who departed from the place? Did several donkey drivers and several camel drivers not depart, and is says: “She departed”? Rabbi Azarya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon, and Rabbi Ḥanin in the name of Rabbi Shmuel the son of Rabbi Isaac said: When the righteous person is in the city, he is its aura, he is its glory. Once he emerged from there, its aura has vacated, its glory has vacated. There it works out well, as there was no one there other than that righteous woman. But here, Isaac and Rebecca were there. Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Simon: The merit of one righteous person is not comparable to the merit of two righteous people.
“From Beersheba” – Rabbi Yudan and Rav Huna, Rabbi Yudan said: From the source [<i>be’er</i>] of the oath [<i>shevua</i>]. He [Jacob] said: So that Avimelekh will not stand over me and say: ‘Take an oath to me just as your grandfather took an oath to me,’ and I will delay the joy of my descendants for seven generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham's oath caused a delay of seven generations. See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 54:4.</i> <br>Rav Huna said: [He departed] from the source of the birthright. He [Jacob] said: ‘So that Esau will not stand over me, challenge the birthright, and say: This is how you deceived me and took my birthright.’ The result will be that I will lose that oath, as it is stated: “Take an oath to me this day” (Genesis 25:33). <br>“From Beersheba” – Rabbi Berekhya said: From the source of the blessings. He [Jacob] said: ‘So that Esau would not stand over me and say to me: This is how you deceived me and took the blessings.’ The result will be that I will ruin all the toil that my mother toiled on my behalf.
“And went to Ḥaran [<i>Ḥarana</i>]” – the Rabbis said: On the same day. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: As people say: So-and-so went to Caesarea, and until now he has the provisions he set out with. <br><i>Ḥarana</i> – it is taught in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: Any word that requires a <i>lamed </i>at its start, a <i>heh</i> is placed at its end: <i>Sedoma</i>, <i>Se’ira</i>, <i>Mitzraima</i>, <i>Ḥarana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Both the <i>lamed </i>and the <i>heh </i>mean “to.” The <i>lamed</i> which appears at the beginning of the word can be replaced with a <i>heh</i> at the end of the word.</i> They raised an objection: But is it not written: “The wicked will return to the netherworld [<i>lishola</i>]”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">There is both a <i>lamed</i> at the beginning and a <i>heh</i> at the end.</i> (Psalms 9:18)?

<b>“He encountered the place and spent the night there because the sun had set; he took from the stones of the place, which he placed beneath his head, and lay down in that place” (Genesis 28:11).</b> <br>“He encountered [<i>vayifga</i>] the place” – Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Ami: Why do they change the name of the Holy One blessed be He and call Him the Omnipresent [<i>hamakom</i>]? It is because He is the place [<i>mekomo</i>] of the world, and His world is not His place. From what is written: “Behold, there is a place [<i>makom</i>] with Me” (Exodus 33:21) – the Holy One blessed be He is the place of the world, and His world is not His place.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">God is not contained in the world, he does not "live" there. He is the "place" of the world. The world exists because of Him.</i> <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “An abode of the God of eternity” (Deuteronomy 33:27). We do not know whether the Holy One blessed be He is the abode of the world, or whether the world is His abode. From what is written: “You are an abode for us” (Psalms 90:1) – that is, the Holy One blessed be He is the abode of the world, but His world is not His abode. <br>Rabbi Abba bar Yudan said: This is analogous to a warrior who was riding on a horse, and his garments were flowing to both sides. The horse is secondary to the rider, but the rider is not secondary to the horse, as it is stated: “You will ride on Your horses” (Habakkuk 3:8). <br>Another matter, what is <i>vayifga</i>? He prayed. “In the place” – he prayed in the Temple. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The early patriarchs instituted three prayers: Abraham instituted the morning prayer, as it is stated: “Abraham arose early in the morning to go to the place where he stood…” (Genesis<i> </i>19:27), and standing is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “Pinḥas stood and prayed” (Psalms<i> </i>106:30). Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “Isaac went out walking [<i>lasuaḥ</i>] in the field” (Genesis 24:63), and <i>siḥa </i>is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “I will pour out [<i>eshpoḥ</i>] my woe before Him” (Psalms 142:3). Jacob instituted the evening prayer, as it is stated:<i> </i>“He encountered<i> </i>[<i>vayifga</i>]<i> </i>the place,” and <i>pegia </i>is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “You, do not raise a cry [or a prayer] on their behalf, and do not plead with [<i>tifga</i>] Me” (Jeremiah 7:16). Likewise it says: “If they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, please, let them plead [<i>yifge’u</i>] with the Lord of hosts” (Jeremiah 27:18). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It is corresponding to the three times that the day changes. In the evening, a person must say: ‘May it be Your will, Lord my God, to take me out from darkness to light.’ In the morning, he must say: ‘I give thanks before You, Lord my God, that You have taken me from darkness to light.’ In the afternoon, a person must say: ‘May it be Your will, Lord my God, that just as you accorded me the privilege of seeing the sun in its rising, so You will accord me the privilege to see it in its setting.’ <br>Another matter, “he encountered the place” – the Rabbis say: It is corresponding to the daily offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is giving an alternative source for the three daily prayers.</i> The morning prayer, corresponding to the daily morning offering; the afternoon prayer, corresponding to the daily afternoon offering; the evening prayer is not obligatory. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Even the evening prayer is obligatory – corresponding to the limbs and fats that were consumed in the fire on the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The limbs and fats were also consumed in the fire at night.</i>
“He encountered the place” – he sought to pass, but the entire world became a barrier of sorts before him.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">So he could not continue on his way.</i> <br>“Because the sun had set” – the Rabbis say: “Because the sun had set” – it teaches that the Holy One blessed be He caused the orb of the sun to set not at its proper time, in order to speak with Jacob privately. This is analogous to a king’s friend who would come to him on occasion. The king said: ‘Extinguish the lamps, extinguish the lanterns, as I wish to speak with my friend privately.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He caused the orb of the sun to set not at its proper time, in order to speak with Jacob privately. <br>Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori: He heard the voices of the ministering angels saying: ‘The sun has arrived, the sun has arrived.’<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This was a reference to the fact that Jacob had come.</i> When Joseph said: “Behold, the sun and the moon” (Genesis 37:9), Jacob said: ‘Who revealed to him that My name is “sun”?’ <br>Those two hours that the Holy One blessed be He caused the orb of the sun to set when he left his father’s house, when did He restore them? It was when he returned to his father’s house. That is what is written: “The sun rose for him” (Genesis 32:32). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You are a model for your descendants; just as you, when you departed, I caused the sun to set, and upon your return, I restored the orb of the sun for you, so, your descendants, upon their departure: “The one who bore seven is miserable…[her sun set while still day]” (Jeremiah 15:9), and upon their return: “But the [sun of righteousness] will shine for those who fear My name…”’ (Malachi 3:20).
“He took from the stones of the place” (Genesis 28:11) – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda said: He took twelve stones. So, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that he would produce twelve tribes. He [Jacob] said: ‘Abraham did not produce them, Isaac did not produce them, I, if these twelve stones join with one another, I know that I will produce twelve tribes.’ When the twelve stones joined together one to another, he knew that he would produce twelve tribes. <br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: He took three stones. He said: ‘Abraham, the Holy One blessed be He designated His name upon him; Isaac, the Holy One blessed be He designated His name upon him; I, if these three stones join with one another, I know that He will designate His name upon me.’ When the three stones joined with one another, he knew that the Holy One blessed be He would designate His name upon him. <br>The Rabbis said: The minimum number of “stones” is two. Abraham, waste emerged from him – Ishmael and all the sons of Ketura. Isaac, Esau and all his chieftains emerged [from him]. I, if these two stones join with one another, I will know that waste will not emerge from me. <br>Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Zimra: He made them in the shape of a roof gutter and placed it beneath his head because he feared the beasts. <br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: It is written: “For, behold, the Lord emerges from His place, and will descend and tread on the heights of the earth. [The mountains will melt under Him, and the valleys will burst like wax before the fire, like waters poured down a slope]” (Micah 1:3–4).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Even in a place where God only ‘passes through,’ valleys burst like wax.</i> All the more so for one in a place where the Holy One blessed be He has revealed Himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The stones melt and are joined together in a place where God's presence is not transient.</i> <br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Those stones that Jacob placed under his head became like a bed and a feather pillow under him. What blossoming did he blossom there? “The beams of our houses are cedars, [and our rafters are junipers]” (Song of Songs 1:17) – the righteous men and women that emerged from him. <br>“And lay in that place” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: He lay here, but all fourteen years that he was hidden in the house of Ever, he did not lie. Rabbi Neḥemya said: He lay here, but all twenty years that he stayed in Laban’s house, he did not lie. What would he recite? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The fifteen songs of ascent in the book of Psalms.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 120–134.</i> What is his source? “A song of ascents, by David. [If the Lord had not been with us,] Let Israel now say” (Psalms 124:1) – Israel the elder.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He would say the entire book of Psalms.

<b>“He dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set on the earth, its top was reaching the heavens, and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it” (Genesis 28:12).</b> <br>“He dreamed, and behold, a ladder” – Rabbi Abbahu said: The content of dreams has no effect.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The dream should not be taken literally (<i>Yedei Moshe</i>).</i> There was a certain person who came before Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta. He said to him: ‘I saw in my dream that they were saying to me: Go and inherit your father’s business in Cappadocia.’ He said to him: ‘Has your father ever gone to Cappadocia?’ He said to him: ‘No.’ He said to him: ‘Go and count twenty beams in the roof of your house and you will find it.’ He said to him: ‘There are not twenty of them.’ He said to him: ‘If there are not twenty of them, count from their beginning to their end, and from their end to their beginning, and you will find it.’ He went, counted, and found it there. From where did Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta derive it? It is from Cappadocia [<i>Kappodekiya</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kappa</i> is the letter <i>kaf</i>, whose numerical value is twenty; <i>dokiya </i>means beams in Greek.</i> <br>Bar Kappara taught: There is no dream that does not have an interpretation. “Behold, a ladder” – this is the ramp;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In the Temple the priests ascended to the altar on a ramp.</i> “was set on the earth” – this is the altar; “you shall make for Me an altar of earth” (Exodus 20:21). “Its top was reaching the heavens” – these are the offerings whose fragrance reaches the heavens. “Behold, the angels of God” – these are the High Priests; “were ascending and descending on it” – as they ascend and descend on the ramp. “And, behold, the Lord was standing over him” (Genesis 28:13) – “I saw the Lord standing upon the altar” (Amos 9:1). <br>The Rabbis interpret it regarding Sinai. “He dreamed, and behold, a ladder” – this is Sinai. “Was set [<i>mutzav</i>] on the earth” – “they stood [<i>veyityatzvu</i>] at the foot of the mountain” (Exodus 19:17). “Its top was reaching the heavens” – “the mountain was burning with fire to the heart of the heavens” (Deuteronomy 4:11). <br>Another matter, “behold, a ladder” – this is Sinai.

[My Lord is among them, at Sinai]” (Psalms 68:18). We learned that prophets are called angels [<i>malakhim</i>], as it is written: “Haggai, the messenger [<i>malakh</i>] of the Lord, on a mission from the Lord, spoke to the people” (Haggai 1:13). “And behold, the angels of God” – this is Moses and Aaron. “Ascending” – “Moses ascended to God” (Exodus 19:3). “And descending” – this is Moses “Moses descended” (Exodus 19:14). “Behold, the Lord was standing over him” (Genesis 28:13) – “the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain” (Exodus 19:20). <br>Rabbi Salmoni said in the name of Reish Lakish: He [God] showed him [Jacob] a three-legged Throne of Glory. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: [God told Jacob] ‘You are the third leg.’ This is his opinion, as Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “For the portion of the Lord is His people; Jacob, the allotment of His inheritance” (Deuteronomy 32:9) – just as a rope is not woven with fewer than three, so, the patriarchs are no fewer than three. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: He showed him the world and one-third of the world. “Ascending [<i>olim</i>]” – are no fewer than two; “and descending” – two. From where is it derived that an angel is one-third of the world? It is as it is stated: “His body was like beryl [<i>tarshish</i>], his face like the appearance of lightning, his eyes like torches of fire, his arms and his legs like burnished bronze” (Daniel 10:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Sea of Tarshish is two thousand cubits and the area of the world is six thousand cubits, meaning that the body of each angel was one-third of the world.

The one who said: “Ascending and descending” on the ladder, it works out well. The one who said: “Ascending and descending” regarding Jacob, they were [both] exalting his honor and denigrating his honor.

Where did they return? It was here. “Ascending and descending” – ascending and then descending.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi interpreted the verse regarding the exile. “Jacob departed [<i>vayetze</i>] from Beersheba” (Genesis 28:10) – just as it says: “Send them from My presence, and let them go [<i>veyetze’u</i>]” (Jeremiah 15:1). “And went to Ḥaran” (Genesis 28:10) – just as it says: “With which the Lord has tormented me on the day of His enflamed wrath [<i>ḥaron apo</i>]” (Lamentations 1:12).  <br>“He encountered the place” (Genesis 28:11) – “until there is no more place” (Isaiah 5:8). “And stayed the night there because the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11) – “the one who bore seven is miserable…[her sun set while still day]” (Jeremiah 15:9). “He took from the stones from the place” (Genesis 28:11) – “The sacred stones are spilled at the head of every street” (Lamentations 4:1). “Which he placed beneath his head” (Genesis 28:11) – “[splendor] has come down from your heads” (Jeremiah 13:18). “And lay in that place” (Genesis 28:11) – “we will lie in our shame, and our humiliation will cover us” (Jeremiah 3:25). <br> “He dreamed, and behold, a ladder [<i>sulam</i>]” (Genesis 28:12) – this is Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. “Behold, a ladder” – this is Nebuchadnezzar’s idol; it is a symbol [<i>semel</i>], and it is a [<i>sulam</i>] – The letters of this are the letters of that.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sulam</i> – <i>samekh, lamed,</i> <i>mem.

He erected it in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylonia” (Daniel 3:1). “And behold, the angels of God” – this is Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya. “Were ascending and descending on it” – they were exalting his<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Nebuchadnezzar’s.</i> honor and denigrating his honor;<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">They said to him: ‘You are our king for taxes and land taxes, but as far as engaging in idol worship, you and a dog are equal’ (<i>Bemidbar Rabba </i>15:14).</i> dancing and leaping before him and denigrating: “Let it be known to you, king, that we will not worship your gods, and we will not prostrate ourselves to the golden image that you have erected” (Daniel 3:18). “Behold, the Lord was standing over him” (Genesis 28:13) – he said to Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya: “Servants of God Most High, emerge and come” (Daniel 3:26). <br>Another matter, “and behold, the angels of God” (Genesis 28:12) – this is Daniel. “Were ascending and descending on it” (Genesis 28:12) – he ascended and removed what it had swallowed from its mouth. That is what is written: “I will reckon with Bel in Babylon, and I will remove what it swallowed from its mouth” (Jeremiah 51:44). Nebuchadnezzar had a serpent and it would swallow everything that was cast before it. Nebuchadnezzar said to Daniel: ‘How great is its power, in that it swallows everything that is cast before it.' Daniel said to him: 'Give me permission and I will exhaust it.' He gave permission. What did he do? He took straw, concealed nails in it, cast it before it, and the nails perforated its innards. That is what is written: “I will remove what it swallowed from its mouth.”
Another matter, “behold, a ladder” (Genesis 28:12) – this is Nebuchadnezzar’s dream: “Behold, a giant image was set on the earth…its radiance surpassing, stood before you” (Daniel 2:31). “Its top was reaching the heavens” (Genesis 28:12)  – “the image, which was great” (Daniel 2:31). “Behold, the angels of God” (Genesis 28:12) – two ascending and two descending; these are the angels of the four kingdoms, whose dominion ends with them. “Ascending and descending” (Genesis 28:12) – “descending and ascending” is not written, but rather, “ascending and descending.” They ascend; it will be an ascent for them, but each of them is lower than its predecessor. It is written: “That image, its head was of [fine] gold, [its breast and its arms of silver]…” (Daniel 2:32). Babylon was above them all, as it is written: “You are the head of gold” (Daniel 2:38). And it is written: “After you, will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours” (Daniel 2:39), and it is written: “And afterward a third kingdom, of bronze” (Daniel 2:39). And it is written at the end: “The toes of the feet, some of them iron, and some of them earthenware – part of the kingdom will be strong, and some of it will be brittle” (Daniel 2:42). “Behold, the Lord was standing over him” (Genesis 28:13) – it is written: “In the days of those kings, the God of the heavens will establish a kingdom that will be eternal…” (Daniel 2:44).

Where? “In a parched and thirsty land without water.” “Indeed, in the Sanctuary I have seen You” (Psalms 63:3) – in sanctity I have seen You; “beholding Your power” (Psalms 63:3) – this is Your entourage; “and Your glory” (Psalms 63:3) – “and, behold, the Lord was standing over him.”
Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina began: “Iron sharpens iron” (Proverbs 27:17) – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: [Just as] a knife is sharpened only on the side of its counterpart, so, a Torah scholar is sharpened only by his counterpart. “Iron sharpens iron, and a man in the presence of another” (Proverbs 27:17). “A man” – this is Jacob. When our patriarch Jacob stood, ”a man in the presence of another” – as the Divine Presence was associated with him; “and, behold, the Lord was standing over him.”
Rabbi Abahu said: This is analogous to the son of kings, who would sleep in his cradle and flies would alight on him. When his nursemaid came, she bent over him and suckled him and they flew away from upon him. So, initially, “behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it” (Genesis 28:12). When the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself they fled from on it. Rabbi Ḥiyya Rabba and Rabbi Yanai, one said: “On it” – on the ladder; and one said: “On it” – on Jacob. The one who said: “On it,” on the ladder, it works out well. However, according to the one who said: “On it,” regarding Jacob, does He stand over him? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The wicked stand over their gods – “Pharaoh was dreaming, and behold, he stood over the Nile” (Genesis 41:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Egyptians worshipped the Nile.</i> But the righteous, their God stands over them, as it is stated: “Behold, the Lord was standing over him, and said: I am the Lord, God of Abraham.”
Rabbi Ḥanina said in the name of Rabbi Pinḥas: It mentions the patriarchs eighteen times in the Torah, and corresponding to it, the Sages instituted the eighteen blessings in prayer.

<b>“Your descendants will be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread out to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you and your descendants” (Genesis 28:14).</b> <br>“Your descendants will be as the dust” – just as the dust is blessed only by means of water, so, your descendants will be blessed only by means of Torah, that is likened to water. Just as the dust of the earth outlasts all metal vessels and endures forever, so, your descendants will outlast the entire world and endure forever. Just as dust is trodden upon by all, so, your children will be trodden upon. That is what is written: “I will place it into the hand of your oppressors [<i>mogayikh</i>]” (Isaiah 51:23). What is <i>mogayikh</i>? It is those that cause your wounds to liquefy [<i>memagin</i>], torment you, and sap your strength. Nevertheless, it is for your benefit, as they purify and cleanse you from your iniquities, just as it says: “Soften [<i>temogegena</i>] it with showers, bless its vegetation” (Psalms 65:11). “Who said to your soul: Bow, and we will pass” (Isaiah 51:23) – what would they do to them?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The oppressors to the Jews.</i> They would lie them down in the streets and pass wagons with plows over them.

What is the source? “Jacob departed from Beersheba…he dreamed and behold, a ladder…he was frightened, and he said: How awesome is this place.” Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: The ladder was standing at the Temple and its incline reached Beit El. What is the source? “He was frightened, and he said: How awesome is this place…He called the name of that place Beit El” (Genesis 28:17–19). <br>“This is nothing other than the house of God, and this is the gate of the heavens” – Rav Aḥa said: This gate is destined to open for many righteous men like you. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: The supernal Temple is only eighteen <i>mil<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mil </i>is a measure of distance.</i> </i>higher than the earthly Temple.

What would the elderly among them do? When they would become very old, they would take them outside the walls and they would die. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Why is it called Luz?

There was a hollow almond tree and they would enter the cave through the almond tree and through the cave to the city. That is what is written: “The sentries saw a man emerging from the city, and they said to him: Show us now the way into the city, and we will act benevolently with you.

Chapter 70

<b>“Jacob took a vow, saying: If God will be with me, and He will keep me on this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and a garment to wear” (Genesis 28:20).</b> <br>“Jacob took a vow, saying: If God will be with me…and will give me bread to eat.” It is written: “Those uttered by my lips and spoken by my mouth when I was in distress” (Psalms 66:14) – Rabbi Yitzḥak HaBavli said: “And spoken by my mouth when I was in distress” – as he vowed to perform a mitzva in his time of distress. What is “saying”? It is: Saying to the generations, so they would take vows in their time of distress. Jacob began with a vow first; therefore, anyone who takes a vow will ascribe the vow only to him. Rabbi Abbahu said: It is written: “Who took an oath to the Lord and took a vow to the Champion of Jacob” (Psalms 132:2) – to the Champion of Abraham or to the Champion of Isaac is not written here, but rather, “took a vow to the Champion of Jacob” – he ascribed the vow to the one who began with it first.
Rav Huna said in the name of Rav Idi: It is written: “The people rejoiced in their donation, because they donated to the Lord wholeheartedly, and King David too rejoiced with great joy” (I Chronicles 29:9) – because they were engaged in the mitzva of donation and they were successful, that is why they rejoiced. Therefore, what does it say? “David blessed the Lord before the eyes of the entire congregation [and David said: Blessed is the Lord, God of Israel our father]…” (I Chronicles 29:10). It does not say here: “God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,” but rather, “God of Israel our father” – he ascribed the vow to the one who began with it first. Rabbi Yehuda said: This place is also not lacking.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There is no need to go to Chronicles for proof, as there is proof elsewhere in the Bible.</i> “Israel took a vow [<i>vayidru</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Plural.</i>” is not written here, but rather, “Israel took a vow [<i>vayidar</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Singular.</i>” (Numbers 21:2) – Israel the elder.

Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Yoḥanan, one said: The portion is out of order. The other said: It was stated in order. The one who said: The portion is out of order, as the Holy One blessed be He had already promised him, as it is stated: “Behold, I am with you” (Genesis 28:15), and he says: “If God will be with me”? The one who says: It was stated in order, how do I understand: “If God will be with me”? It is, rather, that this is what Jacob said: ‘If the conditions that He said, to be with me and to keep me, will be fulfilled, I will fulfill my vow.’ <br><b>“And I return to my father’s house in peace, the Lord will be my God” (Genesis 28:21).</b> <br>Rabbi Abbahu and the Rabbis, Rabbi Abbahu said: “If God will be with me, and He will keep me on this way [<i>derekh</i>] that I go” (Genesis 28:20) – from evil speech, just as it says: “They drew [<i>vayadrekhu</i>] their tongues, their bows of falsehood” (Jeremiah 9:2). “And will give me bread to eat” (Genesis 28:20) – from illicit sexual relations, just as it says: “He did not know anything with him except the bread that he eats” (Genesis 39:6) – a euphemism.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A euphemism for Potiphar’s wife.</i> “And I return to my father’s house in peace” (Genesis 28:21) – from bloodshed. “The Lord will be my God” (Genesis 28:21) – from idol worship. The Rabbis interpret all the matters from it: “If God will be with me, and He will keep me on this way [<i>derekh</i>] that I go” – from idol worship, from illicit sexual relations, from bloodshed, from evil speech. <i>Derekh</i> is nothing other than idol worship, just as it says: “Those who take an oath by the sin of Samaria, and say: As your god lives, Dan, and: As the way [<i>derekh</i>] of Beersheba lives” (Amos 8:14). <i>Derekh</i> is nothing other than illicit sexual relations, as it is stated: “So is the way [<i>derekh</i>] of an adulterous woman…” (Proverbs 30:20). <i>Derekh </i>is nothing other than bloodshed, as it is stated: “My son, do not walk on a way with them; prevent your foot from their pathway […and they are quick to spill blood]” (Proverbs 1:15–16). <i>Derekh</i> is nothing other than evil speech,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from the verse cited above: “They drew [<i>vayadrekhu</i>] their tongues, their bows of falsehood” (Jeremiah 9:2).</i> as it is stated: “He heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying: Jacob has taken…” (Genesis 31:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Lavan’s sons slandered Jacob.</i>
“And will give me bread to eat, and a garment to wear” (Genesis 28:20) – Akilas the proselyte entered to Rabbi Eliezer, he said to him: ‘Is this all the benefit of the proselyte, as it is stated: “And loves the stranger, to give him food and a garment”?’ (Deuteronomy 10:18). He said to him: ‘Is it insignificant in your eyes, the item regarding which this elder pondered, as it is stated: “And will give me bread to eat, and a garment to wear”?

I pay no attention even to my servants.’ He reprimanded him, and he went to Rabbi Yehoshua. His students said to him: ‘The item regarding which this elder pondered, you extend it to him on a reed? He came before Rabbi Yehoshua]. <br>He began placating him with words: “Bread” – this is Torah, as it is written: “Come, partake of my bread” (Proverbs 9:5). “Garment” – this is a cloak.

That was in the Temple, but in the outlying areas, “bread” – this is <i>ḥalla</i>, “and a garment” – these are the first shearing. They said: ‘Were it not for the forbearance that Rabbi Yehoshua demonstrated with Akilas the proselyte, he would have returned to his evil ways. He read in his regard: “One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty”’ (Proverbs 16:32).
“And I return to my father’s house in peace” – Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One blessed be He took the conversations of the patriarchs and rendered them the key to the redemption of the descendants. The Holy One blessed be He said to him [Jacob]: ‘You said: “[The Lord] will be [<i>vehaya</i>] my God,” as you live, all the goodness, blessings, and consolations that I give to your children, I give it to them only in this language,’ as it is stated: “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day that spring water will emerge from Jerusalem” (Zechariah 14:8). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day that the Lord will continue, setting His hand a second time to acquire the remnant of His people” (Isaiah 11:11). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day, that the mountains will drip nectar” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day that a great shofar will be sounded…” (Isaiah 27:13).

They said: He is well, and here is Rachel his daughter, coming with the sheep” (Genesis 29:6).</b> <br>“Jacob said to them: My brethren…” – Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina interpreted the verses regarding the exile. “Jacob said to them…we are from Ḥaran” – we are fleeing from the wrath [<i>ḥaron af</i>] of the Holy One blessed be He. “He said to them: Do you know Laban, son of Naḥor?” – do you know who is destined to cleanse your iniquities like snow? “He said to them: Is he well? They said: He is well” – by what merit? “Here is Rachel his daughter, coming with the sheep” – that is what is written: “So said the Lord: A voice is heard in Rama, wailing, bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be consoled…So said the Lord: Restrain your voice from weeping…there is hope for your future” (Jeremiah 31:15–17).
“He said to them: Is he well [<i>hashalom lo</i>]?” – is there peace [<i>hashalom</i>] between you and him? “They said: He is well,” – but if it is prattle that you seek: “Here is Rachel his daughter, coming with the sheep.” That is what is said: Speech is found among women. <br><b>“He said: Behold, the day is still great, it is not time for the livestock to be gathered; give the sheep to drink, and go and herd” (Genesis 29:7).</b> <br>“He said: Behold, [the day] is still…” – he said to them: ‘If you are hired watchmen, “the day is still great.” If you are herding your own, “it is not time for the livestock to be gathered.”’ <br><b>“He was still speaking with them, and Rachel came with her father’s flock; for she was a shepherdess” (Genesis 29:9).</b> <br>“He was still speaking with them, and Rachel came” – come and see the difference between neighborhood and neighborhood. Elsewhere, they were seven,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Jethro had seven daughters.</i> and the shepherds sought to confront them. That is what is written: “The shepherds came and drove them away” (Exodus 2:17). However, here, it was one, and no person touched her, because: “The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and rescues them” (Psalms 34:8) – to those who are proximate to those who fear him.
<b>“It was when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the flock of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob approached, rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother” (Genesis 29:10).</b> <br>“It was when Jacob saw…Jacob approached, rolled the stone” – like one who is removing a stopper from the mouth of a jug. <br><b>“Jacob kissed Rachel, and raised his voice, and wept” (Genesis 29:11).</b> <br>“Jacob kissed Rachel” – every kiss is for promiscuity except for three: A kiss of greatness; a kiss of reunion; a kiss of parting. A kiss of greatness – “Samuel took the flask of oil, poured onto his head, and kissed him” (I Samuel 10:1). A kiss of reunion – “He went and he met him at the mountain of God and he kissed him” (Exodus 4:27). A kiss of parting – “Orpa kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her” (Ruth 1:14). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: A kiss of kinship as well, as it is stated: “Jacob kissed Rachel,” who was his relative. <br>“And raised his voice, and wept” – why did he weep? He said: ‘Eliezer, when he went to bring Rebecca, what is written in his regard? “The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master…” (Genesis 24:10), but I do not have even one nose-ring or one bracelet.’ <br>Another matter, why did he weep? It is because he saw that she would not enter into the grave with him. That is what she [Rachel] said to her [Leah]: “That is why he will lie with you tonight” (Genesis 30:15) – he will lie with you, and he will not lie with me.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Lie, in the sense of burial.</i> <br>Another matter, why did he weep? It is because he saw people whispering to one another because he kissed her, [saying]: ‘What, has this one come to introduce a matter of lewdness in our midst?’ This is because from the time that the world was stricken in the generation of the Flood, the nations of the world stood and distanced themselves from lewdness. That is what is said: The people of the East are distanced from lewdness.
<b>“Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebecca’s son, and she ran and told her father” (Genesis 29:12).</b> <br>“Jacob told Rachel that he was [her father’s] brother, and that he was Rebecca’s son” – if being deceitful, “that he was her father’s brother”; if being righteous, “that he was Rebecca’s son.” <br>“And she ran and told her father” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A woman is always accustomed only to her mother’s house. He<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">One of the students.</i> raised an objection: ‘But is it not written: “She ran and told her father”?’ He said to him: ‘It is because her mother had died. Who should she have told if not her father?’  <br><b>“It was when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, embraced him, kissed him, and brought him to his house. He related to Laban all these matters” (Genesis 29:13).</b> <br>“It was when Laban heard…” – he [Laban] said: ‘Eliezer was the most defective one of the household, as it is written: “The servant took ten camels” <sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states that he was only a servant.</i> (Genesis 24:10); this one, who is the most beloved of the household, all the more so.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">He will have riches with him.</i>’ When he did not see even a knapsack, “he embraced him” – he said: ‘They are dinars and they are in his belt.’ When he found nothing, “he kissed him” – he said: ‘Perhaps they are gems and they are in his mouth.’ When he did not see anything, Jacob said to him: ‘What do you think, that I came bearing money? I came only bearing words’ – “He related to Laban.”
<b>“Laban said to him: Indeed, you are my bone and my flesh, and he stayed with him a month’s time” (Genesis 29:14).</b> <br>“Laban said to him: Indeed, you are my bone and my flesh…” – he said to him: ‘I was thinking to render you a king over me, but now that you have nothing with you, “indeed, you are my bone and my flesh.” I will strip you bare like this bone.’ <br>“He stayed with him a month’s time” – Rabbi Ami said: The Torah teaches you etiquette. For how long must a person tend to his relatives? It is up to a month. <br><b>“Laban said to Jacob: Because you are my brother, shall you work for me for nothing?

<b>“Leah’s eyes were delicate and Rachel was of beautiful form and of beautiful appearance” (Genesis 29:17).</b> <br>“Leah’s eyes were delicate” – Rabbi Yoḥanan’s disseminator interpreted: Leah’s eyes were weak.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">From birth.</i> He said to him: ‘Your mother’s eyes were weak.’ What is delicate?

Moreover, she preceded her sister. <br>“Rachel was of beautiful form” – the primary distinctive characteristic of Rachel was that she was fair – “Rachel was…”
<b>“Jacob loved Rachel, and he said: I will work for you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter” (Genesis 29:18).</b>  <br>“Jacob loved Rachel” – [Jacob said to Laban:] ‘Because I know that the residents of your place are deceitful, that is why I am clarifying my deal with you. “He said: I will work for you…for Rachel, your…daughter” – Rachel but not Leah. “Your daughter” – so you will not bring another from the marketplace whose name is Rachel. “Younger” – so you will not exchange their names for one another. Even if you place a wicked one in a carpenter’s vise, it will be of no avail to you.’ <br><b>“Laban said: Better that I give her to you, than give her to another man; remain with me” (Genesis 29:19). <br>“Jacob worked seven years for Rachel; they were in his eyes but a few days, in his love of her” (Genesis 29:20).</b> <br>“Laban said: Better that I give her to you…Jacob worked…for Rachel [they were in his eyes but a few [<i>aḥadim</i>] days]” – Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pazi said: <i>Aḥadim</i> is stated here and <i>aḥadim</i> is stated elsewhere: “Live with him a few [<i>aḥadim</i>] years” (Genesis 27:44). Just as here, it is seven years, so, too, elsewhere, it is seven years.
<b>“Jacob said to Laban: Give me my wife, as my time is fulfilled, and I will consort with her” (Genesis 29:21).</b> <br>“Jacob said to Laban: Give me my wife” – Rabbi Aivu said: Even a dissolute person does not use that language, but Jacob said so: “Give me my wife…and I will consort with her”? Rather, this is what he said to him: ‘The Holy One blessed be He said to me that I would produce twelve tribes. Now, I am approximately eighty-four years old, and if I do not produce them now, when will I produce them?’ That is why it was necessary for the verse to say: “Jacob said to Laban: Give me my wife.”
<b>And Laban gathered the residents of the place and made a feast (Genesis 29:22).</b> <br><b>When the night came he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he had relations with her (Genesis 29:23).</b> <br><b>And Laban gave his maidservant Zilpa to his daughter Leah as a maidservant (Genesis 29:24).</b> <br><b>“It was in the morning and, behold, she was Leah; he said to Laban: What is this that you did to me? Did I not work with you for Rachel, and why did you deceive me?” (Genesis 29:25).</b> <br>“Laban gathered all the people of the place, and made a feast” (Genesis 29:22). He gathered all the people of his place. He said to them: ‘You know that we were hard-pressed for water, but once this righteous man came here, the water was blessed.’ [They said to him:] ‘What can we do for you?’ He said to them: ‘If you wish, I will deceive him, and give him Leah, as he loves this Rachel greatly, and he will spend another seven years with you.’ They said to him: ‘Do as you please.’ He said to them: ‘Give me collateral that no one of you will disclose it.’ They gave him collateral and he obtained with it wine, oil, and meat. That is why he is called Laban the Aramean; because he deceived [<i>sherima</i>] the people of his place. All day they were praising him.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob.</i> When night fell, he said to them: ‘What is this?’ They told him ‘You performed an act of kindness with your merit.’ They were lauding before him, and saying: ‘It is fitting, it is fitting [<i>ha laya ha laya</i>] – she is Leah, she is Leah.’<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">They were hinting to the fact that the bride was Leah.</i> At night, they brought the bride and covered the lamps.

(Genesis 29:25). “Laban said: So will not be done…complete the week for this one…” – Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa said: From here we learn that one does not mix joy with joy, but rather, “complete the week for this one…”
<b>“He also consorted with Rachel; he also loved Rachel more than Leah.

However, here, just as the first ones were complete, so, the latter ones were complete. Just as the first ones were performed faithfully, so, the latter ones were performed faithfully. <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is written: “Jacob fled to the field of Aram, and Israel worked for a wife…” (Hosea 12:13). He [Hosea] said to them: ‘Your redemption is modeled after your patriarch Jacob.

Chapter 71

<b>“The Lord saw that Leah was unloved, and He opened her womb, and Rachel was barren” (Genesis 29:31).</b> <br>“The Lord saw that Leah was unloved…” “For the Lord hears the impoverished and does not despise His prisoners” (Psalms 69:34) – Rabbi Binyamin ben Levi said: The beginning of this verse does not correspond with its end, nor does its end correspond to its beginning. The verse should have said only: “For the Lord hears the impoverished and does not despise the prisoners” or: “For the Lord hears His impoverished and…His prisoners.” Rather: “For the Lord hears the impoverished” – this is Israel, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Every place that impoverished [<i>dal</i>], poor [<i>ani</i>], and indigent [<i>evyon</i>] is stated, the verse is speaking of Israel. “And does not despise His prisoners” – these are the barren women, who are prisoners in their homes, and forlorn. But when the Holy One blessed be He remembers them with children, they stand erect. Know that Leah was the unloved one of the household, but when the Holy One blessed be He remembered her, she stood erect. That is what is written: “The Lord saw that Leah was unloved.”
Another matter, “The Lord supports all those who fall” (Psalms 145:14) – these are the barren women, who fall inside their houses. “And He straightens all who are hunched” (Psalms 145:14) – when the Holy One blessed be He remembers them with children, they stand erect. Know that it is so, as Leah was the unloved one of the household, but when the Holy One blessed be He remembered her, she stood erect. That is what is written: “The Lord saw that Leah was unloved.” <br>“That Leah was unloved [<i>senua</i>]” – she performed the action of the hated [<i>hasenuim</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Sinners, who spend their time praying for repentance.</i> as she would say that she would marry the enemy [<i>lasoneh</i>],”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Esau.</i> <variant reading, that she was supposed to be for the hated>. These were the stipulations: The elder to the elder, and the younger to the younger. She would weep and say: ‘May it be His will that I will not fall in the portion of that wicked man.’ Rav Huna said: Prayer is powerful, as it nullified the decree. Moreover, she preceded her sister. Everyone would mock her – seafarers would mock her, wayfarers would mock her, even those sitting in the pits behind the loom would mock her. They said: ‘This Leah, her inside is not like her outside; she appears like a righteous woman, but she is not a righteous woman. Were she a righteous woman, she would not have deceived her sister.’ <br>Rabbi Ḥanin said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak: When Jacob our patriarch saw the actions that Leah deceived her sister, he set his mind to divorce her. When the Holy One blessed be He remembered her with children, he said: ‘Am I divorcing the mother of these?’ Ultimately, he gave thanks for this matter. That is what is written: “Israel prostrated himself at the top of the bed [<i>al rosh hamita</i>]” (Genesis 47:31). Who is the <i>rosh mitato<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The mother of the majority of his children.</i></i> of our patriarch Jacob? Is it not Leah? <br>“And Rachel was barren [<i>akara</i>]” – Rachel was the primary of the household, just as it says: “Rachel was <i>akara</i>” – the primary [<i>ikara</i>] was Rachel. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Most of the participants in the feast<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the wedding feast of Boaz and Ruth.</i> were primarily from Leah; that is why Rachel is rendered primary<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“May the Lord grant that the woman who is coming into your house will be like Rachel and like Leah” (Ruth 4:11).</i> – Rachel was barren [<i>akara</i>]” – Rachel was the primary of the household. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: Because all the matters are dependent on Rachel, that is why Israel is called by her name: “Rachel weeps for her children” (Jeremiah 31:15). Not only is it by her name, but also by her son’s name: “Perhaps the Lord, God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph” (Amos 5:15). And not only by her son’s name, but by the name of her grandson, as it is stated: “Is Ephraim a dear son to me?” (Jeremiah 31:20).
<b>“Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; she said: Because the Lord saw [<i>raa</i>] my affliction; for now my husband will love me” (Genesis 29:32).</b> <br>“Leah conceived and bore a son” – Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Four qualities were stated regarding names: There are those whose names are fair and their actions are fair; some whose names are foul and their actions are foul; some whose names are foul and their actions are fair; and some whose names are foul and their actions are fair.  <br>Their names are fair and their actions are foul – Esau.

Reuben – see this son [<i>re’u ven</i>] among the sons. Simeon [<i>Shimon</i>] – listens [<i>shome’a</i>] to the voice of his Father in Heaven. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: The names of the tribes are not inappropriate for them, but rather, they are appropriate for them.
<b>“She conceived again, and bore a son, and said: Because the Lord heard that I am hated, He gave me this as well.

Therefore, she called his name Judah, and she ceased bearing” (Genesis 29:35).</b> <br>“She conceived again, and bore a son; she said: This time I will thank [<i>odeh</i>] the Lord. [Therefore, she called his name Judah [<i>Yehuda</i>]]” – Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Levi: This is analogous to a priest who descended to the threshing floor. One gave him a <i>kor<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kor</i> is 30 <i>seim</i>. The equivalent of about 250 liters.</i> </i>of tithe, but he showed him no gratitude. And one gave him a handful of non-sacred produce, and he showed him gratitude. He [the first man] said to him: ‘My lord priest, I gave you a <i>kor</i>, and that one gave you only a handful, and you show gratitude to him?’ He said to him: ‘You gave me from my portion, but that one gave me from his own; that is why I showed him gratitude.’ So, because the matriarchs believed that this one would have three, and that one would have three, when Leah bore a fourth son, she said: “This time I will thank the Lord.”
That is what is written: “Take from them one staff for each [<i>mateh mateh</i>] patrilineal house” (Numbers 17:17) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: My children have stumbled [<i>matu matu</i>]; they stumbled with the calf, they stumbled with the spies.

Rabbi Eliezer said: From Benjamin, as it is written: “Yaareshya, Eliya, and Zikhri were the sons of Yeroḥam…all these are the children of Benjamin” (I Chronicles 8:27, 40).

<b>“Reuben went during the days of wheat harvest, found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to Leah, his mother. Rachel said to Leah: Please give me from your son’s mandrakes” (Genesis 30:14).</b> <br>“Reuben went during the days of wheat harvest.” “Train the lad in accordance with his way; even when he grows old, he will not turn from it” (Proverbs 22:6). “May this land be given to your servants…” (Numbers 32:5). <br>“The sated were hired for bread, but the hungry have ceased; while the barren has borne seven, the one with many children is miserable” (I Samuel 2:5). “The sated were hired [<i>niskaru</i>] for bread” – this is Leah, who was sated with sons and was rewarded [<i>niskara</i>]. “But the hungry have ceased [<i>ḥadelu</i>]” – this is Rachel, who was hungry for children but was stymied [<i>ḥadela</i>]. “While the barren [<i>akara</i>] has borne seven” – this is Leah, who was the primary one [<i>ikara</i>] in the household, and bore seven. “The one with many children is miserable” – this is Rachel, who was worthy to have the majority of the children emerge from her, and was miserable. Who did this? It is: “The Lord puts to death and brings to life” (I Samuel 2:6).
“Reuben went during the days of wheat harvest, found mandrakes” – Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Mandrakes; Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Barley; Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: The hackberry tree. Both according to these and according to those, everyone agrees that he brought only from the ownerless. According to the one who said barley, during the days of the wheat harvest, barley is ownerless, as the barley harvest has already concluded. Know that he went at the time of the harvest, at the time of the ripening of all kinds of summer fruits, but brought only an item that was from the ownerless. This is to inform you that they would distance themselves from robbery of the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">They would not pick fruit off of trees.</i> If they would distance themselves in that manner from robbery of the land, all the more so, they distanced themselves from all types of robbery.  <br>“And brought them to Leah, his mother” – to inform you to what extent his mother’s honor was important to him, as he did not taste them until he brought them to his mother.
<b>She said to her: Is the taking of my husband insignificant, that you take my son’s mandrakes, as well? Rachel said: Therefore, he will lie with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes” (Genesis 30:15).</b> <br>“Rachel said to Leah: Please give me from your son’s mandrakes…is the taking of my husband insignificant” – will you take from my beard for my grandfather?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">My grandfather’s beard is full and mine is sparse, will you take from mine for his? This is a metaphor; Leah was saying: Jacob loves you more than he loves me.

That is what she said to her: “Therefore, he will lie with you tonight” – he will lie in death with you; he will not lie in death with me. <br>Rabbi Elazar said: This one lost and that one lost, this one gained and that one gained. Leah lost mandrakes and gained two tribes and primacy.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">She became the mother to the greatest number of Jacob’s sons.</i> Rachel gained mandrakes and lost tribes and primacy.

<b>“Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said: You will consort with me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes. He lay with her that night” (Genesis 30:16). <br>“God listened to Leah and she became pregnant and gave birth to Jacob, a fifth son” (Genesis 30:17).</b> <br>“Jacob came from the field in the evening” – there we learned: One who hires laborers and stipulates with them to rise early and to continue late, in a place where they are accustomed not to rise early or to continue late, he is not permitted to compel them. Rabbi Muna said: In a place where there is no custom, it is a stipulation of the High Court that going out will be at the expense of the employer,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The laborer is not required to go to work until sunrise.</i> and coming in will be at the expense of the laborer.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The laborer is required to work until dark.</i> <br>Going out is at the expense of the employer, from where is it derived? “When the sun rises, they will gather” (Psalms 104:22). From then on: “A person goes out to his work” (Psalms 104:23). Coming in will be at the expense of the laborer, from where is it derived? “And to his labor until evening [<i>adei erev</i>]” (Psalms 104:23) – “<i>ad erev</i>” is not stated, but rather, “<i>adei erev</i>,” meaning until dark, just as it says: “until complete darkness [<i>adei neshef</i>]” (Job 7:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Erev </i>can mean until sunset, and it can mean until it is dark. <i>Neshef</i> means when it is dark. A verbal analogy is being used to teach that the worker returns home when it is dark, and does not return home by sunset.</i> Rabbi Ami said in the name of Reish Lakish: They imposed upon the employer that if it was the day before Shabbat, the coming in would be at his expense. To what extent? It is so each and every one would fill a barrel of water for himself and roast a fish for himself while it is still day, in deference to Shabbat, and to kindle a lamp, as it is stated: “Jacob came from the field in the evening.” That is what is written: “And to his labor until evening.”

That is why it was necessary for the verse to say: “God heeded Leah” (Genesis 30:17). <br>“And said: You will consort with me” – Rabbi Levi said: Come and see how pleasing the mediation of mandrakes was before the One who spoke and the world came into being, as, by means of the mandrakes, two great tribes in Israel were produced – Issachar and Zebulun. Issachar sits and engages in Torah study, Zebulun sets out to the seas and comes and provides for Issachar’s mouth, and the Torah proliferates in Israel – “the mandrakes emitted fragrance” (Song of Songs 7:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They emitted a pleasant fragrance before the Lord.</i> <br><b>“Leah said: God has given me my reward, because I gave my maidservant to my husband.

That is what is written: “On the second day, Netanel ben Tzuar, prince of Issachar, presented his offering” (Numbers 7:18). Why was that? It is because he was a Torah personality. That is what is written: “From the children of Issachar, possessors of understanding of the times” (I Chronicles 12:33). What is “of the times”? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Of the propitious time for everything. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Of intercalations.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Intercalations of years and months</i>  <br>“Their leaders were two hundred, and all their brethren at their command” (I Chronicles 12:33) – Issachar would produce two hundred heads of the Sanhedrin, and all their brethren in accordance with them, and they all agreed to rule <i>halakha </i>in accordance with them, and he would answer them with <i>halakha</i> like a <i>halakha </i>transmitted to Moses at Sinai. From where did Issachar come to all this prominence? It was from Zebulun, who would engage in his commerce, and would feed Issachar, who was a Torah personality. That is what is written: “Zebulun will dwell at the shore of seas” (Genesis 49:13). When Moses came to bless the tribes, he had the blessing of Zebulun precede the blessing of Issachar: “Of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in your departure, and, Issachar, in your tents” (Deuteronomy 33:18) – Rejoice, Zebulun, in your departure<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Departure on business trips.</i> from the fact that Issachar is in your tents.

“God remembered Rachel.” “He remembered His kindness and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth beheld the salvation of our God” (Psalms 98:3). “He remembered His kindness” – this is Abraham, as it is stated: “Kindness to Abraham” (Micah 7:20). “And his faithfulness” – this is Jacob, as it is stated: “Give truth to Jacob” (Micah 7:20); “To the house of Israel” – Israel the elder. Who was the house of our patriarch Jacob? Was it not Rachel? Regarding all of them it is written: “The children of Leah, the firstborn of Jacob, Reuben” (Genesis 35:23); “the children of Zilpa, maidservant of Leah, Gad and Asher” (Genesis 35:26); “the children of Bilha, maidservant of Rachel, Dan and Naphtali” (Genesis 35:25). But regarding Rachel it is written: “The children of Rachel, Jacob’s wife” (Genesis 46:19). <br>Another matter, “He remembered His kindness and His faithfulness to the house of Israel” – “God remembered Rachel, and God heeded her.”
“He redeemed me unharmed from the battle waged against me [<i>mikerav li</i>], for there were many with me” (Psalms 55:19) – this is Jacob. “<i>Mikerav li</i>”<i> </i>– so that the counsel of that wicked one [Laban] will not come near me [<i>shelo tikrav li</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Will not affect me.</i> so that he [Laban] will not say: ‘He [Jacob] will take with him this one, who bore children, and that one, who did not bear children, he will not take with him,’ as Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: Rachel was remembered due to many prayers, as it is stated: “God remembered Rachel [<i>et Raḥel</i>],” “Rachel” – by her merit; “<i>et </i>Rachel” – by the merit of her sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Leah also prayed on her behalf.</i> “God heeded her” – by the merit of Jacob; “and he opened” – by the merit of the matriarchs.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Leah, Bilha, and Zilpa.

The Rabbis said: It is because idol worship came into his possession and he did not nullify it, as it is stated: “And captured cities from him: Beit El and its environs” (II Chronicles 13:19), and it is written: “He placed one [golden calf] in Beit El…” (I Kings 12:29). The matters can be derived <i>a fortiori</i>: If a king, because he mistreated a king like him, was afflicted, a commoner who mistreats a commoner, all the more so.

<b>“The Lord said to Jacob: Return to the land of your fathers, and to your birthplace, and I will be with you” (Genesis 31:3).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Jacob: Return to the land of your fathers, and to your birthplace.” It is written: “I cried out to You, Lord, and said: You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living” (Psalms 142:6) – but is “the land of the living” not Tyre and its environs; there is plenty there, there are low prices there, and you say: “My portion in the land of the living”?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding Israel.</i> It is, rather, the land whose dead come to life first in the messianic era.

The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You said: “My portion in the land of the living.” “Return to the land of your fathers” – your father is awaiting you; your mother is awaiting you, I, Myself am awaiting you.’ <br>Rabbi Ami said in the name of Reish Lakish: Possessions outside of the Land of Israel, there is no blessing in them. But, ‘When you return to the land of your fathers, I will be with you.’ Elsewhere it says: “I have been with you wherever you have gone” (II Samuel 7:9). It is, rather, that David, because he led Israel, He would say to him: “I have been with you wherever you have gone.” But Jacob, because he led his family, he says to him: “Return to the land of your fathers…”

Whichever way you look at it, whether you agree or do not agree, it is already written: “He placed a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob” (Genesis 30:36), and it is written: “It was told to Laban on the third day” – the third day after the flight, as it is stated: “He took his brethren with him, and pursued him a distance of seven days” – on that same day.

Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina, and Rabbi Yisakhar of Kefar Mandi, Rabbi Ḥama said: The Holy One blessed be He appears to the prophets of the nations of the world only with truncated speech, just as it says: “God happened [<i>vayikar</i>] upon Bilam” (Numbers 23:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash views the word <i>vayikar</i> as a truncated version of the word <i>vayikra</i> – He called, which is typically employed regarding the prophets of Israel.</i> Rabbi Yisakhar of Kefar Mandi said: This expression <i>vayikar</i> is nothing other than an expression of impurity, just as it says: “If there will be among you a man who will not be pure due to an incident [<i>mikre</i>] at night” (Deuteronomy 23:11). But to the prophets of Israel [God speaks] with complete speech, with expressions of endearment, with expressions of sanctity, with expressions with which the ministering angels laud Him, as it is stated: “And this one called to that one and said: Holy…” (Isaiah 6:3). Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: The Holy One blessed be He appears to the prophets of the nations of the world only at a time that people typically take their leave from one another, as it is written: “In thoughts from visions of the night, when slumber falls on men” (Job 4:13), “a matter stealthily came to me…” (Job 4:12). Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Menaḥem said: “The Lord is far from the wicked” (Proverbs 15:29) – these are the prophets of the nations of the world; “and He hears the prayer of the righteous” (Proverbs 15:29) – these are the prophets of Israel. What distinguishes between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the idol worshippers? Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and Rabbi Simon, Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: [This is analogous] to a king and his friend who are together in a great hall. Whenever he wishes, he speaks with his friend. <An alternate version: This is analogous to a king and his friend in a great hall, with a curtain placed between them. Whenever he would seek to speak with his friend, he would draw the curtain and speak with his friend.> Rabbi Simon says: It is analogous to a king who has a wife and a concubine. When he comes to his wife, he comes publicly, but when he comes to his concubine, he comes clandestinely. So, the Holy One blessed be He appears to the idolaters only at night. “God came to Bilam at night” (Numbers 22:20). “God came to Avimelekh in a dream at night” (Genesis 20:3). “God came to Laban the Aramean in a night dream.”  <br>“He said to him: Beware” – even if you say it is for his benefit, he considers it for his detriment. “Beware of speaking with Jacob, good or bad.”

The combativeness of the patriarchs, from where is it derived? “Jacob was angry and quarreled with Laban. Jacob responded and said to Laban: What is my transgression, what is my sin that you have pursued?” Do you, perhaps, think that there would be blows or wounds there? There were, rather, words of appeasement, Jacob placated his father-in-law: “For you felt all my vessels, what have you found of all your household vessels?” Rabbi Simon said: In the way of the world, a son-in-law who resides with his father-in-law, is it possible for him not to benefit from even one vessel, even one knife? However, here, “you felt all my vessels” – you did not find even a needle, even a hook. And not the humility of the descendants, from David, as it is stated: “David fled from Nayot in Rama, and he came and said before Jonathan: What have I done? What is my iniquity and what is my sin before your father that he seeks my life?” (I Samuel 20:1). He mentions bloodshed in his words of appeasement, matters of murder; however, here, “that you have pursued me.”

I sought to attack them, but they produced their epistle: “Do not besiege Moav.”’ At that moment, David did not conduct himself with the requisite royal dignity. He removed his royal garment of purple wool and the crown from his head, wrapped himself in his cloak and went to the Sanhedrin. He said to them: ‘My masters: I came here only to teach.

Chapter 75

<b>“Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Se’ir, the field of Edom” (Genesis 32:4).</b> <br>“Jacob sent messengers before him” – Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Reuven began: “Arise, Lord, confront him and subdue him. Rescue me from the wicked with Your sword” (Psalms 17:13) – Rabbi Pinḥas said: Five times in the book of Psalms, David calls for the Holy One blessed be He to arise: “Arise, Lord; save me, my God” (Psalms 3:8); “Arise, Lord, in Your anger” (Psalms 7:7); “Arise, Lord God, raise Your hand. Do not forget” (Psalms 10:12); “Arise, Lord; let man not be arrogant” (Psalms 9:20); “Arise, Lord, confront him” (Psalms 17:13). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘David, my son, even if you call for Me to rise many times, I will not rise. When will I rise? It is when the poor are robbed and the indigent are groaning.’ That is what is written: “Because of the robbery of the poor and the groans of the indigent [now I will arise]” (Psalms 12:6).

“Jacob sent messengers before him” – Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon began: “Like a muddied spring and a ruined fount, [so is a righteous man who falls before the wicked]” (Proverbs 25:26). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Just as it is impossible for a spring to be muddied and for a fount to be ruined,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Because the water is flowing, any mud will ultimately be swept away.</i> so it is impossible for a righteous man to fall before the wicked.

He was going on his way, and then you are sending to him and saying: “So said your servant, Jacob.”
“Jacob sent” – Rav Huna began: “Like one who grasps the ears of a dog, so is a passerby who is angered over a quarrel not his” (Proverbs 26:17). Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is analogous to the head of the robbers, who was sleeping at a crossroads. One person passed and began waking him. He said to him: ‘Wake up, because evil is rampant here.’ He woke up and began beating him. He said: ‘Evil has awakened.’ He said to him: ‘I was asleep and you woke me.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘He was going on his way, and then you are sending to him and saying to him submissively: “So said your servant, Jacob.”’ <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon began: “What will you say when He will reckon with you, and you trained them as chieftains and heads over you?” (Jeremiah 13:21). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘He was going on his way, and then you are sending to him and saying: “So said your servant, Jacob.”’
“Messengers [<i>malakhim</i>]” – these were flesh and blood messengers. The Rabbis say: Actual angels. Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Hagar was Sarah’s maidservant and five angels happened upon her,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 16:7–12.</i> this one who is the beloved of the household, all the more so.

He is ruddy – “the first emerged ruddy” (Genesis 25:25); “his cooked food is red” – “feed me please from that red, red dish” (Genesis 25:30); “his land is red” – “to the land of Se’ir, the field of Edom”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Red, <i>adom</i>, is similar to <i>Edom</i>.

<b>“He commanded them, saying: So you shall say to my lord, to Esau: So says your servant Jacob: I have resided with Laban, and tarried until now” (Genesis 32:5).</b> <br>“He commanded them, saying: So you shall say to my lord, to Esau” – Rabbeinu [Yehuda HaNasi] said to Rabbi Appas: ‘Write one letter in my name to our master, Emperor Antoninus.’ He stood and wrote: From Yehuda the Prince to our master, Emperor Antoninus. He took it, read it, and ripped it. He said to him: ‘Write: From your servant Yehuda to our master, Emperor Antoninus.’ He said to him: ‘My teacher, why are you demeaning your honor?’ He said to him: ‘In what way am I better than my ancestors? Did he not say this: “So says your servant Jacob”?’ <br>“I have resided with Laban” – Laban, who is the master of the deceivers, I placed him up my sleeve;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I succeeded in overcoming his deceitfulness.</i> this man,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">You, Esau.</i> all the more so. Why did I reside with Laban and “I tarried until now”? It is because the adversary of that man [Esau] had not yet been born. But now, the adversary of that man has been born, as Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: There is a tradition that Esau will fall only into the hands of Rachel’s children. That is what is written: “Will the young of the flock not drag them?” (Jeremiah 49:20). Why does he call them “the young of the flock”? It is because they are the youngest of the tribes.
<b>“I have oxen and donkeys and flocks and slaves and maidservants, and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes” (Genesis 32:6).</b> <br>“I have oxen [<i>shor</i>] and donkeys [<i>vahamor</i>]…”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shor </i>and<i> Ḥamor</i> are singular nouns used to connote numerous oxen and donkeys.</i> – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda says: From one ox, many oxen emerged; from one donkey, many donkeys emerged. Rabbi Neḥemya said: In people’s vernacular they say ox, camel. The Rabbis say: “<i>Shor</i>”<i> </i>– that is the one anointed for war, as it is stated: “A firstborn bull [<i>shoro</i>] is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues: “With them he will gore the peoples together at the ends of the earth.”</i> “<i>Ḥamor</i>” – this is the messianic king, as it is stated: “He is humble, and riding upon a donkey [<i>ḥamor</i>]…” (Zechariah 9:9). “Flocks [<i>tzon</i>]” – this is Israel, as it is stated: “You, My flock [<i>tzoni</i>], flock of My pasture” (Ezekiel 34:31). “And slaves and maidservants [<i>ve’eved veshifḥa</i>]” – “Behold, as the eyes of slaves to the hand of their master, [as the eyes of a maidservant to the hand of her mistress]” (Psalms 123:2); “Be gracious to us, Lord; be gracious to us, for we have had more than enough of scorn” (Psalms 123:3).
<b>“The messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to your brother, to Esau; moreover he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him” (Genesis 32:7).</b> <br>“The messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to your brother, to Esau” – you treat him like a brother, but he treats you like Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">He wants to harm you, and does not relate to you as a brother.</i> <br>“Moreover he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him” – Reish Lakish said: “With him” – those who are with him are like him. Just as he is mighty and capable of standing against four hundred men, so, each and every one of them is capable of overcoming four hundred men. Rabbi Levi said: He went and took a license from Egypt to collect taxes. He said: ‘If I can overcome him, fine. If not, I will say to him: Pay taxes, and as a result, I will confront him and kill him.’
Another matter, “Jacob sent messengers” (Genesis 32:4) – this is what was said with divine spirit by Solomon king of Israel: “Blessings upon the head of the righteous, and villainy will cover the mouth of the wicked” (Proverbs 10:6). Corresponding to whom did Solomon state this verse? He said it corresponding only to Jacob and Esau. “Blessings upon the head of the righteous” – this is Jacob. “And villainy will cover the mouth of the wicked” – this is the wicked Esau. Happy are the righteous who are blessed on earth and are blessed in Heaven, and this is appropriate, as it is stated: “So that one who blesses himself in the land will bless himself by the God of faithfulness” (Isaiah 65:16) – to inform you that all the blessings that Isaac blessed Jacob, corresponding to those, the Holy One blessed be He blessed him from on High. Isaac said to him: “God will give you from the dew of the heavens…” (Genesis 27:28), and the Holy One blessed be He blessed him with dew and rain, as it is stated: “The remnant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew [from the Lord, like raindrops]” (Micah 5:6). Isaac said to him: “and from the fats of the earth” (Genesis 27:28), and the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “He will give rain for your seeds with which you will sow the ground” (Isaiah 30:23). Isaac said: “Peoples will serve you” (Genesis 27:29), and the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Kings will be your caregivers, and their princesses, your wet nurses” (Isaiah 49:23). Isaac said: “You will be a lord to your brethren” (Genesis 27:29), and the Holy One blessed be He said to him through Moses: “To place you uppermost over all the nations” (Deuteronomy 26:19). You learned that all the blessings that Isaac blessed Jacob from below, corresponding to that, the Holy One blessed be He blessed him from on High. <br>His mother Rebecca, too, blessed him corresponding to them, as it is stated: “He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High” (Psalms 91:1). So she said to him: “For He will charge His angels on your behalf [to guard you in all your ways]” (Psalms 91:11). When she said that to him in that language, the Divine Spirit blessed Him: “When he calls upon Me, I will answer him…” (Psalms 91:15). Once the Holy One blessed be He blessed him, why did his father bless him again, as it is stated: “Isaac summoned Jacob, and he blessed him”? (Genesis 28:1). It is, rather, that Isaac saw through the divine spirit that his descendants were destined to be exiled among the nations. He said to him: ‘Come and I will bless you blessings of exile, so that the Holy One blessed be He will return to you and gather you from the midst of the exiles.’ What are the blessings? “In six troubles He will deliver you, and in seven, no harm will touch you. …From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden, and you will not fear pillage when it comes. At pillage and hunger you will laugh, and from the beasts of the earth, do not fear” (Job 5:19, 21–22). That is why it is stated: “Blessings upon the head of the righteous.”
Another matter, “Jacob sent” (Genesis 32: 4) – “Lord, do not grant the desires of the wicked. Do not bring their scheme to fruition [<i>zemamo al tafek</i>]; may they depart, Selah” (Psalms 140:9). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, do not realize for wicked Esau the thoughts of his heart.’ What is “<i>zemamo al tafek</i>”? He said before him: ‘Master of the universe: Place a muzzle for wicked Esau so that his satisfaction will not be complete.’ What muzzle did the Holy One blessed be He make for wicked Esau? Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: ‘These are the residents of Barbary and the residents of Germany, whom the Edomites<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to Rome, which was being attacked by Germanic tribes.</i> fear.’ <br>Another matter, “do not grant the desires of the wicked” – he said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, just as it was Laban’s intent to harm me, but you did not allow him to do so, so, too, regarding the thoughts of my brother Esau who is thinking to kill me, thwart his evil.’ He was one of three people who thought [to do] evil, but they were unsuccessful – Esau, Yerovam, and Haman. Esau, as it is stated: “Esau said in his heart” (Genesis 27:41). Regarding Yerovam it is written: “Yerovam said in his heart” (I Kings 12:26). Regarding Haman it is written: “Haman said in his heart” (Esther 6:6). <br>What is “Esau said in his heart”? He said: ‘Cain killed his brother, and the Omnipresent did nothing to him. Ultimately, he [Adam] begot additional sons, and they inherited the world with him. But I, I will kill Isaac my father first, and then I will kill Jacob my brother, and I will inherit the world alone,’ as it is stated: “Let the days of mourning for my father approach” (Genesis 27:41) – he said: ‘First, I will hasten the mourning for Father, and then: “I will kill my brother Jacob”’ (Genesis 27:41). But the Holy One blessed be He did not enable him to do so. That is why it is stated: “Do not grant the desires of the wicked.”
Another matter, “Jacob sent messengers” (Genesis 32:4) – come and see what is written before this matter: “Jacob said, when he saw them: [This is the camp of God]” (Genesis 32:3). How many were in a camp of God? Two thousand myriads of ministering angels, as it is stated: “The chariots of God are myriad, thousands upon thousands of companies. My Lord is among them, at Sinai, in holiness” (Psalms 68:18). “He called the name of that place Maḥanayim” (Genesis 32:3). Why were there two camps? It teaches that they gave Jacob four thousand myriads of ministering angels and they appeared to him like a king’s armies, some of whom were clad in iron, some of whom were on horseback, and some of whom were sitting in chariots. He [Esau] encountered those clad in iron. He said to them: ‘With whom are you affiliated?’ They said to him: ‘With Jacob.’ He encountered those on horseback. He said to them: ‘With whom are you affiliated?’ They said to him: ‘With Jacob.’ He encountered those in chariots. He said to them: ‘With whom are you affiliated?’ They said to him: ‘With Jacob,’ as it is stated: “He said: For whom do you intend this entire camp that I met?” (Genesis 33:8). Jacob, too, would mention to Esau the name of the Holy One blessed be He, to scare him and to frighten him, as it is stated: “As I have seen your face, as the sight of the face of angels [<i>elohim</i>]” (Genesis 33:10). To what is this matter analogous? It is to one who invited another to a meal, and he<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The guest.</i> ascertained that he sought to kill him. He [the guest] said: ‘The taste of this dish is like the taste of a dish that I tasted in the king’s palace.’ He said: ‘He knows the king?’ He was afraid and did not kill him. The same is true of Jacob. When he said to Esau: “As I have seen your face, as the sight of the face of angels [<i>elohim</i>]” wicked Esau said: ‘The Holy One blessed be He brought him to all this glory? I will no longer be able to overcome him.’
Another matter, “Jacob sent messengers” (Genesis 32:4) – why did he send messengers to him? Rather, this is what he said: ‘I will send him messengers; maybe he will repent.’ He said to them: ‘Say to him: Do not say Jacob remains as he was when he departed from his father’s house, as it is stated: “For with my staff I crossed…” (Genesis 32:11), “He commanded him, saying” (Genesis 32:5) – say to him: Do not say that when he departed from you he took anything from the household property. Rather, [tell him that] I acquired all these as my wages, through my effort,’ as it is stated: “And now I have become two camps” (Genesis 32:11). <br>At the moment that Jacob called Esau “my lord,” the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You abased yourself and called him “my lord” eight times. As you live, I will establish eight kings from his descendants before your descendants,’ as it is stated: “These are the kings who reigned [in the land of Edom, before the reign of a king for the children of Israel]” (Genesis 36:31).  <br>He [Jacob] said to them [the messengers]: ‘Say to him: If you are prepared for peace, I am with you, and if for war, I am with you. I have warriors, courageous and strong, who say something before the Holy One blessed be He, and He performs their will on their behalf,’ as it is stated: “He performs the will of those who fear him” (Psalms 145:19). That is why David came to give praise and acclaim before the Holy One blessed be He, who helped him when he fled from Saul, as it is stated: “For behold, the wicked bend the bow” (Psalms 11:2). What is written thereafter? “If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous man do?” (Psalms 11:3). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, if You had distanced and forsook Jacob, who is the pillar and foundation of the world, as it is stated: “The righteous man is the foundation of the world” (Proverbs 10:25), “what can the righteous man do?”’ Regarding that moment, it is stated: “Some on chariots and some on horses, but we invoke the name of the Lord our God” (Psalms 20:8).
Another matter, “I have oxen [<i>shor</i>], and donkeys [<i>vaḥamor</i>]” (Genesis 32:6). <i>Shor</i> – this is Joseph, as it is stated: “A firstborn bull [<i>shoro</i>] is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17). <i>Vaḥamor</i> – this is Issachar, as it is written: “Issachar is a strong-boned donkey [<i>ḥamor</i>] (Genesis 49:14). Joseph’s grandson is destined to eradicate Amalek, as it is stated: “Joshua<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua was from the tribe of Ephraim, who was Joseph's son.</i> weakened Amalek and its people by sword” (Exodus 17:13). Issachar’s descendants know what the Holy One blessed be He does in His world, as it is stated: “From the children of Issachar, possessors of understanding of the times, to know what Israel should do; their leaders were two hundred” (I Chronicles 12:33). “Flocks [<i>tzon</i>]” – this is Israel, as it is stated: “You, My flock [<i>tzoni</i>], flock of My pasture, you are man” (Ezekiel 34:31). “And slaves [<i>ve’eved</i>]” – this is David, as it is stated: “I am your servant [<i>avdekha</i>] son of your maidservant” (Psalms 116:16). “And maidservants [<i>veshifḥa</i>]” – this is Avigayil, as it is stated: “Here is your handmaiden as a maidservant [<i>leshifḥa</i>]” (I Samuel 25:41). <br><b>“Jacob was very frightened and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the cattle, and the camels, into two camps” (Genesis 32:8).</b> <br>At that moment, those messengers went to Esau and saw armed warriors with him, and they came and told Jacob, as it is stated: “The messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to your brother, to Esau” (Genesis 32:7). What is: “And four hundred men with him”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Four hundred kings wearing crowns. Some say: Four hundred prefects were with him. Rabbi Yanai said: Four hundred generals were with him. When they related to Jacob all that multitude, he was afraid and he divided his wives and children into two camps, as it is stated: “He divided the people who were with him…[into two camps].”
<b>“He said: If Esau will come upon the one camp, and smite it, the remaining camp will escape” (Genesis 32:9). <br>“And Jacob said: the Lord of my father Abraham, and the Lord of my father Isaac, God who told me: Go back to your land and your birthright, and I will benefit you" (Genesis 32:10). <br>“Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, mother, and children, alike” (Genesis 32:12).</b> <br>“He said: If Esau will come upon the one camp, and smite it” – at that moment, our patriarch Jacob said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, it is written in Your Torah: “A bull or a sheep, it and its offspring you shall not slaughter on one day” (Leviticus 22:28). If this wicked one comes and eradicates my children and their mothers as one, the Torah scroll that You are destined to give on Mount Sinai, who will read it? I implore You, deliver me from his hand, “lest he come and smite me mother and children alike,”’ as it is stated: “Deliver me, please.”  <br><b>“And Jacob slept there on that night, and he took from what he had as a present for his brother Esau” (Genesis 32:14).</b> <br>What did he [Jacob] do? He arose and sent him a gift in order to blind his eyes, as it is stated: “As the bribe will blind the eyes of the wise” (Deuteronomy 16:19), and the wise are none other than Edomites, as it is stated: “I will eliminate the wise from Edom and understanding from the mountain of Esau” (Obadiah 1:8). <br><b>“Two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams” (Genesis 32:15). <br>“Nursing camels and their offspring thirty, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys” (Genesis 32:16). <br>“He placed them in the charge of his servants, each drove by itself; he said to his servants: Go ahead of me, and maintain a distance between one drove and the other drove” (Genesis 32:17).</b> <br>“He placed them in the charge of his servants, each drove by itself.” What is: “Maintain a distance”? Jacob said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, if troubles will befall my descendants, do not bring them one after another, but rather, create distance for them between their troubles.’ <br>At that moment, Jacob lifted his eyes sand saw that Esau was coming from afar, and he directed his eyes heavenward, wept, and requested mercy from before the Holy One blessed be He. He heard his prayer and promised him that he would deliver him<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Him and his descendants.</i> from all his troubles due to Jacob’s merit, as it is stated: “The Lord will answer you at a time of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob will fortify you” (Psalms 20:2).

Chapter 76

<b>“Jacob was very frightened and distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the cattle, and the camels, into two camps” (Genesis 32:8).</b> <br>“Jacob was very frightened and distressed” – Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Reuven: The Holy One blessed be He made a promise to two people, but they were afraid; the chosen of the patriarchs, and the chosen of the prophets. The chosen of the patriarchs – this is Jacob, as it is stated: “For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself” (Psalms 135:4). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Behold, I am with you” (Genesis 28:15), but ultimately he was afraid, as it is stated: “Jacob was…frightened.” The chosen of the prophets – this is Moses, as it is stated; “Were it not for Moses, His chosen” (Psalms 106:23). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “For I will be with you” (Exodus 3:12), but ultimately, he was afraid: “The Lord said to Moses: Do not fear him” (Numbers 21:34). He says: ‘Do not fear’ only to one who is afraid. <br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Ḥelbo in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rabbi Natan: Israel would have been worthy of elimination in the days of Haman, had they not based their mindset on the mindset of their ancestor.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash states that in the days of Haman, the Jews should not have been terrified, since they had already been given a Divine promise that the Jewish people would not be eliminated. However, since this mindset of fearing annihilation despite a Divine promise existed already, with Jacob, it was forgiveable.</i> They said: ‘If our patriarch Jacob, to whom the Holy One blessed be He promised and said: “Behold, I am with you,” (Genesis 28:15) was afraid, we, all the more so.’ That is what the prophet criticizes Israel: “You forgot the Lord your Maker, who spread the heavens and laid the foundation of the earth” (Isaiah 51:13). He said to them: ‘You have forgotten what He said to you: “So said the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured [and the foundations of the earth below probed, I too will spurn all the descendants of Israel because of everything that they did]” (Jeremiah 31:36) – if you see the heavens fall and the earth collapse.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the heavens cannot be measured and the foundations of the earth probed, so I will never spurn you.</i> Should you not have learned from the spread of the heavens and the earth?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">You should have learned from the fact that the heaven and earth did not collapse, but rather, the heavens remained spread over the earth.</i> Instead, “you feared continuously all day”’ (Isaiah 51:13).
Another matter, “Jacob was very frightened and distressed” – Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: The fright and the distress are not the same.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It would have been enough to write one of them. One who fears, is in distress.</i> Rather, he was frightened lest he kill, and distressed lest he be killed. He said: ‘If he overcomes me, he will kill me, and if I overcome him, I will kill him.’ That is: He was frightened lest he kill, and distressed lest he be killed. He said: ‘All these years, he [Esau] has been residing in the Land of Israel; say that he comes against me<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Maybe he will be able to overcome me.</i> by virtue of his residence in the Land of Israel. All these years, he has been residing and honoring his parents; say that he comes against me by virtue of his honoring father and mother, as so he said: “The days of mourning for my father will approach” (Genesis 27:41). Say that this old man died and he will come against me to kill me.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is another explanation for the distress of Jacob. The fear was of Esau, the distress was from the thought that maybe his father had died.</i> <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: This is what the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Return to the land of your fathers, to the land of your birth” (Genesis 31:3). Say that the stipulations<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The stipulations that Jacob made when he departed for Padan Aram. See Genesis 28:20–22.</i> were until here: “And He will protect me on this path” (Genesis 28:20), and not beyond that.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Maybe the promise for protection ended when he reached the land of his fathers.</i> Rabbi Yudan said: The Omnipresent said to him: “Return to the land of your fathers,” but nevertheless, “Jacob was very frightened”? Rather, from here [we learn] that there is no promise to the righteous in this world.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Promises made are conditional on righteous behavior, thus the righteous may fear that they have sinned in such a way that they have lost the guarantee of protection that they received (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: “Behold, I am with you” (Genesis 28:15); “if God will be with me”? (Genesis 28:20). Rather, from here [we learn] that there is no promise to the righteous in this world. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: “He said: For I will be with you” (Exodus 3:12) and nothing evil will harm you,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is implied by the fact that God said that He would be with Moses.</i> and it is written: “It was on the way, in the lodging, [the Lord encountered him and sought to kill him]” (Exodus 4:24). Rather, there is no promise to the righteous in this world.  <br>Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori: “Benayahu son of Yehoyada answered the king and said: “Amen; and so may the Lord, God of my lord the king, say” (I Kings 1:36).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This was said in responsed to David's decree to anoint Solomon as king.</i> But is it not already stated: “Behold, a son is born to you, he will be a man of rest” (I Chronicles 22:9)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The son mentioned in the verse is Solomon.</i> – rather, he said: ‘Many adversaries may arise from here to Giḥon.’
“He divided the people” – the Torah taught you proper conduct; that a person should not place all his property in one corner. From whom do you learn this? It is from Jacob, as it is stated: “He divided the people…” Likewise it says: “And hid them, fifty men to a cave” (I Kings 18:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ovadya hid one hundred prophets from Jezebel, fifty in each of two caves, rather than all together in one cave.</i> <br><b>“He said: If Esau will come upon the one camp, and smite it, the remaining camp will survive” (Genesis 32:9).</b> <br>“He said: If Esau will come upon the one camp, and smite it” – these are our brethren in the south;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Land of Israel.</i> “the remaining camp will survive” – these are our brethren in the Diaspora. Rabbi Hoshaya said: Even though they survived, they fast on our behalf on Monday and Thursday.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Even though they are not being threatened, they fast and pray on their behalf.</i>
<b>“Jacob said: God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, Lord, who says to me: Return to your land, and to the land of your birth, and I will benefit you” (Genesis 32:10).</b> <br>“Jacob said: God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac” – but not of Esau? It is, rather, that [God says:] ‘One who chooses their path and performs actions like theirs, I affirm My presence over him; one who does not choose their path and does not perform actions like theirs, I do not affirm My presence over him.’ <br>Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Who was close to David; was it not Aḥaz? But he leaves Aḥaz and says to Hezekiah: “So said the Lord, God of David, your father” (II Kings 20:5). It is, rather, that [God says:] ‘One who chooses their path and performs actions like theirs, I affirm My presence over him; one who does not choose their path and does not perform actions like theirs, I do not affirm My presence over him.’
<b>“I am unworthy of all the kindnesses and of all the truth that You have performed for Your servant, for with my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps” (Genesis 32:11).</b> <br>“I am unworthy of all the kindnesses” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: I am “unworthy.” Rabbi Levi said: ‘I am worthy, but [I have become] “unworthy” due to [“all the kindnesses.”]’ <br>“For with my staff I crossed this Jordan” – Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said, in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: In the Torah, in the Prophets, and in the Writings, we have found that Israel crossed the Jordan only due to the merit of Jacob. In the Torah – “for with my staff I crossed this Jordan.” In the Prophets – “You shall inform your children, saying: Israel crossed this Jordan on dry land” (Joshua 4:22) – Israel the elder. In the Writings – “What is it, sea, that makes you flee? The Jordan, that you turn back?…from before the God of Jacob” (Psalms 114:5, 7). <br>There is a place called Jordan in the hot springs of Tiberias. Our patriarch Jacob entered there, panic-stricken, and Esau shut him in there. The Holy One blessed be He dug an opening in another place and he emerged. That is what is written: “When you pass through the water, I am with you, and through the rivers, they will not inundate you” (Isaiah 43:2).
<b>“Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, mother and children alike” (Genesis 32:12).</b> <br>“Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau” – deliver my future descendants from the hand of his descendants, who come with the power of Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The power of Esau is the sword – “by your sword you shall live” (Genesis 27:40).</i> That is what is written: “I was looking at the horns, and behold, another, small horn arose among them” (Daniel 7:8) – that is the son of Netzer.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A robber who conquered provinces on the Roman–Persian border and ruled there under the auspices of Rome.</i> “And three of the original horns were uprooted from before it” (Daniel 7:8) – this is that they gave them their kingdom; Macrinus, Carinus, and Kyriades.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">These were the provinces.</i> “Behold, there were eyes like the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking arrogantly” (Daniel 7:8) – this is the evil empire that imposes levies upon all the nations of the world.

Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: It was Esau’s guardian angel.

He lifted his eyes, saw the king standing over him, and cast himself down before him. That is what is written: “He saw that he could not prevail against him” – He saw in the Divine Presence that he could not prevail over him. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: We do not know who was victorious, whether it was the angel or Jacob, but from what is written in the verse: “A man wrestled [<i>vaye’avek</i>] with him” – that is, who became covered with dust [<i>avak</i>]; the man who was with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Since the man who was with him became covered with dust, that indicates that Jacob was victorious.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: The Holy One blessed be He said to him [to the angel]: 'He comes against you with five amulets in his possession: His merit, his father’s merit, his mother’s merit, his grandfather’s merit, and his grandmother’s merit.

From what is written: “For He will charge His angels on your behalf to guard you” (Psalms 91:11) – that is, the guarded is greater than the guard. Rabbi Yehuda says: Who is greater, the carrier or the carried? From what is written: “They will carry you on their palms” (Psalms 91:12) – that is, the carried is greater than the carrier. Rabbi Shimon said: From what is written: “He said: Release me” – that is, the one releasing is greater than the one released.
“He said: ‘Release me” – as the time for my lauding, to laud the Holy One blessed be He has arrived.’ He said to him: ‘Let your colleagues laud Him.’ He said to him: ‘I cannot, as the next day I will come to laud, and they will say to me, just as you did not laud yesterday, so you will not laud today.’ He [Jacob] said: ‘If you complete your task, you receive your reward – “I will not release you unless you bless me.”’ He [Jacob] said to him: ‘Those angels who came to Abraham, they took their leave from him only with a blessing.’ He said to him: ‘They were sent only for that purpose, but I was not sent for that purpose.’ He said to him: ‘If you complete your task, you receive your reward’ – “I will not release you.” <br>Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: He [the angel] said: ‘The ministering angels, because they revealed the secrets of the Holy One blessed be He,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">They revealed to Lot that the city of Sodom was going to be destroyed.</i> they were banished from their partition for one hundred and thirty-eight years.

That is what is written: “God said to him: Your name is Jacob; [your name shall no longer be called Jacob]” (Genesis 35:10) – “no [more] shall Jacob be said.” <br>Bar Kappara said: Anyone who calls Abraham Abram violates a positive commandment.

It is taught: It is not that the name of Jacob will be uprooted. Rather, “but Israel shall be your name” (Genesis 35:10) – Israel will be primary and Jacob secondary. Rabbi Zechariah in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: In any case: Your name is Jacob… “but Israel shall be your name” (Genesis 35:10) – Jacob is primary, and Israel is in addition to it.  <br>“For you have striven with God and with men, and you have prevailed” – you have wrestled with the heavenly and prevailed over them, and with the earthly and prevailed over them. With the heavenly – this is the angel. Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: He was Esau’s ministering angel. This is what he said to him: “For therefore, I have seen your face, as the sight of the face of angels [<i>penei elohim</i>]” (Genesis 33:10).

<b>“The sun rose for him as he passed Penuel, and he was limping from his hip” (Genesis 32:32).</b> <br>“The sun rose for him…” – Rabbi Berekhya said: For whom did the sun not rise?

The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You are a paradigm for your descendants. Just as you, the sun was healing you and beating down on Esau and his chieftains, so, your descendants, the sun will heal them and beat down on the idolaters.

<b>“Jacob lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men.

They said: ‘What is this?’ It said to them: ‘I forgot one hundred.’ They said to it: ‘We will suffice even with two hundred.’ It walked a bit and stopped. They said: ‘What is this?’ It said to them: ‘I forgot one hundred more.’ They said to it: ‘We will suffice even with one hundred.’ When they reached there, it said: ‘I forgot them all. Instead, let each and every one placate for itself.’ So, Jacob our patriarch; Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: [Initially Jacob said] I have the ability to pray.

<b>“He placed the maidservants and their children first, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last” (Genesis 33:2).</b> <br>“He placed the maidservants and their children first” – this is to say: The farther back one is, the more he is beloved. <br><b>“He passed before them and prostrated himself earthward seven times, until he reached his brother” (Genesis 33:3).</b> <br>“He passed before them” – that is what is written: “As a father has mercy upon his son” (Psalms 103:13).

He [Jacob] said to him [Esau]: ‘May you consider yourself as though you are situated behind seven partitions and sitting and judging, and I am being judged before you, and you are filled with mercy upon me.’ <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: He did not cease prostrating and progressing, prostrating and progressing, until he introduced the attribute of justice into the attribute of mercy.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">So that the attribute of justice would be subjected to the attribute of mercy. <br></i>

Rather, it teaches that at that moment he was overcome with mercy and he kissed him with all his heart. Rabbi Yannai said to him: If so, why is it dotted over it? Rather, it teaches that he did not come to kiss him, but rather to bite him, and Jacob’s neck was transformed into marble and the teeth of that wicked one were blunted. Why does the verse state: “And they wept”? It is, rather, that this one wept over his neck, and that one wept over his teeth.

<b>“Jacob arrived intact to the city of Shekhem, which is in the land of Canaan, upon his arrival from Padan Aram, and he encamped before the city” (Genesis 33:18).</b> <br>“Jacob arrived intact.” “In six troubles He will deliver you, and in seven, no harm will touch you” (Job 5:19); if they are six, I will withstand them, if they are seven, I will withstand them. “In famine, He redeems you from death” (Job 5:20) – “For these two years the famine is in the midst of the land” (Genesis 45:6). “And in war, from the sword” (Job 5:20) – “It is in my power to do you harm” (Genesis 31:29). “From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden” (Job 5:21) – Rav Aḥa said: Evil speech is so egregious that the One who created it created a place in which it could be hidden. “And you will not fear pillage when it comes” (Job 5:21) – this is Esau and his chieftains. “At pillage and hunger you will laugh” (Job 5:22) – this is Laban, who came hungry for his [Jacob’s] wealth, to rob him. “For your covenant will be with the rocks of the field…” (Job 5:23) – “he took one of the stones from the place, and placed it beneath his head” (Genesis 28:11). “You will know that your tent is at peace” (Job 5:24) – the incident of Reuben and Bilha,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 35:22.</i> the incident<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 38:1–30.</i> of Judah and Tamar.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sifrei Devarim</i> ch. 31 which states that God told Jacob that Reuben had repented. In the case of Judah and Tamar, it is explicit in the verse that Judah admitted that he was at fault. Thus, despite the falls, Jacob's tent remained at peace (see the <i>Peirush</i> <i>Maharzu </i>on the midrash here).</i> “When you visit your abode, you will not be lacking” (Job 5:24) – our patriarch Jacob was eighty-four years old and had never seen a drop of seminal emission.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Even unintentionally.</i> “You shall know also that your descendants will be many, and your offspring like the grass of the earth” (Job 5:25) – Rabbi Yudan said: Our patriarch Jacob did not pass from the world until he saw six hundred thousand of his sons’ descendants. “You will come to the grave at the right time [<i>bakelaḥ</i>], like a grain pile at its time” (Job 5:26). Rabbi Yitzḥak and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yitzḥak said: You will come moist [<i>laḥ</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This means full of vitality.</i> to your grave. The Rabbis say: You will come complete [<i>bekhola</i>] to the grave, full, lacking nothing, as it is stated: “Jacob arrived intact.”
“Jacob arrived intact.” “A song of ascents.

“If you are pure and upright…He will restore the abode of your righteousness” (Job 8:6). “If you are pure and upright” – “if you were” is not written here, but rather, “you are.” But in the past, he was not a righteous man. “He will rouse Himself for you” (Job 8:6) – the Holy One blessed be He is destined to be roused in your regard, and reward you for all the acts of righteousness that you performed. Because it is written: “But Jacob was a simple man, abiding in tents” (Genesis 25:27); therefore: “Jacob arrived intact.” <br>Rabbi Berekhya began: “You will decree, and He will fulfill it for you, and light will shine upon your ways” (Job 22:28). “You will decree, and He will fulfill it for you” – this is Jacob. “And light will shine upon your ways” – light will shine upon your two journeys.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The journey to Haran, and the journey back.</i> Because it is written: “If God will be with me…” (Genesis 28:20); “and behold I am with you, and will keep you” (Genesis 28:15): “and I return to my father’s house in peace” (Genesis 28:21), and it is written: “Jacob arrived intact.”
“Jacob arrived intact.” It is written: “Those who sow in tears, reap with joyous song” (Psalms 126:5). “Those who sow in tears” – this is our patriarch Jacob, who sowed the blessings in tears: “Perhaps my father will feel me” (Genesis 27:12). “Reap with joyous song” – “God will give you from the dew of the heavens and from the fat of the earth” (Genesis 27:28). “Though he walks weeping” (Psalms 126:6) – “he raised his voice and wept” (Genesis 29:11). “Bearing his sack of seed” (Psalms 126:6) – as he is drawn to the place that he is destined to procreate from there, as it is written: “Take a wife for you from there” (Genesis 28:2), “Isaac sent Jacob and he went to Padan Aram; to Laban, son of Betuel” (Genesis 28:5). “He returns in joyous song, bearing his sheaves [<i>alumotav</i>]” (Psalms 126:6) – he came bearing young men [<i>uleimin</i>] and young women [<i>ve’uleimita</i>].
“Jacob arrived intact” – intact in his body. Because it is written: “He was limping because of his hip” (Genesis 32:32); nevertheless, intact in his body. Intact in his children; because it is written in his regard: “If Esau will come upon the one camp, and smite it, the remaining camp will survive” (Genesis 32:9); nevertheless, here, intact in his children. Intact in his wealth; although, Rabbi Avun said in the name of Rav Aḥa: Our patriarch Jacob would give Esau that same gift<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 32:14–16.</i> for nine years; nevertheless, here, intact in his wealth. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Intact in his studies, but Joseph forgot, as it is stated: “As God has made me forget all my toil” (Genesis 41:51).

They would eat withered carobs until they broke out in sores. After thirteen years, he [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai] emerged and sat at the cave entrance. He saw a certain hunter standing and hunting birds. When Rabbi Shimon would hear a Divine Voice from Heaven: ‘Freedom, freedom,’ it would escape. But when he would hear a Divine Voice saying: ‘Killing,’ it would be hunted and trapped. He said: ‘Were it not for Heaven, a bird would not be hunted; the soul of a person, all the more so.’ He went out and found that matters were calm, and that the edict<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The edict that Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai should be killed.</i> had been abrogated. They came and bathed in that heated bathhouse in Tiberias. His son said to him: ‘Tiberias has afforded us so much benefit, and we are not purifying it from the dead?’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">There were areas of Tiberias in which priests could not go because there unidentified graves there.

He took a mandrake. He would cut the mandrake, cast the cuttings, and scatter them in the street. Every place where there was a corpse, it would rise, and they would move it and take it out of the city. And every place where there was no impurity, the mandrake would remain, and it would indicate which was a place of purity and which was a place of impurity until the time that they purified it from all the corpses. A certain Samaritan ignoramus saw him and said: ‘Will I not go and mock this Jewish elder?’ Some say it was in the wicker basket market, and some said it was the sack market. He took a corpse and concealed it in one of the streets that had been purified. In the morning, he went and said to them: ‘You said that ben Yoḥai had purified Tiberias. Come and see this corpse.’ <Variant reading: He went to him, he said to him: ‘Did you not purify such and such street?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘And if I produce corpses after you?’ He said to him: ‘Pull and show it.’>  <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai saw through the Divine spirit that he placed it there.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">That the Samaritan had placed the corpse there.</i> He said: ‘I decree that the one who is above shall descend, and the one who is below shall ascend,’ and so it was.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Samaritan who was above died and descended to the grave, and the corpse that he had buried came to life and rose from the grave.</i> He<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai.</i> ascended and sat in his house.

You breached the fence of the Sages, and in your regard it is written: “One who breaches a fence, a serpent will bite him”’ (Ecclesiastes 10:8). He [Nakai the scribe] immediately became a pile of bones. <br>He [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai] passed in the Beit Nekofa Valley.

He said to him: ‘And does he know anything of matters of Torah?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ ‘Has he received the Oral Law?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ ‘If I ask him, will he respond?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ ‘If so, let him ascend to here,’ and he ascended to there. He [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi II] said to him: ‘What is what is written: “Behold, all who cite proverbs will cite this proverb about you, saying: Like the mother is her daughter”?’ He said to him: ‘Like the daughter, so is her mother; like the generation, so is the <i>nasi</i>; like the altar, so are its priests. Here they say: According to the garden, the gardener.’ Reish Lakish said to him: ‘Until now I have not finished placating him over that one, and now you are bringing another upon us?’ [Reish Lakish said to Yosei of Maon ]‘What is the essence of: “Behold, all who cite proverbs”?’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">What is the literal explanation of the phrase that the daughter is like the mother? </i> He [Yosei of Maon] said to him: ‘There is no cow that is prone to gore that does not have a calf that kicks. There is no woman who engages in promiscuity that does not have a daughter who engages in promiscuity.’ They said to him: ‘If so, Leah our matriarch was a harlot?’ He said to them: ‘“Leah came out to meet him…” (Genesis 30:16) – she came out adorned like a harlot.’ That is why, “Dina, daughter of Leah…went out.”'
“Like troops of robbers waylay a man, a company of priests murders its way to Shekhem, for they have formulated a plot” (Hosea 6:9). Just as these robbers sit on the way, kill people, and take their wealth, so, Simeon and Levi did to Shekhem. But, like “a company of priests”? I wonder. Just as these priests join together at the threshing floor to take their portion, so Simeon and Levi did in Shekhem, as it is stated: “Murders its way to Shekhem” – it was proper for Simeon and Levi to have killed in Shekhem. “Shall [he render our sister] a harlot?” (Genesis 34:31) – they said: ‘What, will they treat us as worthless people?’ Who caused it? “Dina, daughter of Leah…went out.”
“The thistle that was in the Lebanon sent to the cedar” (II Kings 14:9). “The thistle that was in the Lebanon” – this is Ḥamor, father of Shekhem; “sent to the cedar” – this is Jacob. “Give your daughter to my son as a wife” (II Kings 14:9) – “The soul of my son Shekhem longs for your daughter. [Please, give her to him as a wife]” (Genesis 34:8). But the beasts of the field…passed and trampled” (II Kings 14:9) – “They killed Ḥamor and Shekhem his son by the sword” (Genesis 34:26). Who caused it? “Dina, daughter of Leah…went out.”
Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon began: “Do not glory in tomorrow [<i>leyom maḥar</i>][for you do not know what the day will bring]” (Proverbs 27:1), but you say: “My honesty shall speak on my behalf on a future day [<i>beyom maḥar</i>]”? (Genesis 30:33). In the future, your daughter will go out and be violated.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Namely, you cannot be certain of what will happen in the future.</i> That is what is written: “Dina…went out.” <br>Rabbi Ḥanina in the name of Rabbi Abba HaKohen ben Rabbi Eliezer began: “For the sake of one who deprives his neighbor of kindness” (Job 6:14) – you withheld kindness from your brother,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob hid Dina away from Esau when they met, not allowing him to see her and ask for her hand in marriage.

You did not seek to marry her in a permitted fashion, so she married in a prohibited fashion. “Dina…went out.”
Rabbi Tanḥuma began: “One man out of one thousand I have found, but a woman among all these I did not find” (Ecclesiastes 7:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>Yefe Toar</i> explains that this comes to explain how it is possible to say that there was something improper in Leah's behavior, as mentioned by Reish Lakish above in paragraph 1.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua in the name of Rabbi Levi began: “You neglect all my counsel” (Proverbs 1:25) – that is what is written: “The Lord God built [<i>vayiven</i>] the side” (Genesis 2:22). <i>Vayiven </i>– he observed from where to create her…<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba </i>18:2 for the entire statement of Rabbi Yehoshua in the name of Rabbi Levi.

When he revealed it, a bird swooped down and snatched it. So, “Dina, daughter of Leah…went out.” Immediately, “Shekhem, son of Ḥamor…saw her.” Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: She exposed her forearm.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When it says that Shekhem saw her, it was only her forearm, and no other concealed part of her body.</i> <br>“And lay with her, and violated her.” “And lay with her” – in the typical manner; “and violated her” – in an atypical manner.
<b>“And his soul cleaved to Dina the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman, and spoke comfortingly to the young woman” (Genesis 34:3). <br>“And Shekhem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying: Take me this girl for a wife” (Genesis 34:4). <br>“Jacob heard that he had defiled Dina his daughter, and his sons were with his livestock in the field, and Jacob kept silent until their arrival” (Genesis 34:5).</b> <br>“Jacob heard that he had defiled Dina his daughter…and Jacob kept silent” – that is what is written: “But a man of understanding will be silent” (Proverbs 11:12). <br><b>“And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard, the men were saddened, and they became very angry, as he performed a depravity to Israel to lie with Jacob's daughter, and so should not be done” (Genesis 34:7).</b> <br>“The sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard” – Isi ben Yehuda said: Four verses have no resolution,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear whether the words in the verses under discussion is the last word of the previous phrase, or the first word of the subsequent phrase.

Rabbi Tanḥuma adds this one: “The sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard,” or: “when they heard, the men were saddened.” <br>“And so should not be done” – even among the nations of the world, as from the moment that the world was stricken in the generation of the Flood, they stood and fenced themselves away from licentiousness.
<b>“Ḥamor spoke with them, saying: The soul of my son Shekhem desires your daughter. Please, give her to him as a wife” (Genesis 34:8).</b> <br>“Ḥamor spoke with them, saying” – Reish Lakish said: With three expressions of fondness, the Holy One blessed be He expressed His fondness for Israel: With cleaving, with desiring, and with wanting. With cleaving – “but you who cleave [to the Lord…]” (Deuteronomy 4:4). With desiring – “It is not for your multitude that the Lord desired [you]” (Deuteronomy 7:7). With wanting – “All the nations will praise you, [as you will be a wanted land]” (Malachi 3:12). And we learn it from the portion of this wicked one: With cleaving – “his soul cleaved [to Dina daughter of Jacob]” (Genesis 34:3). With desiring – “The soul of my son Shekhem desires your daughter” (Genesis 34:8). With wanting – “because he wanted Jacob’s daughter” (Genesis 34:19).  <br>Rabbi Abba bar Elisha adds two more: With love and with speech. With love – “I have loved you” (Malachi 1:2). With speech – “speak to the heart of Jerusalem” (Isaiah 40:2). And we learn it from the portion of this wicked one: With love – “he loved the young woman” (Genesis 34:3), with speech – “he spoke tenderly to [<i>al lev</i>] the young woman” (Genesis 34:3). Do you have a person who speaks to the heart [<i>al lev</i>]? It is, rather, matters that calm the heart.

Moreover, one may sprinkle hot water upon a wound on Shabbat. And if you say one bathes the circumcision, what is the difference between the wound of an adult and wound of a child. It is, rather, to teach you that one bathes the entire body of the child, which is not the case regarding an adult, as that [one] is only [allowed to bathe] the wound.’ Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: One bathes the child on the third day from circumcision that coincides with Shabbat. Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa said: At all times, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yonatan would instruct the midwives and say to them: ‘All the treatments that you administer during the week, perform them on Shabbat, on the third day that coincides with Shabbat.’ Shmuel said: It is due to danger. Rabbi Yosei said to him: ‘If it is due to danger, let us prepare hot water for him on Shabbat, as we learned: A person heats a cloth and places it upon his wound on Shabbat, and he may not take a bowl filled with hot water and place it on his belly on Shabbat,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This is for fear that the water will spill and cause a burn.</i> but hot water for a cure is permitted.’ Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: There is no prohibition; rather, it is permitted. <sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Boiling water on Shabbat in order to bathe the child on the third day is permitted.</i>
“The two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi…took” – from the fact that it says Simeon and Levi, we know that they are Jacob’s sons. It is, rather, “Jacob’s sons” – that they did not take counsel from Jacob; “Simeon and Levi” – that they did not take counsel from one another. “Dina's brothers” – was she only the sister of the two of them? Was she not the sister of all the tribes? It is, rather, because they endangered their lives on her behalf, she is called by their name. Similarly, “Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister” (Exodus 15:20) – was she [only] Aaron’s sister? Was she not sister of the two of them? It is, rather, because Aaron devoted himself on her behalf,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">He implored Moses to pray on Miriam’s behalf when she was afflicted with leprosy.</i> that is why she is called by his name. Similarly, “And in the matter of Kozbi, daughter of the prince of Midyan, their sister” (Numbers 25:18) – was she [only] their sister? Was she not a member of their nation? It is, rather, because she gave her life on behalf of her nation, her nation was called by her name. <br>“Each man took his sword” – Rabbi Elazar says: They were thirteen years old. <br><b>“They slew Ḥamor and Shekhem his son by the sword, and took Dina from Shekhem’s house, and departed” (Genesis 34:26).</b> <br>Shmuel asked Levi bar Sisi, he said to him: ‘What is that which is written: “And came upon the city confidently”?’ He said to him: ‘They were confident in the strength of the elder. Our patriarch Jacob did not want his sons to perform that act, but when his sons performed that act, he said: What, will I allow my sons to fall at the hand of the nations of the world. What did he do? He took his sword and his bow, stood at the entrance of Shekhem, and said: If the nations of the world come to confront my sons, I will battle against them.’ That is what he said to Joseph: “I have given to you one portion [<i>shekhem</i>] beyond your brothers…” (Genesis 48:22) – where do we find that our patriarch Jacob took his sword and his bow in Shekhem, as it is stated: “Which I took from the hand of the Emorite, with my sword and with my bow”?

<b>“God said to Jacob: Arise, ascend to Beit El, and settle there, and make there an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from Esau your brother” (Genesis 35:1).</b> <br>“God said to Jacob: Arise, ascend…” “It is a snare for a person to spout [<i>yala</i>] sanctity [<i>kodesh</i>]; scrutiny must follow vows” (Proverbs 20:25) – may a curse come upon one who eats consecrated items [<i>kodashim</i>] in his throat [<i>belo’o</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">One who eats consecrated items when he is not permitted to do so is punished. </i> Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: May a curse come upon a person who benefits from consecrated items.

Chapter 82

<b>“God appeared to Jacob again, upon his arrival from Padan Aram, and He blessed him” (Genesis 35:9).</b> <br>“God appeared to Jacob.” It is written: “Show me a sign for good, [so that those who hate me will see it and be shamed, for You, Lord, have helped me and comforted me]” (Psalms 86:17) – it is speaking of David but was fulfilled in Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The author of this statement was David. Although there is no indication that David’s request was fulfilled, Jacob did receive such a sign. </i> “A sign” – on the basis of what is stated: “If he said this: The speckled will be your wages [then all the flocks bore speckled]” (Genesis 31:8). “Those who hate me will see it” (Psalms 86:17) – this is Esau and his chieftains. “Have helped me” (Psalms 86:17) – with the trouble of Shekhem, as it is written: “The dread of God was upon the cities” (Genesis 35:5). “And comforted me” (Psalms 86:17) – with the blessing of the mourners.
It is written: “Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who may stand…? He who has clean hands…. He will receive the blessing from the Lord…” (Psalms 24:3–5).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These phrases are all interpreted as applying to Jacob. The first, “who may ascend the mountain of the Lord?” is an allusion to the verse: “Arise, ascend to Bet El” (Genesis 35:1) (<i>Etz Yosef</i>; see <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 24:9). </i> It is written: “So said the Lord of hosts, God of Israel: They will again say…the Lord will bless you, abode of righteousness, mountain of sanctity…” (Jeremiah 31:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The blessing mentioned in this verse, which refers to the God of Israel, is understood as applying to Jacob, also known as Israel (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> It is written: “A man of faith will abound with blessings” (Proverbs 28:20) – this is Jacob. “And one who hastens to become rich will not be absolved” (Proverbs 28:20) – this is Esau. It is written: “The blessing of the Lord, it will enrich” (Proverbs 10:22). “And one who hastens to become rich will not become rich” is not written here, but rather, “will not be absolved” – this is the wicked Esau, who married Yehudit, Basmat, and Maḥalat in order to increase wealth; he will never be cleansed. It is written: “I will cleanse; their blood I will not cleanse” (Joel 4:21) – that is what is written: “For his pursuit of his brother with the sword; and suppressing his mercy” (Amos 1:11). <br>“God appeared to Jacob again, upon his arrival.” Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “You shall craft for Me a stone altar…[I will come to you and I will bless you]” (Exodus 20:21) – the matters can be derived <i>a fortiori</i>: If one who crafts an altar to My name, I appear to him and bless him, Jacob, whose image is fixed on My throne, all the more so. <br>“God appeared to Jacob.” Rabbi Levi began: “And a bull and a ram for a peace offering…[for today the Lord shall appear to you” (Leviticus 9:4) – the matters can be derived <i>a fortiori</i>: If one who sacrifices a ram to my name, I appear to him and bless him, Jacob, whose image is fixed on My throne, all the more so. <br>“God appeared” – “Blessed are you upon your arrival, and blessed are you upon your departure” (Deuteronomy 28:6). Upon his arrival at his father-in-law’s house, he was laden with blessings: “May God Almighty bless you…” (Genesis 28:3), and upon his departure from his father-in-law’s house, he was laden with blessings: “God appeared to Jacob…[and He blessed him].”   <br>“Who confirms the word of His servant and fulfills the counsel of His messengers” (Isaiah 44:26) – Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: When He “confirms the word of his servant,” do we not know that He “fulfills the counsel of His messengers”? It indicates that one angel appeared to Jacob our patriarch and said to him: ‘The Holy One blessed be He is destined to appear to you in Beit El and change your name, and I am destined to be standing there.’ That is what is written: “In Beit El He will find us and there He will speak with us” (Hosea 12:5) – “will speak with you” is not written here, but rather, “there He will speak with us.” The Holy One blessed be He appeared to him to fulfill the angel’s words; [and for] Jerusalem, in whose regard all the prophets prophesy, all the more so that He will fulfill the words of His prophets.
“God appeared…again” – Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: “Again” – as it was initially. Just as initially, it was by means of an angel,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This was when Jacob was told to return to Canaan (Genesis 31:11). </i> so, too, the second [time] was by means of an angel. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: [God said:] ‘I will not associate My name with any person again; only with you and not with another, as it is stated: “I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob” (Exodus 6:3), and there is no other with them.’ Rabbi Yudan said: “Again” – I will appear to you another time.  <br>“And He blessed him” – with what blessing did He bless him? Rabbi Asi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: He blessed him with the blessing of the mourners.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob’s mother, Rebecca, had died (see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 81:5). </i>
<b>“God said to him: I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply; a nation and an assembly of nations will be from you, and kings will emerge from your loins” (Genesis 35:11).</b> <br>“God said to him: I am God Almighty.

It is that he expounded a midrash, and crowned Ish Boshet.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See II Samuel 2:8–9. </i> That is what is written: “And kings will emerge from your loins” – this is Saul and Ish Boshet. <br>What did they see that led them to draw near and ostracize in the case of the concubine in Giva?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Judges chap. 20–21. </i> It is, rather, that they read a verse and ostracized them, and read a verse and immediately welcomed them. They read a verse and ostracized them: “Ephraim and Manasseh will be like Reuben and Simeon for me” (Genesis 48:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They felt justified in ostracizing the tribe of Benjamin because Manasseh and Ephraim counted as two tribes, such that there would be twelve tribes even without Benjamin. </i> They read a verse and welcomed them: “A nation and an assembly of nations will be from you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">As stated above, this refers to Benjamin as well as Manasseh and Ephraim, and therefore they welcomed Benjamin back and cancelled his ostracization. </i>
Rabbi Yudan, Rabbi Aivu, and Rabbi Mashyan ben Nagari <Nagadi> said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: [God told Jacob:] ‘Your descendants are destined to become a nation like the assembly of peoples;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Your descendants will act like the other nations. </i> just as the assembly of peoples sacrifice [on private altars] at the time when the private altars are prohibited, so, your descendants will sacrifice at the time when the private altars are prohibited.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">It is permissible for other nations to sacrifice on private altars, even though they also have the ability to brings sacrifices to the Temple. Similarly, there will be a time when Jacob’s descendants will sacrifice a permissible offering on a private altar at a time when the prohibition of sacrificing on a private altar was in effect. This alludes to the incident of Elijah on Mount Carmel (see I Kings chapter 18; <i>Yefeh To’ar</i>). </i> Rabbi Ḥanina cites it from here: “Elijah took twelve stones [according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob,] to whom was the word of the Lord, saying: Israel will be your name” (I Kings 18:31) – from the moment that this name was given to him, it was stated to him: “A nation and an assembly of nations will be from you.” <br>Rabbi Simlai cites it from here: “They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather, who was born to Israel” (Judges 18:29) – from the moment that this name was given to him, it was stated to him: “A nation and an assembly of nations will be from you.” Rabbi Yoḥanan cites it from here: “They will call peoples to the mountain; there they will slaughter offerings of righteousness” (Deuteronomy 33:19) – when your descendants will become like the peoples at Zebulun’s mountain,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When they come to Mount Carmel to sacrifice offerings to idols. </i> “there they will slaughter offerings of righteousness.” It is not written here: “There they will offer prohibited offerings on private altars,” but rather, “offerings of righteousness.” I will perform righteousness with them and accept their offering. But “a nation and an assembly of nations will be from you” – to obligate each and every tribe; this is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shimon interprets the verse as stating that if one tribe sins unwittingly based on the ruling of the Sanhedrin, that tribe is obligated to collectively bring the bull offering for an unwitting communal sin (see Mishna <i>Horayot</i> 1:5).</i> Rabbi Yehuda says: To obligate each and every congregation.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda says that even if one tribe sinned based on the ruling of its own court, that tribe is obligated to collective bring the bull offering (see Mishna <i>Horayot</i> 1:5).</i>

Rachel –“Rachel was in childbirth, and had difficulty in her childbirth.” Pinḥas’s wife – “His daughter-in-law, wife of Pinḥas…[she crouched and gave birth, as her pangs of labor overcame her]” (I Samuel 4:19). Mikhal, as it is stated: “Mikhal daughter of Saul did not have a child until the day of her death” (II Samuel 6:23). Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: “Until the day of her death” she did not have, but on the day of her death she had.

When were the mixed breeds created? It was in the days of Ana. That is what is written: “He is Ana, who found the <i>yemim</i> in the wilderness.” Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Mules [<i>hamyonas</i>]. The Rabbis say: Half-breeds [<i>himisu</i>] – half donkey and half horse. These are the signs: If its ears are small, its mother is a horse and its father is a donkey; if they are large, its mother is a donkey and its father is a horse. Rabbi Mana would command those of the household of the Nasi that they should purchase those with the small ears, because their mothers are horses and their fathers are donkeys. What did Ana do? He brought a female donkey, crossed it with a horse, and a mule emerged. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I did not create anything that causes damage, but you created something that causes damage. As you live, I will create for you something that causes damage.’ What did He do? He brought a serpent, crossed it with a starred agama lizard, and a poisonous lizard resulted. A person never said that he was bitten by a rabid dog and he lived, by a poisonous lizard and he lived, or by a white mule and he lived. <br>Fire: Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Nezira: That light<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The light that was created on the first day of Creation.</i> served for thirty-six hours, twelve on Shabbat eve,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Friday.</i> twelve on Shabbat night, and twelve on Shabbat.

Because “His light is to the ends of the earth” (Job 37:3). When the sun set at the conclusion of Shabbat, darkness began to set in. Adam the first man became fearful, as it is written: “And I say: Darkness will conceal me” (Psalms 139:11). What did the Holy One blessed be He do for him? He prepared for him two flint stones, and [Adam] struck one against the other. Fire emerged and he recited a blessing over it. That is what is written: “Night is light for me” (Psalms 139:11). This is in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, [who said]: Why do we recite a blessing on a candle at the conclusion of Shabbat? Because then was the beginning of its creation. Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: One recites a blessing over it even at the conclusion of Yom Kippur because the fire rested that entire day.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Since one is not permitted to use the fire on Yom Kippur, and once Yom Kippur is over one is permitted to use it, one appreciates fire and recites the blessing. </i>

<b>“Jacob settled in the land of his father’s residence, in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 37:1).</b> <br>“Jacob settled” – it is written: “Your gathering will save you when you cry out” (Isaiah 57:13). It is taught: His gathering and the gathering of his sons saved him from Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Although originally Jacob was forced to flee from Esau, when he returned with his sons and they gathered in prayer together, Jacob was able to settle in the Land of Israel while Esau left and settled elsewhere (Genesis 36:6–8). </i> “But all of them the wind will carry off; futility will take them” (Isaiah 57:13) – this is Esau and his chieftains. “And the one who trusts Me will inherit the land” (Isaiah 57:13) – this is Jacob. “Jacob settled.”
“The wicked flee without a pursuer, but the righteous will be secure as a young lion” (Proverbs 28:1) – the wicked flee, but no one pursues them, as it is written: “[Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, all the members of his household, his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions that he acquired in the land of Canaan,] and went to a land” (Genesis 36:6). Rabbi Elazar said: Due to a promissory note.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">When God promised the Land of Israel to Abraham, he also stated that his descendants would be oppressed for many years in a strange land (see Genesis 15:6–16).

Know that it is so; Jacob our patriarch, because he sought to live in tranquility in this world, was confronted by the accuser regarding Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The heavenly accuser caused him to suffer distress due to the sale of Joseph. </i> “I was not tranquil, was not silent” (Job 3:26). “I was not tranquil” – from Esau; “was not silent” – from Laban. “And I did not rest” (Job 3:26) – from Dina. “But turmoil came” (Job 3:26) – the turmoil of Joseph came upon me.
Another matter: “Jacob settled…” – Abraham converted proselytes. That is what is written: “Abram took Sarai his wife…[and the people that they had made in Ḥaran]” (Genesis 12:5). Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: Were all who entered the world to assemble, they would be unable to create even a small gnat, and you say: “And the people that they had made in Ḥaran”? Rather, these are the proselytes that Abraham converted. Why, then, did it say “made” and did not say “converted”? It is to teach you that anyone who draws a proselyte near, it is as though he created him. Lest you say that Abraham was converting [proselytes] and Sarah was not converting [them], the verse states: “And the people that they had made in Ḥaran.” It is not written here, “That he had made,” but rather, “that they had made.” Rabbi Ḥunya said: Abraham would convert the men, and Sarah would convert the women. Why does the verse state: “That they had made”? It teaches that Abraham would bring them into his house, feed them, give them to drink, draw them near, and bring them under the wings of the Divine Presence.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The expression “that they had made” implies physical action, which is not necessarily included in converting proselytes. The midrash explains that the phrase refers to the fact that Abraham and Sarah would invite them into their home, feed them, and give them to drink (<i>Yefe To’ar</i>).<i></i> </i>  <br>Jacob, too, converted proselytes, as it is written: “Jacob said to his household, [and to all who were with him: Remove the foreign gods that are in your midst, and purify yourselves].… They gave to Jacob [all the foreign gods that were in their possession]” (Genesis 35:2, 4). In Isaac’s regard we have not heard. Where did we hear? Rabbi Yitzḥak said, and some taught it in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya Rabba in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: Here it is written: “Jacob settled in the land of his father’s residence.” What is [the meaning of] “his father’s residence [<i>megurei</i>]”? Those whom his father converted [<i>migiyurei</i>].
What is written prior to this matter? “These are the kings [who reigned in the land of Edom before the reign of a king for the children of Israel]” (Genesis 36:31). And here it is written: “Jacob settled” – Rabbi Ḥunya said: This is analogous to one who was walking on the way and saw a pack of dogs. He was afraid of them and he sat in their midst.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Dogs pursue those who run, so he sat and did not run.</i> So, when our patriarch Jacob saw Esau and his chieftains, he feared them and settled in their midst.  <br>Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a blacksmith whose [forge] was open to a plaza, and his son, a goldsmith, opened opposite him. He saw many bundles of thorns being brought into the city. He said: ‘Where will all these bundles be stored?’ There was a certain clever man there. He said to him: ‘Are you afraid of these? One spark will emerge from your [forge] and one spark from your son’s, and you will burn them.’ So, when Jacob saw Esau and his chieftains, he was afraid. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Are you afraid of these? One spark from you and one spark from your son will burn all of them. That is what is written: “The house of Jacob will be fire, and the house of Joseph a flame” (Obadiah 1:18) – “Jacob settled.” <br><b>“This is the legacy of Jacob. Joseph, seventeen years old, was herding the flock with his brothers, and he was a lad with the sons of Bilha, and with the sons of Zilpa, his father’s wives; Joseph brought evil report of them to their father” (Genesis 37:2).</b>  <br>So said the Sages: “This is the legacy [<i>toledot</i>] of Jacob, Joseph” – all of these offspring [<i>toladot</i>] resulted only due to the merit of Joseph and because of him.

All these offspring were waiting until Joseph was born.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob was afraid to return to his father in the land of Canaan, which would require him to confront Esau, until Joseph was born. </i> That is what is written: “It was, when Rachel bore Joseph” (Genesis 30:25) – when the rival of that wicked one<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Esau</i> was born, “Jacob said to Laban: Release me, and I will go” (Genesis 30:25). Who caused them to descend to Egypt? Joseph. Who supported them? Joseph. The sea was split only due to the merit of Joseph. That is what is written: “The waters saw You, God; the waters saw You and were frightened” (Psalms 77:17); “the depths sounded its voice” (Habakkuk 3:10); “with Your arm, You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph” (Psalms 77:16). Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Shimon said: The Jordan, too, split only due to the merit of Joseph. <br>Another matter: “Jacob settled” – so said the Sages: Jacob our patriarch did not enjoy settlement until he resided in his father’s residence. Which is that? It is the land of Canaan, as it was there that his father, Isaac, resided.  <br>Another matter: The numerical value of “residence [<i>megurei</i>]”<i> </i>is two hundred and fifty-nine<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mem</i> – 40; <i>gimmel</i> – 3; <i>vav</i> – 6; <i>resh</i> – 200; <i>yod</i> – 10.

Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: “This is the legacy [<i>toledot</i>] of Jacob, Joseph” – the verse need not have said so, but rather, “this is the legacy of Jacob, Reuben.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, when the verse introduces the legacy [<i>toledot</i>] of an individual, what follows is a list of his sons, and, often, their sons (see, e.g., Genesis 10:1).

It is not right that he should engage in [arranging for us to marry wives.’ They said to Judah: ‘Are you not the leader of us all? You arise and provide for yourself.’ Immediately, “Judah descended” – it is a descent for him that he married a gentile woman. It is a descent for him that he buried his wife and his sons.
Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon and Rabbi Ḥanin in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Anyone who begins a mitzva and does not complete it, buries his wife and his children. From whom do you derive this? It is from Judah. “Judah said to his brothers: What profit is it [if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?]” (Genesis 37:26). He should have borne him on his shoulder to his father. What did it cause for him? He buried his wife and his children. <br>Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: Anyone who begins a mitzva and does not complete it, but another comes and completes it, it is attributed to the second one. That is what is written: “Joseph’s bones, which the children of Israel took up” (Joshua 24:32). Did Moses not take them up, as it is stated: “Moses took Joseph’s bones with him” (Exodus 13:19)? But since it was decreed upon him that he would not enter the land, and these [the children of Israel] tended to them, it is therefore attributed to them. <br>“Joseph’s bones…” (Joshua 24:32) – they analogize it; to what is the matter comparable? To robbers who entered a certain wine cellar. They took a particular jug and drank. The owner of the cellar peered at them. He said to them: ‘May it be pleasant for you, may it be enjoyable for you, may it be sweet for you. You drank the wine, restore the jug to its place.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to the tribes: ‘You sold Joseph. Restore his bones to their place.’ <br>Another matter: Joseph said to them: ‘To the place from which you abducted me, return me’ – “are your brothers not herding in Shekhem?” (Genesis 37:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This proves that the sale of Joseph took place in or around Shekhem. </i> That is what the children of Israel did: “Joseph’s bones, which the children of Israel took up from Egypt, they buried in Shekhem” (Joshua 24:32).
“And turned to an Adulamite man, and his name was Ḥira” – the Rabbis say: Ḥira is Ḥiram who was in the days of David, as it is stated: “For Ḥiram had been David’s friend all the days” (I Kings 5:15) – this man was accustomed to being a friend of this tribe. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Ḥiram was someone else.

And he was not intimate with her anymore” (Genesis 38:26).</b> <br>“Judah identified…” – Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak: The divine spirit appeared in three places: In the court of Shem, in the court of Samuel, and in the court of Solomon. In the court of Shem – “Judah identified them, and said: She is more righteous than I [<i>mimeni</i>].” What is <i>mimeni</i>? Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You will attest to what is revealed, and I attest to what is concealed.’<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Judah could attest that he had been with Tamar, but he could not attest to the fact that no one else had been with her and that she had conceived from him. A Divine Voice therefore emerged and confirmed that which was concealed, namely that she had conceived from Judah and had not been intimate with anyone else. The word mimeni, which can also mean “from me,” is interpreted to mean that Tamar’s full exoneration was achieved with assistance from the Divine Voice, or that God announced that all of these events were “from Me,” meaning guided by Divine providence (see Kohelet Rabba 10:16). </i> In the court of Solomon – “she is his mother” (I Kings 3:27). Who said? Rabbi Shmuel said: A Divine Voice was shouting and saying: ‘She is certainly his mother!’ In the court of Samuel: “Here I am; testify against me.… He said… The Lord is witness for you, [and His anointed is witness this day, that you did not find anything in my hand.] They said: He is witness” (I Samuel 12:3–5). A Divine Voice emerged and said: “He is witness.”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">God testified that Samuel had never taken anything from the people. </i> <br>What does it say regarding Eli’s sons? “The sin of the lads was [very] great…” (I Samuel 2:17), and it is written: “That they would lie with the women who would assemble…” (I Samuel 2:22). Is it possible that it is so, that the sons of that righteous one would perform that act? Say now that because they would delay the bird offerings in Shilo and they thereby kept [the women] out of their houses for one night, the verse ascribes to them as though they had relations with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">A woman who gives birth is required to bring two birds as offerings. The sons of Eli were slow in sacrificing the various offerings that were brought to the Tabernacle. This caused the women to remain in Shilo overnight and to be delayed in returning home to their husbands, and the verse describes this as though the sons of Eli would lie with the women. </i> Similarly, “his sons did not follow his ways, and they turned to bribes” (I Samuel 8:3) – is it possible that the sons of the righteous Samuel would perform that act? Rabbi Berekhya said: A caravan would pass in Beersheba, and they would forsake the needs of the public and engage in their own business. Because of that action, the verse ascribed to them as though they took bribes. Similarly, “she sat at Petaḥ Einayim” (Genesis 38:14), as it is written above.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Above (section 7) it was written that she did not actually act as a harlot as indicated by the plain meaning of the verse. </i>
<b>“It was at the time of her giving birth, and, behold, there were twins in her womb” (Genesis 38:27).</b> <br>“It was at the time of her giving birth” – here they were incomplete, but elsewhere they were complete.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding Rebecca’s birth of Jacob and Esau it is written: “Her days to give birth were complete” (Genesis 25:24).</i> <br>“Behold there were twins [<i>teomim</i>] in her womb” – <i>teomim </i>is written complete, as here they were both righteous. Elsewhere <i>tomim</i> (Genesis 25:24)<i> </i>is written, incomplete, as one was righteous and one was wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the birth of Jacob and Esau, the word for twins is written without an alef, so that it is read tomim rather than teomim. This is because only Jacob was righteous. </i> <br><b>“It was as she was giving birth, one extended a hand; the midwife took and bound upon his hand a crimson thread, saying: This one emerged first” (Genesis 38:28).</b> <br>“It was as she was giving birth, one extended a hand” – Rava bar Rav Ḥisda said: There are three who are believed immediately, and these are: The midwife, the caravan, and a woman who attests to the purity of another woman. Midwife – as it is written: “The midwife took and bound upon his hand a crimson thread, saying: This one emerged first.” Caravan – as Rabbi Simon brother of Rabbi Yehuda bar Zavdi said in the name of Rav: A child, as long as he is cast in the street, his father and mother can testify in his regard. When he is gathered from the street, he requires two witnesses.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">If a young child is abandoned in the street, and adults come and claim to be his parents who were passing by in a caravan and lost their child, they are believed. But if the child has already been taken in from the street, testimony is required to establish the relationship between the child and individuals who claim to be his parents. See also Kiddushin 73b. </i> And a woman who attests to the purity of another woman – as we learned: If three women were sleeping in one bed and there was blood under one of them, they are all impure. If one of them examined herself and found blood, she alone is impure. Rava said: Provided that it is within twenty-four hours.
<b>“It was as he retracted his hand, and behold, his brother emerged; and she said: What breach have you breached for yourself?

Rav Huna said: Corresponding to the four items that he was destined to take from the proscription.

Chapter 86

<b>“Joseph was taken down to Egypt and Potiphar, the official of Pharaoh, the chief executioner, an Egyptian man, purchased him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there” (Genesis 39:1).</b> <br>“Joseph was taken down to Egypt.” It is written: “With ropes of man I drew them, [with bonds of love; I was for them like those who lift the yoke above their jaws, and I leaned to them to provide food]” (Hosea 11:4) – these are Israel, [as it is stated]: “Draw me; after you I will run” (Song of Songs 1:4). “With bonds of love” (Hosea 11:4) – as it is written: “I loved you, said the Lord” (Malachi 1:2). “I was for them like those who lift the yoke” (Hosea 11:4) – as I elevated their enemies over them. Why to that extent? “Above their jaws” (Hosea 11:4) – because of the words that they expressed with their jaws, as they said: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This was stated by the Israelites as they committed the sin of the Golden Calf. </i> But ultimately, “I leaned to them to provide food” (Hosea 11:4) – I provide them with many foods to eat; “There will be abundance of grain in the land” (Psalms 72:16). <br>Another matter, “with ropes of man I drew them [<i>emshakhem</i>]” (Hosea 11:4) – this is Joseph, [as it is stated]: “They pulled [<i>vayimshekhu</i>] and lifted Joseph from the pit” (Genesis 37:28). “With bonds of love” (Hosea 11:4) – “Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons” (Genesis 37:3). “I was for them like those who lift the yoke” (Hosea11:4) – as I elevated his enemies over him. Who was that? It was Potiphar’s wife. Why to that extent? “Above their jaws” (Hosea 11:4) – because of the words that he expressed with his jaws – “Joseph brought evil report of them to their father” (Genesis 37:2). But ultimately, “I leaned to them to provide food (Hosea 11:4) – an abundance of food.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Eventually, after his actions caused him to be brought down to Egypt, Joseph ended up providing food for his entire family, as well as for the entire population of Egypt and other lands. </i>
Another matter, “Joseph was taken down to Egypt.” “Joseph was the ruler” (Genesis 42:6). “Joseph was taken down [<i>hurad</i>] to Egypt” – he ruled over them, just as it says: “He will rule [<i>veyerd</i>] from sea to sea” (Psalms 72:8). He subdued them, just as it says: “For he had dominion [<i>rodeh</i>] over the entire region across the River” (I Kings 5:4). He imposed relocation upon them,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 47:21. </i> just as it says: “He scraped it [<i>vayirdehu</i>] into his hands” (Judges 14:9).  <br>He caused Jacob our patriarch to descend [<i>horid</i>] to Egypt. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: This is analogous to a cow that they were pulling to the slaughterhouse, but it would not be pulled. What did they do to it? They pulled its offspring before it, and it was walking after it despite itself, and to its [ultimate] detriment. So, Jacob was supposed to descend to Egypt in chains and neck chains.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is because of the decree of enslavement in the Covenant between the Pieces (see Genesis 15:13).</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Shall I take My firstborn son down [to Egypt] in disgrace?

Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Simon: From where do we derive that the Divine Presence descended with him? From what is written: “The Lord was with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). <br>“To Egypt [<i>Mitzraima</i>]” – it is taught in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: Any word that requires a <i>lamed </i>at its start, a <i>heh</i> [can be] placed at its end [instead]: <i>Sedoma</i>, <i>Se’ira</i>, <i>Mitzraima</i>, <i>Ḥarana</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>lamed</i> as a prefix or the <i>heh</i> as a suffix both mean “to.” These are examples where the verse uses the <i>heh</i> at the end of the name of the place, indicating “to Sodom” and the like. </i> But is it not written: “The wicked will return to the netherworld [<i>lishola</i>]”?

“[Potiphar...an Egyptian man,] purchased him [from the Ishmaelites]” – those who were acquired were acquiring.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Ishmaelites descend from Hagar, Sarah’s maidservant, and the Egyptians descend from Ḥam, of whom it is stated: “A slave of slaves he shall be to his brothers” (Genesis 9:25), and they were the ones purchasing and selling Joseph.</i> All slaves damage the household of their masters. But this one – “the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph’s sake” (Genesis 39:5). All slaves are suspected of robbery, but this one: “Joseph collected all the silver…[Joseph brought the silver to Pharoah’s house]” (Genesis 47:14). All slaves are suspected of licentiousness, but this one: “But he did not heed her” (Genesis 39:10). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: All slaves, their master feeds <i>teruma </i>to their slaves, but this one fed his master <i>teruma</i>, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Elazar took a wife from the daughters of Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph was married to Potiphar’s daughter, so Potiphar’s granddaughter married Elazar, the son of Aaron, and ate <i>teruma</i>.</i> <br>Potiphar is “Potifera” (Genesis 41:45).

This teaches that [Potiphar] purchased [Joseph] only for intercourse, but the Holy One blessed be He castrated him. This is analogous to a she-bear that was killing its master’s children. He said: ‘Break its teeth.’ So, it teaches that [Potiphar] purchased him only for intercourse, and the Holy One blessed be He castrated him. That is what is written: “For the Lord loves justice [and does not forsake] His pious ones [<i>ḥasidav</i>]” (Psalms 37:28). <i>Ḥasido </i>is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ḥasidav </i>is written with only one <i>vav</i>, such that it can be read <i>ḥasido</i>, “His pious one,” in singular. It should be noted however that the Masoretic text of Psalms actually has the word <i>ḥasidav</i> with two <i>vavs</i>. The midrash here cites a different tradition. Alternatively, in <i>Midrash Shmuel</i> the version of the text cites I Samuel 2:9 rather than Psalms, and in that verse the word in fact appears as <i>ḥasido</i>, with one <i>vav</i> (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Who is that? It is Joseph. “They are guarded forever, while the seed of the wicked is cut off” (Psalms 37:28) – this teaches that [Potiphar] purchased him only for intercourse, and the Holy One blessed be He castrated him. <br>“Potiphar…an Egyptian man, purchased him [from [<i>miyad</i>] the Ishmaelites]” – a clever man. What was his cleverness? He said: In every place, a German sells a Cushite,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A white man sells a man of dark complexion (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> but here, a Cushite is selling a German? This is no slave. He said to them: ‘Bring me a guarantor,’ as the term “from [<i>miyad</i>]” is nothing other than a guarantor, just as it says: “I will guarantee him, [from me [<i>miyadi</i>] you can demand him]” (Genesis 43:9). That is why it says: “From [<i>miyad</i>] the Ishmaelites.”  <br>Rabbi Levi said: A slave purchased, the son of a maidservant sold, and a free man was a slave to both of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Potiphar, the Egyptian, was a descendant of Canaan, who was cursed by Noah to be a slave (see Genesis 9:25).

<b>“The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a successful man, and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian” (Genesis 39:2).</b> <br>“The Lord was with Joseph” – but with the rest of the tribes, He was not? Rabbi Yudan said: [This is analogous] to an animal driver, who had twelve animals laden with wine before him. One of them entered the shop of an idolater; he forsook the eleven and followed after it. They said to him: ‘Why do you forsake eleven [animals] and follow the one?’ He said to them: ‘These are in the public domain, and I am not concerned lest [the wine] become libation wine.’<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">I am not concerned that an idolator will take the wine and use it for a libation to an idol, rendering it forbidden.

That is why, “the Lord was with Joseph.” <br>“He was a successful [<i>matzliaḥ</i>] man” – Rabbi Berekhya said: A leaping man,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">He was able to surmount all obstacles.</i> just as it says: “They crossed [<i>vetzalḥu</i>] the Jordan before the king” (II Samuel 19:18).

They said: ‘Anyone who jumps on it can take everything that is on it.’ There was a certain clever man there. He said to them: ‘You are looking at what is on it. I am looking at its teeth.’<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, while the masses approached the bear, the clever man distanced himself from it.

<b>“Joseph found favor in his eyes, and he served him.

<b>“It was after these matters that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said: Lie with me” (Genesis 39:7).</b> <br>“It was after these matters.” “I saw among the naïve [<i>bapetayim</i>]” (Proverbs 7:7) – these are the tribes. Rabbi Levi said: In Arabia, they call children <i>patya</i>. “Discerned among the youths a lad” (Proverbs 7:7) – this is Joseph. He was “devoid of understanding” (Proverbs 7:7), as he would speak slander about his brothers. Is there anyone more devoid of understanding? From that, their descent to Egypt developed. “And behold, there is a woman to meet him” (Proverbs 7:10) – this is Potiphar’s wife, who confronted Joseph. “Dressed like a harlot” (Proverbs 7:10) – for Joseph. “And wily of heart” (Proverbs 7:10) – for Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Her public persona was modest.</i> “She is turbulent and rebellious” (Proverbs 7:11) – muttering and confused.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Due to her lust.</i> “Her feet do not abide in her house” (Proverbs 7:11) – but rather, “sometimes in the street, [sometimes in the squares, she lurks at every corner]” (Proverbs 7:12) – she would ask and say: ‘Have you seen Joseph?’ “She seized him and kissed him” (Proverbs 7:13) – “she seized him by his garment” (Genesis 39:12). “She was brazen and said to him” (Proverbs 7:13) – “lie with me” (Genesis 39:12).
“It was after these matters.” It is written: “Indeed, the rod of wickedness will not rest [<i>lo yanuaḥ</i>]…” (Psalms 125:3) – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana and Rabbi Yitzḥak, Rabbi Abba said: He gets no satisfaction [<i>neyaḥa</i>] in the company of the righteous, but only in the company of the wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The wicked do not get satisfaction from being with the righteous (<i>Yefeh To’ar</i>).

This is analogous to a mighty man who was standing in the street grooming his eyes, curling his hair, and lifting his heels.

“It was after these matters…” – there was a contemplation of matters there. Who contemplated? Joseph contemplated. He said: ‘When I was in Father’s house, Father would see which fine portion was there, and he would give it to me. My brothers would look at me enviously. Now that I am here, I am grateful to You that I have relief.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Carefree one, as you live, I will incite the she-bear against you.’ <br>Another matter, he said: ‘Father was subjected to ordeals, my grandfather was subjected to ordeals, will I not encounter ordeals?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, I will subject you to ordeals greater than theirs.’ <br>Rabbi Menaḥama said in the name of Rabbi Beivai: This was the standard practice of the idolaters: When one of them would acquire slaves, he would go to the astrologer, who would say to him: ‘Behold it is good, a good portent.’ This term, “cast [<i>vatisa</i>],” is nothing other than a term of astrologers, just as it says: “Lest you lift [<i>tisa</i>] your eyes to the heavens [and see the sun and moon and the stars, all the host of the heavens, and you are led astray…]” (Deuteronomy 4:19). <br>“She said: Lie with me” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The wicked are accursed.

If the evil inclination is removed from the world, there is no darkness and shadow of death in the world. <br>Another matter, “He sets an end to darkness” – He set a time for Joseph, how many years he would spend in the darkness in prison. When the end came, Pharaoh dreamed a dream.
“It was at the conclusion of two years.” “In all toil there is advantage, but lips’ talk is only for detriment” (Proverbs 14:23). Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said: Like the difference between one who drinks hot water and one who drinks cold.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Even the toil of heating water brings an advantage, as hot water was considered more healthy to drink (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> “But lips’ talk is only for detriment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If someone just talks and does not take action, he will suffer. </i> There was a certain bone gatherer in Tzippori, some say he was Rabbi Shimon bar Abba.

“Happy is the man who has made the Lord his trust” (Psalms 40:5) – this is Joseph. “And did not turn to the proud” (Psalms 40:5) – because he said to the chief butler: “Remember me…and mention me,” two years were added for him. “Happy is the man who makes the Lord his trust” – Rabbi Yudan said: Many myriads of myriads tend after falsehood, woe unto anyone who puts his trust in them. <br>“For a dream comes with a multitude of concerns” (Ecclesiastes 5:2) – Pharaoh said: ‘Who stands over whom – I for my god, or my god over me?’<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Nile was an Egyptian deity.

Why were two years added for him? So that Pharaoh would dream and [Joseph] would be elevated by means of the dream, as it is stated: “It was at the conclusion of two years.”
“And Pharaoh was dreaming” – do not all people dream? Astonishing! It is, rather, that a king’s dream pertains to the entire world. <br>“And Pharaoh was dreaming.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The wicked stand over their gods – “and Pharaoh was dreaming: and, behold, he stood at the Nile.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “at [<i>al</i>] the Nile” can also be translated “over the Nile.” </i> But the righteous, their God stands over them [to protect them]: “Behold, the Lord stood over him” (Genesis 28:13). <br><b>“And, behold, there were coming up from the Nile seven cows, fair of appearance and fat-fleshed, and they grazed in the pasture [<i>baaḥu</i>].

Likewise it says: “Your livestock will graze on that day on a broad plain [<i>kar nirḥav</i>]” (Isaiah 30:23) – a satiated [<i>kiri</i>] slave, a satiated [<i>kiri</i>] master. Likewise it says: “The mountains will bear peace [for the people]” (Psalms 72:3) – if the mountains have borne their produce, there is peace among the people. <br><b>“And, behold, seven stalks, thin and blighted by the east wind, were growing after them” (Genesis 41:6).</b> <br>“And, behold, seven stalks, thin…” – when the years are bad, people’s bodies break out in sores.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The term employed by the verse for growing is <i>tzomeḥot</i>, and in rabbinic Hebrew the related term <i>tzemaḥim</i> is another word for sores. </i>

But when the Holy One blessed be He judges the world, He takes them from it, as it is stated: “I will eliminate the wise from Edom, and understanding from the mountain of Esau…Your mighty will be intimidated, Teiman” (Obadiah 1:8–9).  <br>Why was all this [necessary]?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Why did God arrange for various advisors and magicians to offer interpretations of Pharoah’s dream before the butler suggested that he consult Joseph? </i> It was so Joseph would ultimately come, and gain prominence.

The magicians could say to him: ‘Had you asked us first, we would have already interpreted it for you.’ Instead, He waited until they exerted themselves, and exhausted [Pharoah’s] spirit. Then Joseph came and restored his spirit. In his regard, Solomon said: “The fool vents all his spirit” (Proverbs 29:11) – these are Pharaoh’s wise men; “but the wise man will soothe it, keeping it back” (Proverbs 29:11) – this is Joseph, as it is stated: “There is no one as understanding and wise as you” (Genesis 41:39).
<b>“The chief butler spoke to Pharaoh, saying: I mention my sins today” (Genesis 41:9).</b> <br>When the chief butler saw that Pharaoh’s soul was on the verge of departing, he began calculating and saying: If Pharaoh dies and another king assumes the throne, I do not know whether or not he will keep me in my position of trust. <br>“The chief butler spoke” – he said: ‘I have committed two sins.

Immediately, “Pharaoh sent and summoned.”  <br>“There with us…” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Cursed are the wicked, who do not perform complete goodness: “Lad” – a fool; “Hebrew” – an enemy; “slave” – as so it was written in Pharaoh’s books, that a slave cannot reign and does not wear <i>kelidim</i> <meaning: Bracelet [<i>keli yadayim</i>]>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Bracelets worn by royals.</i>
“We told him, and he interpreted [our dreams] for us.” There was an incident involving a certain woman who came before Rabbi Elazar. She said to him: ‘In my dream, I saw the ceiling beam of my house broken.’ He said to her: ‘You will bear a male child and he will live.’ She went, and so it was for her. She came another time to ask him. She found his students sitting there, but their rabbi was not with them. She said to them: ‘Where is your rabbi?’ They said to her: ‘Tell us your inquiry and we will tell you [the answer].’ She said to them: ‘In my dream, I saw the ceiling beam of my house broken.’ They said to her: ‘This woman will bury her husband.’ When she went out from before them, she began wailing. Rabbi Elazar heard her voice. He said to them: ‘What did you say to that woman?’ They said: ‘It is that woman who came to ask you.’ He said to them: ‘What did you say to her?’ They said to him: ‘Such and such.’ He said to them: ‘You have eliminated a man.

Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina said: The famine lasted two years, as once Jacob our patriarch descended there, the famine ceased. When did it return? In the days of Ezekiel.

<b>“Pharaoh said to his servants: Can we find a man like this, in whom there is the spirit of God?” (Genesis 41:38).</b> <br>“Pharaoh said to his servants: Can we find [a man] like this…?” “One is my faultless dove, the only one of her mother…” (Song of Songs 6:9). “One is my faultless dove” – this is Abraham, as it is stated: “Abraham was one, and he inherited the land” (Ezekiel 33:24). “The only one of her mother” – this is Isaac, who was his mother’s only son. “Pure [<i>bara</i>] to the one who bore her” (Song of Songs 6:9) – this is Jacob, as it was clear [<i>barur</i>] to the one who bore him that he was righteous. “Girls saw her and lauded her” (Song of Songs 6:9) – these are the tribes, “the news was heard in Pharaoh's house, [saying: Joseph's brothers have come; and it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and the eyes of his servants]” (Genesis 45:16). “Queens and concubines, and praised her” (Song of Songs 6:9) – this is Joseph. “Pharaoh said to his servants: Can we find…like this…?” If we go from one end of the world to the other, we will not find one like this.

One verse says: “You will be only [<i>rak</i>] above [and not below]” (Deuteronomy 28:13). Does it, perhaps, [mean you will be] on a par with Me? Impossible!

The verse states: “For I, the Lord your God, am holy” (Leviticus 19:2) – My sanctity is above your sanctity. We learn this from the wicked Pharaoh. “I am Pharaoh” (Genesis 41:44) – does it, perhaps, [mean you will be] on a par with me? The verse states: “I am Pharaoh” – my greatness is above your greatness. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: From the “I” of flesh and blood, you derive the “I” of the Holy One blessed be He. Just as regarding the “I” of flesh and blood, through the wicked Pharaoh saying to Joseph: “I am Pharaoh,” [Joseph] received all this honor; when the “I” of the Holy One blessed be He will come: “I have made, and I will bear” (Isaiah 46:4), all the more so.

<b>“Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons: Why do you make yourselves conspicuous?” (Genesis 42:1).</b> <br>“Jacob saw that there was grain [<i>shever</i>] in Egypt” – “Happy is he whose help is from the God of Jacob, whose hope [<i>sivro</i>] is in the Lord his God” (Psalms 146:5). “Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt” – “Behold, He demolishes, and it will not be rebuilt” (Job 12:14) – once the Holy One blessed be He stymied the intention of the tribes,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The plan of Joseph’s brothers to kill him. </i> it was not restored. “He shuts a man in, and it will not be opened” (Job 12:14) – these are the ten tribes, who were entering and exiting Egypt, and they did not know that Joseph was alive. But it was revealed to Jacob that Joseph was alive, as it is stated: “Jacob saw that there was <i>shever</i> in Egypt” – “that there was disaster [<i>shever</i>]”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>shever</i>, generally translated in Genesis 42:1 to mean grain, can also mean disaster; see, e.g., Lamentations 2:11. </i> – this is the famine; “that there was hope [<i>sever</i>]”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse as though it said “hope [<i>sever</i>],” because the letters <i>shin</i> and <i>sin</i> are interchangeable. </i> – this is the plenty. “That there was disaster [<i>shever</i>]” – “Joseph was taken down to Egypt” (Genesis 39:1); “that there was hope [<i>sever</i>]” – “Joseph was the ruler over the land” (Genesis 42:6). “That there was disaster [<i>shever</i>]” – “they will be enslaved to them and they will oppress them” (Genesis 15:13); “that there was hope [<i>sever</i>]” – “then they will emerge with great wealth” (Genesis 15:14). “Who says to the sun and it does not shine” (Job 9:7) – this is Jacob; “and seals the stars” (Job 9:7) – these are the ten tribes, who were entering and exiting Egypt, and they did not know that Joseph was alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Job is thus understood to mean that God withheld the full “shine” of the divine spirit from Jacob, and although he had a sense that Joseph was alive, he did not have clear knowledge of the matter. On the other hand, God withheld this sense entirely from Joseph’s brothers (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> But it was revealed to Jacob that Joseph was alive.
“Jacob said to his sons: Why do you make yourselves conspicuous?” – he said to them: ‘Do not take out bread [<i>perusa</i>] <variant reading: Money [<i>perutot</i>]> in your hands,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is based on the premise that there was no shortage of food in Jacob’s household.</i> and do not enter all of you in one entrance, due to the evil eye.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">So as not to arouse envy.</i> <br><b>“He said: Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt.

Astonishing! It is, rather, nine parts were for fraternity, and one to acquire grain.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The primary motivation for the brothers in their journey to Egypt was to locate Joseph, rather than the purchase of grain. </i> “But Benjamin, Joseph's brother…”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since the verse specifies that Joseph’s brothers came with the exception of Benjamin, it was obvious that there were ten.

<b>“The sons of Israel came to acquire grain among [<i>betokh</i>] those who came, as the famine was in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 42:5).</b> <br>“The sons of Israel came to acquire…” – from where is it derived that a congregation is ten [men]?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated regarding the law that matters of sanctity, such as <i>kaddish</i> and <i>kedusha</i>, can be recited only with a quorum of ten men (see <i>Megilla</i> 23b).</i> Rabbi Abba bar Kahana and Rabbi Yosei in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: “Congregation”<i> </i>(Numbers 35:24) is stated here,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the makeup of the Sanhedrin.</i> and elsewhere it is stated: “Until when for this evil congregation…?” (Numbers 14:27); just as “congregation” that is written elsewhere is ten,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The reference in Numbers 14:27 is to the spies who delivered an evil report to the Israelites in the wilderness.

This implies that a minor who does not yet have two pubic hairs may not be counted toward the quorum. </i> Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: It is necessary for the case of two minors, one [whose status] is uncertain and one who is [certainly] a minor;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The teaching that one is not particular regarding a minor refers to the case of two minors; one has two pubic hairs but has not yet reached the age of thirteen, and the other does not yet have two pubic hairs (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> one renders the uncertain one as part of the quorum and the minor as a completion.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The minor whose status is certain may count only as the tenth man in the quorum. </i> It is taught: One may count a minor and a Torah scroll as the completion of ten.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">If the minor is holding a Torah scroll, he may be considered the tenth man in the quorum. </i> Rabbi Yudan said: This is the <i>baraita</i>: One may count a minor as the completion for a Torah scroll.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">One may include a minor in the tally of seven people called to the Torah during the Torah reading on Shabbat (Maharzu). </i> From when may one count his as the completion?

Similarly, he may not count toward the three men necessary for <i>zimmun</i>, because without him they do not have the obligation to recite <i>zimmun</i> at all (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> Rabbi Asi said: Many times I ate with Rabbi Taḥlifa and many times I ate with Rabbi Ḥanina bar Sisi my uncle, and they did not include me in the <i>zimmun </i>until I grew two hairs. From when may he read the Torah? Rabbi Avina said: Rav Huna and Rabbi Yehuda dispute [the answer to] this, both of them in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: One said: From when he knows how to recite a blessing. The other says: From when he knows the nature of the blessing and to Whom he recites a blessing. <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Shilat raised a question before Rav and some say: A question was raised before Shmuel bar Shilat: [If] nine [ate] bread and one [ate vegetables, what is [the ruling]?

Rabbi Shimon ben Shataḥ went up to King Yannai. He said to him: ‘Three hundred nazirites ascended and are obligated to sacrifice nine hundred offerings, but they do not have [the means]. You give half from yours and I will give half from mine, and let them go and sacrifice.’ King Yannai gave half from his and they went and sacrificed. Someone came and spoke slander to King Yannai about Shimon ben Shataḥ: ‘Know that everything that they sacrificed, they sacrificed from yours, but Shimon ben Shataḥ did not give anything from his.’ King Yannai became angry at Shimon ben Shataḥ. [Shimon ben Shataḥ ] heard that he was angry at him, and he was distressed <variant reading: he was frightened> and he fled.  <br>Some time later, there were dignitaries from the Persian Empire who were eating at King Yannai’s table.

[King Yannai] said to him: ‘Why did you flee?’ [Shimon ben Shataḥ said:] ‘I heard that my lord the king was angry at me, and I was frightened of you [and wanted to ensure] that you would not kill me, so I fulfilled this verse: “Hide for a brief moment, until fury will pass”’ (Isaiah 26:20).

In all my days, I never heard Yannai in the blessing.’ He said: ‘What should I say, let us recite a blessing for what we ate? But I did not eat.’<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Generally, when three men participate in a meal, Grace after Meals is preceded by <i>zimmun</i>, an introductory section in which one of the lines is: Blessed is He from whose [food] we have eaten.

Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Actually, one does not include him in the <i>zimmun</i>, until he eats an olive-bulk of grain. But is it not taught: [If] two [ate] bread and one [ate] vegetables, they recite the <i>zimmun</i>? That <i>baraita </i>is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
<b>“Joseph was the ruler over the land; he was the provider of grain to all the people of the land. Joseph's brothers came, and prostrated themselves to him, faces to the ground” (Genesis 42:6).</b> <br>“Joseph was the ruler…” – he issued three edicts: That no slave shall enter Egypt; that no man shall enter with two donkeys, and that donkey drivers shall not transport grain from place to place; that a person shall not enter until he writes his name, his father’s name, and his grandfather’s name.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">All this was to increase the chances that Joseph’s brothers would come, and to ensure that if they were to come, Joseph would know.</i> Manasseh was standing there collecting the notes [with the names]. [Joseph’s brothers] said: ‘Let us enter and see. If they make claims against us with a measured rate of taxes, that is fine. If not, in the morning we will see what we will do.’<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">When Manasseh saw their notes listing their names, he summoned them to appear before Joseph. The brothers thought, if we are being detained on account of the need to pay standard taxes, we will do so; otherwise, we will see what we need to do (<i>Yefeh To’ar</i>). </i>
Another matter: “Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt.” It is written: “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him, but blessing will be on the head of the provider” (Proverbs 11:26). “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him” – this is Pharaoh; “but blessing will be on the head of the provider – this is Joseph. “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him” – this is Pharaoh, who hoarded the grain during the years of famine, and the people were cursing him. But Joseph sustained the world during the years of famine, like a shepherd leading his flock. In his regard, David said: “Shepherd of Israel, listen. Appear to us, You who led Joseph like a flock” (Psalms 80:2). When there was a famine during the days of David, he asked for mercy from before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, lead your flock like Joseph, who sustained the world during the years of famine.’  <br>When the famine intensified, the Egyptians gathered and came to Joseph. They said to him: ‘Give us bread.’ He said to them: ‘My God does not sustain the uncircumcised. Go and circumcise yourselves and I will give to you.’ They went to Pharaoh and were crying out and weeping before him, as it is stated: “The entire land of Egypt was hungry, [and the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread]” (Genesis 41:55). He said: “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you shall do” (Genesis 41:55). They said to him: ‘We went to him and he said empty matters to us, saying: Circumcise yourselves.’ He said to them: ‘Fools, did I not say to you from the outset: Obey him and acquire grain. Did he not proclaim to you during the years of plenty and command you: Know that there is a famine coming? You yourselves were negligent. Why did you not place in your houses grain to last two, three, or four years?’ They said to him: ‘The grain that was in our houses rotted.’ He said to them: ‘Is there no flour leftover for you from yesterday?’ They said to him: ‘Even the bread that was in the basket rotted.’ He said to them: “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you shall do.” He said to them: ‘If he issues a decree upon grain and it rots, perhaps he will issue a decree upon us and kill us.’ He said to them: ‘“Go to Joseph,” if he tells you cut your flesh, heed him,’ as it is stated: “What he says to you, you shall do.”  <br>“The famine was on the entire face [of the earth]” (Genesis 41:56). It would have been fitting for the verse to say: “On the earth.” Why does the verse say: “On the face”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It is to teach you that the famine began only with the wealthy, as “the face of the earth” is only the wealthy. That is why it is stated: “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him” – when a person is wealthy, his face is happy to see another, but when a person is indigent, he does not have a face to see, because he is ashamed in front of others.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This is implied in the phrase “the famine was on the entire face.” </i> That is why it was stated: “The withholder of grain, the nation will curse him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The word “nation [<i>le’om</i>]” is interpreted to refer to the wealthy, prominent members of the nation (Rashash). </i>
Another matter, “Jacob saw that there was grain [<i>shever</i>] in Egypt” – was Jacob in Egypt that he saw grain in Egypt, such that the verse states: “Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt”? But did he not say [differently] to his sons, [as it is stated]: “He saidBehold, I have heard [that there is grain in Egypt]”? It is, rather, that from the day that Joseph was abducted, the Divine Spirit left him, and he would see but not see, hear but not hear.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">He had from the Divine Spirit a vague idea of things that he would not otherwise know, but he did not have a clear understanding of them. </i> Why does it not say “there was food in Egypt,” but instead it is written: “That there was grain [<i>shever</i>] in Egypt”? Is it not already stated: “The entire land of Egypt was hungry”? Why does the verse state: “There was grain [<i>shever</i>]”? Rather, do not read it as “there was grain [<i>shever</i>],” but rather, “there was hope [<i>sever</i>],” as he foresaw that his hope was in Egypt. What was that? That was Joseph. <br>“Jacob said to his sons: Why do you make yourselves conspicuous?” Jacob said to his sons: ‘You are mighty, you are handsome, do not enter through one gate and do not stand in one place, so that the evil eye will not have dominion over you.’ <br>“Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there.” What is “go down”? He foresaw that they would descend and be enslaved in Egypt. <br>Another matter, “go down there” – as anyone who purchases grain from the marketplace, descent is written in his regard.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This is because he is dependent upon market conditions for his basic sustenance (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i>  <br>“Joseph’s brothers descended” (Genesis 42:3). The verse should have said: “The children of Israel.” It is that initially, they did not treat him with brotherhood and sold him, but ultimately they had regrets and were saying: ‘When will we descend to Egypt and return our brother to his father?’ When their father told them to descend to Egypt, they all came to a consensus to return him. <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Joseph, too, knew that his brothers were descending to Egypt to acquire food. What did he do? He positioned guards at all the entrances and said to them: ‘See each one who enters to acquire food, and write his name and his father’s name.’ In the evening, they would bring the notes to him. This is what they did. When Jacob’s sons came, each and every one entered through his own gate, and they wrote their names. In the evening, they brought [Joseph] the notes. This one read: ‘Reuben son of Jacob,’ another read: ‘Simeon son of Jacob,’ and another ‘Levi,’ and likewise, all the gatekeepers, each one brought his own. Immediately, Joseph said: ‘Seal all the storehouses and keep open one storehouse.’ He gave their names to the proprietor of the storehouse. He said to him: ‘See, when these people come to you, apprehend them, and send them before me.’ Three days passed and they did not come. Immediately, Joseph took seventy mighty men from the king’s palace and dispatched them to the marketplace. They went and found them in the marketplace of harlots. What was the nature of their presence in the marketplace of harlots? It is that they said: ‘Our brother Joseph is fair of form and fair of appearance; perhaps he is in a tent.’<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps he was forced to work as a male prostitute (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> They apprehended them and brought them before Joseph. <br><b>“Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them, and spoke harshly to them; he said to them: From where did you come? They said: From the land of Canaan, to acquire food” (Genesis 42:7). <br>“Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him” (Genesis 42:8). <br>“Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed about them, and said to them: You are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you have come” (Genesis 42:9). <br>“They said to him: No, my lord, but your servants have come to acquire food” (Genesis 42:10). <br>“We are all the sons of one man; we are sincere, your servants have not been spies” (Genesis 42:11). <br>“And he said to them: No, to see the nakedness of the land you have come” (Genesis 42:12). <br>“They said: We, your servants, are twelve brothers, sons of one man in the land of Canaan and, behold, the youngest is with our father today, and one is absent” (Genesis 42:13).</b> <br>Immediately, “he acted as a stranger [<i>vayitnaker</i>] to them, and spoke harshly to them” – it teaches that he became like a stranger [<i>nokhri</i>] to them. He took the goblet and struck it. He said to them: ‘I see in my goblet that “you are spies.”’ They said to him: ‘“We are sincere”; however, this is what our father commanded us: Do not enter through one gate…’ He said to them: ‘What is the nature of your presence in the marketplace of harlots? Were you not afraid of the evil eye? Was that not your father’s command?’ They said to him: ‘We lost something and we were seeking it there.’ He said to them: ‘What was the lost item? I see in my goblet that two of you destroyed the big city of Shekhem, and then you sold your brother to Arabs.’ Immediately, they were shocked and said to him: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, sons of…our father.” He said to them: ‘And where are the other two?’ They said to him: “One is absent” – dead; and “the youngest is with our father today.” He said to them: “Bring your youngest brother to me…” (Genesis 42:34). He took Simeon and incarcerated him before their eyes, because it was he who had pushed him into the pit. He separated him from Levi, so they would not conspire against him. <br>Simeon said to his brothers: ‘So you did to Joseph, and so you seek to do to me?’<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">You also sinned in the sale of Joseph. Do not leave me here; stay and bear the burden of punishment together with me (Maharzu). </i> They said to him: ‘What shall we do?

Now, I will see who will take me into prison.’<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Shimon planned to resist being taken to prison. </i> At that moment, Joseph sent to Pharaoh and said to him: ‘Send me seventy of your mighty men, as I have found robbers and I seek to shackle them.’ At that time he sent them to him, and Joseph’s brothers were looking to see what he sought to do.  <br>Joseph said to those mighty men: ‘Take him into prison.’ When they drew near to him, he screamed at them. When they heard his voice, they fell on their faces and their teeth broke, as it is stated: “The roar of the lion and the voice of the great cat, and the teeth of the lion cubs are broken” (Job 4:10). Manasseh was sitting before his father. His father said: ‘You get up.’ Immediately, Manasseh stood and struck him with one blow, took him into prison, and shackled him. [Joseph] said to [his brothers]: ‘This one will be incarcerated until you bring your brother “and your statements will be verified”’ (Genesis 42:20). <br>Immediately, “Joseph commanded and they filled their vessels” (Genesis 42:25). They went to their father and related to him the entire incident.

“Joseph saw his bothers [and he recognized them, but he acted as a stranger to them]” (Genesis 42:7) – Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya said: He became like a stranger to them. <br>“Joseph recognized his brothers…” (Genesis 42:8) – Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis, Rabbi Levi said: When they fell into his hands: “Joseph recognized his brothers.” When he fell into their hands: “But they did not recognize him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">He treated them as brothers when they descended to Egypt; they did not treat him as a brother when he came to them in Dotan.</i> The Rabbis say: He parted from them when they were bearded, so “Joseph recognized his brothers.” “But they did not recognize him,” as they parted from him when he was not bearded. <br>“Joseph remembered…and said to them…[They said to him:] We are all the sons of one man” (Genesis 42:9–11) – they had a spark of the Divine Spirit.

<b>“And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, and he will send with you your other brother and Benjamin; and me, as I am bereaved, I am bereaved” (Genesis 43:14).</b> <br>“And may God Almighty grant you mercy” – Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori began: “Happy is the man whom You chastise, Lord” (Psalms 94:12). And if he resents it – “You instruct him from Your Torah” (Psalms 94:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">He can learn from the Torah that God-given chastisement in this world is for his ultimate benefit. </i> What is written regarding Abraham? “[Go for yourself from your land…to the land that I will show you.] And I will bless you and I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:1–2) – when he departed, he encountered famine and he did not object and did not protest.

Happy is the man whom suffering befalls through the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">His allotment of suffering is met through his exertion in Torah study (<i>Nezer HaKodesh</i>). </i> as it is stated: “You instruct him from Your Torah.” Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: All suffering that befalls a person and causes him to be idle from Torah matters, is suffering of rebuke, but suffering that befalls a person and does not cause him to be idle from Torah matters, is suffering of love, as it is written: “For whom the Lord loves, He rebukes” (Proverbs 3:12). <br>Rabbi Ḥama saw a certain blind person sitting and toiling in Torah. He said to him: ‘Greetings, free man.’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥama]: ‘From where did you hear that this man<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to himself.</i> is the son of slaves?’ He said to him: ‘No, [that was not my intention,] but rather that you are a free man in the World to Come.’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">You will be free of sin because of your great dedication to Torah study under difficult circumstances. </i> Rabbi Yudan said: It is written: “If he shall dislodge the tooth of his slave or the tooth of his maidservant, he shall send him to freedom” (Exodus 21:27) – if due to these, which are not the person’s entire body, but rather, one of his limbs, the Torah said: “He shall send him to freedom,” one for whom suffering afflicts his entire body, all the more so. <br>Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya: “Happy is the man whom You chastise, Lord” is not written here,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“Lord” is not written as the Tetragrammaton. </i> but rather, “whom You chastise, Lord [<i>Yah</i>]” – one who is sentenced before the judge screams and is aggrieved, and says: ‘<i>Ya</i>,<i> ya </i>– enough [<i>dai</i>], enough!’ So, Jacob said: ‘He who is destined to say enough [<i>dai</i>] to suffering, let Him say enough to my suffering,’ as it is stated: “And may God Almighty [<i>Shadai</i>] grant you mercy before the man….”
“For this, let every pious man pray [at the time of searching]” (Psalms 32:6) – Zavdi ben Levi, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and Rabbi Yosei bar Patron, the three of them recited [some of] the following verses when they died.

Another said: “You prepare a table before me” (Psalms 23:5); “But let all who put their trust in You rejoice…” (Psalms 5:12). Another said: “For one day in Your courtyard is better” (Psalms 84:11); “for Your kindness is better than life” (Psalms 63:4). Some say: “How great is your goodness” (Psalms 31:20). <br>Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya: The Holy One blessed be He, <as it were>, took the legs of our patriarch Jacob and stood them on the sea and said to him: ‘See the miracles that I am performing with your descendants.’ That is what is written: “When Israel departed from Egypt” (Psalms 114:1) – Israel the elder. Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rav Aḥa: He stood the feet of the patriarchs, too, on the sea. That is what is written: “He performed wonders before their fathers” (Psalms 78:12). “At the time of searching [<i>le’et metzo</i>]” (Psalms 32:6) – at the time of completion [<i>mitzui</i>] of the day; at the time of completion of the judgment; at the time of completion of the soul; at the time of completion of the accounting.

That is what is written: “They drank, and became inebriated with him” – with him, they drank, but other than with him, they did not drink.

One time, Rabbi Meir went and was received there. [The innkeeper] arose and donned his garments and he said to him: ‘Arise and go on your way, as I will arrange a caravan to accompany you.’ He said to him: ‘I have a brother, and I am sitting and waiting for him.’ He said to him: ‘Where is he?’ He said to him: ‘In the synagogue.’ He said to him: ‘What is his name? I will go and call him.’ He said to him: ‘Ki tov.’ That entire night, that innkeeper shouted at the entrance of the synagogue: ‘Ki tov, Ki tov,’ but no one answered him. In the morning, Rabbi Meir rose and bridled his donkey in order to depart. The innkeeper said to him: ‘Where is that brother of whom you spoke?’ He said to him: ‘He has arrived: “God saw the light, that it was good [<i>ki tov</i>]”’ (Genesis 1:4).

Chapter 93

<b>“Judah approached him, and said: My lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not become incensed with your servant, as you are like Pharaoh” (Genesis 44:18).</b> <br>“Judah approached him, and said: Please my lord, may your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not become incensed with your servant, as you are like Pharaoh.” “My son, if you became a guarantor for your friend… you have been snared by the sayings of your mouth…Do this [and be delivered]…” (Proverbs 6:1–3) – Rabbi Ḥanina said: Flee from three things, and adhere to three things: Flee from deposits,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to one who deposits an object with someone for safekeeping. </i> from refusals,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If a girl has been orphaned of her father, the Rabbis instituted a rule that her mother and brothers can accept a betrothal on her behalf. It is betrothal by rabbinic law, and she has the right to refuse to remain in this relationship when she reaches age twelve.

Adhere to <i>ḥalitza</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If a married man dies without children, it is a mitzva for the man’s brother to marry his widow in a levirate marriage. If he refuses, the widow performs <i>ḥalitza</i>, in order to dissolve the levirate bond.</i> to nullification of vows, and to introducing peace between one person and another. Rabbi Berekhya said that Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said: Its name is not a deposit [<i>pikadon</i>], but rather, <i>puk don </i>– take this out.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Do not allow a deposit into your house. </i> <br>Another matter, “my son, if you became a guarantor for your friend” – this is Judah, [as it states]: “I will guarantee him” (Genesis 43:9). “If you have shaken your hands for a stranger”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">By which you are agreeing to become a guarantor.</i> (Proverbs 6:1) – “from my hand you can demand him” (Genesis 43:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash relates Judah’s acceptance of responsibility for Benjamin, “from my hand you can demand him,” to the statement in the verse in Proverbs about shaking hands when becoming a guarantor. </i> “You have been snared by the sayings of your mouth” – “if I do not bring him to you” (Genesis 43:9). “Do this, then, my son, and be delivered” (Proverbs 6:3) – go and cleave to the dust of his feet and accept his kingdom and lordship – “Judah approached him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">According to this, Judah approached Joseph in order to kiss his feet and accept his kingship (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i>
“Behold, the kings convened, passed together” (Psalms 48:5). “Behold the kings” – this is Judah and Joseph. “Passed [<i>avru</i>] together” – this one became filled with fury [<i>evra</i>] against that one, and that one became filled with fury against this one.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph and Judah became angry with one another. </i> “They saw it and were astonished” (Psalms 48:6) – “The men wondered to one another” (Genesis 43:33). “They were terrified; they hastened” (Psalms 48:6) – “[Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live?] And his brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). “A fearful trembling seized them there” (Psalms 45:6) – these are the tribes. They said: ‘Kings are contending with one another; of what concern is it to us?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The other brothers felt it was not their place to intervene in the confrontation between Joseph and Judah. </i> It is appropriate for a king to contend with a king.’  <br>“Judah approached him” – “One approaches another” (Job 41:8) – this is Judah and Joseph. “Not even a breath comes between them” (Job 41:8) – these are the tribes. They said: ‘Kings are contending with one another; of what concern is it to us?’
Another matter, “Judah approached him.” It is written: “Like golden apples in silver ornaments [is a well-turned phrase]” (Proverbs 25:11) – Akilas the proselyte translated: Golden apples in silver bowls. “A well-turned phrase [<i>davar davur al ofanav</i>]” – just as the wheel [<i>ofan</i>] shows its face on all sides, so, Judah’s words were deemed logical to all parties when he spoke with Joseph.
Another matter, “Judah approached him.” It is written: “Like deep water is counsel in the heart of a man…” (Proverbs 20:5) – this is analogous to a deep well filled with cold water; its water was cold and good, but no person could drink from it. Someone came and tied rope to rope, thread to thread, and cord to cord, and he drew from it and drank. Everyone began drawing from it and drinking. So, Judah did not relent from responding to Joseph regarding each and every matter, until he touched his heart.
Another matter, “Judah approached him.” “Behold, days are coming, the utterance of the Lord, and the plowman will encounter [the reaper]…” (Amos 9:13); “plowman” – this is Judah;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Hosea 10:11.</i> “the reaper” (Amos 9:13) – this is Joseph, as it is stated: “Behold, we were binding sheaves” (Genesis 37:7). “And the treader [<i>dorekh</i>] of grapes” (Amos 9:13) – this is Judah; “For I will bend [<i>darakhti</i>] Judah as a bow for Me” (Zechariah 9:13). “The sower of seed [<i>bemoshekh hazara</i>]” (Amos 9:13) – this is Joseph, who drew the offspring [<i>shemashakh zaro</i>] of his father, and caused him to descend to Egypt, as it is written: “With ropes of man, I would draw them” (Hosea 11:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The “rope” that drew Jacob to Egypt was a man, namely Joseph. </i> “The mountains will drip nectar” (Joel 4:18)<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages often view mountains as metaphors for the righteous.

They said: ‘Kings are contending with one another; of what concern is it to us?’
Another matter, “Judah approached [<i>vayigash</i>] him” – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yehuda says: An approach for war, just as it says: “Yoav and the people who were with him advanced [<i>vayigash</i>] to the battle” (II Samuel 10:13). Rabbi Neḥemya says: An approach for conciliation, just as it says: “The children of Judah approached Joshua” (Joshua 14:6) – to placate him.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Members of the tribe of Judah sought to placate Joshua so that he would grant Caleb’s request.</i> The Rabbis say: An approach for prayer – “Elijah the prophet approached, and he said: Lord, God of …” (I Kings 18:36). Rabbi Elazar resolved it in accordance with all of them: If [I must engage in] war, I am coming; if [I must engage in] conciliation, I am coming, if [I must engage in] prayer, I am coming. <br>“Please my lord [<i>bi adoni</i>]” (Genesis 44:18) – [take] me [<i>bi</i>] and not him [<i>bei</i>] – whether it is to fill water, it is I; for service, it is I; to split logs, it is I.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Judah was telling Joseph that he would be a better servant than Benjamin, and therefore Joseph should take him and not Benjamin. </i> <br>Another matter, “Please my lord [<i>bi adoni</i>]” – injustice [<i>baya</i>] you are bringing upon us, my lord, as so you said to us: “Bring him down to me, [and I will set my eye upon him]” (Genesis 44:21); is this the setting of an eye? It is the opposite of what you said: It is blindness of the eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">You obscured the truth from us.</i> <br>Rabbi Simon said:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is an explanation of Judah’s argument that Joseph was acting unjustly in demanding that Benjamin become his slave. </i> It is written in our law books: “If he has nothing, he shall be sold for his theft” (Exodus 22:2), but this one has the means to pay. <br>“May your servant please speak [a word in my lord's ears]” – may my words enter your ears. This one’s grandmother, because Pharaoh abducted her for one night, he and his household were stricken with leprosy, as it is written: “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh [and his household with great afflictions over the matter of Sarai, Abram’s wife]” (Genesis 12:17), take care that this person<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to Joseph himself.</i> will not be stricken with leprosy.

Just as Pharaoh lusts after males, so, too, do you. Just as Pharaoh is king and you are second to him in the land of Egypt, so, too, my father is king in the land of Canaan and I am second to him. If I draw my sword, I will begin with you and conclude with Pharaoh your master. Had he said: ‘I will begin with Pharaoh,’ [Joseph] would have left him alone. Since he said: ‘I will begin with you,’ [Joseph] signaled to Manasseh, who stamped one foot and the entire palace quaked. [Judah] said: ‘This is a stamp from Father’s household.’<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">No one but members of Jacob’s family were so powerful. </i> When he saw that matters were thus,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">When Judah saw he would not be able to overpower Manasseh (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> he began speaking gentle words – “my lord asked” (Genesis 44:19).
Another matter, “Judah approached him” – this is what was stated through the Divine Spirit by Solomon: “Wisdom will fortify the wise [more than ten rulers who were in a city]” (Ecclesiastes 7:19). Corresponding to whom did Solomon say this verse? He said it only corresponding to Joseph the righteous. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When Joseph the righteous seized Benjamin and said to his brothers: “The man in whose hand the goblet was found, he shall be my slave [and you, go up in peace to your father]” (Genesis 44:17), Judah said to him: ‘Benjamin, you are seized; can there be peace in Father’s household?’ Immediately, Judah grew angry and roared in a loud voice. His voice traveled four hundred parsangs, until Ḥushim son of Dan heard and leapt from the land of Canaan and came to Judah. Both of them roared and the land of Egypt was on the verge of being upended. In their regard Job said: “The roar of the lion and the voice of the great cat” (Job 4:10). “The roar of the lion” – this is Judah, in whose regard it is written: “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9). “And the voice of the great cat” – this is Ḥushim son of Dan, as both of them were likened to a lion, as it is stated: “To Dan he said: Dan is a lion cub” (Deuteronomy 33:22). “The teeth of the young lions are broken” (Job 4:10) – these are Joseph’s warriors. When Judah grew angry, the teeth of all of them fell out. <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When [the brothers] saw that Judah grew angry, they too, were filled with anger. They kicked the ground and caused it to be full of furrows, as it is stated: “The lion perishes for lack of prey” (Job 4:11) – this is Judah, who risked his life on Benjamin’s behalf. He said: ‘Perhaps, the Holy One blessed be He will forgive me for that iniquity of misleading my father and saying: I will bring him to you.’<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Judah had guaranteed to return Benjamin, who was now being seized by Joseph. Judah was willing to risk his life in order to attempt to fulfill that guarantee, thinking that even if he was unsuccessful, perhaps he would at least not be held accountable for the sin of failing to fulfill his guarantee (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). Alternatively, it had been Judah who had misled Jacob about Joseph’s disappearance and caused him to think that Joseph was dead (Maharzu). </i> At that moment he became filled with rage at Joseph. When Joseph saw the signs of Judah’s [rage], he was immediately shaken and alarmed. He said: ‘Woe is me, perhaps he will kill me.’  <br>What were the signs [of rage] upon Judah? Those of the house of Shilo said: Blood flowed from his two eyes. Some say: He would wear five garments that were like warriors’ armor. When he would grow angry, there was one hair over his heart that would rip through them all. What did Joseph do at that moment? That stone pillar upon which he was seated, he kicked it and rendered it a heap of pebbles. At this Judah was astonished and said: ‘This one is mightier than I am.’ At that moment, Judah grasped his sword and sought to draw it from its scabbard, but it would not be drawn for him. Judah said: ‘This one must be a God-fearing man; that is why it is stated: “Wisdom will fortify the wise”’ (Ecclesiastes 7:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the term wisdom in this verse as a reference to fear of God, as in Job 28:28. </i>
<b>“My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?” (Genesis 44:19).</b> <br>“My lord asked his servants…” – [Judah] said to him: ‘From the outset you came against us with malice. How many countries descended to Egypt to purchase food? But you did not ask [this of] any of them. Did we, perhaps, come to take our daughter, or are you planning to marry our sister? Nevertheless, we hid nothing from you.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘I see that you are a prattler. Is there among your brothers a prattler like you?’<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Why are you the only one of the brothers talking? According to <i>Tanḥuma </i>(<i>Vayigash</i> 5), Joseph claimed that he knew through divination that Judah was not the oldest of the brothers, and therefore it was even more surprising that he was doing all the talking. </i> [Judah] said to him: ‘All this that you see is because I became a guarantor for him.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘Why did you not do so on behalf of your brother when you sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and you brought anguish to your father and said to him: “Joseph was mauled”?’ (Genesis 37:33). When Judah heard this he screamed and cried in a loud voice.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Judah screamed and cried because Joseph was not giving in to his demand to release Benjamin. </i> He said: “For how will I go up to my father?” (Genesis 44:34). Judah said to Naphtali: ‘Go and see how many marketplaces there are in Egypt.’ He leapt and returned and said to him: ‘Twelve.’ Judah said to his brothers: ‘I will destroy three of them, and each and every one of you take one each, “and no man will be left among them”’ (I Samuel 14:36). His brothers said to him: ‘Egypt is not like Shekhem. If you destroy Egypt you will be destroying the entire world.’  <br><b>“Joseph could not restrain himself before all those standing before him, and he called: Remove every man from before me. No man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers” (Genesis 45:1). <br>“He raised his voice in weeping; the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard” (Genesis 45:2). <br>“Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him” (Genesis 45:3). <br>“Joseph said to his brothers: Please approach me, and they approached. He said: I am Joseph your brother whom you sold to Egypt” (Genesis 45:4).</b> <br>At that moment, “Joseph could not restrain himself” (Genesis 45:1). When Joseph saw that they had come to an agreement to destroy Egypt, Joseph said to himself: ‘It is preferable that I reveal myself to them and they will not destroy Egypt.’ Joseph said to them: ‘Did you not say that this one’s brother was dead? I will call him and he will come to you.’ He was calling: ‘Joseph son of Jacob, come to me. Joseph son of Jacob come to me.’ They were looking to the four corners of the palace. He said to them: ‘What are you looking for? “I am Joseph your brother”’ (Genesis 45:4). Immediately, their souls departed, as it is stated: “His brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). But they did not believe him until he uncovered himself and showed them his circumcision.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: In all the matters that you read that Judah spoke to Joseph in the presence of his brothers until you reach: “Joseph could not restrain himself,” there is conciliation for Joseph, conciliation for his brothers and conciliation for Benjamin. Conciliation for Joseph, saying: See how he is giving his life for the sake of Rachel’s sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph saw how Judah was willing to give his life for Benjamin, whereas earlier he had been one of the initiators when the brothers sold him.

Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He acted appropriately and properly. He was aware of his brothers’ righteousness. He said: ‘God forbid, my brothers are not suspected of bloodshed.’
“He raised his voice in weeping…. And his brothers could not answer him” – Abba Kohen Bardela said: Woe unto us from the Day of Judgment; woe unto us from the day of rebuke. Bilam, the wise man of the idolaters, could not withstand the rebuke of his donkey. That is what is written: “Have I been in the habit of doing so to you? He said: No” (Numbers 22:30). Joseph was the youngest of the tribes and they were unable to withstand his rebuke. That is what it is written: “And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him.” When the Holy One blessed be He will come and rebuke each and every one according to his status, as it is stated: “I would reprove you and set it before your eyes” (Psalms 50:21), all the more so. <br> “Please approach me, and they approached” – he showed them the circumcision. “I am Joseph.” <br><b>“And now, it was not you that sent me here, but God.

Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: Woe unto us from the Day of Judgment; woe unto us from the day of rebuke. If the righteous Joseph, who is flesh and blood, when he rebuked his brothers, they were unable to withstand his rebuke, the Holy One blessed be He who is Judge, Litigant, sits on the bench of judgment, and judges each and every one, all the more so, that all flesh and blood people will be unable to stand before Him.
<b>“He fell upon the neck of his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck” (Genesis 45:14).</b> <br>“He fell upon the neck [<i>tzaverei</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This Hebrew term is plural, such that a literal translation would be “necks.” </i> of his brother Benjamin, and wept” – did Benjamin have two necks? Rather, Rabbu Elazar ben Pedat said: Joseph saw through the Divine Spirit that two Temples were destined to be built in Benjamin’s portion and were destined to be destroyed. “And Benjamin wept upon his neck” – he saw that the Tabernacle in Shilo was destined to be fashioned in Joseph’s portion and was destined to be destroyed. <br>“He raised his voice in weeping” (Genesis 45:2) – just as Joseph placated his brothers only through weeping, so, the Holy One blessed be He will redeem Israel only through weeping, as it is stated: “They will come with weeping, and with supplications I will lead them” (Jeremiah 31:9).

<b>“The news was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying: Joseph's brothers have come; and it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and the eyes of his servants” (Genesis 45:16).</b> <br>“The news was heard in Pharaoh's house.” It is written: “One is my faultless dove” (Song of Songs 6:9) – this is Abraham, as it is stated: “Abraham was one” (Ezekiel 33:24). “One to her mother” (Song of Songs 6:9) – this is Isaac, who was his mother’s only son. “Pure [<i>bara</i>] to the one who bore her” (Song of Songs 6:9) – this is Jacob, as it was clear [<i>barur</i>] to his mother that he was righteous. “Girls saw her and lauded her” (Song of Songs 6:9) – these are the tribes, as it is stated: “The news was heard in Pharaoh's house…” “Queens and concubines, and praised her” (Song of Songs 6:9) – this is Joseph, as it is stated: “Can we find [a man] like this [in whom there is the spirit of God]” (Genesis 41:38).

But if they designated him for them, like Sheva son of Bikhri, they shall give, and all of them shall not be killed. Rabbi Yehuda said: In what case are these matters stated? It is when he is inside and they are outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">When he is trapped by the besieging army but they are not totally trapped, it is possible they will escape the army even if they do not deliver him to the army. Consequently, they may not turn him over. </i> But if he is inside and they are inside, since he will be killed and they will be killed, they shall deliver him to them and all of them will not be killed. Like it says: “The woman came to all the people” (II Samuel 20:22) – since he will be killed and you will be killed, give him to them and let you all not be killed. Rabbi Shimon says: Anyone who revolts against the kingdom of the house of David is liable to death.  <br>Ulla ben Kishar was sought by the empire. He rose and fled to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to Lod. They sent a messenger after him. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi approached [Ulla ben Kishar] and appeased him. He said to him: ‘It is preferable that this man [i.e. you] be killed, and let the entire community not be punished on his account.’ He appeased him and he delivered him to [the messenger]. Elijah was accustomed to speak with [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi]. Once he did this, [Elijah] did not come to him any longer. He fasted over him for thirty days, and he appeared to him. [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi] said to him: ‘What is the reason that my master absented himself?’ He said to him: ‘Do I associate with informers?’ He said to him: ‘Is it not a <i>baraita</i>: A group of people…’ He said to him: ‘Is that a mishna of the pious? That act should have been performed by others and not by you.’  <br>It is taught: When Nebuchadnezzar ascended to conquer Yehoyakim, he ascended and encamped at Daphne at Antioch. The Great Sanhedrin descended to greet him. They said to him: ‘Has the time arrived for this house to be destroyed?’ He said to them: ‘No, but Yehoyakim king of Judah has revolted against me. Give him to me and I will go.’ They went and said to Yehoyakim: ‘Nebuchadnezzar wants you.’ He said to them: ‘Is this how one acts? Does one disregard one life in favor of another life? Is it not so written: “You shall not hand over a slave to his master”?’ (Deuteronomy 23:16). They said to him: ‘Is this not what your ancestor did to Sheva son of Bikhri? That is what is written: “Behold, his head is cast to you over the wall”’ (II Samuel 20:21). When [Yehoyakim] did not heed them, they rose, took him, and lowered him [to Nebuchadnezzar], who dismembered him.

Chapter 95

<b>“He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to guide him to Goshen, and they came to the land of Goshen” (Genesis 46:28).</b> <br>“He sent Judah before him to Joseph.” It is written: “Wolf and lamb will graze as one, and a lion, like cattle, will eat straw” (Isaiah 65:25). Come and see that everything that the Holy One blessed be He has struck in this world, He will heal in the future. The blind will be healed, as it is stated: “Then the eyes of the blind will be opened” (Isaiah 35:5). The lame will be healed, as it is stated: “Then the lame will leap like a deer and the tongue of the dumb will sing” (Isaiah 35:6). Just as a person departs, so he returns.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">A person will return to life at the resurrection of the dead, as he was when he died. </i> If he departs blind he returns blind; [if he was] deaf, he returns deaf; [if he was] mute, he returns mute. Just as he goes [to the grave] clothed, so he returns clothed. From whom do you derive it? It is from Samuel, who was seen by Saul.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is not meant literally, as it was the woman conjurer who saw Samuel, while Saul himself did not see him (see I Samuel 28:11–14; <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 26:7). The meaning is that Saul initiated the incident in which Samuel was seen by the conjurer. </i> What did [Saul] say to the woman? “What is his appearance? She said: An old man…and he is clad in a robe” (I Samuel 28:14), as so he was clad, as it is stated: “His mother made him a small robe” (I Samuel 2:19).  <br>Why is it that just as a person departs, so he returns? It is so [people] do not say: ‘When they were alive He did not heal them; did the Holy One blessed be He heal them when they were dead and then bring them back? It seems that these are not they, but others.’ The Holy One blessed be He says: ‘If so, let these stand as they departed, and then I will heal them.’ Why? “[So that you may know and believe Me and understand that I am He;] before Me no god was formed” (Isaiah 43:10), so I will heal them. The beasts will also be cured, as it is stated: “Wolf and lamb will graze as one” (Isaiah 65:25). All will be healed, but the one who brought harm upon all will not be healed, but rather, “and a serpent, dust will be its food” (Isaiah 65:25). Why? Because he took the creations down to the dust. <br>Another matter, “wolf and lamb.” “Wolf” – this is Benjamin.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 49:27.</i> “And lamb” – these are the tribes, as it is stated: “Israel are scattered sheep” (Jeremiah 50:17). “Will graze as one” – when? It was when Benjamin descended with them, and Jacob was saying to them: “My son will not descend with you” (Genesis 42:38). When the time arrived and he descended with them, they placed him between them and were guarding him. Likewise, regarding Joseph, it says: “He lifted his eyes, and saw Benjamin” (Genesis 43:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">He was able to see him only after lifting his eyes because the brothers surrounded him.</i> “A lion” – this is Judah; “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9). “Like cattle” – this is Joseph; “A firstborn bull is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17). They were found eating together – “they sat before him…he gave gifts” (Genesis 43:33–34). That is, “and a lion, like cattle, will eat straw” (Isaiah 65:25). That is why “he sent Judah before him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This was a demonstration that Judah and Joseph were now at peace. </i>
The verse states: “The jealousy of Ephraim will cease” (Isaiah 11:13) – because Jacob our patriarch believed that Judah had killed Joseph when he brought him the tunic, as it is stated: “He recognized it, and said: My son's tunic, an evil beast devoured him” (Genesis 37:33), and an evil beast is none other than a lion.
Another matter, “he sent Judah before him.” Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Aḥa, and Rabbi Ḥanina, one said: To arrange a residence for him. And one said: To arrange an academy in which he would teach Torah matters and in which the tribes would study. Know that it is so; when Joseph departed from him, he knew at which chapter that he was teaching him he left him. When Joseph’s brothers came to him and said to him: “Joseph is still alive… his heart was faint [because he did not believe them]” (Genesis 45:26). He remembered at which chapter he left him, and said to himself: I know that it was at the chapter of the beheaded calf [<i>egla arufa</i>] that Joseph left me. He said to them: ‘If you know at what chapter Joseph left me, I will believe you.’ Joseph, too, knew at what chapter he left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons [<i>agalot</i>], as it is stated: “Joseph gave them wagons by Pharaoh’s order” (Genesis 45:21). This is to teach you that everywhere Jacob would settle he would study Torah, just as his fathers would. <br>At this point, the Torah had not been given, but it is written of Abraham: “[Because Abraham heeded My voice,] and he kept My charge, [My commands, My decrees, and My Torahs]” (Genesis 26:5) – from where did Abraham learn the Torah? Rabban Shimon says: His two kidneys became like two jugs of water and they would gush Torah. From where is it derived that it is so? As it is stated: “Even on nights [my kidneys] instruct me” (Psalms 16:7). Rabbi Levi said: He studied Torah on his own, as it is stated: “The dissembler in his heart shall have his fill from his own ways, and a good man shall be satisfied from himself” (Proverbs 14:14). Rabbi Yonatan Sar HaBira said: Abraham knew even the joining of cooked foods, as it is stated: “Because Abraham heeded…” (Genesis 26:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The end of the verse mentions “My Torahs,” in plural, implying both the written and oral Torahs. The oral Torah includes even rabbinic laws, like the joining of cooked foods [<i>eruv tavshilin</i>]. The rabbis forbade cooking on a festival day for Shabbat unless one prepares two cooked items for Shabbat before the festival day (see <i>Beitza</i> 15b).</i> <br>How old was Abraham when he recognized his Creator? He recognized his Creator at the age of forty-eight years old. Reish Lakish said: At the age of three years old, as “<i>ekev</i>” is written, the numerical value of <i>ekev</i>, and Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states “because [<i>ekev</i>] Abraham heeded My voice…” The numerical value of the word <i>ekev</i> is one hundred and seventy-two, implying that Abraham heeded God’s voice for one hundred and seventy-two years. </i> You learn from this that at age three, he recognized his Creator. He would observe the details of the Torah and would teach his children, as it is stated: “For I have loved him, [so that he will command his children and his household after him and they will observe the way of the Lord]” (Genesis 18:19). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You taught your children in this world, but in the World to Come, I, in My glory, will teach all of you the Torah,’ as it is stated: “All your children will be students of the Lord” (Isaiah 54:13).
<b>“From among his brothers he took five men, and he presented them before Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:2).</b> <br>“From among [<i>miktze</i>] his brothers he took five men” – why did the verse state “from among [<i>miktze</i>] his brothers”? It is to teach you that they were not mighty.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>katze </i>indicates those on the periphery; those who are relatively weak.</i> Who were these five men? They were Reuben, Levi, Benjamin, Simeon, and Issachar. Why did Joseph the righteous select these five men from his brothers? It is because he knew each and every mighty one among his brothers, and he acted wisely. He said: ‘If I present the mighty ones before pharaoh, he will see them and make them his warriors.’ Anyone whose name was repeated in Moses’s blessing was mighty, and anyone whose name was not repeated, was not mighty. Judah, who was mighty, his name was repeated, as it is stated: “This is for Judah, and he said: Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah” (Deuteronomy 33:7). Therefore, he did not present him before Pharaoh. Likewise Naphtali, as it is stated: “Of Naphtali he said: Naphtali” (Deuteronomy 33:23). Likewise Asher, as it is stated: “Of Asher he said: Blessed of sons is Asher” (Deuteronomy 33:24). Likewise Dan, as it is stated: “Of Dan he said: Dan” (Deuteronomy 33:22). Likewise Zebulun, as it is stated: “Of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun” (Deuteronomy 33:18). And likewise Gad – “Of Gad he said: Blessed is He who expands Gad” (Deuteronomy 33:20). That is why he did not present these before Pharaoh. The rest, whose names were not repeated, were not mighty. Therefore, he presented them before Pharaoh. That is why it is written: “From among his brothers he took.” It does not mention their names here because they were not mighty. <br><b>“Joseph said: Give your livestock, and I will give you for your livestock, if silver has run out” (Genesis 47:16).</b> <br>“Joseph said: Give your livestock…” – your horse is before me. You are exposed as a peeled onion.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">You can claim that you have no money, but not that you have nothing. I see your horses.</i> <br><Commentary: [The Egyptians said to Joseph:] They have already left us. Some of them died and some were sold.

Chapter 96

<b>“Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred and forty-seven years” (Genesis 47:28).</b> <br>“Jacob lived in the land of Egypt” – why is this portion more closed than any of the Torah portions?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Typically between Torah portions there is a nine-letter long space in the Torah scroll. Leading into the Torah portion of <i>Vayḥi</i>, which begins with this verse,<i> </i>there is merely a one letter space.</i> It is because once our patriarch Jacob died, the enslavement in Egypt began.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">As a result, the children of Israel were trapped in a state of suffering.</i> <br>Another matter, why is it closed [<i>setuma</i>]? It is because Jacob our patriarch sought to reveal the End of Days, and it was prevented [<i>nistam</i>] from him. <br>Another matter, why is it closed?

<b>“The time for Israel to die approached and he called his son, Joseph, and he said to him: Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, please place your hand under my thigh and perform kindness and truth with me; please do not bury me in Egypt” (Genesis 47:29).</b> <br>“The time for Israel to die approached.” It is written: “For I am a stranger with You, a resident, [as were all my fathers]” (Psalms 39:13). “For we are strangers before You…our days on earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope” (I Chronicles 29:15) – if only it would be like the shadow of a wall, or the shadow of a tree,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If our life is compared to a shadow, if only it could be like the shadow of a wall or tree, which stays in place and has stability.</i> but instead it is like the shadow of a bird when it is flying, as it is written: “Like a passing shadow” (Psalms 144:4). “And there is no hope” – there is no one who can hope not to die. Everyone knows and says with his mouth that he will die. Abraham said: “I am going<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">“Going” here is in the sense of dying.</i> childless” (Genesis 15:2). Isaac said: “I will bless you before the Lord before my death” (Genesis 27:7). Jacob, too, said: “I will lie with my fathers” (Genesis 47:30). When [did he say this]? When he was about to die.
“The time for Israel…approached.” It is written: “There is no person who rules the spirit to retain the spirit, and there is no dominion on the day of death” (Ecclesiastes 8:8). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi: The trumpets that Moses crafted in the wilderness, when he was tending toward death, the Holy One blessed be He sequestered them so that another would not sound it, and they would come to him, as it is written: “Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes” (Deuteronomy 31:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Moses asked that the elders be assembled; he did not merely have someone blow the trumpets, as he would have done in the past, because they had been sequestered. </i> This was to realize what is written: “There is no dominion on the day of death.” <br>Another matter, “there is no dominion on the day of death” – when Zimri performed that action,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He brought a Midyanite woman into his tent. </i> what is written there? “He went after the man of Israel into the tent” (Numbers 25:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated about Pinḥas. </i> Where was Moses? And would Pinḥas speak before Moses? Rather, it is to realize: “There is no dominion on the day of death.” Death is nothing other than an expression of lowering. Salvation was given to Pinḥas, and Moses was lowered.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Moses’s death was drawing near, and so others began to assert authority. </i> Of David, too, it is written: “King David was old” (I Kings 1:1). When he was about to die, what is written in his regard? “The time for King David [to die] approached” is not written here, but, rather, “the time for David [to die] approached” (I Kings 2:1). Jacob, too, when he was about to die, he began lowering himself before Joseph, and he said to him: “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes.” When? It was when he approached death, as it is stated: “The time for Israel to die approached.”
Reish Lakish said: [God said:] ‘As you live, you will lie down, but you will not die,’ as it is stated: “The time for Israel to die approached.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Although Jacob’s body would cease to function, he would not die. The verse cited can be more literally translated: “The days of Israel drew near to death,” implying that Jacob’s days would die, meaning he would no longer function in the physical world, but he himself would not die (Maharzu). </i> What is “approached [<i>vayikrevu</i>]”? The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The day complains against you, saying that it would stand still.’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since Jacob was supposed to die on that day, the day would not be able to end without him dying. </i> It is like a person who says: ‘So-and-so has attacked [<i>karav</i>] another.’ That is “<i>vayikrevu</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash portrays the day, as it were, submitting a claim against Jacob, that he must die on that day. </i>  <br>Everyone in whose regard it is written that the time for him [to die] approached, did not reach the days of his ancestors. “Approach” is written with regard to David – “the time for David to die approached” (I Kings 2:1). He did not reach the days of his ancestors. Of Boaz, Oved, and Yishai, the Sages said that they lived more than four hundred years, but David lived only seventy years. He did not reach the days of his ancestors; therefore “approach” is written in his regard. Amram lived one hundred and thirty-seven years, but Moses lived only one hundred and twenty years; therefore, “approach” is written in his regard: “Behold, your days are approaching to die” (Deuteronomy 31:14). And Jacob, approach is written in his regard, as he did not reach the days of his ancestors. Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years, Isaac, one hundred and eighty, and Jacob, one hundred and forty-seven. That is why “approach” is written in his regard – “the time for Israel to die approached.”
“He called his son, Joseph” – why did he not call Reuben or Judah? Reuben was the firstborn and Judah was the king, but he disregarded them and called Joseph. Why did he do so? Because [Joseph] had the capability to carry out [his request]. That is why “he called his son, Joseph” – because the hour was given to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">He was in power at the time. </i> “Please do not bury me in Egypt” – it is for your sake I descended to Egypt; it is for your sake that I said: “Now I can die” (Genesis 46:30).  <br>“Perform kindness and truth with me” – is there kindness of falsehood, that he says “kindness and truth”? Why [did he say] so? The folk saying says: If the son of your friend dies, bear with him.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is because he can repay the kindness.</i> If your friend dies, cast off.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cast off sorrow, because he cannot repay the kindness.</i> He said to him: ‘If you perform kindness for me after my death, it is a true kindness.’  <br>“Please do not bury me in Egypt” – why? Because the ultimate fate of the land of Egypt is to be stricken with lice, and they will swarm in my body. That is why “please do not bury me in Egypt.” <br>Another matter, for what reason did Jacob request not to be buried in Egypt? It was so they would not make him the subject of idolatrous worship, for just as punishment is exacted from one who worships, so is punishment exacted from the one who is worshipped, as it is written: “Against all the gods of Egypt I will administer punishments: I am the Lord” (Exodus 12:12). Likewise you find regarding Daniel, once he interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, what is written? “Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and he prostrated himself to Daniel, and said to pour out to him a meal offering and fragrances” (Daniel 2:46). But Daniel did not accept it. Why? Because just as punishment is exacted from those who worship idols, so is punishment exacted from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">From the subject of such worship. </i> Likewise you find regarding Ḥiram. Once he made himself into a god, what was his ultimate fate? It is written in his regard: “Because your heart became haughty, and you said: I am a god” (Ezekiel 28:2) – the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Behold, you are wiser than Daniel” (Ezekiel 28:3). Nebuchadnezzar sought to sacrifice to him, but he did not want it, and you make yourself a god? What was his ultimate fate? “I cast you upon the ground, I placed you before kings that they may gaze upon you” (Ezekiel 28:17). <br>Another matter, Jacob said: ‘So that the Egyptians will not merit redemption because of me. They prostrate themselves to a lamb, and I was likened to a lamb, as it is stated: “Israel is a scattered lamb” (Jeremiah 50:17), and regarding Egypt it is written: “Whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys” (Ezekiel 23:20), and it is written: “The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb”’ (Exodus 34:20). That is, “please do not bury me in Egypt.” <br>Why did all the patriarchs demand and have fondness for burial in the Land of Israel? Rabbi Elazar said: These are cryptic matters. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What are these “cryptic matters”? “I walk before the Lord in the land of the living” (Psalms 116:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The Land of Israel is the “land of the living.”</i> Our Rabbis said two matters in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: Why did the patriarchs have fondness for burial in the Land of Israel? Because the dead of the Land of Israel come to life first in the messianic era, and enjoy the messianic years. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who dies outside of the Land of Israel and is buried there, has undergone two deaths,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Death and burial.</i> as so it is written: “And you, Pashḥur, and all the dwellers in your house, will go into captivity, and to Babylon you will come, and there you will die, and there you will be buried” (Jeremiah 20:6). That is, he has undergone two deaths. That is why Jacob says to Joseph: “Please do not bury me in Egypt.” <br>Rabbi Simon said: If so, the righteous who are buried outside of the Land of Israel suffer a loss. What, then, does the Holy One blessed be He do? He makes tunnels in the ground for them and makes them like channels, and they roll along until they reach the Land of Israel. The Holy One blessed be He then places in them a spirit of life and they arise. From where is this derived? It is written: “Behold, I am opening your graves, and I will take you up from your graves, My people, and I will bring you to the soil of Israel” (Ezekiel 37:12), and then: “I will place My spirit into you and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:14). Reish Lakish said: It is an explicit verse, that once they reach the Land of Israel, the Holy One blessed be He will place a soul in them, as it is stated: “Who places a soul in the people upon it” (Isaiah 42:5). <br>There was an incident involving Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] and Rabbi Eliezer, who were walking near the gates outside Tiberias. They saw the coffin of a dead person who came from outside of the Land of Israel to be buried in the Land of Israel. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said to Rabbi Eliezer: ‘What has this one, whose soul departed outside of the Land of Israel and came to be buried in the Land of Israel, accomplished? I read in his regard: “My inheritance you rendered an abomination” (Jeremiah 2:7) during your lifetime, “and you came, and you defiled My land” (Jeremiah 2:7) after your death.’ [Rabbi Eliezer] said to him: ‘Once he is buried in the Land of Israel, the Holy One blessed be He grants him atonement, as it is written: “His earth will atone for his people”’ (Deuteronomy 32:43). <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan, when he was departing from the world, said to those who needed to tend to him: ‘Bury me in garments dyed green, not white and not black, so if I stand among the righteous we will not be shamed, and if I stand among the wicked we will not be disgraced.’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yoḥanan was not sure if he would be summoned with the righteous, who appear in white, or the wicked, who appear in black. He therefore asked to be buried in a different color so as to avoid a situation in which he was dressed in white but summoned with the wicked, which would be embarrassing, or a situation in which he was dressed in black but summoned with the righteous, which might appear as a distortion of Divine justice.</i> <br>Rabbi Yoshiya, when he was departing from the world, said to those who were standing over him: ‘Summon my disciples.’ He said to them: ‘Bury me in white garments. Why? Because I am not ashamed to greet my Creator because of my actions.’  <br>Rabbenu,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> when he was departing from the world, commanded three matters: ‘Do not move my widow from my house. Do not eulogize me in the towns in the Land of Israel. And do not allow a gentile to touch my bier; rather, let he who tended to me during my lifetime tend to me after my death.’  <br>During his lifetime, he resided in Tzippori seventeen years, and he would read in his regard: “Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years,” and Yehuda lived in Tzippori seventeen years. Rabbenu suffered from pain in his teeth for thirteen years, and all those thirteen years, no woman died in childbirth in the Land of Israel and no woman miscarried in the Land of Israel. After thirteen years, Rabbenu became angry at Rabbi Ḥiyya HaGadol. Elijah, of blessed memory, came to Rabbenu in the guise of Rabbi Ḥiyya, placed his hand on his tooth, and he was immediately healed. On the next day, Rabbi Ḥiyya came to him. He said to him: ‘Rabbi, that tooth of yours, what is its condition?’ He said: ‘From the moment you came to me yesterday, it was healed.’ At that moment, Rabbi Ḥiyya said: ‘Woe unto you, birthing mothers in the Land of Israel. Woe unto you, pregnant women in the Land of Israel.’ Nevertheless, he said to him: ‘It was not I who placed a hand on your tooth.’ Rabbenu knew that it had been Elijah of blessed memory. From that moment, Rabbi began treating Rabbi Ḥiyya with honor.

<b>“May the angel who redeems me from all evil bless the lads, and let my name and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, be called upon them, and may they proliferate like fish in the midst of the land” (Genesis 48:16).</b> <br>“May the angel who redeems me from all evil…” – Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta said: Sustenance is twice as difficult as childbirth.

Just as sustenance is [provided] every day, so too, redemption [occurs] every day. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: It is greater than redemption, as redemption is by means of an angel and sustenance is by means of the Holy One blessed be He. Redemption is by means of an angel – “may the angel who redeems me”; and sustenance is by means of the Holy One blessed be He – “You open Your hand and satisfy everything living” (Psalms 145:16). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A person’s sustenance is as difficult as the splitting of the Res Sea, as it is stated: “Who split apart the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:13), and it is written there: “He gives food to all flesh” (Psalms 136:25).  <br>“May…bless the lads” – this is Joshua and Gideon.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They were descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh, and angels appeared to them (Joshua 5:14; Judges 6:12).</i> That is what is written: “It was when Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, a man was standing opposite him.… He said: No, for I am commander of the host of the Lord; now I have come” (Joshua 5:13–14).

“I cry out to God on High” (Psalms 57:3). “I cry out to God on High” – on Rosh HaShana. “To the Almighty who completes for me” (Psalms 57:3) – on Yom Kippur, to determine which will be for God and which will go to an uninhabitable land.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As part of the Temple service on Yom Kippur, two goats were brought, and lots were drawn to determine which would be sacrificed as an offering to God and which would be brought to a barren land and pushed off a cliff, symbolically carrying off the people’s sins.

<b>“Dan will be a serpent on the road, a viper on the path, that bites a horse’s heels, and his rider falls backward” (Genesis 49:17).</b> <br>“Dan will be a serpent on the road” – just as the serpent is found among women,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">The serpent approached Eve to entice her to eat from the tree of knowledge, and did not approach Adam. </i> so, Samson son of Manoaḥ was found among women.

Just as this serpent, its venom permeates even after its death, so, “the dead whom he put to death in his death [were more than those he put to death during his life]” (Judges 16:30). <br>“That bites a horse’s heels” – “Summon Samson and let him amuse us” (Judges 16:25).

Suffering – that is what is written: “Even in the path of Your judgments, Lord, we hoped for You” (Isaiah 26:8) – this is suffering. “For Your name” (Isaiah 26:8) – this is sanctification of the Name. “And Your memory” (Isaiah 26:8) – this is the merit of the patriarchs. “The desire of the soul” (Isaiah 26:8) – this is the desire for the World to Come. Grace is through hope: “Lord, be gracious to us, we have hoped for You” (Isaiah 33:2). Forgiveness is through hope: “For forgiveness is with You” (Psalms 130:4). What is written thereafter? “I have hoped, Lord” (Psalms 130:5). Because Jacob our patriarch envisioned him and believed that salvation would arrive in his days, when he envisioned that he would die, he said: Will this one, too, die? “For your salvation, I hope, Lord.”

Chapter 99

“Why are you agitated [<i>teratzedum</i>], ridged [<i>gavnunim</i>] mountains?” (Psalms 68:17) – Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili interpreted the verse regarding mountains. When the Holy One blessed be He came to give the Torah at Sinai, the mountains were running and contending with one another. This one was saying: ‘The Torah will be given upon me,’ and that one was saying: ‘The Torah will be given upon me.’ Tavor came from Beit Elim, Carmel from Aspamya.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Some say this is Spain. </i> That is what is written: “As I live, the utterance of [the King,] the Lord…for it is like Tavor among the mountains, [and like Carmel that reaches the sea]” (Jeremiah 46:18). This one says: ‘I was summoned,’ and that one says: ‘I was summoned.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Why are you agitated…mountains…”? All of you are mountains, but all of you are <i>gavnunim</i>, just as it says: “Or a hunchback [<i>giben</i>] or a dwarf” (Leviticus 21:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These are mentioned among the list of blemishes that disqualify a priest from performing service in the Temple. The midrash links the word <i>gavnunim</i> to <i>giben</i>, such that God is understood to have told the mountains that they were blemished and unfit for the giving of the Torah. </i> Idol worship has been performed on all of your peaks.’ But Sinai, upon which no idol worship was performed, was “the mountain that God desired for His abode” (Psalms 68:17).

Nevertheless, “the Lord will surely dwell forever” (Psalms 68:17) in the eternal Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although Sinai was chosen for the giving of the Torah, the Temple was built on a different mountain, Mount Moriah. </i> <br>Rabbi Akiva interpreted the verse regarding the tribes. When Solomon said that he would build the Temple, the tribes were running and contending with one another.

All of you are tribes, all of you are righteous, but you are <i>gavnunim</i>. What is <i>gavnunim</i>? It is thieves. All of you were party to the sale of Joseph. But in Benjamin, who did not participate in the sale of Joseph, is “the mountain that God desired for His abode” (Psalms 68:17). Likewise, you find that four hundred and seventy years earlier, the sons of Koraḥ were prophesying that it was destined to be within the portion of Benjamin. That is what is written: “My soul longs, indeed it yearns, [for the courtyards of the Lord]” (Psalms 84:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The continuation of the psalm states: “They will be seen before God in Zion” (84:8), which is located in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. </i> Likewise it says: “Indeed, we heard it in Efrata…” (Psalms 132:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The previous verse states: “Until I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob,” a reference to the Temple. </i> Rabbi Yehuda says: The Temple was built in the portion of Judah, as it is written: “[That] nobleman [<i>efrati</i>] from Bethlehem of Judah” (I Samuel 17:12).

The verse states: “We found it in the fields of the forest” (Psalms 132:6) – in the portion of one who was likened to a beast of the forest. Who was likened to a beast of the forest? Benjamin, as it is written: “Benjamin is a wolf that mauls” (Genesis 49:27).

Just as the wolf snatches, so Benjamin’s land snatches its produce.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The produce grows very quickly there.</i> “In the morning it devours its prey” – this is Jericho, whose produce would ripen first. “In the evening he divides spoils” – this is Beit El, whose produce would ripen last. <br>Rabbi Pinḥas interprets the verse regarding the altar. Just as the wolf snatches, so the altar snatches the offerings. “In the morning it devours its prey” – “the one lamb you shall offer in the morning” (Numbers 28:4). “In the evening he divides spoils” – “and the second lamb you shall offer in the afternoon” (Numbers 28:4).
<b>“All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve, and this is what their father spoke to them, and he blessed them; each man in accordance with his blessing he blessed them” (Genesis 49:28).</b> <br>“All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve…” – it is already written: “And he blessed them”; why, then, does the verse state: “Each man in accordance with his blessing he blessed them”? It is because he blessed them [by comparing] Judah to a lion, Dan to a serpent, Naphtali to a doe, Benjamin to a wolf, and he then included them all and rendered them lions and rendered them serpents. Know that it is so: “Dan will be a serpent” (Genesis 49:17), and he is then called a lion. That is what is written: “Dan is a lion cub” (Deuteronomy 33:22). This is to realize what is stated: “All of you is fair, my love, and there is no blemish in you” (Song of Songs 4:7).

It is written: “He removes speech from the trusted, and takes the sense of elders” (Job 12:20). Who are the “trusted” and the “elders”? They are Isaac, Jacob, Aaron, and Moses. In Moses’s regard it is written: “In all My house he is trusted” (Numbers 12:7). Likewise, in Aaron’s regard: “The Torah of truth was in his mouth” (Malachi 2:6). But because they said: “Hear now, defiant ones” (Numbers 20:10), they were sentenced because of their speech – “therefore, you will not bring this assembly [into the land that I have given them]” (Numbers 20:12). That is, “He removes speech from the trusted.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Here the midrash interprets the verse to mean: “He removes the trusted due to speech,” meaning that God removed Moses and Aaron from their projected positions of leading Israel into the land due to their sin involving speech. </i> <br>“And takes the sense of elders” – this is Isaac and Jacob. Isaac was fond of Esau, whom the Holy One blessed be He hated, and he said to him: “Prepare delicacies for me” (Genesis 27:4), and sought to bless him and reveal the End to him.

Jacob, too, sought to reveal the End to his sons, as it is stated: “Gather, and I will tell you what will befall [you at the end of days]”; and the Holy One blessed be He concealed it from him, and he began saying: “Reuben, you are my firstborn” (Genesis 49:3). That is, “and takes the sense of elders.”
“Gather, and I will tell you” – he appointed them as elders, just as it is stated: “Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel” (Numbers 11:16). “Gather” is stated, and “assemble and hear” is stated – he informed them that they would be exiled twice. <br><b>“Reuben, you are my firstborn, my strength, and the first of my potency; greater honor and greater power.

In this exchange, Leah was considered to have respected and elevated Jacob’s bed and Rachel was considered to have denigrated it (<i>Etz Yosef</i>; see <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 98:4). </i> Because you caused it to be desecrated, you will be a pariah until Moses, in whose regard it is written: “Moses ascended” (Exodus 19:3), will come and release you and draw you near.

<b>“Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of villainy are their heritage” (Genesis 49:5). </b> <br>Reuben went out and his ears were slumped.

He said to them: ‘You were brothers for Dina, as it is written: “Two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dina’s brothers, each took his sword” (Genesis 34:25), but not brothers for Joseph, as you sold him.’ Rabbi Simlai said: In Reuben’s regard it is written: “In order to deliver him from their hand, to restore him to his father” (Genesis 37:22). Reuben was not involved in Joseph’s sale. Judah, too, said to them: “What profit [is there if we kill our brother]?” (Genesis 37:26).

That is why [Jacob] called the two of them as one. <br>“Weapons of villainy” – what are weapons of villainy? He said to them: ‘They have been stolen by you; they are not yours. They belong to Esau, in whose regard it is written: “By your sword you shall live”’ (Genesis 27:40).

<b>“Zebulun will dwell at the shore of seas, and he will be a shore for ships, and his border will be upon Sidon” (Genesis 49:13).</b> <br>“Zebulun will dwell at the shore of seas” – Zebulun preceded Issachar, although the birth of Issachar is recorded before Zebulun. Why so? It is because Zebulun would engage in commerce, and Issachar would engage in Torah, and Zebulun would come to feed him. Therefore, [Zebulun] was granted precedence. The verse said in his regard: “It is a tree of life for those who uphold it” (Proverbs 3:18). Issachar would gather [merchandise], and Zebulun would transport it on ships, sell it, and bring him all his needs. Likewise, Moses says: “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your departure” (Deuteronomy 33:18) – why?

When Jacob saw him, he said: “For your salvation, I await, Lord” (Genesis 49:18). This one will not bring salvation, which will come only from Gad, as it is stated: “Gad, a troop will slash his enemies, and he will slash their heel [<i>akev</i>]” (Genesis 49:19), [alluding] to the one who will come at the End [<i>be’akev</i>]: “Behold, I am sending Elijah the prophet to you” (Malachi 3:23), who was from the tribe of Gad.

Alternatively, the towns would become crowded with the residents of the surrounding countryside. Rather, he wanted them to eulogize him only in the big cities. </i> Do not move my widow from my house – is it not a <i>baraita</i>: A widow who said: ‘I do not wish to move from my husband’s house,’ the heirs cannot say to her: ‘Go to your father’s house and we will sustain you,’ but rather, they sustain her and provide her with residence in accordance with her standing. It is, rather, because it is typical for the <i>Nasi </i>to have all his belongings from the public, but this one, because he did not benefit from the public at all, that is why he said: ‘Do not move my widow from my house.’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s home had been provided by the public due to his position, his wife would not have been able to continue living there after his death.

Is there a threshing floor for a thorn bush [<i>atad</i>]? Rather, these were the Canaanites. It teaches that they were fit to be trampled like a thorn bush. By what merit were they spared? It is due to the kindness that they performed with Jacob our patriarch. What kindness did they perform?

“They lamented…there…” – from where is it derived that mourning is seven days? Rabbi Abba cites it from here: “He…observed mourning for his father for seven days” (Genesis 50:10), and we derive a matter [of <i>halakha</i>] from before the giving of the Torah. Reish Lakish in the name of bar Kappara cites it from here: “From the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not emerge seven days…” (Leviticus 8:33)<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the correct reading of the text references a different verse: “And from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall not emerge, that you not die, as the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you” (Leviticus 10:7). This verse, stated to Aaron and his remaining sons after the death of Nadav and Avihu, is interpreted to mean that just as they were anointed with the anointing oil for seven days, they were to observe seven days of mourning for Nadav and Avihu (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> – just as you were anointed with the anointing oil for seven days, you, too, observe for your brothers seven days. Rabbi Hoshaya cites it from here: “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall remain day and night, seven days…” (Leviticus 8:35) – just as the Holy One blessed be He observed seven days [of mourning] for His world, you, too, observe seven days [of mourning] for your brothers, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He mourned for His world for seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Before God destroyed the world with the flood, He observed seven days of mourning, alluded to in Genesis 7:10. Similarly, He commanded Aaron and his sons Elazar and Itamar to observe seven days of mourning in advance of the deaths of Aaron’s other two sons, Nadav and Avihu (see Jerusalem Talmud <i>Moed Katan</i> 3:5). </i> <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan cites it from here: “Please let her not be like a corpse” (Numbers 12:12); rather, “she shall be quarantined for seven days” (Numbers 12:14). Just as the days of quarantine are seven, so the days of mourning are seven. One of the Sages said this [statement] of Rabbi Yoḥanan before Reish Lakish, but he did not accept it. Why did he not accept it? He said: ‘There he treats it as quarantine and here he treats it as confirmed leprosy, as Rabbi Abahu came in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan and said: “Please let her not be like a corpse” – just as the days of a corpse are seven, so the days of a confirmed leper are seven.’<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Upon the appearance of certain types of leprous spots, a priest will command that the individual go into quarantine for seven days. If the symptoms worsen, the individual will then be declared to be a confirmed leper (see, e.g., Leviticus 13:1–8). Reish Lakish did not accept the teaching reported in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that treated Miriam’s leprosy as worthy of quarantine, which the Torah says is seven days, because he heard a different statement in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that treated her leprosy as a case of confirmed leprosy, about which the Torah does not explicitly say that the term is seven days. It should be noted that <i>halakha</i> does not actually limit the term of a confirmed leper to seven days, and commentaries here interpret the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan, based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Moed Katan</i> 3:5), to mean that just as the days one is impure from a corpse do not count toward the days of a nazirite vow, the same is true of the days one spends as a confirmed leper (see <i>Yefei To’ar</i>; <i>Etz Yosef</i>; Maharzu). </i> Rabbi Yirmeya and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba in the name of Reish Lakish: “I will transform your festivals into mourning” (Amos 8:10) – just as the days of the festival are seven, so the days of mourning are seven. Rabbi Ḥiyya said: The eighth<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemini Atzeret</i>.</i> is a festival in and of itself. If so, just as [Shemini] Atzeret is one day, so, mourning is so. They said to him: From here it is derived regarding distant tidings.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">One who receives tidings that an immediate relative died a long time ago (the midrash will define how much time that is), observes mourning for only one day.</i> So it is taught, near tidings have seven and thirty,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">One observes a seven day period of intense mourning, followed by a less intense period of mourning for an additional twenty-three days, for a total of thirty days of mourning. </i> a distant one does not have thirty and seven. There are some who teach: Distant tidings are after twelve months, near ones are within thirty. Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The <i>halakha </i>is in accordance with the one who says: Near tidings are within thirty days and distant ones after thirty days. <br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Yona in the name of Reish Lakish in the name of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: It is written: “The days of weeping of the mourning of Moses concluded” – days – two, weeping – seven, mourning – thirty. There are those who transpose – days – seven, weeping – two, mourning – thirty. From this, [the mourning periods of] seven and thirty [days are derived], but what is two? It is that if he [the mourner] is extremely poor, on the first and second [days] he does not perform labor, but on the third, he performs [labor] privately, but they said: May a curse come upon his neighbors, who required him to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">His neighbors should have supported him so that he could observe all seven days of mourning without performing labor. </i> Bar Kappara said: Even on the third [day] he shall not perform [labor] at all, because it is the intense period of mourning. Bar Kappara taught: The most intense time of mourning is only on the third day. For three days, the soul is hovering over its grave, believing that it will return [to the body]. When it sees that the radiance of the face has changed, it goes and leaves it. That is what is written: “But his flesh on him is painful, [and his soul mourns over him]” (Job 14:22). In the future, the mouth and the stomach will contend with one another. The mouth says to the stomach: ‘Everything that I stole and robbed, I placed in you.’ After three days [the stomach] bursts and says to it: ‘Here is everything that you stole and robbed,’ as it is stated: “The pitcher is broken at the spring” (Ecclesiastes 12:6). <br>What about donning <i>tefillin</i>? Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer says: On the first [day of mourning] one does not don, and on the second one dons, but if a new face comes,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">A visitor the mourner has not yet seen since the beginning of the mourning period. </i> he removes them. Rabbi Yehoshua says: On the first and the second he does not don and on the third he dons, and if a new face comes, he does not remove them. If on the second day he does not don, is it necessary to say: One whose deceased is laid out before him is exempt…from prayer<i> </i>and from <i>tefillin</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Berakhot</i> 3:1. </i> It is since it taught this it taught that.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Mishna taught that he is exempt from prayer, it mentioned that he is also exempt from the mitzva of <i>tefillin</i>.</i> <br>The ruling of Rabbi Ze’eira: Rabi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Ze’eira and Mar Ukva in the name of Shmuel:<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentaries assert that the text should read: Rabbi Ze’ira said in the name of Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rav, and Rabbi Ze’ira said in the name of Mar Ukva in the name of Shmuel (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> The <i>halakha </i>is in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer regarding donning, and in accordance with Rabbi Yehoshua regarding removing. Rabbi Ze’eira raised a dilemma: What is the ruling for one to don on the second day in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer and what is the ruling to have Rabbi Eliezer like Rabbi Yehoshua not to remove?<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Can one combine the leniencies of the two opinions and don <i>tefillin</i> on the second day and not remove them if a new person arrives? The midrash does not cite a resolution to this dilemma. </i> <br>From where is it derived that there is no mourning on Shabbat? Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi cites it from here: “The blessing of the Lord, it will enrich, without adding sadness with it” (Proverbs 10:22). “The blessing of the Lord, it will enrich” – “God blessed the seventh day” (Genesis 2:3). “Without adding sadness [<i>etzev</i>] with it” – this is mourning, just as it says: “The king is grieving [<i>ne’etzav</i>] over his son” (II Samuel 19:3). <br>Rav said: [On Shabbat,] turning around and righting are compulsory, uncovering and putting on are voluntary. Turning the rip around, and righting the bed are compulsory; uncovering the head and putting on shoes are voluntary.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">During the seven day mourning period, the mourner wears a torn garment and does not wear leather shoes. In Talmudic times, a mourner would also turn over his bed and cover his head as signs of mourning. Rav states that on Shabbat, one must turn the garment around so that the tear is not visible, and one must turn the bed right side up. However, although one <i>may</i> uncover the head and wear leather shoes on Shabbat, it is not obligatory to do so. </i> Shmuel said: Uncovering, turning around, and righting are compulsory; putting on, conjugal relations, and washing are voluntary. Uncovering the head, turning the rip around, and righting the bed are compulsory; putting on shoes, having conjugal relations, and washing are voluntary. One student of Shmuel engaged in conjugal relations and went and washed. [Shmuel] said to him: ‘I said it to you as the <i>halakha</i>, did I, perhaps, say [it should be put] into practice?’<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Although Shmuel held it was permitted for a mourner to engage in conjugal relations and to wash himself on Shabbat, he felt it was nonetheless inappropriate. </i> He became angry at [the student] and [the student] died. <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta would relate the praise of Rabbi Meir before the residents of Tzippori. He said to them: ‘[He is a] great man, a holy man.’ One time he [Rabbi Meir] found them standing in a line on Shabbat.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">To comfort mourners. </i> He said to [the mourners]: ‘Greetings to you.’ They said to him [Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta]: ‘Is this the one whom you praise?’<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">One is ordinarily forbidden to extend greetings to mourners, so after Rabbi Meir did so, the residents of Tzippori asked Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta how he could have praised Rabbi Meir. </i> He said to them: ‘Know how praiseworthy that man is, as he came to inform us that there is no mourning on Shabbat.’  <br>Rabbi Hoshaya went to a certain place. He found them standing in a line on Shabbat. He said to them: ‘I do not know what your custom is; nevertheless, greetings to you, in accordance with the custom of our place.’  <br>The two sons of Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi], one of them went out with his head covered and wearing shoes, and the other went out barefoot with his head uncovered.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Guryon's brother was in mourning for one of his relatives.

Shall I become an antagonist to the Holy One blessed be He; the Holy One blessed be He blesses and I diminish?’ That is what is written: “He comforted them.”  <br>The matters may be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>: If Joseph, who spoke gentle words to the heart of the tribes, was able to comfort them so, when the Holy One blessed be He will come to comfort Jerusalem, all the more so. That is what is written: “Comfort, comfort My people…” (Isaiah 40:1).
<b>“Joseph resided in Egypt, he, and his father's household; Joseph lived one hundred and ten years” (Genesis 50:22).</b> <br>“Joseph resided in Egypt…” – there are six pairs whose years were equal: Rebecca and Kehat, Levi and Amram, Joseph and Joshua, Samuel and Solomon, Moses and Hillel the elder, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and Rabbi Akiva. Moses spent forty years in Pharaoh’s palace, forty years in Midyan, and he served Israel for forty years. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai engaged in commerce for forty years, studied Torah for forty years, and served Israel for forty years. Rabbi Akiva was an ignoramus for forty years, studied Torah for forty years, and served Israel for forty years.
<b>“Joseph administered an oath to the children of Israel, saying: God will remember you, and you shall carry up my bones from here” (Genesis 50:25).</b> <br>“Joseph administered an oath to the children of Israel…” – I would think [he demanded they bring his bones to Canaan] immediately. The verse states: “[You shall bring my bones up from here] with you” (Exodus 13:19) – when you will ascend. From where is it derived that they took up the bones of all the tribes with them? As it is stated: “With you.” <br><b>“Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years. They embalmed him, and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt” (Genesis 50:26).</b> <br>“Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years. They embalmed him” – who embalmed him? Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: The physicians embalmed him. Rabbi Pinḥas said: The tribes embalmed him. That is what is written: “They embalmed him, and he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.” Who are they? “These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt” (Exodus 1:1).
Variant reading: “This is what their father Jacob spoke to them” (Genesis 49:28) is not written here, but rather, “their father.” Another man like me is destined to bless you and from the place that I concluded, he will begin, as it is stated: “This is what [their father] spoke.” When Moses stood, he began with “this,” as it is stated: “This is the blessing [that Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel with before his death]” (Deuteronomy 33:1).  <br>[Jacob] said to them: ‘I will say these blessings to you. When will they take effect? When you receive the Torah,’ as it is stated: “This is the Torah” (Deuteronomy 4:44). That is, “this is what their father spoke to them.” With that which their father Jacob concluded [in blessing] them, Moses began [blessing] them. <br>Moses said: “I gain insight from the elders, [for I uphold Your edicts]” (Psalms 119:100). Isaac, when he blessed Jacob, and said to him: “And God Almighty [will bless you]” (Genesis 28:3), with what did he conclude? “Isaac summoned Jacob” (Genesis 28:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This is called the conclusion because it was the beginning of Isaac’s concluding blessing to Jacob, after he had already blessed him in Genesis ch. 27. See also a variant reading in <i>Devarim Rabba</i> 11:1. </i> Jacob began from where his father had concluded, as it is stated: “Jacob summoned his sons” (Genesis 49:1), and he concluded when he blessed them with “this” – “this is what [their father] spoke [to them]” (Genesis 49:28). Moses began from where Jacob had concluded: “This is the blessing” (Deuteronomy 33:1). With what did Moses conclude? “Happy are you Israel” (Deuteronomy 33:29). David, too, when he came to recite a psalm, began from where Moses had concluded: “Happy is the man” (Psalms 1:1). That is, “I gain insight from the elders.” <br><b>“They came to the threshing floor of Atad, that is beyond the Jordan, and they lamented a very great and substantial lament there, and he observed mourning for his father seven days” (Genesis 50:10).</b>
“And he observed mourning for his father seven days” – why are seven [days] observed? It is corresponding to the seven days of the wedding feast. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘In this world, you were sorrowful with this righteous one and observed mourning for him for seven days. In the future world, I will transform that mourning into rejoicing, as it is stated: “I will transform their mourning into gladness, and I will console them and cheer them from their sorrow” (Jeremiah 31:13). Just as I comfort you, so I will comfort Zion and all its ruins, like the matter that is stated: “For the Lord will comfort Zion; He will comfort all her ruins; He will render its wilderness like Eden and its desert like a garden of the Lord. Gladness and joy will be found in it, thanksgiving and the sound of music”’ (Isaiah 51:3). <br> <br>
