And suddenly the Master whom you desire will come into His palace and the angel of the covenant whom you desire, behold he is coming says the Lord of Hosts. “Therefore, so said the Lord: 'I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; My house shall be built there,' says the Lord of Hosts.

Behold! Your king shall come to you. He is just and victorious; humble, and riding a donkey and a foal, the offspring of she-donkeys.” (Zechariah 9:9)
