Parasha 1



Chapter 1

<b>“The words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:1).</b><br>“The words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem.” This is what the verse said, inspired by the Divine Spirit, [written] by Solomon, king of Israel: “Have you seen a man diligent in his labor? He will stand before kings” (Proverbs 22:29). There was an incident involving Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa, who saw the residents of his city taking up vow offerings and gift offerings to Jerusalem. He said: Everyone is taking up vow offerings and gift offerings to Jerusalem; will I not take anything up? What did he do? He went out to the wilderness [outside] of his city and noticed a certain stone there. He broke it, he chiseled it, and he polished it. He said: I take it upon myself to bring it up to Jerusalem. He sought to hire laborers, and five people came before him. He said to them: ‘Will you take up this stone to Jerusalem for me?’ They said to him: ‘Give us five <i>sela</i> and we will take it up to Jerusalem.’ He sought to give it to them, but he did not have anything in his possession at that time. They left him and went on their way.<br>The Holy One blessed be He arranged for five angels [to appear] to him in the guise of men. He said to them: ‘Will you take up this stone [to Jerusalem] for me?’ They said to him: ‘Give us five <i>sela</i> and we will take your stone up to Jerusalem for you, provided that you join us [in carrying the stone] with your hand and finger.’ He joined them with his hand and finger, and they found themselves standing in Jerusalem. He sought to give them their payment but he did not find them. He entered the Chamber of the Hewn Stone<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The seat of the Sanhedrin.</i> and asked after them. They said to him: ‘It appears that ministering angels took your stone up to Jerusalem,’ and they read this verse in his regard: “Have you seen a man diligent in his labor? He will stand before kings [<i>melakhim</i>].” Read, in his regard: “He will stand before angels [<i>malakhim</i>].”<br>Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta: This is analogous to an adviser who achieved prominence in the royal palace. The king said to him: ‘Ask for whatever [you want and] I will give it to you.’ That adviser said: If I request silver, gold, or fine gems, he will give it to me; garments, he will give me. But I will request his daughter, and everything will be given to me along with his daughter. So, “In Givon, God appeared to Solomon in a nocturnal dream. God said: Ask, what shall I give you?” (I Kings 3:5). Solomon said: If I request silver, gold, and gems, He will give them to me. But I will request wisdom, and everything will be included. That is what is written: “Grant your servant an understanding heart” (I Kings 3:9). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You requested wisdom and did not request wealth, glory, or the lives of your enemies; therefore, wisdom and knowledge are given to you, and thereby, I will grant you wealth, property, and glory as well.’ Immediately, “Solomon awoke and behold, a dream” (I Kings 3:15). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The dream was upheld:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “and behold, a dream” is interpreted to mean that when Solomon awoke he understood that the dream was real and was being fulfilled.</i> A bird would tweet and he would know what it was tweeting about, a donkey would bray, and he would know what it was braying about. Immediately, “he came to Jerusalem and he stood before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, and he sacrificed burnt offerings and he prepared peace offerings and he made a feast for all his servants” (I Kings 3:15). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From here [it is derived] that one makes a feast when completing the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah includes all wisdom.</i> Immediately, the Divine Spirit rested upon him and he composed these three books: Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes; that is what is written: “The words of Kohelet, son of David.”
Another matter, “the words of Kohelet, son of David” – three prophets, because their prophecies were matters of rebuke, their prophecy is attributed to them. These are: “The words of Kohelet”; “the words of Amos” (Amos 1:1); “the words of Jeremiah” (Jeremiah 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This stands in contrast to, for example, the beginning of the book of Joel, which states: “The word of the Lord that came to Joel son of Petuel.” God does not attach His name to negative matters.</i><br>Why was his name called Jeremiah? It is because in his days, Jerusalem became desolate [<i>irmeia</i>]. Amos, why was his name called Amos? Rabbi Pinḥas said: It is because his tongue was encumbered [<i>amus</i>]. The people of his generation said: The Holy One blessed be He overlooked all His creations and rested His Divine Presence only on this stutterer with a severed tongue? Kohelet, why was his name called Kohelet? It is because his words were stated in an assembly [<i>hak’hel</i>], as it says: “Then Solomon assembled” (I Kings 8:1). Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rav Huna: One group would enter as another group was exiting, to hear Solomon’s wisdom. That is what the queen of Sheba said to him: “Happy are your people, happy are these servants of yours” (I Kings 10:8), and it is written: “There came from all the peoples to hear Solomon’s wisdom” (I Kings 5:14).<br>He was called by three names: Yedidya, Kohelet, Solomon. Rabbi Yehoshua says seven: Agur, Yakeh, Lemuel, Itiel.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to Yedidya, Kohelet, and Solomon.</i> Shmuel said: The most primary and authentic among them are Yedidya, Kohelet, Solomon. Rabbi Shmuel concedes regarding these [other] four, but they were epithets given to Solomon, and they were given to be expounded: Agur, as he was filled [<i>agur</i>] with matters of Torah. Yakeh, as he would expel [<i>heki</i>] his words, like this basin that at times is full and at times is emptied; so, Solomon, at times he studied Torah and at times he would forget it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This was when his heart strayed from following God.</i> Lemuel, as he spoke [<i>nam</i>] to God [<i>El</i>] in his heart and said: I can increase<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Horses, wives, and money, see Deuteronomy 17:16–17.</i> and not sin. Itiel, as he said: God is with me [<i>iti El</i>] and I am able.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To marry numerous women.</i><br>“Son of David” – king, son of a king, wise man, son of a wise man, a righteous man, son of a righteous man, a nobleman, son of a nobleman.<br>Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Alexandri: This ox, until its tendons are cut, it can be suspended by even one tendon. Once its tendons are cut, numerous ropes and numerous nails are needed to suspend it. So too, until Solomon sinned, he would depend on his own merit, but once he sinned, he was dependent on the merit of his fathers; that is what is written: “[However, I will not tear away the entire kingdom; I will give one tribe to your son] for the sake of David, My servant” (I Kings 11:13). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: Happy is one who was privileged to reign in a place of royalty. There it is written: “[Og, king of Bashan,] who dwelled in Ashtarot in Edre’i” (Deuteronomy 1:4), but here, “king in Jerusalem,” in a place of royalty.

Chapter 2

<b>“Vanity of vanities, said Kohelet; vanity of vanities, everything is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).</b><br>“Vanity of vanities [<i>havel havalim</i>]” – Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: David made a statement and did not explain it, but his son Solomon explained it. Solomon made a statement and did not explain it, but his father David explained it. David said: “Man is like <i>hevel</i>” (Psalms 144:4); to what <i>hevel</i> [is man compared]? If it is to the <i>hevel</i> [heat] of an oven, it has significance. If it is to the <i>hevel</i> of a stove, it has significance. His son Solomon came and explained: “Vanity of vanities [<i>havel havalim</i>], said Kohelet.” Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani taught it in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: It is comparable to a person who places seven pots on the fire one atop the other, and the heat of the upper one is insignificant.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This comparison is based on the fact that the term vanity [<i>hevel</i>] appears five times in Ecclesiastes 1:2, and twice it appears in the plural, for a total of seven mentions of the term <i>hevel</i>.</i><br>Solomon said: “For who knows what is good for man in his life, [all the days of his vain life,] that he spends like a shadow” (Ecclesiastes 6:12). What shadow? If it is like the shadow of a wall, it has substance. If it is like the shadow of a palm tree, it has substance. David came and explained: “His days are like a passing shadow” (Psalms 144:4). Rabbi Huna [said] in the name of Rav Aḥa: Like that bird that passes and its shadow passes with it. Shmuel said: Like the shadow of bees that have no substance at all.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak taught it in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: The seven vanities [<i>havalim</i>] that Kohelet mentioned correspond to the seven worlds that a person sees. A one-year-old is like a king who is on a canopied litter and everyone is hugging and kissing him. A two- or three-year-old is like a pig that extends its hands into the sewers. A ten-year-old jumps like a goat. A twenty-year-old whinnies like a horse, beautifies himself and seeks a wife. When he marries a wife he is like a donkey. When he begets children, he is as audacious as a dog to bring [home] bread and <to bring them> food. When he grows old, he is like a monkey. That is stated regarding the common people; however, regarding Torah personalities, it is written: “King David was old” – even though he was old, he was a king.<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: The seven vanities that Kohelet mentioned correspond to the seven days of Creation. On the first, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1), and it is written: “For the heavens will vanish like smoke” (Isaiah 51:6). On the second: “Let there be a firmament” (Genesis 1:6), and it is written: “The heavens will be furled like a scroll” (Isaiah 34:4). On the third: “Let the waters be gathered” (Genesis 1:9), and it is written: “The Lord will destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt” (Isaiah 11:15). On the fourth: “Let there be lights” (Genesis 1:14), and it is written: “The moon will be disgraced” (Isaiah 24:23). On the fifth: “Let the waters swarm [with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven]” (Genesis 1:20), and it is written: “I will destroy the birds of the heavens” (Zephaniah 1:3). On the sixth: “Let us make man” (Genesis 1:26), and it is written: “I will destroy man and animal” (Zephaniah 1:3). Regarding Shabbat, what do you have to say? “One who profanes it will be put to death” (Exodus 31:14). That is stated regarding one who does so intentionally; but [one who profanes it] unwittingly, he will bring an offering and gain atonement. When Adam saw the praise of Shabbat, that one who brings an offering gains atonement, he began singing in its regard to the Holy One blessed be He, praise and psalm. That is what is written: “A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat” (Psalms 92:1). Rabbi Levi said: This [psalm] was stated by Adam.

Chapter 3

<b>“What profit is there for man in all his toil that he toils under the sun?” (Ecclesiastes 1:3).</b><br>“What profit is there for man?” Rabbi Binyamin said: The Sages sought to suppress the book of Kohelet because they found in it matters that tend toward heresy. They said: All of Solomon’s wisdom that he seeks to impart is: “What profit is there for man in all his toil,” but one might [think that he meant] even in the toil of Torah. They then said: He did not say “in all toil,” but rather in his toil; in his toil he does not [profit from his] toil, but he does [profit from his] toil in the toil of Torah.<br>Rabbi Shmuel ben Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The Sages sought to suppress the book of Kohelet because they found in it matters that tend toward heresy. They said: All of Solomon’s wisdom is this statement: “Rejoice, young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes” (Ecclesiastes 11:9). Moses said: “Do not stray after your heart and after your eyes” (Numbers 15:39), and Solomon said: “And walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes.” Restraint has been abolished; there is no [divine] justice and no [Divine] Judge. When he said: “But know that for all these, God will bring you to judgment” (Ecclesiastes 11:9), they said: Solomon spoke well.<br>Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Aḥa [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥilfai: His toil is under the sun, but there is a treasure for him above the sun. Rabbi Yudan said: Under the sun he does not have [profit], but above the sun he does have [profit].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For physical toil there is no profit, but for spiritual toil there is profit.</i> Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis, Rabbi Levi said: What benefit do people who amass mitzvot and good deeds have? It is sufficient for them that I shine light upon them.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In the phrase “under [<i>taḥat</i>] the sun,” Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis interpret <i>taḥat</i> in the sense of “in exchange for.”</i> The Rabbis say: What benefit do the righteous who amass mitzvot and good deeds have? It is sufficient for them that I am destined to renew their faces [and cause them to shine] like the sun, as it is written: “But those who love Him are like the sun emerging in its might” (Judges 5:31).<br>Rabbi Yannai said: The way of the world is that when a person takes a <i>litra</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">480 grams.</i> of meat, how much trouble must he undergo and how much effort must he expend until he has cooked it! But I blow the winds for you, elevate the clouds, cause the rains and the dew to fall, grow plants and ripen them, set a table before each and every one, give each and every person all his needs, and each and every body what it lacks, and all you bring Me is the <i>omer</i>. Rabbi Pinḥas said: The way of the world is that when a person launders his garment during the rainy season, how much trouble must he undergo and how much effort must he expend until he dries it! But I blow the winds for you, elevate the clouds, cause the rains and the dew to fall, grow plants, wash them, ripen them and dry them, and set a table before each and every one, give each and every person all his needs and each and every body what it lacks, and all you bring Me is the <i>omer</i>. Rabbi Berekhya said: I am your chef, and you do not allow Me to taste the dish that I cooked to know what it needs. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: I am your guard and you do not give me from what I guarded.<br>Rabbi Elazar said: It is written: “They do not say in their heart: Let us now fear the Lord [our God, who gives the early rain and the late rain in due season]” (Jeremiah 5:24). Oh, wicked ones, do you no longer need Me?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Once the rain has come.</i> The verse states: “Who preserves for us the appointed weeks of the harvest” (Jeremiah 5:24) – He protects us from heatwaves, He protects us from harmful dews. That is what David says: “A bounteous [<i>nedava</i>] rain You will bring, God” (Psalms 68:10). If it requires rain, it is “a gift [<i>nedava</i>],” if it requires dew, “You will bring, God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Dew is ubiquitous and is therefore not called a gift.</i><br>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: It is written: “It shall be seven complete weeks” (Leviticus 23:15) -– when? It is when Yeshua and Shekhanya are not among them.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">When the first day of Nisan falls on Shabbat, the first day of Passover is on Shabbat and <i>Shavuot</i> is on Sunday. Then, the period of the <i>omer</i> is seven complete weeks, and then, the priestly watches of Yeshua and Shekhanya, the ninth and tenth of the twenty-four watches, would not serve during the <i>omer</i>. If the first of Nisan and the first day of Passover are in the middle of the week, <i>Shavuot</i> is in the middle of the week. In that case, because some of the earlier watches would serve only half a week, as on the festivals all the priests would participate in the Temple service, the watches of Yeshua and Shekhanya would serve during the <i>omer period.</i></i><br>Rabbi Abba said: Come and see how much trouble is experienced and how much effort must be expended until they bring the <i>omer</i>, as we learn: How would they perform it? Emissaries of the court would emerge on the eve of the festival [of Passover] and fashion sheaves while [the grain was still] attached to the ground, so that it would be convenient to harvest. All the adjacent towns would assemble there, so that it would be harvested with great fanfare (<i>Menaḥot</i> 65a). Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He said to you: ‘Man, you have plowed, sowed, reaped, gathered, and made several piles; if I do not produce for you a little wind, could you winnow? Yet even the fee for that wind you do not give Me.’ That is, “what is the advantage for He who toils for the wind?” (Ecclesiastes 5:15).<br>Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] made a wedding feast for his son. Rabbi invited all the Rabbis but forgot to invite bar Kappara. [Bar Kappara] went and wrote on the gate of [Rabbi’s] house: After all your rejoicing there is death; and what is the profit in your rejoicing? [Rabbi] said: ‘Who did this to us?’ They said: ‘It was bar Kappara whom, alone, you forgot to invite, and he is disgraced.’ He went and made another feast and he invited all the rabbis and he invited bar Kappara. For each and every dish that [the waiter] would place before them, [bar Kappara] would recite three hundred parables about the fox. [The parables] were very pleasant for them, and the dishes grew cold and they did not taste them. Rabbi would say to his servants: ‘Why are the dishes going in and going out and they are not tasting anything?’ They said to him: ‘Because one of the elders who is sitting there, when the dish is taken in, he says three hundred parables regarding the fox. That is why the dishes are growing cold and they are not eating anything.’ He came to [bar Kappara] and said: ‘Why are you doing this? Let the diners eat.’ [Bar Kappara] said to him: ‘It is so you do not think that I came here because of your feast, but rather, it is because you did not invite me here with my colleagues.’ Is this not what Solomon said: “What profit is there for man [in all his toil that he toils under the sun]” (Ecclesiastes 1:3), since “one generation passes and one generation comes” (Ecclesiastes 1:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">As bar Kappara wrote on the gate: What is the profit in all your rejoicing?</i> After they placated each other, they were reconciled. Abba bar Kappara said to Rabbi: ‘If, in this world, which is not yours, the Holy One blessed be He granted you serenity, in the World to Come, which is entirely yours, all the more so.’<br>Rabbi Bena’a said, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘My children, know what is the difference between Me and you.’ What is written?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to the manna that God provided for the children of Israel.</i> “An <i>omer</i> for a person; according to the number of your people…” (Exodus 16:16). But all of you give one <i>omer</i>, and not an <i>omer</i> of wheat, but rather of barley. Nevertheless, be vigilant to bring it at its appointed time; therefore, Moses cautions the children of Israel and says to them: “You shall bring the <i>omer</i>…” (Leviticus 23:10).

Chapter 4

<b>“One generation passes, and one generation comes; and the earth abides forever. The sun rises and the sun sets, and hastens its place where it rises” (Ecclesiastes 1:4–5).</b><br>“One generation passes, and one generation comes” – Rabbi Yudan says in the name of Rabbi Levi: There is no day on which six hundred thousand are not born and on which six hundred thousand do not die. What is the reason? “One generation passes, and one generation comes…the sun rises and the sun sets.” Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Yaakov bar Avuna, and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi bar Sisi: From when the sun rises until the sun sets, one generation passes, and one generation comes. From where is it derived that a generation consists of six hundred thousand? It is as it is stated: “If any man among these people, this wicked generation” (Deuteronomy 1:35), and that generation consisted of six hundred thousand. Rabbi Berekhya said: [When a] potter places [vessels] into the furnace, what he places first [he removes] last. However here, one who passes first comes first, and one who passes last comes last.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The reference here is to death and the revival of the dead.</i>
Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yaakov Gevulai [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: Like the generation that passes, so is the generation that comes. If he goes crippled, he will come [back to life] crippled. If he goes blind, he will come [back to life] blind, so they will not say, he killed others and he revived others,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It will be clear that God has revived the dead and not simply created new people.</i> as it is written: “I will kill and I will give life” (Deuteronomy 32:39). Does one who says [he will do something] difficult then say [he will even do something] easier? “I will kill and I will give life,” that is difficult, and all the more so, “I crushed and I will heal” (Deuteronomy 32:39), which is easier. Rather, ‘I will revive them with their blemishes, so they will not say he killed others and others he revived.’ “I will kill and I will give life,” “I crushed,” and then I will heal them.
Another matter, “I crushed and I will heal” – Rabbi Ḥanina in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan [said]: “I smote” is not written here, but rather, “I crushed [<i>maḥatzti</i>]” – the rift [<i>meḥitza</i>] that I established between the heavenly and the earthly, that the heavenly live and the earthly die, [holds true only] in this world. But in the World to Come there is no death at all, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). Rabbi Abba said [the verse means]: ‘That rift, too, I will then heal, <i>maḥatzti</i>, <i>meḥitzati</i> [My rift] I will heal.’
Rabbi Abba bar Kahana [said], and some say it in the name of Rabbi Ada bar Ḥunya: The generation that comes should be in your eyes like the generation that has passed, so you should not say: ‘Were Rabbi Akiva alive, I would study Bible before him; were Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Yoḥanan alive, I would study Mishna before them.’ Rather, the generation that comes during your lifetime and the Sage that is in your lifetime are the equivalent of the generation that passed and the early Sages who preceded you.<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is written: “The Lord who made Moses and Aaron…” (I Samuel 12:6), and it is written: “The Lord sent Yerubaal, Bedan, Yiftaḥ and Samuel” (I Samuel 12:11). Yerubaal, this is Gideon; Bedan, this is Samson; Yiftaḥ as its plain meaning. And it is written: “Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call His name” (Psalms 99:6) – the verse parallels three of the insignificant people of the world to three of the prominent people of the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in I Samuel (12:11) refers to Gideon, Samson, and Yiftah in the same listing as Samuel, thus equating them, and the verse in Psalms is understood to equate Samuel to Moses and Aaron.</i> to teach you that Yerubaal’s court is as great and significant before the Holy One blessed be He as Moses’s court; Samson’s court is the equivalent of Aaron’s court; and Yiftaḥ’s court is the equivalent of Samuel’s court. This teaches you that anyone who is appointed a leader of the community, even if he is extremely insignificant, he is like the noblest of their noble predecessors, as it is stated: “You shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who will be in those days…” (Deuteronomy 17:9). I have [the ability to come] only to the judge that is in your generation; where [would you be able to find] the judge that is not in your generation? Why does the verse state: “To the judge who will be in those days”?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Clearly, one can go only to a judge who is in his generation.</i> It teaches that the judge in your generation, in his time, is the equivalent of the judge who was in earlier days, and so, it says: “Do not say: How was it that the former days were better than these?” (Ecclesiastes 7:10).<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: You should heed only the judge that is in your generation, as it is written: “The heads of the fathers [<i>ha’avot</i>] of the family of the children of Gilad, son of Makhir, son of Manasseh [came near and spoke before Moses and before the princes; the heads of the fathers’ [<i>avot</i>] houses of the children of Israel]” (Numbers 36:1). Rabbi Yudan said: “The fathers [<i>ha’avot</i>],” “fathers [<i>avot</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Regarding the family of Gilad, the verse uses the definite article <i>ha’avot</i>, while regarding the leaders of entire tribes, the verse writes simply <i>avot</i>, without the definite article.</i> Rather, these entered into leadership and these were removed from leadership, and that is why the verse presented then deficiently.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The heads of the families of Gilad were from the younger generation, and were entering leadership positions, whereas the tribal princes were from the older generation and were concluding their terms of leadership.</i><br>Rabbi Berekhya said: It is written: “Yehoyada was the leader of Aaron” (I Chronicles 12:28). Was Yehoyada the leader of Aaron? Rather, had Aaron been alive in the generation of Yehoyada, Yehoyada would have been greater than he was at the time.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is interpreted to mean that Yehoyada was greater than Aaron. However, that is impossible, as Aaron was in fact greater than Yehoyada. The midrash therefore explains that had Aaron been alive in the generation when Yehoyada was the leader of the priests, Aaron would have been subordinate to him and accepted his leadership despite Aaron’s personal superiority.</i> Rabbi Simai said: It is written: “Aaron and his sons were offering on the altar of the burnt offerings…” (I Chronicles 6:34). Were Aaron and his sons alive? Was it not Tzadok and his sons who were [offering these offerings]? Rather, had Aaron and his sons been alive, Tzadok would have been greater than he was at the time.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron and his sons would have accepted Tzadok’s leadership because he was the High Priest at the time.</i> Rabbi Hillel derived it from here: “The entire congregation that returned from captivity made booths, and they dwelled in the booths, as since the days of Joshua [<i>Yeshua</i>] bin Nun, to that day, the children of Israel had not done so. There was very great rejoicing” (Nehemiah 8:17). The verse compromised the honor of the deceased righteous one for the sake of so-and-so at the time.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The verses minimizes the honor of Joshua by writing his name in a deficient manner, Yeshua, instead of the common spelling of his name, Yehoshua. This is in order allude to the fact that the then leader, Ezra, had to be accorded more honor than Joshua, the great leader of the past.</i> The Rabbis derive it from here: “The son of Avishua, son of Pinḥas ben Elazar, [son of Aaron the priest, the chief;] he, Ezra, ascended from Babylon…” (Ezra 7:5–6). Rather, had Aaron been alive, Ezra would have been greater than he was at the time.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The simple reading of the verse is that the word chief refers to Aaron, and thus identifies him as the High Priest. The midrash reads the verse as though the word chief refers not to Aaron but to Ezra, because he was the leader in his generation.</i>
“And the earth abides forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: The verse should have said only: “The earth passes and the earth comes, but the generation abides forever.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This would indicate that the earth is transient, and the people last forever.</i> Which was created for the sake of the other, was the earth created for the sake of the generation, or was the generation created for the sake of the earth? Was it not the earth [that was created] for the sake of the generation? Rather, because the generation did not perform the duties [assigned to it by] the Holy One blessed be He; therefore, it wastes away. The earth, because it performs the duties [assigned to it by] the Holy One blessed be He; therefore, it does not waste away.<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: It is written: “For like the days of the tree will be the days of My people” (Isaiah 65:22). Tree means nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life for those who grasp it” (Proverbs 3:18). Which was created for the sake of the other; the Torah for the sake of Israel, or Israel for the sake of the Torah? Was it not the Torah [that was created] for the sake of Israel? Rather, the Torah that was created for the sake of Israel exists for ever and ever; Israel, for whose sake [everything] was created, all the more so. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A kingdom enters and a kingdom leaves, but Israel stands forever; that is: “The earth abides forever.” Rabbi Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Pelatya of Naveh derived it from this verse: “Yehonatan son of Gershom son of Menashe, he and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the day of the exile of the land” (Judges 18:30). Does a land go into exile or wander? Rather, these are Israel, who are called land, as it is stated: “All nations will praise you; as you will be a land of delight” (Malachi 3:12) – you will be called a land of delight.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: Everything that the Holy One blessed be He created in man, He created its parallel for the earth. Man has a head and the earth has a head [<i>rosh</i>], as it is stated: “[He had not yet made earth and fields, or] the beginning [<i>rosh</i>] of the dust of the world” (Proverbs 8:26). Man has eyes [<i>einayim</i>] and the earth has eyes, as it is stated: “They will cover the face [<i>ein</i>] of the earth” (Exodus 10:5). A person has ears and the earth has ears, as it is stated: “Listen, earth” (Isaiah 1:2). Man has a mouth and the earth has a mouth, as it is stated: “The earth opened its mouth” (Numbers 16:32). Man eats and the earth eats, as it is stated: “A land that consumes its inhabitants” (Numbers 13:32). Man drinks and the earth drinks, as it is stated: “[But the land]…by the rain of the heavens it drinks water” (Deuteronomy 11:11). Man vomits and the earth vomits, as it is stated: “So the land will not vomit [you out]” (Leviticus 18:28). Man has hands and the earth has hands [<i>yadayim</i>], as it is stated: “The land is spacious [<i>raḥavat yadayim</i>]” (Genesis 34:21). Man has thighs and the earth has thighs [<i>yerekhayim</i>], as it is stated: “I will gather them from the ends [<i>miyarketei</i>] of the earth” (Jeremiah 31:8). Man has a navel [<i>tabbur</i>] and the earth has a navel, as it is stated: “Dwellers in the middle of [<i>betabbur</i>] the earth” (Ezekiel 38:12). Man has nakedness and the earth has nakedness, as it is stated: “To see the nakedness of the land you have come” (Genesis 42:9). Man has feet and the earth has feet, as it is stated: “And the earth abides [<i>omadet</i>] forever” (Ecclesiastes 1:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>omadet</i> literally means standing, implying that it has feet.</i><br>What is <i>omadet</i>? <i>Ma’amedet</i>. Rabbi Aḥa and the Rabbis, Rabbi Aḥa said: It fulfills [<i>ma’amedet</i>] its duties. The Rabbis said: It produces [<i>ma’amedet</i>] its food. Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakoneya said: Because in this world a person builds a building and another spends time in it, [a person] plants a sapling and another eats [its produce]. But in the future, they will not build and another will settle, they will not plant and another will eat, as it is stated: “For like the days of the tree will be the days of My people, and My chosen will outlive their handicraft” (Isaiah 65:22).

Chapter 5

<b>“The sun rises and the sun sets, and it hastens to its place where it arises” (Ecclesiastes 1:5).</b><br>“The sun rises.” Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Kahana: Don’t we know that “the sun rises and the sun sets”? Rather, to what is it [alluding]? Before the sun of one righteous individual sets, He causes the sun of another righteous individual to rise. The day that Rabbi Akiva died, Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] was born, and they read this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” The day that Rav Ada bar Ahava died, Rav Hamnuna his son was born, and they read in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” The day that Rav Hamnuna died, Rabbi Avin his son was born, and they read in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” The day that Rabbi Avin died, Abba Hoshaya of Teraya was born, and they read in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” Before the sun of Sarah set, the sun of Rebecca rose. That is what is written: “Betuel begot Rebecca” (Genesis 22:23), and then, “Sarah died in Kiryat Arba” (Genesis 23:2), and it is written: “Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah” (Genesis 24:67).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 60:16, where this verse is interpreted to mean that Rebecca was a worthy replacement for Sarah.</i> Before the sun of Moses set, the sun of Joshua rose. Before the sun of Joshua set, the sun of Otniel, who is Yabetz, rose. So it is with all of them in each and every generation; that is, “the sun rises and the sun sets.”
It is taught in the name of Rabbi Natan: The sphere of the sun has a pouch; that is what is written: “He set a tent for the sun in them” (Psalms 19:5). There is a pool of water before it. When [the sun] seeks to emerge, it becomes enflamed, and the Holy One blessed be He weakens its strength with water so it will not incinerate the world. But in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will strip it from its pouch, expose it, and incinerate the wicked with it, as it is stated: “For, behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, [and all the criminals and all those who do evil will be straw; the day that is coming will burn them]” (Malachi 3:19). Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Yishmael, both of them say: There is no Gehenna in the future; rather, the sun will emerge. The righteous will benefit from it. From where [is this derived]? It is as it is stated: “It will rise for those who fear My name, a sun of righteousness with healing in its wings” (Malachi 3:20). And the wicked will be punished with it, as it is stated: “The day that is coming will incinerate them” (Malachi 3:19).

Chapter 6

<b>“The wind goes to the south, and turns to the north; around and around the wind turns, and on its rounds the wind returns” (Ecclesiastes 1:6).</b><br>“The wind goes to the south, and turns to the north.” It “goes to the south” during the day, “and turns to the north” at night. “Around and around the wind turns, and on its rounds the wind returns” – toward the east and the west. “And on its rounds the wind returns” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said: This wind, when it emerges into the world, the Holy One blessed be He weakens it in the mountains and breaks it on the hills, and He says to it: ‘Be careful that you do not harm My creations.’ What is the reason? “Because the wind, from before Me <i>ya’atof</i>” (Isaiah 57:16) – [I] make it faint, as it is stated: “When my soul was faint [<i>nitatef</i>] within me” (Jonah 2:8). Why to that extent? Because “and souls I have made” (Isaiah 57:16).<br>Rabbi Huna said: In three places the wind emerged disproportionately, and the wind sought to destroy the entire world with all its inhabitants: Once in the days of Job, once in the days of Elijah, and once in the days of Jonah. Once in the days of Job, as it is stated: “And behold a great wind came from across the wilderness [and smote the four corners of the house]” (Job 1:19). Once in the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “Behold, the Lord passed, and a great and strong wind, smashing mountains and breaking rocks” (I Kings 19:11). And once in the days of Jonah, as it is stated: “The Lord cast a great wind upon the sea” (Jonah 1:4). Rabbi Yehuda bar Shalom said: That wind that was during the days of Job was in the world only for that house alone. That of Jonah was in the world only for that ship alone. You do not have one that was worldwide other than that of Elijah, as it is stated: “He said: Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord” (I Kings 19:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase indicates that the wind was everywhere, as the entire world is “before the Lord” (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Tanḥum [said], and some say it in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The messianic king will never come until all the souls that entered His mind to be created will live, and these are the souls that are stated in the book of Adam the first man, as it is stated: “This is the book of the descendants of Adam” (Genesis 5:1).

Chapter 7

<b>“All the rivers go to the sea, yet the sea is not full; to the place that the rivers go, they go there again” (Ecclesiastes 1:7).</b><br>“All the rivers go to the sea,” and from where does the earth drink?<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Which waters are provided to the earth in the form of rain?</i> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer says: It drinks from the water of the ocean, as it is stated: “A mist went up from the earth [and watered the entire face of the ground]” (Genesis 2:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, it is water from the earth that turns to vapor and then falls as rain.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: ‘Isn’t the water of the ocean salty?’ He said to him: ‘They are sweetened in the clouds, as it is written: “Which the skies pour down” (Job 36:28). Where do they become what pours down? It is in the skies.’ Rabbi Yehoshua says: [The earth] drinks from the upper waters, as it is stated: “From the rain of the heavens you drink water” (Deuteronomy 11:11). The clouds ascend from the earth to the heavens and receive [the water] as though from the mouth of a bottle, as it is written: “Which distill rain to His mist” (Job 36:27). They separate them like a sieve and one drop does not touch another, as it is written: “The amassing of water, thick clouds of the skies’ (II Samuel 22:12). Why does it call them skies [<i>sheḥakim</i>]? It is because they crush [<i>shoḥekin</i>] the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Separating the water into separate drops.</i> Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Like an omasum.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The third stomach in the animal that grinds the food.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Like the intestines of an animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">That crush the food.</i> It is as Rabbi Yehoshua said: A day of rainfall is great, as it is equivalent to the entire act of Creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion that rainwater is from the upper waters in the heavens, which comes to earth, is consistent with his statement that this process is an act equivalent to Creation itself (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> What is the reason? “Who performs great things beyond scrutiny and wonders beyond number” (Job 9:10); with what? “Who gives water on the face of the earth…” (Job 5:10).
How did the earth drink?<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Before there was rain, as described in Genesis 2:6.</i> Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Simon, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda says: Like the Nile, which waters [the land] and then waters it again.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">It periodically overflows its banks, watering the surrounding land.</i> Rabbi Simon said: It is like a box, like the Kavriel [River], whose [water] rises and is [then] absorbed into the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The water is present in the winter, and is absorbed into the earth in the summer, at which point crops are planted in the moist earth and are harvested before the river reappears the following winter (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> The Rabbis say: It is like the Tevaha <a river in Babylon called Tevaha>. Why is it called Tevaha? It is because it waters once every forty years,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">One would naturally be astounded [<i>toheh</i>] that this was sufficient to water the land.</i> and it is from it that the earth drank at the outset, as it is stated: “A mist went up from the earth [and watered the entire face of the ground]” (Genesis 2:6). But the Holy One blessed be He then instituted that the earth would drink only from above. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori, and some say Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori [said] in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: For four reasons the Holy One blessed be He instituted that the earth would drink only from above: Due to violent people;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Who would otherwise take all the water for themselves.</i> in order to wash away the harmful dews; so the highlands will drink like the lowlands; and so everyone will lift their eyes heavenward, as it is stated: “[Who gives rain upon the earth… to set the lowly on high…” (Job 5:10–11).
Another matter, “all the rivers go to the sea,” this is the ocean, “yet the sea is not full,” this is the ocean that is never full. There was an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua who were sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. The ship entered a place where the water does not flow. Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: We came here only for the purposes of an ordeal. They filled a barrel full with water. When they arrived in Rome, Hadrian said to them: ‘What is the nature of ocean water?’ They said to him: ‘It is water that swallows water,’ and he said to them: ‘Is it possible that all the rivers flow there and they do not fill?’ They said to him: ‘They swallow all the water in the world.’ He said to them: ‘I do not believe you until you show it to me here.’ They took the water that they had drawn from the ocean and filled a bowl with water. They poured [more] water into it and [the ocean water] swallowed [it and did not overflow]. In the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, from there they draw.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In his opinion, the clouds absorb rain water from the ocean, after which it rains into the rivers, and the rivers then flow back into the ocean. That is what is written: “To the place that the rivers go, they go there again.”</i> In the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua: “They go there again.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The rivers continually flow into the ocean, where they are swallowed by the ocean water.</i>
Another matter, “all the rivers go to the sea,” all the wisdom of a person is only in his heart. “Yet the sea is not full” – but the heart is never full. You might say that from the moment that a person removes wisdom from his heart, it will never return to him; the verse [therefore] states: “They go there again.”
Another matter, “all the rivers,” all the Torah that a person studies is only in the heart. “Yet the sea is not full” – but the heart is not full and the soul is never sated, as it is stated: “But the soul is not filled” (Ecclesiastes 6:7). You might say that from the moment that a person expresses his learning to another, it will never return to him; the verse [therefore] states: “They go there again,” as it is written: “These matters that I am commanding you today shall be upon your heart” (Deuteronomy 6:6).<br>A certain noblewoman asked Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta, she said to him: ‘What is that which is stated: “He granted wisdom to the wise [and knowledge to those with understanding” (Daniel 2:21)? The verse should have said: “He granted wisdom to the unwise, and knowledge to those without understanding.”’ He said to her a parable: ‘If two people come to you to borrow money from you, one of them wealthy and one of them poor, to which of them would you lend, to the wealthy one or the poor one?’ She said to him: ‘To the wealthy one.’ He said to her: ‘Why?’ She said to him: ‘Because if the wealthy man were to lose my money, he has [funds] with which to repay, but if the poor person were to lose my money, with what would he repay me?’ He said to her: ‘Don’t your ears hear what you utter with your mouth? Had the Holy One blessed be He granted wisdom to the foolish, they would be sitting and pontificating in its regard in bathrooms, theaters, and bathhouses. Rather, the Holy One blessed be He granted wisdom to the wise, and they sit and pontificate in its regard in synagogues and study halls. That is, “He granted wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to those with understanding.”’
Another matter, “all the rivers go to the sea,” all the converts enter only into Israel. “Yet the sea is not full,” and Israel’s number is never lacking,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Their number is not filled out by the converts, and they will not be lacking for numbers without converts.</i> as it is stated: “Who has counted the dust of Jacob” (Numbers 23:10). Perhaps you will say that anyone who does not convert in this world will convert in the World to Come; the verse states: “Behold, they may gather together [<i>gor yagur</i>]” (Isaiah 54:15),<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to converts [<i>gerim</i>], who can gather together now, but not in the future.</i> but from then on “but not by Me [<i>efes meoti</i>]” (Isaiah 54:15) – stop from being with Me [<i>hafsek me’iti</i>]. Who is with Me? He “who gathers to You” (Isaiah 54:15) in this world “will fall in with You” (Isaiah 54:15) in the World to Come. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Moreover, in the place where one converts, from there he takes his portion, as it is stated: “It will be that in the tribe where the stranger resides, [there you shall give him his inheritance, said the Lord God]” (Ezekiel 47:23).
Another matter, “all the rivers go to the sea,” – all the dead enter only the grave, but the grave is never filled, as it is stated: “The grave and oblivion are not sated…” (Proverbs 27:20). You might say that once they die in this world they do not live again in the World to Come; the verse [therefore] states: “To the place that the rivers go, they go there again” – to the place that the dead gather in the World to Come, there they return and are destined to recite songs in the messianic era. What is the reason?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">What is the source?</i> “From the ends of the earth we have heard songs” (Isaiah 24:16); “your dead will live, my corpses shall arise” (Isaiah 26:19).
Another matter, “all the rivers go to the sea,” all Israel assembles only in Jerusalem and ascends [there] at the times of the festivals each and every year. “Yet the sea is not full,” but Jerusalem is never full, as we learned: “They stand crowded, but prostrate themselves with ample space” (<i>Avot</i> 5:5). Rabbi Shmuel bar Ḥova said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: There were four cubits of space between each and every one, and a cubit on every side, so that one would not hear the prayer of another and become confused.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">There were four cubits for each person when they would prostrate themselves, and one cubit between each person when they prayed (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> “To the place that the rivers go” – to the place that Israel assembles in this world, there they will assemble in the World to Come in the future, as it is stated: “It will be on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded; and the lost in the land of Assyria, and the dispersed in the land of Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem” (Isaiah 27:13).
Another matter, “all the rivers go to the sea,” all property accumulates only to the kingdom of Edom, but the kingdom of Edom is never filled, as Rabbi Levi said: It is written: “The eyes of man [<i>ha’adam</i>] are never satiated” (Proverbs 27:20) – the eyes of Edom are never satiated. You might say that the property that enters Edom never returns to its owners; the verse [therefore] states: “To the place that the rivers go, they go there again” – the place where property is collected, the kingdom of Edom, in this world, from there it will be dispersed in the messianic era, as it is written: “Her merchandise and her fee will be consecrated to the Lord” (Isaiah 23:18). Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei raised a question before Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi], he said to him: ‘What is this that is written: “For the merchandise will be for those who dwell before the Lord” (Isaiah 23:18)?’ He said: ‘Like you, your counterparts, and two wrapped in linen sheets,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Torah scholars who are humble; the reference is to two specific Torah scholars who lived at the time.</i> like you, who are completely insignificant in your eyes.’ Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: The Holy One blessed be He is destined to restore the glow to the faces of the righteous in the future, as it is stated: “But those who love Him are like the sun emerging in its might” (Judges 5:31). Just as He restores their faces, so He restores their garments; today garments that are half silk, tomorrow garments completely of silk. He said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei asked Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> What is that which is written: “To eat to satiation and for fine garments” (Isaiah 23:18)? He said: ‘Today, cotton garments, tomorrow garments completely of silk.’

Once I was ascending in the upper marketplace of Tzippori, and a person approached me, and his name was Yaakov of the village of Sikhnaya, and he said to me one matter in the name of so-and-so<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Some say this is a reference to Jesus.</i> and it brought me pleasure. That matter was: ‘It is written in your Torah: “You shalt not bring the fee of a harlot or the price of a dog to the house of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:19).

Let them be bathrooms for the multitudes,’ and it gave me pleasure. For that matter I was apprehended for heresy. Moreover, I violated what is written in the Torah: “Distance your way from her, and do not approach the door of her house” (Proverbs 5:8). “Distance your way from her,” this is heresy. “And do not approach the door of her house,” this is prostitution. Why? It is because: “For she has felled many wounded; abundant are all she has killed” (Proverbs 7:26).’<br>How far [must one distance oneself]? Rabbi Ḥisda said: Four cubits. For this, Rabbi Elazar ben Dama, son of the sister of Rabbi Yishmael, died. He was bitten by a snake, and Yaakov of the village of Sikhnaya came to cure him [through incantation] in the name of so-and-so, but Rabbi Yishmael did not allow him to do so. He said: ‘You are not permitted to do thus, ben Dama.’ [Ben Dama] said to him: ‘Allow me, and I will cite you proof from the Torah that it is permitted,’ but he did not manage to cite him proof before he died. Rabbi Yishmael rejoiced and said: ‘Happy are you, ben Dama, as your soul emerged in purity and you did not breach the boundary of the Sages, as anyone who breaches the boundary of the Sages, ultimately punishment befalls him, as it is stated: “One who breaches a fence, a snake will bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8).’ But was he not bitten [by a snake]? Rather, that a snake would not bite him in the future.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Had he been cured from this snake bite, he would have thereby sinned and he would have in any event then received another snake bite that would have been incurable (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> What did he have in that regard?<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">What proof did Rabbi Elazar ben Dama seek to bring?</i> “That a man shall do and he will live by them” (Leviticus 18:5) – and not that he will die by them.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This proves that one may violate most prohibitions in order to save a life (<i>Yoma</i> 85b).</i>
There was an incident involving a certain woman who came to Rabbi Eliezer to convert.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">She was a heretic and wanted to repent (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> She said to him: ‘Rabbi, draw me near.’ He said to her: ‘Detail your actions.’ She said: ‘My little son is from my big son.’ He rebuked her. She went to Rabbi Yehoshua, and he accepted her. His students said to him: ‘Rabbi Eliezer rebuffed her and you draw her near?’ He said to them: ‘Once she has decided to convert she will not live at all, as it is written: “None that go to her will return” (Proverbs 2:19), and if they did return, “they do not attain ways of life” (Proverbs 2:19).’<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The woman had been a heretic, and would not be able to avoid severe transgressions for very long. However, since she had decided to repent, she would not live long enough to return to her sinful ways, and therefore Rabbi Yehoshua was not concerned that she would lead others to sin (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i><br>Ḥanina the son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother went toward Kefar Naḥum, and the heretics cast a spell on him, and they lifted him and placed him on a donkey on Shabbat. He went to [Rabbi] Yehoshua his uncle, and he placed oil on him, and he was cured. He said to him: ‘Since the donkey of that wicked one rose against you, you cannot dwell in the Land of Israel.’ He descended to Babylon and died there in peace.<br>Rabbi Yonatan, one of his students absconded to them [the heretics].

He said to them: ‘Is this the way that Jews act?’ They said to him: ‘But is it not written in the Torah: “Cast your lot among us, [let us all have one] purse”?’ He was flying and they were flying after him, until they reached his door and he slammed it in their faces. They said: ‘Rabbi Yonatan, go and relate joyfully to your mother that you did not turn around and did not look at us, as had you turned around and looked at us, more than the extent to which we would have flown after you, you would have flown after us.’<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Nekosa, the heretics were harassing him. They would ask him and he would respond, they would ask him and he would respond. He said to them: ‘You are responding to me for naught. Let us agree between us that any person who prevails over his counterpart will wound the brain of his counterpart with a hammer.’ He prevailed over them and wounded their brains until they were filled with wounds upon wounds. When he came, his students said to him: ‘Rabbi, they aided you from Heaven and you prevailed.’ He said: ‘For naught [do you praise me], go and pray for that man and for that bag, which was filled with gems and pearls, but is now filled with coals.’<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to himself.

Another matter, “all matters are wearying” – even matters of Torah exhaust a person. In the beginning, a person begins to study Torah and, they purify that which [he ruled] impure, and they render impure that which [he ruled] pure, and he does not know through all this exhausting of his strength; ultimately, he will produce <i>a fortiori</i> inferences, verbal analogies, purity and impurity, and the prohibited and the permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Although initially experienced scholars will reject his rulings, and he might feel that his efforts are for naught, ultimately he will thereby learn how to produce accurate rulings.</i>

If you say that they did not see, they already saw partially, as it is stated: “For the Lord God will do nothing, unless He reveals His counsel to His servants the prophets” (Amos 3:7). How did they see? Rabbi Berekhya said: As through the crack of the door.

Chapter 9

<b>“What was is what will be, and what was done is what will be done; and there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9).</b><br>“What was is what will be” – the Rabbis say: In the future, the generations will gather before the Holy One blessed be He and say before Him: ‘Master of the universe, who will recite songs before You first?’ He will say to them: ‘In the past, it was only the generation of Moses that recited songs before Me, and now no one but him will recite songs before Me.’ What is the reason? It is as it is stated: “Sing to the Lord a new song, and His praise from the end of the earth; descenders into the sea, and all that fills it…” (Isaiah 42:10).<br>There was an incident in which the [Roman] government sent to the Rabbis and said to them: ‘Send us one of your torches.’ They said: ‘They have so many torches, yet they ask us for one torch? How many collections of torches they have, how many gems and pearls they have. It seems to us that they are asking us only for one who illuminates aspects of <i>halakha</i>.’ They sent them Rabbi Meir. They would ask him and he would respond, they would ask him and he would respond. Ultimately, they asked him, ‘why is [a pig] called <i>ḥazir</i> [in Hebrew]?’ He said to them: ‘Because it is destined to restore [<i>lehaḥzir</i>] the kingdom to its owner.’ Moreover, Rabbi Meir sat and expounded: ‘The wolf is destined to be sheared of fine wool and a dog of ermine.’ They said to him: ‘Enough, Rabbi Meir, “there is nothing new under the sun.”’<br>The Rabbis say: In the future, the Holy One blessed be He will dispatch a herald and proclaim and say: ‘Anyone who has never eaten pig meat, let him come and collect his reward.’ Many of the nations of the world who never ate pig meat will come to collect their reward. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He will say: ‘Shall these be rewarded in two worlds? Is it not enough that they enjoyed this world, but they seek to enjoy the world of My children, too?’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He will dispatch a herald a second time, and proclaim and say: ‘Anyone who has not eaten the meat of animal carcasses and mauled animals, repugnant creatures and creeping animals, if he did not eat of his own, he ate another’s.’<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Gentiles are not careful to refrain from eating this meat outside the home.</i> That is, why is [a pig] called <i>ḥazir</i>? It is because it is destined to restore [<i>lehaḥzir</i>] greatness and kingdom to its owner.<br>What are <i>taḥash</i> hides? Rabbi Yehuda says: Colored hides. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Ermine. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Holy One blessed be He showed Moses a large beast, and he used it for the purpose of the Tabernacle. [God then] stored it away. Rabbi Avin said: Its name was <i>keresh</i>. Rabbi Hoshaya taught: It had one horn on its forehead, as it is stated: “It shall please the Lord better than a horned [<i>makrin</i>] and hooved ox” (Psalms 69:32).<b> </b>But doesn’t <i>makrin</i> indicate two?<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">It is in the plural.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥhak said: <i>Makrin</i> is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">It is without a <i>yod</i>.

Just as the initial redeemer brought down the manna, as it is stated: “Behold, I will cause bread to rain down from the heavens for you” (Exodus 16:4), so too, the ultimate redeemer will bring down the manna, as it is stated: “There will be an abundance of grain in the land” (Psalms 72:16). Just as the initial redeemer brought up the spring, so too, the ultimate redeemer with bring up the water, as it is stated: “A spring will emerge from the house of the Lord and will irrigate the Shittim valley” (Joel 4:18).

Chapter 10

<b>“There is a matter of which it is said: See, this is new. It has already been, in the ages that were before us” (Ecclesiastes 1:10).</b><br>“There is a matter of which it is said: See, this is new.” It is written: “The Lord delivered to me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God, and on them [<i>va’aleihem</i>] was written in accordance with all [<i>kekhol</i>] the matters [<i>hadevarim</i>]…” (Deuteronomy 9:10). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: “<i>Aleihem</i>, <i>va’aleihem</i>; <i>kol</i>, <i>kekhol</i>; <i>devarim</i>, <i>hadevarim</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">All of these words contain prefixes or introductory words, e.g. the verse could have stated <i>aleihem</i> but instead says <i>vaaleihem</i>, with the prefix <i>va</i>.

It is to teach you that Bible, Mishna, <i>halakhot</i>, <i>Tosefta</i>, and <i>aggada</i>, and rulings that distinguished disciples were destined to issue, already existed, and were given as <i>halakhot</i> to Moses from Sinai. From where is it derived? From what is written: “There is a matter of which it is said: See, this is new.” His counterpart admonishes him: “It has already been, in the ages [that were before us].”<br>Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabi Ḥelbo: This is analogous to one who had a <i>sela</i> coin tied into the corner of his garment,<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">He intended thereby to form a kind of button.</i> and it fell from him. To replace it with one larger, there is no room for it; to replace it with one smaller, it will not be filled; to replace it with an identical one, it will be filled. So too, if you hear Torah from a Torah scholar, you should consider it as though your ears heard it from Mount Sinai. That is what the prophet is admonishing them and saying to them: “Approach me, hear this: From the beginning I did not speak in secret. From the time that it was, I was there” (Isaiah 48:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The prophet is saying that his words, which the people have not followed, are not new.

Chapter 11

<b>“There is no memory of the former ones; and also of the latter ones, who will be, there will be no memory of them, among those who will be last” (Ecclesiastes 1:11).</b><br>“There is no memory of the former ones.” Rabbi Aḥa said: “There is no memory of the former ones” – this is the generation of the flood, “and also of the latter ones” – these are the Sodomites. Of whom is it said: “Among those who will be last”? These are Israel, as it is stated: “Last they will travel by their banners” (Numbers 2:31). Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Shekafa: “There is no memory of the former ones” – these are the Egyptians, “and also of the latter ones” – these are the Amalekites. About whom is it stated that they should expunge the memory of Amalek? Israel, as it is stated: “Expunge the memory of Amalek” (Deuteronomy 25:19).<br>Numerous miracles were performed on Israel’s behalf when they departed from Egypt, and before Israel departed from Egypt. In their regard it says: “There is no memory of the former ones; and also of the latter ones, who will be.” To what do I provide commemoration? To the miracles of the World to Come, as it is written: “They will no longer say: As the Lord lives, who took the children of Israel up from the land of Egypt” (Jeremiah 23:7), but, “rather, as the Lord lives, who took up and who brought the descendants of the house of Israel…from all the lands…” (Jeremiah 23:8).<br>Numerous prophets arose in Israel and their names were not mentioned. But in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will come and bring them with Him. That is what is written: “The Lord my God will come, all the holy ones with You” (Zechariah 14:5). Rabbi Zeira said: Numerous pious men and Torah personalities were worthy of being mentioned, like Yehuda bar Rabbi Ḥizkiya. In their regard it is stated: “And also of the latter ones.” But in the future, the Holy One blessed be He is destined to appoint for Him a group of righteous people of His own, and He will seat them near Him in a great assembly, as it is stated: “The moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed, [for the Lord of hosts has reigned on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem], and before his elders, glory” (Isaiah 24:23). Before his angels, before his legions, or before his priests is not stated, but rather: “Before his elders, glory.” Rabbi Avin said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The Holy One blessed be He is destined to sit as though inside a circle, with the righteous sitting before Him, as that which is written regarding Yehoshafat, as it is stated: “The king of Israel and Yehoshafat king of Judah…were sitting on a threshing floor” (II Chronicles 18:9). Were they sitting on a threshing floor? Rather, as it is taught: The Sanhedrin was arranged in half of a round threshing floor so each of them could see the other (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 36b). Solomon said: ‘I saw Him sitting among them.’ That is what is written: “Her husband is known in the gates, as he sits among the elders of the land” (Proverbs 31:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The husband in this image is God and He makes Himself known to them with them sitting in a semi-circle before Him, so each of them can see Him.</i><br>Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Ḥelbo, Ula Beira’a, Rabbi Beivai, and Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina say: The Holy One blessed be He is destined to make Himself the head of the dance of the righteous in the future, as it is stated: “Pay attention to its ramparts [<i>leḥeila</i>]” (Psalms 48:14). <i>Laḥula</i> is written, as they will be dancing [<i>ḥalin</i>] before Him like young women and pointing at Him with a finger, and saying: “For this is God, our God for ever and ever, He will guide us beyond death [<i>al mut</i>]” (Psalms 48:15). <i>Almut</i>, with quickness, <i>almut</i>, like those young women, as it is stated: “Young women [<i>alamot</i>] playing timbrels” (Psalms 68:26). <i>Almut</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the words <i>al mut</i> at the end of Psalms 48:15.</i> Aquila interpreted: A world without death.

Chapter 12

<b>“I, Kohelet, was king over Israel in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 1:12).</b><br>“I, Kohelet, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.” Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: It would have been appropriate for this to be written at the beginning of the book. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, Rabbi Yishmael taught: “The enemy said: I will pursue, I will overtake” (Exodus 15:9), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the song. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “it was on the eighth day” (Leviticus 9:1), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “you are standing today” (Deuteronomy 29:9), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “The Lord said to Joshua: This day I will begin to exalt you” (Joshua 3:7), it would have been appropriate for this to be written at the beginning of the book. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “hear, kings, listen, princes” (Judges 5:3), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the song. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “in the year of the death of King Uziyahu” (Isaiah 6:1), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book, but there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem” (Jeremiah 2:2), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book, but there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “the word of the Lord was to me saying: Son of man, propound a riddle” (Ezekiel 17:1–2), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book, but there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “I am a boor and do not know, [I was like] a beast [before You]” (Psalms 73:22), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book, but there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “I, Kohelet, was king over Israel in Jerusalem,” it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book, but there is no chronological order in the Torah.<br>“I, Kohelet, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.” I was when I was, but now I am nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">I am stripped of my position, my wealth, and my wisdom.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: When I was, I was, but now I am not worth anything.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">I am stripped of my position and my wealth, but my wisdom remains.

Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Onya, Rabbi Yudan said: King, commoner, king; wise man, fool, wise man; wealthy man, poor man, wealthy man. What is the reason? “I have seen everything in the days of my vanity” (Ecclesiastes 7:15) – a person relates his distress only at a time when he has gained relief, when his wealth is restored.

Chapter 13

<b>“I applied my heart to seek and to search in wisdom, regarding everything that is performed beneath the heavens; it is an unfortunate matter that God has given to the sons of men in which to engage” (Ecclesiastes 1:13).</b><br>“I applied my heart to seek and to search in wisdom.” What is, “to search [<i>latur</i>] in wisdom”? [It is to establish] a set time [<i>tur</i>] for [contemplating all aspects of] wisdom. It is to ascertain the essence [<i>to’ar</i>] of wisdom, as it is stated: “Send men and they will scout [<i>veyaturu</i>] the land” (Numbers 13:2). One who taught Bible well, he would sit before him, one who taught Mishna well, he would sit before him.<br>Another matter, “to seek and to search [<i>latur</i>]” – to do what’s required [<i>latur</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tur</i> is interpreted to mean <i>shura</i>, meaning line, in the sense of “toeing the line.”</i> and to go beyond [<i>lehotir</i>]. When a poet composes alphabetical acrostics, at times he completes it and at times he leaves it unfinished, but Solomon, when he would compose alphabetical acrostics, he would add five letters. That is what is written: “His songs [<i>shiro</i>] were one thousand [<i>elef</i>] and five” (I Kings 5:12); the remainder [<i>shiyuro</i>] of the parable was five beyond <i>alef</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">It was five beyond the alphabet.</i> It was not only in matters of Torah that Solomon searched, but rather regarding everything that is performed under the heavens, for example, how one sweetens mustard and sweetens lupine and how one drinks hot drinks, [such as] wine, water, and peppers, in thirds.<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">If one prepares a drink that is one-third wine, one-third water, and one-third pepper and other spices, it will facilitate good health.</i><br>“It is an unfortunate matter that God has given to the sons of men in which to engage.” Rabbi Bon says: This is the pursuit of property. Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: A person does not leave the world having achieved even half of his desire; rather, if he has one hundred he wishes to turn them into two hundred. If he has two hundred, he wishes to turn them into four hundred. “In which to engage,” Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Although it is in the same category as idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and murder, the [sin] that is most severe is robbery. Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Levi: If a person was privileged and used his property for a mitzva, he prays and will be answered [<i>vena’ana</i>], as it is stated: “My righteousness will bear witness [<i>ve’anta</i>] for me” (Genesis 30:33). If not, it will bear witness against him and prosecute him, as it says: “To testify [<i>la’anot</i>] maliciously against him” (Deuteronomy 19:16).<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the pursuit of robbery, as Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is analogous to a <i>se’a</i> measure filled with iniquities; which is the first of them to prosecute? It is robbery, as Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is written: “And shatter [<i>uvtza’am</i>] the head of all of them” (Amos 9:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Uvtza’am</i> evokes the word <i>betza</i>, which means ill-gotten gain.</i> Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Ezekiel enumerated twenty-four sins, and he concluded with none other than robbery; that is what is written: “I have struck My hand because of the ill-gotten gain that you acquired…” (Ezekiel 22:13).<br>Rabbi Ḥunya interpreted the verse regarding the Prophets and Writings, as had Israel merited, they would read only the five books of the Torah, just five books. The books of the Prophets and Writings were given to them only so they would exert themselves in their study and in the Torah, and perform mitzvot and acts of righteousness, in order to receive a proper reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Although these books, which are comprised primarily of rebuke to Israel for its sins, would not have been given had the people not sinned, once they were given, one who studies them receives reward.</i> [As] the Rabbis say: Even so, “in which to engage,” they receive reward for them as they do for the five books of the Torah.<br>Rabbi Abbahu said: This is the pursuit of Torah, for a person studies Torah and forgets it. The Rabbis there, in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak from here,<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis of Babylonia said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak from the land of Israel.</i> and Rabbi Tovya in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: It is for his own good that a person studies Torah and forgets, as were a person to study Torah and not forget it, one would engage in Torah study two or three years and would return to engage in his labor and never pay attention to it for the rest of his life. Rather, because a person studies Torah and forgets it, he does not move or remove himself from matters of Torah.<br>The Rabbis say: This is the pursuit of robbery. Know that it is so, since the earlier generations, because they were engaged and steeped in robbery, as it is stated: “They trespass, and flocks they steal and graze” (Job 24:2), were eliminated from the world through water. But the tribes of Reuben and Gad distanced themselves from robbery; therefore, the Holy One blessed be He gave them their inheritance in a place where there is no robbery, as it is stated: “Behold, the place is a place of livestock…” (Numbers 32:1).

Chapter 14

<b>“I have seen all the actions that were performed under the sun; and, behold, everything is vanity and herding wind” (Ecclesiastes 1:14).</b><br>“I have seen all the actions that were performed…” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: This is analogous to an elderly man who was sitting at a fork in the road and there were two paths before him. One, its beginning was level and its end was thorns, cedars, and reeds; and one, its beginning was thorns, cedars, and reeds, and its end was level. He would caution the passersby and say: ‘This one, its beginning is level and its end is thorns, cedars, and reeds; and that one, its beginning is thorns, cedars, and reeds, and its end is level.’ Should people not be appreciative of him for cautioning them for their own good, so they would not exhaust themselves? Similarly, the people should be obliged to Solomon, as he was sitting at the gates of wisdom and cautioning Israel: “I returned and saw under the sun [that the race is not to the swift, the battle is not to the strong, the bread is not to the wise, the riches are not to men of understanding, and favor is not to men of skill; rather, time and chance happens to them all]” (Ecclesiastes 9:11); “I have seen all the actions that were performed under the sun [and, behold, everything is vanity and herding wind],” except for repentance and good deeds.<br>The Rabbis say: This is analogous to an astrologer who was sitting at the entrance of the port, and he would caution all the passersby and say to them: ‘This merchandise should go to such and such place,<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">Where it will be in high demand.</i> and that merchandise should go to such and such place.’ Should the people not be appreciative of him? So too, [people should be appreciative] of Solomon, who said: “I have seen all the actions…[everything is vanity],” except for repentance and good deeds.

Chapter 15

<b>“That which is warped cannot be straightened, and that which is lacking cannot be counted” (Ecclesiastes 1:15).</b><br>“That which is warped cannot be straightened.” In this world, one who is warped can be straightened, and one who is lacking can be counted. But in the future, one who is warped cannot be straightened, and one who is lacking cannot be counted. There are those among the wicked who were friends with each other in [this] world. If one of them repented during his lifetime, before his death, and one of them did not repent before his death, the one who did so in his lifetime is privileged to stand in the company of the righteous, and the other one stands in the company of the wicked. He sees his counterpart and says: ‘Is there, perhaps, favoritism in this world? Woe to that man.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">He is referring to himself. The same is true of the third-person reference (“he”) in the next sentence.</i> He and that one, we were together in the world. We were as one, we stole as one, we robbed as one, and we did all the evil deeds in the world together. Why is that one in the company of the righteous and this man is in the company of the wicked?’ They say to him: ‘You great fool, you were repulsive after your death for two or three days. They did not place you into a coffin, and they dragged you to your grave with ropes. “The maggot is spread under you and worms cover you” (Isaiah 14:11). Your counterpart saw your repulsiveness and took an oath to abandon his wicked path, and he repented like a righteous man. His repentance enabled him to take life, honor, and a portion here with the righteous. Why [are you being punished] to this extent? It is because you had the opportunity to repent, and had you repented, all would have been well for you.’<br>He says to them: ‘Allow me, and I will go and repent.’ They respond to him and say: ‘Oh, you great fool, don’t you know that this world is comparable to Shabbat, and the world from which you came is comparable to the day before Shabbat? If a person does not prepare on the day before Shabbat, what will he eat on Shabbat? Don’t you know that the world from which you came is comparable to dry land and this world is comparable to the sea? If a person does not prepare on dry land, what will he eat at sea? Don’t you know that this world is comparable to a wilderness, and the world from which you came is comparable to a settlement? If a person does not prepare in the settlement, what will he eat in the wilderness?’ Immediately, he grits his teeth and eats his flesh, as it is stated: “The fool folds his hands, and eats his flesh” (Ecclesiastes 4:5). He says: ‘Allow me and I will see the glory of my counterpart.’ They say: ‘You great fool, we are commanded from the mouth of the Almighty that neither will the righteous stand among the wicked, nor the wicked among the righteous, not the pure alongside the impure, nor the impure alongside the pure. What are we commanded regarding this gate? “This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous will enter it” (Psalms 118:20).’ Immediately, he rends his garments and pulls out his hair, as it is stated: “The wicked will see and be angered” (Psalms 112:10).
Another matter, “that which is warped [<i>me’uvat</i>] cannot be straightened” – since the waters were corrupted [<i>nitavetu</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">They became salted.</i> during the six days of Creation, they have not yet been repaired. “And that which is lacking cannot be counted” – since the Holy One blessed be He subtracted eleven days from the lunar year relative to the solar year, how many years, cycles, and intercalations [have passed], and [yet the time has not arrived when] the solar year [will be the same as] the lunar [year].<br>Another matter, “that which is warped [<i>me’uvat</i>] cannot be straightened” – once the actions of the generation of the flood were corrupted [<i>nitavetu</i>], they were not repaired. “And that which is lacking” – since the Holy One blessed be He minimized their years, as it is stated: “His days shall be one hundred and twenty years” (Genesis 6:3), they have not been restored.<br>Another matter, “that which is warped [<i>me’uvat</i>] cannot be straightened” – if a person does not divert [<i>me’avet</i>] himself from Torah [study], he can repair himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">Even if he sins.</i> “And that which is lacking cannot be counted” – if a person does not detract from his Torah [study], he can still be counted.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Among the Torah scholars.</i> Once a person diverts himself from Torah [study], he cannot repair [himself], and once a person detracts from his Torah [study], he cannot be counted. As in the case of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar who studied together, and Rabbi Yehuda married his wife. Rabbi Elazar preceded him by the seven days of the wedding feast,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">He arrived at the yeshiva seven days earlier than Rabbi Yehuda, who waited until after the seven days of festivities following his wedding to go to the yeshiva.</i> and several years passed in which [Rabbi Yehuda] tried to catch up to him [in his studies] but he was unable to catch up to him; that is: “And that which is lacking cannot be counted.”<br>If the time for reciting <i>Shema</i> arrived and he did not read it at its time, in his regard, the verse says: “That which is warped cannot be straightened.” If the time of prayer arrived and he did not pray by then, in his regard it is stated: “And that which is lacking cannot be counted.” We learned that Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: What is “that which is warped cannot be straightened”? It is one who engages in relations with a forbidden relative and he begot a <i>mamzer</i><sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mamzer</i> is a child born as a result of certain forbidden relations.

Who is that? It is a Torah scholar who forsakes the Torah. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: If a person steals, he can return the stolen item. If he robbed, he can return the robbed item. It is not in that regard that it is stated: “That which is warped cannot be straightened.” However, one who has relations with a married woman has cast his life from the world, and has forbidden her to her husband. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: One does not say: Examine this camel, perhaps it is blemished; examine this pig, perhaps it is blemished. What does one examine? It is the daily offerings. What is that? It is a Torah scholar who forsook the Torah. Yehuda ben Lakish [said] in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: In his regard it is stated: “Like a bird straying from its nest, so is a man [who wanders from his place]” (Proverbs 27:8).<br>He further states: The thought of creating one thousand generations entered His mind.

It is the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">God had thought to create one thousand generations before the giving of the Torah, but He created only twenty-six.</i> Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Nine hundred and eighty [generations were obliterated], and what is the reason [to say this]? “He commanded the matter for one thousand generations” – this is circumcision.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">God had thought to create one thousand generations before giving the command regarding circumcision, but He created only twenty.</i> Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: A person should never abstain from going to the study hall, as several times this <i>halakha</i> regarding a boat in the Jordan was questioned in Yavne: A boat in the Jordan, why is it ritually impure? No one got up, and no one said anything about it, until Rabbi Ḥanina ben Akavya taught it in his city: A boat in the Jordan, why is it ritually impure? It is because they load it on dry land and lower it into the water.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">Since it can be moved on dry land when it is loaded, it is susceptible to ritual impurity (see <i>Shabbat</i> 83b).</i> They answered him: But the seafarers in Ashkelon submerge it…?<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">They load and unload the boat in the water; therefore, it should not be susceptible to impurity.</i> Rabbi Elazar ben Yosei answers: It is different [than other types of boats] because it is partially sunk into the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">It is loaded while partially on the ground and then dragged fully into the water.

Chapter 18

<b>“For with much wisdom is much vexation; and one who increases knowledge increases pain” (Ecclesiastes 1:18).</b><br>“For with much wisdom is much vexation” – as long as a person amasses wisdom he amasses vexation, and as long as he amasses knowledge he increases suffering. Solomon said: ‘Because I amassed wisdom I amassed vexation, and because I amassed knowledge I amassed suffering.’ Rav said: A Torah scholar does not require forewarning.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">An example of suffering is that, as opposed to others who are not punished without forewarning, Torah scholars are punished without forewarning.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Like fine linen garments that come from Beit She’an; if one of them was blackened, how much money is<b> </b>it worth? Coarse linen garments from Arbel; if one of them is blackened, what are they and what is their value?<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Since they were cheap to begin with, the loss incurred is negligible.</i> To what is this matter analogous?

This one ate light foods and he was harmed, and that one ate coarse foods and was not harmed. Likewise, have you ever seen a donkey shuddering or a camel shuddering? Rather, where is suffering found? It is in people.<br>Rabbi Yishmael taught: The load corresponds to the camel.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">So too, a person’s suffering corresponds to his wisdom and knowledge.</i> Rabbi Meir taught: Because the snake’s wisdom was superior, its punishment corresponded to its wisdom, as it is stated: “The snake was more cunning than all beasts of the field” (Genesis 3:1); therefore, he was “more accursed than all animals and all beasts of the field” (Genesis 3:14). Some amassed wisdom for their benefit, and some amassed wisdom to their detriment; those who amassed for their benefit were Moses and Solomon, and those who amassed to their detriment were Do’eg and Aḥitofel. Some increased their might for their benefit, and some increased their might to their detriment; those who increased for their benefit were David and Judah, and those who increased to their detriment were Samson and Goliath. Some amassed wealth for their benefit, and some amassed wealth to their detriment; those who amassed for their benefit were David and Solomon, and those who amassed to their detriment were Koraḥ and Haman. Some amassed children for their benefit, and some amassed children to their detriment; those amassed for their benefit were the sons of Jacob and David, [and those] to their detriment, the sons of Ahab and Eli, as it is stated: “The sons of Eli were wicked men…” (I Samuel 2:12). [Similarly,] the sons of Ahab did not accept the yoke of Heaven upon themselves, “they did not know the Lord” (I Samuel 2:12), as they said there is no kingdom of Heaven.

Chapter 2

<b>“Of laughter, I said it is confounded; and of joy, what does it accomplish?” (Ecclesiastes 2:2).</b><br>“Of laughter, I said it is confounded” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: How confounded is the laughter of the nations of the world in their circuses and theaters. “And of joy, what does it accomplish?” Why would a Torah scholar enter these [places]?<br>Another matter: How confounded is the laughter that the attribute of justice laughed at the generation of the flood; that is what is written: “Their houses are peaceful, without fear…” (Job 21:9). “Their descendants are well placed before them…” (Job 21:8). “His bull breeds and does not fail…” (Job 21:10). “They send out their young like a flock” (Job 21:11). “They sing to the timbrel and harp…” (Job 21:12). “They spend their days in prosperity” (Job 21:13). What is written there? “They said to God: Depart from us” (Job 21:14). Once they said: “What is the Almighty that we should serve Him?” (Job 21:15), the Holy One blessed be He said to them: “And of joy, what does it accomplish?” By your lives, I will obliterate you from the world. That is what is written: “He obliterated all existence” (Genesis 7:23).<br>Another matter: “Of laughter, I said it is confounded” – how confounded is the laughter that the attribute of justice laughed at the people of Sodom, as it is stated: “A land from which bread emerges…” (Job 28:5); “a place whose stones are sapphires…” (Job 28:6); “a path that birds of prey do not know…” (Job 28:7). When they said: We will do away with the policy of passersby from our midst,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They wanted to ensure that outsiders would not pass through their territory.</i> that is what is written: “He breached a shaft from the residents, forgotten from all passersby” (Job 28:4). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: By your life, I will eliminate your memory from the world, as it is stated: “The Lord rained upon Sodom [and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire]” (Genesis 19:24).
Another matter: “Of laughter, I said it is confounded” – how confounded is the laughter that the attribute of justice laughed at Elisheva bat Aminadav. Elisheva bat Aminadav experienced four celebrations on one day: Moses, her brother-in-law, was king; Naḥshon, her brother, was the prince who was head of all the princes; Aaron, her husband, was the [High] Priest wearing the ephod stones; and her two sons were deputy High Priests. But when they entered [the Tabernacle] to burn incense without permission, they were burned and her celebration was transformed to mourning. That is, “and of joy, what does it accomplish,” as it is stated: “After the death of the two sons of Aaron…” (Leviticus 16:1).
Another matter: “Of laughter, I said it is confounded” – how confounding is laughter, as Rabbi Aḥa said that Shmuel said: Three are the matters with which the attribute of justice challenged [Solomon], and ultimately confounded and confused him. It is written: “He shall not have many wives” (Deuteronomy 17:17), and it is written [of Solomon]: “He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines” (I Kings 11:3). It is written: “He shall not have many horses” (Deuteronomy 17:16), and it is written: “Solomon had forty thousand stables of horses” (I Kings 5:6). It is written: “And gold and silver he shall not amass greatly” (Deuteronomy 17:17), and it is written: “The king made the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as stones” (II Chronicles 1:2). Would they not have been stolen? Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: There were ten-cubit stones and eight-cubit stones.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, they were far too large to be moved without an apparatus operated by many people working together.</i> It is taught in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Even the weights during the reign of Solomon were made of gold, as it is stated: “None of silver, as it was not considered anything during the reign of Solomon” (I Kings 10:21). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘“And of joy, what does it accomplish?”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Solomon thought he could violate these proscriptions without sinning, but he eventually did sin (see I Kings, chap. 11). Consequently, God deprived him of his wealth and status.</i> What is this crown doing in your hands? Descend from My throne.’ At that moment, an angel descended in the image of Solomon and sat on his throne. [Solomon] would circulate among the synagogues, the study halls, and the homes of the prominent leaders of Israel and say: “I am Kohelet, I was king [over Israel in Jerusalem]” (Ecclesiastes 1:12). They would strike him with a reed and place before him a bowl of grits.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They believed that the “real” Solomon was sitting on his throne and that this individual had lost his mind.</i> At that moment he wept and said: “This was my portion from all my exertion” (Ecclesiastes 2:10).
Another matter: “Of laughter, I said it is confounded” – Rabbi Pinḥas said: If the laughter is confounded, what does joy accomplish? There was an incident involving a man who was among the prominent leaders in Babylonia, whose son married a woman on a Wednesday.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In accordance with the rabbinic ordinance that one marrying a virgin should do so on a Wednesday; see Mishna <i>Ketubot</i> 1:1.</i> He made a feast for the Sages. He said to his son: ‘Go up to the attic and bring us fine wine from such and such barrel.’ He went to bring aged wine from the attic; a snake bit him and he died. [The father] waited for him to descend, and he did not descend. He said: ‘I will go up and see what is keeping my son.’ He went up and found that a snake had bitten him and he was dead, cast among the barrels. That pious man waited until the guests had eaten and drunk their entire meal and concluded reciting the blessing. He said to them: ‘My rabbis, did you not come to that man’s<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To my house.</i> house to recite the groom’s blessing, to bless his son? Now recite the mourner’s blessing on his behalf for his son. Did you not come to bring him to the wedding canopy? Place him into the grave.’ Rabbi Zakai entered and concluded his [eulogy with the verse]: “Of laughter, I said it is confounded; and of joy, what does it accomplish?”

<b>“I searched in my heart to tempt my flesh with wine, and, my heart conducting itself with wisdom, to grasp folly, until I will see which is best for the sons of man that they should perform under the heaven during the limited days of their lives” (Ecclesiastes 2:3).</b><br>“I searched in my heart to tempt [my flesh] with wine” – Solomon said: “I searched in my heart to tempt [my flesh] with wine,” to tempt my flesh with the wine of Torah; “and my heart, conducting itself with wisdom,” with the wisdom of Torah. “To grasp folly” – Rabbi Yudan raised a question before Rabbi Aḥa: What is this that is written: “To grasp folly [<i>sikhlut</i>]”?

<b>“I increased my actions; I built myself houses, I planted myself vineyards” (Ecclesiastes 2:4).</b><br>“I increased my actions” – Solomon said: I have made my actions greater than the actions of my ancestors. “I increased my actions” – that is what is written: “The king crafted a great ivory throne…” (I Kings 10:18). “I built myself houses” – that is what is written: “It was at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses” (I Kings 9:10). “I planted myself vineyards,” as it is stated: “Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon” (Song of Songs 8:11).

Chapter 5

<b>“I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted in them trees of every fruit” (Ecclesiastes 2:5).</b><br>“I made myself gardens and orchards” – in its plain sense. “And I planted in them trees of every fruit” – even peppers.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Peppercorn trees are indigenous to foreign countries; he would import them with their soil and plant them in the Land of Israel.</i> Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Solomon would use the demons; he would send them to India and they would bring him water from there,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This was so the plants would grow in the soil and be irrigated with the water to which they were accustomed to grow.</i> and he would water [the pepper trees] here and they would bear fruit.

<b>“I made myself pools of water to irrigate from them a forest which grows trees” (Ecclesiastes 2:6).</b><br>“I made myself pools of water” – an irrigation system; “to irrigate from them a forest which grows trees” – this is the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “[Three hundred shields of gold…] The king placed them in the house of the forest of Lebanon” (II Chronicles 9:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The shields were kept in the Land of Israel; hence, the Land of Israel is referred to as a forest.</i>

Chapter 7

<b>“I purchased myself slaves and maidservants and I had stewards. I also had great possession of herds and flocks, beyond all who preceded me in Jerusalem” (Ecclesiastes 2:7).</b><br>“I purchased myself slaves and maidservants,” as it is written: “All the Netinim and the children of Solomon’s slaves were three hundred and ninety-two” (Nehemiah 7:60). “And I had stewards,” as it is stated: “Those officials provided for King [Solomon]…they lacked nothing” (I Kings 5:7). What is, “they lacked nothing”? Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Solomon’s table never lacked [anything], neither a rose<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">There is a variant reading, with beets [<i>tered</i>] rather than rose [<i>vered</i>].</i> in the summer nor cucumbers in the rainy season; rather, they would taste them throughout the year.<br>“I also had great possession of herds and flocks” – and it says: “And fattened fowl” (I Kings 5:3). What are “fattened fowl [<i>barburim</i>]”? They are species of fowl grown in cages [<i>birberayya</i>]. Rabbi Berekhya [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: It was a large bird, which was outstanding, and exceptional, and it would ascend and perch on his table each and every day. From where would it come? Each day, it would come from Barbary.

Chapter 8

<b>“I also gathered for myself silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and countries; I acquired for myself songsters and songstresses, and chests and wagons of the pleasures of people” (Ecclesiastes 2:8).</b><br>“I also gathered for myself silver and gold” – that is what is written: “The king made the silver in Jerusalem as stones” (I Kings 10:27). Is it possible that [silver was placed] as stones on paths and in courtyards and was not stolen? It is because they were large, ten-cubit stones and eight-cubit stones. It is taught: Even the weights during the reign of Solomon were made of gold, and they would use weights of gold, [even the weight of] a <i>kanterin</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A talent; a very large measure.</i> Each and every weight, large and small, was of gold.<br>“And the treasure of kings” – as it is stated: “All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon” (II Chronicles 9:23). “And countries [<i>vehamedinot</i>]” – this is the queen of Sheba, who would challenge [<i>medayyenet</i>] him with her wisdom and her questions, but was unable to overcome him, as it is stated: “She came to challenge him with riddles” (I Kings 10:1). “King Solomon gave the Queen of Sheba all her desires that she requested” (I Kings 10:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew verse cited does not correspond exactly to the actual verse.</i> “I acquired for myself songsters and songstresses” – male singers and female singers; “the pleasures of people” – pools of flowing water and bathhouses; “chests [<i>shidda</i>] and wagons [<i>veshiddot</i>]” – demons [<i>sheida</i>] and demonesses [<i>vesheideta</i>], who would heat them.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Neḥemya said: Does the verse come to teach us only of Solomon’s wealth? It is speaking only regarding matters of Torah. “I increased my actions [<i>maasai</i>]” – this is what is written: “The tablets were the work [<i>maaseh</i>] of God” (Exodus 32:16). “I built myself houses” – these are synagogues and study halls. “I planted myself vineyards” – these are the rows of Torah scholars who sit in rows like a vineyard, as it is taught in a mishna: This exposition was expounded by Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya before the Sages in the vineyard of Yavne.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Ketubot</i> 4:6.</i> Was it in fact a vineyard?

Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi interpreted the verse regarding Israel upon their entry into the land. “I increased my actions [<i>maasai</i>]” (Ecclesiastes 2:4) – “When you will come to the land of your dwellings.… you will perform [<i>vaasitem</i>] a fire offering to the Lord” (Numbers 15:2–3). “I built myself houses” (Ecclesiastes 2:4) – “houses filled with everything good” (Deuteronomy 6:11). “I planted myself vineyards” (Ecclesiastes 2:4) – “vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant” (Deuteronomy 6:11). “I made myself gardens and orchards” (Ecclesiastes 2:5) – Hadrian, may his bones be crushed, asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: ‘It is written in the Torah: “A land in which without poverty [you will eat bread; you will not lack anything there]” (Deuteronomy 8:9). Can you bring me three things that I request?’ He said to him: ‘What are they?’ He said to him: ‘Peppers, pheasants, and silk fabrics.’ [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya] brought him peppers from Nitzḥana, pheasants from Tzaidan, and some say from Akhberin, and silk fabric from Gush Ḥalav. “I made myself pools of water” (Ecclesiastes 2:6) – as it is written: “A land of streams of water” (Deuteronomy 8:7). “To irrigate from them a forest which grows trees” (Ecclesiastes 2:6) – even wood for the shafts of arrows was not lacking in the Land of Israel.<br>“I purchased myself slaves and maidservants” (Ecclesiastes 2:7) – “a mixed multitude [left with them]” (Exodus 12:38). “And I had stewards” (Ecclesiastes 2:7) – these are the Givonites, whom Joshua tasked as hewers of wood and drawers of water, as it is stated: “Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water” (Joshua 9:27). “I also had great possession of herds and flocks” (Ecclesiastes 2:7) – “[the children of Gad and the children of Reuben had a very great] multitude of livestock…” (Numbers 32:1). “I also gathered for myself silver and gold” – these are matters of Torah, as it is stated: “He took them out with silver and gold” (Psalms 105:37). “And the treasure of kings and countries” – these are the spoils of Og and the spoils of Midyan.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 21:35 and 31:9.</i> “I acquired for myself songsters and songstresses” – male singers and women singers. “And the pleasures of people” – these are the pleasures of the children of Israel; “chests [<i>shidda</i>] and wagons [<i>shiddot</i>]” – indulgences and luxuries.

Chapter 9

<b>“I grew great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem; my wisdom, too, was sustained in me” (Ecclesiastes 2:9).</b><br>“I grew great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem” – who was before him in Jerusalem?

Chapter 13

<b>“I have seen that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, like the advantage of light over darkness” (Ecclesiastes 2:13).</b><br>“I have seen that there is an advantage” – it is taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: Just as there is an advantage to light over darkness, so, there is an advantage to matters of Torah over matters of vanity.

Chapter 14

<b>“The wise man, his eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness.

Do you believe that you will eat of them?’ He said: ‘If I merit, I will eat. If not, just as my ancestors toiled on my behalf, so, I will toil on behalf of my children.’ He said to him: ‘By your life, if you merit and eat of them, let me know.’ After a period of time, it produced figs. He said: The time has come for me to inform the king. What did he do? He filled a basket with figs, ascended, and stood at the gate of the palace. They said to him: ‘What is your business [here]?’ He said to them: ‘Go and say to the king that the old Jewish man whom you passed wishes to greet you.’ They went and told the king: ‘There is an old Jewish man who wishes to greet you.’ He said to them: ‘Show him in.’ When he entered, [Hadrian] said to him: ‘What is your business [here]?’ He said to him: ‘I am the elderly man whom you passed while I was digging holes to plant trees. You said to me: If you merit and eat of them, let me know. I merited and ate of them, and these are figs from their produce.’ Hadrian said at that moment [to his servants]: ‘I command you to empty this basket and fill it with dinars.’ His servants said to him: ‘Are you going to give all this honor to this old Jewish man?’ He said to them: ‘His Creator honors him; will I not honor him?’<br>His neighbor’s wife was an imbecile. She said to her husband: ‘Senseless one, senseless one, see that this king loves figs and exchanges them for dinars.’ What did he do? He filled his container with figs and stood before the palace. They said to him: ‘What is your business [here]?’ He said to them: ‘I heard that the king loves figs and exchanges them for dinars.’ They entered and said to the king: ‘There is a certain old man standing at the palace gates laden with a container filled with figs. We said to him: What is your business [here]? He said to us: I heard that the king loves figs and exchanges them for dinars.’ [Hadrian] said: ‘I command you to stand him at the palace gates, and anyone who enters or exits will throw one of the figs at his face.’ Toward evening, they released him and he went home. He said to his wife: ‘I have to pay you back for all the honor [that I received at the palace].’ She said to him: ‘Go and boast to your mother that they were figs and they were not citrons, that they were ripe and were not unripe.’<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Ripe figs are softer than citrons or unripe figs.</i>

Chapter 23

<b>“For all his days are pains, and his occupation is anger; even at night his heart does not rest.

From where is it derived that [this is true] even during the day? It is as it is stated: “And every inclination of his heart’s thoughts was only bad all day long” (Genesis 6:5). The Holy One blessed be He, too, brought punishment upon them during the day and at night, as it is stated: “The rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights” (Genesis 7:12). Alternatively: “Even at night his heart does not rest” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, who decided in His heart to bring punishment upon them by day and by night, as it is stated: “He obliterated all existence” (Genesis 7:23).<br>Another matter: “For all his days are pains” – these are the Sodomites, who would pain the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “And his occupation is anger” – as they angered the Holy One blessed be He with their handiwork. “Even at night his heart does not rest” – [this is God, who decided] to bring punishment upon them during the day and at night, as it is stated: “The Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah…” (Genesis 19:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">He did so at the end of the night into the morning.</i><br>Another matter: “For all his days are pains” – these are the Egyptians, who would pain the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “And his occupation is anger” – as they angered the Holy One blessed be He with their handiwork. “Even at night his heart does not rest” – when one of the Israelites would complete his labor, the Egyptian would say to him: ‘Hoe me two furrows, chop me two logs.’ Alternatively: “Even at night his heart does not rest” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, who decided in His heart to bring punishment upon them during the day and punishment upon them at night, as it is stated: “It was at midnight [that the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">And the Exodus took place during the day.</i>

Chapter 24

<b>“There is nothing better for a man than for him to eat and drink, and indulge his soul through his toil.

Rabbi Yona said: The paradigm for all of them is as it is stated: “[There is nothing better…than to eat, drink, and rejoice]. That will accompany him in his toil [<i>baamalo</i>]” (Ecclesiastes 8:15) – in his world [<i>beolamo</i>], in this world. “During the days of his life” (Ecclesiastes 8:15) – to the grave. Is there food and drink in the grave that it accompanies a person to his grave? Rather, these are Torah and good deeds.

Parasha 3



Chapter 1

<b>“For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under the heavens” (Ecclesiastes 3:1).</b><br>There was a time for Adam the first man to enter the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “He placed him in the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 2:15). And there was a time to depart from there, as it is stated: “He banished the man…” (Genesis 3:24). There was a time for Noah to enter the ark, as it is stated: “Come…to the ark” (Genesis 7:1). And there was a time to emerge from there, as it is stated: “Emerge from the ark” (Genesis 8:16). There was a time for the [mitzva of] circumcision to be given to Abraham, as it is stated: “You shall observe My covenant” (Genesis 17:9). And there was a time for his descendants to be circumcised, [and for many] of them to be circumcised [at once. This occurred] in two places, once in Egypt and once in the wilderness, as it is stated: “All the people who departed were circumcised [and all the people born in the wilderness…were not circumcised]” (Joshua 5:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua saw to their circumcision.</i><br>“And a time for every purpose under the heavens” – there was a time for the Torah to be given to Israel. Rav Beivai said: It was time for a certain thing that was located above the heavens to now be given under the heavens. What is that? It is the Torah, as it is stated: “God spoke all these matters, saying” (Exodus 20:1).

Chapter 2

<b>“A time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot that which is planted” (Ecclesiastes 3:2).</b><br>“A time to be born, and a time to die” – Rabbi Berekhya said: Is all of Solomon’s wisdom that he said, “a time to be born, and a time to die”? What is [the meaning of this verse]? Happy is the person whose time of death is like the time of his birth; just as at the time of his birth he was clean [of sin], so, too, at the time of his death he is clean.<br>“A time to be born, and a time to die” – at the time when a woman sits on the birthing stool, they call her <i>ḥaita</i>. Why do they call her <i>ḥaita</i>? Because she is on the verge of dying, and she lives [<i>ḥayya</i>]. Why do they call her <i>meḥabalta</i>? It is because she is mortgaged in the hands of death, just as you say: “if you take as security [<i>ḥavol taḥvol</i>] your neighbor’s garment” (Exodus 22:25). Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Natan of Beit Guvrin said: “The grave and the barren womb” (Proverbs 30:16) – why is the grave juxtaposed to the womb? It is to say to you: Just as one is removed from the womb with loud cries, so too, one will be removed from the grave with loud cries.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cries of thanksgiving to God when the dead are resurrected.</i>
Another matter, “a time to be born [and a time to die]” – even the angel of death becomes her prosecutor.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to a woman in childbirth.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: For three transgressions women die during childbirth…<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These are: Failure to observe the laws of menstruation, failure to separate <i>ĥalla</i> from dough, and failure to kindle the Shabbat lamp (Mishna <i>Shabbat</i> 2:6). During a time of danger, such as childbirth, one is more vulnerable to being punished for one’s sins. The same is true of the dangerous circumstances the midrash mentions in the next sentence.</i> and in three circumstances men die: One who is located in a rickety house, one who sets out on the road alone, and one who sets sail in the Mediterranean Sea; the accuser becomes his prosecutor, as Rabbi Levi said: The accuser commonly prosecutes [people found] in three places: One who is located in a rickety house, one who sets out on the road alone, and one who sets sail in the Mediterranean Sea. Rabbi Shimon bar Abba, in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: All roads are in a presumptive state of danger. When Rabbi Yannai would depart on a highway he would leave instructions for his household.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Instructions on what to do in case he died while on his journey.</i> Rabbi Ḥelbo and Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: All who are ill are in a presumptive state of danger.

From when you bind your <i>lulav</i>, moor your ship.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From Sukkot until the summer, do not set sail.</i> If you entered the synagogue and heard the voice of the congregation praying for rain, do not rely on my prayer.’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The prayer for rain is recited between Sukkot and Passover. Rainy weather brings with it dangerous sailing conditions.</i><br>Rabbi Yehoshua son of Rabbi Tanḥum ben Rabbi Ḥiyya, of the Agon village, was in Asia Minor. He sought to set sail between Sukkot and Hanukkah. A certain noblewoman said to him: ‘Is this the period to set sail?’ But he did not heed her words. He saw his father in a dream saying: ‘My son will be without a grave, “neither did he have a burial”’ (Ecclesiastes 6:3). He did not heed the words of this one or to the words of that one, and so it befell him.
Another matter, “a time to be born” – from the time to be born, it is the time to die. From the moment that a person is born, it is decreed upon him how many years he will live. If he merits, he will complete his years. If not, his life will be shortened, as it is written: “The fear of the Lord will increase days, but the years of the wicked will be shortened” (Proverbs 10:27). This is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. The Rabbis say: If he merits, his life will be extended; if not, his life will be shortened. If he merits, his life will be extended, as it is stated: “Behold, I will add fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5). He said to them: From his own it is added to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">If one had his original life expectancy shortened, it will be restored. Thus, regarding the verse cited from Isaiah, the fifteen years restored Hezekiah to his original life expectancy.</i> Know [that this is so,] as it is written: “Behold, a son is born to the house of David, Josiah is his name…” (I Kings 13:2), and Menashe<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The order of the succession of the monarchy was Hezekiah, Menashe, Amon, Josiah.</i> had not yet entered the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The prophecy about Josiah had been delivered hundreds of years earlier. When Hezekiah was granted the additional fifteen years, Menashe, his son, had not yet been born.

That is not stated, but rather “to the house of David,” [and it could have been] a son from a different [branch] of the royal house of David.<br>This supports what the Sages, our rabbis said: There was an incident involving one of the prominent men of Tzippori, who had occasion to circumcise [his son], and the residents of Ein Te’ena came up to honor him and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta came up with them. When they came to the city gates, they came across the sound of lads standing and playing before one courtyard. They saw Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta, who was distinguished and handsome. They said to him: ‘You will not move from here until you dance for us a bit.’ He said to them: ‘This is inappropriate for me, as I am an elderly man.’ He reprimanded them, but they were not daunted and did not submit. He lifted his glance and saw that the courtyard [was going to be] overturned.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Due to their impudence in insisting that Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta dance for them, the courtyard would be destroyed.</i> He said to them: ‘Repeat after me what I say: Go and say to this owner of this courtyard: “If you are sleeping, awaken, as the beginning of sin is sweet but its end is bitter.”’ From the sound of their words the owner of that courtyard awakened, and he emerged, and fell at [Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta’s] feet. He said: ‘Rabbi, I beg of you, do not pay attention to their words, as they are young and foolish.’ [Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta] said to him: ‘What can we do for you, the edict has already been issued.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The courtyard will be destroyed.</i> However, I will delay it for you [so you have enough] time to take out everything that you have in the courtyard.’ When he had taken out everything that he had in the courtyard, that courtyard was lifted up and then crashed down [and was destroyed].<br>They went to fulfill the mitzva of circumcision, and the father of the boy was giving them aged wine to drink, and saying: ‘Drink of this fine wine, as I trust in the Master of Heaven that I will [also] give you to drink of it at his wedding.’ They answered him: ‘Just as you brought him to circumcision, so may you bring him to Torah and to the wedding canopy.’ From the sound of their words, Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta emerged into the darkness,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">He set out to return home even though it was night.</i> he was accosted by the emissary of the people.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The angel of death.</i> [The angel of death] said to him: ‘Is it because you rely on your good deeds that you are going out at a time that is not a time?’<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">For people to be outside.</i> [Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta] said to him: ‘You, who are you?’ He said to him: ‘I am the emissary of the people.’ He said to him: ‘Why do you look forlorn?’ He said: ‘It is from the sound of the harsh words that I hear from people every day.’ He said to him: ‘What are they?’ He said to him: ‘That baby that you circumcised today, I have the document of his [fate, which states] that I am to take him from here in thirty days.

I do not have an incident, but rather a verse: “I will fill the number of your days” (Exodus 23:26). Moses, how many mitzvot did he fulfill and how many acts of righteousness, and ultimately, it was stated to him: “Behold, your days are approaching to die” (Deuteronomy 31:14); that is: “A time to be born [and a time to die].”<br>Another matter, “a time to be born and a time to die” – when a man is born, the Holy One blessed be He waits up to twenty years for him to marry a woman.

Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin interpreted the verses regarding Israel. “A time to be born and a time to die” – the Holy One blessed be He said: For a brief time I was the midwife for My children, as it is written: “As for your birth, on the day you were born” (Ezekiel 16:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The verse quoted is followed by verses in which God describes Israel as an abandoned, bloodied baby, whom He cared for and nursed to health. This is a parable for God saving Israel from Egypt.</i> “And a time to die,” as it is written: “In this wilderness they will expire and there they will die (Numbers 14:35). “No man was left of them, except Caleb son of Yefuneh, and Joshua son of Nun” (Numbers 26:65).<br>“A time to plant,” as it is stated: “I will plant them on their land” (Amos 9:15), “and a time to uproot that which is planted,” as it is written: “The Lord uprooted them from upon their land” (Deuteronomy 29:27). “A time to kill,” as it is written: “He killed all who delighted the eye” (Lamentations 2:4), “and a time to heal,” as it is written: “Behold, I am bringing it a remedy and cure” (Jeremiah 33:6). “A time to breach,” as it is written: “Each woman would depart through the breaches” (Amos 4:3), “and a time to build,” as it is written: “I will build it as in the days of old” (Amos 9:11). “A time to weep,” as it is written: “She will weep at night” (Lamentations 1:2), “and a time to laugh,” as it is written: “Then our mouths will be filled with laughter” (Psalms 126:2). “A time to mourn,” as it is written: “The Lord God of hosts declared that day for weeping and lamentation” (Isaiah 22:12), “and a time to dance,” as it is written: “The squares of the city will be filled [with boys and girls playing in its squares]” (Zechariah 8:5). “A time to cast stones,” as it is written: “The sacred stones are spilled” (Lamentations 4:1), “and a time to gather stones,” as it is written: “Behold, I am laying a stone foundation in Zion” (Isaiah 28:16). “A time to embrace,” as it is stated: “And his right hand embraces me” (Song of Songs 2:6), “and a time to refrain from embrace,” as it is stated: “The Lord will banish man” (Isaiah 6:12).<br>“A time to seek,” as it is written: “From there you will seek the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 4:29), “and a time to lose,” as it is written: “Beware, lest your heart be seduced…you will be swiftly eradicated” (Deuteronomy 11:16–17). “A time to keep [<i>lishmor</i>],” as it is written: “Behold, the Keeper [<i>Shomer</i>] of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4), “and a time to discard,” as it is written: “He cast them to another land” (Deuteronomy 29:27). “A time to rend,” as it is written: “The Lord has rent the kingdom of Israel” (I Samuel 15:28), “and a time to sew,” as it is written: “They will become one in your hand” (Ezekiel 37:17). “A time to be silent,” as it is written: “I have kept silent for a long time” (Isaiah 42:14), “and a time to speak,” as it is written: “Speak to the heart of Jerusalem” (Isaiah 40:2). “A time to love,” as it is written: “I have loved you, said the Lord” (Malachi 1:2), “and a time to hate,” as it is written: “She raised her voice against me; therefore I hated her” (Jeremiah 12:8). “A time for war,” as it is written: “He was transformed into their enemy” (Isaiah 63:10), “and a time for peace,” as it is written: “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river” (Isaiah 66:12).

<b>“What is the advantage of one who works, in that he toils?” (Ecclesiastes 3:9).</b><br>“What is the advantage of one who works…” – Solomon said: Since there are appointed times for everything, to what avail is his craft for the craftsman, and uprightness for the upright?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">One is subject to good or bad fortune regardless of one’s efforts in this world, or one’s uprightness.</i> Alternatively, “what is the advantage”?

The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Initially, I killed the Egyptian firstborn, as it is stated: “It was at midnight, and the Lord smote…” (Exodus 12:29); so, too, every firstborn that will be born to you, you shall consecrate to me, as it is stated: “Consecrate to me each firstborn” (Exodus 13:2); you shall consecrate the firstborn to me due to My faithfulness’ – that is: “The righteous one will live by his faith.”<br>Rabbi Pinḥas [said] in the name of Rabbi Reuven: To what is this matter comparable? [It is comparable] to a king who prepared a feast and invited guests to join him. The king issued an edict and said: ‘Each and every person shall bring with him something on which to recline.’ Some brought rugs, some brought mats, some brought blankets, some brought pillows, some brought chairs, some brought logs, and some brought stones. The king viewed them and said: ‘Each and every person shall recline on what he brought.’ Those who were sitting on the logs and the stones were aggrieved at the king, and said: ‘Is this befitting the honor of a king, that we should be sitting on logs and stones?’ When the king heard [this], he said to them: ‘Is it not enough that you tarnished the palace with [your] logs and stones, which cost me significant [cleaning] expenditures, but you are also impudent to me, and direct accusations against me? Your “honor” was achieved only by you, yourselves.’ So too, in the future, the wicked will be sentenced to Gehenna, and they will be aggrieved at the Holy One blessed be He: ‘We were anticipating the salvation of the Holy One blessed be He, and this befell us?’ The Holy One blessed be He will say to them: ‘When you were [alive] in the world, were you not quarrelsome, slanderers, and evildoers? Were you not men of disputes and men of violence?’ That is what is written: “Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who gird yourselves with firebrands” (Isaiah 50:11) – therefore, “go in the flame of your fire, and among the firebrands that you kindled” (Isaiah 50:11). Lest you say: “From My hand this was to you” (Isaiah 50:11): no, you did this to yourselves; therefore, “you shall lie in sorrow” (Isaiah 50:11), you did this to yourselves.<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish was toiling in Torah study to the fullest extent in the forest of Tiberias. There was a potter there who would prepare him a vessel of drinking water each day. [Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish] would enter<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">A cave, where the potter would leave water for him (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> very tired, and take it and drink it. One time, [the potter] entered and sat with him and fanned him lightly.

Chapter 10

<b>“I have seen the matters that God has given to the sons of men, in which to engage” (Ecclesiastes 3:10).</b><br>“I have seen the matters” – this is the pursuit of property, as Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: A person does not leave the world having achieved even half of his desire; rather, if he has one hundred, he wishes to turn them into two hundred. If he has two hundred, he wishes to turn them into four [hundred]. “In which to engage” – Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: If a person was privileged and used his property for mitzvot, [when] he prays he will be answered [<i>na’aneh</i>]. That is what is said: “My righteousness [<i>tzidkati</i>] will bear witness [<i>ve’anta</i>] for me” (Genesis 30:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">My charity [<i>tzedaka</i>] will lead to my prayers being answered.</i> If not, it will bear witness against him and prosecute him, as it is written: “To testify [<i>la’anot</i>] maliciously against him” (Deuteronomy 19:16).<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the pursuit of robbery, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is analogous to a <i>se’a</i> measure filled with iniquities; which is the first of them to prosecute? It is robbery, as Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: “And shatter [<i>uvtza’am</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This evokes the word <i>betza</i>, which means ill-gotten gain.</i> the head of them all” (Amos 9:1). Rabbi Pinḥas [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Although they were involved with idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed, the most severe of them all is nothing other than robbery. Rabbi Yaakov [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Ezekiel enumerated twenty-four sins, and he concluded with none other than robbery; that is what is written: “I have struck My hand because of the ill-gotten gain that you acquired…” (Ezekiel 22:13).<br>Rabbi Ḥunya interpreted the verse regarding the Prophets and Writings,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the ‘matters’ that are the subject of this verse, which God gave man to engage in, were the books of the Prophets and Writings.</i> as had Israel merited, they would read only the five books of the Torah, just five books. The books of the Prophets and Writings were given to them only so they would exert themselves in their study and in the Torah, and perform mitzvot and acts of righteousness, in order to receive a proper reward. The Rabbis say: Even so, “in which to engage,” – they receive reward for them, as they do for the five books of the Torah.<br>Rabbi Abbahu said: This is the pursuit of Torah, for a person studies Torah and forgets it. The Rabbis there, in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak from here,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis of Babylonia said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak from the land of Israel.</i> and Rabbi Tovya in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: It is for his own good that a person studies Torah and forgets, as were a person to study Torah and not forget it, one would engage in Torah study two or three years and would return to engage in his labor and never pay attention to it [again] for the rest of his life. Rather, because a person studies Torah and forgets it, he does not move or remove himself from matters of Torah.<br>The Rabbis say: This is the pursuit of robbery. Know that it is so, as the earlier generations, because they were engaged and steeped in robbery, as it is stated: “They trespass, and flocks they steal and graze” (Job 24:2) – see that they were eliminated from the world through water. But the tribes of Reuben and Gad, who distanced themselves from robbery; therefore, the Holy One blessed be He gave them their inheritance in a place where there is no robbery, as it is stated: Behold, the place is a place of livestock…” (Numbers 32:1).

Chapter 11

<b>“He made everything beautiful in its time; the world, too, He has placed in their heart, but so that man will not discover the work that God has performed from beginning to end” (Ecclesiastes 3:11).</b><br>“He made everything beautiful in its time.” Rabbi Tanḥhuma said: The world was created at its appointed time; it was not fit to have been created earlier, but at its proper time it was created, as it is stated: “He made everything beautiful in its time.” Rabbi Abbahu said: From here [it is derived] that the Holy One blessed be He created worlds and destroyed them, created worlds and destroyed them, until he created this [world], and said: ‘These please Me and those did not please Me.’ Rabbi Elazar says: This opening is open to the depths,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The following is a clear proof to what Rabbi Abbahu stated above (Maharzu).</i> as it is stated: “God saw everything that He made, and, behold, it was very good” (Genesis 1:31).<br>Had another said: “He made everything beautiful in its time,” I would say: This one, who never ate a piece of bread in his life, says: “He made everything beautiful in its time”? However, Solomon, because it is written in his regard: “Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty <i>kor</i> of choice flour…” (I Kings 5:2), for him it is appropriate to say: “He made everything beautiful in its time.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Others who did not experience luxury might be easily impressed; if Solomon, who lived a life of incredible luxury, praised all that God created, that is a more significant compliment.</i><br>Another matter, had another said: “Vanity of vanities, said Kohelet…” (Ecclesiastes 1:2), I would have said: This one, who never acquired even two <i>perutot</i> worth [of property] in his life, he ridicules all the property in the world and says: “Vanity of vanities”? However, this one, Solomon, of whom it is written: “The king made the silver in Jerusalem as stones…” (I Kings 10:27), but they were not stolen, as they were ten cubit stones and eight cubit stones. The weights during the reign of Solomon were made of gold, as it is stated: “None of silver, as it was not considered anything during the reign of Solomon” (I Kings 10:21), for him it is appropriate to say: “Vanity of vanities.” Why did he say: “Vanity of vanities”? He saw the world and what would ultimately occur.<br>Had another said: “All residents of the earth are considered as nothing” (Daniel 4:32),<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">This was stated by Nebuchadnezzar in praise of God.</i> I would have said: Is it appropriate for this one, who has never had dominion over two flies to say: “All residents of the earth are considered as nothing”? It is more [significant now that] it was [stated by] the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who had dominion over the entire world, as it is stated: “I have given him all the beasts of the field, as well” (Jeremiah 28:14) to serve him. [This is also evident] from what is written [regarding Nebuchadnezzar]: “Everywhere the sons of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens dwell, He has given into your hand and established your rule over all of them” (Daniel 2:38). For this one it is appropriate to say: “All residents of the earth are considered as nothing.”<br>Had another of the wise men of the nations of the world said the verse: “Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods” (Exodus 18:11), I would have said: This one, who does not know the nature of idol worship, says: “Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods”? However, it is Yitro who said: “Now I know that the Lord is greater [than all gods],” [although] he engaged in many forms of idol worship, as Rabbi Yishmael taught: Reuel, who is Yitro, did not leave any form of idol worship in the world that he did not seek and serve, as it is written: “Woe unto us. Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods [that smote the Egyptians]” (I Samuel 4:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This verse was stated by the Philistines when preparing to face the Israelites in battle, upon realizing that the ark of the covenant was brought to the Israelite camp. Thus, it is not immediately clear what this verse adds to the midrash, and there are some commentaries who suggest it should be removed. Some suggest that this verse is offered as a contrast to Jethro. The Philistines recognized God and His power, yet assumed that He was just one of many gods, and therefore perhaps other gods to deliver them from Him. Jethro, on the other hand, repudiated all other gods (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> [Yitro] then said: “[Now I know that the Lord is greater] than all gods,” and ultimately converted and conceded to the Holy One blessed be He; for him it is appropriate to say: “Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods…” – He repented before the Holy One blessed be He, and He accepted him and established him [as a model] for Israel for the generations.<br>Had a prophet and wise man arisen and said: “The Rock, His actions are perfect [for all His ways are justice]” (Deuteronomy 32:4) other than Moses our master, [one might have said that he does not really know God’s ways. But in the case of Moses] because it is written in his regard: “He informed Moses of His ways, the children of Israel of His feats” (Psalms 103:7), for this one it is appropriate to say: “The Rock, [His actions] are perfect.”<br>Had another person come and rebuked Israel, I would have said: Shall a person who ate and drank from them and derived benefit from them, rebuke them? Rather, Moses, in whose regard it is written: “I have not taken one donkey from them” (Numbers 16:15), for this one it is appropriate to rebuke Israel. That is what is written: “These are the words that Moses spoke to all of Israel beyond the Jordan…” (Deuteronomy 1:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">All the places mentioned in the continuation of this verse are allusions to events for which Moses reprimanded the children of Israel.</i>
Another matter, “He made everything beautiful in its time” – Rabbi Bon stated two approaches regarding the following. Rabbi Bon said: Abraham was worthy to have been created before Adam, the first man, but the Holy One blessed be He said: If I create Abraham first, if he sins, there will be no one to come to make amends after him. Rather, I will create Adam, and if he sins, Abraham will come after him and make amends.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the verse: “He made everything beautiful in its time.”</i> Rabbi Bon said another [source for this idea]: It is written: “The greatest man among the giants” (Joshua 14:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">This is interpreted as a reference to Abraham.</i> Abraham was worthy to have been created first, as it is stated: “The greatest man among the giants.” Why is he called “greatest”? It is because he was worthy to have been created first, but the Holy One blessed be He said: If I create Abraham first, if he sins, there will be no one to come after him to make amends. Rather, I will create Adam, the first man, and if he sins, Abraham will come and make amends after him.<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Some cite a parable; to what is this matter analogous? [It is analogous] to one who had a substantial beam in his residence, in his house. Where would he place it? Would he not place it in the middle of the great hall, so that it would be able to support the beams in front of it and the beams that are behind it? So too, why did the Holy One blessed be He create Abraham our patriarch in the middle? So that he could provide support for the generations that preceded him and the generations that succeeded him. Rabbi Levi said: One brings a proper wife into the house of an improper wife, but one does not bring an improper wife into the house of a proper wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, Abraham was created after Adam in order to have a positive impact on the world that Adam had previously tarnished. Had Abraham been created first, Adam would have negated the positive impact that Abraham made on the world.</i><br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Adam the first man was worthy to have had the Torah given through him, as it is stated: “This is the book of the generations of Adam. [On the day that God created man, in the likeness of God He made him]” (Genesis 5:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the “book” in the verse as a reference to the Torah.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: Adam is my handiwork, will I not give him the Torah so that he may toil in it? Then He said: If six mitzvot were given him and he was unable to keep them and observe them, were I to give him six hundred and thirteen mitzvot – two hundred and forty-eight positive commandments and three hundred and sixty-five prohibitions – all the more so will he not keep them. That is why it is written: “He said to Adam [<i>la’adam</i>]” (Job 28:28) – not Adam [<i>lo adam</i>], I will not give them to Adam. To whom will I give them? I will give them to his descendants.<br>Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanan said: Adam the first man was worthy of having twelve tribes emerge from him, as it is written: “This [<i>zeh</i>] is the book of the generations of Adam” (Genesis 5:1) – <i>zayin</i> – seven, <i>heh</i> –five, twelve tribes, this is the numerical value of “<i>zeh</i> is the book of the generations of Adam.” The Holy One blessed be He said: Adam is My handiwork, will I not give him twelve tribes? He then said: If I gave him two sons and one rose and killed his brother, had I given him twelve sons, all the more so. That is why it written: “He said to Adam [<i>la’adam</i>]” (Job 28:28), not Adam [<i>lo adam</i>], I will not give them to Adam. To whom will I give them? I will give them to Jacob the righteous.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: At the time when they departed from Egypt, The Israelites were worthy for the Torah to have been given to them immediately, but the Holy One blessed be He said: The radiance of My children has not yet come; they have emerged from the enslavement of mortar and bricks and cannot receive the Torah immediately. To what is this matter comparable? [It is comparable] to a king whose son arose from his illness and they said to him: ‘Let your son go to his academy.’ He said: ‘The radiance of my son has not yet come; rather, let him be indulged for two or three months with food and drink and recover, and then he will go to his academy.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The radiance of my children has not yet come, they have emerged from the enslavement of mortar and bricks, and I will give them the Torah? Rather, let My children be indulged for two or three months with manna, a spring, and quails, and then I will give them the Torah.’ When? In the third month.<br>Rabbi Beivai, Rabbi Aivu, and Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon: At the time when they departed from Egypt, the Israelites were worthy to enter the Land immediately, but the trees were ancient, from the days of Noah. The Holy One blessed be He said: Shall I bring the Israelites into a wasteland? Rather, I will take them on a circuitous path through the wilderness for forty years so that the Canaanites will rise and chop down the old ones and plant new ones, so [the Israelites] would enter the land and find it filled with blessings.<br>Rabbi says: Even for matters of transgression it is “beautiful in its time.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">“He made everything beautiful in its time” alludes to the fact that even the effect of a transgression is influenced by its timing.</i>
Another matter, “He made everything beautiful in its time” – Rabbi Berekhya said that Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: The schism that was between Reḥavam and Yerovam was fitting to have been between David and Sheva ben Bikhri, but the Holy One blessed be He said: The Temple has not yet been constructed and I am introducing a schism in the kingdom of the House of David? Rather, let the Temple be constructed and then, what will ultimately happen, will happen.<br>Rabbi Binyamin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “The world, too, He has placed in their heart” (Ecclesiastes 3:11) – He placed in their heart love of the world. Rabbi Yonatan said: He has placed in their heart fear of the angel of death. Neḥemya, son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, said: “And behold it was very good” (Genesis 1:31). “And behold it was...good,” this is man; “and behold it was…good,” this is the good inclination, “very,” this is the evil inclination. Is the evil inclination “very good”? It is to teach you that were it not for the evil inclination, man would not build a house, would not marry a wife, and would not beget children, as Solomon says: “[I saw all toil and all skilled action;] that it is man’s envy of his neighbor” (Ecclesiastes 4:4).<br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: “The world, too, He has placed in their heart” – He placed in their heart love of the world, He placed in their heart love of young children. To what is this matter analogous? [It is analogous] to a king who had two sons, one big and one small. The big one cleans and the small one sullies; nevertheless, he loves the small one more than the big one.<br>Rabbi Aḥva son of Rabbi Zeira said: “The world [<i>ha’olam</i>],” the ineffable name was concealed [<i>ho’olam</i>] from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ha’olam</i> is written in the verse without the <i>vav</i> such that it can be read <i>ho’olam</i>.</i> This is analogous to a king who made a feast [and] invited guests. Once they ate and drank, they said to him: ‘Give us swords and spears and we will play with them.’ He gave them myrtle branches and they struck each other and wounded each other. The king said to them: ‘If, when I gave you myrtle branches, this is what you did, had I given you swords and spears, all the more so.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If, at a time when I concealed the ineffable name from them, they killed with appellations,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">By invoking names of God in cursing other people.</i> had I given and revealed to them the ineffable name, all the more so.’ There was a Persian woman who cursed her son with one element of the ineffable name. Shmuel heard her and said: ‘Go prepare a shroud for him.’<br>Rabbi Ḥanina had knowledge of the ineffable name. When his death approached, he said: ‘Is there a person here to whom I can entrust it?’ They said: ‘Eneini bar Naḥshon is here.’ He sent for him and he came, and his own son entered and hid under the bed. When he was about to transmit it, that child sneezed. His father [Rabbi Ḥanina] said: ‘Go out of here. You are not worthy to hear it, and this one is not worthy to receive it.’<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Ḥanina said to his son that he must leave because he is not worthy to hear it, and he also took this as a sign that he should not reveal the name to Eneini (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>One doctor in Tzippori had knowledge of the ineffable name. When his death approached, he said: ‘Is there a person here to whom I can entrust it?’ They said: ‘Pinḥas bar Ḥama is here.’ He sent for him and he came. [The doctor] asked him [a question] and said to him: ‘Have you ever taken anything from a Jew?’ He said to him: ‘I have taken first tithe.’ [The doctor] resolved not to entrust it to him, saying: ‘Perhaps he will demand something from a person and he will not give it to him, and he will become angry with him and kill him.’ It is taught, one does not entrust the name to just any person, and not to one who has lived half his life, but rather, to one who has lived most of his life. In addition, one entrusts it only standing, and one entrusts it only in a place of purity, and near water. Initially, they would entrust it to any person. When the sinners became more prevalent, they instituted that it should be entrusted only to the modest among the priests, and the modest among the priests would obscure it in the melody of the priests.<br>Rabbi Tarfon said: One time I ascended to the platform with Samson, my mother’s brother, and I cocked my ear in the direction of the High Priest, but he obscured it in the melody of the priests. And Rabbi Tarfon said: One time I heard it and I fell on my face. Those nearby, when they hear it, fall on their faces and say: “Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever.” These and those<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Those nearby and those farther away</i> would not move from there until the time when it was forgotten [<i>shenitalem</i>] from them, as it is stated: “This is My name forever [<i>le’olam</i>]” (Exodus 3:15), <i>le’elem</i> is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">It is written without a <i>vav</i>, such that it can be read <i>le’elem</i>, meaning for concealment.</i> To what purpose? “But so that man will not discover the work that God has performed from beginning to end” (Ecclesiastes 3:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This is to prevent people from discovering the secrets of Creation.</i>

<b>“I know that everything that God does, it will be forever, one cannot add to it, nor can one subtract from it; God did so, so they would fear before Him” (Ecclesiastes 3:14).</b><br>“I know that everything that God does, it will be forever…” Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: It would have been fitting for Adam, the first man, to have lived and endured forever.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">As the verse states that “everything God does, it will be forever,” and God created Adam.</i> Why was death imposed upon him? “God did so, so they would fear before Him.”<br>Rabbi Elazar said: From the beginning of the creation of the world it is stated: “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered” (Genesis 1:9). To what purpose? “And let the dry land appear” (Genesis 1:9). Why, then, is it written: “He calls upon the waters of the sea and pours them on the face of the earth; the Lord is His name” (Amos 9:6)? [He did so] twice, once in the generation of the flood and once in the generation of the dispersion, because “God did so, so they would fear before Him.”<br>Reish Lakish said: It is written: “This entire matter that I command you, you shall take care to perform, do not add to it and do not subtract from it” (Deuteronomy 13:1). But the righteous add to it and do not subtract from it. Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: From here [it may be derived] that an altar outside the Temple can be permitted only by a prophet, and Elijah stood and sacrificed at the peak of the Carmel.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Once the Temple was constructed it became prohibited to offer a sacrifice in any other place. However, Elijah the prophet did so on Mount Carmel in a confrontation with idolatrous priests, in order to demonstrate to the people the truth of God and the falsehood of idolatry. See I Kings chapter 18.</i> Rabbi Samlai of Broyera said: [Elijah] said to Him: “It was by Your word that I performed all these matters” (I Kings 18:36).<br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: It is written: “Your house and your kingdom will remain steadfast” (II Samuel 7:16). When? “If your descendants observe My covenant…” (Psalms 132:12). If not, “I will exact retribution for their transgression with a rod” (Psalms 89:33). Rabbi Yudan said: Great is fear [of God], as the heavens and the earth were created only due to fear; that is what is written: “God did so, so they would fear before Him.” Rabbi Yirmeya said: Great is fear, as Solomon concluded two books that he wrote with nothing other than fear. That is what is written in the book of Proverbs: “Grace is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised” (Proverbs 31:30). In this book, it is written: “The end of the matter, all having been heard: fear God [and keep His commandments, for this is all of man]” (Ecclesiastes 12:13).<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish was ascending from Ḥamat Gader, and Rabbi Yonatan encountered him. [R’ Yonatan] said to him: ‘How does my master interpret these verses?’ [Reish Lakish] transmitted the matter to him and this is how these verses are read.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the verses the midrash will now quote. The common theme is that the natural world is meant to maintain its basic structure, as indicated by the verse: “I know that everything that God does, it will be forever.”</i> The Holy One blessed be He decreed that the heavenly shall be the heavenly and the earthly shall be the earthly. Moses rose and transformed the heavenly into the earthly and the earthly into the heavenly. That is what is written: “Moses ascended to God” (Exodus 19:3); “The Lord descended on Mount Sinai” (Exodus 19:20).<br>Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that the earthly shall eat and drink and that the heavenly shall not eat and shall not drink. Abraham rose and made the heavenly eat and drink; that is what is written: “He stood over them under the tree and they ate” (Genesis 18:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash assumes that Abraham’s guests, whom he had given to eat, were angels.</i> Were they eating? Rabbi Natan said: They appeared to be eating; each bit would disappear in turn. Moses rose and made the earthly not eat and drink; that is what is written: “He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights, he did not eat bread and he did not drink water” (Exodus 34:28).<br>Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that sea shall be sea and that dry land shall be dry land. Moses rose and transformed sea into dry land. That is what is written: “The children of Israel came into the midst of the sea on dry land” (Exodus 14:16). Elisha, the disciple of his disciple, transformed dry land into sea. That is what is written: “Make this valley full of trenches…[that valley will be filled with water]” (II Kings 3:16–17).<br>Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that the heavens shall laud him, as it is stated: “The heavens relate the glory of God” (Psalms 19:2). Moses rose and silenced them, as it is stated: “Listen heavens, and I will speak” (Deuteronomy 32:1). Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that the sun and the moon shall laud him, as it is stated: “From the rising of the sun until its setting, the name of God is praised [<i>mehulal</i>]” (Psalms 113:3); it is written <i>mehalel</i> [praises].<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The word praised [<i>mehulal</i>] is written without a <i>vav</i>, such that it can be vocalized <i>mehalel</i> [praises]. Thus, instead of the verse stating “the name God is praised,” the verse can be read “the name of God it praises.”</i> Joshua, [Moses’s] disciple, rose and silenced them, as it is stated: “Sun, stand still in Givon; and Moon, in the valley of Ayalon” (Joshua 10:12).<br>Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that summer shall be summer and that winter shall be winter. Samuel rose and transformed summer into winter, as it is stated: “Is it not wheat harvest today? [I will call to the Lord and He will send thunder and rain]” (I Samuel 12:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In the land of Israel, it generally rains only during the winter. The wheat harvest occurs in late spring.</i> Elijah rose and transformed winter into summer, as it is stated: “There shall not be dew or rain these years, except by my word” (I Kings 17:1).<br>Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that day shall be day and night shall be night. Jacob, our patriarch, rose and transformed day into night, as it is stated: “He encountered the place, and stayed the night there, because the sun had set [<i>ki va</i>]” (Genesis 28:11); in fact, He extinguished [<i>kava</i>] the sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">God made the sun set early so that Jacob would spend the night in that location.</i> The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He set the sun prematurely and spoke with him in private. This is analogous to a friend of the king who would visit him infrequently. The king would attend to all the residents of the province on his request, and he would say: ‘Extinguish the torches and lamps so I can speak with my friend in private.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He concealed the sun prematurely and spoke with Jacob in private. Deborah and Barak rose and transformed night into day. That is what is written: “Deborah and Barak ben Avinoam sang…on that day” (Judges 5:1). Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Ḥilkiyya [said] in the name of Rabbi Simon: Six miracles were performed on that day: On that day they came,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The people came to Deborah to ask for help in the war against the Canaanites.</i> on that day they sent for him<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">She sent for Barak.</i> and he sent.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Barak sent messengers to marshal the forces.</i> On that day they waged war. On that day Sisera was killed. On that day they distributed the spoils. On that day they recited a song, as it is stated: “Deborah and Barak ben Avinoam sang…on that day.”<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">These events, some of which individually took longer than the average length of a day, all took place on the same miraculously lengthy day.</i>

Chapter 15

<b>“What has been, already is, and what will be has already been; and God seeks the pursued” (Ecclesiastes 3:15).</b><br>“What has been, already is” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: If a person says to you: Is it possible that the entire world was water [and the world’s water was gathered] into water?<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">God gathered the water that covered the land into the oceans (see Genesis 1:9); but how is that possible given that there was already water in the oceans?</i> Say to him: ‘It “already is.”’ The ocean is entirely water in water.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Even though it is full of water, rivers stream into it and it does not overflow.</i><br>“And what will be has already been…” – if a person will say to you: ‘Is it possible that the Holy One blessed be He is destined to transform sea into dry land?’ Say to him: ‘It “has already been.”’ Did He did not do so by means of Moses, as it is stated: “The children of Israel went on dry land” (Exodus 14:29), and it is written: “Now raise your staff…” (Exodus 14:16), and it is written: “And the children of Israel will come into the sea on dry land” (Exodus 14:16).<br>If a person will say to you: ‘Is it possible that had Adam, the first man, not sinned, he would have lived and endured forever?’ Say to him: ‘It “already is,”’ – Elijah, may he be remembered for good, who never sinned, lives and endures. “And what will be has already been” – if a person will say to you: ‘Is it possible that the Holy One blessed be He is destined to revive the dead?’ Say to him: ‘It “has already been,”’ He already revived the dead by means of Elijah, by means of Elisha, and by means of Ezekiel.<br>Rabbi Aḥa [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥalafta: Everything that the Holy One blessed be He is destined to perform and to innovate in His world in the future, He has already performed partially by means of a prophet in this world. It is I<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase, and the coming phrases, are stated from the perspective of God.</i> who am destined to turn the sea into dry land; I have already done so in this world, [as it is stated]: “Now raise your staff…” (Exodus 14:16), It is I who am destined to remember the barren; I have already remembered by means of Abraham, as it is stated: “God remembered Sarah…” (Genesis 21:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">God informed Sarah of this fact through a prophecy granted to Abraham (Maharzu).</i> It is I who am destined to revive the dead; I have already revived by means of Elijah, Elisha, and Ezekiel. It is I who am destined to cause kings to prostrate themselves to you; I have already done it for you by means of Daniel, as Nebuchadnezzar prostrated himself to Daniel, as it is stated: “Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and he prostrated himself to Daniel” (Daniel 2:46). It is I who am destined to open the eyes of the blind in the future; I have already done so by means of Elisha, as it is stated: “The Lord opened the eyes of the lad” (II Kings 6:17).<br>“And God seeks the pursued” – Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: God will always seek [to save] the pursued. You find a righteous man pursuing a righteous man; “and God seeks the pursued.” A wicked man pursuing a righteous man; “and God seeks the pursued.” A wicked man pursuing a wicked man; “and God seeks the pursued.” God seeks the pursued in any circumstance.<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon, in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Nehorai: The Holy One blessed be He always seeks the blood of the pursued from the pursuers.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">He holds the pursuers accountable for their actions, and He grants favor to the pursued.</i> Know that it is so; Abel was pursued by Cain, and the Holy One blessed be He chose only Abel, as it is stated: “The Lord turned to Abel and to his offering” (Genesis 4:4). Noah was pursued by the members of his generation, and the Holy One blessed be He chose only Noah, as it is stated: “For you I have seen righteous before Me” (Genesis 7:1). Abraham was pursued by Nimrod, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Abraham, as it is stated: “You are the Lord God who chose Abram” (Nehemiah 9:7). Isaac was pursued by the Philistines, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Isaac, as it is stated: “They said: We have seen that the Lord has been with you” (Genesis 26:28). Jacob was pursued by Esau, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Jacob, as it is stated: “For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself, Israel as His treasure” (Psalms 135:4). Joseph was pursued by his brothers, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Joseph, as it is stated: “He established it as testimony for Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt” (Psalms 81:6).<br>Moses was pursued by Pharaoh, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Moses, as it is stated: “Were it not for Moses, His chosen, who stood in the breach before Him” (Psalms 106:23). David was pursued by Saul, and the Holy One blessed be He chose David, as it is stated: “He chose David His servant and took him from the sheepfolds” (Psalms 78:70). Saul was pursued by the Philistines, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Saul, as it is stated: “Have you seen the one whom the Lord has chosen?” (I Samuel 10:24). Israel was pursued by the nations, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Israel, as it is stated: “[For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; the Lord your God] has chosen you as a treasured people” (Deuteronomy 7:6). Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra said: The same is true regarding offerings. The Holy One blessed be He said: A bull is pursued by a lion, a goat by a leopard, a sheep by a wolf; do not sacrifice the pursuers before Me, but rather the pursued, as it is stated: “A bull, a sheep, or a goat…[it shall be accepted as a fire offering before the Lord]” (Leviticus 22:27).

Chapter 16

<b>“Moreover, I have seen, under the sun, in the place of judgment there is wickedness, and in the place of justice there is wickedness” (Ecclesiastes 3:16).</b><br>“Moreover, I have seen, under the sun, in the place of judgment…” – Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say: “In the place of judgment there is wickedness” – in the place where the Great Sanhedrin convenes and determine rulings for Israel, “there is wickedness,” as it is stated: “All the princes of the king of Babylon came and sat at the Middle Gate” (Jeremiah 39:3) – the place where the <i>halakhot</i> are determined.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The word for Middle Gate [<i>hatavekh</i>] is similar to the term for determine [<i>ḥotekh</i>].</i> “There is wickedness,” there sat “Nergal Saretzer, Samgar Nevo, Sarsekhim the chief official; Nergal Saretzer the chief magician, and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon” (Jeremiah 39:3). The parable says: Where the master hung his weapon, the insolent shepherd hangs his jug.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The place formerly used for a glorious purpose has now been appropriated for an inglorious one.</i> The Divine Spirit is screaming: “And in the place of justice, there is wickedness” – the place in whose regard it is stated: “Justice would lodge in it, but now murderers” (Isaiah 1:21), they commit murders. There they killed Zekharya and Uriya.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Because Israel committed atrocities in the place that should have been set aside for justice, the members of the Great Sanhedrin were replaced in that location by conquering Babylonian officers.</i><br>Rabbi Yonatan raised a dilemma before Rabbi Aḥa: In which place did they kill Zekharya, in the Israelite courtyard or in the women’s courtyard? He said to him: Neither in the women’s courtyard nor in the Israelite courtyard, but rather in the priests’ courtyard. They did not treat his blood like the blood of a gazelle or like the blood of a deer. Regarding the blood of a deer and a gazelle it is written in the Torah: “He shall spill its blood and cover it with dirt” (Leviticus 17:13). But the righteous Zekharya, they did not treat his blood like the blood of a deer and a gazelle; rather they spilled it on the stones, as it is written: “For its blood was in its midst; it placed it upon a bare rock. [It did not pour it on the ground to cover it with dirt]” (Ezekiel 24:7). To what purpose? It was “to arouse fury to take vengeance, [I placed its blood upon the bare rock so it would not be covered]” (Ezekiel 24:8),<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">God brought it about that Zekharya’s blood would not be covered in order to motivate the Babylonians to take vengeance upon the Israelites.</i> and in that regard it is written: “Remember your Creator in the days of your youth” (Ecclesiastes 12:1).<br>You find that when Nevuzaradan ascended to destroy Jerusalem, the Holy One blessed be He had indicated to that blood that it should seethe and rise for two hundred and fifty-two years, from [the time of] Yoash to [the time of] Zedekiah. What did they do? They swept all possible dirt and formed every possible pile [upon it], but it would not rest; the blood was seething and boiling. The Holy One blessed be He said to the blood: ‘This is the time that you will collect your debt.’ When Nevuzaradan ascended and saw it, he said to them: ‘What is the nature of this blood that seethes in this way?’ They said to him: ‘It is the blood of bulls, rams, and sheep that they were slaughtering and sacrificing.’ He brought bulls, rams, and sheep and slaughtered them onto it, but it did not quiet, did not rest, and did not stop. He immediately took them and hanged them on a pole. He said to them: ‘Tell me what is the nature of this blood, and if not, I will comb you with a comb of iron.’ They said to him: ‘Since the Holy One blessed be He wishes to demand [vengeance for] His blood from us, we will reveal it to you.’ They said to him: ‘He was a priest, a prophet, and a judge, who would prophesy about us all these actions that you are performing against us. But we did not believe him and we rose against him and killed him for rebuking us.’<br>Immediately [Nevuzaradan] brought eighty thousand young priests and slaughtered them onto [the blood], but it did not rest. The blood emerged until it reached Zekharya’s grave. [Nevuzaradan] then brought the Great Sanhedrin and the lesser Sanhedrin and slaughtered them onto it, but it did not rest. At that moment, that wicked one [Nevuzaradan] came and shouted at the blood, and said to it: ‘What good are you, and in what way is your blood superior to the blood of these? Do you wish to eliminate your entire nation because of you?’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He became filled with mercy for them, and He said: ‘If this cruel wicked one, son of a wicked one, who ascended to destroy My house, became filled with mercy for them, I, of whom it is written: “The Lord, the Lord, God, merciful and gracious” (Exodus 34:6), and it is written in My regard: “The Lord is good to all, and His mercy is upon all His creations” (Psalms 145:9), all the more so.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He intimated to that blood, and it was absorbed in its place.<br>Rabbi Yudan said: The Israelites performed seven transgressions at that moment:<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">When they killed Zekharya.</i> They killed a priest, a prophet, and a judge, they spilled innocent blood, they [brought] impurity to the [Temple] courtyard, and it was Shabbat and Yom Kippur.<br>Rabbi Yehoshua interpreted the verse regarding the sin of the Golden Calf. “In the place of judgment there is wickedness” – in the place where Moses implemented the attribute of justice, as it is stated: “Go to and fro from gate to gate in the camp [and each man kill his brother]” (Exodus 32:27). “There is wickedness,” as it is stated: “The Lord afflicted the people…” (Exodus 32:35). The Divine Spirit was shouting: “In the place of justice there is wickedness” – in the place where I treated them as righteous ones and called them divine, as it is stated: “I said: You are divine and all of you are sons of the celestial” (Psalms 82:6). “There is wickedness” – there they were corrupted and crafted the [Golden] Calf. As it is stated: “They prostrated themselves to it” (Exodus 32:8).<br>Rabbi Yuda interpreted the verse regarding Shitim. “In the place of judgment there is wickedness” – in the place where the attribute of justice acted in Shitim, as it is stated: “Take all the leaders of the people and hang them before the Lord against the sun” (Numbers 25:4). “There is wickedness,” as it stated: “The dead in the plague were twenty-four thousand” (Numbers 25:9). The Divine Spirit was shouting and saying: “And in the place of justice there is wickedness” – in the place where I treated them as righteous regarding the curses of Bilam, and I transformed them into blessings, as it is stated: “The Lord your God turned the curse into a blessing for you” (Deuteronomy 23:6), “there is wickedness,” there they corrupted and sinned, as it is stated: “Israel resided in Shitim [and the people began to engage in licentiousness]” (Numbers 25:1).<br>Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yitzḥak, Rabbi Levi said two matters [are stated in verses] regarding the hand [of God], and two matters regarding the right hand [of God]. Two matters regarding the hand [of God], as it is written: “In whose hand is the life of every living being…” (Job 12:10), and it is written: “And My hand grasps judgment” (Deuteronomy 32:41). And two matters regarding the right hand [of God], as it is stated: “From His right hand, a fiery law to them” (Deuteronomy 33:2), and it is written: “Your right hand is filled with righteousness” (Psalms 48:11). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The Holy One blessed be He said to the soul: Soul, I strengthened you very much and commanded you, and said: “Just be strong not to eat the blood [because the blood is the soul]” (Deuteronomy 12:23), and [nonetheless the soul] goes out, violently robs, sins, and subjects itself to the attribute of justice, and emerges from the attribute of justice and sins,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">It sins again after receiving punishment for its previous sins.</i> as it is stated: “Speak to the children of Israel saying: ‘If a soul sins unwittingly…’” (Leviticus 4:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The verse assigns responsibility for even unwitting sins to the soul (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>). Alternatively, the verse may also be understood as a rhetorical question, as though to say: After all this, can a soul yet sin, even unwittingly? (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>

Chapter 17

<b>“I said in my heart: The righteous and the wicked, God will judge, as there is a time for every purpose and for every action there” (Ecclesiastes 3:17).</b><br>“I said in my heart: The righteous and the wicked, God will judge.” Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: God will judge the righteous like the wicked; a robber goes up to the gallows and Rabbi Akiva goes up to the gallows. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said: God judges the righteous via the wicked. The wicked Turnusrofus judged Rabbi Akiva, and when Trajan killed Luleyanus and his brother Pappos in Laodicea, he said to them: ‘Are you not from the people of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, and I am from the grandchildren of Nebuchadnezzar? Let the God of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya come and rescue you from my hands.’ They said to him: ‘Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya were upright, and King Nebuchadnezzar was a decent king, and he was worthy for a miracle to be performed through him. But we are people who are liable [to punishment] by the Omnipresent and you are a king who is liable [to punishment], and you are unworthy for a miracle to be performed through you. We are liable to be executed [due to our sins]. If you kill us, fine, and if not, the Omnipresent has many lions, bears, snakes, and scorpions through which people are killed. If you kill us, you are considered as nothing more than one of them; however, the Holy One blessed be He is destined to avenge our blood from your hands.’ It is said that they did not manage to move from there,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">After he executed them.</i> before a pair of emissaries arrived from Rome and removed his [Turnusrofus’s] brain with wooden clubs.<br>“As there is a time for every purpose and for every action there” – for every purpose there is a time, and for every time there is a purpose. “And for every action there” – in this world, what a person wishes, he does; however, he is held to account there.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">In the World to Come.</i>

Chapter 18

<b>“I said in my heart: It is by the speech of the sons of man that God has differentiated them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as animals” (Ecclesiastes 3:18).</b><br>“I said in my heart: It is by the speech of the sons of man” – by the matters of which the wicked speak in this world, for they curse and blaspheme in this world, and the Holy One blessed be He bestows tranquility upon them. To what purpose? “That God has differentiated [<i>levaram</i>] them,” to designate [<i>levarer</i>] the attribute of justice for the wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">In the World to Come.</i> “And that they may see that they themselves are but as animals,” to see and to show the world that the wicked are likened to animals, just as the animal is condemned to be killed and does not come to life in the World to Come, so too, the wicked, like the animals, are condemned to be killed and do not come to life in the World to Come.<br>Another matter, “it is by the speech of the sons of man” – by the matters of which the righteous speak in this world regarding asceticism, fasts, and suffering. To what purpose? “That God has differentiated [<i>levaram</i>] them,” to designate [<i>levarer</i>] for them [reward for] the measure of their righteousness. “And that they may see that they themselves are but as animals,” to see and to show the world how Israel is drawn after Him like animals, as it is stated: “Now, you are My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are Man” (Ezekiel 34:31). And just as this animal extends its neck for slaughter, so, too, the righteous, as it is stated: “For we are killed all day long for You…” (Psalms 44:23). Let this tradition be in your hand, anyone who performs a mitzva just before his death, it is as though his measure of righteousness was lacking only that mitzva, and he completed it. And one who performs a transgression just before his death, it is as though his measure of wickedness was lacking only that transgression, and he completed it. Both these and those go whole; these whole in the measure of their righteousness and those whole in the measure of their wickedness.<br>Rabbi Bon and Rabbi Yitzḥak, Rabbi Bon said: Is it not, just as I established prophets from Israel who are called man, as it is stated: “You are Man” (Ezekiel 34:31), did I not establish prophets for the idolaters who are called animals, as it is stated: “[Should I not have pity on Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than one hundred and twenty thousand people…] and many animals” (Jonah 4:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash assumes that the term people in this verse refers to those who were not overly wicked, and the term animals refers to the wicked people of Nineveh.</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak said:<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement opens the next section.</i>

Chapter 19

<b>“For the fate of the sons of man and the fate of the animal, there is one fate for them; like the death of this one, so is the death of that one, and there is one spirit for all. The superiority of man over animal is non-existent, as everything is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 3:19).</b><br>“For the fate of the sons of man and the fate of the animal” – is it not just like the fate of man, so is the fate of the animal? The Holy One blessed be He said: Is it not so that just as I decreed and said regarding man: “On the eighth day, you shall circumcise the flesh of his foreskin” (Leviticus 12:3), I decreed so regarding the animal, as it is stated: “From the eighth day onward it shall be accepted as a fire offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27)?<br>“The superiority of man over animal is non-existent [<i>ayin</i>], as everything is vanity.” What is <i>ayin</i>? Rav Naḥman ben Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He made an embellishment for his [man’s] bottom,<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The flesh is shaped such that the anal opening is not visible.</i> so that he would not be debased like an animal. Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Yudan, one said: He made for him a lock and a stool on it so he would not be debased like an animal.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">The references to a lock and stool refer to two functions of the buttocks: They obscure the anal opening and allow a person to sit comfortably.</i> And one said: He made padding for his bottom so he would not experience discomfort while sitting.<br>Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Ami, one said: He arranged burial for him, and one said: He arranged a coffin for him, and one said: He arranged a coffin and a shroud for him.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">God arranged for people to think to bury others in a respectable manner, which differentiates them from animals. In <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> (17:6) the text is: “One said: He arranged burial for him, and one said: He arranged a shroud for him.” This text better reflects the fact that only two Sages are cited (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>

Chapter 20

<b>“Everything goes to one place; everything was from the dust, and everything returns to the dust” (Ecclesiastes 3:20).</b><br>“Everything goes to one place…” – Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer says: Everything that the Holy One blessed be He created in the heavens, their origins are from the heavens, and everything that the Holy One blessed be He created on the earth, their origins are from the earth. What is the reason [for Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion]? [It is based on the verses:] “Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise Him in the heights, praise Him all his angels” (Psalms 148:1–2) until: “Praise the Lord from the earth, sea creatures and all depths, fire and hail, snow and vapor” (Psalms 148:7–8), until the end of the psalm. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Everything that the Holy One blessed be He created in the heavens and on the earth, their origins are from the heavens. Snow, even though it is written in its regard: “For He said to the snow, be on earth” (Job 37:6), its origins are only from the heavens, as it is stated: “Because, just as the rain and the snow fall from the heavens…” (Isaiah 55:10).<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef said: Everything that is in the heavens and on the earth, their origins are from the earth. Rain, even though it is written in its regard: “Because, just as the rain and the snow fall from the heavens…” – its origins are only from the earth. What is the reason? “A mist ascended from the earth [and watered the whole surface of the ground]” (Genesis 2:6). Rabbi Yudan cites it from here: “Everything goes to one place; [everything was from the dust].” Rabbi Naḥman said: Even the orb of the sun was created only from the earth, as it is stated: “Who says to the sun [<i>ḥeres</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ḥeres</i>, the term used in this verse for sun, typically means earthenware.</i> not to shine…” (Job 9:7).

<b>“Who knows the spirit of the sons of man? Does it go upward? And the spirit of the animal, does it go downward to the earth?” (Ecclesiastes 3:21).</b><br>“Who knows the spirit of the sons of man…?” It is taught: Both the soul of the righteous and the soul of the wicked, all of them ascend on High; however, the souls of the righteous are placed in the treasury, while the souls of the wicked are cast down to the earth, as Avigayil said to David, with divine inspiration: “May the soul of my lord be bound in the bond of life” (I Samuel 25:29). Could it be so even for the wicked? The verse states: “And may He cast the souls of your enemies as from the hollow of a slingshot” (I Samuel 25:29).<br>A noblewoman asked Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta, she said to him: ‘What is this that is written: “Who knows the spirit of the sons of man? Does it go upward?”’ He said to her: ‘These are the souls of the righteous that are placed in the treasury, as Avigayil said to David with divine inspiration: “May the soul of my lord be bound in the bond of life” (I Samuel 25:29). Could it be so even for the wicked? The verse states: “And may He cast the souls of your enemies as from the hollow of a slingshot” (I Samuel 25:29).’ She said to him: ‘And what is this that is written: “And the spirit of the animal, does it go downward to the earth?”’ He said to her: ‘These are the souls of the wicked, who descend to Gehenna below, as it is stated: “On the day of his descent to the netherworld I caused mourning, I covered the depths because of him” (Ezekiel 31:15).’

Chapter 22

<b>“I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his actions, as that is his portion; for who will bring him to see that which will be after him?” (Ecclesiastes 3:22).</b><br>“I saw that there is nothing better…for who will bring him to see?” Who will bring David to see what Solomon did? Who will bring Solomon to see what will be after him, what Reḥavam did?

Chapter 1

<b>“I returned and saw all the oppressions that are performed under the sun; and behold the tears of the oppressed, and they have no one to comfort them; and their oppressors possess power, but they have no one to comfort them” (Ecclesiastes 4:1).</b><br>“I returned and saw” – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis: Rabbi Yehuda says: These are the children who, due to the iniquities of their fathers, are taken during their lifetimes in this world. In the World to Come, they stand on the side of the group of the righteous, and their fathers stand on the side of the group of the wicked. They say before [God]: ‘Master of the universe, did we not die only due to the iniquities of our fathers? Let our fathers enter [the group of the righteous] on the basis of our merits.’ He says to them: ‘Your fathers sinned after you died, and their sins condemn them.’ Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The commentaries note that the words “ben Levi” appear to be out of place given that Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai was a <i>tanna</i> and preceded Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, a second-generation <i>amora</i>. It would make more sense for Rabbi Yehuda to be citing Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya, a <i>tanna</i> who preceded Rabbi Yehuda. Whenever classical rabbinic literature cites Rabbi Yehoshua without identifying which one, it is assumed to be Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya.</i> At that time Elijah the prophet, may he be remembered for good, will sit and teach them a defense, and say to them: ‘Say before Him: Master of the universe, which attribute is greater, the attribute of beneficence or the attribute of punishment? Say that the attribute of beneficence is greater and the attribute of punishment is lesser. We died due to the iniquities of our fathers. If the attribute of beneficence is greater, all the more so our fathers should come to us.’ [God] will say to them: ‘You have advocated well; they will come to you,’ as it is written: “They shall live with their children and return” (Zechariah 10:9), [teaching] that they return from descending to Gehenna and they are rescued due to the merit of their children. Therefore, every person is obligated to teach his son Torah, so that he will save him from Gehenna.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina interpreted the verse regarding those executed by the monarchy, who come to the life of the World to Come even though they do not confess.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Those wrongfully killed by ruthless governments enter the World to Come even if they are unable to confess their sins before death.</i> Rabbi Binyamin interpreted the verse regarding those who engage in Torah disingenuously.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to those who use their falsely derived status to oppress others (Rabbi David Luria).</i> The entire people think they are well versed in Bible, but they are not well versed in Bible; well versed in Mishna, but they are not well versed in Mishna.

These [the oppressed] are the <i>mamzerim</i> themselves, and who is it [who oppresses him]? It is the one who engaged in relations with a woman who is forbidden to him and begot him. What sin did this one [the <i>mamzer</i>] commit, and what is his connection to it? Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: Even the <i>mamzer</i> enters the World to Come, as it is written: “And behold the tears of the oppressed...” The Holy One blessed be He says: In this world they are unfit [to enter the community], but regarding the future, Zechariah said: I have seen it and they are pure gold, as it is stated: “And behold a candelabrum entirely of gold…and there are two olives upon it [with its bowl [<i>gulah</i>] at its top]” (Zechariah 4:2). Two <i>amora’im</i> [explain the latter phrase of the verse]; one says: Its exile [<i>gola</i>] and one says its Redeemer [<i>go’ala</i>]. The one who says <i>gola</i>, it is the exile in Babylon and the exile of the Divine Presence with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the phrase “its <i>gulah</i> at its top” means that God is with them in their exile.</i> The one who says <i>go’ala</i>, it is redemption, as it is written: “Our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is His name” (Isaiah 47:4), and it is written: “The one who breaks out will go up before them…[with the Lord at their head]” (Micah 2:13).

Chapter 2

<b>“I praise the dead who are already dead, more than the living who are still alive” (Ecclesiastes 4:2).</b><br>“I praise the dead who are already dead” – these are the generation of Enosh and the generation of the Flood; “more than the living who are still alive” – these are the Sodomites and the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The generations of Enosh and the Flood were destroyed and will never come back to life.

Chapter 3

<b>“Better than both of them is one who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil actions that are done under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 4:3).</b><br>“Better than both of them is one who has not yet been” – these are the one thousand generations that were in God’s mind to have created. How many of them were eliminated? Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: Nine hundred and seventy-four generations, as it is stated: “He commanded the matter for one thousand generations” (Psalms 105:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">God intended to give the Torah after one thousand generations, but He actually gave the Torah after just twenty-six generations.</i><br>Rabbi Yehoshua interpreted the verse regarding the Israelites at the time that they stood before Mount Sinai. Once they performed that act,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the Golden Calf</i> Moses did not leave any corner of the ground on the mountain upon which he did not prostrate himself in prayer asking for mercy upon Israel, but he was not answered. Five angels of destruction harassed him: Anger, Destruction, Annihilation, Wrath, and Fury. Moses was fearful of them. What did he do? He relied on the actions of the patriarchs, and immediately mentioned them and said: “Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel Your servants” (Exodus 32:13). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Moses, what claims do the patriarchs of the world have against Me? If I come to be exacting with them, I have claims against them. I have a claim against Abraham, who said: “How will I know that I will inherit it” (Genesis 15:8)? I have a claim against Isaac, as it is stated: “Isaac loved Esau” (Genesis 25:28), but I hated him, as it is stated: “And Esau I hated” (Malachi 1:3). I have a claim against Jacob, who said: “My way is hidden from the Lord” (Isaiah 40:27).’ Once [Moses] said: “To whom You took an oath by Yourself” (Exodus 32:13), for the sake of Your name, at that moment, the Holy One blessed be He was filled with mercy, as it is stated: “The Lord reconsidered…” (Exodus 32:14). Immediately, three of the angels of destruction, Anger, Destruction, and Annihilation, departed, and two remained: Wrath and Fury. That is what is written: “For I was in dread due to the Wrath and the Fury” (Deuteronomy 9:19). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, am I able to withstand the two of them? You bear one and I will bear one.’ That is what is written: “Arise, Lord, in Your wrath [<i>be’appekha</i>]…” (Psalms 7:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded to mean that God will arise against His angel, Wrath [<i>af</i>].</i> From where is it derived that Moses withstood one, the angel of Fury [<i>Ḥema</i>]?

He prayed twenty-four prayers, but it did not descend, until he said: “Remember the good deeds of David your servant” (II Chronicles 6:42), [and then] it descended immediately, as it is stated: “When Solomon concluded praying, the fire descended” (II Chronicles 7:1).

The one who said: He brought his coffin, that is what is written: “Remember the good deeds of David Your servant” (II Chronicles 6:42). It is regarding that moment that he said: “I praise the dead […more than the living]” (Ecclesiastes 4:2), like me and my associates.<br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon interpreted the verse regarding Ezekiel. When he stood in the valley and said: “Dry bones, heed the word of the Lord” (Ezekiel 37:4), immediately, “the bones came together, each bone to its bone…” (Ezekiel 37:7). He said to them: ‘Initially I said to you: “Heed the word of the Lord, house of Jacob” (Jeremiah 2:4), but you did not heed; and now you are heeding.

Chapter 5

<b>“The fool folds his hands and eats his flesh” (Ecclesiastes 4:5).</b><br>“The fool folds his hands” – To what is this matter analogous? To two people who were toiling in Torah; one toiled and flourished, and one toiled and abandoned it. The one who had toiled and abandoned it sees the one who flourished standing on the side of a group of the righteous, and he is standing on the side of a group of the wicked. Immediately, he “folds his hands and eats his flesh.”

Chapter 6

<b>“A handful of tranquility is better than two handfuls of toil and herding wind” (Ecclesiastes 4:6).</b><br>“A handful of tranquility is better” – one who studies <i>halakhot</i> and is familiar with them is better than one who studies <i>halakhot</i> and the hermeneutical principles but does not review them and familiarize himself with them. The parable says: One bound bird is better than one hundred that are flying. “And herding [<i>urut</i>] wind” – his wish [<i>re’utei</i>] is to be called “master of the <i>mekhiltot</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the <i>midrash</i> <i>halakha</i> on the book of Exodus, largely based on hermeneutical exposition of the verses.</i><br>Another matter: “A handful of tranquility is better” – one who performs minimal acts of charity with his own [funds] is better than one who steals, robs, or exploits others and performs great acts of charity from that of others. The parable says: She commits adultery for apples and distributes them to the poor. “And herding [<i>urut</i>] wind” – his wish [<i>re’utei</i>] is to be called “master of mitzvot.”<br>Another matter: “A handful of tranquility is better” – one who has ten gold pieces and conducts business and earns a livelihood from them is better than one who takes the property of others and squanders it and loses it. The parable says: It is not enough that he loses his own, but he loses that of others, what is his and what is not his. “And herding [<i>urut</i>] wind” – his wish [<i>re’utei</i>] is to be called a merchant.<br>Another matter: “A handful of tranquility is better” – one who rents one garden and eats its fruit is better than one who rents many gardens and leaves them fallow. The parable says: One who rents a garden will eat birds; one who rents many gardens, birds will eat them. “And herding [<i>urut</i>] wind” – his wish [<i>re’utei</i>] is to be called a property owner.<br>Rabbi Yaakov ben Rabbi Kurshai said: “A handful of tranquility is better” in the World to Come “than two handfuls of toil and herding wind” in this world. He would say: One hour of satisfaction in the World to Come is preferable to the entire life of this world, and one hour of repentance and good deeds in this world is preferable to the entire life of the World to Come, as the World to Come comes by virtue of this world.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: “A handful of tranquility is better” – this is the Shabbat day; “than two handfuls of toil and herding wind” – these are the seven days of action, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Israel is redeemed only thanks to Shabbat, as it is stated: “In stillness [<i>beshuva</i>] and quiet [<i>vanaḥat</i>] you will be saved” (Isaiah 30:15), with cessation from work and rest you will be saved. “And herding wind” – his wish is to be called one who works and eats.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: The trampling that the Holy One blessed be He trampled in the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “I will pass in the land of Egypt on that night” (Exodus 12:12), is better than two handfuls, than their two handfuls of furnace soot. Why? It is because in this one there is redemption and they were redeemed, and in this of furnace soot, they were not redeemed.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak interpreted the verse regarding the tribe of Gad and the tribe of Reuben who came to the Land of Israel and saw the amount of room for sowing that was in it, the amount of room for planting that was in it. They said: “A handful of tranquility is better” in the Land of Israel, “than two handfuls of toil” across the Jordan. They reconsidered and said: Did we not cause this to ourselves, did we not say: “Let this land be given to your servants” (Numbers 32:5)?<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “The cloud of incense will cover” (Leviticus 16:13). This cover, we do not know what it is, until David came and explained it, as it is stated: “You forgave the iniquity of Your people, [You covered all their sins]” (Psalms 85:3). The Holy One blessed be He, too, said: The poor person’s handful of the gift meal offering is dearer to Me than the High Priest’s two handfuls of the incense of the spices. Why? It is because this one comes for atonement and that one does not come for atonement, as it is written: “When a person [<i>venefesh</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The connotation is that it is as though the person in sacrificing his soul [<i>nefesh</i>] and thereby gaining atonement.</i> sacrifices a meal offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:1).

When they came to David, he agreed with them, and said: “Mount Solomon my son on the mule that is mine…” (I Kings 1:33).

<b>“Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king who no longer knows to receive admonition” (Ecclesiastes 4:13).</b><br>“Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king.” “Better is a poor and wise child” – this is the good inclination. Why is it called a child? Because it only associates with a person from the age of thirteen onward. Why is it called poor? It is because not everyone heeds it. Why is it called wise? It is because it guides people to the straight path. “Than an old and foolish king” – this is the evil inclination. Why is it called “king”? It is because everyone heeds it. Why is it called “old”? It is because it associates with him from his youth through his old age. Why is it called a “fool”? It is because it guides a person to an evil path. “Who no longer knows to receive admonition” – he<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the person who submits to the evil inclination.</i> does not know how much pain and how much suffering will afflict him, but he is not cautious in their regard.

Chapter 14

<b>“For he emerged from prison to reign, as also to his kingdom he was born poor” (Ecclesiastes 4:14).</b><br>“For he emerged from prison [<i>beit hasurim</i>] to reign” – as it [the evil inclination] entangles people as though among thorns [<i>seriata</i>]. “As also to his kingdom he was born poor” – with the kingship of the good inclination comes the beginning of the impoverishment of the evil inclination.<br>Another matter: “Better is a poor…child” (Ecclesiastes 4:13) – this is Abraham; “than an old and foolish king” (Ecclesiastes 4:13) – this is Nimrod. What is: “To the Shaveh Valley” (Genesis 14:17)? As there they all agreed [<i>hushvu</i>] and chopped down the cedars, and constructed a large platform, and enthroned him<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham</i> above upon it; and they were lauding him and saying: “Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God among us” (Genesis 23:6). “As also to his kingdom he was born poor” – with the kingship of Abraham comes the beginning of the impoverishment of Nimrod.<br>Another matter: “Better is a poor…child” (Ecclesiastes 4:13) – this is Joseph; “and wise” (Ecclesiastes 4:13) – as his wisdom sustained the entire world during the famine. “Than an old and foolish king” (Ecclesiastes 4:13) – this is Potifar. How many miracles did he see performed through [Joseph], but he was not admonished.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">He believed his wife’s false accusations against Joseph.</i> “For he emerged from prison to reign” – from Pharaoh’s jail he emerged a king, as it is stated: “I am Pharaoh, and without you no one will lift [his hand or foot in the entire land of Egypt] ” (Genesis 41:44).

Chapter 15

<b>“I saw all the living that walk under the sun, with the second child, who will stand in his stead” (Ecclesiastes 4:15).</b><br>“I saw all the living that walk under the sun” – these are the actions of the righteous. What caused them to be living? It is because they walk under the sun, “with the second child” – this is the good inclination.

Chapter 16

<b>“There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them; the latter ones, too, will not rejoice in him, as this too is vanity and herding wind” (Ecclesiastes 4:16).</b><br>“There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them” – there is no end to all the generations that were eliminated by the evil inclination. “The latter ones, too, will not rejoice in him”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The evil inclination</i> – because they heed it.

Chapter 17

<b>“Guard your feet when you go to the house of God, and draw near to heed. This is better than fools giving an offering, as they do not know to perform evil” (Ecclesiastes 4:17).</b><br>“Guard your feet when you go to the house of God” – it is taught: A person may not enter the Temple Mount with coins bound in his shawl, with dust that is on his feet, and with his money belt girded on the outside [of his clothing], as it is stated: “Guard your feet when you go [to the house of God].” Rabbi Yosei ben Yehuda says: “He came until before the king’s gate, as none may enter the king’s gate [in sackcloth]” (Esther 4:2) – if in honor of a king of flesh and blood this may not be done, in honor of the King, king of kings, all the more so.<br>Rabbi Ada ben Rabbi Shimon in the name of Rabbi Natan: A person must never stand in an elevated place and pray, but rather in a low place. What is the reason? “From the depths, I cried to you, Lord” (Psalms 130:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the phrase “guard your feet when you go to the house of God” is interpreted to mean that one must stand in prayer in a manner that demonstrates humility.</i><br>Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] says: A person must never pray when he needs to relieve himself, as it is stated: “Prepare to meet your God, Israel” (Amos 4:12). Rabbi Alexandri said: It is written: “Guard your feet [when you go to the house of God].” Rabbi Kerutzpi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: “Guard your feet” – from the drops between your legs. “When you go to the house of God,” be ritually pure.

It is in the case of urine; but in the case of excrement, if he can restrain himself, he may restrain himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase may be interpreted in accordance with the Gemara (<i>Berakhot</i> 23a) to mean: If he can restrain himself for the time it takes to walk four parasangs (72 minutes), he may pray (<i>Maharzu</i>).</i><br>Rabbi Abba said: “May your fount [<i>mekoraakha</i>] be blessed” (Proverbs 5:18) – in the house of your calling [<i>mekoraakh</i>], may you be blessed;<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In the place where you call out to God, i.e., the synagogue, be blessed, and be not degraded by a lack of cleanliness regarding bodily functions.</i> may your calling to the grave be blessed.<br>Shimon Sikhena was a shrewd man, and he would dig cisterns, ditches, and caves in Jerusalem. He said to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakai, ‘I am as great as you are.’ [Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakai] said to him: ‘Why?’ He said: ‘Because I engage in communal needs like you do.’ He said: ‘If a person comes to you for a judgment or a question, you say to him: Drink from this cistern as its water is clear and cold. Or if a woman asks you about her menstrual status, you say to her: Immerse yourself in this cistern, as its water purifies.’ He read this verse in his regard: “This is better than fools giving an offering, as they do not know to perform evil.”<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakai applied this verse to the unlearned Shimon Sikhena, intimating that he did not know the difference between pure and impure such that he could even make such a statement.</i><br>Huna bar Geniva said: Reciting <i>Shema</i> at its appointed time is dearer than one thousand burnt offerings sacrificed by the fool. Why? “As they do not know to perform evil” – the fool does not know how to distinguish between one vow and another vow. From where is it [derived]? It is [derived] from Yiftaḥ.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Yiftaḥ vowed to sacrifice the first creature that would emerge from his house; when his daughter was first to emerge, he assumed his vow remained in effect. This is viewed as an example of a foolish vow; see Judges 11:31–40 and <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 37:4.</i><br>Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: One who is weak above and one who is strong below, who prevails? It is the upper one. This is true all the more so when the upper one is He who lives eternally, who is strong above and you are below.

<b>“For the dream comes with much concern; and a fool's voice with many words” (Ecclesiastes 5:2).</b><br>“For the dream comes with much concern” – all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon the generation of the Flood were due to the many evil concerns in which they engaged. “And a fool’s voice with many words” – due to the many words that they expressed from their mouths, and said: “What is the Almighty that we should serve Him…” (Job 21:15).<br>Another matter: “For the dream comes with much concern” – all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon the generation of the Dispersion were due to the many evil concerns in which they engaged. “And a fool’s voice with many words” – as they said: “And we will make a name for ourselves…” (Genesis 11:4).<br>Another matter: “For the dream comes with much concern” – all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon the Sodomites were due to the many evil concerns in which they engaged. “And a fool’s voice with many words” – as they said: Let the convention of passersby be forgotten from among us;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Let us not allow the welcoming of guests or the performance of kindness to passersby.</i> that is what is written: “And it forgets that a foot may crush it or a beast of the field trample it” (Job 39:15).<br>Another matter: “For the dream comes with much concern” – all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon the Egyptians were due to the many evil concerns in which they engaged. “And a fool’s voice with many words” – as they said: “Who is the Lord that I should heed His voice…” (Exodus 5:2).<br>Another matter: “For the dream comes with much concern” – all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon Sisera were due to the many evil concerns in which he engaged. “And a fool's voice with many words” – as it is stated: “He oppressed the children of Israel…” (Judges 4:3).<br>Another matter: “For the dream comes with much concern,” all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon Sennacherib were due to the many evil concerns in which he engaged. “And a fool's voice with many words” – because he cursed and blasphemed, as it is stated: “Who among the gods of all these lands rescued their land [from my hand, that the Lord will rescue Jerusalem from my hand?”] (Isaiah 36:20).<br>Another matter: “For the dream comes with much concern” – all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were due to the many evil concerns in which they engaged, as it is stated: “They denied the Lord” (Jeremiah 5:12).<br>Another matter: “For the dream comes with much concern” – all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon Nebuchadnezzar were due to the many evil concerns in which he engaged, as it is stated: “Who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?” (Daniel 3:15).<br>Another matter “For the dream comes with much concern” – all the pain and suffering that the Holy One blessed be He brought upon Belshatzar were due to the many evil concerns in which he engaged, as it is written: “They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver…” (Daniel 5:4).<br>Likewise, you find regarding Pharaoh,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">You find a dream that comes with much concern.</i> as it is stated: “It was at the end of two full years [that Pharaoh dreamed]” (Genesis 41:1).

<b>“It is better that you do not vow, than that you vow and do not pay” (Ecclesiastes 5:4).</b><br>“It is better that you do not vow” – Rabbi Meir said: Better than both is one who does not vow at all, but rather brings his sheep to the Temple Courtyard, consecrates it, and slaughters it, as it is stated: “If you refrain from vowing, [there will be no sin in you]” (Deuteronomy 23:23).<br>Rabbi Huna said: There was an incident involving one who vowed and did not pay. He set sail in the Mediterranean Sea, and his ship sank in the sea and he died. Rabbi Shmuel said: Anyone who vows and does not pay causes for himself that his wife will die, as it is written: “I, when I came from Padan, Rachel died on me…” (Genesis 48:7).<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: Anyone who vows and does not pay causes [himself] to come to four transgressions: Idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, bloodshed, and slander, and all of them are derived from Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">While fleeing Esau, Jacob took a vow that he was to fulfill upon his return to Canaan (see Genesis 28:20–22), but he did not fulfill it immediately upon his return.</i> Idol worship, as it is written: “Remove the foreign gods” (Genesis 35:2). Forbidden sexual relations, as it is written: “That he had defiled Dina his daughter” (Genesis 34:5). Bloodshed, as it is written: “Jacob’s two sons, […each] took [his sword…and killed all the males]” (Genesis 34:25). And slander, as it is written: “He heard the words of Laban’s sons [saying: Jacob has taken everything that was our father’s]” (Genesis 31:1).<br>Rabbi Mana said: Anyone who vows and does not pay causes death to come upon him, as it is stated: “For the Lord your God will demand it of you [and it will be a sin for you]” (Deuteronomy 23:22), and Rabbi Ami said: There is no death without sin, and there is no suffering without iniquity. There is no death without sin, as it is stated: “The soul that sins, it will die” (Ezekiel 18:4).

<b>“Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was unwitting; why should God grow angry at your voice, and destroy your handiwork?” (Ecclesiastes 5:5)</b><br>“Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi interpreted the verse regarding those who pledge charity in public, but do not give it. “And do not say before the messenger” – this is the pledge collector; “that it was unwitting” – and I have reconsidered. “Why should God grow angry at your voice” – at that voice with which you uttered [your pledge]. “And destroy your handiwork” – the few mitzvot that this man has, the Holy One blessed be He introduces a curse in them and eradicates them from him.<br>Rabbi Binyamin interpreted the verse regarding those who engage in Torah disingenuously: “Do not allow your mouth” – do not give your mouth permission; “to cause your flesh to sin” – to cause your body to sin in your study.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This means: Do not speak in such a way that you cause yourself to sin, as the midrash will continue to explain.

Chapter 6

<b>“So it is with a multitude of dreams and vanities and many words; rather, fear God” (Ecclesiastes 5:6).</b><br>“So it is with a multitude of dreams and vanities and many words; rather, fear God” – Rabbi said: If you saw harsh dreams or harsh and unnatural visions, or if you fear them, jump to three matters and you will be saved from them, as Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: There are three matters that abrogate evil decrees, and they are: Prayer, charity, and repentance. All three are in one verse; this is what is written: “My people, upon whom My name is called, will submit, and pray, and seek My countenance, and repent their evil ways; I will hear from the heavens, and forgive their sin and heal their land” (II Chronicles 7:14). “And pray” – this is prayer; “and seek my countenance” – this is charity, as you say: “I will behold your countenance in righteousness” (Psalms 17:15);<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The same Hebrew root, <i>tzedek</i>, or <i>tzedaka</i>, can be translated as either charity or righteousness.</i> “and repent their evil ways” – this is repentance. Then, “I will hear from the heavens…” Rabbi Mona said: Fasting as well, as it is stated: “The Lord will answer you on your day of trouble” (Psalms 20:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">From the fact that the verse says, “day,” and not time of trouble, the midrash understands that the reference is to a day of fasting.</i><br>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Yosei say: A change of name and a change of action, as well. Some say even a change of place, as it is written: “Go for yourself from your land” (Genesis 12:1). A change of name [is derived] from Abraham our patriarch, as it is stated: “Your name will no longer be called Abram, but your name will be Abraham” (Genesis 17:5). Abram cannot beget, Abraham can beget; Sarai cannot bear a child, Sarah can bear a child.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">God changed Abram’s name to Abraham and Sarai’s name to Sarah when they were ninety-nine and eighty-nine years old respectively and bereft of children. In the same context, He promised them that they would have many descendants (see Genesis 17:1–16). The implication is that although Abram and Sarai could not have children, their name changes would enable them to do so.</i> A change in action, from Nineveh, as it is stated: “God saw their actions, [that they turned from their evil way; and God reconsidered the harm that He had said He would do to them, and He did not do it]” (Jonah 3:10).<br>Rabba bar Meḥseya and Ḥama bar Gurya say: A fast is effective for a dream like fire for tow. Rav Ḥisda said: On that day. Rav Yosef said: Even on Shabbat. Likewise, you find regarding Hezekiah king of Judah; when Hezekiah fell ill, the Holy One blessed be He said to Isaiah: ‘Go say to him: “Set your house in order, as you will die and will not live”’ (Isaiah 38:1). Hezekiah said to Isaiah: ‘Isaiah, the way of the world is that a person who goes to visit the ill says to him: May they have mercy upon you from Heaven, and the doctor goes to him and says: Eat this item and do not eat that item; drink this and do not drink that. Even if he sees him approaching death, he would not say to him: Set your house in order, so he will not be discouraged; yet you say to me: “Set your house in order, as you will die and will not live”? I, too, do not ascribe importance to you and I will not heed your words, and I adopt only what my ancestor<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Solomon</i> said: “So it is with a multitude of dreams and vanities and many words…”’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Even prophetic dreams can be nullified and thereby rendered vanity, if one fulfills the conclusion of the verse, which states to “fear God.” This can be expressed via prayer, fasting, and repentance (Maharzu).</i><br>Immediately, “Hezekiah turned his face to the wall [<i>hakir</i>] [and prayed to the Lord]” (Isaiah 38:2). To which wall did he direct his face? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: He directed his face to the wall of Raḥav, as it is written: “Because her house was upon the side of [<i>bekir</i>] the wall” (Joshua 2:15). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, Raḥav rescued two souls for You and how many souls did You rescue for her?’ It was taught that Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Even if her family numbered two hundred people and they cleaved to two hundred [additional] families [through marriage], they were all rescued by her merit. It is not written here, “all her family,” but rather, “they took out all her families” (Joshua 6:23). ‘My ancestors who assembled all the converts to You,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">See II Chronicles 2:16.</i> all the more so.’<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">By their merit, You should rescue me.</i><br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It was to the wall of the Shunamite woman that he directed his eyes, as it is written: “Let us make a [small] walled attic” (II Kings 4:10).

How can I go and say so?’ [God] said to [Isaiah]: ‘He is humble and will accept it from you. Moreover, what you spoke has not yet become public, as it is written: “It was, Isaiah had not departed…”’ (II Kings 20:4). When Isaiah went to him, [Hezekiah] said to him: ‘Did I not say this to you initially: I do not ascribe importance to you and I will not heed your words; [I adopt] only what my ancestor said: “So it is with a multitude of dreams and vanities…”’

<b>“If you see exploitation of the poor, and the perversion of justice and integrity in the state, do not marvel at the purpose; for one higher than high is watching, and there are high ones over them” (Ecclesiastes 5:7).</b><br>“If you see exploitation of the poor” – if you see one exploiting the poor and the indigent, and the Righteous One, who lives forever, bestows tranquility and good upon him, “see…in the state [<i>bamedina</i>],” see in him the sentence<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bamedina</i> is expounded as a portmanteau of <i>bam dina</i>, they will be sentenced.</i> of Gehenna. “For one higher” – these are the angels; “and there are high ones over them” – this is the Holy One blessed be He.<br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina interpreted the verse regarding Esau. If you saw Esau in the great city of Rome<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages considered the Romans to be descendants of Esau.</i> exploiting the poor and robbing the indigent, and the Holy One blessed be He bestows tranquility upon him, you will [yet] see in him the attribute of justice.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Rome will eventually be punished.</i> “Do not marvel” regarding what the old man<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Isaac</i> said and his wish was fulfilled, as it is stated: “Behold, of the fat of the earth will be your dwelling” (Genesis 27:39). “For one higher” – these are the ministers, governors, and commanders. “And there are high ones over them” – this is the King who lives forever. Rabbi Aḥa said: From the “behold” of flesh and blood you learn of the “behold” of the Holy One blessed be He. Just as the “behold” of flesh and blood provided life for an entire people in this world, as it is stated: “Behold, I have given Haman’s house to Esther” (Esther 8:7), when the “behold” of the Holy One blessed be He comes, as it is stated: “Behold, a day of the Lord is coming, [and your spoil shall be divided in your midst]” (Zechariah 14:1), all the more so.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">If the “behold” of Aḥashverosh granted the Jews great wealth from Haman, who was a descendant of Esau, all the more so that the Jews will benefit when God upholds His prophecy beginning with “behold.”</i>

Chapter 8

<b>“The advantage of land is in every way, a king is subservient to a field. One who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, nor one who loves abundance with produce; this too is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 5:8–9).</b><br>“The advantage of land is in every way” – Rabbi Yehuda says: Even matters that you consider superfluous in the world are [an important] part of the existence of the world, like fiber to make rope, a thorn bush to fence a garden; they are [an important] part of the existence of the world.<br>“A king is subservient to a field” – even a king who reigns from one end of the world to the other end, “he is subservient to a field” – he asks and says: Has the field produced? Has the field not produced? Therefore, “one who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver, nor one who loves abundance with produce,” as anyone who avidly pursues riches, but does not have land, what benefit does he have?<br>Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Ḥanin say: It is written: “Everyone who grasps an oar will disembark from their ships; sailors and all navigators of the sea will stand upon the land” (Ezekiel 27:29). Do we not know that it is land on which they stand? Rather, if the ship of one of them sinks and he has land ashore, it supports him.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">If one’s livelihood is only from trade, he can easily lose everything if his ship goes down at sea. If he owns land, he can plant crops and be sustained in a less risky manner.</i> If he has no land, there is no greater vanity.
Rabbi Neḥemya says: “The advantage of land is in every way.” Matters that appear as though they are beyond the scope of the Torah, like the addenda<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to tannaitic literature not included in the Mishna.</i> of the study hall of Rabbi and the addenda of the study hall of Rabbi Natan, the laws of converts and slaves, they too were given to Moses from Sinai. And like the laws of ritual fringes, phylacteries, and <i>mezuzot</i>, they are included in the Torah, as it is written: “The Lord gave me the two tablets of stone inscribed with the finger of God, and on them were all the matters [<i>kekhol hadevarim</i>]” (Deuteronomy 9:10), and it is written: “All the mitzva [<i>hamitzva</i>] that I am commanding you…” (Deuteronomy 8:1), <i>Kol</i>,<i> kekhol</i>; <i>devarim</i>,<i> hadevarim</i>; mitzva, <i>hamitzva</i><sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">These words contain superfluous prefixes, as the verses could have said <i>kol</i>, <i>devarim</i>, and mitzva, but instead says <i>kekhol</i>, <i>hadevarim</i>, and <i>hamitzva</i>. All these prefixes are amplifications that serve to include the types of Torah study detailed in the midrash.</i> – [to teach that] Bible, Mishna, <i>halakha</i>, Talmud, addenda, <i>aggadot</i>, and even what a distinguished disciple is destined to say before his teacher, all these were given as a <i>halakha</i> to Moses from Sinai. “King” – this is a master of Talmud; “Subservient to a field” – this is the master of the Mishna, who hoes the <i>halakha</i> before him.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Just as one hoes in order to eventually reap the crops, one who masters the Mishna is then able to analyze the <i>mishnayot</i> and apply them as necessary.</i> Rabbi Yaakov bar Avuna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: One who learned but did not teach, there is no greater vanity than this.<br>The Rabbis say: Even things in the world that you consider to be superfluous, like flies, fleas, and gnats, they too are included in the creation of the world, as it is stated: “[The heavens and the earth] were completed, [with all their host]” (Genesis 2:1).
“King” – this is the Holy One blessed be He; “is subservient [<i>ne’evad</i>] to a field” – this is Zion, as it is stated: “Zion will be plowed like a field” (Micah 3:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets this to mean that God, the King, is worshipped [<i>ne’evad</i>] in the Temple, in Zion.</i> Therefore, “one who loves silver,” who loves mitzvot, “will not be satisfied” with the mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">He will want more mitzvot.</i> And if one does not have a mitzva that is fixed for the generations,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">That will have a long-term effect.</i> what benefit does he have?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">After his death.</i> As Moses, how many mitzvot and acts of righteousness did he perform, and he has a mitzva fixed for the generations, as it is written: “Then Moses designated three cities” (Deuteronomy 4:41).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Although Moses had done many mitzvot during his lifetime, and the three cities he designated as cities of refuge would not function in that capacity until the Israelites settled the Land of Israel, he nonetheless made sure to designate them before he died so as to fulfill a mitzva with a lasting effect.</i>
Another matter: “The advantage of land [is in every way]…” – the Holy One blessed be He said to the prophets: What do you believe, that if you do not go on My mission that I have no emissary? That is, “the advantage of land is in every way”; I can accomplish My mission with anything. Rabbi Aḥa said: Even by means of a snake, by means of a scorpion, by means of a gnat, and even by means of a frog.<br>The wicked Titus entered the Holy of Holies with a drawn sword in his hand and he cut the curtain. He seized two prostitutes in his hand and engaged in relations with them atop the altar. He emerged with his sword full of blood. Some say that it was blood of sacrifices and some say it was the blood of the Yom Kippur goat.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to offerings whose blood is sprinkled on the curtain dividing between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.</i> He began cursing and blaspheming and saying: There is no comparison between one who wages war with a king in the wilderness and defeats him and one who wages war with a king in his house and defeats him. What did he do? He gathered all the Temple vessels into a net and boarded a ship. When he set sail, a large wave struck him in the sea. He said: It appears that the God of this nation has power only in the water. He exacted retribution against the generation of Enosh only with water,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 90:6.</i> and I, too, when I was in His house, He was unable to stand against me; now, He has confronted me here. The Holy One blessed be He said: Oh, wicked one son of a wicked one, by your life, with the smallest creature I created during the six days of Creation, I will exact retribution from this wicked one.<br>Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He scolded the sea and it calmed from its raging. [Titus] emerged from there. When he reached Rome, all the residents of Rome emerged and lauded him: Capturer of the barbarians. Immediately, they heated the bathhouse for him and he bathed. When he emerged, they blended him a goblet of a post-bath elixir of wine. The Holy One blessed be He arranged a gnat for him in the cup; it entered into his nostril and began gnawing at his brain. It continued eating until it grew and was like the fledgling of a dove weighing two <i>litra</i>. [Titus] said: ‘Call doctors for him and they will split the brain of this man<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Titus referred to himself in the third person.</i> to ascertain with what the God of this nation exacted retribution from him.’ They called the doctors, they split his brain, and found [a creature] like the fledgling of a dove weighing two <i>litra</i>. Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Yosei said: I was there in Rome, and they placed that [gnat that was the size of a] dove on one side of the scale and two <i>litra</i> on one side, and they balanced each other.

Rabbi Tanḥuma and Rabbi Menaḥama were relating these incidents. There was an incident involving a certain man who was standing near a river. He saw a frog laden with a scorpion and taking it across the river. He said: This one is certainly prepared to fulfill its mission. It took it across, and it fulfilled its mission.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">It bit a person.</i> And it took it back to its place.

A certain man<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, he was a snake charmer.</i> came and stood and examined the snake. He said: ‘I wonder, who was it who killed the snake?’ That man said: ‘I killed it.’ He saw the shrub on his head [and] said to him: ‘Can you remove that wreath from your head?’<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The second man understood that the first man was protected from the snake’s venom only due to the wreath he was wearing on his head.</i> He said: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘Can you come here [and touch] this snake with this staff?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ When he approached that snake, immediately his limbs fell off.<br>Rabbi Yannai was sitting and teaching at the entrance to the city and saw a certain snake that was agitated and was approaching.

Immediately the sound of a cry befell the city: So-and-so was bitten by a snake and died.<br>Rabbi Elazar was sitting in the bathroom; a certain Roman came and made him stand up and [the Roman] sat down [in his stead]. [Rabbi Elazar] said: This did not happen gratuitously. Immediately, a snake came and bit [the Roman], and he died.

He saw a femur bone rolling and coming. He buried it, but it rolled [out]; he buried it, and it rolled [out again]. He said: This is prepared to fulfill its mission. Several days later, a messenger from the kingdom passed and it rolled between his feet and he stumbled, fell, and died. They went and checked in his bag, and found that it was filled with evil edicts against the Jews of Caesarea.<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta was a researcher. He had an orchard in which there was a tree stump. A hoopoe went and made a nest on it. Rabbi Shimon rose and dismantled it. What did he do? He brought a board and a nail to the entrance [to the nest] and affixed it. What did the hoopoe do? It went and brought a shrub, placed it on that nail and destroyed it. What did Rabbi Shimon do? He said: It would be best for me to conceal that [shrub] so thieves will not go and do as it did and bring destruction upon the people. Rabbi Yannai’s female donkey ate the shrub and was blinded. It ate a different shrub and recovered its sight.<br>There was an incident involving two men who were coming on the paths of Tiberias, one blind and one sighted, with the sighted leading the blind. They sat to rest on the way, and it happened that they ate of the shrub. The one who was blind recovered his sight, and the one who was sighted went blind. They did not move from there until the one who had been blind led the one who had been sighted.<br>There was an incident involving a man who ascended from Babylon.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">He was travelling from Babylon to the Land of Israel.</i> He sat to rest on the way and saw two birds fighting with each other, and one killed its counterpart. The other went and brought a shrub and placed it on the dead one and revived it. He said: It would be good for me to take this shrub and revive with it the dead in the Land of Israel. He ran and ascended; he saw a fox that was dead and cast on the way. He said: It would be good for me to test it on this fox. He placed it on it and revived it. He was walking until he reached the Ladder of Tyre. When he reached the Ladder of Tyre, he saw a lion that had been killed and cast on the way. He said: Let me test it on this one. He placed it on it and revived it. It rose against him and ate him. This is what people say: Do not perform good for the evil, and evil will not befall you. If you perform good for the evil, you have performed evil.<br>Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Even with water, the Holy One blessed be He accomplishes His mission. There was an incident involving one who was afflicted with boils who descended to immerse in the sea of Tiberias, and it happened that at that moment the spring of Miriam<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This was a spring of water that traveled with the Israelites in the wilderness and provided water for them.</i> rose and he bathed and was cured.<br>Where is the spring of Miriam? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: It is written: “And overlooks the surface of the wasteland [<i>hayeshimon</i>]” (Numbers 21:20), as anyone who climbs Mount Yeshimon sees a small sieve-like item in the sea of Tiberias, and this is the spring of Miriam. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Rabbis calculated it, and it is aligned opposite the middle gate of the ancient synagogue of Serongeya.<br>Rabbi Huna bar Pappa said: The children of Israel sacrificed offerings on prohibited makeshift altars in the wilderness [the way they did] before the Tabernacle was established. We learned: Before the Tabernacle was established, makeshift altars were permitted and the sacrificial service was by the firstborn. Once the Tabernacle was established, the makeshift altars were prohibited and the sacrificial service was by the priests. The Israelites would violate the prohibition of makeshift altars in the wilderness, and punishments would eliminate them. The nations of the world would say: They worship in His name and He kills them in the wilderness. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Any man of the house of Israel who slaughters a bull or sheep.… and to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting [does not bring it]…[that man shall be cut off from among his people]” (Leviticus 17:3–4).<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">In order to prevent them from slaughtering consecrated animals outside the Tabernacle, God commanded them to refrain from slaughtering even non-sacred animals.</i>

<b>“With the increase of good, those who consume it increase; what use is there for its owner, other than the sight of his eyes?” (Ecclesiastes 5:10).</b><br>“With the increase of good, those who consume it increase” – Rabbi Ḥananya and Rabbi Yonatan asked Menaḥem the confectioner, and Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥananya: Menaḥem the confectioner asked them:<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is presenting two traditions as to whether they asked Menaḥem or he asked them.</i> ‘What is that [which is stated]: “He afflicted you and starved you” (Deuteronomy 8:3)?

Why, then, is its price double?</i> He said: ‘They are not comparable, for just as one enjoys the taste, so too he enjoys the appearance.’<br>Rabbi Elazar [said] in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Zimra: Three matters were stated regarding the fig tree: It is good for eating, attractive to the eyes, and adds wisdom, and the three of them appear in a single verse. “The woman saw that the tree was good for eating” (Genesis 3:6) – from here that it was good for eating; “and that it was an enticement to the eyes” (Genesis 3:6) – from here that it is attractive to the eyes; “and that it was desirable for wisdom [<i>lehaskil</i>]” (Genesis 3:6) – from here that it adds wisdom. That is what is written: “A contemplation [<i>maskil</i>] of Eitan HaEzraḥi” (Psalms 89:1).<br>Likewise, Isaac says: “Prepare tasty food for me” (Genesis 27:4). He said to him: ‘Initially, I enjoyed the appearance; now I enjoy only the taste.’<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This is because Isaac’s eyes had grown dim; see Genesis 27:1.</i> Likewise, Solomon says: “With the increase of good, those who consume it increase” – there is no comparison between one who sees his food basket empty and is hungry, and one who sees his food basket full and is satiated.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning is that seeing one’s food basket empty makes one feel hungry and seeing one’s food basket full makes one feel satiated.</i><br>A certain Samaritan asked Rabbi Meir, he said to him: ‘Will the dead [yet] live?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘Yes’. He said to him: ‘In private or publicly?’ He said to him: ‘Publicly.’ He said to him: ‘From where can you show me [that it is so]?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘It is not from the Bible, and not from the Mishna, but rather, from the way of the world that I respond to you.’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘There is a trustworthy person in our city, and everyone deposits with him in private and he returns it to them publicly.

If beans, when you sow them unclothed, they arise clothed, the dead person who goes [to the grave] clothed [in shrouds], is it not all the more so that he will come [back to life] with a garment?’<br>Rabbi Aivu [said], and some teach it in the name of Rabbi Natan: It is written: “It will be transformed like clay under the seal; and they stand like a garment” (Job 38:14).

It is taught: When a fetus is formed in its mother’s womb, there are three partners in it, the Holy One blessed be He, its father, and its mother. Its father injects the white substance, from which come the white [substances of the body], and the brain, the nails, the white of the eye, the bones, and the tendons. Its mother injects the red substances, from which come the blood, the skin, the flesh, the hair, and black of the eye. The Holy One blessed be He, may His name be blessed and His memory exalted, places ten matters in it, and these are: Spirit, soul, countenance, eyesight, hearing of the ears, speech of the lips, lifting of the arms and walking of the legs, wisdom and understanding, counsel and knowledge, and strength. When the time of his passing arrives, the Holy One blessed be He takes His portion and leaves the portion of his father and his mother before them, and his father and his mother cry. The Holy One blessed be He says to them: ‘Why are you crying? Did I take anything of yours? I took only what was Mine.’ They say before Him: ‘Master of the universe, as long as Your portion was intermingled with our portions, our portions were protected from maggots and worms. Now that You have taken your portion from the midst of our portions, our portions are cast aside and subject to maggots and worms.’<br>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would analogize it; to what is the matter analogous? It is to a king who had a vineyard and entrusted it to a sharecropper. The king said to his servants: ‘Go and harvest my vineyard, take my portion, and leave the portion of the sharecropper in its place.’ Immediately, they went and acted in accordance with the king’s command. The sharecropper began screaming and weeping. The king said to him: ‘Did I take anything of yours? Did I not take only what was mine?’ He said to him: ‘My lord, the king, as long as your portion was with my portion, my portion was protected from plunder and theft. Now that you have taken your portion, my portion is cast aside for plunder and theft.’ The king [in the analogy] is the King, king of kings, the Holy One blessed be He. The sharecropper, this is a person’s father and mother. As long as the soul is in the person, he is protected. When he dies he is given to maggots and worms, as it is stated: “How much less so man, a maggot” (Job 25:6) – these are the lice [that afflict him] during his lifetime; “the son of man, a worm” (Job 25:6) – these are the worms that creep under him after his death.<br>Shimon ben Elazar says: Even a living one-day-old does not require protection from a weasel, nor from mice, nor from snakes. The dog sees [him] and flees. The snake sees [him] and flees. But when dead, even one [mighty] as Og king of Bashan requires protection from a weasel and from mice and snakes. As long as a person is alive, his fear is cast on all creatures, beasts, and creeping creatures, as it is stated: “And your fear and your dread shall be upon every beast of the earth…” (Genesis 9:2). When a person dies, the fear of him is removed, and he requires protection.<br>A living one-day-old baby, one may desecrate Shabbat on his behalf; [but even for] David king of Israel, [when he is] dead, one does not desecrate Shabbat on his behalf. This is as Solomon said: “For a living dog is better than a dead lion” (Ecclesiastes 9:4), and like what Rav Yehuda said that Rav said, as Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: What is it that is written: “Lord, inform me of my end, and the measure of my days, what it is” (Psalms 39:5)? David said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, inform me of my end.’ [God] said to him: ‘It is decreed before Me that one does not reveal the end of flesh and blood.’ [David said: ‘Let me know] “the measure of my days, what it is.”’ He said to him: ‘It is a decree of Mine not to reveal the measure of a person’s days.’ He said to Him: “Let me know how short-lived I am” (Psalms 39:5). He said to him: ‘You will die on a Shabbat.’ He said to Him: ‘Let me die on a Sunday.’ He said to him: ‘The [time for the] kingship of your son Solomon will have already arrived, and one kingdom does not overlap with another even one hairbreadth.’ He said to Him: ‘Let me die on the day before Shabbat.’ He said to him: ‘“For a day in your courts is better than a thousand” (Psalms 84:11) – a single day in which you sit and engage in Torah is preferable to Me than the thousand burnt offerings that your son Solomon will offer before Me on the altar.’<br>Each Shabbat he would sit and study all day. He had a garden behind his house, and when that day [arrived],<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">The day David was meant to die.</i> the Angel of Death came and shook the trees. [David] went out to see [what the source of the noise was]. As he was climbing the stairs, a stair broke beneath him, he was silent, and died. Solomon sent [word] to the study hall: Father died and is lying in the sun, and the dogs of father’s house are hungry. What should I do? They sent to him: Cut up a carcass and place it before the dogs. And your father, place a loaf or an infant on top of him, and move him [out of the sun].<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">A corpse may not be moved on Shabbat due to the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>; however, if a loaf or an infant is placed on the corpse, it may be moved due to the presence of the non-<i>muktze</i> item.</i> Did Solomon not say appropriately: “For a living dog is better than a dead lion” (Ecclesiastes 9:4)?

Rabbi turned around and looked at him and said: ‘Solomon spoke correctly: “Sweet is the sleep of the laborer, whether he eats a little or a lot; but the satiety of the wealthy does not allow him to sleep”; [this is referring to people] like me, as we are attending to the needs of the people, and we are not free even to sleep.’<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: To what is this matter analogous? It is to a king who had an orchard and he transferred it to his son. As long as his son did his bidding, the king would see what a beautiful tree there is in the world and would plant it in his son’s orchard. But whenever his son did not do his bidding, he would see what a beautiful, outstanding tree there was in the orchard, and he would uproot it. So, the king is the Holy One blessed be He, the orchard is the world, and some say it is the Israelites. As long as they do the bidding of the Holy One blessed be He, when He sees a righteous person in the nations of the world, like Yitro, Raḥav, and Ruth, and like Antoninus, He brings him and has him cleave to Israel. Whenever they do not do His bidding, He sees what righteous person there is in Israel and He takes him from them.
What is the difference between the death of lads and the death of elders? Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: Rabbi Yehuda says: This lamp, when it is extinguished on its own, it is good for it and good for the wick; when it is extinguished not on its own, it is bad for it and bad for the wick.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, when one dies young, it is bad for him and bad for those he leaves behind.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya says: This fig tree, as long as it is harvested at its time, it is good for it<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The harvested fruit</i> and good for the fig tree; when it is not harvested at its time, it is bad for it and bad for the fig tree.<br>There was an incident involving Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and his students, and some say, Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta and his students, and some say, Rabbi Akiva and his students. They were sitting and studying under a particular fig tree. The owner of the fig tree would rise early and harvest his fig tree. They said: Let us relocate, as perhaps he suspects us [of eating his figs]. They sat elsewhere. The next day, the owner of the fig tree rose early to harvest his fig tree, but he did not find them. He searched for them and found them. He said to them: ‘My rabbis, there was one mitzva that you would perform with me, and you have withheld it from me.’<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">He considered it a privilege that his tree provided shade for the rabbis while they studied Torah.</i> They said to him: ‘God forbid.’ He said to them: ‘Why did you abandon your place and sit elsewhere?’ They said to him: ‘We said: Perhaps he will suspect us.’ He said to them: ‘God forbid. Rather, I will tell you why I would rise early and harvest them; because when the sun shines upon it they become worm infested.’ One day, he left them and did not harvest, and they found that the sun was shining on them and they had become worm infested. They said: ‘The owner of a fig tree knows well the time when it is appropriate to harvest his fig tree, and he harvests it. So too, the Holy One blessed be He knows when the time of the righteous person has arrived, and He takes him.’
Ḥiyya bar Rav Ada, son of bar Kappara’s sister, died. They said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: ‘Go up and eulogize him.’ He said to them: ‘Let Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish go up, as he knows his strengths.’ Rabbi Shimon got up and eulogized: ‘“My beloved has gone down to his garden” (Song of Songs 6:2); the Holy One blessed be He knows the actions of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav Ada and has taken him.’
When Rabbi Simon bar Zevid died, Rabbi Eila got up and eulogized him with these verses: “But wisdom, where shall it be found.… Man does not know its value” (Job 28:12–13). “It is hidden from the eyes of all living” (Job 28:21). “The depths say: It is not in me” (Job 28:14). If so, a Torah scholar who died, how can we find his replacement? There are four items that are commonly used in the world, and all of them, if they are eliminated, they have replacements. They are: “For there is a source for silver, and a place for gold that they refine; iron is taken from the dust, and bronze is molten from stone” (Job 28:1–2). But, a Torah scholar who died, who will bring us his replacement? We lost Rabbi Simon; who will bring us his replacement? Rabbi Levi said: The tribes found a lost item<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">The sons of Jacob found that the money they had paid to purchase produce in Egypt had been returned to their sacks.</i> and wondered, and their hearts sank, as it is stated: “Their hearts sank and they trembled” (Genesis 42:28). We, who lost Rabbi Simon bar Zevid, all the more so.
When Rabbi Bon ben Rabbi Ḥiyya died, Rabbi Zeira got up and eulogized him with this verse: “Sweet is the sleep of the laborer.” To what was Rabbi Bon ben Rabbi Ḥiyya comparable? To a king who had a vineyard and hired many laborers to work it. There was one worker who performed his labor much more efficiently than all the rest. What did the king do? He took him by his hand and went with him on long and short strolls. At evening time, the laborers came to collect their wages, and that laborer came with them, and he gave him his wages in full. The laborers began protesting; they said: ‘We toiled all day, and this one toiled for two hours, and the king gave him his wages in full?’ The king said to them: ‘Why are you protesting? This one toiled for two hours efficiently [and accomplished] what you did not [accomplish] in your toil over the whole day.’ So too, Rabbi Bon ben Rabbi Ḥiyya learned [more] Torah in twenty-eight years than a distinguished disciple can learn in one hundred years.<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who toils in Torah study in this world, in the World to Come they do not leave him to sleep, but they lead him to the study hall of Shem and Ever and of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and Aaron. Until when? Until “I will make a great name for you, like the names of the great ones in the world” (II Samuel 7:9).

Chapter 12

<b>“There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: Wealth protected for its owner to his detriment” (Ecclesiastes 5:12).</b><br>“There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun”: “there is a grievous evil” – is there a grievous evil and a good evil? What, then, is a grievous evil? It is, for example, gout, poverty, debilitation, nakedness, and hunger.<br>“Wealth protected for its owner to his detriment” – Rabbi Yehoshua says: This is Koraḥ. Rabbi Shmuel said: This is Navot the Yizre’elite. Rabbi Yehuda said: This is Haman. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the Reubenites and the Gadites. The Rabbis say: This is Job, who was rich, became poor, and was restored to what he had been. Rabbi Gamliel ben Rabbi Ḥanina asked before Rabbi Mona, he said: ‘What is this that is written: “Wealth protected for its owner to his detriment”?’ He said to him: ‘The only benefit of the matter is regarding his punishment; when a punishment of the kingdom is imposed upon him, he will give what he will give.’<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">The only benefit of wealth is that if the government imposes a fine upon him he will be able to pay it.</i>

Chapter 13

<b>“That wealth is lost in a grievous manner; he begets a son, and he has nothing in his hand” (Ecclesiastes 5:13).</b><br>“That wealth is lost in a grievous manner” – Rabbi Ḥaggai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: [His wealth is lost] due to the grievous manner in which he thought about a certain pauper.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the owner of the wealth mentioned in verse 12.</i> He said to him: ‘Would it not be better for you to toil and eat? Look at your thighs, look at your feet, look at your girth; would it not be better for you to toil and eat?’ The Holy One blessed be He said: Is it not enough that you did not give him anything of what is yours, that you cast an evil eye on what I gave him? Therefore, “he begets a son, and he has nothing in his hand” – he will not leave, from the money in his possession, for his son.

Chapter 14

<b>“As he emerged from his mother's womb, so he will return naked, to go as he came, and he will take nothing for his toil that he can carry in his hand” (Ecclesiastes 5:14).</b><br>“As he emerged from his mother's womb” – Geniva said: [It is analogous] to a fox that found a vineyard that was fenced on all sides. There was one opening, and it sought to enter through it but was unable to do so. What did it do? It fasted three days until it was thin and weak, and it entered through the opening, ate, and grew fat. It sought to exit, but it could not pass at all. It again fasted, three other days, until it was thin and weak and it returned to be as it had been, and it exited. When it exited, it turned its face and looked at [the vineyard]. It said: ‘Vineyard, vineyard, what good are you, and what good are the fruits that are in you? Everything that is in you is good and excellent; however, what benefit is there from you? Just as one enters into you, so he emerges.’ This world is the same.<br>Another matter: “As he emerged from his mother's womb, so he will return naked, to go as he came” – it is taught: As a person comes, so he will go. A person comes with noise, and takes his leave of the world with noise; he comes to the world with weeping, and takes his leave of this world with weeping; he comes to the world with affection, and takes his leave of the world with affection; he comes to the world with a sigh, and takes his leave of the world with a sigh; he comes to the world without knowledge, and takes his leave of the world without knowledge.<br>It is taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: When a person comes to the world, his fists are clenched, as though to say: The entire world is mine, I will inherit it. When he takes his leave of the world his hands are open, as though to say: I did not inherit anything in this world, as Solomon said: “As he emerged from his mother's womb, so he will return naked, to go as he came, and [he will take] nothing [for his toil that he can carry in his hand].”

Chapter 15

<b>“This too is a grievous evil; just as he came, so he will go; and what is the advantage for him that he will toil for the wind?” (Ecclesiastes 5:15).</b><br>“This too is a grievous evil; just as he came, so he will go” – just as he came into the world eating soft foods, so he will go eating soft foods. Rabbi Pinḥas said: Just as He began the world with four kingdoms, He concluded with four kingdoms. He began with four kingdoms, as it is stated: “Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, Tidal, king of Goyim, Amrafel, king of Shinar, and Ariokh, king of Elasar” (Genesis 14:9), and concluded with four kingdoms: Babylon, Greece, Media, and Edom.<br>“And what is the advantage for him that he will toil for the wind?” – The Holy One blessed be He said to man: You plowed, sowed, reaped, gathered, threshed, and created a pile of grain. If I do not provide wind to winnow for you, how will you live? They give the <i>omer</i> as payment for that wind; that is, “What is the advantage for him that he will toil for the wind”?

Chapter 16

<b>“In addition, all his days, he eats in darkness, and has much anger, illness, and rage” (Ecclesiastes 5:16).</b><br>“In addition, all his days, he” walks “in darkness” – this refers to the generation of the Judges. “And has much anger” – they would anger the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “Illness and rage”: “illness” – this is suffering; “and rage” – that they enraged the Holy One blessed be He and said: “Why, Lord, God of Israel, has this been in Israel, to have one tribe lacking in Israel today?” (Judges 21:3).<br>Another matter: “In addition, all his days, he” walks “in darkness” – this refers to the generation of Samuel. “And has much anger” – they would anger the Holy One blessed be He with their wicked deeds. “Illness and rage”: “illness” – this is suffering; “and rage” – that they enraged [God] and said: “Why did the Lord cause us to be smitten?” (I Samuel 4:3). The ten tribes were exiled, and none remained of them. Judah and Benjamin were exiled, and some remained.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the ten tribes are another example of a group that walked in darkness and angered God.</i>

Chapter 17

<b>“Behold what I have seen to be good: That it is fine to eat, and to drink, and to see benefit in all one’s toil that he toils under the sun, the number of days of his life that God has granted him, as it is his portion” (Ecclesiastes 5:17).</b><br>“Behold what I have seen to be good: That it is fine to eat and to drink.” Rabbi Tanḥuma says: Every instance in which eating and drinking are stated in this scroll, the verse is referring to Torah and good deeds. Rabbi Yona said: The paradigm for all of them is as it is stated: “[There is nothing better…than to eat, drink, and rejoice]. That will accompany him in his toil [<i>baamalo</i>]” (Ecclesiastes 8:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel midrash (<i>Kohelet Rabba</i> 2:24) adds at this point of the derivation: “That will accompany him in his toil [<i>baamalo</i>]” (Ecclesiastes 8:15) – in his world [<i>beolamo</i>], in this world. “During the days of his life” (Ecclesiastes 8:15) – to the grave.”</i> Is there eating and drinking that accompanies a person to the grave? What accompanies him? It is Torah and good deeds.

Chapter 18

<b>“Also any man to whom God has given wealth and property, and granted him control to eat from it, and to bear his portion, and to rejoice in his toil, this is a gift of God” (Ecclesiastes 5:18).</b><br>“Also any man to whom God has given wealth and property, and granted him control to eat from it” – Rabbi Pinḥas said: This attribute is not in effect for all people, but rather for one whom the Holy One blessed be He desires.

Chapter 19

<b>“For let him remember the days of his life that they are not many, as it is God who responds with the joy of his heart” (Ecclesiastes 5:19).</b><br>“For let him remember the days of his life that they are not many” – this is the generation of Eli.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the prophecy that Eli’s descendants would not have long lives, due to the behavior of Eli and the sins of his sons.

Chapter 1

<b>“There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it is prevalent among men” (Ecclesiastes 6:1).</b><br>“There is an evil that I have seen under the sun.” Rabbi Shmuel bar Ami said: This is the thought of swindlers, like one who mixes water into wine, poppy oil into [olive] oil, spring water into honey, donkey milk into balsam oil, sap into myrrh, grape leaves into valuable pollen, water dyed red into fish brine, vetch into pepper, [or one who uses] a scale beam that is long on one side and short on the other side. Regarding all these, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Woe is me if I say it, and woe is me if I do not say it. If I say it, perhaps the swindlers will learn [new techniques for swindling]. If I do not say it, the swindlers will say: The Torah scholars are not conversant in our handiwork.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">And therefore they will engage in swindling all the more.</i> Ultimately, he said it, “for the ways of the Lord are straight, the righteous walk in them [and the transgressors stumble in them]” (Hosea 14:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This teaches that truth must be stated, even if it will cause sinners to commit more transgressions.</i>

Chapter 2

<b>“A man to whom God gives wealth, assets, and honor, and he lacks nothing for his soul of everything that he desires, but God does not give him power to partake of it; rather a stranger partakes of it. This is vanity, and it is a grave disease” (Ecclesiastes 6:2).</b><br>“A man to whom God gives” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana entered a synagogue and he heard the voice of Rabbi Levi sitting and expounding this verse: “A man to whom God gives wealth” – this is one well-versed in Bible; “assets” – this is one well-versed in Mishna; “and honor” – this is one well-versed in <i>Tosefta</i>; “and he lacks nothing for his soul of everything that he desires” – like the mishna of Rabbi Akiva, the mishna of Rabbi Ḥiyya, of Rabbi Hoshaya, and of bar Kappara;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Each of these sages had extensive collections of organized teachings referred to here as “mishna.”</i> “but God does not give him power to partake of it” – as it is prohibited to issue halakhic rulings on their basis; “rather a stranger partakes of it” – this is one well-versed in Talmud, who impurifies and purifies, prohibits and permits. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana rose and kissed him on his head. He said to him: ‘Had I entered only to hear this homily from you, it would have sufficed.’ Rabbi Yishmael says: “The wealthy is wise in his eyes” (Proverbs 28:11), this is one well-versed in Talmud; “and the impoverished one who understands will examine him” (Proverbs 28:11), this is one well-versed in <i>aggada</i>.

Chapter 3

<b>“If a man begets one hundred, and lives many years, and the days of his years are many, but his soul is not sated from the good, and he did not have a burial; I say, a stillborn is better than he” (Ecclesiastes 6:3).</b><br>“If a man begets one hundred” – this is Cain who begot one hundred sons; “and lives many years” – as [Cain] lived many years; “and the days of his years are many [but his soul is not sated from the good]” – his soul was not sated by his possessions and was not sated from the good of the world; “and he did not have a burial” – he was in abeyance, weakening, and the flood came and washed him away, as it is written: “He obliterated all the <i>yekum</i>” (Genesis 7:23). What is the <i>yekum</i>? It is existence [<i>kiyyum</i>]. Rabbi Bon said: The sustainers [<i>okuminei</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Those who develop and sustain the world, namely people (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> Rabbi Elazar says: The <i>yekum</i> are the possessions that bolster the standing of their owner.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They help him stand [<i>lakum</i>].</i> Rabbi Shmuel says: The <i>yekum</i> is Cain,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In his regard it is written: “Cain arose [<i>vayakom</i>] against Abel his brother, and killed him” (Genesis 4:8).</i> who was washed away. “The stillborn is better than he” – this is Abel, his brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although Abel died young, comparable to a stillborn, he was better off than Cain, who suffered greatly and was not buried (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>Another matter, “If a man begets one hundred” – this is Ahab, who begot one hundred sons.

Rabbi Hoshaya said: Just as he had seventy sons in Samaria, so, too, he had seventy sons in Yizre’el,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, he had more than a hundred sons.</i> and each and every one of them had two palaces, one for the summer and one for the winter, as it is written: “I will smite the winter house with the summer house” (Amos 3:15).

Chapter 4

<b>“For he comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and in darkness his name is covered” (Ecclesiastes 6:4).</b><br>“For he comes in vanity, [and departs in darkness]” – is he without a lamp and without bathing?

Chapter 5

<b>“He has also not seen the sun, and did not know there is more gratification for that than for this” (Ecclesiastes 6:5).</b><br>“He has also not seen the sun, and did not know.” This is analogous to two people who were coming on a ship.

When he returned to the ship he said to his fellow: ‘Why did you not enter the country?’ He said to him: ‘You, who disembarked and entered, what did you see there?’ He said to him: ‘I saw much food, much drink, and tranquility.’ He said to him: ‘Did you enjoy it at all?’ He said to him: ‘No.’ He said to him: ‘I, who did not enter, am better off than you, as I did not disembark and did not see.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">He did not see what he was missing out on.</i> That is what is written: “There is more gratification for that than for this.”

<b>“For what advantage does the wise have over the fool, and how can the knowledgeable poor man walk before the living?” (Ecclesiastes 6:8).</b><br>“For what advantage does the wise have over the fool, and how can the knowledgeable poor man walk before the living?” Rather, what should he do?

Chapter 9

<b>“Better is the sight of the eyes than the pursuit of the desire; this, too, is vanity and herding wind” (Ecclesiastes 6:9).</b><br>“Better is the sight of the eyes than the pursuit of the desire” – better is one who explicates his learning than one who studies and gradually becomes accustomed to rote learning.

Chapter 10

<b>“What was, its name was already called, and it is known that he is man, and neither can he contend with what is mightier than he” (Ecclesiastes 6:10).</b><br>“What was, its name was already called” – this is Adam the first man, as it is stated: “The Lord God took the man” (Genesis 2:15), “and it is known that he is man.” This is analogous to a king and a minister who were in a royal carriage and the countrymen sought to say to the king, ‘Sire,’ but they did not know which one he was. What did the king do? He shoved [the minister] out of the carriage and everyone knew that he was the minister.

Whether they are good or bad they are Yours.’ This is analogous to a king who has a vineyard and he entrusts it to a sharecropper to toil in it. When it produces superior wine, the king says: ‘How fine is the wine of my vineyard!’ When it produces inferior wine, the king says: ‘How poor is the wine of the vineyard of my sharecropper.’ The sharecropper weeps and cries and says before him: ‘My lord the king, when it produces superior wine it is yours, and when it produces inferior wine it is mine? Whether it is good or bad it is yours.’ So too, Moses said: ‘Whether they are good or bad, they are Yours.’<br>“And neither can he contend with what is mightier than he.” When he said to Him: “Please, let me cross and see the good land” (Deuteronomy 3:25), the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Let it suffice you, do not speak to Me anymore about this matter” (Deuteronomy 3:26).<br>Another matter, “what was” – this is Jeremiah, and it is known to all that he is a prophet, as it is stated: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you” (Jeremiah 1:5).

Solomon made a statement and did not explain it, but his father David explained it. Solomon said: “For who knows what is good for man in his life… that he spends like a shadow?”<b> </b>How so?<b> </b>If you say it is the shadow of a wall, it has substance. If it is the shadow of a palm tree, it has substance. David came and explained: “His days pass like a shadow” (Psalms 144:4). David made a statement and did not explain it, but his son Solomon explained it. David said: “Man is like <i>hevel</i>” (Psalms 144:4); to what <i>hevel</i> [is man compared]? If it is to the <i>hevel</i> [heat] of an oven, it has significance. If it is to the <i>hevel</i> of a stove, it has significance. His son Solomon came and explained: “Vanity of vanities [<i>havel havalim</i>] said Kohelet” (Ecclesiastes 1:2).<br>Another matter, “for who knows what is good for man in his life” – Rabbi Pinḥas said: Since the days of man are vanity, and they are numbered, and they are like a shadow, what pleasure does one have in life? Rather, let them engage in matters of Torah, which are all life. “For who can tell man [what will be after him under the sun?]” – Solomon said, I will tell you what is better than them all: “A good name is better that fine oil” (Ecclesiastes 7:1).

Parasha 7



Chapter 1

<b>“A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death than the day of one's birth” (Ecclesiastes 7:1).</b><br>“A good name is better than fine oil.” Fine oil descends,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See Psalms 133:2.</i> a good name ascends.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 12:2.</i> Fine oil is temporary, a good name is eternal. Fine oil is finite, a good name is infinite. Fine oil costs money, a good name is free. Fine oil is for the living, a good name is for the living and for the dead. Fine oil is for the wealthy, a good name is for the poor and the wealthy. Fine oil wafts from the inner chamber to the banquet hall, a good name carries from one end of the world to the other end. Fine oil falls on a corpse and putrefies, as it is stated: “Flies of death putrefy and ferment blended oil” (Ecclesiastes 10:1). A good name falls on the dead and does not putrefy, as it is stated: “He went up and stretched himself upon the boy […and the lad opened his eyes]” (II Kings 4:35).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Elisha’s righteousness, which earned him a good name, allowed him to revive the dead.</i> Fine oil falls on water and disperses, a good name falls on water and does not disperse, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Jonah and it spewed Jonah out” (Jonah 2:11). Fine oil falls onto fire and burns, a good name falls on fire and does not burn, as it is written: “Then…they emerged [from within the fire]” (Daniel 3:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya.</i><br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: We have found those with fine oil who entered a place of life and emerged burned, and those with a good name who entered a place of death and emerged alive. Nadav and Avihu<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They had been anointed with the anointing oil.</i> entered a place of life and died.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Nadav and Avihu, who had been anointed to the priesthood with the anointing oil, entered the Tabernacle and were killed (see Leviticus 10:1–2).</i> Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya entered a fiery furnace and emerged alive. Therefore, it is stated: “A good name is better than fine oil…”
The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Go and appoint a High Priest for Me.’ [Moses] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, from which tribe?’ He said to him: ‘From the tribe of Levi.’ [Moses asked:] ‘With what will I anoint him?’ He said to him: ‘With the anointing oil.’ At that moment, Moses was joyful; he said: ‘My tribe is so beloved before the Holy One blessed be He.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘By your life, it is not your tribe, but it is your brother’ – that is what is written: “And you, bring [Aaron your brother] near to you” (Exodus 28:1). His anointing with the anointing oil, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “You shall take the anointing oil […and anoint him]” (Exodus 29:7). However, his service is not service and he has liability unless the names of the tribes are engraved on his heart, as it is written: “Aaron will bear the names…[of the children of Israel…upon his heart]” (Exodus 28:29). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The names of the tribes are dearer to me than the anointing oil with which priests and kings are anointed.’<br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Go and appoint a High Priest for Me.’ [Moses] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, from which tribe?’ He said to him: ‘From the tribe of Levi.’ [Moses asked:] ‘With what will I anoint him?’ He said to him: ‘With the anointing oil.’ At that moment, Moses was joyful; he said: ‘My tribe is so beloved before the Holy One blessed be He.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘By your life, it is not your tribe, but it is your brother; that is what is written: “And you, bring [Aaron your brother] near to you” (Exodus 28:1). His anointing with the anointing oil, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “You shall take the anointing oil […and anoint him]” (Exodus 29:7). However, his service is not service and he has liability unless the names of the tribes are engraved on his two shoulders, as it is written: “Aaron shall bear their names before the Lord upon his two shoulders as a remembrance” (Exodus 28:12). “Six of their names [on one stone and the names of the six that remain on the other stone]” (Exodus 28:10). Rav Beivai said: Had they been missing one letter they would not have served their purpose. Rabbi Oshaya taught: Even one dot.<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: There are three crowns; the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of kingship. The crown of priesthood, Aaron merited it and took it. The crown of kingship, David merited it and took it. The crown of Torah is available for [all] generations. Anyone who acquires Torah it is as though he acquired [all] three of them. Anyone who did not acquire Torah, it is as though he did not acquire any of them.<br>Rabbi Bon said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: We found that the Holy One blessed be He went a distance that takes five hundred years to traverse to make a name for Himself, as it is written: “[Who is like Your people, like Israel…] whom God went to redeem to Himself for a people and to make a name for Himself […nations and their gods]” (II Samuel 7:23). Rabbi Yosei HaGelili said: A nation and its gods.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He interprets the end of the verse to mean that God redeemed Israel despite the fact that there were idolaters among them who took their gods with them.</i> Rabbi Akiva said to him: You have rendered the sacred profane. The Israelites said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You redeemed Yourself, as it were, as it is stated: “Whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, nations and their God”’ (II Samuel 7:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, this would be translated as “their gods.”</i> It is written: “Whom God went [<i>halakh</i>] [to redeem] for Himself [a people]” (I Chronicles 17:21), and later it says: “Whom God went [<i>halekhu</i>] [to redeem for Himself for a people]” (II Samuel 7:23). <i>Halakh</i>, this is the Holy One blessed be He; <i>halekhu</i>, this is Moses and Aaron.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>halekhu</i> is plural, and therefore the midrash interprets it as referring to Moses and Aaron. Thus, the verse means that Moses and Aaron were emissaries God sent to accomplish this objective.</i>
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: A good name is more beloved than the Ark of the Covenant, as the Ark of the Covenant went only three days, as it is stated: “And the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord traveled before them [three days’ journey to seek out a resting place for them]” (Numbers 10:33), and a good name goes from one end of the world to the other end. From where do we derive it? It is from David, as it is stated: “The name of David went out to all the lands; and the Lord imposed fear of him upon all the nations” (I Chronicles 14:17). A good name is more beloved than priesthood and kingdom, as priesthood and kingdom lapsed, and a good name does not lapse.<br>The disciples of Rabbi Abba and Abba Tzidoni said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: The tribes are more beloved in their death than in their lifetimes, as during their lives, it was not stated: “Six of their names,” while after their deaths, it is stated: “Six of their names” (Exodus 28:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It was only after their deaths that remembrance of their names became a source of merit for their descendants.</i><br>Rabbi Yehuda said: Miriam and Yokheved were the midwives of the Israelites. As it is written: “The name of one was Shifra and the name of the second was Pu’a” (Exodus 1:15). Shifra, this is Yokheved, who would tend to [<i>mishaperet</i>] the children. Alternatively, it is because she procreated [<i>shepara verava</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">She gave birth to Moses at the age of one hundred and thirty.</i> Alternatively, it is because the Israelites procreated due to her. Alternatively, it is because they bettered [<i>shiperu</i>] [the Israelite women] with mitzvot and good deeds. Alternatively, Shifra [is the name given her] as praise [of her character], as it is stated: “With His breath the heavens were calmed [<i>shifra</i>]” (Job 26:13).<br>Pu’a, this is Miriam, as she would make a comforting sound [<i>po’a</i>] to the woman, and the child would emerge. Alternatively, Pu’a, as she would cry [<i>po’a</i>] and weep over her brother Moses who was cast into the Nile, as it is stated: “His sister stood at a distance” (Exodus 2:4). Alternatively, Pu’a, as she revealed [<i>hofia</i>] the actions of her brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">She prophesied about him before he was born (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Alternatively, as she stood boldly [<i>pa’at</i>] before Pharaoh and said to him: ‘Woe to you on the Day of Judgment.’<br>It is taught: A man is called by three names; one that his father and his mother called him, one that others called him, and one that he is called in the book of his lineage.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The book that the Holy One blessed be He wrote, which spans the time from Creation until the culmination of all the generations. One’s name in that book expresses the purpose for which one was created (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i>
Rabbi Pinḥas said: Man is beloved by his name, but I would not know which of them. Solomon came and explained: “A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death than the day of one's birth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is his name at the end of his life, when he dies, that is most important.</i> When a person is born, one counts to his death. When he dies, one counts his life. When he is born everyone is joyous; when he dies, everyone weeps. But that should not be so; rather, when a person is born no one should be joyous, as they do not know the challenges and actions that will confront him, and whether he will be righteous or wicked, good or bad. When he dies, they should rejoice that he passed away with a good name and departed from the world in peace. This is analogous to two ships at sail in the Mediterranean Sea; one was leaving the port and one was entering the port. Regarding the one leaving the port, everyone rejoiced, and regarding the one leaving the port, they did not rejoice. There was one clever person there. He said to them: ‘I see matters to the contrary. Regarding the one leaving the port, they should not rejoice with it, because they do not know what challenges will confront it, how many days it will be challenged, how many storms it will encounter. When it enters the port, everyone should rejoice that in entered in peace.’ Similarly, when a person dies, everyone should rejoice, and praise him that he passed away in peace from the world with a good name. That is what Solomon said: “And the day of death than the day of one's birth.”<br>You find that when the righteous are born no one is aware of it, and when they die, everyone is aware of it. When Miriam was born, no one was aware of it and when she died, the spring vanished, and everyone was aware. The spring publicized her death.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">A spring of water miraculously accompanied Israel through the wilderness, on Miriam’s account. When she died, the spring disappeared and the people thirsted for water (<i>Ta’anit</i> 9a).</i> When Aaron the High Priest was born, no one was aware of it, and when he died, the clouds of glory vanished, and everyone was aware. The cloud publicized his death. When Moses our master was born, no one was aware of it, and when he died, everyone was aware. The manna publicized his death. When Joshua was born, no one was aware of it, and when he died, everyone was aware, as it is stated: “They buried him on the border [of his inheritance]…north of Mount Gaash” (Joshua 24:30). The Rabbis say: We reviewed the entire Bible and we did not find a place named Mount Gaash. Rather, what is Mount Gaash? [It is a reference to the fact that] because they were preoccupied [<i>nitga’ashu</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">They were involved in settling the land.</i> and were negligent in performing acts of kindness to Joshua,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">They did not express their respects for him when he died.</i> the Holy One blessed be He sought to quake and spew [<i>lehagish</i>] lava upon them in order to destroy them. [They were preoccupied] because the Land of Israel had been distributed and its distribution was too dear to them; this one was involved in his field, that one was involved in his vineyard, this one was involved in his olive grove, that one was involved in his charcoal. They were all involved in their labor, and that is why the Holy One blessed be He sought to quake the world upon them. Therefore, everyone was aware of it, and his death was publicized.<br>When David was born, no one was aware of it, but when he died everyone was aware of it, as it is stated: “When Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay with his fathers, [and that Yoav, commander of the army, had died]” (I Kings 11:21). Rabbi Pinḥas said: Is laying not death?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Why does the verse use two different expressions for death with regard to David and Yoav?</i> Rather, for David, who was king, [the term] lying is written;<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This is a less direct and therefore more respectful term than the term death.</i> for Yoav, who was commander of the army, [the term] death is written. Alternatively, is laying not death? Rather, for David, who was anointed with the anointing oil, [the term] lying is written; for Yoav, who was not anointed with the anointing oil, [the term] death is written. Alternatively, is laying not death? Rather, for David, who died in his bed, [the term] lying is written; for Yoav, who was killed, [the term] death is written. Alternatively, is laying not death? Rather, for David, whose sons inherited his position, [the term] lying is written; for Yoav, whose sons did not inherit his position, [the term] death is written. Therefore, everyone was aware of it when David died, as Solomon publicized his death.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">By inheriting David’s position.</i><br>When Samuel was born, no one was aware of it, but when he died everyone was aware of it, as it is stated: “Samuel died and…all Israel eulogized him” (I Samuel 25:1). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The parable says: One who is bitten by a snake, a rope frightens him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since the people had almost been destroyed due to the insufficient honor they accorded Joshua upon his death, they were very careful to pay the proper respects when Samuel died (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: They gave him his due, as it is stated: “He went each and every year and circulated in Beit El, [Gilgal, and Mitzpa, and he judged Israel in all those places]” (I Samuel 7:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since he made himself available to the people in so many different places, they all accorded him respect.</i> One verse says: “Samuel died” (I Samuel 25:1), and one verse says: “Samuel had died” (I Samuel 28:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Whey does the book of Samuel report Samuel’s death in two separate locations?</i> Rabbi Asi said: “Samuel had died,” certainly [informs of his] death. “Samuel died,” the matters are stated only with regard to Naval, as it is stated: “Samuel died…there was a man in Maon” (I Samuel 25:1–2).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In chapter 28, the book of Samuel reports the death of Samuel as its own event, and recounts the people’s eulogies for him. In chapter 25, the book mentions Samuel’s death in passing in order to provide context for the incident involving Naval, who threw a celebration at this time and was stingy toward David.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Everyone was mourning and clapping hands [in grief] over the death of the righteous one, and this wicked one [Naval] was making drinking parties. Rabbi Yehuda said: This is to teach you that anyone who repudiates acts of kindness, it is as though he repudiates the fundamental doctrine.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the doctrine of belief in God. Naval refused to bestow kindness on David, and of him it is said: “The scoundrel [<i>naval</i>] says in his heart: There is no God” (Psalms 14:1) (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> But King David, may he rest in peace, what would he do? He would perform acts of kindness for everyone. He would say thus: Even a killer, or one who was killed, even a pursuer, or one who is pursued, I perform acts of kindness for him as I do for the righteous. That is what is written: “But I, in Your mercy I trust; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation, I will sing to the Lord, because He has been kind to me [<i>gamal alai</i>]” (Psalms 13:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Because I have accepted the responsibility of performing acts of kindness [<i>ole gemilat ḥesed</i>], I will merit to rejoice in God’s salvation (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i>

Chapter 2

<b>“It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will take it to heart” (Ecclesiastes 7:2).</b><br>“It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting.” Why? It is because “the heart of the wise is in a house of mourning” (Ecclesiastes 7:4), as anyone who mourns, the Holy One blessed be He brings him joy, as it is stated: “The humble will increase their joy in the Lord” (Isaiah 29:19).<br>Another matter, “it is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting” – it is better to adopt a mode of conduct for which there is a recompense, than a mode of conduct for which there is no recompense.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Just as one pays respects to the dead, others will pay their respects to him when he dies. But regarding feasting, it is not clear that he who attends a feast will himself conduct a feast.</i> It is better to adopt a mode of conduct that serves the living and the dead, than a mode of conduct that serves only the living. It is better to adopt a mode of conduct that serves both the wealthy and the poor, than a mode of conduct that serves only the wealthy. It is better to adopt a mode of conduct that involves consolation, than a mode of conduct that does not involve consolation.
Rabbi Berekhya said: Performing acts of kindness is in the Torah at its beginning, in its middle, and at its end. It is at its beginning, as it is written: “The Lord God built the rib [that he took from the man, into a woman, and He brought her to the man]” (Genesis 2:22). [This verse] teaches that the Holy One Blessed be He braided Eve’s hair, and brought her to Adam, and he became the groomsman for them; as in the coastal towns, they call braiding, building. It is in its middle, as it is written: “The Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre” (Genesis 18:1), teaching that He visited him.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">God visited Abraham, who was recovering from his circumcision.</i> “God blessed Isaac his son” (Genesis 25:11), this is the blessing of the mourners.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">He came to console Isaac upon the death of Abraham.</i> At its end, as it is stated: “He buried him in the valley” (Deuteronomy 34:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">God buried Moses.</i><br>Rabbi Ḥanin said: What is the measure of recompense [for acts of kindness]? Jacob died in the land of Egypt. For whom was it fitting to tend to him? Is it not the Holy One blessed be He, who said to him: “I will descend with you to Egypt [and I will also take you up]” (Genesis 46:4)? Joseph came and snatched the mitzva for himself, as it is written: “Joseph ascended to bury his father” (Genesis 50:7). Joseph died in Egypt. For whom was it fitting to tend to him? Is it not the tribes, to whom he administered an oath, as it is stated: “Joseph administered an oath [to the sons of Israel, saying: God will surely remember you, and you shall carry up my bones from here]” (Genesis 50:25). Moses came and snatched the mitzva for himself, as it is stated: “Moses took Joseph’s bones” (Exodus 13:19). Moses died, and the Holy One blessed be He, in His glory, repaid him, as it is stated: “He buried him in the valley” (Deuteronomy 34:6).
It is written: “The Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them” (Genesis 3:21). We have found that the Holy One blessed be He performs acts of kindness: He adorns brides, blesses grooms, visits the ill, buries the dead, and comforts the mourners. He adorns brides, as it is written: “The Lord God built [the rib that he took from the man into a woman, and He brought her to the man]” (Genesis 2:22). Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He built her, adorned her, and showed her to him [Adam]. Rabbi Abbahu said: Perhaps you will say that He showed her to him from behind a carob tree or from behind a sycamore tree; rather, He adorned her with twenty-four types of jewelry and then He showed her to him, as it is stated: “And He brought her to the man” (Genesis 2:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Although she was made from his rib, and would naturally have been right next to him, the verse states that God brought her to him. This implies that He took her to another location to adorn her and then brought her to Adam (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i> He blesses grooms, as it is stated: “God blessed them” (Genesis 1:28). He visits the ill, as it is stated: “The Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre” (Genesis 18:1). He buries the dead, as it is written: “He buried him in the valley” (Deuteronomy 34:6). He comforts the mourners, as it is written: “He called its name Alon Bakhut” (Genesis 35:8). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: What is Alon Bakhut? While he was observing the mourning for Deborah, his nursemaid, tidings reached him that his mother Rebecca had died, and he wept two weepings [<i>bekhiyot</i>]; that is why it is stated [that Jacob called that place] Alon Bakhut. And [the verse] states regarding Jacob: “[And God appeared to Jacob again…] and blessed [him]” (Genesis 35:9) – He blessed him with the blessing of the mourners.
Rabbi Simon said: We have found that [people] went to a house of feasting and their names were not specified, [and people went] to a house of mourning and their names were specified. Og went to Abraham’s feast and his name was not specified. Job’s three comrades went to the house of mourning and their names were specified.<br>We have found that [people] went to a house of feasting and they were not spared from Gehenna, and [people] went to a house of mourning and they were spared from Gehenna. Og was at Abraham’s feast and he was not spared from Gehenna. Those who went to the house of mourning were spared from Gehenna. Rabbi Yissakhar of Kefar Mandi said: It is the way of the wicked to be consigned to the lowest level of Gehenna, as it is stated: “He strikes them in the place of the wicked” (Job 34:26). Job’s three comrades went to the house of mourning and they were spared from Gehenna, as it is written: “Each man came from his place” (Job 2:11). Each from his home, each from his city, each from his land, is not written here, but rather, “each from his place” – from the place that was established for them in Gehenna. They were spared and rescued from it.<br>We have found that [people] went to a house of feasting and the Divine Spirit did not rest upon them; this is Og. Job’s three comrades went to a house of mourning and the Divine Spirit rested upon them. That is what is written: “Elifaz answered” (Job 4:1), “Bildad answered” (Job 8:1). It is taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: Any place where answering [<i>aniya</i>], saying [<i>amira</i>], and so [<i>ko</i>, <i>kakha</i>] are stated, these statements were made in the sacred tongue and with [the inspiration of] the Divine Spirit.
Why does the verse state: “And the living will take it to heart”? Perform an act of kindness so they will perform it for you: Accompany [the dead] so they will accompany you; eulogize, so they will eulogize you; bury, so they will bury you; perform kindness, so kindness will be performed for you.

Chapter 3

<b>“Anger is better than laughter, as with a cross countenance the heart will be bettered” (Ecclesiastes 7:3).</b><br>“Anger is better than laughter.” Solomon said: Had [my] father been a little angry at Adoniya, it would have been better for him than the laughter with which the attribute of justice mocked him. Why? It is because “with a cross countenance the heart will be bettered.” Had he shown him a cross countenance, he would have caused him to better his ways. Instead, “his father had never aggrieved him” (I Kings 1:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Ultimately, this lead to Adoniya’s attempt to sieze power, and his eventual death. See I Kings chapters 1–2.</i> Likewise regarding Amnon, had David his father been a little angry with him, it would have been better for him than the laughter which which the attribute of justice mocked him. Why? It is because “with a cross countenance the heart will be bettered.” Instead, “Amnon alone is dead” (II Samuel 13:32).<br>Another matter, “anger is better than laughter” – had the Holy One blessed be He been angry at the generation of the Flood, it would have been better than the laughter with which the attribute of justice mocked them, as it is stated: “Their offspring are established before them” (Job 21:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Had the Holy One blessed be He shown them anger, they would have improved their ways, and died in peace with their offspring surrounding them.</i> Another matter, “anger is better than laughter” – had the Holy One blessed be He been angry at the Sodomites, it would have been better than the laughter with which the attribute of justice mocked them, as it is stated: “Their houses are safe, without fear” (Job 21:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">That would have been their plight.</i>

Chapter 4

<b>“The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning, and the heart of fools in the house of rejoicing” (Ecclesiastes 7:4).</b><br>“The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning.” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is analogous to one who said to his servant: ‘Go out and bring me a fine object.’ He said to him: ‘Where do I find a fine object?’ He said to him: ‘Where you find a multitude of people going, there is a fine object.’

Chapter 5

<b>“It is better to hear the rebuke of a wise man, than for a man to hear the song of fools” (Ecclesiastes 7:5).</b><br>“It is better to hear the rebuke of a wise man,” these are the deliverers of homilies. “Than for a man to hear the song of fools,” these are the disseminators, who raise their voices in song so the people will hear.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">When the Sages of talmudic times would deliver public lectures, they would state a teaching in a low voice to disseminators, who would then repeat it loudly for the assembled crowd.</i> Alternatively, “it is better to hear the rebuke of a wise man” – these are the rebukes delivered by Moses. “Than for a man to hear the song of fools” – these are the blessings of the wicked Bilam, through which their hearts<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The hearts of the Israelites.</i> became haughty, and they had their downfall at Shitim.

Chapter 6

<b>“For like the crackling of brambles under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool; this, too, is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 7:6).</b><br>“For like the crackling of brambles under the pot” – Rabbi Levi son of Rabbi Ze’eira would state a request of permission:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">He would do so at the beginning of his addresses, requesting the audience’s permission.</i> All the trees, when they are ignited, their sound does not carry; however, these brambles when they are ignited, their sound carries.

Chapter 7

<b>“For exploitation disconcerts a wise man, and destroys the gift of understanding” (Ecclesiastes 7:7).</b><br>“For exploitation [<i>haoshek</i>] disconcerts a wise man” – disputes [<i>esek</i>] in which Torah scholars are engaged, with each other, “disconcerts a wise man” – it confuses one’s wisdom.<br> “And destroys the gift of understanding” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: I learned eighty <i>halakhot</i> from Yehuda Ben Pedaya regarding the plowing of a grave, but because I was engaged [<i>asuk</i>] in the needs of the masses, I forgot them. Who is a Torah scholar? Rabbi Abbahu [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Anyone who cancels his engagements for the sake of his studies. It is taught: Anyone whom, when they ask him about a <i>halakha</i> from his studies, he provides an answer.
Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai had five disciples.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">They are listed in Avot (2:8): Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkanos, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya, Rabbi Yosei HaKohen, Rabbi Shimon ben Netanel ,and Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh.</i> As long as he was alive, they would sit before him. When he died, they went to Yavne, but Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh went to his wife in Emmaus, a place with good water and a beautiful view. He waited for them to come to him, but they did not come. When they did not come, he sought to go to them, but his wife did not allow him to do so. She said: ‘Who is in need of whom?’ He said to her: ‘They are in need of me.’ She said to him: ‘A leather container [of food] and mice, which typically goes to which; the mice to the container, or the container to the mice?’ He heeded her and remained until he forgot his learning. Sometime later they came to him and asked him: ‘A wheat loaf or a barley loaf, which can be eaten faster with a relish?’<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The garments of one who enters a leprous house become ritually impure only if he remains in the house long enough to recline and eat half a loaf of wheat bread, not barley bread, with a relish. They asked Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh: When the Sages clarified that this halakha is determined by the time it takes to eat wheat bread, is that a leniency because it takes longer to eat wheat bread than it takes to eat barley bread, or is it a stringency because it takes less time to eat wheat bread than barley bread?</i> He did not know how to respond to them, or the meaning of “with relish [<i>liftan</i>].” Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yosei say: It is two food items joined [<i>lefutin</i>] together.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">When one eats bread with another food, the food accompanying the bread is referred to as <i>liftan</i>.</i><br>Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] would appoint two appointees each year.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">One served as head of the yeshiva and one as president of the court (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> If they were worthy, they would endure; if not, they would die. As Rabbi’s death neared, he said to his son: ‘Do not do so, but rather, appoint them all at once,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Appoint the two new appointees, as well as the order of who will take over for them upon their passing (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> and appoint Rabbi Ḥanina as leader [of them all].’ Why had [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi himself] not appointed him? Rabbi Yosei bar Zevid said: It is because the residents of Tzippori denounced him. Did [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi decide how to] act based on their denunciations? They denounce many in this way; if we heed them in his regard, we must heed them regarding others as well. Rabbi Bon said:<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentaries add detail that appears to be missing from the midrash here, but is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta’anit</i> 4:2): Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was delivering a public lecture and cited a verse in Ezekiel (7:15), and Rabbi Ḥanina corrected his pronunciation of the Hebrew word <i>homot</i>, which Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had pronounced <i>homiyot</i>. This caused public embarrassment to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi] said to [Rabbi Ḥanina]: ‘Before whom did you learn that reading?’ He said to him: ‘Before Rav Hamnuna, the Bible expert of Babylon.’ He said to him: ‘When you go there, tell him that I appointed you to serve as an elder.’ [Rabbi Ḥanina] knew that he would not be appointed in [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s] days. When [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi] died, his son sought to appoint [Rabbi Ḥanina], but he did not accept it upon himself. He said: ‘I do not accept, but rather defer to Rabbi Afes of the south.’ There was one elder there who said: ‘If Rabbi Ḥanina is first, I am second. If Rabbi Afes is first, I am second.’ Rabbi Ḥanina accepted upon himself to be appointed third, and he was privileged to live a very long life. He said: ‘I do not know why I was privileged to live a very long life, whether it was because of this matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">That I deferred to Rabbi Afes and to the other elder.</i> or whether it was because when I would ascend from Tiberias to Tzippori I would take a detour to visit Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta. I do not know which of these two [is the reason.]’<br>Another matter: “For exploitation disconcerts a wise man” – the exploitation of Datan and Aviram, exploiting Moses their master, caused his wisdom to be lost from him. “And destroys the gift of [<i>matana</i>] understanding” – [the word <i>matana</i>] is written [in such a way that it can also be vocalized] <i>metuna</i>, patience. Had Moses been patient, he would have been spared. However, because they provoked him and caused him to become upset, and they said to him: “May the Lord look upon you [and judge, for you have made us loathsome in the eyes of Pharaoh]” (Exodus 5:21), he could not tolerate it, and, as a result, he became upset in his anger and said [to God]: “Since I came [to Pharaoh to speak in Your name…You have not rescued Your people]” (Exodus 5:23). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I wrote about you that you are wise, and you become upset and say this to me? By your life, you should know and inform others that the ultimate fate of My children will be better than the beginning that I provided them in Egypt,’ as it is written: “Now you will see [what I will do to Pharaoh, as with a strong hand he will send them out, and with a strong hand he will drive them from his land]” (Exodus 5:24). At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Woe for those who are lost and cannot be found. I lost Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who never doubted Me, and I have not found anyone who is their equal.’ At that moment, the attribute of justice sought to harm [Moses], as it is stated: “God [<i>Elohim</i>] spoke [to Moses]” (Exodus 6:2), and <i>Elohim</i> [indicates] nothing other than the attribute of justice. And it is stated: “And He said to him: I am the Lord” (Exodus 6:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This second half of the verse refers to God as the Lord [Y-H-V-H], which indicates the attribute of mercy. This indicates that after considering harming Moses, God acted mercifully toward him.</i> He said to [Moses]: ‘You are flesh and blood and unable to bear them.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">You are unable to bear their suffering, and that is why you criticized Me.</i> I am the Lord, merciful, the Master of mercy, with My attributes, I will have mercy,’ as it is stated: “I have made and I will bear” (Isaiah 46:4).

Chapter 8

<b>“The end of a matter is better than its beginning; one of patient spirit is better than one of proud spirit” (Ecclesiastes 7:8).</b><br>“The end of a matter is better than its beginning.” Rabbi Meir was sitting and expounding in the study hall of Tiberias, and his teacher, Elisha, was passing in the marketplace, riding on a horse on Shabbat. They said to Rabbi Meir: ‘Your teacher Elisha is coming and passing in the marketplace on Shabbat.’ He emerged to him. [Elisha] said to him: ‘In what were you engaged?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘“The Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning”’ (Job 42:12). he [continued and] said to him: ‘“Blessed” [indicates] that He doubled his possessions for him.’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Akiva, your teacher, did not say so, but rather “the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning,” thanks to the repentance and good deeds that he had to his credit from his beginning.’<br>[Elisha] said to [Rabbi Meir]: ‘What else did you say?’ [Rabbi Meir answered:] “The end of a matter is better than its beginning.” [Elisha] said to him: ‘What did you say in its regard?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘You have a person who purchases merchandise in his youth and he loses [money on it], and [he engages in commerce] in his old age and he makes a profit. Alternatively, “the end of a matter is better than its beginning” – you have a person who begets children in his youth and they die, [and he begets children] in his old age, and they endure. Alternatively, “the end of a matter is better than its beginning” – you have a person who performs wicked deeds in his youth, and in his old age, performs good deeds. Alternatively, “the end of a matter is better than its beginning” – you have a person who studies Torah in his youth and forgets it, and in his old age he returns to it; that is what is written: “the end of a matter is better than its beginning.”’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Rabbi Akiva, your teacher, did not say so; rather [he explained the verse to mean:] “The end of a matter” is good when it is good “from its beginning.”<br>‘Likewise, there was an incident: Avuya, my father, was one of the prominent leaders of the generation. When he came to circumcise me, he invited all the prominent residents of Jerusalem and all the prominent leaders of the generation, and invited Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua with them. When they had eaten and drunk, some began to sing songs and others recited alphabetical poems. Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua: ‘These are engaging in their [areas of interest], but we are not engaging in ours.’ They began with the Torah, from the Torah to the Prophets, and from the Prophets to the Writings, and the matters were as joyous as when they were given at Sinai, and the fire was burning around them. In their original giving at Sinai, were they not given in fire, as it is stated: “The mountain was ablaze with fire to the heart of the heavens” (Deuteronomy 4:11). [Avuya] said: ‘Since the power of the Torah is so great, this son, if he endures, I will dedicate him to the Torah.’ Because his intention was not for the sake of Heaven, my Torah did not endure in me.’<br>[Elisha said to Rabbi Meir:] ‘And what else did you say [in your lecture]?’ [Rabbi Meir answered:] ‘“It cannot be valued like gold and glass”’ (Job 28:17). [Elisha asked:] ‘What did you say in its regard?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘These are matters of Torah that are as difficult to acquire as gold and glass.’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Akiva, your teacher, did not say so; rather, just as vessels of gold and glass, if they break they can be repaired, so too, a Torah scholar, if he lost his learning, he can return to it.<br>[Elisha] said to him: ‘Return and enter [the city].’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘Why?’ [Elisha said:] ‘The Shabbat boundary ends here.’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘How do you know?’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘From the [number of] steps my horse [has taken, I can tell] that it has already gone two thousand cubits.’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘You have all this wisdom and you do not repent?’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘I do not have the strength.’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘Why?’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘I was riding a horse and was sauntering behind the Temple on Yom Kippur that coincided with Shabbat. I heard a Divine Voice crying out and saying: “Return wayward children” (Jeremiah 3:22), “return to Me and I will return to you” (Malachi 3:7), except for Elisha ben Avuya, who was aware of My might and rebelled against Me.’<br>From where did he have this?<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">What caused Elisha to forsake the Torah to begin with?</i> He saw a certain person who climbed to the top of a palm tree on Shabbat. He took the mother bird with the fledglings and climbed down unharmed. After Shabbat, he saw a certain person who climbed to the top of a palm tree, took the fledglings, and sent the mother away. He climbed down and a snake bit him and he died. [Elisha] said: ‘It is written: “Send away the mother bird and take the fledglings for yourself so it will be good for you and you will prolong your days” (Deuteronomy 22:7). Where is the good of this one? Where are the prolonged days of this one?’ But he did not know that Rabbi Akiva had expounded it: “So it will be good for you,” in the world that is entirely good; “and you will prolong your days,” in the world that is eternally long [the World to Come].<br>And some say it was because he saw the tongue of Rabbi Yehuda the baker in the mouth of a dog. He said: ‘If for the tongue that toiled in Torah throughout his life it is so, for the tongue that does not know and does not toil in Torah, all the more so. He said: If so, there is no reward given to the righteous and no revival of the dead.’ And some say it was because when his mother was pregnant with him, she passed by houses of idol worship and smelled,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">She smelled the aroma of the offerings being sacrificed and craved them.</i> and they gave her some of that kind, and she ate it, and it was churning in her stomach like the venom of a snake.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Because Elisha’s mother had eaten from the idolatrous sacrifice, Elisha had an ingrained desire for sin (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>Sometime later, Elisha ben Avuya fell ill. They came and said to Rabbi Meir: ‘Elisha is ill.’ [Rabbi Meir] went to him and said: ‘Repent.’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Is [repentance] accepted even in such [circumstances]?’ [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘But is it not written: “You turn man to contrition [<i>daka</i>] [and say: Return, son of man]” (Psalms 90:3) – until his soul is crushed?’<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>daka</i> can mean contrition or crushed. Thus, the verse is interpreted to mean that God wants man to repent even if it is at the very end of his life.</i> At that moment, Elisha ben Avuya wept, and he died. Rabbi Meir was glad and said: ‘It appears that my teacher departed in the midst of repentance.’<br>When they buried him, fire came to burn his grave. They came and said to Rabbi Meir: ‘The grave of your teacher is burning.’ He emerged and spread his garment over it. [Rabbi Meir] said to [Elisha]: ‘“Stay tonight” (Ruth 3:13), in this world that is entirely night. “It will be in the morning, if he will redeem you, good, he will redeem” (Ruth 3:13). What is: “It will be in the morning”? It is in the world that is totally good. “If he will redeem you, good, [he will redeem]”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">It is expounded as though it is written: “If the Good will redeem you.”</i> – this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is good to all” (Psalms 145:9). “But if he will be unwilling to redeem you, I will redeem you, as the Lord lives; lie until the morning”’ (Ruth 3:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Meir was requesting that Elisha be allowed to rest in peace as long as he himself was alive.

They will save Elisha due to the merit of his Torah.’<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the casing is saved from fire on Shabbat due to the scroll, Elisha should be saved due to his Torah.</i><br>Ultimately, his daughters came and demanded charity from Rabbeinu.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> He said: ‘“Let no one extend kindness to him; and let no one be gracious to his orphans”’ (Psalms 109:12). They said: ‘Rabbi, do not look at his actions, look at his Torah.’ At that moment, Rabbi wept and decreed that they should be supported. He said: ‘If one whose Torah was not for the sake of Heaven produced such,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Produced daughters with such wisdom and modest comportment; alternatively, this means if he produced a disciple such as Rabbi Meir (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> one whose Torah is for the sake of Heaven, all the more so.’<br>“One of patient spirit is better than one of proud spirit.” A certain Persian came to Rav [and] said to him: ‘Teach me Torah.’ [Rav] said to him: ‘Say <i>alef</i>.’ He said to [Rav]: ‘Who says that it is <i>alef</i>? Let them say that it is not so.’ ‘Say <i>bet</i>.’ He said to [Rav]: ‘Who says that it is <i>bet</i>? Let them say that it is not so.’ Rav scolded him and had him removed, with reprimand. He went to Shmuel [and] said to him: ‘Teach me Torah.’ [Shmuel] said to him: ‘Say <i>alef</i>.’ He said to [Shmuel]: ‘Who says that it is <i>alef</i>?’ ‘Say <i>bet</i>.’ He said to [Shmuel]: ‘Who says that it is <i>bet</i>?’ [Shmuel] pulled him by his ear.

That is, “one of patient spirit is better than one of proud spirit.” The patience that Shmuel extended the Persian is better than the exactitude with which Rav acted in his regard. Had he not done so, the Persian would have returned to his corruption.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Instead, he converted to Judaism and credited Shmuel for his patience.</i> He read in [Shmuel’s] regard: “One of patient spirit is better.”<br>Moreover, Aquila the proselyte<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">He had not yet converted.</i> asked Rabbi Eliezer, he said to him: ‘The love with which the Holy One blessed be He loves the proselyte is with only bread and garment, as it is stated: “He loves the proselyte, giving him bread and a garment” (Deuteronomy 10:18). [Yet] I have so many peacocks and so many pheasants that even my servants pay no attention to them.’ He said to him: ‘Is it insignificant in your eyes what our patriarch Jacob requested initially, as it is stated: “And He will give me bread to eat and a garment to wear” (Genesis 28:20)? Is that an insignificant matter?’<br>[Aquila] came before Rabbi Yehoshua and asked him this. [Rabbi Yehoshua] said to him: ‘A proselyte who converts for the sake of Heaven is privileged, and his daughters may marry into the priesthood. “Bread,” this is the showbread; “garment,” these are the priestly vestments.’ He drew him near with his words.

Why, then, do you dispatch him with a trifling matter?’<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, the disciples did not like Rabbi Yehoshua’s first homiletical interpretation. Alternatively, this critique was stated by Rabbi Eliezer’s disciples and belongs in the text before Aquila came to Rabbi Yehoshua (see <i>Matnot Kehuna</i> and <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 70:5).</i> He began to placate him with his words:<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehoshua told Aquila the following alternate interpretation of the verse.</i> ‘“Bread,” this is Torah, as it is stated: “Come partake of my bread” (Proverbs 9:5);<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is attributed in Proverbs to wisdom, which is personified and offers a speech.

Chapter 11

<b>“Wisdom is good with inheritance, and more so for viewers of the sun. For in the shadow of wisdom, in the shadow of money; the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its possessors” (Ecclesiastes 7:11–12).</b><br>“Wisdom is good with inheritance” – “wisdom is good” when it is an inheritance. Alternatively, “wisdom is good” when it is accompanied by inheritance, as we learned there in <i>Avot</i> (2:2): Torah study is best with a worldly occupation, etc. Alternatively, “wisdom is good” – the wisdom of Moses is good, as it is stated: “A wise man ascended against the city of the mighty” (Proverbs 21:22);<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Moses ascending heavenward to the stronghold of the angels to receive the Torah.</i> “with inheritance” – as he bequeathed the Torah to Israel.<br>Another matter, “wisdom is good” – this is the wisdom of Betzalel, who bequeathed the Ark to Israel. When Moses said to him: ‘Craft an Ark, vessels, and the Tabernacle,’ Betzalel said to him: ‘Moses our master, does one bring the vessels and position them exposed to the air? Let the Tabernacle be crafted first and the Ark be crafted afterward.’ Moses said to him: ‘Were you, perhaps, sitting in the shadow of God and you knew? First, “they shall craft the Ark” (Exodus 25:10) and then, “the Tabernacle you shall craft” (Exodus 26:1)’ – that is, “wisdom is good with inheritance,” the wisdom of Betzalel is good, “with inheritance,” as he bequeathed the Ark to Israel.<br>Another matter, the wisdom of Joshua is good “with inheritance,” as he bequeathed the land; “and more so for viewers of the sun.”<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the miracle performed for Joshua in which the sun’s orbit was delayed; see Joshua 10:12–13.</i> Alternatively, “wisdom is good” when it is accompanied by the merit of the forefathers.

You give half from yours and I will give half from mine, and they will go and sacrifice.’ Yannai gave them half [the required sum] and they went and sacrificed.

Chapter 13

<b>“See the work of God, for who can mend what He has warped?” (Ecclesiastes 7:13)</b><br>“See the work of God, for who can mend what He has warped?” When the Holy One blessed be He created Adam the first man, He took him and showed him all the trees in the Garden of Eden, and He said to him: ‘See My creations, how beautiful and exemplary they are. Everything I created, I created for you. Make certain that you do not ruin and destroy My world, as if you destroy it, there will be no one to mend it after you. Moreover, you will cause death to that righteous one.’<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Moses.</i> To what is the matter of [the death of] Moses our master analogous? [It is analogous] to a pregnant woman who was incarcerated in prison. She gave birth to a son, raised him, and she died there. Sometime later the king passed the entrance of the prison. As the king was passing, that son began screaming and he said: ‘My lord the king, I was born here, I grew up here; I do not know due to what sin am I placed here.’ [The king] said to him: ‘Due to your mother’s sin.’ So too regarding Moses, as it is written: “Behold, the man has become like one [of us]” (Genesis 3:22). And it is written: “Behold, your days are drawing near to die” (Deuteronomy 31:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Genesis was stated by God in explaining His removal of Adam from the Garden of Eden following his sin. The verbal analogy to the verse in Deuteronomy, which relates to Moses’s death, indicates that Moses died only due to the fact that death was decreed upon all people following the sin of Adam.</i>

Chapter 14

<b>“On a day of good fortune, enjoy, and on a day of misfortune, see: God made this as well as that; consequently, man cannot find out anything about it” (Ecclesiastes 7:14).</b><br>“On a day of good fortune, enjoy” – if a good day befalls you, act upon it immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Thank God with a thanksgiving offering or a thanksgiving banquet.</i> “And on a day of misfortune, see” – see how to repent and be spared from the punishment of Gehenna. Rabbi Yudan [said] in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Three matters nullify evil decrees: Prayer, charity [<i>tzedaka</i>], and repentance, and the three of them are in one verse; that is what is written: “If My people upon whom My name is called humble themselves, and pray, and seek My presence, and repent their evil ways, then I will hear from the heavens, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land” (II Chronicles 7:14). “And pray,” this is prayer; “seek My presence,” this is charity, as it is said: “I with righteousness [<i>betzedek</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>tzedek</i>, which means righteousness or justice, is from the same root as the word <i>tzedaka</i>, charity.</i> will behold Your presence” (Psalms 17:15); “and repent their evil ways,” this is repentance; “then I will hear from the heavens.” Rabbi Mana said: Fast, as well, as it is written: The Lord will answer you on a day of affliction” (Psalms 20:2).
Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥiyya interpreted the verse regarding the indigent and the wealthy. On the day of another’s good fortune, rejoice with him. “On a day of misfortune, see,” see how [ you can] support the indigent, such that you will receive reward due to them. This is what Rabbi Tanḥum would do: If he was accustomed to purchase a <i>litra</i> of meat, he would purchase two, one for his portion and one for the indigent; [similarly, he would purchase] two bunches of vegetables, one for him and one for the indigent. “[God made] this as well as that,” these are the wealthy and the indigent, so that each will benefit from the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">The indigent benefit from charity in this world, and the wealthy in the World to come.</i>
Rabbi Aḥa interpreted the verse regarding Torah. In its joy, rejoice. “And on a day of misfortune, see” – you will be among the onlookers, in whose regard it is written: “They will emerge and see the carcasses of the people” (Isaiah 66:24), and not among those who are seen, in whose regard it is written: “Their worm will not die” (Isaiah 66:24). “This as well as that,” these are Gehenna and the Garden of Eden. How much separates them? It is one handbreadth. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A wall. The Rabbis say: They are adjacent, so they can peek at one another.<br>Rabbi Levi interpreted the verse [as follows]: On the festivals that I gave you, rejoice and bring joy to the Holy One blessed be He with offerings. If a year comes without a drought, go out to your vineyard, look and rejoice, look at your olive trees and rejoice. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I did not create as good an advocate for rain as the day of <i>Shemini Atzeret</i>.’ That is what is written: “On the eighth day, an assembly [it shall be for you]” (Numbers 29:35).<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">It is on your behalf.</i>

Chapter 15

<b>“I have seen everything in the days of my vanity; there is a righteous person who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked person who endures in his wickedness” (Ecclesiastes 7:15).</b><br>“I have seen everything in the days of my vanity.” They asked Shmuel HaKatan, what is the meaning of what is written: “There is a righteous person who perishes in his righteousness”? He said to them: ‘It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that this righteous person is destined to be corrupted. The Holy One blessed be He says: I will remove him [from the world] while he is still in his state of righteousness, as it is stated: “There is a righteous person who perishes in his righteousness.”’<br>“And there is a wicked person who endures in his wickedness.” As long as a person is alive, the Holy One blessed be He anticipates his repentance; once he dies the hope for his [repentance] is lost, as it is stated: “When a wicked person dies, hope is lost” (Proverbs 11:7). [This is analogous] to a group of robbers who were incarcerated in prison. One of them dug a tunnel and they all fled. One of them remained there and did not flee. When the jailer came, he began striking him with a stick. He said to him: ‘Luckless and unfortunate one, you had a tunnel before you and you did not flee?’ So too, in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will say to the wicked: ‘You had [the opportunity for] repentance before you, and you did not repent?’ Consequently, “the eyes of the wicked will fail” (Job 11:20).<br>Due to three matters, Rabbi Yoshiya said that the Holy One blessed be He is patient with the wicked in this world: Perhaps they will repent, or perform mitzvot for which the Holy One blessed be He will reward them in this world, or perhaps righteous children will emerge from them. We see that He was patient with Aḥaz, and Hezekiah emerged from him; with Amon, [and] Josiah emerged from him; [with] Shimi, [and] Mordekhai emerged from him.

Chapter 16

<b>“Do not be overly righteous, and do not be exceedingly wise; why should you be be destroyed?” (Ecclesiastes 7:16)</b><br>“Do not be overly righteous, and do not be exceedingly wise.” “Do not be overly righteous” – more [righteous] than your Creator; this is a reference to Saul, as it is written: “Saul came to the city of Amalek [and lay in wait [<i>vayarev</i>] in the valley]” (I Samuel 15:5). Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Benaya say: He began deliberating against his Creator.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>vayarev</i>, generally translated as lay in wait, can also mean to argue or deliberate.</i> He said: So said the Holy One blessed be He: “Go and smite Amalek…[put to death both men and women, infant and suckling babes, ox and sheep, camel and donkey” (I Samuel 15:3); if the men sinned, what sin did the women commit? What sin did the children commit? What sin did the cattle, the ox, and the donkey commit? A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Do not be overly righteous;” [do not be] more [righteous] than your Creator.<br>The Rabbis say: He began to deliberate regarding the beheaded calf and say: The verse said: “They shall behead the calf there in the valley” (Deuteronomy 21:4); he kills and it is beheaded?<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">The ritual of the beheaded calf is performed when a person is found dead between two cities and the killer is unknown. The elders of the nearest city perform this ritual, in which a calf is beheaded. Saul was uncomfortable with this ritual, arguing that a calf should not be killed because one person killed another.</i> If a person sinned, what sin did the animal commit? A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Do not be overly righteous.”<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Anyone who becomes compassionate when he should be cruel will ultimately become cruel when he should be compassionate, as it is stated: “And Nov, the city of priests, he smote by sword” (I Samuel 22:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">This was carried out at Saul’s command.</i> Should Nov not be like descendants of Amalek? The Rabbis say: Anyone who becomes compassionate when he should be cruel, ultimately, the attribute of justice will harm him, as it is stated: “Saul and his three sons died” (I Samuel 31:6).

Chapter 17

<b>“Do not be overly wicked and do not be foolish; why should you die before your time?” (Ecclesiastes 7:17)</b><br>“Do not be overly wicked.” Rabbi Berekhya said: But a little bit is permitted? Rather, do not say: Because this is with rage, everything is with rage.<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">If God is already angry at him, it does not matter if he continues to sin.</i>

Chapter 18

<b>“It is good that you grasp this, and from that, too, do not withdraw your hand, for one who fears God will fulfill them all” (Ecclesiastes 7:18).</b><br>“It is good that you grasp this,” this is Bible, “and from that, too, do not withdraw your hand,” this is Mishna; “for one who fears God will fulfill them all,” like Rabbi Abbahu of Caesarea.

Chapter 19

<b>“Wisdom will bolster the wise more than ten rulers who are in a city” (Ecclesiastes 7:19).</b><br>“Wisdom will bolster the wise” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Wise of heart, mighty of strength” (Job 9:4); “more than ten rulers who are in a city” – than the ten statements with which the world was created.<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">People will be quicker to recognize God through Torah than by appreciating the miracle of His creation of the world (Maharzu).</i><br>Another matter, “wisdom will bolster the wise” – this is Adam the first man, as it is written: “You are the culmination of perfection, [full of wisdom]” (Ezekiel 28:12); “more than ten rulers who are in a city” – these are the ten organs that serve the soul: esophagus for food, trachea for voice, liver for wrath, gall bladder for envy, the lung drains,<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">It drains harmful fluids.</i> stomach to grind, spleen to crush, kidneys advise, heart understands, tongue concludes.<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">The tongue expresses a person’s thoughts.

Another matter, “wisdom will bolster the wise” – this is Noah; “more than ten rulers who are in a city” – more than the ten generations from Adam until Noah, as from all of them, He spoke only with him [Noah]. Alternatively, “wisdom will bolster the wise” – this is Abraham; “more than ten rulers” – more than the ten generations from Noah until Abraham, as the Holy One blessed be He chose from all of them and made a covenant only with him [Abraham], as it is stated: “On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram” (Genesis 15:18). Alternatively, “wisdom will bolster the wise” – this is Jacob; “more than ten rulers” – [Jacob had] more [wisdom] than the ten tribes that descended to Egypt and ascended [back to Canaan], and they did not know that Joseph was alive, but Jacob knew, as it is stated: “Jacob saw that there were provisions [<i>shever</i>] in Egypt” (Genesis 42:1), he knew that his hope [<i>shivro</i>] was in Egypt.
Another matter, “wisdom will bolster the wise” – this is Moses; “more than ten rulers” – more than the ten organs that serve the body, [and] which Moses subdued: [Food is generally brought] from the mouth to the esophagus, from the esophagus to the maw, from the maw to the stomach, from the stomach to the lower stomach, from the lower stomach to the duodenum, from the duodenum to the jejunum, from the jejunum to the ileum, from the ileum to the large intestine, from the large intestine to the colon, from the colon to the rectum, from the rectum to the anus, and from the anus outside. Moses did not need any of them, not to ingest and not to egest, as it is stated: “He was there with the Lord forty days…bread he did not eat and water he did not drink” (Exodus 34:28).
Another matter, “wisdom will bolster the wise” – this is Israel, as it is stated: “It is a particularly wise and understanding people” (Deuteronomy 4:6); “more than ten rulers” – more than the ten matters that serve the soul: Esophagus for food, trachea for voice, liver for wrath, gall bladder for envy, the lung drains, stomach to grind, spleen to crush, kidneys advise, heart understands, tongue concludes.<br>Another matter, “wisdom will bolster the wise” – this is David; “more than ten rulers” – more than the ten elders who spoke in the book of Psalms, and they are: Adam the first man, Abraham, Moses, David, and Solomon. Regarding these five there is no dispute; who are the other five? Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rav said: Asaf, Heman, Yedutun, the three sons of Koraḥ, who are [considered] one, and Ezra. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Asaf here is Asaf there,<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Aviasaf, one of the sons of Koraḥ.</i> but, because he was a learned man, he was privileged to recite songs with his brother and he was privileged to recite songs on his own. According to Rav, it was a different Asaf, as it is stated: “Under the hand of Asaf, who prophesied according to the direction of the king” (I Chronicles 25:2).<br>Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rav said: Literally “for Yedutun” (Psalms 39:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">When the verse states: “For the leader, for Yedutun, a psalm of David” (Psalms 39:1), it actually means that it was authored by Yedutun.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “For Yedutun” [means that the psalmist] prophesied regarding the edicts [<i>datin</i>] and the punishments that befell him and Israel. Rabbi Huna [said] in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Even though ten people spoke in the book of Psalms, it is not attributed to them, but to David king of Israel. They stated a parable, to what is the matter analogous? To a group of people who seek to recite a hymn to the king. The king said to them: ‘You are all fine, you are all pious, you are all worthy of reciting a hymn before me; but so-and-so will recite it on behalf of all of you. Why? Because his voice is sweet.’ So too, when the ten righteous men sought to recite the book of Psalms, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘You are all fine, pious, and worthy to recite a hymn before Me, but David will recite it on behalf of all of you. Why? Because his voice is sweet.’ That is what is written: “The sweet singer of Israel” (II Samuel 23:1).

Chapter 20

<b>“For there is not a righteous man upon the earth, who does good, and does not sin” (Ecclesiastes 7:20).</b><br>“For there is not a righteous man upon the earth who does good, and does not sin.” Rabbi Yudan said: Is there a righteous man who sins? These are the charity collectors and the charity distributors; [they give to [those who are deserving what should be given to] the undeserving, and they give to the undeserving [what should be given to] the deserving. “And does not sin [<i>yeḥta</i>],” just as you say: “Each one could sling stones at a hair, and not miss [<i>yaḥti</i>]” (Judges 20:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">The term “sin” here should not be interpreted to mean a spiritual failing, as there is no way to always determine who is most deserving. It is used in the sense of one who aims at a target and misses. Therefore, one should not refrain from charity due to the concern that one may distribute it to those who are not most deserving.</i>

<b>“All this I attempted with wisdom; I said: I will become wise, but it is far from me” (Ecclesiastes 7:23).</b><br>“All this I attempted with wisdom.” It is written: “God granted wisdom to Solomon, [great discernment, and breadth of understanding like the sand on the seashore]” (I Kings 5:9). The Rabbis and Rabbi Levi, the Rabbis say: “Like the sand” – what is “like the sand”? He was granted wisdom corresponding to all of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is compared to the sand on the seashore; see Genesis 22:17.</i> Rabbi Levi said: Just as this sand is a boundary for the sea, so, too, wisdom was a boundary for Solomon.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">It prevented him from sinning.</i> The parable says: If you lack knowledge, what have you acquired? If you have acquired wisdom, what are you lacking?<br>It is written: “Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt” (I Kings 5:10). What was the wisdom of the people of the East? They were well-versed in astronomy, performed sorcery with birds, and were expert in augury. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Regarding three matters I praise the people of the East: They do not kiss on the mouth, but rather on the hand; they do not bite [pieces of food from a larger piece] with their mouth but cut with a knife; and they seek counsel only in a spacious area, as they consult only in the field.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">This is to ensure that there are no eavesdroppers.</i><br>What was the wisdom of the Egyptians? You find that when Solomon sought to build the Temple, he sent to Pharaoh Nekho and said: ‘Send me craftsmen [and I will pay] their wage, as I seek to build the Temple.’ What did he [Pharaoh] do? He assembled all his astrologers, and they envisioned people who were destined to die during that year and he sent them to him. When they came to Solomon, he envisioned with the divine spirit that they were destined to die during that year. He gave them shrouds and sent them [back] to [Pharaoh Nekho], and said to him: ‘If you did not have shrouds for the needs of your dead, here they are with their shrouds; arise and bury them.’<br> “He was wiser than any man [<i>ha’adam</i>]” (I Kings 5:11) – than Adam the first man. What was the wisdom of Adam the first man? You find that when the Holy One blessed be He sought to create Adam the first man, He consulted with the ministering angels, and He said to them: “Let us make man” (Genesis 1:26). They said to him: ‘Master of the universe, “what is man that You remember him?”’ (Psalms 8:5). He said to them: ‘The man I seek to create, his wisdom is greater than yours.’ What did He do? He gathered all the animals, beasts, and birds, and stood them before them [the angels], and said to them: ‘Give them names.’ They remained [silent] and did not know [what to say]. He went to Adam and said to him: ‘What [should] the names of these [creatures be]?’ [Adam] said: ‘Master of the universe, it is fitting to call this one ox, this one lion, this one horse, this one camel, this one eagle,’ and so forth for all of them. [God] said to him: ‘What is your name?’ He said before Him: ‘Adam, because I was created from the ground [<i>adama</i>].’ [God said:] ‘And I, what is My name?’ He said before Him: ‘You are my Lord [<i>adonai</i>], because You are the Lord [<i>adon</i>] over all Your creations’ – that is what is written: “I am the Lord, it is My name” (Isaiah 42:8), it is My name that I was called by Adam the first man. It is My name that I stipulated between Me and Myself. It is My name that I stipulated between Myself and My creations and My ministering angels.<br>“[For he was wiser than all men: than Eitan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Kalkol, and Darda, the sons of Maḥol]” (I Kings 5:11). “Than Eitan the Ezrahite,” this is Abraham, as it is written: “A contemplation of Eitan the Ezrahite” (Psalms 89:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbinic tradition identifies Eitan the Ezrahite of Psalms as Abraham; see <i>Bava Batra</i> 15a.</i> “And Heman,” this is Moses, as it is stated: “In all My house he is trusted [<i>ne’eman</i>]” (Numbers 12:7). “And Kalkol,” this is Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph provided [<i>vaykhalkel</i>]” (Genesis 47:12). The Egyptians said: ‘Is this slave not king over us due only to his wisdom?’ They took seventy notes<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Each note was written in a different language.</i> and cast them before him and he would read each of them in its language. Moreover, he would speak in the sacred tongue, which they did not know, with which they were not familiar, and which they could not understand. So, it says: “He established it as a precept for Joseph [when he went out over Egypt; I learned a language I had not known]” (Psalms 81:6). “And Darda,” (I Kings 5:11), this is the generation [<i>dor</i>] of the wilderness, which was entirely knowledge [<i>de’a</i>]. “Sons of Maḥol,” (I Kings 5:11), these are the Israelites, whom the Holy One blessed be He forgave [<i>maḥal</i>] for the sin of the [Golden] Calf.
“He spoke three thousand proverbs” (I Kings 5:12). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: We reviewed the Bible in its entirety, and we found that Solomon composed only approximately eight hundred verses [of proverbs], and you say three thousand? Rather, it teaches that each and every verse that Solomon composed has two or three meanings. The Rabbis say: On each and every verse there are three thousand parables, and there are one thousand and five meanings for each and every parable, as it is written: “And his poems [<i>shiro</i>] were [one thousand and five]” (I Kings 5:12), the remainder [<i>shiyuro</i>] for each parable<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">Layers of meaning that were not explicitly stated.</i> was one thousand and five.
“He spoke of the trees, [from the cedar which is in Lebanon to the hyssop that emerges from the wall; he spoke of the animal, of the bird, of the creeping creatures, and of the fish]” (I Kings 5:13). Is it possible for a person to speak of the trees? It is rather that Solomon said: ‘Why is the leper purified by the tallest of the tall and the lowest of the low, with a cedar tree and a hyssop? It is because when a person elevates himself like a cedar, he is afflicted with leprosy, and when he lowers himself and demeans himself like the hyssop, which is low, he will ultimately be healed.’<br>Likewise, why is it that an animal is permitted with two signs<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">When an animal is slaughtered, the knife must penetrate the majority of both the gullet and the windpipe.</i> and a bird is permitted with one sign?<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">When a bird is slaughtered, the knife must penetrate the majority of either the gullet or the windpipe.</i> It is because the animal is created from the dry land, and the bird from the sea, as bar Kappara said: The bird was created from the mud.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Mud is a combination of dry land and water. Thus, a bird’s status is between that of an animal, which was created from the earth, and a fish, created from water. Similarly, its slaughter requires the middle ground between that of an animal, which requires the penetration of two passageways, and that of a fish, which does not require ritual slaughter at all.</i> Rabbi Avin said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel Kapodkiya, that the legs of a chicken are similar to the scales of a fish.<br>“And of the creeping creatures,” he said: Why is one who traps or wounds [one of the] eight swarming creatures [mentioned] in the Torah on Shabbat liable,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Liable for desecrating the Shabbat, which carries with it the death penalty or <i>karet</i> for intentional violation, and a sin-offering for unwitting violation.</i> while for all the rest of the swarming creatures, repugnant creatures and creeping creatures, one is exempt? It is because they have skins. “And of the fish,” he said: Why is it that all animals, beasts, and birds require slaughter, and fish do not require slaughter? It is from this verse: “Will flocks and herds be slaughtered?” (Numbers 11:22), while regarding fish, only gathering is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">The entire verse states: “Will flocks and herds be slaughtered for them and suffice for them? If all the fish of the sea would be gathered for them, would it suffice for them?”</i><br>Yaakov, from the village of Nevurya, issued a ruling in Tyre that fish require slaughtering. Rabbi Ḥagai heard and he sent to bring him. [Rabbi Ḥagai] said to him: ‘From where did you [derive] your ruling?’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥagai]: ‘From here, as it is written: “Let the water swarm with swarms of the living and let birds fly” (Genesis 1:20). Just as a bird requires slaughter, so too, fish require slaughter.’ [Rabbi Ḥagai] said: ‘Let him be flogged forty times.’ [Yaakov] said: ‘Shall a person who states a matter from the Torah be flogged?’ [Rabbi Ḥagai] said to him: ‘You did not issue a correct ruling.’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥagai]: “From where [do you derive this]?’ [Rabbi Ḥagai] said to him: ‘From here: “Will flocks and herds be slaughtered for them [and suffice for them? If all the fish of the sea would be gathered for them, would it suffice for them?]” (Numbers 11:22) – these with slaughter and these with gathering.’ [Yaakov] said: ‘Flog your floggings, as it is good for internalization.’
Yaakov, from the village of Nevurya, issued a ruling in Tyre, that the son of a gentile woman is circumcised on Shabbat. Rabbi Ḥagai heard and he sent to bring him. [Rabbi Ḥagai] said to him: ‘From where did you [derive] your ruling?’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥagai]: ‘From here, as it is written: “They declared their lineage [<i>vayityaldu</i>] after their families” (Numbers 1:18), and it is written: “[He that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you…] he that is born [<i>yelid</i>] in the house and purchased with money [from any foreigner” (Genesis 17:12).’ [Rabbi Ḥagai] said: ‘Let him be flogged forty times.’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥagai]: ‘Shall a person who states a matter from the Torah be flogged?’ [Rabbi Ḥagai] said: ‘You did not issue a correct ruling.’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥagai]: ‘From where [do you derive this]?’ [Rabbi Ḥagai said:] ‘Bend over<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Bend over the flogging pole.</i> and listen.’ He [continued and] said to him: ‘If a son of gentiles comes to you and says: ‘I wish to become a Jew,’ provided that he will be circumcised on the day of Shabbat or on the day of Yom Kippur, does one desecrate Shabbat on his behalf or not? You must say: One does not desecrate, because one desecrates Shabbat and Yom Kippur only on behalf of the son of an Israelite man and an Israelite woman.’ He said to [Rabbi Ḥagai]: ‘From where [is this derived]?’ [Rabbi Ḥagai] said to him: ‘Bend over, [it is derived from the following verse:] “To send away all the wives and those born from them”’ (Ezra 10:3). He said to [Rabbi Ḥagai]: ‘Are you flogging me based on a verse in Writings?’ [Rabbi Ḥagai] said to him: ‘It is as it is written: “And let it be done in accordance with the Torah”’ (Ezra 10:3). He said to [Rabbi Ḥagai]: ‘From what [source in the] Torah?’ [Rabbi Ḥagai said:] ‘It is as it says: “You shall not marry them” (Deuteronomy 7:3). Why? “For they will cause your child to turn away” (Deuteronomy 7:4) – a son who emerges from an Israelite woman is called your son, but a son who emerges from a gentile woman or from a maidservant is not called your son, but rather, her son.’ He said to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Yaakov of Nevurya said this to Rabbi Ḥagai. Alternatively, Rabbi Ḥagai said this to the individual whose job it was to administer the flogging.</i> ‘Flog your floggings, as it is good for internalization.’<br>Solomon said: On all these I stood and examined, but the portion of the red heifer I analyzed. When I was toiling in it and expounding and investigating it: “I said: I will become wise, but it is far from me” (Ecclesiastes 7:23).

Chapter 26

<b>“I find more bitter than death, the woman whose heart is snares and nets, her hands, shackles. One who is good before God will escape from her, but a sinner will be captured by her” (Ecclesiastes 7:26).</b><br>“I find more bitter than death, the woman…” The Rabbis say: Because she demands from him things that he is unable to live up to, ultimately, she causes him to die a bitter death. There was an incident involving a certain person who had a neighbor who was a robber, who would go out and attack at night, and sustain his sons and daughters during the day. The wife of that person said to him: ‘How unfortunate is that woman who has adhered to you.’<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">She said this about herself.</i> She said to him: ‘Do you see the children of our neighbor, how they eat and drink?’<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">They are so much better off than we are.</i> He said to her: ‘Do you want me to do what he does?’ She said to him: ‘What is wrong with that?’ He said to her: ‘Come with me to convince him [to let] me go with him.’ They went and convinced him, and he took him with him. They went out that night, and another robber went out and set an ambush after them. This one,<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">The experienced robber.</i> who was familiar with the roads, fled and was spared, and that one,<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">The neighbor who went out to rob for the first time.</i> who was not familiar with the paths, was captured and hanged. They proclaimed in his regard: ‘Last of the robbers, first of the hanged.’
There are three matters that are harmful to the body: An affliction of the heart is harmful to the body; an affliction due to intestinal illness is more harmful to the body than affliction of the heart; and poverty is more harmful than any of them. Rabbi Yehuda said: There are fourteen things, one more powerful than the next, and each one dominates the next. The depths are powerful, but the earth dominates it because it is flattened over it. The earth is powerful, but the powerful mountains dominate it. The mountain is powerful, but iron dominates and shatters it. Iron is powerful, but fire melts it. Fire is powerful, but water dominates it and douses it. Water is powerful, but the clouds carry it. Clouds are powerful, but the wind scatters them. The wind is powerful, but the wall dominates and withstands it. A wall is powerful, but a person dominates and demolishes it. A person is powerful, but trouble frightens him. Trouble is powerful, but wine dominates and causes it to be forgotten. Wine is powerful, but sleep abates it. Sleep is powerful, but illness dominates and interrupts it. Illness is powerful, but the angel of death dominates it and takes his life. And an evil woman is more powerful than all of them.
“Whose [heart] is snares and nets” – as she traps in the sea and on dry land. “Her hands, shackles,” Rabbi Elazar said: Had he not written in her regard: “Her hands, shackles,” she would seize a man in the marketplace and say: ‘Have relations with me.’<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse to mean that the woman’s hands are shackled, meaning that she is too inhibited to demand relations outright. Instead, her “heart is snares and nets” – in her heart she desires relations, and she finds ways to entice men.</i> This is analogous to a biting dog whose owner holds it on a chain; even though it is tied, it would grasp onto a person in the marketplace by his clothes. So, had he not written in her regard: “Her hands, shackles,” she would abduct a person in the marketplace. See what is written: “She seized him by his garments, saying: Lie with me” (Genesis 39:12). “One who is good before God will escape from her” – this is Joseph; “but the sinner will be captured by her” – this is Potifar. Alternatively, “good” – this is Pinḥas, “but the sinner” – this is Zimri. Alternatively, “good” – this is Palti, “but the sinner” – this is Amnon.<br>Rabbi Isi of Caesarea interpreted the verse regarding heresy. “Good” – this is Rabbi Elazar, “but a sinner” – this is Yaakov of the village of Nevurya.<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">He was a heretic.</i> Alternatively, “good” – this is Elazar ben Dama, “but a sinner” – this is Yaakov of the village of Sama.<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kohelet Rabba</i> 1:8 for a story pertaining to Elazar ben Dama and Yaakov of Sikhanya, who some commentaries equate with the Yaakov of Sama mentioned here.

Chapter 27

<b>“See, this I have found, said Kohelet, adding one to another to find the account” (Ecclesiastes 7:27).</b><br>“See, this I have found, said [<i>amera</i>] Kohelet,” and elsewhere it says: “Said [<i>amar</i>] Kohelet” (Ecclesiastes 1:2; 12:8). Rabbi Yirmeya said: This is the Divine Spirit, which at times speaks in the masculine and at times speaks in the feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Amera</i> is a feminine term and <i>amar</i> is a masculine term.</i><br>“Adding one to another to find the account,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: According to the way of the world, if a person falters and commits a sin for which he is liable to receive death at the hand of Heaven, how does he gain atonement? His ox dies, his chicken is lost, his bowl breaks, he bumps his little finger and a drop of blood falls; part of the soul corresponds to the entire soul, as it is stated: “Adding one to another to find the account” – one combines with another one and the account is complete.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">All the small travails and sufferings together are punishment for his sin.</i> To what extent is the account exacted? Rabbi Pinḥas said: [One is punished] for every single [transgression].

Chapter 28

<b>“What my soul sought further, I did not find; one man from one thousand I have found; but a woman among all these I did not find” (Ecclesiastes 7:28).</b><br>“What my soul sought further, I did not find; one man from one thousand I have found.” According to the way of the world, one thousand people enter to study Bible, one hundred of them emerge to study Mishna, ten of them emerge to study Talmud, and one of them emerges to issue rulings; that is what is written: “One man from one thousand I have found.”<br>Another matter, “man” – this is Abraham, “but a woman among all these I did not find” – this is Sarah. Alternatively, “man” – this is Amram, “but a woman” – this is Yokheved. “Man” – this is Moses, “but a woman” – these are the women of the wilderness.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Although Sarah, Yokheved, and the Israelite women in the generation of Moses were righteous, they were not equal to the men with whom they are contrasted.</i> Alternatively, “man” – this is Moses, who came after one thousand generations; that is what is written: “He commanded the matter for one thousand generations” (Psalms 105:8). This teaches that the Holy One blessed be He looked at all the jugs and did not find a jug as lined with pitch as Moses, who extended his hand and received the Torah.

Chapter 29

<b>“But, see, this I have found: God made man upright, but they have sought many schemes” (Ecclesiastes 7:29).</b><br>“But, see, this I have found: God made man upright” – he was upright, as it is stated: “God made man upright,” and it is written: “Behold, man has become like one of us” (Genesis 3:22) – like one of the ministering angels. When they became two, “but they have sought many schemes.”

Parasha 8



Chapter 1

<b>“Who is like the wise man, and who knows the meaning of a matter? The wisdom of a man illuminates his face, and the boldness of his face is changed” (Ecclesiastes 8:1).</b><br>“Who is like the wise man” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, in whose regard it is written: “Wise of heart, mighty in strength” (Job 9:4). “And who knows the meaning of a matter” – for He explained the Torah to Moses. “The wisdom of a man illuminates his face” – Rabbi Shimon said: Great is the ability of the prophets, as they compare the [human] form to its maker,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">By portraying God in human terms.</i> as it is written: “I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai” (Daniel 8:16). Rabbi Yudan said: We have a verse that is clearer than that, as it is written: “And upon the likeness of the throne there was a likeness like the appearance of a man upon it, from above” (Ezekiel 1:26). “And the boldness of his face is changed” – He changes from the attribute of justice to the attribute of mercy regarding Israel.
Another matter, “who is like the wise man” – this is Adam the first man, as it is written in his regard: “You are the culmination of perfection” (Ezekiel 28:12). “And who knows the meaning of a matter” – who delineated names for all. “The wisdom of a man illuminates his face” – his beauty illuminates his face. Rabbi Levi said: The curve of the heel of Adam the first man outshone the sun. Do not be astonished, as it is the way of the world that when a person crafts for himself two excellent trays, one for him and one for a member of his household, whose will he craft more beautifully? Will it not be his? So too, Adam the first man was created for the service of the Holy One blessed be He, and the sun was created for the service of man. Is it not right that the curve of the heel of man will outshine the sun? This is so regarding the curve of his heel, all the more so regarding his face.<br>Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: The Holy One blessed be He tied thirteen canopies for them<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Adam and Eve.</i> in the Garden of Eden. That is what is written: “You were in Eden, the garden of God; [every precious stone was your canopy: ruby, topaz and clear quartz, beryl, onyx, and chalcedony, sapphire, carbuncle, emerald and gold]” (Ezekiel 28:13). Reish Lakish said: Eleven. The Rabbis say: Ten. They do not disagree.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">They do not disagree about the fact that the verse in Ezekiel, which lists ten precious stones, is the source of the number of canopies that God tied for Adam and Eve.</i> The one who said thirteen interpreted [the phrase] “every precious stone was your canopy,” as three [additional materials]. The one who said eleven interpreted it as one. The one who said ten did not interpret it as any. Yet, after all this praise, [God said to Adam:] “as you are dust” (Genesis 3:19). “And the boldness of his face is changed” – when the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Did you [eat] from the tree?” (Genesis 3:12),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">To which Adam responded by blaming God for giving him Eve, who had given him to eat from the tree.</i> the Holy One blessed be He, too, changed the glory of his countenance, and expelled him from the Garden of Eden.
Another matter, “who is like the wise man” – this is Israel, in whose regard it is written: “It is a particularly wise and understanding people” (Deuteronomy 4:6). “And who knows the meaning of a matter” – as they knew how to expound the Torah, forty-nine interpretations for ritual purity and a corresponding number for ritual impurity.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They could analyze from all angles a question regarding ritual purity, such that they could provide forty-nine rationales for each side of the argument.</i> You find that when the Israelites stood at Mount Sinai and said: “We will perform and we will hearken” (Exodus 24:7), the aura of the supernal Divine Presence was placed upon them. When they sinned,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">With the sin of the Golden Calf.</i> they became the enemies of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is written: “And the boldness of his face is changed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The word changed [<i>yeshuneh</i>] is interpreted here to mean hated [<i>yesuneh</i>].</i> The Holy One blessed be He, too, changed matters for them, as it is written: “Indeed, you will die like man” (Psalms 82:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">By contrast to the status they had before the sin: “I had said: You are divine, like celestial beings, all of you” (Psalms 82:6), but now they will die.</i>
Another matter, “who is like the wise man” – this is the Torah scholar. “And who knows the meaning of a matter” – as he knows how to interpret his learning.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He knows how to arrive at halakhic conclusions.</i> “The wisdom of a man [illuminates his face]” – when he is asked a question and responds; “and the boldness of his face is changed” – when he is asked a question and does not know how to respond.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya was sitting and teaching: From where is it derived that one cannot substitute for a firstborn?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A firstborn kosher animal has sanctity and must be given to a priest (see Deuteronomy 15:19–23). If one attempts to transfer the sanctity to a different animal, both animals are considered sacred. However, once the firstborn animal is given to the priest, if one attempts to transfer the sanctity to a different animal, the attempt is meaningless, and the second animal is not considered sacred. This is the teaching that Rabbi Ḥiyya was explicating.</i> The face of bar Pedaya glowed. [Rabbi Ḥiyya] said: This one knows what I am sitting and teaching.<br>A certain gentile saw Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai; he saw that his face glowed. He said: ‘This man is one of three things; either he is intoxicated with wine, lends with interest, or raises pigs.’ Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: ‘Let despair come upon that man, as I do not have even one of the three. I am not a lender with interest, as it is stated: “Do not lend to your brother with interest” (Deuteronomy 23:20). I am not a raiser of pigs, as it is prohibited for an Israelite to raise pigs, as it is taught there: It is prohibited for a person to raise pigs anywhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Bava Kama</i> 7:7.</i> And I am not intoxicated with wine, as even the four cups of wine that I drink on Passover eve cause my head to ache from Passover until <i>Shavuot</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Ilai did not like wine and would not drink it unless absolutely necessary.</i> [The gentile] said to him: ‘Why does your face glow?’ He said to him: ‘It is my Torah that causes my face to glow, as it is written: “The wisdom of a man illuminates his face…”’<br>Rabbi Abbahu went to Caesarea and he came from there and his face was glowing. His students saw him and ascended and told Rabbi Yoḥanan: ‘This Rabbi Abbahu found a treasure.’ He said to them: ‘Why [do you say so]?’ They said to him: ‘Because his face is glowing.’ He said to them: ‘Perhaps he heard some new Torah.’ They ascended to him and they said to him: ‘What new Torah did the Master hear?’ He said to them: ‘An ancient <i>Tosefta</i> was cited.’ They recited a verse in his regard: “The wisdom of a man…”
Another matter, “who is like the wise man” – this is Moses, in whose regard it is written: “A wise man ascended against the city of the mighty” (Proverbs 21:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is an allusion to Moses ascending <br>heavenward to the stronghold of the angels to receive the Torah.</i> “And who knows the meaning of a matter” – as he explained the Torah to Israel.

Chapter 2

<b>“I observe the king’s command, and the word of an oath to God” (Ecclesiastes 8:2).</b><br>“I observe the king’s command.” Rabbi Levi said: I will observe the word of the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, the mouth which said: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2); “and the word” – “you shall not have [another god before Me]” (Exodus 20:3); “of an oath” – “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 20:7).

Chapter 3

<b>“Do not be hasty to leave his presence; do not stand before him in an evil matter, as he does whatever pleases him” (Ecclesiastes 8:3).</b><br>“Do not be hasty to leave his presence.” Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda began: “My son, do not despise the admonition of the Lord” (Proverbs 3:11).

Rabbi Levi ben Panti read the curses before Rabbi Huna and he stammered in [reading] them. [Rabbi Huna] said to him: ‘Sound your voice, as these are not curses, these are rebukes; “do not despise the admonition of the Lord and do not loathe His rebuke.”’

Chapter 4

<b>“Since the king's word has power, and who will say to him: What are you doing” (Ecclesiastes 8:4).</b><br>“Since the king's word has power.” Rabbi Bon said: It is written: “Do not test [the Lord]” (Deuteronomy 6:16), “and God tested [Abraham]” (Genesis 22:1), “Do not take vengeance and do not bear a grudge” (Leviticus 19:18), “the Lord is a zealous and vengeful God” (Nahum 1:2).

But You take vengeance and bear a grudge.’ He said to them: ‘I will not bear a grudge against Israel, as it is written: “He will not contend to eternity or forever bear a grudge” (Psalms 103:9); however, for the nations of the world: “The Lord is vengeful to His foes and bears a grudge against His enemies” (Nahum 1:2). I dictated to you in My Torah: “Do not take vengeance and do not bear a grudge against the members of your people” (Leviticus 19:18), but you may take vengeance against the nations of the world, as it is stated: “Avenge the children of Israel [on the Midianites]” (Numbers 31:2),’ to realize what is written: “Since the king's word has power, [and who will say to him: What are you doing].”

Chapter 5

<b>“One who follows a command will not know an evil matter, and a wise man's heart will know the time of judgment” (Ecclesiastes 8:5).</b><br>“One who follows a command will not know an evil matter,” this is Esther, who was engaged in the mitzva of removing leavened bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">On the thirteenth of Nisan, although she was in the palace, she was unaware of Haman’s evil decree that had been issued that day, and she was engaged in preparing for Passover.</i> “And a wise man's heart will know the time of judgment,” this is Mordekhai, as it is written: “Mordekhai knew everything that had been done” (Esther 4:1).

Chapter 6

<b>“For every desire there is a time of judgment, as the evil of man overcomes him” (Ecclesiastes 8:6).</b><br>“For every desire there is a time,” and for every time there is a desire. How so? What a person desires to do in this world, he does, but there, [in the World to Come,] there is judgment and accounting.

Chapter 8

<b>“There is no man who rules the spirit to retain the spirit, and there is no rule over the day of death. There is no release in war, and wickedness will not rescue its owner” (Ecclesiastes 8:8).</b><br>“There is no man who rules the spirit.” The Rabbis say: “There is no man who rules the spirit” of the angel of death, to prevent him from taking him. From where is it derived that angels are called spirits? As it is stated: “He makes his angels spirits” (Psalms 104:4). “And there is no rule over the day of death,” a person cannot say to the angel of death: ‘Wait for me until I make my accounting, and then I will come.’ “There is no release in war,” a person cannot say: ‘My son, my servant, or a member of my household will take my place.’ “And wickedness will not rescue its owner” – one cannot commute his sentence and one cannot appeal his conviction.<br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: “There is no man who rules the spirit” – there is no prophet of Israel who controls the spirit of the Holy One blessed be He, to prevent Him from [conveying prophesy through] him, as it is stated: “I would say: I will not mention Him, [and I will not speak anymore in His name, but in my heart it would be as a burning fire]” (Jeremiah 20:9). “And there is no rule over the day of death,” [as it is written:] “Those who are to death, to death…” (Jeremiah 15:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The prophet cannot refrain from conveying his prophecy even if it is a prophecy of death and destruction.</i> “There is no release in war,” [as it is written:] “Send them from My presence and let them go” (Jeremiah 15:1). “And wickedness will not rescue its owner.” Rabbi Ḥagai in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The cynics of that generation were muttering with their mouths, pointing with their fingers, and were saying: “The vision that he is foretelling [is for many days to come]” (Ezekiel 12:27). The prophet said to them: “For it is in your days, defiant house” (Ezekiel 12:25).<br>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: There is no man who rules the spirit of the kingdoms, to prevent their [rule] over him. “And there is no rule over the day of death,” as it is stated: “Snares of death confronted me” (Psalms 18:6). “There is no release [<i>mishlaḥat</i>] in war,” as it is written: “A band [<i>mishlaḥat</i>] of destroying animals” (Psalms 78:49).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">One cannot escape the retribution of God by waging war against those He sends against Israel (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> “And wickedness will not rescue its owner” – but had they repented, they would have mitigated it.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Attempting to emulate the wicked nations will not spare them; repentance will.</i><br>The Rabbis say: There is no man who rules his own spirit to bring about its termination from him. Rabbi Ḥanina said: It is written: “And fashions [<i>veyotzer</i>] the spirit of man within him” (Zechariah 12:1) – [God] bound [<i>tzar</i>] the spirit of man within him, as were it not so, when trouble would come, he would take it and cast it from within him. Rabbi Levi said: Approximately fifty-two times “King David” is written; when he was close to death, it is written: “The days of David drew near to die” (I Kings 2:1) because “there is no rule over the day of death.” Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: The two trumpets that were [used] in the days of Moses were interred. One verse says: “They shall sound them…and they shall congregate to you” (Numbers 10:3), and one verse says: “Assemble to me all the elders of your tribe” (Deuteronomy 31:28); where were the trumpets?<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Moses asked the Levites to assemble the people for him instead of blowing the trumpets himself and thereby calling them to assembly.</i> Say that they had already been interred in the days of Moses.

Chapter 9

<b>“All this I have seen and taken to my heart, for every action that is performed beneath the sun, when man had authority over man, it was to his detriment” (Ecclesiastes 8:9).</b><br>“All this I have seen…when man had authority over man, it was to his detriment” – there are times when it is to the detriment of the ruler, and there are times when it is to the detriment of the ruled. Rabbi Elazar said: You have one incur liability by means of another only if he is a person of the same stature, as it is stated: “When man had authority [over man].”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The ruler persecutes another person, and is subsequently punished for his misdeeds.

The Rabbis derive it from this [verse]: “For is the tree of a field a man?” (Deuteronomy 20:19) – just as a man is destined to give an account and a reckoning, so too, non-fruit trees are destined to give an account and a reckoning.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Although the simple reading of the verse is that this phrase is a rhetorical question, it can also be translated as a statement: “For the tree of a field is a man.” Thus, the midrash views the verse as alluding to a similarity between a tree and a man.</i>

Chapter 10

<b>“So I saw the wicked buried and come; they would go from a holy place, but would be forgotten in the city where they acted like that; this, too, is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 8:10).</b><br>“So I saw the wicked buried and come.”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets this as referring to someone wicked who died and came back to life.</i> Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: If it is regarding the dead of Ezekiel<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See Ezekiel chap. 37.</i> that the verse is speaking, but is it not already stated “the wicked,” and they were nothing other than righteous?

But he did not come [fully back to life]; rather, “It was as they were burying a man…and he came to life” (II Kings 13:21) – could it be that it was forever? The verse states: “He stood on his feet” (II Kings 13:21) – this teaches that his standing was only temporary, merely to separate him from that righteous one. What is “and come [<i>vava’u</i>]”? Rabbi Shmuel said: Their sun set and they were purified; this is as it is stated: “The sun will set [<i>uva</i>] and he will be purified” (Leviticus 22:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shmuel interprets the verse as referring not to the dead who come alive, but to those who are ritually impure and then become pure.</i> Rabbi Levi said: “All the days of the wicked, he trembles [<i>mitḥolel</i>]” (Job 15:20) – he is dead [<i>met</i>] and a corpse [<i>veḥalal</i>], just as you say: “You are a wicked corpse [<i>ḥalal</i>]” (Ezekiel 21:30).<br>Another matter, it is referring to proselytes who come and repent. “They would go from a holy place” – because they went to a holy place, these are the synagogues and study hall. “But would be forgotten in the city” – their wicked deeds will be forgotten. “Where they acted like that” – and the good deeds that they performed in the city will be found. “This, too, is vanity.” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is not vanity, but it is vanity that they do not come on their own. Rabbi Bon said: The righteous went there and then they came, e.g., Joseph to Asenat, Joshua to Raḥav, Boaz to Ruth, and Moses to Ḥovav.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">In each case a gentile became a righteous convert, but only through direct contact with a righteous individual.</i> Rabbi Aḥa said: It is vanity only that the people do not come and sanctify themselves under the wings of the Divine Presence.

Chapter 11

<b>“Because a sentence for an evil deed is not executed swiftly, therefore the heart of the sons of man dares to do evil” (Ecclesiastes 8:11).</b><br>“Because a sentence…is not executed” – because a person sins and the attribute of justice does not afflict him, “therefore [the heart of the sons of man] dares” – what do they say?

<b>“I praised joy, as there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat, drink, and rejoice.

Rabbi Yona said: The paradigm for all of them is as it is stated: “[There is nothing better…than to eat, drink, and rejoice]. That will accompany him in his toil [<i>ba’amalo</i>]” (Ecclesiastes 8:15) – in his world [<i>beolamo</i>], in this world. “During the days of his life” – to the grave. Is there food and drink in the grave, that it accompanies a person to his grave? Rather, these are Torah, and the good deeds that a person performs.

<b>“For the living know that they will die; but the dead do not know anything, and they no longer have a reward, as their memory is forgotten” (Ecclesiastes 9:5).</b><br>“For the living know that they will die.” Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Yonatan were walking before the bier of Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakoneya, and Rabbi Yonatan’s garment<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">With its ritual fringes.</i> was dragging on the coffin. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said to him: ‘My son, lift your garment, so they will not say: Tomorrow they are coming to us, and they are mocking us.’<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The dead should not perceive Rabbi Yonatan as mocking them by allowing his ritual fringes to drape on the bier, while the dead are unable to perform mitzvot.</i> He said to him: ‘Rabbi, is it not written: “But the dead do not know anything”?’ He said to him: ‘My son, Bible, you know; Midrash, you do not know. “For the living know” – these are the righteous, who, even in their death, are called alive. “But the dead do not know anything” – these are the wicked, who, even in their lifetimes, are called dead.<br>‘From where is it derived that the righteous, even in their death, are called alive? It is as it is stated: “To the land in whose regard I took an oath to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob, saying: [I will give it to your descendants]” (Exodus 33:1). He did not say: To the patriarchs, but rather, “to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” He said to Moses: Go out and say to them: The oath that I took to them, I have fulfilled, as it is stated: “I will give it to your descendants.” The wicked, even in their lifetimes, are called dead, as it is written: “For I do not desire the death of the dead” (Ezekiel 18:32). Do the dead die? Rather, these are the wicked who, even in their lifetimes, are called dead.’ [Rabbi Yonatan] said to [Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great]: ‘Blessed is he who taught me Midrash.’ [Rabbi Ḥiyya] kissed him on his head.

Chapter 6

<b>“Even their love, even their hatred and even their envy, have already perished; they will never again have a portion in anything that is done under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 9:6).</b><br>“Even their love” – that they had for their idolatry more than for the Holy One blessed be He; “even their hatred” – that they had for the Holy One blessed be He [and they expressed] through their actions; “even their envy [<i>kinatan</i>]” – that they infuriated Him [<i>kinuhu</i>] with their idol worship, as it is stated: “They would infuriate Him with strange gods” (Deuteronomy 32:16). They no longer have a portion in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The World to Come.</i> But Israel has a portion and an excellent reward, as it is stated: “Go eat your bread joyfully” (Ecclesiastes 9:7).

Chapter 7

<b>“Go, eat your bread joyfully, and drink your wine goodheartedly, as God has already accepted your actions” (Ecclesiastes 9:7).</b><br>“Go, eat your bread joyfully.” Rabbi Huna son of Rabbi Aḥa said: When the children take their leave from school,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">To go home and eat their lunch.</i> a Divine Voice emerges and says to them: “Go, eat your bread joyfully,” – your breath<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The words of Torah you have expressed.</i> has been accepted before Me as a pleasing aroma. When Jews take their leave of synagogues and study halls, a Divine Voice emerges and says to them: “Go, eat your bread joyfully” – your prayer has been accepted before Me as a pleasing aroma.<br>Another matter, “go, eat your bread joyfully” – this is the Torah portion of <i>ḥalla</i>; “and drink your wine goodheartedly” – this is the Torah portion of libations; “as God has already accepted your actions” – this is the entry of the Israelites into the Land, as it is stated: “When you come to the Land” (Numbers 15:2).<br>Rabbi Azarya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon interpreted the verse as regarding Abraham our patriarch. When the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Take now your son, your only one […and offer him up there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will tell you]” (Genesis 22:2), on the first day, he did not see anything, nor on the second. On the third day, this is what is written in its regard: “He saw the place from afar” (Genesis 22:4). What did he see? He saw a cloud affixed to the mountain. He said: It appears that this is the mountain upon which the Holy One blessed be He said to me to bring up my son Isaac. He said to him: ‘Isaac, my son, do you see what I see?’ [Isaac] said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to [Isaac]: ‘What do you see?’ [Isaac] said to him: ‘A cloud affixed to the mountain.’ He said to Eliezer and Ishmael, his lads: ‘Do you see anything?’ They said: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Since you do not see anything and the donkey does not see anything, “stay here with the donkey [<i>im haḥamor</i>]” (Genesis 22:5) – a people comparable to a donkey [<i>am domin laḥamor</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The slaves and children of maidservants are lowly, and in that sense comparable to the donkey.</i> Then he took Isaac and took him up mountains, took him down hills, and took him up to the peak of a particularly high and steep mountain. He built an altar, arranged the arrangement of wood, bound him upon it, and took the knife to slaughter him. Had the angel not come and said to him: “Do not extend your hand to the lad” (Genesis 22:12), he would have already slaughtered him.<br>When [Isaac] came to his mother, she said to him: ‘Where were you, my son?’ He said to her: ‘Father took me, and took me up mountains, took me down hills, and took me up to a certain mountain. He built an altar, arranged the arrangement of wood, bound me upon it, and took the knife to slaughter me. Had the angel not come and said to him: “Abraham, Abraham, do not extend your hand to the lad,” I would have already been slaughtered.’ When Sarah heard this, she screamed, and did not manage to complete her cry until her soul departed, as it is written: “Abraham came to eulogize Sarah and to weep for her” (Genesis 23:2). From where did he come? He came from Mount Moriah. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Abraham was ruminating in his heart: Perhaps there was a defect in my son and he was not accepted.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">He was deemed unfit to be sacrificed as an offering.</i> A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: ‘Abraham, Abraham, “go, eat your bread joyfully…as God has already accepted your actions,” God has accepted your offering.’<br>Rabbi Mona of Shaab and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi interpreted the verse as regarding Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur. This is analogous to a province that owed taxes to the king. The king dispatched a tax collector from the treasury to collect it. [When he was] at a distance of ten <i>mil</i>, the prominent leaders of the province emerged and lauded him, and he forgave one-third for them. At a distance of five <i>mil</i>, the middling ones emerged and lauded him, and he forgave one-third for them. When he neared [and was right outside the province], men, women, and children emerged to greet him, and he forgave it in its entirety. He said, ‘What is past is past, from here onward is a new account.’ So too, on the day before Rosh HaShana, the prominent leaders of the generation fast and the Holy One blessed be He absolves them of one-third of their transgressions, as it is stated: “Yet forgiveness is with You, so You will be feared” (Psalms 130:4). Rabbi Aḥa said: Forgiveness is primed for you from Rosh HaShana, “so You will be feared” – so Your fear will be on Your creations. Those days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, individuals fast, and the Holy One blessed be He absolves them of another third of their transgressions. On Yom Kippur, all of them fast, and the Holy One blessed be He absolves them of another third of their transgressions. When men, women, and children fast, the Holy One blessed be He forgives them for everything and says: ‘What is past is past, and the new account is from here onward.’ A Divine Voice emerges and says to them: “Go, eat your bread joyfully” – your prayer has already been heard.<br>Abba Taḥana the Pious was entering his city on Shabbat eve at [just before] nightfall, and his bundle was on his shoulder. He found a particular [individual] afflicted with boils lying at a crossroads. [The man] said to him: ‘Rabbi, perform for me a charitable act and bring me into the city.’ [Abba Taḥana] said: If I put down my bundle, how will I and my family earn a living? But if I abandon the man afflicted with boils, I deserve to lose my life. What did he do? He had the good inclination overcome the evil inclination and he took the man afflicted with boils into the city, and [then] came and took his bundle and entered with the light of the [setting] sun. Everyone was astonished and saying: Is this Abba Taḥana the Pious? He, too, ruminated in his heart and said: Would you say that I desecrated Shabbat? At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He caused the sun to shine, as it is written: “The sun of righteousness will shine for you, who fear My name” (Malachi 3:20). At that moment, he ruminated in his heart and said: Would you say that I will not receive reward?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He was concerned that the miracle was reward for his good deed and he would not receive reward in the World to Come.</i> A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Go, eat your bread joyfully, and drink your wine goodheartedly, as God has already accepted your actions.” You will receive your reward.<br>Another matter, [the verse] “go, eat your bread joyfully,” is speaking of Daniel, the beloved man, as it is stated: “I was still speaking in prayer, and the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the previous vision, was flying swiftly [<i>mu’af bi’af</i>]” (Daniel 9:21); he flew and flew again. “He explained and spoke with me” (Daniel 9:22). Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Daniel, the beloved man, said: The Holy One blessed be He knows that I finished my prayer and He sent an angel<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Gabriel.</i> and spoke with me, as it is stated: “He explained and spoke with me.” What did he say to me? He said to me: At the beginning of your supplications a word went forth” (Daniel 9:23). He said to me: I issued a decree that the Temple will be rebuilt. I said your request will be fulfilled at the beginning of your supplications, [but did not tell you until now] “because you are beloved,” (Daniel 9:23), for He desired his prayer.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">God desired Daniel’s prayers.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Onya [said] in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Beloved is written here three times, “beloved” (Daniel 9:23), “beloved” (Daniel 10:11), “beloved” (Daniel 10:19). [Gabriel] said to him: You are very beloved. You are beloved to your Creator, you are beloved to His entourage, and you are beloved to His Torah, as it is written: “For from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to fast before your God, your words have been heard” (Daniel 10:12), your prayer has been heard. A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: “Go, eat your bread joyfully” – your prayer has already been heard.

Chapter 8

<b>“May your garments be white at all times, and may the oil on your head not be lacking” (Ecclesiastes 9:8).</b><br>“May your garments be white at all times, and may the oil on your head not be lacking.” If the verse is referring to white garments, how many white garments are there among the nations of the world? And if the verse is referring to oils, how many oils are there among the nations of the world? It is referring only to mitzvot, good deeds, and Torah. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi stated a parable; to what is this matter analogous? It is to a king who made a feast and invited guests. He said to them: ‘Go bathe and anoint [yourselves], press and launder your garments, and prepare yourselves for the feast.’ But he did not set a time for them when they should come to the feast. The clever among them strolled at the entrance to the king’s palace. They said: ‘Does the king’s palace lack anything?’<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Everything can be prepared immediately.</i> The fools among them paid no heed and were not scrupulous regarding the king’s instructions. They said: ‘Ultimately, we will sense when the king’s feast begins. Is there any feast that does not require preparation and [arranging] seating [for the guests] next to each other?’ The plasterer went to his plaster, the potter to his mortar, the blacksmith to his coal, the launderer to his laundry room. Suddenly, the king said: ‘Everyone to the feast.’ They hurried them.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The king’s messengers rushed the guests to the feast (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> These came in their glory, and those came in their repulsiveness. The king was pleased with those who were clever, who fulfilled the king’s instructions, and moreover, they brought honor to the king’s palace, but he was angry at the fools who did not fulfill the king’s instructions, and disrespected the king’s palace. The king said: ‘Let those who prepared themselves for the feast come and partake in the king’s feast, and those who did not prepare themselves for the feast will not partake of the king’s feast.’ One might [think] they would take their leave, [but] the king then said: ‘No, but rather these shall recline, eat, and drink, and those shall stand on their feet, be punished, observe, and suffer.’ So it will be in the future;<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Those who prepare themselves during their lifetimes will enjoy the benefits of the World to Come, and those who do not, will suffer and wish they had used their lives well.</i> this is what Isaiah said: “Behold, My servants will eat and you will starve; [behold, My servants will drink and you will thirst; behold, My servants will rejoice and you will be ashamed]” (Isaiah 65:13).<br>Zivetai said in the name of Rabbi Meir: These recline, eat, and drink, and those recline, but do not eat and drink. There is no comparing the suffering of one who stands to the suffering of one who reclines. One who stands and does not eat and does not drink is like a waiter; one who reclines but does not eat, his suffering is exponentially greater and his face turns sallow. This is what the prophet says: “You will return and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked” (Malachi 3:18).<br>Bar Kappara and Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Kappara said: [This is analogous] to the wife of a royal courier who would adorn herself before her neighbors. Her neighbors said to her: ‘Your husband is not here, before whom are you adorning yourself?’ She said to them: ‘My husband is a sailor. If a favorable breeze will happen his way, he will come and will be standing over my head. Is it not preferable that he see me in my glory, and not in my repulsiveness?’ So too, “may your garments be white at all times” from transgressions, “and may the oil on your head not be lacking,” from mitzvot and good deeds. It is taught: Repent one day before your death (<i>Avot</i> 2:10). His students asked Rabbi Eliezer, they said to him: ‘Rabbi, does a person know when he will die in order to repent?’ He said to them: ‘All the more so, let him repent today, as perhaps, he will die tomorrow. The result is that all his days he is engaged in repentance.’ That is why it is stated: “May your garments be white at all times.”

Chapter 9

<b>“Enjoy life with a woman whom you love all the days of your life of vanity which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity, as that is your portion in life, and in your toil that you toil under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 9:9).</b><br>“Enjoy life with a woman whom you love.” Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said in the name of the holy congregation: Acquire for yourself a craft with Torah. What is the reason? “Enjoy life [with a woman]…”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is interpreting the world “life” to refer to Torah, and the term “woman” to refer to a craft. One should have a craft with which to earn a livelihood, in addition to studying Torah.</i> Why does he call them the holy congregation? It is because Rabbi Yosei ben Meshulam and Rabbi Shimon ben Menaseya, who would divide the day into three, one-third for Torah, one-third for prayer, and one-third for labor, were there. Some say: They would engage in Torah study during the days of winter, and in labor during the days of summer. Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar would call Rabbi Yehoshua son of Rabbi Timi and Rabbi Burki the holy congregation, because they would divide the day into three, one-third for Torah, one-third for prayer, and one-third for labor.<br>It is taught: It is prohibited for a mourner to marry a woman until thirty days [pass]. Rabbi Yehuda says: Until three consecutive pilgrimage festivals pass, corresponding to the three times that it is written: Life, life, life. In what case is this said? In a case when he has sons; however, if he has no sons, or if he has minor sons, it is permitted due to diminution of procreation and to see to their needs.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The mourner can marry a woman even within thirty days in order to fulfill the mitzva of procreation, or so that his new wife can take care of his young children.</i> There was an incident and the wife of Rabbi Tarfon died, and when the grave was covered, he said to her sister amidst the mourning: ‘Enter my house<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Marry me.</i> and raise your sister’s children.’ Even though he married her, he did not engage in conjugal relations until after thirty days. It is taught: It is prohibited for a mourner to go to a house of feasting until thirty days [have passed].<br>It was taught: The mitzvot incumbent upon a father regarding his son are to circumcise him and to redeem him, and also to teach him Torah, to teach him a trade, and to marry him to a woman. Some say: Also to teach him to swim in a river. To circumcise him, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “He that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male” (Genesis 17:12). To redeem him, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “And all the first-born of man among your sons you shall redeem” (Exodus 13:13). To teach him Torah, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “You shall teach them” (Deuteronomy 11:19). To marry a woman, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “Take women and beget sons and daughters and take women for your sons” (Jeremiah 29:6). To teach him to swim in a river, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “You shall choose life” (Deuteronomy 30:19).<br>Anyone who does not have a wife is without goodness, without a helper, without joy, without blessing, without atonement. Without good, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “It is not good for man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18). Without help, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “I will make him a helper alongside him” (Genesis 2:18). Without joy, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “You shall rejoice, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 14:26). Without blessing, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “To place a blessing upon your house” (Ezekiel 44:30). Without atonement, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “And he shall atone for himself and for his household” (Leviticus 16:11). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Without life as well, as it is stated: “Enjoy life with a woman whom you love.” Without peace, as it is stated: “You are peace and your house is peace” (I Samuel 25:6). Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said: He is not even a complete person, as it is stated: “He blessed them and He called their name Adam”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>adam</i>, which is the name of the first man, simply means “person.”</i> (Genesis 5:2) – when the two of them are not as one they are not called Adam. Some say it diminishes the Divine Image, as it is stated: “Because He created man in the image of God” (Genesis 9:6).

<b>“I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, and the war is not to the valiant; also bread is not to the wise, and also wealth is not to the clever, and also favor is not to the knowledgeable, but rather, time and chance befalls them all” (Ecclesiastes 9:11).</b><br>“That the race is not to the swift” – this is Jacob our patriarch; yesterday: “Jacob lifted his feet [and went to the land of the children of the east]” (Genesis 29:1), and today it is written: “He gathered his feet onto the bed [and expired]” (Genesis 49:33). “And the war is not to the valiant” – this is Jacob; yesterday, “he rolled the stone off the mouth of the well” (Genesis 29:10), and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Like a person removing the stopper from the mouth of a flask,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">This demonstrates Jacob’s great strength, as the stone was heavy enough that generally multiple people had to lift it together (see Genesis 29:8).</i> and today, “the sons of Israel transported Jacob their father” (Genesis 46:5), his body, and he could not be carried even [sitting] in a litter.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob was so weak that his sons had to carry him themselves as they traveled.</i><br>“Also bread is not to the wise” – this is Jacob; yesterday, “Jacob sacrificed an offering on the mountain…[and called his brethren to eat bread] and they ate bread” (Genesis 31:54). Were they his brethren? He had one brother, and if only he had buried him.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">His only brother, Esau, wanted to kill him; it would have been better for Jacob had Esau died.</i> Were they not his sons? Rather, once they reached his shoulders he likened them to himself and called them brethren. Today, “Return and purchase a little food for us…” (Genesis 43:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob asked his sons to return to Egypt to purchase food. Instead of him providing for them, he asked them to provide food for him.</i><br>“And also wealth is not to the clever” – this is Jacob; “the man became exceedingly prosperous [<i>vayifrotz</i>]” (Genesis 30:43). Rabbi Simon teaches in the name of Rabbi Shimon that he had a microcosm of the World to Come, as it is stated: “The one who breaks through [<i>haporetz</i>] will have ascended before them” (Micah 2:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the Messiah, the subject of that verse, will break the laws of nature, God broke the laws of nature in causing Jacob’s flocks to multiply in order to grant him wealth.</i> But today, “Joseph sustained his father and his brothers…” (Genesis 47:12).<br>“And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Jacob. Yesterday, “I know my son, I know” (Genesis 48:19). I know about the incident of Judah and Tamar, the incident of Reuben and Bilha. If the matters that were not revealed to you, were revealed to me, the matters that were revealed to you, all the more so. But today, he said to him: “If I have found favor in your eyes…do not bury me in Egypt (Genesis 47:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob was more knowledgeable than Joseph, as indicated in Genesis 48:19, yet he had to ask for Joseph’s favor so that he could be buried in the land of Israel.</i><br>Another matter, “the race is not to the swift” – this is Asael, as it is stated: “Asael was light on his feet, like one of the antelopes…” (II Samuel 2:18). How was his lightness manifest? He would run over the awns of the stalks and they would not break. Yesterday, “Asael was light on his feet,” and today, “Avner struck him with the back of the spear” (II Samuel 2:23).<br>“And the war is not to the valiant” – this is Avner, as it is written: “Are you not a man? Who is your equal in Israel…” (I Samuel 26:15). As Rabbi Asi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is easier for a person to move a six-cubit-wide wall than one of Avner’s legs; but today, “shall Avner die the death of a scoundrel?” (II Samuel 3:33).<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">David said this after Yoav tricked Avner and killed him.</i><br>“Also bread is not to the wise” – this is Solomon. Yesterday, “Solomon’s daily provision was thirty <i>kor</i> of fine flour and sixty <i>kor</i> of flour” (I Kings 5:2), and it is written: “Ten fattened bulls…” (I Kings 5:3). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Likewise, each and every day, and likewise each and every one of his wives would prepare a meal for him, under the impression that he would dine with her. But today, “this was my portion from all my toil” (Ecclesiastes 2:10). There is one who says: [All he had was] his bowl, there is one who says: [All he had was] his walking stick, and there is one who says: [All he had was] his belt.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">This is an allusion to the midrash (<i>Kohelet Rabba</i> 2:10) that Solomon was displaced from his throne and made to wander as a commoner with almost nothing.</i><br>“And also wealth is not to the clever” – this is Job. Yesterday, “his livestock was seven thousand sheep…” (Job 1:3), “and his livestock spread [<i>paratz</i>] in the land” (Job 1:10). Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: He breached [<i>paratz</i>] the boundaries of the world. Everywhere, the way of the world is that wolves kill the goats; however, with Job, the goats would kill the wolves. But today, “pity me, pity me, you are my friends…” (Job 19:21).<br>“And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Joshua. Rabbi Aḥva son of Rabbi Zeira said: There are two matters that Joshua spoke before Moses, but they did not find favor in his eyes, and these are: One regarding the appointment of the elders, and one in the incident of the [Golden] Calf. In the appointment of the elders, as it is written: “My lord Moses, incarcerate them [<i>kela’em</i>]” (Numbers 11:28); he said to him: Put an end to them [<i>kalem</i>] and remove them from the world. “Moses said to him: Are you zealous on my behalf?” (Numbers 11:29). [Moses] said to him: ‘Joshua, am I jealous of you?<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">According to rabbinic tradition, Joshua’s statement to Moses about two elders, Eldad and Medad, was made after the latter prophesied that Moses would die and Joshua would lead the nation in the land of Israel (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 17a). That is the backdrop of this midrash, in which Joshua demanded that these elders be punished for their lack of respect toward Moses, and Moses responded that he was not insulted by their prophecy (Rabbi David Luria).</i> If only my son could be like you, if only all Israel could be like you, “would that all the people of the Lord would be prophets” (Numbers 11:29).’<br>And one regarding the [Golden] Calf, as it is stated: “Joshua heard the sound of the people in their uproar [and he said to Moses: There is a sound of war in the camp]” (Exodus 32:17). Moses said to him: ‘A person who is destined to assert authority over six hundred thousand [men] does not know to distinguish between one sound and another sound? “It is not the sound of a cry of strength [<i>gevura</i>]” (Exodus 32:18),’ as it is stated: “Israel prevailed [<i>vegavar</i>]” (Exodus 17:11); ‘“and it is not the sound of a cry of weakness” (Exodus 32:18),’ as it is stated: “Joshua weakened [Amalek]” (Exodus 17:13); ‘“the sound of a cry, I hear” (Exodus 32:18).’ Rabbi Asi said: It is the sound of praise of idol worship, I hear. Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Asi: You do not have any generation that did not take one ounce of the calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment for this sin is distributed over all the generations.</i>
Another matter, “that the race is not to the swift” – this is Moses; yesterday he flew to the sky and ascended like a bird, as it is stated: “Moses ascended to God” (Exodus 19:3), but today, “as you will not be crossing this Jordan” (Deuteronomy 3:27); he was not allowed to cross even a tract of fifty cubits.<br>“And the war is not to the valiant” – this is Moses. Yesterday, “The kings of hosts flee again and again” (Psalms 68:13). What is “again and again”? They flee on the way there, and flee on the way back.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">At the giving of the Torah, the angels flew back and forth in fear while Moses stood calmly on the mountain.</i> Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: Ministering angels is not written here, but rather kings of hosts; even the kings of the angels, Mikhael and Gavriel, were afraid of Moses. Now, he is unable to look at even the weakest soldiers; that is what is written: “For I was terrified due to the wrath and the fury” (Deuteronomy 9:19).<br>“Also bread is not to the wise” – this is Moses. Yesterday, he became a minister and an official in Pharaoh’s palace, as it is stated: “Moses was grown up, and he went out to his brethren” (Exodus 2:11). What is [the meaning of the statement that Moses] “was grown up”? It was that his greatness was to bring in and to take out.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">He was in charge of providing food for Pharaoh’s household.</i> But today, “call him and let him eat bread” (Exodus 2:20).<br>“And also wealth is not to the clever” – this is Moses. From where did the wealth come to him, such that he became wealthy? Rabbi Ḥanin said: The Holy One blessed be He revealed to him a sapphire quarry inside his tent and he found it. It is from there that Moses became wealthy, as it is stated: “Carve for yourself [<i>pesol lekha</i>]” (Exodus 34:1); its residue [<i>pesilatan</i>] shall be for you. But today, none of that wealth remains.<br>“And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Moses. Yesterday, “as you have found favor in my eyes” (Exodus 33:17), and today, “do not continue to speak to Me anymore about this matter” (Deuteronomy 3:26).<br>“But rather, time and chance [<i>vafega</i>] befalls them all.” It is time that harms the person and undermines him in all these matters, and he is injured [<i>mafgia</i>]. What shall he do? He shall go and engage in prayer and supplication, and he will be saved. Rav Huna asked Shmuel, he said to him: ‘What is this that is written: “But rather time and chance [<i>vafega</i>]”?’ [Shmuel] said to him: ‘At times a person entreats in prayer and is answered, at times he entreats and is not answered, as you have no one who arranged prayers and supplications more than Moses our master, and ultimately it was stated to him: “Behold, your days to die are approaching” (Deuteronomy 31:14).’<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Moses prayed many times, and intensely, that he be permitted to enter the land of Israel, yet he died without being allowed to do so.</i>

Chapter 12

<b>“For man too does not know his time; like fish that are caught in an evil trap, and like birds that are caught in the snare, so the sons of man are snared at an evil time, when it falls upon them suddenly” (Ecclesiastes 9:12).</b><br>“For man too does not know his time; like fish that are caught in an evil trap” – Rabbi Berekhya said: Is there an evil trap and a good trap? Reish Lakish said: This is a fish hook. That is what is written: “The people who spread the evil slander about the Land died [in the plague]” (Numbers 14:37). With what were they killed? The Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai, the Rabbis said: Diphtheria rose in their throats and they choked and died. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: They died of their limbs falling off.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">This was the result of leprosy, one of the punishments for slander.</i> Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said the reason of the Rabbis: “Evil trap” is stated here, and “evil” is written there; just as in the “evil” written here, the fish hook goes down into the throat of the fish and chokes it, so, too, the “evil” that is written there means that diphtheria rose in their throats and they died. Rabbi Berekhya said the reason of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: “Plague” is stated here, and plague is stated there: “This will be the plague” (Zechariah 14:12). Just as the plague stated there is with the falling off of limbs, so, too, the plague stated here is with the falling off of limbs.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: You have a trap that traps in the sea and does not trap on dry land, [and there is a trap that] traps on dry land and does not trap in the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Yet, the term “evil trap” implies that it is effective both on land and at sea (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> Rather, this a hook that traps in the sea and traps on dry land, as it goes down into the throat of the fish and chokes it.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">It can also be used with bait on dry land to trap birds and animals.</i> Rabbi Azarya and Rabbi Yonatan ben Rabbi Ḥagai [said] in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon, in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: You have a [type of] person who sins on earth but does not sin in Heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">He sins in the area of interpersonal relations but not in ritual matters.</i> [and there is a type of person who sins] in Heaven but does not sin on earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">He sins toward God, in ritual matters, but does not sin in the areas of interpersonal relations.</i> However, one who speaks evil speech sins in Heaven and on earth, as it is stated: “They set their mouth against Heaven; their tongue walks across the land” (Psalms 73:9). Rabbi Elazar said: We find that they walk in Heaven,<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">They boast as though the walk in Heaven.</i> but their tongue walks on the earth. What is the reason that “they set their mouth against Heaven?” [It is because] “their tongue walks across the land.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A person speaks evil speech only after he denies the fundamental belief in God, as it is stated: “Who have said: With our tongue we will prevail; our lips are our own. [Who is master over us?]” (Psalms 12:5). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “Ponder this well, you who have forgotten God” (Psalms 50:22) – these are they who speak evil speech, as it is stated: “Who have said: With our tongue we will prevail; our lips are our own. [Who is master over us?]” (Psalms 12:5).

Chapter 13

<b>“This, too, I have seen as wisdom under the sun; and it is great to me” (Ecclesiastes 9:13).</b><br>“This, too, I have seen as wisdom under the sun…” Rabbi Shmuel bar Imi said: This is the thinking of the deceitful in their deceit, such as one who mixes water into wine, glaucium oil into [olive] oil, spring water into honey, donkey milk into balsam oil, sap into myrrh, vine leaves into pepper.

If I discuss them, I am teaching the swindlers [new techniques for swindling]. If I do not discuss [them], I am withholding knowledge and causing that which is ritually pure to become impure.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">If people do not know that these objects are susceptible to impurity, they will not know when they become impure, and will continue using them in that state, and could render impure other items which are ritually pure.</i> Alternatively, [I should discuss them] so the swindlers will not think that the Sages are not well-versed in their actions. Rabbi Shmuel said: Nevertheless,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the potential dangers.</i> “For the ways of the Lord are upright; the righteous will follow them and sinners will falter in them” (Hosea 14:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">This teaches that the truth must be stated, even if it will cause sinners to commit more transgressions.</i>

Chapter 15

<b>“He found in it a poor, wise man, and he saved the city in his wisdom; but no one remembered that poor man” (Ecclesiastes 9:15).</b><br>“He found in it a poor, wise man, – this is Noah, as it is stated: “For I have seen you righteous before Me in this generation” (Genesis 7:1). “And he saved the city in his wisdom” – as he would say to them: ‘Alas, empty ones, the flood is coming tomorrow; repent!’ <sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Noah said to the people of his generation, attempting to save them.</i> They would say to him: ‘If calamity will begin, it will begin from the house of that man.’<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Noah.</i> When Methuselah died they said to him: ‘Is it not from the house of that man that the calamity began?’<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Methuselah, a righteous man, died just seven days before the beginning of the Flood.

Another matter, “There was a small city” – this is Egypt, “and few men in it” – these are the Egyptians, “and a great king came against it and surrounded it” – this is the wicked Pharaoh,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh was a wicked king who did not act in the best interest of his subjects.</i> “and built a great siege upon it” – with ambush and subterfuge. “He found in it a poor, wise man” – this is Joseph the righteous, “and he saved the city in his wisdom” – as he said to Pharaoh: “Let Pharaoh proceed and let him appoint officials over the land…and let them gather all the food of these good years…” (Genesis 41:34). “But no one remembered that poor man” – the Holy One blessed be He said: You did not remember him; I remember him, as it is stated: “Joseph was the ruler over the land” (Genesis 42:6).
Another matter, “there was a small city” – this is Egypt, “and few men in it” – these are Joseph’s brothers, “and a great king came against it and surrounded it” – this is Joseph, “and built a great siege upon it” – these are the three edicts that he issued: That no slave shall enter Egypt, no person may enter with two donkeys, and no person may enter whose name and his father’s name, and his grandfather’s name, and his grandmother’s name are not documented.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph issued these edicts so that his brothers would have to come to Egypt themselves to procure food, and not send their slaves; so that they would all have to come, instead of sending just some of them; and so that he would be able to identify them (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> “He found in it a poor, wise man” – this is Judah, “and he saved the city in his wisdom” – as he said: “I will guarantee him…” (Genesis 43:9).

Another matter, “there as a small city” – this is Sinai, “and few men in it” – these are the Israelites, “and a great king came against it” – this is the King of kings the Holy One blessed be He, “and surrounded it and built a great siege upon it” – these are the two hundred and forty-eight positive commandments and the three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments. “He found in it a poor, wise man” – this is Moses, as it is stated: “No hand shall touch it…” (Exodus 19:13), “and he saved the city in his wisdom” – as it is stated: “Anyone who touches the mountain shall be put to death” (Exodus 19:12). “But no one remembered…” – the Holy One blessed be He said: You did not remember him; I remember him, as it is stated: “Remember the Torah of Moses, My servant…” (Malachi 3:22).

Another matter, “a small city” – this is the body, “and few men in it” – these are the limbs, “and a great king came against it” – this is the evil inclination.

David said: 'Good for one who heeds it; that is what is written: “Happy is one who attends to the helpless” (Psalms 41:2). “But no one remembered…” – the Holy One blessed be He said: You did not remember it; I remember it, “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh…” (Ezekiel 36:26).

Chapter 17

<b>“The words of the wise, softly spoken, are better heard than the cry of a ruler of fools” (Ecclesiastes 9:17).</b><br>“The words of the wise, softly spoken, are better heard” – these are the expounders, “than the cry of a ruler of fools” – these are the disseminators who stand before the public.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">In Talmudic times it was customary that when a scholar delivered a public lecture, a disseminator would stand near him and restate his teachings in a loud and melodious voice for the masses to hear.

Chapter 18

<b>“Wisdom is better than instruments of battle, and one sinner destroys much good” (Ecclesiastes 9:18).</b><br>“Wisdom is better than instruments of battle” – this is the wisdom of Jacob; “than instruments of battle” – of Esau the wicked.

For prayer, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “Please rescue me from the hand of my brother” (Genesis 32:12). For a gift, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “You shall say: From your servant Jacob, it is a gift sent” (Genesis 32:19). For war, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “He placed the maidservants [and their children first, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.] He passed before them and prostrated himself earthward” (Genesis 33:2–3). He said: It is preferable that he harm me and not my children.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, Jacob was prepared for the fact that Esau might act violently upon their encounter.</i> “Esau returned on that day on his way to Se’ir” (Genesis 33:16).

Another matter, “wisdom is better” – this is the wisdom of Seraḥ bat Asher, “than instruments of battle” – than the instruments of battle of Yoav, as it is stated: “A wise woman called from the city…[say to Yoav: Come close to here]” (II Samuel 20:16) – from here [it is derived] that he was far away. “He approached her, and she said to him” (II Samuel 20:17): You are not Yoav,<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">Yoav has the connotation of father [<i>av</i>].</i> you shorten,<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">You shorten the lives of the people.</i> you do not correspond to your name.

Perhaps for war?<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps one might think that the army initiates battle immediately; the aforementioned verse therefore teaches otherwise.</i> [This is] as is written: “She spoke, saying: They should have spoken initially…and the matter would have ended [<i>hetamu</i>]” (II Samuel 20:18). She said to him: ‘Is that all, have the words of the Torah ended [<i>tamu</i>], not to be fulfilled?’ He said to her: ‘Who are you?’ She said to him: ‘Who am I? “I am the loyal [<i>shelumei</i>] faithful of Israel” (II Samuel 20:19), it is I who completed [<i>hishlamti</i>] the tally of Israel in Egypt;<sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah lists sixty-nine descendants of Jacob who descended to Egypt, and then states that the total number of his descendants who went to Egypt was seventy (see Genesis 46:8–27) The midrash (<i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 94:9) asserts that the seventieth individual was Seraḥ bat Asher.</i> it is I who completed loyalty to Joseph and loyalty to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">She revealed to Moses where Joseph was buried so he could take his bones and bury them in the Land of Israel.</i> “And you are seeking to destroy a metropolitan city [<i>ir ve’em</i>] in Israel” (II Samuel 20:19); <i>ir</i>, this is Avel Beit Maakha,<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">This was the name of the city that Yoav had besieged (see II Samuel 20:15).</i> and me, who is a mother [<i>em</i>] in Israel.’<br>Immediately, “Yoav answered and said: Far be it from me…” (II Samuel 20:20) – far be it from Yoav, far be it from David, far be it from his kingdom. “The matter is not so. Rather a man from Mount Ephraim, his name is Sheva ben Bikhri, has raised his hand against the king, against David” (II Samuel 20:21). If [he already said] “against the king,” why [did he also say] “against David”; if “against David,” why “against the king”? Rabbi Azarya and Rabbi Yonatan ben Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon: This is to teach you that anyone who is impudent toward Torah scholars and a spiritual leader of the generation, it is as though he is impudent toward a king; all the more so, David, who was a king, a scholar, and a spiritual leader of the generation. Rabbi Yudan said: Anyone who is impudent toward the king it is as though he is impudent toward the Divine Presence, as it is written: “He raised his hand against the king, against David.” “Against the king” – that is the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, and then “against David” – this is David king of Israel.<br>[Yoav continued] “Turn him, alone, over, and I will go…[the woman said to Yoav: Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall]” (II Samuel 20:21). He said to her: ‘How do you know?’ She said to him: ‘Anyone who is impudent to the kingdom of the house of David incurs liability from above.’ Immediately, “the woman came to the people in her wisdom” (II Samuel 20:22). She said to them: ‘Will you not obey Yoav, will you not obey David? What nation has stood against them? What kingdom has stood against them?’ They said to her: ‘What does he demand?’ She said to them: ‘One thousand men.’ They said to her: ‘Each and every person will give in accordance with what he has.’<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Each household will turn over a proportion of its members.</i> She said to them: ‘I will go and appease him, perhaps he will [accept] fewer.’ She feigned going and returning.

She said to them: ‘He demands one man, and he is a non-resident [of our city].’ They said to her: ‘If he was the best man in the city we would submit him to [Yoav].’ She said to them: ‘His name is Sheva ben Bikhri.’ Immediately, they took the head of Sheva ben Bikhri and cast it over the wall. “And one sinner destroys much good” – this is Sheva ben Bikhri.
Another matter, “wisdom is better” – this is the wisdom of Hezekiah king of Judah, “than instruments of battle” – of Sennacherib. Rabbi Levi said: Sennacherib exiled three exiles: The first time, he exiled the tribes of Reuben and Gad; second, [he exiled] the [rest of the] ten tribes; third, he came against [the kingdom of] Judah. Immediately, Hezekiah stood and armed them with weapons on the inside and dressed them in white garments on the outside, and he prepared himself for three matters, for prayer, for a gift, and for war. For prayer, as it is written: “Hezekiah prayed to God…” (Isaiah 37:15). For a gift, as it is written: “At that time Hezekiah stripped the doors of the Sanctuary and the <i>omenot</i>” (II Kings 18:16). What are <i>omenot</i>? Rabbi Levi said hoops, and the Rabbis say hinges. For war, as it is stated: “He made weapons in abundance and shields” (II Chronicles 32:5). He inserted a sword at the entrance of the study hall and said: ‘Anyone who does not engage in Torah study, let this sword pass over his neck.’<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Torah study is also comparable to warfare (<i>Etz Yosef</i>; see, e.g., <i>Megilla</i> 15b) and its merit can bring success in war.</i> “Elyakim son of Hilkiya, who was in charge of the palace” (II Kings 18:37) – of the courts and administering punishment, “came, and Shevna the scribe” (II Kings 18:37) – in charge of the officials, “and Yoaḥ son of Asaf the secretary” (II Kings 18:37) – he was the elder of the house. “And one sinner destroys much good” – this is Sennacherib, as it is stated: “He returned in shame [to his land]” (II Chronicles 32:21), “and Esar Ḥadon his son reigned in his stead” (II Kings 19:37).

Parasha 10



Chapter 1

<b>“Dead flies spoil and froth a perfumer’s oil; a little folly is weightier than wisdom, than honor” (Ecclesiastes 10:1).</b><br>“Dead flies spoil and froth a perfumer’s oil” – ben Azai and Rabbi Akiva: ben Azai said: One fly that dies does not spoil and froth a perfumer’s oil; but a single sin that one performs will cause him to lose much good.<br>Rabbi Akiva expounded: “Therefore, the netherworld has expanded itself, and opened its mouth without limit [<i>ḥok</i>]” (Isaiah 5:14). It is not written <i>ḥukim</i>, but rather “without <i>ḥok</i>,” one who does not have mitzvot to tip the scales in favor of his virtues.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ḥok</i> (plural, <i>ḥukim</i>) can mean limit or statute. Rabbi Akiva interprets the verse according to the second meaning, such that the verse means that the netherworld takes a person who is missing just one mitzva that would have tipped the scales in his favor.</i><br>Those who engage in allegorical interpretations of the Torah say: A person is judged on the basis of the majority of his [deeds]. A person should always assess himself as though he is half virtuous and half guilty; if he performs one mitzva, happy is he, as he tipped his scales in favor of virtue, if he performs one transgression, woe is he, as he tipped his scales in favor of guilt. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Because the individual is judged on the basis of the majority of his [deeds], and the world is judged on the basis of its majority, with the single transgression that this one [individual] performs, he causes himself and the world to lose much good.
Another matter: “Dead flies spoil [<i>yavish</i>] and froth [<i>yabia</i>] a perfumer’s oil” refers to the congregation of Koraḥ. Yesterday they were vilifying [<i>mavishin</i>] Moses and saying: Moses is not a true prophet, Aaron is not the High Priest, and Torah is not from Heaven, and today<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">After they were swallowed by the ground, Koraḥ and his congregation declared, from the depths of the earth, that Moses had been correct (see <i>Bemidbar Rabba</i> 18:20; <i>Bava Batra</i> 74a).</i> they are expressing [<i>mabi’im</i>] matters before Moses and saying: Moses is a true prophet, Aaron is the High Priest, and Torah is from Heaven. “Weightier than wisdom, than honor” – this is prophecy; “a little folly”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded to refer to the punishment of Koraḥ and his congregation, which they received due to their folly.</i> – this is the decree of Moses, who said: “But if the Lord will create a creation [and the ground will open its mouth and swallow them up…then you will know that these men have despised the Lord]” (Numbers 16:30).<br>Another matter: “Dead flies spoil and froth a perfumer’s oil…” refers to Do’eg and Aḥitofel. Yesterday, they were vilifying David with their words and saying: His lineage is flawed; does he not descend from Ruth the Moavite? Today they are expressing matters and are ashamed. “Weightier than wisdom, than honor” – this is the prophecy of David.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">David’s former antagonists eventually admitted that he was a worthy king and prophet.</i> “A little folly” – “You, God, bring them down to the pit of destruction…” (Psalms 55:24).<br>Another matter: “Dead flies spoil and froth a perfumer’s oil…” is speaking of the generation of Elijah, who would vilify him with their words and say: “Baal, answer us” (I Kings 18:26). Today they are expressing matters and saying: “The Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is God” (I Kings 18:39). “Weightier than wisdom, than honor” – this is prophecy, this is the prophecy of Elijah. “A little folly” – “Elijah took them down to the Kishon Stream and slaughtered them” (I Kings 18:40).

Chapter 2

<b>“The heart of the wise is to his right, and the heart of a fool is to his left” (Ecclesiastes 10:2).</b><br>“The heart of the wise is to his right…” – Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: [This is analogous] to two people who had two <i>kor</i>, one of wheat and one of barley. One of them said to the other: ‘If yours is of barley mine is of wheat, and if mine is of wheat yours is of barley. In any case, I am taking the one of wheat.’ So, Abraham said to Lot: “If to the left, I will go to the right, and if to the right, I will go to the left [<i>asme’ila</i>]” (Genesis 13:9). Rabbi Ḥanina ben Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is not written here “<i>esmola</i>,” but rather “<i>asme’ila</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Esmola</i> means, “I will go to the left.” <i>Asme’ila</i> can mean, “I will cause to go to the left.”</i> Even if you are impertinent, I will cause you to go to the left.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham told Lot: Ultimately, I will go to the right, the direction of the wise, and you will go to the left, which is the direction of the fool.</i> Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi], when a person would enter for judgment before him, if [the party that lost the case] would obey the ruling that would be fine, and if not, [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi] would say to a member of his household: ‘Cause him to go left’;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cause him to understand that he is wrong.</i> and he would signal and show him that he should strike him from the other side.<br>Another matter: “The heart of the wise is to his right” – this is Jacob, as it is stated: “Jacob arose and placed his sons and his wives [upon the camels]” (Genesis 31:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob understood that the main objective of marriage is producing the next generation. Therefore, he tended first to his sons and then to his wives.</i> “And the heart of a fool is to his left” – this is the wicked Esau, as it is stated: “Esau took his wives, his sons, [and his daughters]” (Genesis 36:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Esau prioritized his own pleasure; therefore he tended to his wives and then to his sons. It was not because he was concerned with his wives’ safety that he tended to them first, as he tended to his daughters, who were even more vulnerable, last.</i>

Chapter 3

<b>“Even when a fool walks on the way his heart is lacking; and he says to everyone that he is a fool” (Ecclesiastes 10:3).</b><br>“Even when a fool walks on the way…” – a fool believes that all the people are fools like him, but he does not know that he is a fool and all the people are wise.

Chapter 4

<b>“If the spirit of the ruler comes upon you, do not forsake your place, as in its abating he will pardon great sins” (Ecclesiastes 10:4).</b><br>“If the spirit of the ruler comes upon you, do not forsake your place” – when dominion comes to you, do not forsake your attribute of humility, to teach you that anyone who forsakes his humility causes death to his world and sin to his generation. From whom do you learn this? From Zekharia, as it is stated: “The spirit of God clothed Zekharia….and he stood above the people” (II Chronicles 24:20). Did he, in fact, walk above the people? It is, rather, that he considered himself greater than all the people; son-in-law of the king,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He was actually the grandson, the son of the son-in-law, of King Yehoram. He was also a cousin to King Yoash, who was king of Judah at the time of this event.</i> priest, prophet, and judge. He began speaking arrogantly to the people, and saying to them: “Why are you violating the mitzvot of the Lord so that you will not succeed?” (II Chronicles 24:20). Immediately, “they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the command of the king [in the courtyard of the house of the Lord]” (II Chronicles 24:21).<br>Rabbi Yudan asked Rabbi Aḥa: Where did they kill Zekharia, in the Israelite Courtyard or in the Women’s Courtyard? [Rabbi Aḥa] said to him: Neither in the Israelite Courtyard nor in the Women’s Courtyard, but rather in the Priests’ Courtyard. They did not treat his blood like the blood of a gazelle or the blood of a deer. Regarding the blood of a gazelle and a deer whose blood has been spilled, it is written: “You shall spill its blood and cover it with dirt” (Leviticus 17:13), but this righteous one [Zekharia], they did not treat his blood like the blood of a gazelle and not like the blood of a deer. Why [did God allow them to be wicked] to such an extent? It was “to arouse fury and to take vengeance” (Ezekiel 24:8). You find that when Nevuzaradan<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuzaradan was the officer who led the Babylonian troops in sacking Jerusalem and destroying the Temple (see II Kings 25:8–22).</i> ascended to destroy Jerusalem, the Holy One blessed be He indicated to that blood that it should seethe. He said to it:<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy One blessed be He said to the blood.</i> This is the time that you will collect your debt. [Nevuzaradan] said to them: ‘What is the nature of this blood?’ They said to him: ‘It is the blood of bulls, rams, and sheep that we were sacrificing to the Holy One blessed be He.’ Immediately, he brought bulls, rams, and sheep and slaughtered many of them onto it, but it did not stop. He said to them: ‘If you tell me, fine. But if not, I will comb the flesh of these people with a comb of iron,’ but [at first] they did not say. Once he [again] said to them that [their explanation] was not [true], they said to him: ‘Why should we conceal it from you? We had a prophet, a priest, who would reprimand us in the name of Heaven. [He said to us]: Accept it, but we did not accept it from him. Rather, we rose against him and killed him.’<br>[Nevuzaradan] said to them: ‘I will assuage it.’ He then brought the Great Sanhedrin and slaughtered them onto it, but it did not rest. He slaughtered the lesser Sanhedrin onto it, but it did not rest. He brought young priests and slaughtered them onto it, but it did not rest. He slaughtered schoolchildren onto it, but it did not rest. He said to [the seething blood]: ‘Zekharia, I have eliminated the best of your people. Would you like all of them to be eliminated?’ Immediately, it rested. That wicked one contemplated repentance, and said: ‘One who eliminates a single Israelite soul, it is written in his regard: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, his blood will be spilled by man” (Genesis 9:6); this man<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Nevuzaradan was referring to himself.</i> who eliminated many souls, all the more so.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He became filled with mercy, and He intimated to the blood, and it was absorbed in its place.<br>Rabbi Yudan said: [The Israelites] performed seven transgressions [via one act] on that day:<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">When they killed Zekharia.</i> They killed a priest, a prophet, and a judge, they spilled innocent blood, they impurified the Temple Courtyard, and it was Shabbat and Yom Kippur.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Killing is a prohibited labor on these days, as well as a profound violation of the sanctity of the day.</i><br>But Yaḥaziyel did not do so;<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">He did not become haughty when he achieved an elevated status.</i> rather, “Yaḥaziyel, son of Zekharia, son of Benaya, son of Yaḥaziyel, son of Matanya the Levite, from the sons of Asaf, the spirit of the Lord was upon him in the midst of the assembly” (II Chronicles 20:14). What is “in the midst of the assembly”? It is that he likened himself to the assembly.<br>Another matter: “If the spirit of the ruler comes upon you,” is speaking of Noah.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse to refer to a ruler issuing a command to you. If he commands you to be in a certain place, do not forsake that place without another official command.</i> He entered the ark with permission and he emerged with permission. From where [is it derived] that he entered with permission? [It is from the verse:] “Come you and all your household to the ark” (Genesis 7:1). From where [is it derived] that he emerged with permission? [It is from the verse:] “Go out of the ark, you …” (Genesis 8:16).<br>Another matter: “If the spirit of the ruler comes upon you,” is speaking of Joshua. Just as the Israelites crossed the Jordan with permission, so too they emerged only with permission. From where [is it derived that] they crossed with permission? As it is stated: “Pass through the midst of the camp…[in another three days you are crossing this Jordan]” (Joshua 1:11). They emerged with permission, as it is stated: “Joshua commanded the priests saying: Emerge from the Jordan” (Joshua 4:17).<br>Another matter: “If the spirit of the ruler…” is speaking of David. Before he reigned, “David is the youngest” (I Samuel 17:14). When he reigned, “King David stood on his feet [and said: Hear me my brethren]” (I Chronicles 28:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">He remained humble even after he assumed the throne.</i><br>Another matter: “If the spirit of the ruler…” is speaking of Mordekhai.

<b>“There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, like an error that emerges from before the ruler” (Ecclesiastes 10:5).</b><br>“There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, like an error that emerges from before the ruler” – so said Jacob to Laban: “With whomever you find your gods, he shall not live […and Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them]” (Genesis 31:32). So it was, “like an error that emerges from before the ruler,” and Rachel died.<br>The son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi had something that he swallowed [lodged in his throat].

Chapter 6

<b>“Folly is set on great heights, and the wealthy sit in lowliness” (Ecclesiastes 10:6).</b><br>“Folly is set on great heights” – these are the Chaldeans, as it is written: “All the princes of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate” (Jeremiah 39:3). What is the Middle Gate [<i>shaar hatavekh</i>]? It is the place where they determine [<i>meḥatkhin</i>] the <i>halakhot</i>. “And the wealthy sit in lowliness” – this is the Sanhedrin, as it is stated: “They will sit on the ground and be silent [the elders of the daughter of Zion]” (Lamentations 2:10).

Chapter 7

<b>“I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking on the ground like servants” (Ecclesiastes 10:7).</b><br>“I have seen servants upon horses” – these are Ishmaelites; “and princes walking on the ground like servants” – this is Joseph. Rabbi Levi said: A slave<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning an Egyptian, as the Egyptians were descendants of Canaan, of whom it is written: “Accursed is Canaan, a slave of slaves he shall be to his brothers” (Genesis 9:25).</i> purchased, and the son of a maidservant<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Ishmaelites, who descended from Hagar</i> sold, and a free man was sold to both of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Joseph, who was sold to Ishmaelites, who then sold him to an Egyptian (see Genesis 37:28, 36).</i><br>Rabbi Akiva was ascending to Rome; he encountered a certain eunuch<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">He was castrated as a youth and raised to serve in the Roman priesthood.</i> from the royal court. He said to him: ‘Are you the rabbi of the Jews?’ [Rabbi Akiva] said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to [Rabbi Akiva]: ‘Hear these three matters from me: One on a horse is a king; one on a donkey is a free man; one with shoes on his feet is a person; [therefore,] one without this and without that, one buried in a ditch is preferable to him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The eunuch was riding a horse, whereas Rabbi Akiva was walking barefoot because of a public fast, on which it was forbidden to wear shoes (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i> [Rabbi Akiva] said: ‘You said three matters, hear from me three alternative matters: The glory of a face is the beard, the joy of the heart is a wife, and “the portion of the Lord is children” (Psalms 127:3). Woe unto that man who is lacking these three.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The eunuch was unable to grow a beard, marry, or beget children.</i> Moreover, the verse preceded it: “I have seen servants upon horses.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This contradicts the eunuch’s statement that only kings ride on horses.</i> When that eunuch heard this, he banged his head against the wall and died.<br>Another matter: “I have seen servants upon horses” – this is Ahab; “and princes walking on the ground like servants” – this is Elijah, as it is stated: “[And Ahab rode and went to Yizre’el.] The hand of the Lord was upon Elijah, and he girded his loins and ran before Ahab…” (I Kings 18:45–46).

Chapter 8

<b>“One who digs a pit will fall into it; and one who breaches a fence, a serpent will bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8).</b><br>“One who digs a pit will fall into it” – this is the wicked Pharaoh, who said: “Every son who is born [you shall cast him into the Nile]” (Exodus 1:22). “He will fall into it” – as it is stated: “He shook Pharaoh and his people in the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:15).<br>Another matter: “One who digs a pit” – this is Haman, as it is stated: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). “Will fall into it” – as it is stated: “His wicked intentions will return […upon his head, and he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows]” (Esther 9:25).<br>“One who breaches a fence, a serpent will bite him” – this is Dina. When her father and her brothers were sitting in the study hall, she went out “to see the daughters of the land” (Genesis 34:1). She brought upon herself that Shekhem ben Ḥamor the Hivite, who is called a serpent,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Hivite is related to the Aramaic word <i>ḥivya</i>, which means serpent.</i> consorted with her and bit her, as it is written: “Shekhem ben Ḥamor saw her…” (Genesis 34:2). “He took her” (Genesis 34:2) – he seduced her with words, as it is stated: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3). “He lay with her” (Genesis 34:2) – with natural intercourse; “and he raped her” (Genesis 34:2) – with unnatural intercourse.<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai and Rabbi Elazar his son went into hiding in a cave in Pekiin for thirteen years during a period of religious persecution. They would eat carobs and dates. At the conclusion of thirteen years, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai emerged and sat at the entrance to the cave. He saw a trapper placing his traps to trap birds. He heard a Divine Voice saying: ‘Success,’ and [a bird] was trapped. He heard a Divine Voice a second time, saying: ‘Failure,’ and [a bird] escaped. He said: Even a bird, without a divine decree, will not escape; all the more so the soul of a person.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Shimon was saying: Since it is in God’s hands whether or not we will be caught, we do not need to continue hiding in the cave (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>[Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said to his son:] ‘Let us descend and be healed in the water of the hot springs of Tiberias.’<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently conditions in the cave led them to suffer from skin ailments, and they hoped the hot springs would heal their skin (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> They descended and were healed in the water of the hot springs of Tiberias. They said: We must do good, and benefit the residents of this place, just as Jacob our patriarch did, as it is stated: “He encamped [<i>vayiḥan</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded as a reference to both market [<i>ḥanut</i>] and favor [<i>ḥanina</i>].</i> before the city” (Genesis 33:18), [indicating] that he established a market and sold to them at low prices. They established a market and sold to them at low prices. He said: We must purify Tiberias.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">During the Roman conquest there were many casualties who were buried in unmarked graves, causing Tiberias to lose its presumptive status of purity.</i> What did he do? He took lupines and scattered them in the street, and any place that a corpse was buried, it rose.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">It became visible on the surface of the ground.</i><br>A certain Samaritan saw him. He said: Am I not able to ridicule this Jewish elder? What did he do? He took a corpse and buried it in a street that they had purified. Some say it was [in the market] of the barrel makers and some say in the market of the sack makers. He came and said to [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai]: ‘Did you purify such and such street?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘And if I produce a corpse for you from it?’ He said: ‘Pull it out and show me.’ Immediately, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai saw through divine inspiration that he had buried it there; he said: ‘I decree that the one who is lying shall stand and that the one standing will lie.’ Some say [that he said]: ‘I decree that the one above will descend and the one below will ascend.’ And so it occurred to him.<br>He departed and passed before that synagogue in Migdal and heard the voice of Nakai the scribe: ‘Did ben Yoḥai purify Tiberias?’<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">He was mocking Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai because of the corpse found on the street he had already purified.</i> [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai] said: ‘ <If not>, let [such and such] come upon me if I do not have traditions as numerous as the hairs on my head that this [city of] Tiberias is destined to be purified and will be available to those who partake of <i>teruma</i>, with the exception of this and that.’<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Only these streets will remain impure.</i> He did not believe him. [Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai] said to [Nakai]: ‘You have breached the fence of the Torah scholars, “and one who breaches a fence, a serpent will bite him,”’ and so it occurred to him.<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai was passing by during the Sabbatical Year; he saw a certain person who was harvesting aftergrowths<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">These are grain and vegetables that grow on their own without cultivation.</i> of the Sabbatical Year. He said to him: ‘But is it not the Sabbatical Year?’ He said to him: ‘But is it not you who permits it? Did we not learn: [Rabbi Shimon says:] All aftergrowths are permitted except for the aftergrowths of cabbage, because there is nothing corresponding to them in the growths of the field?’<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Sheviit</i> 9:1. Since cabbage does not grow wild in the field, one must assume that it was cultivated in violation of the laws of the Sabbatical Year.</i> [Rabbi Shimon] said to him: ‘But do my colleagues not disagree with me?’<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages in the Mishna prohibit consumption of even uncultivated annual crops that grow during the Sabbatical Year.</i> He read in his regard: “And one who breaches a fence, a serpent will bite him,” and so it occurred to him.

Chapter 9

<b>“One who transports stones will be saddened by them; and one who splits wood will benefit from it” (Ecclesiastes 10:9).</b><br>“One who transports stones will be saddened by them” – one who transports himself from his studies will ultimately be sorry. He will seek a matter but will not find it.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">He will seek to recall some detail of his Torah study but will not remember it.</i><br>“And one who splits wood will benefit [<i>yisakhen</i>] from it.” As long as he toils in it, he will benefit from it, just as you say: “She will be an attendant [<i>sokhenet</i>] for him” (I Kings 1:2).<br>Another matter: “One who transports stones” from place to place “will be saddened by them”; “and one who splits wood will benefit from it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Previously the midrash interpreted the phrase “one who transports stones” to refer to one who removes himself from Torah study, as stones are an allusion to the tablets given at Sinai. Now the midrash interprets the verse literally as referring to one who moves stones from place to place. Unscrupulous individuals might remove stones from their fields to the public domain, but ultimately it is they who will stumble (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i> Rabbi Meyashya said: In reward for the two logs that Abraham chopped on Mount Moriah, he was privileged to have the sea split for his descendants into twelve strips.

Chapter 10

<b>“If the iron is dull, and one did not whet the edge, he must intensify his exertion; the advantage is in preparation with wisdom” (Ecclesiastes 10:10).</b><br>“If the iron is dull,” if the teacher’s face is dull toward his student like iron,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The teacher is not interested in expending energy to explain the material to his students.</i> “and one did not [whet] the edge [<i>panim</i>],” and the teacher does not show the student a friendly countenance [<i>panim</i>], “whet [<i>kilkal</i>],” there is a deterioration [<i>kilkul</i>] in the actions of the student. “He must intensify his exertion” – what should [the student] do? He should bring ten people who will appease the teacher and, ultimately, he will have much preparation for wisdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">He will be in a much better position to attain wisdom.</i><br>Another matter: “If the iron is dull,” if the student’s face is dull toward his teacher, as it is stated: “Iron sharpens iron; [so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend]” (Proverbs 27:17),<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The teacher could be sharpened by the questions and insights of his student, but this student is dull and not insightful.</i> and [therefore,] the teacher does not show the student a friendly countenance, “<i>kilkal</i>,” there is a deterioration [<i>kilkul</i>] in the actions of the student. “He must intensify his exertion” – [the student] should bring ten people who will appease his teacher. “The advantage [<i>veyitron</i>] is in preparation [<i>hakhsheir</i>] with wisdom” – ultimately, he will relinquish [<i>motir</i>] his anger and will enable [<i>veyakhshir</i>] him [to succeed in] his studies.<br>Another matter: “If the iron is dull,” if your studies have become dull like iron, “and one did not whet the edge,” [your teacher] cannot come to explain it to you, overcome it with your own ability.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">If your teacher is no longer alive and you have unresolved questions, work hard to figure out the answers on your own (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>One of the students of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai forgot his studies. He went crying to the cemetery. As he was crying profusely, he was shown a dream, and [a voice] said to him: When you cast three pebbles at me I will come. That student went to an interpreter of dreams and recounted the incident to him. [The interpreter of dreams] said to him: ‘Recite your studies three times and it will come to you.’<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Recite each thing you learn three times and you will remember it (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> He did so, and so it was for him.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said: If the nation whose power is as strong as iron, as it is written: “And the Lord took you and brought you out from the iron crucible, from Egypt” (Deuteronomy 4:20), becomes dull; “and one did not whet the edge” – and the Holy One blessed be He is not forthcoming toward the generation; “<i>kilkal</i>” – there are evil deeds in this generation. What shall they do? “He must intensify his exertion” – let them decree fasts, and the Holy One blessed be He will grant them eternal forgiveness.<br>Rabbi Ḥama bar Pappa said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: If the skies above your heads have become dull like iron,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">There is no rain.</i> as it is stated: “I will render your skies like iron” (Leviticus 26:19), and the Holy One blessed be He is not forthcoming, there are corrupt [<i>kilkal</i>] actions in the generation. What shall they do? They shall decree a fast, and the Holy One blessed be He will provide relief to His world.

Chapter 11

<b>“If the serpent may bite without a spell, there is no advantage to the charmer” (Ecclesiastes 10:11).</b><br>“If the serpent may bite without a spell [<i>laḥash</i>]” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: A serpent bites only if it was whispered [<i>nilḥash</i>] to from above, and the lion devours only if it was whispered to from above, and a kingdom aggravates people only if it was whispered to from above.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">God determines whether one will be persecuted by the government.</i><br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: [If] they [would] say to the serpent: ‘Why does your tongue bite one limb, but all of them feel it and tremble,’ it [would] say to them: ‘You are speaking to me? Speak to the one with a tongue.’<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states: “There is no advantage to the charmer [<i>baal halashon</i>].” The most literal translation of the phrase <i>baal halashon</i> is “one with a tongue.” The term serpent is used here as a reference to one who speaks slander, which causes widespread damage.</i> [If the serpent would be asked:] ‘Why does your tongue slobber,’ [it would say:] ‘Because it caused me [to be punished].’<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The serpent slandered God in the Garden of Eden (see Genesis, chap. 3).</i> [If it would be asked:] ‘Why is your body lacking,’ [it would say:] ‘My tongue caused it.’<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">This is a punishment for my sin, by means of my tongue, which caused the sin.</i> [If one asked it:] ‘Why does your tongue bite one limb, but all of them feel it and tremble,’ it [would] say to him: ‘You are speaking to me?

The serpent came and taught about the downfall of Edom, as it is stated: “Its sound will go like the serpent’s” (Jeremiah 46:22).<br>The Rabbis liken it<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">They liken the loud sound of the serpent to the loud sound of the Tigris River.</i> to this verse: “The name of the third river is Tigris” (Genesis 2:14).

Chapter 12

<b>“The words of the mouth of the wise are grace; but the lips of the fool will swallow him” (Ecclesiastes 10:12).</b><br>“The words of the mouth of the wise are grace” – this is Cyrus, king of Persia, who said: “Any among you from His entire people, may his God be with him, and he may go up [to Jerusalem]” (Ezra 1:3). “But the lips of the fool will swallow him” – as he recanted his words and retracted them.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Cyrus initially allowed the rebuilding of the Temple, but he is also identified with Artaḥshasta, who ordered that the construction of the Temple be stopped (see Ezra, chap. 4; <i>Esther Rabba</i> 1:3).</i>

Chapter 13

<b>“The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his mouth is evil debauchery” (Ecclesiastes 10:13).</b><br>“The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness” – as [Cyrus] said: “He is the God, who is in Jerusalem” (Ezra 1:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Implying He is God only in Jerusalem.</i> “And the end of his mouth is evil debauchery” – as he recanted and abrogated his decrees and said: Whoever has crossed<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The Euphrates</i> has crossed, and whoever has not crossed shall not cross.<br>Another matter: “The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness” – this is Aḥashverosh, as it is stated: “And in the reign of Aḥashverosh, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote libel [against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem]” (Ezra 4:6). “And the end of his mouth [is evil debauchery]” – as he arose and abrogated the labor of the construction of the Temple.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Aḥashverosh, who is also identified as Artaḥshasta, began his reign with the foolish decree to stop the rebuilding of the Temple due to the libel, and he continued to prevent its rebuilding for the remainder of his reign.</i>

Chapter 14

<b>“The fool will increase words; man does not know what will be, and what will be after him, who can tell him” (Ecclesiastes 10:14).</b><br>“The fool will increase words” – Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Simon interpreted the verse regarding Moses. The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: I wrote in your regard that you are wise, but you are standing and speaking extensively, and you are not wise, “do not continue to speak to Me further about this matter” (Deuteronomy 3:26).

Chapter 15

<b>“The toil of the fools will exhaust him, as he will not know to go to a city” (Ecclesiastes 10:15).</b><br>“The toil of the fools will exhaust him” – this is a student who stagnates in his study; “as he will not know to go to a city” – should he not have gone to his teacher to restore his learning to him?<br>Another matter: “The toil of the fools will exhaust him” – this is Yiftaḥ; “as he will not know to go to a city” – should he not have gone to Pinḥas so he would annul his vow for him?<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Yiftaḥ had vowed that the first item that would exit his house to meet him upon his return home would be a sacrifice to God. When he returned home, his daughter was first to exit his house, and because of the vow, she lived out her life in solitude (see Judges 11:30–40).</i> However, Yiftaḥ said: ‘I am the chief and commander of Israel; shall I go to Pinḥas?’ Pinḥas said: ‘I am a High Priest, son of a High Priest; shall I go to an ignoramus?’ Between the two of them that unfortunate one was lost, and the two of them are liable for her blood. Yiftaḥ’s limbs were severed one after another and buried, as it is written: “He was buried in the cities of Gilad” (Judges 12:7). In how many places was he buried that you say: “He was buried in the cities of Gilad”? Rather, it teaches that his limbs were severed one after another, and each one was buried in its place. What did Pinḥas lose? The Divine Spirit left him for two hundred years, as it is not written, “he was chief over them,” but it is written: “Pinḥas ben Elazar had been chief over them; in the past the Lord was with him” (I Chronicles 9:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The Lord had been with him in the past, but was not with him in the present.</i>

Chapter 16

<b>“Woe is you, land, whose king is a lad, and your princes dine in the morning. Happy are you, land, that your king is a free man, and your princes dine at the proper time, in valor and not in drunkenness” (Ecclesiastes 10:16–17).</b><br>“Woe is you, land, whose king is a lad” – it is written: “Then, two women who were prostitutes came” (I Kings 3:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">They each had a baby and one of the babies died. Each claimed the live one was hers, and they came before King Solomon for adjudication. See I Kings 3:16–28.</i> Who were they? Rabbi Meir says: They were spirits. The Rabbis say: They were women awaiting levirate marriage.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">If a man dies without children, his widow is subject to the law of levirate marriage. The husbands of these women died without children but while their wives were pregnant, and the women subsequently gave birth. However, a child who dies within the first thirty days does not exempt the mother from levirate marriage, and therefore an outcome of the case would be the determination of which woman would be subject to levirate marriage (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>).</i> Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua says: They were actual prostitutes, and he issued their verdict without witnesses and forewarning. “The one woman said: Please, my lord…it was on the third day after I gave birth…the son of this woman died” (I Kings 3:17–19) because she rolled upon him. “She arose during the night.… I arose in the morning to nurse my son.… The woman said: No, but…. The king said: This one says…” (I Kings 3:20–23). Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Yirmeya [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Beivai, and some tend to cite it in the name of Rabbi Pedat: The procedure of the judgment is as follows: The judge sits, the judged stand, the mediator decides between them,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentaries suggest that the phrase “the mediator decides between them” is mistaken and should not appear (see Rabbi David Luria).</i> the plaintiff lodges his complaint, the defendant responds, and the judge decides between them. Rabbi Simon said: From here it is derived that the judge must reiterate their claims, from this verse: “[The king said:] This one says: This is my son that lives [and your son is the dead], and that one says: [No, your son is the dead and my son is the living]” (I Kings 3:23).<br>“The king said: Bring me a sword.… The king said: Cut the living child.… The woman whose child was the living one…” (I Kings 3:24–26) – Rabbi Yehuda said that Rabbi Ilai said: Had I been there, I would have wrapped soft wool around his neck,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Around Solomon’s neck, as a judge who issues a false judgment is executed by strangulation.</i> as when he said: “Bring me a sword,” had [the mother] not been overcome by mercy for him [her child], he would have been killed. Regarding that moment, it says: “Woe is you, land, whose king is a lad.” At that moment, he began spouting wisdom; he said: Was it for nothing that the Holy One blessed be He created in this person two eyes, two ears, two feet, two hands? It was because the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that this judgment is destined to transpire.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy One blessed be He created man proportionally so it would be possible to cut the child lengthwise into two equal parts.</i> [Ultimately] he did not do so, but rather he said: “Give her the living child, and do not kill him” (I Kings 3:27). Regarding that moment, it says: “Happy are you, land, that your king is a free man and your princes dine at the proper time” – at the time of the World to Come; “and not in drunkenness [<i>vashti</i>]” – in his strength and not in his weakness [<i>bitshisho</i>]. “The king answered and said: Give her the living child.” The Divine Spirit was shouting and saying: She is certainly his mother.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: In three places, the attribute of justice shouted: In the court of Shem, in the court of Samuel, and in the court of Solomon. In the court of Shem, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Judah recognized and said: She is more righteous than I” (Genesis 38:26), and the Divine Spirit shouted and said: All of these matters originated with Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The events leading up to the trial (see Genesis, chap. 38) were a result of Divine providence.</i> In the court of Samuel, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Here I am; testify against me before the Lord.… He said to them: The Lord is witness for you, and His anointed is witness” (I Samuel 12:3–5). It is not written here, “they said…witness,” but rather, “he said…witness.” Who said “witness”? The Divine Spirit said: ‘You will testify regarding the revealed, and I will testify regarding the concealed.’ In the court of Solomon, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The king answered and said: Give her the living child” (I Kings 3:27). The Divine Spirit shouted and said: She is certainly his mother.<br>Another matter: “Woe is you, land, whose king is a lad” – these are the kings of Israel; “happy are you, land, that your king is a free man” – these are the kings of Judah. “And your princes dine in the morning” – these are the kings of Israel; “and your princes dine at the proper time” – these are the kings of Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">The kings of Israel were wicked, and therefore consumed in this world all goodness they will receive. Many of the kings of Judah were righteous, and have a share in the World to Come.</i>

<b>“With slothfulness the ceiling sags and with idleness of the hands the house leaks” (Ecclesiastes 10:18).</b><br>“With slothfulness the ceiling sags” – because the Israelites were slothful from encamping at Mount Sinai in dispute,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Although the Israelites had engaged in disputes in their other encampments, when they encamped at Sinai they did so peacefully.</i> “the ceiling sags” – it is written: “He bent the heavens and descended” (Psalms 18:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">God descended to them and rested His presence in their midst.</i> “And with idleness [<i>uvshiflut</i>] of the hands the house leaks” – because the Israelites humbled themselves [<i>nishtapelu</i>] [and refrained] from encamping in dispute at Mount Sinai, “the house leaks” – “the clouds, too, dripped water” (Judges 5:4).<br>Another matter: “With slothfulness the ceiling sags” – because the Israelites were slothful in repenting in the days of Jeremiah, “the ceiling sags,” – “He uncovered the covering of Judah” (Isaiah 22:8), he removed its covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The roof of the Temple.</i> “And with idleness [<i>uvshiflut</i>] of the hands the house leaks” – because the Israelites abased themselves [<i>nishtapelu</i>] from repenting in the days of Jeremiah, “the house leaks,” it is written: “For behold, the Lord commands, and He will shatter the great house<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">The ten tribes of the kingdom of Israel.</i> into smithereens and the small house<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">The two tribes of the kingdom of Judah.</i> into fragments” (Amos 6:11).

<b>“A feast is made for laughter, wine cheers the living, and money answers everything” (Ecclesiastes 10:18).</b><br>“A feast is made for laughter” – for revelry of idol worship one makes a feast. “Wine cheers the living” – this is the Torah, as it is stated: “The precepts of the Lord are upright, cheering the heart” (Psalms 19:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to idolatry, for which one must make a feast in order to stimulate joy, Torah itself brings happiness without external stimuli (Rabbi David Luria).</i><br>“Money answers everything” – Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin [said] in the name of Rabbi Levi: At times one is answered and at times one is not answered. At times, when one performs with it [money] acts of righteousness, he is answered, as it is stated: “My righteousness will speak on my behalf” (Genesis 30:33). At times, when one does not perform with it acts of righteousness, it denounces him; this is what you say: “To give false testimony against him” (Deuteronomy 19:16).<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, a certain neighbor called him. He saw people standing, dancing, and clapping, and [the hosts] gave them food and drink. He said: This is good. I, too, will stand, dance, and sing. He stood, danced, and sang, and they gave him a wineskin of aged wine. He read in his regard: “A feast is made for laughter.”

When I arrived at the province of Kapotkeya, I saw him, that he was sitting before me and asking questions. I said to him: ‘My son, how did you ascend from the sea?’ He said: ‘Rabbi, due to your prayer, each wave cast me to another, and another to another until they caused me to reach dry land.’ I said to him: ‘My son, what deeds do you have to your credit?’ He said: ‘When I boarded the ship, a certain unfortunate man encountered me. He said to me: Perform charity for me, and I gave him a loaf. He said to me: Just as you gave me my life with your gift, so may your life be given to you.’ I read in his regard: “Cast your bread on the surface of the water.”<br>There was an incident involving a certain large ship that set sail in the Mediterranean Sea.

These days too are considered festivals, and the blessing of <i>Sheheḥeyanu</i> is recited, as on other festivals (Rabbi David Luria).</i><br>Rabbi Azarya says: “Distribute a portion to seven” – this is the generation that Moses circumcised after seven;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Seven generations after Abraham circumcised the members of his household.</i> “and also to eight” – this is the generation that Joshua circumcised after eight, as it is written: “At that time, the Lord said to Joshua…circumcise the children of Israel a second time.” (Joshua 5:2). By inference, [this indicates] that [Moses] had circumcised them in the first instance. “Joshua made [flint knives] for himself [and circumcised the children of Israel at the Hill of the Foreskins]” (Joshua 5:3) – [the name of this place indicates] that they made it a hill with [all their] foreskins.<br>Rabbi Neḥemya interpreted the verse regarding the princes: “Distribute a portion to seven” – as it is written: “On the seventh day the prince of the children of Ephraim” (Numbers 7:48). “And also to eight” – as it is written: “On the eighth day the prince of the children of Manasseh (Numbers 7:54).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the offerings of the princes of the tribes during the days of the inauguration of the Tabernacle.

Aquila the proselyte interpreted [the verse]: “I will command the clouds not to pour rain upon it” (Isaiah 5:6) [as follows]: I will command the prophets that they should not deliver prophecy to you. “If the tree falls in the south, or in the north” – if the time has come for a prophet to prophesy, whether in the south or in the north, all of Israel assembles, hears his prophecy, and learns from him.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: If you see troubles that are approaching and coming upon the land, it is due to Israel, who are called land, as it is stated: “As you will be a land of delight” (Malachi 3:12).

Chapter 5

<b>“Just as you do not know the path of the wind, or how the bones grow in the womb of one who is pregnant; so you will not know the work of God, who does everything” (Ecclesiastes 11:5).</b><br>“Just as you do not know” – there are seven matters obscured from people, and they are the day of death, the day of consolation, the profundity of judgment, how one profits, what is in the heart of another, what is in a woman’s pregnancy, and this kingdom of Edom, when it will fall. The day of death, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Man [also] does not know his time” (Ecclesiastes 9:12). The day of consolation, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “I am the Lord; at its time I will hasten it” (Isaiah 60:22). The profundity of judgment, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For judgment is God’s” (Deuteronomy 1:17). How one profits, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “This is the gift of God” (Ecclesiastes 5:18). What is in the heart of another, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “I am the Lord, who probes the heart” (Jeremiah 17:10). What is in a woman’s pregnancy, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Or how the bones grow in the womb of one who is pregnant.” And this kingdom of Edom, when it will fall, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For it is a day of vengeance in My heart” (Isaiah 63:4).

Chapter 6

<b>“In the morning, sow your seed, and in the evening do not rest your hand, as you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether they both alike will be good” (Ecclesiastes 11:6).</b><br>“In the morning, sow your seed” – Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua: Rabbi Eliezer says: If you sowed early in the season, sow [another field] late in the season, as you do not know which will endure for you, the early or the late. “As you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that.”<br>Rabbi Yehoshua says: If you married a woman in your youth and she died, marry in your old age. If you had children in your youth, you should have children in your old age, as it is stated: “In the morning, sow your seed, and in the evening do not rest your hand, as you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that.”<br>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva: Rabbi Yishmael says: If you studied Torah in your youth, study in your old age, as you do not know which Torah will endure, that of your youth or that of your old age, “or whether they both alike will be good.” Rabbi Akiva says: I had twelve thousand students from Gevat to Antipatris, and they all died during my lifetime, between Passover and <i>Shavuot</i>. Ultimately, seven promulgated my [Torah],<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Seven students whom I taught in my old age were responsible for dissemination of my Torah.</i> and these are they: Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, and Rabbi Yoḥanan the cobbler. He said to them: The first ones died only because they were begrudging to each other regarding their Torah. Do not be like that. They quickly rose and filled all of the Land of Israel with Torah.<br>Rabbi Natan <Kohen> interpreted the verse regarding a woman. If you married a woman in your youth, marry in your old age. Why? It is because you do not know which children will endure for you, whether it is those of your youth or of your old age, or “whether both alike will be good.”

Chapter 7

<b>“The light is sweet, and it is good for the eyes to behold the sun” (Ecclesiastes 11:7).</b><br>“The light is sweet, and it is good for the eyes” – the light of Torah is sweet and good for the eyes. Happy is he whose learning illuminates for him like the sun. Rabbi Aḥa says: The light of the World to Come is sweet. Happy is he who will merit to see that light, as it is stated: “The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun…” (Isaiah 30:26).

Chapter 8

<b>“For if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in all of them, and remember the days of darkness, as they will be many. Everything that is coming is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 11:8).</b><br>“For if [a man lives] many years,” “let him rejoice” in the joy of the Torah; “and remember the days of darkness” – these are the bad days, “as they will be many.” The Torah that a person studies in this world is vanity relative to the Torah of the Messiah.

Chapter 9

<b>“Rejoice, young man, in your youth. Let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth. Walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes, but know that for all these, God will bring you to judgment” (Ecclesiastes 11:9).</b><br>“Rejoice, young man, in your youth” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The Sages sought to suppress the book of Ecclesiastes because they found in it matters that tend toward heresy. They said: Is this the wisdom of Solomon, that he said: “Rejoice, young man, in your youth”? Moses said: “Do not stray after your heart” (Numbers 15:39), and Solomon said: “Walk in the ways of your heart.” Has restraint been loosened? Is there no judgment and no Judge? When he said: “For all these, God will bring you to judgment,” they said: Solomon has spoken well.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta: Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: [This is analogous] to one who fled from the inquisitor.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">An officer who would interrogate suspects, often by means of torture.</i> He was running, and [the inquisitor] was pursuing him.

He was fleeing and they were pursuing him. They said to him: Minimize [how far] you enter [the river] so you will not have so far to exit that you will tire. So too, “but know that for all these, God will bring you to judgment.”<br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: [This is analogous] to one who would steal the tax.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">He would transport goods across the border without paying taxes.</i> One time they apprehended him. They said to him: ‘Give us what you have with you.’ He said to them: ‘Take what I have with me.’ They said: ‘You think that we are going to take only what you have with you now? We are demanding from you everything that you have with you, and everything that you have stolen all these years that you have been stealing.’ So too, “but know that for all these, God will bring you to judgment.”<br>Rabbi Levi said: [This is analogous] to a bird that was trapped in a cage. A certain bird came and stood near it. It said to [the bird in the cage]: ‘Happy are you that your food is provided for you.’ [The caged bird] said to it: ‘Unlucky and unfortunate one. You are looking at my food, but my captivity you do not see. Tomorrow they will take me out and slaughter me.’ So too, “but know that for all these, God will bring you to judgment.”<br>Rabbi Tanḥum said: [This is analogous] to a wicked person who came to a storekeeper. He said to him: ‘Give me fat meat, aged wine, and various delicacies.’ He ate, drank, became intoxicated, and sought to leave. [The storekeeper] said to him: ‘Give me the payment for what you ate.’ He said: ‘The stomach of this man is before you.

If you were chosen in your old age, do not get carried away with matters of Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Do not get carried away in promulgating novel halakhic rulings.</i> but rather, “walk in the ways of your heart” – this is the Talmud that you learned from your teachers. “But know that for all these….” He will pay you the reward for mitzvot and good deeds.<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: [This is analogous] to one who would reject women<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">He would reject women as marriage partners.</i> and was steeped in promiscuity. He would say: ‘What woman whom I would want? Is this the woman I would want?’ He grew old and sought to marry a woman. They said to him: ‘Unlucky, unfortunate one, what woman would want you now that your nose runs, you are hard of hearing, and your eyesight is dim?’ So too, “but know that for all these, God will bring you to judgment.”<br>[This is analogous] to one who has fields and vineyards, but he did not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes. He grew old and became impoverished. He said: ‘If I had fields and vineyards, would I not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes?’ They said to him: ‘What was is in the past.’ So too, “but know that for all these, God will bring you to judgment.”

Parasha 12



Chapter 1

<b>“Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years arrive when you will say: I have no desire in them” (Ecclesiastes 12:1).</b><br>“Remove anger from your heart” (Ecclesiastes 11:10) – Rabbi Levi said: Every lad is hot-tempered, and every hot-tempered one is a fool. Solomon said: Since “childhood and youth are vanity” (Ecclesiastes 11:10), therefore, “remember your Creator [in the days of your youth].” We learned: Akavya ben Mahalalel says: Reflect on three matters: From where you came – from a putrid secretion; to where you are going – to a place of dust, maggots, and worms; and before whom are you destined to give an account and a reckoning – before the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi of Sikhnin said: Akavya expounded the three of them from one word: <i>Borekha</i>, <i>be’erkha</i>, <i>boraakha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">All these are expounded from the word “your Creator [<i>bore’ekha</i>]” in the verse.</i> <i>Borekha</i>, your pit, this is a putrid secretion; <i>be’erkha</i>, your well, this is maggots and worms;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sota</i> 2:2) this statement is reversed to read: <i>Borekha</i>, your pit, this is maggots and worms; <i>be’erkha</i>, your well, this is a putrid secretion.</i> and <i>boraakha</i>, your Creator, this is the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He. That is why it is stated: “Remember your Creator in the days of your youth” – when you are still in possession of your strength; “before the evil days come” – these are the days of old age; “and the years arrive [when you will say: I have no desire in them]” – this is suffering. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Neḥemya said: These are the messianic times, when there is neither merit nor liability.

Chapter 2

<b>“Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened, and the clouds return after the rain” (Ecclesiastes 12:2);</b><br>“Before the sun…are darkened” – this is [a person’s] countenance; “the light” – this is the nose; “the moon” – this is the forehead; “and the stars” – these are the cheekbones. “The clouds return after the rain” – Rabbi Levi said two matters about this, one for Torah scholars and one for ignoramuses. One for Torah scholars: One comes to weep, and his eyes shed tears [copiously]. One for ignoramuses: One who comes to urinate, excrement emerges and precedes it.

<b>“on the day that the guards of the house will tremble, the men of valor will be bent, the grinders will cease because they have dwindled, and it will be dark for those who gaze through the windows” (Ecclesiastes 12:3);</b><br>“On the day that the guards of the house will tremble” – these are the ribs; “the men of valor will be bent” – these are one’s arms. Rabbi Ḥiyya ben Rabbi Neḥemya says: These are one’s ribs. “The grinders will cease” – this is the stomach; “because they have dwindled” – these are the teeth; “and it will be dark for those who gaze through the windows” – Rabbi Ḥiyya ben Rabbi Neḥemya says: These are the edges of the lungs, from which the sound of the voice emerges.

Rabbi Ḥiyya ben Rabbi Neḥemya says: These are the kidneys that conceive, and the heart concludes.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash presents thought as being initiated by the kidneys and concluded by the heart, before it is expressed by the lips.</i>

The other <Rabbi Levi> said: He begins delineating subdivisions along the route. He says: Until this street, until this place, I am able to go, but until that place I am unable to go.<br>“The almond tree will blossom” – Rabbi Levi said: This is the nut-sized bone at the top of the spinal column.

He placed in on an anvil and struck it with a hammer. The anvil split, the hammer split, but it was to no avail.<br>“The grasshopper will be burdened” – these are one’s ankles. “The caper berry will fail” – this is the desire that sustains peace between a man and his wife;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The desire for marital relations.</i> it will cease.

The close have become distant – these are the ears which would hear after one time or two times, but now, even after one hundred times they do not hear. Two have become three – this is a cane and two legs. What sustains peace has ceased – this is the desire that brings about affection between a man and his wife.><br>“For the man goes to his eternal home” – it is not written here, “to the eternal home,” but rather, “his eternal home.” Reish Lakish said: [This is analogous] to a king who entered a province, accompanied by dukes, governors, and military commanders. Although all of them enter through one gate, each and every one stays in a place corresponding to his status. So too, although all taste the taste of death, each and every one has a world in and of himself. “And the mourners will circle in the streets” – these are the worms.

<b>“Before the silver cord is severed, the golden skull is shattered, the pitcher is smashed at the spring, and the wheel is shattered into the cistern” (Ecclesiastes 12:6);</b><br>“Before the silver cord is severed” – this is the spinal column; “the golden skull is shattered” – this is the skull.

Three days after [death] a person’s stomach bursts, and it moves [its contents] to the mouth and says to it: ‘Take for yourself what you stole and robbed and placed within me.’ Rabbi Ḥagai derives it from this verse: “I will scatter filth upon your faces, the filth of your festive offerings” (Malachi 2:3).

There were two roads there, one going toward the wilderness and one going toward the settlement [Jerusalem]. “To practice divination” – he began performing divination in the name of Rome, but it was not successful;<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">He performed divination to find out if he would be successful if he waged war against Rome, but the message he received was that he would not be successful.</i> in the name of Alexandria, but it was not successful; in the name of Jerusalem, and it was successful. “He shot arrows” in the name of Rome, but it was not successful; in the name of Alexandria, but it was not successful; in the name of Jerusalem, and it was successful.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He shot arrows straight up into the air and watched to see in which direction they would fall. When he shot with the intention to receive a sign about Jerusalem, the arrow sailed in the direction of Jerusalem.</i> He kindled lamps and lanterns in the name of Rome, but they did not light; in the name of Alexandria, but they did not light; in the name of Jerusalem, and they lit. He sailed boats on the Euphrates River in the name of Rome, but they did not move; in the name of Alexandria, but they did not move; in the name of Jerusalem, and they moved. “Consulted the <i>terafim</i>” – this is his idol worship. “And examined the liver” – Rabbi Levi said: Like an Arab who slaughters a lamb and examines its liver.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This is a form of divination.</i><br>“In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, [to place battering rams, to call for murder, to raise the voice with shouting, to place battering rams against the gates, to pour a ramp, to build a siege tower]” (Ezekiel 21:27) – the divination of Jerusalem was in his right hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">He was encouraged by the signs he received via divination that he would conquer Jerusalem. Alternatively, he cast lots, and the lot of Jerusalem came up in his right hand, indicating that he would conquer it.</i> “To place battering rams [<i>karim</i>]” – [to appoint] government officials [<i>kalorkhin</i>]; “to call for murder” – [to administer] death sentences; “to raise the voice” – [to sound] trumpets of war; “to place battering rams” – he deployed a siege; “to pour a ramp” – [from which they would catapult] stones; “and to build a siege tower” – ramps [to climb over the wall]. Regarding all of these [it could have been said]: “But it will be for them like a vain divination [in their eyes, who have weeks upon weeks, and it evokes iniquity for them to be captured]” (Ezekiel 21:28). The prophet said to Israel: Had you merited, you would have read the Torah that is expounded in seven times seven ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This is alluded to in the phrase “weeks upon weeks,” as a week has seven days.</i> Now that you have not merited, Nebuchadnezzar will divine seven times seven divinations upon you. Why to that extent? “And it evokes iniquity for them to be captured” – this is the blood of Zekharia.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Kohelet Rabba</i> 3:16, where the story is told of Zekharia, a prophet and priest, who was murdered in the Temple. This terrible act caused the Israelites to be punished with great bloodshed and suffering at the time of the destruction of the Temple.</i><br>“The almond tree will blossom” (Ecclesiastes 12:5) – this is the prophecy of Jeremiah, as it is stated: “I see the branch of an almond tree” (Jeremiah 1:11). Rabbi Elazar said: Just as an almond tree, from the moment that it blossoms until its fruit ripens is twenty-one days, so too, the entire decree was [carried out] only from the seventeenth of Tammuz until the ninth of Av.<br>“The grasshopper will be burdened” (Ecclesiastes 12:5) – this is the image of Nebuchadnezzar, as it is stated: “Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold;<b> </b>[its height was sixty cubits, and its width was six cubits]” (Daniel 3:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">It is referred to disdainfully as a grasshopper as a way to mock its giant size.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It emerges that you are saying that anything whose height is sixty and its width is six [is able to stand,] but [in fact] it requires a width one-third of its height. Rabbi Banai said: It was like a reed; he would place it upright and it would fall, he would place it upright and it would fall. Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak. It was incapable of standing until he brought all the silver and gold from Jerusalem. They poured it into a solid base before it as a stand for its feet. That is what is written: “They will cast their silver in the streets” (Ezekiel 7:19).<br>“The caper berry [<i>haaviyona</i>] will fail” (Ecclesiastes 12:5) – this is the merit of the patriarchs.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>aviyona</i> is expounded to mean father of a dove [<i>avi yona</i>], as the Jewish people are likened to a dove.</i> “For the man goes to his eternal home” (Ecclesiastes 12:5) – they were from Babylon,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham’s origins were in Babylon.</i> and to Babylon they returned. “And the mourners will circle in the streets” (Ecclesiastes 12:5) – this is the exile of Yekhonya. You find that at the time of the exile of Zedekiah,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The exile of Zedekiah, which took place in the wake of the destruction of the Temple, was eleven years after the exile of Yekhonya.</i> the members of the exile of Yekhonya emerged to greet them.

This ability, and certainly the records, were lost during the period of destruction and exile.</i> “the golden skull is shattered” (Ecclesiastes 12:6) – these are matters of Torah, as it is stated: “More pleasant than gold” (Psalms 19:11).<br>“The pitcher is smashed at the spring” (Ecclesiastes 12:6) – two <i>amora’im</i>: One says: The pitcher of Barukh at the spring of Jeremiah,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Barukh ben Neriya was the disciple of Jeremiah.

That is what is written: “[Then Barukh answered them:] From his own mouth he would recite all these words to me and I would write on the scroll with the ink” (Jeremiah 36:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse, Barukh copied down what Jeremiah said. The midrash may be alluding to the fact that Jeremiah was dependent upon Barukh’s skill as a scribe, which was enhanced by Divine inspiration (Maharzu); alternatively, Jeremiah the teacher was enriched by his student’s insights and questions (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>“And the wheel is shattered into the cistern” (Ecclesiastes 12:6) – they were from Babylon, and to Babylon they returned. They were from Babylon, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Abram: Go you from your land” (Genesis 12:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham’s original land was Ur Kasdim (see Genesis 11:31), which is in Babylon.</i> “And to Babylon they returned” – [as it is stated regarding Nebuchadnezzar:] “And exiled the people to Babylon” (Ezra 5:12). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Who says to the depths: Be dry” (Isaiah 44:27). “The depths” – this is Babylon. Why is it called “the depths”? Because the dead of the generation of the Flood were submerged there, as it is written: “As Babylon caused the dead of Israel to fall, [so at Babylon shall fall the dead of all the land]” (Jeremiah 51:49).<br>Reish Lakish said: It is written: “They found a valley in the land of Shinar” (Genesis 11:2). Why is it called Shinar? Because the dead of the generation of the Flood were transported [<i>sheninaru</i>] there [by the water]. Alternatively: Shinar, as they died in convulsions [<i>tashnuk</i>], without a lamp and without a bathhouse.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Because they were impoverished.</i> Alternatively: Shinar, as they were bereft [<i>meno’arim</i>] of the mitzvot, without <i>teruma</i> and tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">These mitzvot apply specifically in the Land of Israel.</i> Shinar, as their princes die as lads [<i>ne’arim</i>]. Shinar, as they established an enemy [<i>soneh</i>] and a destroyer [<i>va’er</i>]; and who is that? It is Nebuchadnezzar.<br>“And the dust returns to the earth as it was” (Ecclesiastes 12:7) – they were from Babylon, and to Babylon they returned. “And the spirit returns to God” – this is the Divine Spirit. You find that when Jeremiah saw Jerusalem destroyed, the Temple burned, Israel exiled, and the Divine Spirit that departed, he began [to speak] about them with [the phrase] “vanity of vanities” (Ecclesiastes 12:8).

Chapter 8



Chapter 9

<b>“Vanity of vanities, said Kohelet; everything is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 12:8).</b><br>“Vanity of vanities” – it is taught: When a wealthy person takes possession of a good item, at first he is desirous of it, but when it grows old for him, he uses it for trampling. A poor person, too, whose portion is meager, his eyes are directed to claim what the wealthy person rejects. This one has desire and that one has desire. They are both equal in terms of the grave;<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Each has desire and will die without having his desire fulfilled.</i> “everything is vanity.”

Chapter 10

<b>“Beyond the fact that Kohelet was wise, moreover, he taught the people knowledge, considered and analyzed, composed many proverbs. Kohelet sought to find words of delight, and what was written uprightly, words of truth” (Ecclesiastes 12:9–10).</b><br>“Beyond the fact that Kohelet was wise” – at the end of Ecclesiastes it is written: “Kohelet sought to find words of delight [<i>ḥefetz</i>]…”; Kohelet sought to understand the reward given for mitzvot, as it is written: “For in these I delight [<i>ḥafatzti</i>], the utterance of the Lord” (Jeremiah 9:23). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Solomon, “and what was written uprightly, words of truth,” I have written it in the Book of Uprightness:<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible</i> “How great is the goodness that You have stored for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20). Moreover, it is written: “For you will be a land of delight” (Malachi 3:12).<br>Moreover, he sought to understand the reward for Torah, as it is stated: “All objects [<i>ḥafatzim</i>] cannot equal it” (Proverbs 8:11). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Solomon, “and what was written uprightly, words of truth,” I have already written it in the Book of Uprightness. That is what is written: “No eye has seen, God, besides You” (Isaiah 64:3).<br>Kohelet sought to understand the end of days, when it will be, as it is stated: “That you not awaken, and you not rouse love, until it desires [<i>sheteḥpatz</i>]” (Song of Songs 2:7). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: I have already written it in the Book of Uprightness: “For the day of vengeance is in My heart, [and the year of My redemption has come]” (Isaiah 63:4).<br>Rabbi Shaul of Naveh teaches it in the name of Rabbi Shimon: If a person will say to you: When is the end of the redemption? You shall say to him: It is written: “For the day of vengeance is in My heart” (Isaiah 63:4). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon [said] in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: I indicated to you three indicators regarding the burial of Moses, “in the canyon, in the land of Moav, opposite Beit Peor” (Deuteronomy 34:6), and nevertheless, “no man knows his burial place” (Deuteronomy 34:6). If the heart does not reveal to the mouth, to whom will the mouth reveal?<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah gives three details as to the location of Moses’ burial, and yet it also states that no one knows the exact location. With regard to the redemption, the verse in Isaiah does not give any details as to when it will take place, and states that “the day of vengeance is in My heart,” indicating that God kept it to Himself. Thus, there is certainly no way for anyone to know when it is.</i>

Chapter 11

<b>“The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails well fastened are the collectors of wisdom; they are given from one shepherd” (Ecclesiastes 12:11).</b><br>“The words of the wise are like goads [<i>kadorvonot</i>]” – like a girls’ ball [<i>kadur shel banot</i>]. Just as the ball is passed from hand to hand and does not fall to the ground, so too, “not one word of it has fallen short…” (Joshua 23:14). Just as they pass the ball with their hands and it does not fall, so too, Moses received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua, and Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets, and the prophets transmitted it to the members of the Great Assembly, etc.<br>Another matter: “Like goads” – like the goad that guides the cow to plow in order to give life to its owner, so too, matters of Torah guide the heart of those who study them from the path of death to the path of life. It is called by three names, <i>dorvan</i>, <i>malmad</i>, <i>marde’a</i>; <i>malmad</i>, because it trains [<i>melamed</i>] the cow; <i>marde’a</i>, because it imparts knowledge [<i>moreh de’a</i>] to the cow; <i>dorvan</i>, because it causes understanding to dwell [<i>dayer bina</i>] in the cow, in order to plow its furrows to give life to its owner. Can these matters not be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>? If for his cow a person crafts a goad, for his evil inclination, which instigates him [to commit acts that will cause him to be banished] from this world and from the World to Come, all the more so.<br>“And like nails well fastened [<i>netuim</i>]” – the verse should have said only: “Like trees that are planted [<i>netuim</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>netuim</i> is commonly used in reference to trees, while a different verb is generally used regarding nails.</i> but you say: “And like nails well fastened”? Rather, it teaches that they have the advantage of a plant and the round heads of iron nails.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Torah has the advantages of both a plant and a nail in that one who studies it and gains a strong foundation in Torah can flourish and produce more knowledge, while the Torah he has already studied remains firmly ingrained in him like a nail hammered into a board.</i><br>Another matter: “Like nails well fastened” – just as the nail, even though you remove it from its place, its impression remains, so, anyone whose iniquities cause the Sages to extend their hand against him,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages ostracize or excommunicate him.</i> even if he repents, its impression remains. Another matter: “Like nails well fastened” – all the days of Rabbi Eliezer the people practiced in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This was because Rabbi Eliezer was ostracized due to his unwillingness to accept the determination of the majority (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 59b) (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> After Rabbi Eliezer died, they reverted to their initial practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. Thus, Rabbi Eliezer’s case is an exception to the rule stated above. Although he was ostracized, after his death the decree of ostracism was no longer operative and made no lasting mark; Rabbi Eliezer’s rulings were accepted even more so than during his life (Rabbi David Luria; see also <i>Nidda</i> 7b).</i><br>“The collectors of wisdom [<i>baalei asupot</i>]” – when are matters of Torah stated properly? It is when its possessors hear it in gatherings [<i>asupot</i>]. From where is it derived that if one heard from a person of Israel it shall be for him as though he heard from a Sage? It is as the verse states: “That I command you today” (Deuteronomy 6:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is written in singular, indicating that the Torah is given to each individual member of Israel.</i> Not as though he heard it from a Sage, but rather from the Sages, as it is stated: “The words of the wise are like goads.” Not as though he heard it from the Sages, but rather from the Sanhedrin, as it is stated: “Gather [<i>esfa</i>] to Me seventy men” (Numbers 11:16). Not as though he heard it from the Sanhedrin, but rather as though he heard it from Moses, as it is stated: “They are given from one shepherd”; this is Moses. Not as though he heard it from Moses the shepherd, but rather from the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “From one shepherd,” and “shepherd” is none other than the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Shepherd of Israel, listen” (Psalms 80:2). And “one,” is none other than the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4).<br>There we learned: A man may not go out with a spiked sandal, and not with a single [sandal] when there is no wound on his foot.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Shabbat</i> 6:2. This mishna is cited here because the verse the midrash is commenting on mentions nails.</i> How many spikes may it have?<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">In order for it to be permitted to wear the sandal on Shabbat.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan said five, corresponding to the five books of the Torah. Rabbi Dosa ben Ḥananya says: Seven, corresponding to the seven days of the week. Rabbi Ḥanina says: Nine, corresponding to the nine months of gestation. Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina said: A nail shaped like tongs is not included in the tally of the spikes.<br>Rabbi Ze’eira [said] in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Zavda:<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 6:2) the text reads: Rabbi Ze’eira asked Rabbi Abba bar Zavda.</i> ‘What is [the law] regarding placing them on a shoe for Shabbat?’ He said to him: ‘It is permitted.’ ‘What is [the law] regarding switching them?’<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Is it permitted to maintain the total number of spikes in both sandals, but to have more than the permitted number in one sandal and fewer in the other?</i> He said to him: ‘It is permitted.’ ‘What is [the law] regarding placing them one atop the other?’<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Is it permitted to place all of the spikes on one sandal and none on the other?</i> He said to him: ‘It is permitted.’ Rabbi Ḥiyya would place eleven on this side and thirteen on that side,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">He would place eleven on one side of the sandal and thirteen on the other side.</i> corresponding to the twenty-four books [of the Bible]; just as the books are twenty-four, so too, the priestly watches are twenty-four; and just as the priestly watches are twenty-four, so too, the spikes are twenty-four.

Chapter 12

<b>“More than that, my son, be careful: Making many books has no end, and much prattle is exertion of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12).</b><br>“More than that [<i>mehema</i>], my son, be careful” – [of] confusion [<i>mehuma</i>], as anyone who introduces more than [these] twenty-four books into his house introduces confusion into his house, such as the book of ben Sira and the book of ben Tigla.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Ancient works of wisdom literature.</i> “And much prattle is exertion of the flesh” – as they were given for prattle and were not given for exertion.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This is in contradistinction to the twenty-four books of the Bible, whose study requires exertion.</i>

<b>“The end of the matter, everything having been heard: Fear God and observe His commandments, for that is all of man” (Ecclesiastes 12:13).</b><br>“The end of the matter [<i>davar</i>], everything having been heard” – at the end of a person’s speech, everyone proclaims his matters: This so-and-so was upright, this so-and-so was God-fearing. They came and asked Solomon: What is the end of everything? He said to them: The end is a word [<i>davar</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">A person’s ultimate destiny is determined by what people say about him after his death.</i> Rabbi Levi said: Why is it called <i>dever</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dever</i> means plague, which is often a cause of death.</i> Because it takes [<i>daveir</i>] the good with the wicked.

That orchard was the most beloved for him of all the orchards that he had. [After some time,] ninety [vines] remained, and he would produce one hundred barrels. Eighty remained, seventy remained, sixty remained, fifty remained, forty remained, thirty remained, twenty remained, ten remained, and he would produce one hundred barrels of wine. One remained, and he would produce one hundred barrels of wine. The king said: This vine is more beloved to me than all the orchards that I have. So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: He is as beloved to me as the entire world.

Chapter 14

<b>“For every action God will bring to judgment, for every unknown, whether good or evil” (Ecclesiastes 12:14).</b><br>“For every action” – Rabbi would interpret these verses, and when he would arrive at one of these six verses, he would weep. These are they: “For behold the Former of mountains, [and Creator of wind, who tells man what is his conversation]” (Amos 4:13). Even matters that do not have substance or sin are written for Him in His ledger. Who writes them? “He who renders dawn, darkness…[the Lord, God of hosts, is His name]” (Amos 4:13).<br>In addition: “Seek the Lord, all you humble of the earth, [who have performed His judgment; seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you shall be hidden in the day of the Lord’s anger]” (Zephaniah 2:3).<br>[In addition:] “Hate evil, and love good, [and display justice at the gate; perhaps the Lord, God of hosts, will grant favor to the remnant of Joseph]” (Amos 5:15).<br>And this verse: “For every action God [will bring to judgment, for every unknown, whether good or evil].” “Without knowledge, even the soul is no good” (Proverbs 19:2) – Rabbi Beivai said: [This is likened] to one who was accustomed to engage in relations [with his wife] at sunrise. He forgot<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">He forgot that the expected time had come for his wife to menstruate, and he was therefore obliged to refrain from engaging in marital relations with her (see <i>Nidda</i> 63b).</i> and engaged in relations before sunrise.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">His wife menstruated at that time, and they unwittingly violated the prohibition to engage in relations while she was menstruating.</i> If he did so without knowledge, it is not good,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Even if he forgot that he was supposed to separate from her, he bears responsibility.

Furthermore, “he who hastens with his feet sins” (Proverbs 19:2).<br>Rabbi Yoḥanan interpreted the verse regarding Shabbat.
