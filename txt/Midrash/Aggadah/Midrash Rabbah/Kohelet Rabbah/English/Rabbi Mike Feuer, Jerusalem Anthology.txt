…R’ Berachia said in the name of R’ Yitzchak the last redeemer will be just as the first. Just as it says of the first redeemer “So Moses took his wife and his sons, mounted them upon the donkey…” (Shemot 4:20) so too the last redeemer, as it says “…humble, and riding a donkey…” (Zechariah 9:9) Just as the first redeemer brought down the manna, as it says “Behold! I am going to rain down for you bread from heaven…” (Shemot 16:4) so too the last redeemer will bring down manna, as it says “May there be an abundance of grain in the land…” (Tehillim 72:16) Just as the first redeemer brought up the well, so too the last redeemer will bring up the water, as it says “…and a spring will issue from the house of the Lord and will water the valley of Shittim…” (Yoel 4:18)

R’ Yehoshua ben Levi explained the verse as referring to the Holy Temple: The prophet said to Israel “And remember your Creator in the days of your youth (bachurotecha)…” (Kohelet 12:1) Remember your Creator while your youth (bachureichem) lasts. While the covenant with the priests lasts, as it says “And I did choose (u’vachor) him from all the tribes of Israel…” (Shmuel I 2:28) While the covenant with the Levites lasts, as it says “For the Lord, your God, has chosen (bachar) him out of all your tribes…” (Devarim 18:5) While the covenant with Jerusalem lasts, as it says ““…the city which I have chosen (bacharti).” (Melachim I 11:13) While the kingship of David lasts, as it says “And He chose (v’yivchar) His servant David…” (Tehillim 78:70) While the Holy Temple is still standing, as it says “I have chosen (bacharti) and consecrated this House…” (Divre HaYamim II 7:16) As long as you exist, as it is written “…the Lord your God has chosen you…” (Devarim 7:6)
