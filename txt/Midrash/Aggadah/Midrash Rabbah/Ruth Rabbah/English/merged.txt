<b>“It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem of Judah went to reside in the field of Moav, he, his wife, and his two sons” (Ruth 1:1).</b><br>“It was during the days when the judges judged” – Rabbi Yoḥanan began and said: “Hear My people and I will speak; [Israel, and I will forewarn you]” (Psalms 50:7). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One forewarns only one who can hear it. Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Simon said: In the past they were called Israel like all other nations: “Savta, Rama, and Savtekha” (Genesis 10:7);<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These are the names of nations listed in Genesis, chap. 10.</i> from here forward, they are called only My people. “Hear My people and I will speak” – from where did you merit to be called My people? From “and I will speak” – from what you spoke before Me at Sinai and said: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Hear My people” – [what I have said] in the past; “and I will speak” – in the future. “Hear My people” – in this world; “and I will speak” – in the World to Come. So I will have a response to the angels of the nations of the world who are destined to accuse them before Me and say: ‘Master of the universe, these worship idols and those worship idols, these engaged in forbidden sexual relations and those engaged in forbidden sexual relations, these spilled blood and those spilled blood, and these are going down to the Garden of Eden and those are going down to Gehenna?’<br>At that time, the advocate of Israel is silenced. That is what you say: “At that time Mikhael will stand” (Daniel 12:1). Is there sitting on high? Did Rabbi Ḥanina not say: There is no sitting on high, as it is written: “I approached one of those standing [<i>kamaya</i>]” (Daniel 7:16). What is this language <i>kamaya</i>? Standing [<i>kayama</i>], as it is written: “Seraphim stood above Him” (Isaiah 6:2), and it is written: “The entire host of heaven standing in His presence on His right hand and on His left” (see I Kings 22:19). And you say “will stand”?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since angels always stand, what does it mean that the angel Mikhael will stand at that moment?</i> [Rather,] what is “will stand”? It is stand silent, as you say: “Shall I wait, because they do not speak, <because they stand silent [<i>amdu</i>] and do not answer>?” (Job 32:16).<br>The Holy One blessed be He says to him: ‘Do you stand silent and not advocate on behalf of My children? By your life, I will speak in support of their righteousness and rescue My children.’ What righteousness? Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan, one says: Due to the righteousness that you established My world because you accepted My Torah, as had you not accepted My Torah, I would have restored it [the world] to emptiness and disorder, as Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: “Earth and all its inhabitants dissolve, [I set its pillars, selah]” (Psalms 75:4). The world would have already dissolved, had Israel not stood before Mount Sinai…<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to a midrash that appears in <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba</i> 1:9: “If Israel had not stood on Mount Sinai and said: ‘Everything that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will heed’ (Exodus 24:7), the world would have dissolved and returned to emptiness and disorder.” The midrash there then continues as it does here.</i> And who established the world? “I [<i>anokhi</i>] set its pillars” (Psalms 75:4). Due to the merit of <i>anokhi</i>, “I set its pillars, selah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Anokhi</i> is the first word of the Ten Commandments. In other words, due to the merit of Israel’s future acceptance of the Ten Commandments and the entire Torah, God established the foundations of the world.</i> One said: Due to the righteousness you did for yourselves in accepting My Torah, as had you not done so, I would have eliminated you from among the nations.<br> “God; I am your God” (Psalms 50:7) – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is sufficient for you that I am your patron. Reish Lakish said: Although I am your patron, how does My patronage help at trial?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is responding to the repetition in the verse: “God; I am your God.” God [<i>Elohim</i>] represents the attribute of justice, and the verse thus presents a tension between God being strictly just and God being particularly Israel’s God, i.e., their patron.</i><br>Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai taught: I am the God for all humankind, but I have designated My name only upon My people Israel. I am not called the God of all the nations, but rather, the God of Israel. “God [<i>Elohim</i>]; I am your God” – Rabbi Yudan interpreted the verse in reference to Moses: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Even though I called you “god to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:1), “I am your God” – I am above you.’ Rabbi Abba bar Yudan interpreted the verse in reference to Israel: Although I called you god, as it is stated: “I said you are godlike [<i>elohim</i>]” (Psalms 82:6), “I am your God” – know that I am above you. The Rabbis interpreted the verse in reference to judges: Even though I called you <i>elohim</i>, as it is stated: “Do not curse <i>elohim</i>” (Exodus 22:27), know that I am above you. Then He said to Israel: ‘I accorded honor to the judges and called them <i>elohim</i>, and they demean them. Woe unto a generation that judges their judges.’
“It was during the days when the judges judged.” “Indolence casts into a deep sleep” (Proverbs 19:15) – because Israel were indolent in paying their respects to Joshua; that is what is written: “They buried him on the border of his inheritance…north of Mount Gaash” (Joshua 24:30). Rabbi Berekhya said: We reviewed the entire Bible and did not find a place named Gaash. What is Mount Gaash? It is because Israel was negligent [<i>nitgaashu</i>] in doing kindness for Joshua. At that time, the Land of Israel was being divided [among the tribes], and its division [i.e., the land] was too beloved to them. Israel were engaged in their labor; this one was occupied in his field, this one was occupied in his vineyard, this one was occupied in his olives, and this one was occupied with his planks [for construction]. “A deceitful soul will starve” (Proverbs 19:15)<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This is the conclusion of the verse: “Indolence casts into a deep sleep, and the deceitful soul will starve” (Proverbs 19:5).</i> – Israel was negligent [<i>nitgaashu</i>] in doing kindness for Joshua, and the Holy One blessed be He sought to bring an earthquake upon the world, upon all its inhabitants, as you say: “The earth shook [<i>vatigash</i>] and quaked” (Psalms 18:8). “A deceitful soul will starve” – because they were deceitful to the Holy One blessed be He: Some of them worshipped idols. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He starved them of the divine spirit, as it is stated: “The word of the Lord was rare in those days” (I Samuel 3:1).<br>Another interpretation: “Indolence casts into a deep sleep” (Proverbs 19:15) – due to the fact that Israel was indolent about repenting during the days of Elijah, “casts into [<i>tapil</i>] a deep sleep” – prophecy proliferated. Proliferated? But you said <i>tapil.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tapil</i> literally means ‘cause to fall’ or ‘cause to decline.’</i> It is as you say: The price of fruit has fallen.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Because the supply has increased, the price has declined.</i> Rabbi Simon said: Like a person who says to another: ‘Here is a sack, here is a <i>sela</i> coin, arise and eat.’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, prophecy was readily available, like buying produce.</i> As Rabbi Derosa said: Six hundred thousand prophets arose for Israel during the days of Elijah; Rabbi Yaakov said: One million two hundred thousand. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Between Gevat and Antipatris<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Gevat was at the southern border of Roman Judea and Antipatris at its northern border. This expression is a way of saying ‘throughout Judea.’</i> there were six hundred thousand towns, and there were no towns more corrupt that Beit El and Jericho; Jericho, because Joshua cursed it (see Joshua 6:26), and Beit El, because Yerovam’s calves were situated there (see I Kings 12:28–29). It is stated: “The disciples of the prophets who were in Beit El went out to Elisha” (II Kings 2:3). “Prophets” – prophets are no fewer than two.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If in this corrupt city there were at least two prophets, presumably there were more elsewhere.</i> Why were their prophecies not publicized? It is because they served no purpose for future generations. On this basis, say: Any prophecy that served no purpose for future generations was not publicized. But in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will come and bring them with Him, and their prophecy will be publicized; that is what is written: “The Lord my God will come, all the holy ones with You” (Zechariah 14:5).<br>“A deceitful soul will starve” (Proverbs 19:15) – because they would deceive the Holy One blessed be He: Some of them worshipped idols and some of them worshipped the Holy One blessed be He. This is what Elijah said to them: “How long will you waver between the two opinions” (I Kings 18:21)? “Will starve” – the Holy One blessed be He starved them during the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “By the life of the Lord [. . .] before whom I have stood [there will not be dew or rain during these years]” (I Kings 17:1). Another interpretation: “Indolence casts into a deep sleep” (Proverbs 19:15) – because Israel were indolent about repenting during the days of the judges, a deep sleep will be cast upon them. “A deceitful soul will starve” – because they deceived the Holy One blessed be He with some of them worshipping idols and some of them worshipping the Holy One blessed be He, the Holy One blessed be He starved them with a famine during the days of their judges.
“It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine.” “The path of a man is erratic [<i>hafakhpakh</i>] and strange, [but as for the pure, his conduct is upright]” (Proverbs 21:8) – this is the wicked Esau [Rome] who would erratically [<i>mithapekh</i>] assail Israel with [evil] decrees. ‘Did you steal?’ ‘We did not steal.’ ‘Did you kill?’ ‘We did not kill.’ ‘You did not steal, who stole with you?’ ‘You did not kill, who killed with you?’ They would confiscate from them and impose monetary penalties upon them: Bring your property tax, bring your head tax, bring your state tax. “Man” – this is the wicked Esau, as it is stated: “Esau was a man who knew hunting” (Genesis 25:27). “And strange” – as he made himself estranged from circumcision and estranged from mitzvot. “Pure” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, who treats him in upright ways and gives him his reward in this world, like a laborer who performs labor in good faith with his employer.<br>Another interpretation: “The path of a man [<i>ish</i>] is erratic [<i>hafakhpakh</i>] and strange” (Proverbs 21:8) – these are the nations of the world who constantly [<i>mehapekhin</i>] assail Israel with [evil] decrees. “A man” – they who descend from Noah, who was called “a man” (Genesis 6:9); “and strange” – as they worship idols. “But as for the pure, his conduct is upright [<i>yashar</i>]” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, who treats them in an upright manner. Rabbi Aḥa said: “The path…is erratic” – this is Israel, as it is stated: “As they are an erratic generation” (Deuteronomy 32:20). “A man [<i>ish</i>]” – “The men [<i>ish</i>] of Israel took an oath” (Judges 21:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">It is difficult to ascertain what is meant by this reference. Perhaps the midrash seeks to connect “the path of a man is erratic” to the tragic events surrounding the concubine of Giva recounted in Judges, chaps. 19–21.</i> “And strange [<i>vazar</i>]” – because they estranged themselves from the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “They betrayed the Lord, as they begot foreign [<i>zarim</i>] children” (Hosea 5:7). “But as for the pure” – that is the Holy One blessed be He, who conducts Himself with uprightness in this world and gives them a complete reward in the future, like a craftsman who performs his labor in good faith with his employer. At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: My children are recalcitrant; to eliminate them is impossible, to return them to Egypt is impossible, to exchange them with another nation, I am unable. What shall I do to them? I will afflict them with suffering and will refine them with famine during the days when the judges judged. That is what is written: “It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land.”
Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon began: “He said: I will hide My face from them” (Deuteronomy 32:20). [It is analogous] to a king’s son who went out to the marketplace and struck but was not hit, demeaned but was not demeaned, and he went running up to his father. He [his father] said to him: ‘What do you think, that you are honored because your own honor? You are honored only because of my honor.’ What did his father do? He repudiated him, and no one paid any attention to him [the son]. So, when Israel departed from Egypt, dread of them fell over all the nations, as it is stated: “Peoples heard, they were agitated; terror gripped the dwellers of Philistia. Then the chieftains of Edom were confounded, trembling gripped the powers of Moav, all the dwellers of Canaan dissolved. Dread and fear fall upon them” (Exodus 15:14–16). When they began transgressing and performing evil deeds, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: What do you think, that you are honored due to your own honor? You are honored only due to My honor. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He repudiated them a bit, and the Amalekites came and confronted Israel, as it is stated: “Amalek came and waged war with Israel in Refidim” (Exodus 17:8). In addition, the Canaanites came and confronted Israel, as it is stated: “The Canaanites heard […and waged war with Israel]” (Numbers 21:1).<br>The Holy One blessed be He said: You have no faithfulness, you are not true to your word, you are erratic, as it is stated; “As they are an erratic generation, children in whom there is no trust [<i>emun</i>]” (Deuteronomy 32:20). It is written <i>amen</i>. When the prophets would bless them, not one of them began to say amen until Jeremiah said it, as it is stated: “I responded, saying: Amen, Lord” (Jeremiah 11:5). At that time, the Holy One blessed be He said: You are erratic, you are bothersome, you are recalcitrant; to eliminate them is impossible, to return them to Egypt is impossible, to exchange them with another nation is impossible…
Rabbi Neḥemya began: “Israel, your prophets have been like foxes in ruins. [You did not go up into the breaches or build a fence for the house of Israel, to stand in battle on the day of the Lord]” (Ezekiel 13:4–5)<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The prophets addressed by Ezekiel are false prophets, “foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing” (Ezekiel 13:3).</i> – just as this fox anticipates in the ruins so that when he sees people he will know to which direction to flee, so <your prophets> have been like foxes in the ruins. You did not go up into the breaches like Moses. To whom was Moses our master similar? It is to a faithful shepherd for whom a fence fell just before dark. He arose and fenced on three sides, but a breach remained, and he did not have time to fence it. He stood in the breach; a lion came, and he stood against it. A wolf came, and he stood against it. You [the prophets], however, did not stand in the breach like Moses, for if you had gone up into the breaches like Moses, you would have been able to stand in battle on the day of God’s wrath.
<b>“The name of the man was Elimelekh, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Maḥlon and Khilyon, Efratites of Bethlehem in Judah. They came to the field of Moav, and they were there” (Ruth 1:2).</b><br>“The name of the man was Elimelekh” – once trouble came, you went and abandoned them. “A man from Bethlehem of Judah” (Ruth 1:1) – that is what the verse says: “Our oxen [<i>alufeinu</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>aluf</i> can also mean leader. The midrash is reading the verse to refer to Elimelekh as a leader of the people.</i> are laden [<i>mesubalim</i>]; [there is no breach, none have gone out; there is no outcry in our plazas]” (Psalms 144:14). Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is not written here: Bearing [<i>sovelim</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As in, the leaders bear the burdens of the people.</i> but rather: “Are laden [<i>mesubalim</i>].” When the lesser bear the burden [<i>sovelim</i>] of the greater, “there is no breach [<i>peretz</i>]” – there is no outbreak [<i>pirtza</i>] of plague, as you say: “A plague broke out among them” (Psalms 106:29). “None have gone out [<i>yotzet</i>]” (Psalms 144:14) – there is no emergence of a plague, as you say: “Fire emerged [<i>vatetzeh</i>] from before the Lord” (Leviticus 9:24). “There is no outcry” (Psalms 144:14) – there is no outcry of plague, as you say: “All Israel that were around them fled at their cry” (Numbers 16:34).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This verse appears in the story of Koraḥ, which concludes with a plague (Numbers 16–17).</i> Reish Lakish reverses the order of the verse: When the greater tolerate<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">He reads <i>alufeinu mesubalim</i> to mean, ‘our leaders bear [tolerate].’</i> the lesser there is no breach of exile, as it is written: “Through breaches they will go out” (Amos 4:3). “None have gone out” – to exile, as it is written: “Cast them from before Me and let them go out” (Jeremiah 15:1). “There is no outcry” – of exile, as it is written: “Behold the sound of the outcry of the daughter of my people” (Jeremiah 8:19), and it is written: “And the outcry of Jerusalem has risen up” (Jeremiah 14:2). Rabbi Luliani said: When the lesser heed the greater, but the greater do not bear the burden of the lesser, about them Scripture states: “The Lord will enter into judgment” (Isaiah 3:14). “The name of the man was Elimelekh” – when trouble came, you [Elimelekh] went and abandoned them: “A man from Bethlehem of Judah went” (Ruth 1:1).
Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great, and Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Elazar: This midrash came up with us from the Exile:<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">From Babylonia. Presumably, this is a way of stating that it is an ancient tradition.</i> Any place that “It was [<i>vayhi</i>]” is stated, [it alludes to] trouble. Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great: Any place that <i>“</i>It was<i></i> [<i>vayhi</i>]”<i></i> is stated, it can serve [to allude to] either trouble or joy. If it is trouble, there is none like it. If it is joy, there is none like it. Rabbi Shmuel said: There are five [instances of] “during the days of [<i>bimei</i>].” “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of [<i>bimei</i>] Amrafel” (Genesis 14:1) – what was the trouble there? They waged a war. [It is analogous] to the friend of a king who was located in a certain province. Because of him, the king took care of the province. One time, barbarians came and beset him [the king’s friend]. They say: Woe for us, the king will no longer care for the province as he had done. Likewise, the entire world was created only due to the merit of Abraham our patriarch; that is what is written: “They turned back and came to Ein Mishpat,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Ein Mishpat literally means ‘eye of justice’.</i> which is [<i>hi</i>] Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). Rabbi Aḥa said: They came to beset the eyeball of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham.</i> The eye that overcame the attribute of justice in the world you seek to blind?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is rhetorically addressing the kings that attacked Abraham.</i> “Which is [<i>hi</i>] Kadesh” – Rabbi Aḥa said: <i>Hu</i> Kadesh.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>hi</i>, meaning ‘which is,’ is spelled with a vav as the middle letter, which could be read as the masculine <i>hu</i>. The midrash is reading <i>hi Kadesh</i> as <i>hu kidesh</i>, he sanctified.</i> He [Abraham] sanctified [<i>kidesh</i>] the name of the Holy One blessed be He in the fiery furnace.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanḥuma</i>,<i> Lekh Lekha</i> 6.</i> When everyone saw that all the kings came to beset him, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]; that is, “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the reign of Amrafel.”<br>“It was during the days of Aḥaz” (Isaiah 7:1) – what was the trouble there? “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11) – [it is analogous] to the son of a king who had a tutor who sought to kill him. He [the tutor] said: If I kill him, I will be condemned to death by the king; instead, I will withhold his wet nurse from him, and he will die on his own. So did Aḥaz say: If there are no kids, there are no rams, and if there are no rams there is no flock, and if there is no flock there is no shepherd. So Aḥaz thought to say: If there are no children, there are no adults, and if there are no adults there are no students, if there are no students there are no scholars, if there are no scholars, there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One blessed be He, as it were, cannot rest His Divine Presence in the world. Therefore, I will seize all the synagogues and study halls. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16).<br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he seized [<i>aḥaz</i>] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Avin: Isaiah said: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as difficult for Israel as that time, as it is stated: “I will conceal My face” (Deuteronomy 31:18) – in this world. But from that moment, “I hoped for Him” (Isaiah 8:17), as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). Was it [this verse] fulfilled for him [Isaiah]? “Behold, I and the children whom the Lord gave me” (Isaiah 8:18) – were they his [Isaiah’s] children? Were they not his students? It teaches that they were as dear to him as his sons. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]: that is, “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥaz.”<br>“It was during the days of Yehoyakim” (Jeremiah 1:3) – what was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder, and the heavens, and their light is not” (Jeremiah 4:23) – [it is analogous] to a king who sent a proclamation to a province. What did the residents of the province do to it? They took it, ripped it, and burned it in fire. They said: Woe to us when the king becomes aware of these matters. That is what is written: “It was, as Yehudi would read three columns or four” (Jeremiah 36:23) – three or four verses. When he reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5),<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This is the fifth verse of the first chapter of Lamentations.</i> immediately: “He would cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace, until the end of the scroll, upon the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). Once they saw that it was so, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]; that is, “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Yehoyakim.”<br>“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1) – what was the trouble there? [It was] “to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews” (Esther 3:13). [It is analogous] to a king who entered a vineyard and three enemies beset him: The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third sought to uproot all the vines. Likewise, the wicked Pharaoh begin picking the unripe grapes; that is what is written: “[Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying:] Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile” (Exodus 1:22).<br>The wicked Nebuchadnezzar began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “[He exiled Yehoyakhin.…] and the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:15–16). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda said: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths; Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All of them were one thousand. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the notables. Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: These are the Torah scholars.<br>Haman the wicked sought to uproot the entire egg;<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Egg, in the sense of the very origins of Israel.</i> [as] they say buy [the hen] with the egg<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A aphorism meaning that he sought to complete the task, leaving no future.</i> – “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). When they saw that it was so, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]; “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh.”<br>“It was during the days when the judges judged” (Ruth 1:1) – what was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1) – [it is analogous] to a province that owed a tax to the king. What did the king do? He sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do? They took him, struck him, and extracted it [the money] from him. They said: What he sought to do to us we did to him. Likewise, during the days when the judges judged, an Israelite person would worship idols, and a judge would seek to bring him to trial, and he would come and flog the judge. He would say: What he sought to do to me, I did to him. Woe unto a generation whose judges are judged;<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is reading the verse to mean that it was in the days that the judges were judged, i.e. punished.</i> that is, “It was during the days when the judges judged.”<br>Shimon bar Rabbi Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere that it [“it was,” <i>vayhi</i>]<i></i> is stated, [it alludes to] trouble or to joy; if trouble, there is no trouble like it, if joy, there is no joy like it in the world. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman came and suggested a [different] distinction: Everywhere that it says, “it was [<i>vayhi</i>],” [it alludes to] trouble, everywhere that it says “it will be [<i>vehaya</i>],” joy.<br>But it is written: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [<i>vayhi</i>] light.” He said to them: Even that is not light of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. By the light that was created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When He perceived that the wicked were destined to appear, like the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and the generation of the Dispersion,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">After the Tower of Babel.</i> and like the people of Sodom, He took it [the light] away. That is what is written: “From the wicked their light is withheld” (Job 38:15). He sequestered it for the righteous in the future, as it is stated: “Light is sown for the righteous” (Psalms 97:11).<br>They objected to him: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as the heavens are destined to wither; that is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke” (Isaiah 51:6).<br>They objected to him: Is it not written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening and it was morning, a second day.… third.… fourth.… fifth.… sixth” (Genesis 1:8–31). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires action, e.g., it is necessary to sweeten mustard, lupines must be sweetened, and wheat requires grinding.<br>But it is written: “The Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it is written: “For they placed me in the pit” (Genesis 40:15). But it is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] on the day that Moses completed [assembling the Tabernacle]” (Numbers 7:1).

Chapter 1

<b>“It was in the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land. A man of Bethlehem of Judah went to reside in the fields of Moav; he, his wife, and his two sons” (Ruth 1:1).</b><br>“It was in the days when the judges judged [<i>shefot hashofetim</i>].” Woe to the generation that judged their judges, and woe to the generation whose judges require judgment, as it is stated: “They also did not heed their judges” (Judges 2:17). Who were they [those judges]? Rav said: They were Barak and Deborah. Rabbi Yehosha ben Levi said: They were Shamgar and Ehud. Rav Huna said: They were Deborah, Barak, and Yael. <i>Shefot</i> – one, <i>shofetim</i> – two, <i>hashofetim</i> – three.
Rabbi asked Rabbi Betzalel: What is that which is written: “For their mother has committed harlotry” (Hosea 2:7)? Is it possible that Sarah our matriarch was a harlot? He said to him: ‘Heaven forbid; rather, when are matters of Torah rendered contemptible before the common people? It is when their owners debase them.’ Rabbi Yaakov bar Avdimi came and rendered it a [midrashic] dictum: When do matters of Torah become like harlots before the common people? When their owners debase them. Rabbi Yoḥanan derives it from here: “The poor man’s [<i>misken</i>] wisdom is contemptible” (Ecclesiastes 9:16). Was the wisdom of Rabbi Akiva, who was poor, contemptible? Rather, what is a <i>misken</i>? It is one who is contemptible in his words, like an elder who sits and teaches: “You shall not pervert justice” (Deuteronomy 16:19), and he perverts justice; “you shall not show partiality” (Deuteronomy 16:19), and he shows partiality; “you shall not afflict any widow or orphan” (Exodus 22:21) and he afflicts them. Samson followed his eyes, as it is stated: “Take her for me, as she is fitting in my eyes” (Judges 14:3). Gideon worshipped idols, as it is stated: “Gideon made it into an ephod” (Judges 8:27). Woe to a judge who shows partiality in judgment.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “You shall not do injustice in judgment” (Leviticus 19:15) – this teaches that a judge who corrupts judgment is called by five names: unjust, hated, detestable, proscribed, abomination. The Holy One blessed be He calls him five: wicked, blasphemer, violator of the covenant, one who infuriates, and defiant. He causes five results in the world; he defiles the land, desecrates the Name, expels the Divine Presence, causes Israel to fall by the sword, and exiles them from their land. Woe to the generation that is corrupted in this way.<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “You shall not do injustice in judgment [in measure, in weight, or in volume]” (Leviticus 19:35) – in a judicial ruling. If it is about judicial rulings, it is already stated about judicial rulings!<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse cited above, Leviticus 19:15: “You shall not do injustice in judgment.”</i> If so, why is it stated, “…in judgment in measure [in weight, or in volume]”? It teaches that one who measures is called a judge, and if he falsifies, he is called five names and he causes five results. Woe is the generation whose measures are false, as Rabbi Benaya said in the name of Rabbi Huna: If you see a generation whose measures are false, a kingdom comes and besets that generation. What is the reason? “Scales of deceit are an abomination to the Lord” (Proverbs 11:1), and it is written: “Pride comes, shame comes” (Proverbs 11:2).<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Abba: It is written: “Will I find merit with scales of wickedness, [or with a pouch of deceitful weights?]” (Micah 6:11). Is it possible that a generation whose measures are false will find merit? Rather, “in a pouch of deceitful weights.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">They will be left with a purse filled with counterfeit coins. The midrash is reading the second half of the verse, “or with a pouch of deceitful weights” not as the continuation of the rhetorical question, but as the answer to “Will I find merit with scales of wickedness?”</i> Rabbi Levi said: Moses indeed alluded this to Israel in the Torah: “You shall not have in your purse [alternate weights]” (Deuteronomy 25:13); “you shall not have in your house alternate measures” (Deuteronomy 25:13), and if he did so, ultimately, a kingdom will come and beset them, as it is written: “As it is an abomination to the Lord anyone who does [<i>oseh</i>] so, anyone who does [<i>oseh</i>] injustice” (Deuteronomy 25:16), and it is written: “Remember what Amalek did [<i>asah</i>] to you, on the way, as you were leaving Egypt” (Deuteronomy 25:17).
Rabbi said: Blessings<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In the sense of good deeds.</i> bring blessings upon their purveyors; curses<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In the sense of evil deeds.</i> bring curses upon their purveyors. Blessings bring blessings upon their purveyors, as it is written: “A whole and just weight shall be [yours]” (Deuteronomy 25:15), and if you do so: “shall be yours” (Deuteronomy 25:15). Curses bring curses upon their purveyors, as it is written: “You shall not have in your purse different weights, large and small” (Deuteronomy 25:13), and if you do so, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You sought to use large and small? By your life, that wicked one [who uses corrupt weights] will not manage to possess even something small,’ as it is written: “You shall not have in your purse.” Similarly, “you shall not make with Me [gods of silver and gods of gold]” (Exodus 20:20). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You sought to make for Me “gods of silver and gods of gold” – by your life, that wicked one will not manage to make even one of wood,’ as it is written: “You shall not make for yourselves” (Exodus 20:20).
“There was a famine in the land.” Ten famines came to the world. One during the days of Adam; one during the days of Lemekh; one during the days of Abraham; one during the days of Isaac; one during the days of Jacob; one during the days of Elijah; one during the days of Elisha; one during the days of David; one during the days when the judges judged; and one that is yet progressing and coming to the world.<br>One during the days of Adam, as it is stated: “Accursed is the ground because of you” (Genesis 3:17); one during the days of Lemekh, as it is stated: “From the ground that the Lord had cursed” (Genesis 5:29); one during the days of Abraham, as it is stated: “There was famine in the land and Abram descended to Egypt” (Genesis 12:10); one during the days of Isaac: “There was a famine in the land, beside the first famine” (Genesis 26:1); one during the days of Jacob, as it is stated: “For these two years there has been famine in the land” (Genesis 45:6); one during the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “There will not be dew or rain these years, except by my word” (I Kings 17:1); one during the days of Elisha, as it is stated: “There was a great famine in Samaria” (II Kings 6:25); one during the days of David, as it is stated: “There was a famine during the days of David, three years” (II Samuel 21:1); one during the days when the judges judged, as it is stated: “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1); and one that is advancing upon the world, as it is written: “I will send famine in the land, not famine for bread, not thirst for water” (Amos 8:11).<br>Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: It would have been appropriate for the main manifestation of them<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The years of famine during the days of David.</i> to have been during the days of Saul, and it was not appropriate for them to have been during the days of David. [But] because Saul was an offshoot of a sycamore tree,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The sycamore tree is frail.</i> and would have been unable to withstand it, the Holy One blessed be He transferred it and brought it to David, who is the offshoot of an olive tree<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The olive tree is sturdy.</i> and [he] was able to withstand it. A parable says: Shila sinned and Yoḥana<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Generic names of that period.</i> pays for it? So, all of them did not come upon lowly people, but rather upon mighty people who could withstand them. Rabbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: [It is analogous] to a glazier who had a basket filled with cups of cut glass. When he sought to hang his basket, he would bring a peg, hammer it [into the wall,] and then hang his basket. So, all of them did not come upon lowly people, but rather to mighty people. Rabbi Berekhya would read in reference to them:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">David’s generation.</i> “He gives strength to the weary” (Isaiah 40:29).<br>Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: Two [famines]<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">That of Lemekh occurred while Adam was still alive.</i> came during the days of Adam.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In the parallel text of this midrash found in <i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 25:3 it says ‘Abraham’ instead of ‘Adam.’</i> Rav Huna in the name of Rav Aḥa: One was during the days of Abraham, and one was during the days of Lemekh. The famine that was during the days of Elijah was due to a drought. One year it produced [a harvest] and the other year it did not produce. But the famine during the days of Elisha was due to [economic] panic, as it is stated: “Until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty of silver” (II Kings 6:25). [Regarding] the famine that came during the days that the judges judged, Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Dosa: They were forty-two <i>se’a</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">A measure of dry volume roughly equivalent to 8 liters.</i> and they became forty-one <i>se’a</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the amount of produce that could be purchased for one <i>sela</i>. Some commentators suggest that the text should be read: they were [sold] at a rate of two <i>se’a</i> [per <i>sela</i>] and became one <i>se’a</i> [per <i>sela</i>]. See Etz Yosef.</i> But is it not taught: A person may not depart to outside the Land of Israel until two <i>se’a</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Of wheat.</i> are bought for a shekel?<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the biblical shekel, which is the equivalent of the rabbinic <i>sela</i>.</i> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: When is that so? It is when one cannot find anything [else] to buy. But if he can find [other food] to buy, even [at] one <i>se’a</i> for a shekel, a Jew may not leave the Land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Elimelekh was punished because his decision to leave the Land of Israel was not justified.</i> But is it not taught: During a time of pestilence, a time of war, gather everyone inside, but during a time of famine, scatter? Why was Elimelekh punished? It is because he sank the hearts of Israel.<br>[It is analogous] to a prominent person who lived in a province, and the residents of the province would depend upon him, and would say that if drought years would come, he could provide food for the province for ten years. When a drought year came, his maidservant went out, and went into the market with her basket in her hand. The residents of the province said: This is the one who we relied upon, that if there would be a drought he could support us for ten years? His maidservant is standing in the market with her basket in her hand! So, Elimelekh was one of the prominent residents of the province, and one of the leaders of the generation. When the years of famine arrived, he said: ‘Now, all Israel will come around to my door, this one with his basket and that one with his basket.’ He arose and fled from them; that is what is written: “A man of Bethlehem of Judah went.”
“A man…went” – Like a stump [with nothing]? Rather, come and see how much more the Holy One blessed be He appreciates entering the Land of Israel than leaving it. Below, it is written: “Their horses…their mules…their camels” (Ezra 2: 66–67), but here it is written: “A man…went” – like a stump. As opposed to below [the exiled Judeans returning to the land, as described in Ezra], because they were departing from the Land to outside the Land, the verse did not attribute their property to them. “A man…went” – like a stump.<br>“To reside in the fields of Moav” – Rabbi Levi said: Every place<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">It does not mean every place literally; depending on the context, there are places where field means city, e.g. when the field is mentioned as a place of residence.</i> you find field, it is a city; [where you find] city, it is a province; province, it is a country. Field, it is a city – as it is stated: “Go to Anatot, to your fields” (I Kings 2:26). City – it is a province, as it is stated: “Pass in the midst of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>medina</i> can refer to either a large city or a province.</i> (Ezekiel 9:4). Province – it is a country, as it is stated: “One hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (Esther 1:1).<br>“He, his wife, and his two sons” – He was primary; his wife, secondary to him; and his sons, secondary to them.

Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi and Rabbi Ḥama, father of Rabbi Hosea in the name of Rabbi: Chronicles was given only to be expounded;<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash will continue by citing and expounding three verses from Chronicles.

Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Her occupation was with perfumes.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Perfumed branches, including flax branches.</i> “To the house of Ashbea” (I Chronicles 4:21), as the spies took an oath [<i>nishbe’u</i>] to her, as it is stated: “Now, please, take an oath to me by the Lord” (Joshua 2:12). “And Yokim” (I Chronicles 4:22), as they fulfilled [<i>shekiyemu</i>] the oath to her; that is what is written: “The young spies came, [and took out Rahab…and they took out all her families…]” (Joshua 6:23). Why does the verse state: “And they took out all her families”? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: Even if her family consisted of two hundred people, and they went and joined two hundred other families, they would all be rescued, thanks to her. All her family is not stated, but rather “all her families.” “And the people of Kozeva” (I Chronicles 4:22), as she deceived [<i>kizva</i>] the king of Jericho, as it is stated: “She said: Yes, the men came to me…” (Joshua 2:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">She continued: “I do not know from where they were, they fled, and I do not know where they went.”</i> “And Yoash” (I Chronicles 4:22), because she despaired [<i>nitya’asha</i>] of life.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">She endangered her life to protect the spies.</i> “And Saraf” (I Chronicles 4:22), as she prepared herself to be burned [<i>lisrufin</i>]. “Who had dominion over Moav [<i>ba’alu leMoav</i>]” (I Chronicles 4:22), she came [<i>ba’a</i>] and cleaved to Israel, and her actions arose [<i>alu</i>] to her Father [<i>le’aviha</i>] in Heaven. “And Yashuvi Laḥem ” (I Chronicles 4:22), she cleaved to Israel, who received the Torah in which it is written: “Come eat of my bread [<i>laḥmi</i>]” (Proverbs 9:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Torah is likened to bread; just as bread provides physical sustenance, Torah provides spiritual sustenance.</i> “And the matters are ancient” (I Chronicles 4:22) – Rabbi Aivu and Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon say: These matters are vague here, but explicit elsewhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">In the book of Joshua.</i><br>“They are the potters” (I Chronicles 4:23) – these are the spies; that is what is written: “Joshua bin Nun sent from Shittim [two men, spies, secretly [<i>ḥeresh</i>], saying…]” (Joshua 2:1).

How did she know that they would return in three days?<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">She advised the spies to hide in the mountains for three days, until the pursuers would cease their pursuit and return to the city (Joshua 2:16).</i> From here [it may be derived that] the Divine Spirit rested upon her. “They dwelt there with the king in his service” (I Chronicles 4:23) – from here they said: Ten priests, prophets, emerged from Raḥav the prostitute: Jeremiah, Ḥilkiya, Seraya, Maḥseya, Ḥanamel; Shalum, Barukh, Neriya, Ezekiel, Buzi. Some say: Ḥulda the prophetess, too, was among the descendants of Raḥav the prostitute.
Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani interpreted the verses as referring to David: “The sons of Shela, son of Judah: Er, father of [<i>avi</i>] Lekha” (I Chronicles 4:21) – the President of the Court [<i>Av Beit Din</i>] of Lekha. “And Lada, father of [<i>avi</i>] Maresha” (I Chronicles 4:21) – the President of the Court [<i>Av Beit Din</i>] of Maresha. “And the families of the house of those who wrought fine linen,” – this is David, who was engaged [in preparing] the Tabernacle curtain.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Which was woven from linen.

He restored [the tablets] to them, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: ‘Write these matters for yourself, as on the basis of these matters [I have established a covenant with you and with Israel]’” (Exodus 34:27). “They are the <i>yotzerim</i>” (I Chronicles 4:23) – on the basis of: “The Lord God formed [<i>vayitzer</i>]” (Genesis 2:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the word <i>yotzerim</i> in the sense of <i>yetzurim</i>, creations. The subject is the words of Torah, because God’s intent in creating the world was in order to give the Torah (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i><br>Another matter, “they are the <i>yotzerim</i>” (I Chronicles 4:23) – these are the souls of the righteous with whom the Holy One blessed be He consulted when creating the world. “And the dwellers among the plants” (I Chronicles 4:23) – on the basis of: “And the Lord God planted” (Genesis 2:8). “And a fence” (I Chronicles 4:23) – on the basis of what is stated: “Who placed the sand for the bound of the sea” (Jeremiah 5:22). “With the king in his service” (I Chronicles 4:23) – the souls of the righteous sat there with the King who is the king of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, and He consulted them and created His world.
Another matter, “and Yokim” (I Chronicles 4:22) – this is Elimelekh.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Who got up [<i>kam</i>] and departed; alternatively, because he established [<i>hekim</i>] all his wealth (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> “And the people of Kozeva” (I Chronicles 4:22) – these are his sons, who were discontinued.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">They died without children.</i> “Yoash” (I Chronicles 4:22) – as they despaired [<i>nitya’ashu</i>] of the Land of Israel. “And Saraf” (I Chronicles 4:22) – as they burned [<i>sarfu</i>] the Torah. Rabbi Menaḥama in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Did they [actually] burn it? Rather, it teaches you that anyone who nullifies even one matter from the Torah, it is as though he burned it. “Who had dominion over Moav” (I Chronicles 4:22), as they married Moavite women, and forsook Israel and cleaved to the fields of Moav. “And Yashuvi Laḥem” (I Chronicles 4:22), this is Naomi, as it is stated: “Naomi returned [<i>vatashav</i>], and Ruth the Moavite, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned [<i>hashava</i>] from the fields of Moav, and they came to Beit Leḥem” (Ruth 1:22). “And the matters are ancient [<i>atikim</i>]” (I Chronicles 4:22) – each and every one of these matters is already [mentioned] explicitly.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Each of these matters is mentioned explicitly in Ruth, and alluded to in the verse in I Chronicles. </i>
<b>“The name of the man was Elimelekh, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons Maḥlon and Kilyon, Ephratites of Bethlehem in Judah.

Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa would expound names. “The name of the man was Elimelekh,” as he would say: To me [<i>elai</i>], the kingdom [<i>malkhut</i>] will come. “And the name of his wife was Naomi,” as her actions were fine [<i>na’im</i>], and pleasant [<i>ne’imim</i>]. “And the names of his two sons Maḥlon and Kilyon” – Maḥlon, for they were eradicated [<i>nimḥu</i>] from the world; Kilyon, for they were eliminated [<i>kalu</i>] from the world. “Ephratites,”<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">An expression of greatness.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: He was a resident of the palace.

He said to him: ‘Ephraim, tribal heads, heads of the yeshiva; the most excellent and outstanding of my children will be called by your name.’ “Son of Toḥu, son of Tzuf, Ephratite” (I Samuel 1:1);<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is referring to Elkana.

“They came to the fields of Moav, and were there.” First they came to their towns, and they found them steeped in transgression. Then they came to the large cities, and they found them lacking in water. Then they returned to the towns; “they came to the fields of Moav, and were there.”
<b>“Elimelekh Naomi's husband died; she and her two sons remained” (Ruth 1:3).</b><br>“Elimelekh Naomi's husband died.” It is taught: Everyone will die, and everyone [knows] that he will die. Praiseworthy is the person who has departed from the world with a good name. If a man dies, it is only his wife who misses him, as it is stated: “Elimelekh Naomi's husband died.” If a woman dies, it is only her husband who misses her, as it is stated: “But I, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died on me” (Genesis 48:7). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Jacob our patriarch said: ‘Rachel’s death was on me, and Rachel’s death was more difficult for me than all the troubles that befell me.’
Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: The Holy One blessed be He brings groups of the same age, and groups that live together, to the world. If one member of the age group dies, the entire age group should be concerned. If one member of the local group dies, the entire group should be concerned, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: There are different kingdoms, and one does not enter the kingdom of his counterpart even a hairbreadth.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, when a man dies, it is because the time has come for someone else to take over whatever position of authority he had. Additionally, the entire group should be concerned that they are all now subject to divine judgement. This reinforces what was stated above, that Naomi must have been grieved by Elimelekh’s death (<i>Yefei Einayim</i>). Alternatively, this may be a veiled critique of Naomi and her sons, who should have taken Elimelekh’s death as a sign that they were all in danger, and returned to the land of Israel (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i><br>Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta said: I never called my wife my wife, or my house my house, but rather, my wife my house, and my house my wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">He did so in deference to his wife, to indicate that she was the foundation of his household.

<b>“They took for themselves Moavite wives: the name of one was Orpa, and the name of the second was Ruth; and they dwelled there approximately ten years” (Ruth 1:4).</b><br>“They took for themselves Moavite wives.” It is taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: They did not convert them, they did not immerse them, the <i>halakha</i> had not yet been innovated, such that they would not have been punished for them; an Ammonite and not a female Ammonite, a Moavite and not a female Moavite.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">It had not yet been clarified that the Torah’s prohibition against marrying a convert from the nations of Amon and Moav (see Deuteronomy 23:4) applied only to male converts and not to female converts (see <i>Yevamot</i> 76b-77a). Maḥlon and Kilyon married them despite the fact that they did not convert, and despite the fact that, as far as they were aware, it was forbidden to marry them even if they converted. </i><br>“The name of one was Orpa,” because she turned her back [<i>oref</i>] to her mother-in-law. “And the name of the second was Ruth [<i>Rut</i>],” because she saw [<i>ra’ata</i>] truth in the words of her mother-in-law. Rabbi Beivai said in the name of Rabbi Reuven: Ruth and Orpa were the daughters of Eglon, as it is stated: “I have a secret matter for you king.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Eglon, king of Moav.</i> He said: Be silent…” (Judges 3:19), and it is written: “Ehud came to him…Ehud said: I have a matter of God to you, and he stood from his throne” (Judges 3:20). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You arose from your throne in deference to Me, by your life, I will establish a son from you who will sit on the throne of God.’<br>“They dwelled there approximately ten years.” [Whenever a verse uses this terminology, such as:]“Approximately thirty” (Judges 20:31), “approximately forty” (Joshua 4:13), [it means a bit] less or more [than the stated number].
<b>“Both of them died, Maḥlon and Kilyon, and the woman was bereft of her two children and of her husband” (Ruth 1:5).</b><br>“Both of them died, Maḥlon and Kilyon.” Rabbi Ḥunya, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Rabbi Avin, and Rabbi Zavda, son-in-law of Rabbi Levi [said]: The all-Merciful [God] never exacts retribution against a person himself initially. From whom do you learn this? From Job, as it is stated: “There came a messenger to Job, and said: ‘The oxen were plowing [and the donkeys grazing beside them; and Sheba fell upon them, and took them; they smote the servants by sword; and only I by myself escaped to tell you]’” (Job 1:14–15).<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">God did not initially kill Job or even afflict him with bodily pain; He struck Job’s property.</i> Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: The Holy One blessed be He showed him a representative taste of the World to Come, “the plowman will meet the reaper” (Amos 9:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Donkeys do not typically graze in fields where oxen have just plowed.

Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: When Job heard, he began mobilizing his armies for war. He said: ‘How many armies can I enlist, how many troops can I muster?

Regarding leprosy, too, the same is true: Initially it afflicts his house. If he repents, excellent; if not, they require removal, as it is stated: “The priest shall command and they will remove [the stones]” (Leviticus 14:40). If he repents, excellent; if not, they require demolition. If he repents, excellent; if not, [the signs of leprosy] come upon his garments and they require laundering.

Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: At times, He does so for the sake of His people and His inheritance, and at times He does so for the sake of His great name. Rabbi Aivu said: When Israel merit it, it is for the sake of His people and His inheritance; when Israel does not merit it, it is for the sake of His great name. The Rabbis say: In the Land of Israel, it is for the sake of His people and His inheritance; outside the Land of Israel, it is for the sake of His great name, as it is stated: “For My sake, for My sake, I will do” (Isaiah 48:11).
<b>“She departed from the place where she had been, and her two daughters-in-law with her; they went on the way to return to the land of Judah” (Ruth 1:7).</b><br>“She departed from the place where she had been.” “She departed” – was it she alone who departed from there?

He challenged the Israelites for forty days until David confronted him and killed him.</i> Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Orpa walked four <i>mil</i> with her mother-in-law, and four mighty men came from her, as it is stated: “These four were born to the giant [<i>harafa</i>]”<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to Orpa.</i> (II Samuel 21:22). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Throughout that night that Orpa took her leave from her mother-in-law, the nakedness of one hundred gentiles was intermingled with her; that is what is written: “He spoke with them…from the ranks [<i>mima’arkhot</i>] of the Philistines” (I Samuel 17:23) – <i>mime’arot</i> is written; from one hundred foreskins [<i>me’a orlot</i>] of gentiles that were inserted into her throughout the night. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: One dog, too, as it is written: “The Philistine said to David: Am I a dog?” (I Samuel 17:43).
“Orpa kissed her mother-in-law.” All kisses are of licentiousness, except for three: A kiss of greatness, a kiss of absence, and a kiss of parting. A kiss of greatness, as it is written: “Samuel took a flask of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him” (I Samuel 10:1). Of absence, as it is written: “He met him at the mountain of God at Ḥorev [and he kissed him]” (Exodus 4:27). Of parting, as it is stated: “Orpa kissed her mother-in-law.” Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Even a kiss of closeness, as it is stated: “Jacob kissed Rachel” (Genesis 29:11). Why? It is because she was his relative.<br><b>“She said: Behold, your sister-in-law has returned to her people, and to her god; return after your sister-in-law” (Ruth 1:15).</b><br>“She said: Behold, your sister-in-law has returned [to her people, and to her god]…” – once she returned to her people she returned to her god.
<b>“Ruth said: Do not entreat me to leave you, to return from following you, as where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people is my people, and your God is my God” (Ruth 1:16).</b><br>“Ruth said: Do not entreat me to leave you, to return from following you.” What is “do not entreat me”? She said to her: ‘Do not sin to me, do not impose your reservations upon me.’ “To leave you, to return from following you” – in any case, my intention is to convert. It is preferable through you, and not through another. When Naomi heard this, she began arranging the laws of converts for her. She said to her: ‘My daughter, it is not the way of Israelite women to go to theaters and circuses of the gentiles.’ [Ruth] said to her: “Where you go, I will go.” [Naomi] said to her: ‘My daughter, it is not the way of Israel to reside in a house where there is no <i>mezuza</i>.’ [Ruth] said to her: “And where you lodge, I will lodge.” “Your people is my people” – these are punishments and prohibitions.” “Your God is my God” – [these are] the rest of the <i>mitzvot</i>.
Another matter, “where you go, I will go,” – to the Tent of Meeting, in the Gilgal, in Shilo, in Nov, in Givon, and in the eternal Temple; “and where you lodge, I will lodge” – I will stay the night after I bring my offerings. “Your people is my people” – to abrogate my idol worship. “And your God is my God” – to pay the reward for my actions.
<b>“Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried; so may the Lord do to me, and so may He continue, as death will separate between you and me” (Ruth 1:17).</b><br>“Where you die, I will die” – there are the four court-imposed death penalties: Stoning, burning, beheading, and strangling.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth was accepting upon herself mitzvot, including the consequences they carry.</i> “And there I will be buried,” these are the two cemeteries designated for the court, one for those stoned and burned, and one for those beheaded and strangled. “So may the Lord do to me, and so may He continue” – [Naomi] said to her: ‘My daughter, amass as many <i>mitzvot</i> and acts of righteousness that you can amass in this world, but in the future “death will separate between you and me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">After death one can no longer perform mitzvot, and each person is rewarded according to what he or she has done during their lifetime.</i>

Chapter 3

<b>“Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried; so may the Lord do to me, and so may He continue, as death will separate between you and me” (Ruth 1:17).</b><br>That<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the previous passage, that good deeds and righteous actions must be accomplished in this world. </i> is what the verse said: “Small and great are there; and a servant is free from his master” (Job 3:19) – Rabbi Simon said: This is one of four verses that are similar to one another. “Small and great are there” – in this world, one who is small can become great, and one who is great can become small. But in the future,<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">In the World to Come.</i> one who is small cannot become great and one who is great cannot become small. “And a servant is free of his master” – that is, he does the will of his Maker [<i>yotzero</i>], angers his [evil] inclination [<i>yitzro</i>]; when he dies, he goes free, as it is stated: “And a servant is free of his master.”<br>Rabbi Meyasha, grandson of Rabbi Yehoshua, was gravely ill for three days. After three days he recovered. His father said to him: ‘Where have you been?’ He said to him: ‘I was in a chaotic world.’ He said to him: ‘What did you see there?’ He said to him: ‘I saw many people who are respected here and disgraced there.’ When Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish heard, they went to visit him. His father said to them: ‘Have you heard what this child said?’ They said to him: ‘What did he say?’ He related the matter to them. Reish Lakish said: ‘Is it not an explicit verse? “So said the Lord God: Remove the mitre, and lift the crown; this shall no longer be; exalt the abased, and abase the exalted”’ (Ezekiel 21:31). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Had I come up only to hear this matter, it would have sufficed. Rav Huna the Exilarch asked Rabbi Ḥisdai: What is this that is written: “Remove the mitre, and lift the crown?” He said to him: “Remove the mitre” from our rabbis, and “lift the crown” from the nations of the world. He said to him: You are kindness,<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on his name. You, Ḥisdai, are kindness, <i>ḥesed</i>.</i> and what is yours is kindness.
It is written: “For he who is joined [<i>yeḥubar</i>] [to all of the living has hope, for a live dog is better than a dead lion]” (Ecclesiastes 9:4) – there<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">There, meaning the Land of Israel. This tradition was brought from the Land of Israel to Babylonia. See <i>Tosefta Berakhot</i> 6:2.</i> we learn: One who sees an idol, what blessing does he recite? Blessed…who shows patience to violators of His will. A place from which idol worship has been uprooted? Blessed…who uprooted idol worship from our land; and may it likewise be Your will O Lord our God that You uproot it from all places and restore the hearts of their worshippers to worship You wholeheartedly.

Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “[For he who is] chosen [<i>yevuḥar</i>]” is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic spelling [<i>ketiv</i>] is <i>yevuḥar</i>, while the Masoretic reading [<i>keri</i>] is <i>yeḥubar.</i> Rabbi Yoḥanan claims that this spelling serves to teach that even the wicked have choice [<i>beḥira</i>], and they can forsake evil and repent.</i> Even those who raised their hand against the Temple have hope. To revive them [in the afterlife] is impossible, as they already raised their hand against the Temple. To eliminate them is impossible, as they have already repented. In their regard it is stated; “They will sleep an eternal sleep, and they will not awaken” (Jeremiah 51:39) – it is taught: Gentile minors and the troops of Nebuchadnezzar<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Because they were following orders and had little choice, or because they repented.</i> are not revived [at the end of days], but are not condemned. In their regard it is stated: “They will sleep an eternal sleep and they will not awaken.”<br>“For a live dog is better than a dead lion” (Ecclesiastes 9:4) – in this world, one who is a dog can become [strong as] a lion, and one who is a lion can become a dog. However, in the future, one who is a lion cannot become a dog, and anyone who is a dog cannot become a lion. Hadrian, may his bones be crushed, asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: He said to him: ‘I am better than Moses, your master.’ He said to him: ‘Why?’ ‘Because I am alive and he is dead, and it is written: “For a live dog is better than a dead lion.”’ He said to him: ‘Are you able to issue a decree that no man shall light a fire for three days?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ In the evening, both of them climbed to the wall of the palace and saw smoke rising at a distance. He said to him: ‘What is that?’ He said to him: ‘The governor is ill, and a doctor went in and visited him. He said to him: You will not be cured until you drink hot water.’ He said to him: ‘May his spirit be blasted.<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">He said this to Hadrian, using the third person out of deference to the emperor.</i> While you are still alive, your edict is void. Moses our master, from the moment that he decreed upon us: “You shall not kindle fire in all your habitations on the day of Shabbat” (Exodus 35:3), no Jew has ever kindled fire on Shabbat, and his edict has not been voided even now. And you say: I am better than he is?’<br>“Lord, make my end known to me, and the measure of my days, what it is; [I would know how impermanent I am]” (Psalms 39:5) – David said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, make known to me when I will die.’ He said to him: ‘It is a secret that is not revealed to a person, and it is not possible for it to be revealed to you.’ “And the measure of my days, what it is” – He [God] said to him: ‘Seventy years.’ “I would know how impermanent I am” (Psalms 39:5) – make known to me on which day I will die. He said to him: ‘On Shabbat.’ He [David] said to Him: ‘Subtract one day for me.’ He said to him: ‘No.’ He said to Him: ‘Why?’ He said to him: ‘One prayer that you are destined to pray before Me is more precious to Me than a thousand burnt offerings that Solomon your son is destined to sacrifice before Me, as it is stated: “One thousand burnt offerings Solomon offered upon that altar”’ (I Kings 3:4). He said to Him: ‘Add one day for me.’ He said to him: ‘No.’ He said to Him: ‘Why?’ He said to him: ‘The dominion of your son is pressing, as Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: There are many dominions, and one of them does not enter into the dominion of another even a hair’s breadth.’ He died on <i>Shavuot</i> that coincided with Shabbat. The Sanhedrin entered to pay their respects to Solomon. He said to them: ‘Can I move him [the body] from place to place?’ They said to him: ‘Is it not a mishna: One may rub with oil and wash [a corpse], provided that he does not move a limb?’<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Shabbat</i> 23:5.</i><br>He [Solomon] said: ‘The dogs of father’s house are hungry.’<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">He feared they would desecrate the corpse.</i> They said to him: ‘Is it not a mishna: One may cut pumpkins before an animal and an animal carcass before dogs?’<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Shabbat</i> 24:4.</i> What did he do? He took a curtain and spread it over him [David’s body], so the sun would not beat down on him.

He said: “The crooked cannot be mended, and deficiency cannot be counted” (Ecclesiastes 1:15) – in this world, one who is crooked can be mended, and one who is mended can become crooked. But in the future, one who is crooked cannot be mended, and one who is mended cannot become crooked. “And deficiency cannot be counted” – there are wicked ones who associate with one another in the world; one of them repented before his death, and one did not repent. It turns out that this one stands in the company of the righteous, and that one stands in the company of the wicked. He [the one who did not repent] sees him [the other one] and says: ‘Woe is me, perhaps there is favoritism in this matter? [Both] I and that one have stolen, both I and that one have killed; yet that one is standing in the company of the righteous, and this one [referring to himself] is standing in the company of the wicked.’ They [the angels] respond and say to him: ‘Fool of the world, you were despicable, and you were cast aside after your death for three days; did they not drag you to the grave with ropes? “Beneath you maggots are spread and worms are your cover” (Isaiah 14:11). When your friend understood this, he repented from that path. You, too, had the opportunity to repent, but did not do so.’ He says to them: ‘Allow me to go and repent,’ and they respond to him and say: ‘Fool of the world, do you not know that this world is like Shabbat, and the world from which you came is like the day before Shabbat. If a person does not prepare on the day before Shabbat, what will he eat on Shabbat? Moreover, this world is like the sea, and the world from which you came is like dry land. If a person does not prepare on dry land, what will he eat at sea? Moreover, this world is like the wilderness, and the world from which you came is like civilization. If a person does not prepare in civilization, what will he eat in the wilderness?’ What does he do? He folds his hands and eats his flesh, as it is stated: “The fool folds his hands and eats his flesh” (Ecclesiastes 4:5). He says: ‘Allow me to see my friend in his glory [in heaven].’ They say to him: ‘Fool of the world, we are commanded from the mouth of the Almighty, that the wicked will not stand alongside the righteous, and not the righteous alongside the wicked, not the impure alongside the pure, and not the pure alongside the impure. About what are we commanded? It is about this gate, as it is stated: “This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter into it”’ (Psalms 118:20).
An illustration: Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta were sitting to study the Torah in the great study hall of Tiberias on the day before Passover, and some say that it was the day before the great fast [Yom Kippur]. They heard the sound of people crying.<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Because they were too poor to buy food for the holiday.</i> He [Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta] said to him [Rabbi Ḥiyya]: ‘Those people, what will they do?’ He said: ‘One who has, will buy, and one who does not have will go to his employer and he will give them.’ He said to him: ‘If so, I too will go to my employer, and He will give me.’ He went out and prayed in the cave by Tiberias and he saw a hand outstretched to him with a pearl. He went and brought it to Rabbeinu [Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi]. He said to him: ‘From where did you get this? It is priceless. [Do not sell it;] rather, here are three dinars for you,<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">He lent him the three dinars so that Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta would not need to sell the pearl in order to make preparations for the holiday. </i> go and make preparations in honor of the day, and after the holiday we will publicize it, and whoever offers the highest price will take it.’ He took the three dinars and went and bought his purchases and entered his house. His wife said to him: ‘Shimon, have you begun to steal? All your property is worth only a hundred <i>maneh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Ten thousand dinars. She is presumably utilizing hyperbole.</i> and [so] what are these purchases? He immediately related the incident to her. She said to him: ‘What do you want? That your canopy be one pearl smaller than that of your colleagues in the World to Come?’ He said to her: ‘What should we do?’ She said to him: ‘Go, return the purchases to their owner, the dinars to their owner, and the pearl to its owner.’<br>When he heard, Rabbeinu was upset. He sent for her and she came to him. He said: ‘You caused all this distress to this righteous one.’ She said to him: ‘What do you want? That his canopy will be one pearl smaller than yours in the World to Come?’ He said to her: ‘And if it will be smaller, are we not able to make it up [i.e., make up whatever is missing from his merit]?’ She said to him: ‘Rabbi, in this world we have been privileged to see your face;<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">But not in the World to Come.</i> did Reish Lakish not say: Each righteous person will have a compartment for himself?’ And he [Rabbeinu] conceded to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">He prayed for God to take the pearl back, and a hand emerged and took it.</i> Moreover, it is the way of Heaven to give, but it is not its way to take. The latter miracle was more difficult than the former. When it [the pearl] was taken, the hand was lower, and when it gave it to him, the hand was higher, like a person who lends money to another.
<b>“She saw that she was determined to go with her”</b> – Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Come and see how precious converts are before the Omnipresent.

<b>“The two of them went until they came to Bethlehem.

Boaz’s wife died on that day, and all of Israel assembled to show kindness [to participate in the funeral]. As all the populace was going to show kindness, Ruth entered with Naomi; this one [Boaz’s first wife] departed, and that one entered.<br>“The entire city was in a tumult about them and the women said: Is that Naomi” – is that she whose actions are fine and pleasant [<i>ne’imim</i>]? In the past, she would go about in her litters, and now she is walking barefoot, and [that is why] you say: “Is that Naomi?” In the past she was clothed in silken garments, and now she is clothed in rags, and you say: “Is that Naomi?” In the past, her face was red from food and drink, and now her face is pale from hunger, and you say: “Is that Naomi?”<br><b>She said to them: Do not call me Naomi, call me Mara; as the Almighty has greatly embittered [<i>hemar</i>] me (Ruth 1:20).</b><br>And she says to them: “Do not call me Naomi [pleasantness]; call me Mara [bitterness]” – Bar Kappara said: [It is analogous] to an inferior cow whose owner stood it in the marketplace and said: It is for plowing and it plows straight furrows.

Chapter 4

Regarding that which the verse states: “Shaḥarayim begot children in the field of Moav [after he had sent them away, Ḥushim and Baara his wives]” (I Chronicles 8:8), Elijah, of blessed memory, asked Rabbi Nehorai, he said to him: ‘What is this that is written: “Shaḥarayim begot in the field of Moav”?’ [Rabbi Nehorai] said to him: ‘A great man begot in the field of Moav.’ “After he had sent them away” (I Chronicles 8:8) – as they were from the tribe of Benjamin, as it is written: “The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying” (Judges 20:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the term “sent” appears in Judges regarding the tribe of Benjamin, the verse in Chronicles is hinting to the fact that the man’s wives were from the tribe of Benjamin. </i><br>Another interpretation, “Shaḥarayim,” this is Boaz. Why was his name called Shaḥarayim? It is because he was free [<i>meshuḥrar</i>] of iniquities. “Begot in the field of Moav,” as he begot from Ruth the Moavite. “After he had sent them away,” as he was from the tribe of Judah, as it is stated: “And he sent Judah before him to Joseph” (Genesis 46:28). “Ḥushim and Baara his wives,” does a man beget his wives? Rather, he was swift like a leopard and articulated the <i>halakha</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">He expounded the verse: “An Amonite and a Moavite shall not enter the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4).</i> An Amonite but not an Amonite woman, a Moavite but not a Moavite woman. “He begot from Ḥodesh his wife” (I Chronicles 8:9) – it should have stated only, “from Baara his wife.” Rather, in his days, the <i>halakha</i> of an Amonite but not an Amonite woman, a Moavite and not a Moavite woman, was introduced [<i>nitḥadsha</i>].<br>One verse says: “Yitra the Ishmaelite” (see I Chronicles 2:17), and one verse says: “Yitra the Israelite” (II Samuel 17:25). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: He is Yitra the Ishmaelite, he is Yitra the Israelite.<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Both verses refer to the same person.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman and the Rabbis: Rabbi Shmuel said: He was an Ishmaelite, and you say Israelite? Rather, he was an Ishmaelite.

The Rabbis say: He was an Israelite, and you say Ishmaelite? Rather, he was an Israelite and he girded his sword like an Ishmaelite. He stuck his sword in the middle of the study hall and said: I will either kill or be killed until I establish the <i>halakha</i> for the multitudes, so that anyone who abrogates this <i>halakha</i>, I will behead him with this sword: An Amonite but not an Amonite woman, a Moavite and not a Moavite woman.
<b>“Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moavite, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned from the field of Moav, and they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest” (Ruth 1:22).</b><br>“Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moavite, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned from the field of Moav” – it was she who returned from the field of Moav.<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">She was the first Moavite woman to marry into Israel.</i> “And they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Wherever “barley harvest” is stated, the verse is referring to the cutting of the <i>omer</i>. “Wheat harvest” – the verse is referring to the offering of the two loaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>omer</i> offering, brought on the sixteenth of Nisan, was made from barley flour.

<b>“Naomi had an acquaintance of her husband’s, a mighty man of valor, from the family of Elimelekh, and his name was Boaz” (Ruth 2:1).</b><br>“Naomi had an acquaintance [<i>moda</i>] of her husband’s, a mighty man of valor” – <i>moda</i> means relative. Rabbi Abbahu said: If a giant marries a giantess, what do they produce? Mighty men of valor. Boaz married Ruth; what did they produce? David, “who knows how to play, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, understanding in matters, a comely man, and the Lord is with him” (I Samuel 16:18). “Who knows how to play” – [refers to his expertise] in Bible; “a mighty man of valor” – in Mishna; “a man of war” – he knows to negotiate the battle of Torah; “understanding in matters” – in good deeds; “a comely man” – in Talmud. Alternatively: “Understanding in matters” – he infers one matter from another matter; “a comely man” – who displays understanding in <i>halakha</i>; “and the Lord is with him” – the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion.<br>“From the family of Elimelekh, and his name was Boaz” – the wicked precede their name: “Goliath was his name” (I Samuel 17:4); “Naval is his name” (I Samuel 25:25); “Sheva son of Bikhri was his name” (II Samuel 20:21). However, the righteous, their names precede them: “And his name was Kish” (I Samuel 9:1); “and his name was Saul” (I Samuel 9:2); “and his name was Yishai” (I Samuel 17:12); “and his name was Mordekhai” (Esther 2:5); “and his name was Elkana” (I Samuel 1:1). It is because they are similar to their Creator, as it is written: “But with My name, the Lord, I was not known to them” (Exodus 6:3).<br>They objected to him: “And his name was Laban” (Genesis 24:29). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is an obvious characteristic.<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">He was extremely white [<i>lavan</i>] or was a senior judge who sought to clarify matters.

<b>“Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and he said to the reapers: May the Lord be with you. They said to him: May the Lord bless you” (Ruth 2:4).</b><br>“Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem” – Rabbi Tanḥuma said in the name of the Rabbis: There are three matters that the earthly court decreed and the supernal court agreed with them, and these are: To greet another with the name of God, the Scroll of Esther, and tithes. Greeting others, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “That think to cause My people to forget My name” (Jeremiah 23:27). When did they think to do so? It was during the days of Atalyahu. The Rabbis say: It was during the days of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya. Rabbi Ḥananya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: It was during the days of Mordekhai and Esther. But Boaz and his court had arisen and instituted to greet another with the name of God, as it is stated: “Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and he said to the reapers: May the Lord be with you.” Likewise, the angel said to Gideon: “The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor” (Judges 6:12).<br>The Scroll of Esther, from where is it derived? Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: What did Mordekhai and Esther do? They wrote letters and sent them to all the residents of the Diaspora: Do you accept upon yourselves “to observe these two days” (Esther 9:27)? [The residents of the Diaspora] sent and said [in response]: Are our problems with Haman not enough, that you impose upon us to observe these two days?<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">They were afraid that their celebration would arouse the ill will of the gentiles.</i> They said to them: If you are afraid of this matter, it is written among the volumes, as it is stated: “[All the acts of his power and his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordekhai, how the king advanced him,] are they not written in the book of chronicles [of the kings of Media and Persia]?” (Esther 10:2). What did they do? They wrote a second letter and sent it to them, “this second letter of Purim” (Esther 9:29).<br>Rabbi Ḥelbo said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: There were eighty-five elders, among them thirty-plus prophets who were distressed over this verse: “These are the commandments that the Lord commanded Moses” (Leviticus 27:34) – “these” [indicates that] one may not add and one may not subtract, and a prophet is not permitted to introduce anything new from now on; and Mordekhai and Esther are asking us to take upon ourselves something new? [They were distressed] until the Holy One blessed be He enlightened them and they found it written in the Torah, in the Prophets, and in the Writings:<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">They found an allusion to the writing of the book of Esther, and therefore were no longer concerned that the observance of Purim was considered a forbidden addition to the Torah.</i> In the Torah, as it is written: “Write this as a memorial in the book” (Exodus 17:14). In the Prophets, as it is written: “They who feared the Lord spoke one with another; and the Lord heeded, and heard, and it was written in the book [of remembrance]” (Malachi 3:16). In the Writings, as it is written: “Are they not written in the book of chronicles” (Esther 10:2). Rav, Rabbi Ḥanina, Rabbi Yonatan, bar Kappara, and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: This scroll was not stated by the court,<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">It was not the court in the time of Mordekhai and Esther that first introduced the book of Esther.</i> but rather was stated at Sinai, but there is no chronological order to the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, it does not appear in writing until the book of Esther.</i> From where is it derived that the Holy One blessed be He agreed with them? Rav said: “The Jews fulfilled and received [<i>vekibbelu</i>]” (Esther 9:27), <i>vekibbelu</i> (pl.)<i></i> is not written, <i>vekibbel</i> (sing.) is written; the master of the Jews received it.<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>vekibbelu</i> is written without the concluding <i>vav</i>, such that it can be read in the singular.

One verse says: “It is signed [<i>al heḥatum</i> (sing.)]” (Nehemiah 10:1), and one verse says: “It is signed [<i>al haḥatumim</i> (pl.)]” (Nehemiah 10:2). How so? Rather, <i>al heḥatum</i> is the supernal court, and <i>al haḥatumim</i> is the earthly court. Some say, the proscription of Jericho as well:<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Following the capture of Jericho, Joshua declared all its spoils proscribed.</i> So said the Holy One blessed be He to Joshua: “Israel has sinned [and they have even transgressed My covenant; they have also taken from the proscribed spoils]” (Joshua 7:11).

<b>“Boaz said to his servant who was appointed over the reapers: Whose is this young woman?” (Ruth 2:5).</b><br>“Boaz said to his servant who was appointed over the reapers” – over how many was he appointed?

Rather, once he saw that she was pleasant and her actions were fine, he began asking about her. All the women would bend at the waist and gather, and this one would sit and gather. All the women would raise their skirts, and she would lower her skirts. All the women would jest with the reapers, while she would conduct herself modestly. All the women would gather between the sheaves, and she would gather from what had been abandoned.<br>Similarly, “When Saul saw David emerge against the Philistine [he said to Avner, commander of the army: Avner, whose son is this lad?]” (I Samuel 17:55); did he not know who he was? The day before, he had sent to Yishai saying: “Please let David stand before me, as he has found favor in my eyes” (I Samuel 16:22), and now he is asking about him?

If he descends from Zeraḥ, he is a judge.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Saul knew that David was from the tribe of Judah but did not know from which of Judah’s sons he descended, from Peretz or Zeraḥ.

Rather, it is written: “All the glory of the king’s daughter is inside” (Psalms 45:14); it is not for a woman to go out, it is for a man to go out. “And they hired against you” (Deuteronomy 23:5) – it is for a man to pay wages and not for a woman.<br><b>“The servant that was appointed over the reapers answered and said: She is a Moavite young woman who returned with Naomi from the field of Moav” (Ruth 2:6).</b><br>“The servant that was appointed over the reapers answered and said: She is a Moavite young woman”; and you said her actions are fine and pleasant?

<b>“Boaz said to Ruth: Have you not heard, my daughter?

I will cry to Him. If He answers, that is good; if He does not answer, everything is one, all the gods are the same.’ At that moment, the ministering angels arose and sealed all the supernal windows, and they said before Him: ‘Master of the Universe, a person who placed an idol in the Sanctuary, are You accepting him through repentance?’ He said to them: ‘If I do not accept him through repentance, I would thereby be locking the door before all penitents.’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He excavated an opening beneath His throne of glory, in a place that no angel has control. That is what is written: “He prayed to Him, He acceded to his entreaty [<i>vaye’ater</i>] and He heard his supplication” (II Chronicles 33:13). Rabbi Levi said: In Arabia, they call excavation <i>atira</i>. “He handed her roasted grain” – the kingship returned to him, as it is stated: “He returned him to Jerusalem, to his kingdom” (II Chronicles 33:13). With what did He return him? Rabbi Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Aḥa said: He returned him with the wind. This is what is said: He causes the wind to blow. “She ate, was sated, and left over” – he eats in this world, eats in messianic days, and eats in the future.<br>Alternatively, it is referring to the messianic king. “Come here” – draw near to kingship. “Eat of the bread” – this is the bread of kingship. “Dip your loaf in the vinegar” – these are the afflictions, as it is stated: “He was pained by our transgressions” (Isaiah 53:5). “She sat beside [<i>mitzad</i>] the reapers” – his kingship is destined to be temporarily captured [<i>litzod</i>] from him, as it says: “I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem for the war and the city will be captured” (Zechariah 14:2). “He handed her roasted grain” – it is destined to return to him, as it is stated: “He will smite the land with the rod of his mouth” (Isaiah 11:4). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Levi: Like the initial redeemer, so the ultimate redeemer. Just as the initial redeemer was revealed, and then was again concealed from them, and for how long was he concealed from them, for three months, as it is stated: “They encountered Moses and Aaron” (Exodus 5:20);<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets this as referring to the officers of the Israelites meeting Moses and Aaron after Moses returned from a three-month hiatus in Midyan. See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 5:19, which similarly states that Moses departed to Midyan, but states that it was for six months.</i> so too, the ultimate redeemer will be revealed to them and concealed from them. How long will he be concealed from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma in the name of the Rabbis: Forty-five days; that is what is written: “From the time the daily offering is abolished…[one thousand two hundred and ninety days]” (Daniel 12:11), and it is written: “Happy is one who waits and it comes [to one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days]”(Daniel 12:12). These extra days, what are they? Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ketzarta in the name of Rabbi Yona: These are the forty-five days that Israel will gather and eat saltwort; that is what is written: “Who pick saltwort from the bushes.” (Job 30:4).<br>Where will he lead them?<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">Where will the messianic king lead the Jewish people?</i> To the Judean Desert, as it is stated: “Behold, I will seduce her and I will lead her to the desert” (Hosea 2:16). [There is] one who says: To the wilderness of Siḥon and Og, as it is stated: “I will yet settle you in tents as in the days of the appointed times” (Hosea 12:10). Anyone who believes in him will live, and one who does not believe in him will go to the nations of the world and they will kill him. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: Ultimately, the Holy One blessed be He will appear to them and rain down manna for them, “and there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9).<br>Alternatively, “come here,” is referring to Boaz, draw near and “eat of the bread,” this is the bread of the reapers. “Dip your loaf in the vinegar,” as it is the way of reapers to dip their loaves in vinegar. Rabbi Yonatan said: From here it is derived that one takes out sour foods to the threshing floors. “She sat beside the reapers,” she certainly sat alongside them.<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">But not in their midst, for reasons of modesty.</i> “He handed her roasted grain,” a light, small amount, with his two fingers. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: You derive from this one of two matters: Either a blessing rested on the fingers of that righteous man, or that a blessing rested on the innards of that righteous woman. From where? It is from that which is written: “She ate, was sated, and there was some left over.”<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">If he gave her just a pinch of roasted grain, how could she have been sated, with grain to spare?</i> It stands to reason that the blessing rested on the innards of that righteous woman.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: The verse comes to teach you that if a person performs a mitzva he should perform it wholeheartedly, as had Reuben known that the Holy One blessed be He was dictating in his regard: “Reuben heard and he rescued him from their hands” (Genesis 37:21),<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is stated regarding Reuben saving Joseph from his brothers, who wanted to kill him.</i> he would have taken him to his father on his shoulder. Had Aaron known that the Holy One blessed be He was dictating in his regard: “Behold, he is emerging to meet you” (Exodus 4:14), he would have emerged to meet [Moses] with drums and dancing. Had Boaz known that the Holy One blessed be He was dictating in his regard: “He handed her roasted grain, and she ate, was sated, and there was some left over,” he would have fed her fattened calves. Rabbi Kohen and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi: In the past, a person would perform a mitzva and the prophet would write it. Now, when a person performs a mitzva, who writes it? Elijah writes it, and the messianic king, and the Holy One blessed be He affixes a seal for them. That is what is written: “Then those who feared the Lord spoke one with another, [and the Lord heeded, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him]” (Malachi 3:16).

The vengeance against idolaters is in the hands of Israel, as it is stated: “I will place My vengeance upon Edom by means of My people Israel” (Ezekiel 25:14). The vengeance against Israel is in the hands of their poor, as it is stated: “He will cry to the Lord against you, and it will be a sin in you” (Deuteronomy 15:9). Rabbi Avun said: This poor person stands at your door and the Holy One blessed be He stands to his right. If you give to him, He who is standing to his right blesses you, and if not he will exact retribution from that man, as it is stated: “Because He will stand to the right of the indigent” (Psalms 109:31).<br>Rabbi Abbahu said: We must be grateful to the impostors among them. It was told that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish descended into the bathhouse of Tiberias and a poor person encountered them. He said to them: ‘Give me charity.’ They said to him: ‘When we exit we will give you charity.’ When they exited, they found that he was dead. They said: ‘Since we did not give him charity during his lifetime, we will tend to him in his death.’ When they rose to wash him, they found a purse of dinars with him. They said: ‘Rabbi Abbahu spoke well: We must be grateful to the impostors among them, as were it not for the impostors among them, when a person sees one of them asking him for charity and he does not give him immediately, he would be punished with death.’

Rather, these are the Shabbat garments. From here, Rabbi Ḥanina said: A person should have two outer garments, one for weekdays and one for Shabbat. Rabbi Samlai taught this in public. The Torah scholars wept and said: Our outer garments during the week are our outer garments on Shabbat.

It was told that Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta received a field from Rabbi Ḥiyya. He said to him: ‘How much does it produce?’ He said to him: ‘One hundred <i>kor</i>.’ He sowed and he harvested and it produced less than one hundred.

Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa, Rabbi Simon, and the Rabbis – Rabbi Ḥanina said: The conception [<i>iburo</i>] of Moav was not undertaken for the sake of Heaven, but rather for the sake of licentiousness, as it is stated: “Israel was dwelling in Shittim, [and the people began to engage in licentiousness with the daughters of Moav]” (Numbers 25:1). “Did not his descendants do so”<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the word <i>badav</i> to mean descendants.

<b>“Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was merry, and he went to lie down at the end of the pile of grain; and she came stealthily, uncovered his feet, and lay down” (Ruth 3:7).</b><br>“Boaz ate and drank, and his heart was merry.” Why was his heart merry? It is because he recited a blessing on his food. Alternatively, “his heart was merry,” because he ate different sweets after the meal, because it accustoms the tongue to recite Torah. Alternatively, “his heart was merry,” as he engaged in Torah study, as it is stated: “The Torah of your mouth is better for me” (Psalms 119:72). Alternatively, “his heart was merry,” as he was seeking a wife, as it is stated: “One who has found a wife has found goodness” (Proverbs 18:22).<br>“He went to lie at the end of the pile of grain.” Rabbi Yehuda Nesia raised a question before Rabbi Pineḥas bar Ḥama: Boaz was the greatest man in his generation and you say he [lay down] at the end of the grain pile? He said to him: Because that generation was steeped in licentiousness and they would pay a fee to the prostitutes from the threshing floor; that is what is written: “Do not rejoice, Israel, do not exult like the peoples, [as you have licentiously strayed from your God; you have loved the prostitute’s fee upon every threshing-floor of grain]” (Hosea 9:1).

When that righteous one [Boaz] prayed for her, she was remembered, as it is stated: “He said: Blessed are you of the Lord, my daughter.” The Rabbis say: The two of them were remembered only due to the blessing of the righteous, as it is stated: “All the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said: May the Lord render the woman…[like Rachel and like Leah…]” (Ruth 4:11). “You have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: A woman prefers a poor young man to an elderly rich man.

Where are the prolonged days for this one?’ But he did not know that Rabbi Akiva had publicly expounded on it: “So it will be good for you,” in the world that is entirely good; “and you will prolong your days,” in the world that is entirely long.<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">The World to Come.</i><br>Some say, it was because he saw the tongue of Rabbi Yehuda the baker in the mouth of a dog. He said: ‘If for the tongue that toiled in Torah all his days it is so, for a tongue that does not know and does not toil in Torah, all the more so.’ He said: ‘If so, there is no reward given to the righteous and no revival of the dead.’ Some say, it was because when his mother was pregnant with him, she passed houses of idol worship. She smelled [the offering they had sacrificed in their idolatrous rite] and they gave her from that food and she ate it. It was seething in her stomach like the venom of a serpent.<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Because Elisha’s mother had eaten from the idolatrous sacrifice, Elisha had an ingrained desire for sin (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i><br>Years passed and Elisha ben Avuya fell ill. They came and said to Rabbi Meir: ‘Elisha your teacher is ill.’ He went to him. [Rabbi Meir] said to him: ‘Repent.’ [Elisha] said to him: ‘Is [repentance] accepted even in such [circumstances]?’ Rabbi Meir said to him: ‘But is it not written: “You turn man to contrition [<i>daka</i>] [and say: Return, son of man]” (Psalms 90:3) – until his soul is crushed?’<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>daka</i> can mean contrition or crushed. Thus, the verse is interpreted to mean that God wants man to repent even if it is at the very end of his life.</i> At that moment Elisha ben Avuya cried, and he died. Rabbi Meir was joyful. He said: ‘It appears that my teacher departed in repentance.’<br>When they buried him, fire came to burn his grave. They came and said to Rabbi Meir: ‘The grave of your teacher is burning.’ He emerged and spread his garment over it. [Rabbi Meir] said to [Elisha]: “Stay tonight,” (Ruth 3:13) in this world that is entirely night. “It will be in the morning, if he will redeem you, good, he will redeem” (Ruth 3:13). “It will be in the morning,” – in the world that is entirely good. “If he will redeem you, good, he will redeem,” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is good to all” (Psalms 145:9). “But if he will be unwilling to redeem you, I will redeem you, as the Lord lives, lie until the morning” (Ruth 3:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Meir is requesting that Elisha be allowed to rest in peace as long as he himself is alive.

They will rescue Elisha due to the merit of his Torah.’<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the casing is saved from fire on Shabbat due to the scroll, Elisha should be saved due to his Torah.</i> Years later, [Elisha’s] daughters came and demanded charity from Rabbeinu.<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi</i> He said: “Let no one extend kindness to him; and let no one be gracious to his orphans” (Psalms 109:12).

These are Joseph, David, and Boaz. Joseph, as it is written: “How can I perform this great wickedness [and sin to God]?” (Genesis 39:9). Rabbi Ḥunya in the name of Rabbi Idi: Is this verse lacking? “I will sin to the Lord,” is not written here, but rather, “I will sin to God [<i>Elohim</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible generally refers to sinning before the Lord rather than sinning before God. <i>Elohim</i> appears as an expression of oath in the language of the Sages.</i> <If I sin, I am doing it against God; only one who does not believe in God does do>. <He took an oath to his inclination> and said: ‘By God! I will not sin, and I will not perform this great wickedness.’<br>David, from where is it derived?

Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Elazar said: He took an oath to his evil inclination. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He took an oath to Avishai ben Tzeruya. He said to him: ‘As the Lord lives, if you touch him, I will mix your blood with his blood.’<br>Boaz, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “As the Lord lives, lie until the morning” (Ruth 3:13). Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ḥunya, Rabbi Yehuda says: That entire night his evil inclination was agitating him and saying: ‘You are single and seeking a wife and she is single and seeking a husband. Arise and consort with her and she will become your wife.’ He took an oath to his evil inclination and said: ‘As the Lord lives, I will not touch her.’ He said to the woman: “Lie until the morning… if he will redeem you, good, he will redeem.” Rabbi Ḥunya said: “A wise man is strong [<i>baoz</i>]” (Proverbs 24:5), a wise man is Boaz. “And a man of knowledge increases strength” (Proverbs 24:5), but he outdid his evil inclination with an oath.

“He came to the city.” It should have said she came to the city, and yet it says “he came to the city.” This teaches that he was walking with her so that none of the young men would accost her.

<b>“She said: ‘These six measures of barley he gave me, as he said to me: Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law” (Ruth 3:17).</b><br>“She said: These six measures of barley he gave me…” Rabbi Alexandri said: Everywhere that Israel entered, they did not emerge empty-handed. In the looting of Egypt they did not emerge empty-handed, in the looting of Siḥon and Og they did not emerge empty-handed, in the looting of the thirty-one kings they did not emerge empty-handed. “Empty-handed” is stated regarding Egypt, as it is stated: “It will be when you depart, you will not depart empty-handed” (Exodus 3:21); [“empty-handed”] is stated regarding the festival pilgrims: “They shall not appear before Me empty-handed” (Exodus 23:15); and “empty-handed” is stated regarding the righteous, as it is stated: “As he said to me: Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law.” “Empty-handed” that is stated regarding the righteous is not like “empty-handed” that is stated regarding Egypt, but rather, like “empty-handed” that is stated regarding the festival pilgrims, as we learned there: The burnt offering of appearance [must be worth at least] two silver coins and the festival peace offering [must be worth at least] one silver <i>ma’a</i> (Mishna <i>Ḥagiga</i> 1:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">This is a relatively small amount, as the main point is to bring an offering of some kind.

<b>“This was the tradition in Israel regarding redemption and regarding exchange; to validate any matter, a man would remove his shoe and give it to another, this was the testament in Israel” (Ruth 4:7).</b><br>“This was the tradition in Israel regarding redemption and regarding exchange; to validate any matter.” Rabbi Ḥanina interpreted the verse regarding Israel, regarding the nature of Israel.

What is this <i>ketzatza</i>? Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said: Anyone who would sell a field to a gentile, his relatives would bring barrels filled with roasted grain and nuts and would break them before the children. The children would gather them and say: ‘So-and-so was severed [<i>niktzatz</i>] from his ancestral property.’ When he recovered it, they would say: ‘So-and-so returned to his ancestral property.’ Likewise, anyone who would marry a woman who was not suited for him, his relatives would bring barrels filled with roasted grain and nuts and would break them before the children. The children would gather them and say: ‘So-and-so is lost to his family.’ When he would divorce her, they would say: ‘So-and-so returned to his family.’ They then returned to acquiring with a shoe and a sandal, “a man removed his shoe and gave it to another.” They then began acquiring with money, with a document, or by taking possession. The three of them are written in one verse: “They will purchase fields for money” (Jeremiah 32:44) – this is money; “and write the deeds and seal them” (Jeremiah 32:44) – these are the witnesses on a document; “and attest witnesses” (Jeremiah 32:44) – these are the witnesses of possession.<br>Rabbi Yosei in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Money does not effect transaction if it is less than the equivalent of one <i>peruta</i>.

<b>“The redeemer said to Boaz: Buy it for yourself. He removed his shoe” (Ruth 4:8).</b><br>“The redeemer said to Boaz: Buy it for yourself. He removed his shoe.” Whose shoe?

Alternatively, the exposition is derived from the unusual phrase: “The Lord granted her pregnancy” (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i>
<b>“The women said to Naomi: Blessed is the Lord, who has not left you without a redeemer today, and may his name be proclaimed in Israel” (Ruth 4:14).</b><br>“The women said to Naomi: Blessed is the Lord, who has not left you without a redeemer today.” Just as the day rules over the heavens, so, it will be with your descendants; they will dominate and rule over Israel forever. Rabbi Ḥunya said: It was due to the women’s blessing that the line of David was not cut off during the days of Atalyahu.<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">Atalyahu killed all of David’s male descendants with the exception of one small child who was successfully hidden away, the future King Yehoash (II Kings chapter 11).</i> Rabbi Tanḥuma said, in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: There it is written: “We will give life to offspring from our father” (Genesis 19:32). Son is not written here, but rather, offspring – that offspring that will come from elsewhere, and who is this? It is the messianic king.<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">The verse cited is that which describes Lot’s daughters seeking to become pregnant by Lot. What they wanted was a son, yet the verse states the more general term offspring. This is an allusion to a descendant who would eventually come to be from their actions, namely the messianic king, who descends from Ruth, who herself was from Moav—the son produced by Lot and his younger daughter. The term redeemer mentioned in Ruth 4:14 is an allusion to the messianic king (<i>Midrash Hamevoar</i>).</i>
<b>“He will be for you a restorer of life, and nourisher of your old age, as your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him” (Ruth 4:15).</b><br>“He will be for you a restorer of life, and nourisher of your old age...[who is better to you than seven sons].” Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: Than the seven patrilineal heads mentioned later: “Otzem the sixth, David the seventh” (I Chronicles 2:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the seven sons of Yishai.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: Than the seven who are specified here: Peretz, Ḥetzron, Ram, Aminadav, Naḥshon, Salmon, Boaz.

Chapter 8

Rabbi Abba bar Kahana began: “Tremble [<i>rigzu</i>] and do not sin…” (Psalms 4:5). David said before the Holy One, blessed be He: ‘How long will they be provoking [<i>mitragzim</i>] me, and saying: Does he not have flawed lineage? Does he not descend from Ruth the Moavite?’ ‘“…Say in your heart, on your bed…” (Psalms 4:5) – you also, do you not descend from two sisters?<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">You also have lineage that could be considered questionable, as Jacob married two sisters, Leah and Rachel. This would later be prohibited by the Torah. This is stated by David as a response to the elders of Judah, who had been taunting him due to his lineage.</i> You, see what are your roots! “…and be silent, Sela” (Psalms 4:5). Tamar, too, whom Judah your grandfather took as a wife, is that not flawed lineage?<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">Judah married Tamar, who had previously been his daughter-in-law. This relationship too would later be prohibited by the Torah.</i> And she was the daughter of Shem ben Noah.<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages identify him with Malkitzedek king of Shalem, who was a priest, and the Torah severely punishes the daughter of a priest who engages in licentiousness. Consequently, the lineage of her children Peretz and Zeraḥ were compromised by her act of having relations with Judah.</i> What, do you have pedigree?’<br>Rabbi Yaakov bar Aviya said: Confront [<i>argiz</i>] your evil inclination and you will not sin. The Rabbis said: Anger your evil inclination and you will not sin.<br><b>“These are the generations of Peretz: Peretz begot Ḥetzron” (Ruth 4:18).</b><br>“These [<i>eleh</i>] are the generations of Peretz.” Rabbi Abba said: Anywhere that <i>eleh</i> is stated, it rejects what preceded it; <i>ve’eleh</i>, it adds to what preceded it. <As it appears in <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 12 until “informed him that Ishmael repented,” end of quote>.<br><b>“Ḥetzron begot Ram and Ram begot Aminadav” (Ruth 4:19).</b><br>“Ḥetzron begot Ram.” But wasn’t Yeraḥme’el a previous son, [as it is stated:] “the sons of Ḥetzron who were born to him: Yeraḥme’el, Ram, and Keluvi” (I Chronicles 2:9)? Rather, he married a Canaanite woman in order to exalt himself [<i>lehitater</i>] through her, as it is written: “Yeraḥme’el had another wife, and her name was Atara” (I Chronicles 2:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">Since Yeraḥme’el married a Canaanite woman, the line of kingship did not come through him. </i><br><b>“Aminadav begot Naḥshon and Naḥshon begot Salma. Salmon begot Boaz and Boaz begot Oved” (Ruth 4:20–21).</b><br>“Ram begot Aminadav…and [Naḥshon begot…] Salmon.” To this point, they were the ladder for the princes;<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">Of the tribes.</i> from this point on they were ladders to kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">The name Salma, or Salmon, is similar to <i>sulam</i>, ladder. It appears in two different forms in these verses to allude to the change in status of the family: To this point, its members were tribal princes; from Boaz, Salmon’s son, the family was moving toward establishing the Israelite monarchy (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>).</i> Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “Then [<i>az</i>] I said, behold, I have entered” (Psalms 40:8). I should have sung a song when I came.<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">When I was accepted into the congregation.</i> <i>Az</i> means nothing other than song, as it is stated: “Then [<i>az</i>] Moses sang” (Exodus 15:1). I was included in “shall not enter,” and [yet] I entered.<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">David is cited as saying that he was assumed to be included within the prohibition against a Moavite convert entering the congregation, as he was a descendant of Ruth, but he was able to enter the congregation because of the acceptance of the <i>halakha</i> that this prohibition applies only to male converts. </i><br><b>“Oved begot Yishai and Yishai begot David” (Ruth 4:22).</b><br>“In the scroll of a book it is written about me” (Psalms 40:8). “In the scroll” – “whom You commanded that they should not enter into Your congregation” (Lamentations 1:10). “Of a book” – “An Ammonite and a Moavite shall not enter [into the assembly of the Lord]” (Deuteronomy 23:4). Not only did I enter, but in a scroll and a book it is written about me. In the scroll: Peretz, Ḥetzron, Ram, Aminadav, Naḥshon, Oved, Yishai, David.<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the verses in Ruth 4:18–22.</i> In a book – “the Lord said: Arise, anoint him; for this is he” (I Samuel 16:12). Rabbi Huna says: It is written: “The Lord has provided me another [<i>aḥer</i>] offspring” (Genesis 4:25), an offspring that comes from another [<i>aḥer</i>] place, and who is this? It is the messianic king.<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">The messianic king is a descendant of David, and thus David is alluded to in the Torah itself. </i><br>Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Simon [said]: This is analogous to a king who would pass from place to place and a pearl fell from [the crown] on his head. The king and his entire entourage stopped there, and passersby would say: ‘What is the nature [of the stay] of the king and his entourage here?’ They saw and said: ‘A pearl fell from upon his head.’ What did he do? He piled up the dirt, and brought sifters, and sifted one pile but did not find it; the second, but did not find it; and the third, and he found it. They said: ‘The king found his pearl.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: “Go for yourself [<i>lekha</i>]” (Genesis 12:1) – It was you [<i>lekha</i>] that I was anticipating. What need was there to delineate the lineage: “Shem, Arpakhshad, Shelaḥ, Ever, Peleg… Naḥor, Teraḥ” (I Chronicles 1:24–26)? It was only for you. “Abram is [<i>hu</i>] Abraham” (I Chronicles 1:27)<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">It was he [<i>hu</i>] that God was anticipating, and for whom all the previous generations were listed.</i> – “and You found his heart faithful before You” (Nehemiah 9:8). So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to David: ‘What need was there for Me to delineate the lineage: Peretz, Ḥetzron, Ram, Aminadav, Naḥshon, Oved, Yishai? Was it not for you?’ – “I have found David My servant” (Psalms 89:21).<br><br>
