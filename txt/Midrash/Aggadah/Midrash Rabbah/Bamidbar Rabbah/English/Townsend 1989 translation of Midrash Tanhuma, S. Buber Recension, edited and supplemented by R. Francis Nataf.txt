1 (Numb. 8:2) When you set up the lamps: We find that in several places the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded about lighting the lamps with clear oil of beaten olives, and so it says (in Exod. 27:20) “And you shall command the Children of Israel to bring unto you clear oil of beaten olives.” So also it says (in Lev. 24:2, 4), “[Command the Children of Israel to bring unto you clear oil of beaten olives for lighting....] Upon the unalloyed lampstand shall he set up the lamps.” And here also it is written (in Numb. 8:2), “When you set up (literally, raise up) the lamps.”
2 (Is. 42:21) “The Lord was delighted because of His [servant's] righteousness to magnify and glorify Torah”: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, It was not because I need your light that I am telling you to light a lamp. Rather [I am doing so] in order to have you acquire merit (by fulfilling a commandment).” It is likewise written, (in Dan. 2:22), “and the light dwells within Him”; and [similarly] it says (in Ps. 139:12), “Even darkness is not dark to You; for night shines as the day, and darkness becomes like the light.” [Scripture says these things] to inform you that He does not need the lamps of flesh and blood. You yourself know [this truth]. When a person builds a house and makes windows within [his house], he makes windows narrow on the outside and broad on the inside, so that the light will enter from the outside and shine on the inside. But when Solomon built the Temple, he did not make the windows like that.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See above Exod. 8:5; <i>PRK</i> 21:5; Lev. R. 31:7.</i> Rather they were narrow on the inside and broad on the outside so that the light would go out from the Temple and shine outside. It is so stated (in I Kings 6:4), “And for the house he made windows broad and narrow.”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Literally: CLEAR and CLOSED. While the Hebrew is obscure the translation here follows the Targum in order to fit the midrashic context.</i> [This text] is to inform you that He is all light and that He has no need for its light. So why did He command you [to set up the lamps]? In order to have you acquire merit (by fulfilling a commandment). It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2), “When you set up the lamps.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Beha‘aloteka et-hanerot.</i> These words can also mean, IN ELEVATING YOU WITH THE LAMPS.</i> Ergo (in Is. 42:21), “The Lord was delighted because of His [servant's] righteousness.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Be careful to light lamps for My sake, and I will shine a great light for you in the future to come.” It is so stated (in Is. 60:3), “And nations shall walk by your light, even kings by the brightness of your rising.”
3 (Numb. 8:2) “When you set up the lamps”: You find that, when twelve tribes presented offerings at the dedication of the altar, the tribe of Levi did not offer anything. They were depressed and said, “Why were we removed from making an offering at the dedication of the altar?” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who made a banquet and each day invited various artisans. Now he had a certain friend who he loved exceedingly, but he did not invite him along with them. So he was depressed saying, “Perhaps the king harbors [some grievance] against me in his heart. [Perhaps] it is for this reason that the king has not invited me to any of the feasts.” When the days of the feast had passed [the king] called the friend [and] said to him, “For all the people of the province I made [that] feast, but for you only I am making one single feast for yourself. Why? Because you are my friend.” So this king is the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. You find that the twelve tribes brought offerings for the dedication of the altar and the Holy One, blessed be He, accepted them, as stated (in Numb. 7:5), “Take it from them.” But the tribe of Levi did not bring an offering. When the dedication of the altar had passed, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Aaron and his sons, “All the tribes have made a dedication. Now you make a dedication by yourselves.” It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2), “Speak unto Aaron [and say unto him], ‘When you set up the lamps,’” and afterwards [it is written] (in vs. 6), “Take the Levites.” 
4 Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2), “Speak unto Aaron [and say unto him], ‘When you set up the lamps’”: You find that Moses experienced more difficulty in making the menorah then for all the [other] vessels of the tabernacle; until the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him with [His] finger [Moses experienced difficulty with three things....] What is the meaning of hammered work (<i>mqshh</i>)? It is meaning to say, how difficult (<i>mh qshh</i>) it is to make. For Moses spent a lot of effort before the menorah was made; as it says so (in Exod. 25:31), “with difficulty (<i>mqshh</i>, revoweled as <i>miqqashah</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A typical translation of the Masoretic pointing would be: OF HAMMERED WORK.</i> shall the menorah be made.” When it became difficult for him, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Moses, take a talent of gold and cast it into the fire. Then take it out, and it will have been made automatically.” (Ibid. cont.:) “Its base, its shaft, its cups, its knobs, and its flowers from it,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">English translations usually render the end of this verse: …SHALL BE OF ONE PIECE or something similar; however, the midrash follows the interpretation given here.</i> [is to mean] “Make a blow with a hammer, and it will be made automatically.” It was therefore stated (in Exod. 25:31), “of hammered work (i.e. with difficulty) shall [the menorah] be made (<i>ty'sh</i>).” [The verb is spelled] fully with a <i>y</i> (<i>yod</i> in Hebrew) and not written [with the normal spelling] as <i>t'sh</i> (which could be translated, "you shall make"). [It is written with the extra letter] so as to say [that] it shall be made automatically. Moses took a talent of gold and threw it into the fire. Then Moses said, “Master of the world, here is the talent; it is cast into the midst of the fire. Let it be made (<i>ty'sh</i>) in front of You just as You wish.” Immediately the menorah came forth made as it should be. It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:4 end), “according to the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses, [so did he make the menorah].” "Moses made the menorah" is not written here, but merely “he made.” [So] who did make it? The Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “If you are careful to light [the lamps] before Me, I will preserve your souls from everything evil.” Thus their souls are likened to a lamp, as stated (in Prov. 20:27), “A person's soul is the lamp of the Lord.” And it is stated (Numb.8:2), “When you raise up the lamps.”
5 (Numb. 8:2) “When you set up the lamps”: This text is related (to Ps. 18:29), “For You light up my lamp.” Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, are You saying that we should give light before You?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Exod. R. 36:2.</i> [But] You are the light of the world and the light [dwells] with You, as it is written (in Dan. 2:22), ‘[He reveals the deep and secret things, He knows what is in the darkness,] and the light dwells within Him.’ And [now] You are saying (in Numb. 8:2 cont.), ‘[let the seven lamps give their light] in front of the menorah.’” Ergo (in Ps. 18:29, “For You light up my lamp.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “It is not because I need [your light]. Rather it is so that you may give light to Me just as I have given light to you in order to exalt you in the presence of all the nations; so that they will say, ‘See how Israel is giving light to the One who gives light to everyone!’” To what is the matter comparable? To a sighted person and a blind person who were walking on a road. The sighted one said to the blind one, “When we enter into the house, go ahead and light this lamp and make light for me.” The blind one said to him, “In your goodness – when I was on the road, you supported me; until we entered the house you guided me; and now you say to me, ‘Light this lamp and make light for me?’” The sighted one said to him, “So that you do not owe me a favor for my guiding you on the road – hence I said to you, ‘Make light for me.’” Thus this sighted one is the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (Zachariah 4:10), “the eyes of the Lord, ranging over the whole earth.” And the blind one is Israel, as stated (Isaiah 59:10), “We grope, like blind men along a wall.” The Holy One, blessed be He, was leading them and giving them light, as stated (in Exod. 13:21), “And the Lord went before them by day [in a pillar of cloud to guide them on the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light].” When the tabernacle was set up, the Holy One, blessed be He, called to Moses and said to him, “Tell them to give Me light.” It is so stated (in Numb. 8:2), “When you set up [the lamps]” - in order to exalt (<i>lehaalot</i>) you.
6 (Numb. 8:2) “When you set up the lamps”: What is written above the matter (in Numb. 7:1–2)? “So it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished […] that the princes of Israel, [the heads of their ancestral houses, namely the princes of the tribes, the ones in charge of those being numbered,] made their offerings.” Then afterwards (in Numb. 8:2), “Speak unto Aaron [and say unto him], ’When you set up [the lamps].’” This text is related (to Ps. 34:10), “Fear the Lord, O you His holy ones, for those who fear Him lack nothing.” You find above (in Numb. 7) that eleven tribes made offerings, while the tribe of Levi made no offering. So while the tribe of Ephraim made offerings and all of the princes made offerings, the prince of Levi [did not]. Now who was the prince of Levi? This was Aaron, as stated (in Numb. 17:18), “And you shall write the name of Aaron upon the rod of Levi.” So Aaron did not make an offering with the princes, for he said, “Woe to me! Perhaps it is because of me that the Holy One, blessed be He, is not accepting the tribe of Levi.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Go, say unto Aaron, ‘Do not be afraid. You are destined for something greater than this.’” It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:2), “Speak unto Aaron [...], ‘When you are raised.’” The offerings remain in force as long as the Temple exists, but the lamps are forever - (according to Numb. 8:2 cont.) “give their light in front of the menorah.” [Moreover,] all the blessings which I have given you to bless My children shall never pass away. 
7 Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2 cont.), “in front of the menorah”: So that you will not despise this menorah. It is so stated (in Zech. 4:10), “For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice to see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, [even] these seven [...].” “These” are the menorah. “Seven” are the seven lamps corresponding to the seven planets that (ibid. cont.) “roam around all the earth.” These seven likewise are dear to Me. Thus you may not despise them. It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:2:) “let the seven lamps give their light in front of the menorah.” Lest your [evil] drive lead you astray into saying that He (i.e. The Holy One, blessed be He) has need of light, [see] what is written about the windows [of the Temple] (in Ezek. 40:16, 25), “Now there were narrow windows into the cells [...]. Like those windows (<i>kehahallonot</i>) [mentioned above].” "<i>Kahallonot</i>"<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is explaining an extra <i>he</i> (h) which does not belong there.</i> is not written here but "<i>kehahallonot</i>" (understood here as <i>kehah halonot</i> which means "dim windows"), in that they were wide on the outside and narrow on the inside in order to send forth light to the outside.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Numb. 3:2.</i> R. Berekhyah the Priest said, “This lightning is the result of fire from on high. When it goes forth it brightens up the whole world, as stated (in Ezek. 1:13), ‘As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like coals of fire burning with the appearance of torches … [and from the fire there went forth lightning],’ and it brightens up the whole world. And I would need your light? [So] why did I tell to you to give Me light? Simply in order to exalt you (<i>ha'alotekha</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb. 8:2: WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS (<i>ha‘alotekha</i>).</i> R. Hanina said, “Concerning your own eyes they have within them both black and white. Still you see not out of the white but out of the black. [Now if in the case of your eyes, which have within them both black and white, but with you seeing only out of the black], would the Holy One, blessed be He, who is all light need your light?” Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2 cont.), “in front of the menorah.” Flesh and blood lights a lamp from a burning lamp. Could one [ever] light a lamp from the darkness? The Holy One, blessed be He, however, did make a lamp give light from the darkness, as stated (in Gen. 1:2), “with darkness upon the face of the deep.” What is written after that (in vs. 3)? “Then God said, ‘Let there be light.’” [Since] I have brought light out of the darkness, do I have need for your light? So why did I say [to light lamps]? Simply to exalt you (<i>rt</i>.: '<i>lh</i>), (in the words of Exod. 27:20) “to set up (<i>rt</i>.: '<i>lh</i>) an everburning lamp.”
8 Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2), “When you set up [the lamps]”: This text is related (to Ps. 139:12), “Even darkness is not dark to You; for night shines as the day, and darkness becomes like the light.” Yet You are saying to us (in Numb. 8:2), “When you set up the lamps!” To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend. The king said to him, “You should know that I am dining with you; so make ready for me.” His friend went [and] prepared a commoner's<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> couch, a commoner’s menorah [and] a commoner's table. When the king arrived, attendants came with him. They set around menorahs of gold before him on either side. When his friend saw all the splendor, he felt ashamed and concealed everything that he had prepared, because everything was [of the type used by] commoners. The king said to him, “What is this? Did I not tell you that I was dining with you? Why did you prepare nothing for me?” His friend said to him, “My lord king, when I saw all this splendor that came with you, I felt ashamed and concealed everything that I had prepared for you, as it consisted of commoner's utensils.” The king said to him, “By your life, I am rejecting all my utensils which I have brought with me, and out of love for you I only wish to use yours.” So it was with the Holy One, blessed be He. He is all light, as stated (in Dan. 2:22), “and the light dwells within Him.” When he says to Israel, “Prepare a menorah and lamps for Me,” what is written there (in Exod. 25:8, 31)? “And let them make Me a sanctuary and I shall dwell within them; And you shall make a menorah of pure gold.” When they had done so, immediately the Divine Presence arrived. What is written there (in Exod. 40:35)? “Now Moses could not enter the tent of meeting… [because the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle].” Immediately He called to Moses, as stated (in Lev. 1:1), “Then [the Lord] called unto Moses.” And it is written (in Numb. 7:89), “When Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him.” But what did He say unto him (in Numb. 8:2)? “When you set up the lamps.” 
9 Israel said (in Ps. 43:3), “Send out Your light and Your truth; they will lead me.” Great is the light of the Holy One, blessed be He! The sun and the moon give light to the world, but from where do they derive their light? They snatch some sparks of celestial light. It is so stated (in Hab. 3:11), “[Sun and moon remain on high;] they go for the light of Your arrows, for the brightness of Your shining spear.” Great is the celestial light, of which only one part in a hundred has been given to mortals. It is so stated (in Dan. 2:22), “He knows what<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>MH</i> read as <i>M’H</i> which means “a hundred.”</i> is in the darkness, and the light [dwells with Him].” Therefore [the Holy One, blessed be He, says,] “I made sun and moon so that they would give you light, as stated (in Gen. 1:17), “God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” (Numb. 8:2:) “Let the seven lamps give their light in front of the menorah”: (David) [Solomon] said (in Prov. 16:15), “In the light of the king's face there is life.” R. Jacob bar Jose said, “Joy was withheld from the wicked and given to Israel, because the Holy One, blessed be He, was obliged to dwell among flesh and blood in the light. Thus he said to them (in Numb. 8:2), ‘[Let the seven lamps] give their light in front of the menorah.’” 
10 R. Levi bar Rabbi said, “A pure menorah descended from the heavens. Because the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in Exod. 25:31), ‘And you shall make a menorah of pure gold.’ He said to Him, ‘How shall we make [it]?’ He said to him (ibid. cont.), ‘Of hammered work shall the menorah be made.’ Nevertheless Moses had difficulty; for when he descended, he had forgotten its construction.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 3:8; <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael</i>, Piska 2; <i>PRK</i> 15; <i>PR</i> 15:21; 20:4; Exod. R. 15:28.</i> He went up and said, ‘Master of the world, I have forgotten [it].’ He showed Moses, but it was still difficult for him. He said to him (in Exod. 25:40), ‘Observe and make [it].’ Thus He took a pattern of fire and showed him its construction,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Men</i>. 29a Bar.; <i>Sifre</i> Numb. 8:4 (61); Numb. R. 15:4.</i> but it was still difficult for Moses. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘Go to Bezalel and he will make it.’ [So] Moses spoke to Bezalel, [and] he made it immediately. Moses began to wonder and say, ‘In my case, how many times did the Holy One, blessed be He, show it to me; yet I had difficulty in making it. Now without seeing it, you have made it from your own knowledge. Bezalel (<i>btsl'l</i>), were you perhaps standing in (<i>b</i>) the shadow (<i>tsl</i>) of God ('<i>l</i>) when the Holy One, blessed be He, showed it to me?’ Therefore when the Temple was destroyed, the menorah was stored away.” Now this was one of the five things that were stored away: the ark, the menorah, the fire, the holy spirit, and the cherubim.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, these five things were lacking from the Second Temple. See Syr. Baruch 6:4–10; <i>TYoma</i>2:15; <i>TSot</i>. 13:1; <i>yTa‘an.</i> 2:1 (65a); <i>yHor.</i> 3:3(2) (47c); <i>Yoma</i> 21b; <i>Hor.</i> 12a; ARN, A, 41.</i> When the Holy One, blessed be He, returns in his mercy to build His house and His Temple, He will restore them to their place and cause Jerusalem to rejoice. Thus it is stated (in Is. 35:1-2), “The desert and the arid land shall be glad, and the wilderness shall rejoice and blossom like a crocus. It shall blossom abundantly and be glad.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">These five expressions of gladness in these verses correspond to the five things that will be restored in the new temple.</i>
11 (Numb. 8:5-6) “Then the Lord spoke [unto Moses saying], ‘Take the Levites’”: A legal teaching: How many strings were on the harp which the Levites played? So said R. Judah:<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>T‘Arakh</i>. 2:7; ‘<i>Arakh.</i> 13b.</i> There were seven (<i>shb'</i>) strings on that harp, as stated (in Ps. 16:11), “In Your presence there is fullness (rt.: <i>sb</i>')<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since the <i>S</i> here is a Hebrew <i>sin</i> in the unpointed text <i>SB</i>‘ is identical with <i>ShB</i>‘.</i> of joy.” Do not read [the word pointed as] <i>sova</i>' ("fullness") but [as] <i>sheva</i>' ("seven"). So also did David say (in Ps. 119:164), “With seven a day do I praise You.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">M. Pss. 81:3; <i>PR</i> 21:1. A more traditional translation of Ps. 119:164 would read: SEVEN TIMES A DAY DO I PRAISE YOU.</i> Moreover, in the days of the messiah it will be made with eight [strings]. Therefore David has stated concerning the instrumental music (in Ps. 6:1), “For the leader; with instrumental music on the eight-stringed harp.” Furthermore in the future it will be made of ten [strings] as stated (in Ps. 144:9), “O God, let me sing to You a new song; let me play for You on a ten-stringed harp.” And who ordained them? Samuel and David, as stated (in I Chron. 9:22), “David and Samuel the seer ordained them in their office of trust.” Moreover, they [were the ones who] set up the divisions for singing. Now the Levites would stand on their platform and sing before the One who spoke for the world to come into being. See the love with which the Holy One, blessed be He, loved the Levites. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “The Levites are extremely dear to Me. Take them in My name for a position of authority.” From where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 8:6), “Take the Levites.”
12 (Numb. 8:6) “Take the Levites”: This text is related (to Ps. 11:5), “The Lord tests the righteous […].” The Holy One, blessed be He, does not elevate a person to an office until He first tests and examines him. When he withstands his test, He elevates him to the office. And so you find in the case of our father Abraham; when the Holy One, blessed be He, tested him with ten temptations, he withstood his trials. Then after that He blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 24:1), “And the Lord blessed Abraham in all things.” So also in the case of Isaac, when He tested him with the days of Abimelech, he withstood the trial. Then after that He blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 26:12), “So Isaac sowed on that land […] for the Lord had blessed him.” So also in the case of Jacob, when He tested him by means of all those tribulations with Esau, with Rachel, with Dinah, with Joseph, and [with the tribulation of] how he departed from the house of his father (in Gen. 32:11), “for with [only] my staff did I cross [this] Jordan.” Then after that He blessed him. It is so stated (in Gen. 35:9), “Now God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-Aram, and blessed him.” So also in the case of Joseph, with the wife of Potiphar and he was imprisoned for twelve years. Then after that he came out and became king because he had withstood his trials. Ergo (in Ps. 11:5), “The Lord tests the righteous.” So also in the case of the tribe of Levi, they laid down their lives for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, (i.e. for martyrdom). Now when Israel was in Egypt, they had rejected the Torah and, as Ezekiel had rebuked them where it is stated (in Ezek. 20:5), “And you shall say unto them, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “In the day that I chose Israel […].”’” Then what is written at the end (in vs. 8)? “But they rebelled against Me and did not come to hearken unto Me … and I resolved to pour out My fury upon them.” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He brought darkness upon Egypt for three days, and during those [days] he killed all the wicked ones of Israel. For this reason it says (in Ezek. 20:36-38), “[As I brought your ancestors to judgment in the desert of the land of Egypt….] So will I remove from you those who rebel and transgress against Me.” So also it says (in Cant. 2:13), “And the fig tree sheds<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: <i>hanetah.</i> Although the biblical context suggests a translation such as “puts forth” or “ripens” the context understands this rare verb in a more negative sense. See <i>Tanh. (Buber); Exod. 3:7)</i>.</i> its green figs…,” these are the wicked who are in Israel; (ibid. cont.) “and the vines in blossom give off fragrance,” these are the rest who have repented and been accepted; (ibid. cont.) “arise, my beloved, my fair one, and come away,” for behold the time of redemption has arrived. However all those in the tribe of Levi were righteous and carried out the Torah. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:9), “For they observed Your word,” i.e., the Torah; (ibid. cont.) “and kept Your covenant,” i.e., circumcision. And not only that, but when Israel made the calf, the tribe of Levi did not participate there, as stated (in Exod. 32:26), “So Moses stood up on the gate of the camp and said, ‘Whoever is for the Lord come to me,’ and all the Children of Levi gathered unto him.” When Moses said (in vs. 27), “Each [of you] put his sword on his thigh…,” they immediately did so. Moreover they did not show partiality. And so Moses blesses them, [namely (according Deut. 33:9)], “The one who says of his father and mother, ‘I do not consider them’ and his brother….” When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that they all were righteous, that He had tested them and they had withstood their trial – as stated (of Levi in Deut. 33:8), “[Your faithful one,] whom You tested at Massah” – the Holy One, blessed be He, immediately said (in Numb. 8:14), “And the Levites shall belong to Me,” to fulfill what is stated (in Ps. 11:5), “The Lord tests the righteous.” In the case of the wicked, however, it is written of them (ibid. cont.), “but His soul (i.e. the soul of the Holy One, blessed be He,) hates the wicked and the lover of injustice.” David said (in Ps. 128:1), “Fortunate is everyone who fears the Lord and walks in His ways.”
13 (Numb. 10:1–2) “Then the Lord spoke [unto Moses saying, ‘Make two silver trumpets (<i>hatsotserot</i>)’”: This text is related (to Ps. 24:7), “O gates, lift up your heads, [be lifted up, you everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in].” When Solomon was bringing the ark into the Temple, he began to say, “O gates, lift up your heads...,” because the openings were [too] low. [Then] he said, “Be lifted up you everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in.” The gates said to him (in vss. 8 and 10), “Who is this king of glory? The gates immediately wanted to break his head [and would have done so,] if he had not said (in vs. 10), “The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.” Again he said (in vs. 8), “The Lord strong and mighty [...].” He said to them, “Expand yourselves, for the King of glory is coming upon you. They immediately showed Him honor (<i>kavod</i>), and raised themselves up.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Lam. R. 2:9 (13).</i> So the ark entered. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “You have shown Me honor. Upon your lives, when I destroy My house, no one will prevail against you.” You know that all the implements of the Temple went into exile in Babylon as stated (in Dan. 1:2), “Then the Lord gave King Jehoiakim of Judah into his hand, with some of the implements from the house of God; [and he brought them to the land of Shinar].” But the Temple gates were hidden in their place, as stated (in Lam. 2:9), “Her gates have sunk into the ground.” What is the meaning (of Ps. 24:10), “the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah?” That He imparts some of His glory to those who fear Him.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>PRK</i> 32:9 (= Suppl. 1:9); M. Pss. 90:1.</i> How? He is called "God" (<i>elohim</i>, a term denoting a power), and he called Moses "<i>elohim</i>," as stated (in Exod. 7:1), “See I have set you as <i>elohim</i> to Pharaoh.” He (the Holy One, blessed be He,) causes the dead to live, and he imparted some of His glory to Elijah. Thus he (i.e., Elijah) caused the dead to live, as stated (in I Kings 17:23), “and Elijah said, ‘See your son is alive.’” And He put His own clothing on the messianic king, as stated (in Ps. 21:6), “honor and majesty You shall lay upon him.” What is written [about the Holy One, blessed be He], (in Ps. 47:6)? “God has ascended amid acclamation; the Lord with the sound of a horn (<i>shofar</i>).” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “I have made you a king. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:5), ‘Then he became king in Jeshurun.’ Just as when the king goes forth, they sound trumpets before him, so also for you, (in Numb. 10:2:), ‘Make for yourself two silver trumpets.’ [This is] so that will they sound the trumpets before you when you take out and bring in Israel, as stated (Numb.10:3), ‘And they shall blow them and the whole community shall assemble before you.’” Hence (Numb. 10:2:), “Make for yourself [two silver trumpets].” 
14 Another interpretation (of Numb. 10:2), “Make for yourself two silver trumpets”: This text is related (to Prov. 24:21), “Fear the Lord, my child, and the king.” But what is the meaning of “and the king?” Simply [this, to] make Him (i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He,) king over you. Another interpretation (of Prov. 24:21), “and the king”: Crown the positive drive over the evil drive, which is called a king, where it is stated (in Eccl. 9:14), “[There was a little city with few people in it,] and a great king came against it […].”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. see above Gen. R. 11:1; 23:2; also Eccl. R. 4:13:1; 9:14:6, 9.</i> Another interpretation (of Prov. 24:21), “and the king”: Lest it be supposed that if the king says to you, “Worship an idol,” you should heed him;  the text reads (in Prov. 24:21), “Fear the Lord, my child, and the king.” Thus [when] Nebuchadnezzar told Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah to worship an idol, they did not heed him. Instead they said to him (in Dan. 3:18), “We will not serve your gods, nor will we pay homage to the image of gold which you have set up.” Nebuchadnezzar said to them (in Dan. 3:14), “’Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?’ Yesterday you were saying [that] anyone who was seeking to acquire idolatry should go to Jerusalem, as stated (Isaiah 10:10), ‘and their idols were from Jerusalem and from Samaria,’ and now you have come to make my idolatry, emptiness?” “’Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?’ Did not the Holy One, blessed be He, say this to you that you should obey royalty in whatever it tells you, where it is stated (in Eccl. 8:2), ‘I [say], “Keep the king's command?”’” They said to him, “You are king over us for taxes and crop levies;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>annona.</i></i> but in regard to the service of idols, Nebuchadnezzar and a dog [have] equal [authority].” (Dan. 3:16-17:) “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, ‘O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to answer you in this [matter]. If our God whom we serve [is able to save us, He] shall save us [from the burning fiery furnace and] from your hand O king.’” [He answered, “And if not?” They said to him, “Whether He delivers us or whether He does not deliver us (in vs. 18), ‘be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods nor pay homage to the image of gold which you have set up.’” Ergo (in Prov. 24:21), “Fear the Lord, my child, and the king.” (Prov. 24:21, cont.) “And do not associate with those who would differ” – but do not associate with those who say that there are two gods in the world, for the end of [such people] is to perish from the world. It is so stated (in Zech. 13:8), “And it shall come to pass throughout all the land, says the Lord, that two-thirds [in it] shall be cut off [and die], but one-third shall remain in it.” And who is the one-third? This is Israel as stated (in Is. 19:24), “And on that day Israel shall be a third [partner with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth].” Ergo (in Prov. 24:21), “Fear the Lord, my child, and the king.” Whoever is in fear of the Holy One, blessed be He, becomes a king. From whom did you learn [that]? From Abraham because he was in fear of the Holy One, blessed be He, and became a king. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:12), “for now I know that you fear God.” But where is it shown that he became a king? It is written (in Gen. 14:17), “[And the king of Sodom came out to meet him …] at the Valley of Shaveh, i.e., the valley of the king.” What is the meaning of the Valley of Shaveh (rt.: <i>shwh</i>?] That they all became equal (rt.: <i>shwh</i>). So taking counsel (or taking wood),<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">‘<i>Etsah.</i> The word can mean either “counsel” or “wood.”</i> they cut cedars, made a throne, and set him over them as king. And you should not say [this] only [in the case of] Abraham alone. In the case of Moses [also] he became king, because he was in fear of the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore it is written (in Prov. 24:21), “Fear the Lord, my child, and the king.” <sup class="footnote-marker">24<i class="footnote">Thus the king of whom Prov. 24:21 demands obedience, is a king who fears the Holy One like Abraham or Moses.</i> </sup>
15 (Numb. 10:2) “Make two silver trumpets.”:<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The context of the passage concerns the sounding of an alarm in time of war.</i> That they should blow the trumpets in front of you like a king. (Numb. 10:2 translated literally:) “Make for yourself (<i>lekha</i>),” [i.e.,] at your own expense (literally: from what belongs to you [<i>lekha</i>]). (Ibid.:) “Make for yourself.” For yourself you shall make [them] and not for others. You are to use them, and no one else is to use them. You yourself know that in the case of his disciple Joshua, he did not use those [trumpets] but horns (shofars). When they came to fight against Jericho, there gathered in Jericho seven peoples. It is so stated (in Josh. 24:11), “When you crossed the Jordan and came unto Jericho, the citizens of Jericho, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites fought against you, and I delivered them into your hands.” Did seven peoples make up the citizens of Jericho? R. Samuel bar Nahmani said, “Jericho was the door bolt [for unlocking] the land of Israel. They said, ‘If Jericho is conquered, the whole land will be conquered immediately.’ For that reason seven peoples gathered within it.” What is written (in Josh. 6:20)? “So the people shouted when [the priests] blew on the horns.” [This] teaches that even though Joshua was [Moses'] disciple, he did not use them (i.e. the silver trumpets). Moreover you should not say [this only] about Joshua but even [about] our master Moses, [in that the trumpets] were hidden while he was [still] alive. R. Isaac said, “Note that when Moses was going to depart this world, he said (in Deut. 31:28), ‘Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes [and your officials].’ But where were the trumpets, to blow on them for [those people] to gather.’ It is simply that [it was already] while he was [still] alive that they were hidden.” R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi, “It was to fulfill what was said (in Eccl. 8:8), ‘nor is there control on the day of death….’” Ergo (in Numb. 10:2), “Make for yourself....” Make it for yourself, but no one else shall use them all the days of your life. 
16 Another interpretation (of Numb. 10:2), “Make for yourself”: You are to use them because you are a king, but another is not to use them except King David, as stated (in II Chron. 29:26, 28), “And the Levites stood… the song was sung and the trumpets were blown.” Rav said, “The trumpets that were in the sanctuary were also hidden, but King David used the harp, as stated (in Ps. 57:9), ‘Awake, my glory; awake, O lyre and harp.’” R. Pinchas bar Hama the Priest said, “A harp was hanging above David's bed.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yBer.</i> 1:1 (2d); <i>Ber.</i> 3:b; <i>PRK</i> 7:4; <i>PR</i> 17:3; M. Pss. 22:8; Ruth R. 6:1; Lam. R. 2:19 (22).</i> When midnight arrived, a north wind would blow strongly on it, and it would play of its own accord. Immediately David and the students would arise to occupy themselves with the Torah; and driving sleep from their eyes, they would meditate on the Torah until the dawn arose. Therefore, David said (ibid.), ‘Awake, my glory.’ It is customary for the dawn to awaken the people, but (ibid. cont.) ‘I will awaken the dawn.’” Another interpretation (of Ps. 57:9), “Awake my, glory”: What is the meaning of “my glory?” [My glory is] due to the service of my Creator. For the [evil] drive would say to him, “David, are you not a king? It is customary for kings to arise at three hours into the day; so why are you arising at midnight?” Then [David] said to it, “Empty is my glory. My glory is nothing before the glory of my Creator.” It is therefore stated, “Awake my glory (words which can also be rendered: empty is ['<i>urah</i>] my glory.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The form ‘<i>urah</i> can be either a simple imperative (AWAKE) from the root ‘<i>WR</i> or a past intensive passive (WAS EMPTY) from the root ‘<i>RH</i>.</i> (Ps. 119:62:) “At midnight I will arise to praise You.” David said, “It is my duty to arise at midnight and to praise You for the wonders that You have done with my ancestor (Ruth) at midnight.” It is so stated (in Ruth 3:8–9), “Now it came to pass at midnight that the man was startled, [so he turned aside, and here was a woman lying at his feet. Then he said, ‘Who are you?’] And she said, ‘I am your handmaid Ruth.’” And he said to her, “Lodge for the night.” R. Joshuah ben Levi beRabbi Shalom said, “She said to him, ‘Are you sending me away with [mere] words?’ He said to her (Ruth 3:13) ‘”As the Lord lives,” I am not sending you away with [mere] words.’” (Ruth 3:13:) “As the Lord lives”: [This oath] teaches that he had imposed an oath on his [evil] drive, which was inciting him by saying to him, “You are an unmarried man and she is an unmarried woman. Now is the opportunity that you require.” Immediately this righteous man swore, “As the Lord lives, I am not touching her [tonight].” And not only Boaz, but all the righteous impose an oath on their [evil] drive. Thus you find it so with David, for when Saul fell into his hands, what did David say (in I Sam. 26:10)? “And David said, ‘As the Lord lives, the Lord shall smite him; either he will die when his day comes [or he will go down and perish in battle; the Lord forbid that I lay my hand on the Lord's anointed].’” Why did he swear two times? R. Samuel bar Nahman said, “His [evil] drive came and said to him, ‘If you had fallen into his hand, he would have shown you no mercy and killed you. [Moreover] according to the Torah it is permissible to kill him – one who comes to kill you, rise up and kill him – since here he is pursuing [you].’ He therefore hastened to swear two times, ‘As the Lord lives, I will not kill him.’” Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the universe, You know the power of the evil drive, how strong it is.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “Remove it a little in this world, and I will take it away from you in the future.” Thus it is stated (in Is. 62:10), “build up, complete the highway<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The biblical text renders, BUILD UP, BUILD UP THE HIGHWAY.</i> [take away some stone (i.e. the evil drive)]!” It also says (in Is. 57:14), “Build up, build up; clear out a way; remove an obstacle (i.e. the evil drive) from the way of my people!” Then in the world to come I will root it out of you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26), “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh.” 
17 Thus has R. Tanhuma bar Abba interpreted. (Numb. 11:16) “Then the Lord said unto Moses, ‘Gather Me seventy men from the elders of Israel….” A legal teaching: Within how many cubits is one obligated to stand up in the presence of an elder? Thus have our masters taught: Within four cubits one is obligated to stand up in the presence of an elder.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Qid</i> 33b; cf also <i>yBik.</i> 3:3 (65c).</i> Thus it is stated (in Lev. 19:32), “You shall rise in the presence of<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">To be in one’s presence is to be within four cubits.</i> a gray head [...].” One also asks after his welfare [when] within four cubits. And about which honor did the Torah say (ibid. cont.), “you shall honor the presence of an elder?” That one should not stand in his place or sit in his place or contradict his words. Also when one asks [about] a law (<i>halakhah</i>), one should ask with reverence and not rush to respond or interrupt his words. Whoever does not behave toward his teacher (<i>rav</i>) according to all these rules is labeled a wicked person before the Omnipresent, his learning is forgotten, his years are shortened, and in the end he comes to poverty, as stated (in Eccl. 8:13), “It shall not go well with the wicked one, nor shall he prolong his days; [they are] like a shadow, because he is not in fear before God.” In regard to this fear I do not know [exactly] what it is; [but] when it says (in Lev. 19:32), “You shall rise in the presence of a gray head, [you shall honor the presence of an elder,] and you shall fear your God,” note that it is [really] saying, this is the fear of [students toward] sages.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Since GRAY HEAD and ELDER are understood to refer to the sages.</i> [But I might say that this is a fear of] usury and of [false] weights, as fear is stated about them [also].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In Lev. 25:36; 19:36. So why say that it refers to a sage?</i> It is simply that R. Elazar has said, “It is stated here, ‘[you shall honor] the presence (<i>pny</i>) of the elder, and you shall fear your God’; while it is stated in the other passage (in Eccl. 8:13), ‘he is not in fear before (<i>pny</i>) God.’” Hence, one is obligated to greet him before everyone when entering and leaving and to treat him with fear and honor. It is so stated (in Deut. 6:13), “You shall fear (<i>et</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This word generally denotes that what follows is a direct object but at times the word means “along with.” In this latter sense the <i>et</i> implies that one should honor someone along with the Lord your God. For an example of <i>et</i> indicating further inclusions, see <i>Tanh</i>. (Buber) Gen. 1:8.</i> the Lord your God.” And we have learned, “[The <i>et</i> must refer] to [fear of] the master scholars of Torah since you have no other trait like it.” And so it says (in Deut. 1:15), “[So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and well-known people,] and appointed them heads over you.” From here you learn that you should treat him in a princely manner, [i.e.,] stand in his presence, and give him precedence in every matter of dignity. R. Abba bar Pappa the Priest said, “When I would see a certain group of people, I would walk by another route so as not to be a bother for them, lest they see me and stand for me. [However] when I told of the matter to R. Jose ben R. Zevida, he said to me, ‘You must pass before them, so that they will see you and stand in your presence. Then you will bring them to the point of fearing Heaven, as stated (in Lev. 19:32), “You shall rise in the presence of a gray head, [you shall honor the presence of an elder,] and you shall fear your God.”’” Why? Because the rise of the righteous is a rise in which there is no decline. But the rise of Esau<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Esau stands for any Roman.</i> the wicked is a rise which is wholly decline. Today he is a governor;<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>eparchos.</i></i> tomorrow an assistant [governor]; the next day a captain.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>stratiotes</i> (“citizen soldier”).</i> And thus it is with all their great ones. So also the prophet says (in Obad. 1:4), “Though you make your abode as high as the eagle, [and though your nest is set among the stars, I will bring you down from there].” The rise of Jacob, however, is a rise which has no decline, and their holiness is never desecrated. And so you find that the elders are one of thirteen things which are written down [as belonging] to the name of the Holy One, blessed be He. These [thirteen] are the following: (1) The silver and gold, (2) the priests, (3) the Levites, (4) Israel, (5) the first-born, (6) the altar, (7) the priestly share, (8) the oil for anointing, (9) the tent of meeting, (10) the Davidic dynasty, (11) the offerings, (12) the Land of Israel, and (13) the elders. Where is it shown in reference to silver and gold? As stated (in Hag. 2:8), “The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine.” Where is it shown in reference to the priests? As stated (in Exod. 29:1), “to sanctify them for serving Me as priests.” Where is it shown in reference to the Levites? As stated (in Numb. 3:12), “and the Levites shall be Mine.” Where is it shown in reference to Israel? As stated (in Lev. 25:55), “For to Me the Children of Israel [are servants].” Where is it shown in reference to the first-born? As stated (in Numb. 3:13 = 8:17), “For all the first-born are Mine.” Where is it shown in reference to the altar? As stated (in Exod. 20:21), “An altar of earth you shall make for Me.” Where is it shown in reference to the priestly share? As stated (in Exod. 25:2), “And let them take for Me a priestly share.” Where is it shown in reference to the oil for anointing? As stated (in Exod. 30:31), “This oil for anointing shall be holy to Me.” Where is it shown in reference to the tent of meeting? As stated (in Exod. 25:8), “And let them make Me a sanctuary.” Where is it shown in reference to offerings? As stated (in Numb. 28:2), “My offering, My bread for My fire offering.”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Note that this reference to offerings and the following reference to the Davidic dynasty are reversed in order from the list given above.</i> Where is it shown in reference to the Davidic dynasty? As stated (in I Sam. 16:1), “for I have chosen a king for Myself among his (i.e. Jesse's) sons.” Where is it shown in reference to the Land [of Israel]? As stated (in Lev. 25:23), “for the land belongs to Me.” Where is it shown in reference to the elders? As stated (in Numb. 11:16), “Gather Me seventy men [from the elders of Israel].”
18 (Numb. 11:16) “Gather Me seventy men”: This text is related (to Amos. 9:6), “Who builds His upper chambers in the heavens and founds His celestial vault (<i>aguddah</i>) upon earth.” To what is the matter comparable? <sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Sifre</i> to Deut. 33:5 (346).</i> To a palace<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>palatium.</i></i> that was built upon boat[s]. For as long a time that the boats are connected, the palace that is upon them will stand. Hence, it is stated (in Amos 9:6), “Who builds His upper chambers in the heavens.” When is His throne, as it were, established<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the Gk. noun <i>basis</i> which means “ground” or “pedestal.”</i> above?<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See M. Sam. 5.</i> When Israel becomes one society (<i>aguddah</i>). It is therefore stated (ibid.), “Who builds His upper chambers in the heavens.” When? When (ibid. cont.) “He founds His celestial vault (<i>aguddah</i>, which also means society) upon earth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Men.</i> 27a.</i> And so it says (in Deut. 33:5), “Then He became King in Jeshurun [when the heads of the people assembled, the tribes of Israel together].” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16), “Gather Me seventy men.” Why? Because a gathering of righteous people is enjoyment for them and enjoyment for the world, but a gathering of wicked people is an offense to them and an offense to the world.
19 Another interpretation (of Numb. 11:16), “Gather Me seventy men [from the elders of Israel]”: When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Gather Me seventy men,” Moses said, “How shall I manage to get [them] from all the tribes?<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 11:24-26 (95).</i> If I get five each from every tribe, they will not add up to the number seventy. There will [only] be sixty. And if we get six each from every tribe, they will add up to the number seventy-two. But if I get five from one tribe and six from another, I shall be imposing jealousy among the tribes.” What did Moses do? He took seventy-two pieces of paper and wrote “elder” on them plus two other blank pieces of paper. Then he mixed them up and put them in the urn. He said to them, “Come and take your papers.” If a paper with ‘elder’ written on it came up in [a person's] hand he knew that he had been appointed an elder, but if a blank one came up in his hand he knew that he had not been appointed. Then the officer-in-charge would say to him, “Look there is another paper there with ‘elder’ written upon it. If you had been worthy of being appointed, [a paper with ‘elder’] would have come up in your hand.” When [Moses had followed this procedure] the elders were appointed. Eldad and Medad were there, but they excluded themselves. [They said,] “We are not worthy to be in the number of the elders.” Now because they excluded themselves, they were found [to have become] superior to the elders in five respects. The elders only prophesied for the morrow as stated (in Numb. 11:18), “And you shall say to the people, ‘Purify yourselves for the morrow,’” but these men prophesied what was going to happen at the end of forty years as stated (in Numb. 11:26), “But two men had remained in the camp; [the name of the one was Eldad and the name of the other was Medad…; and they were…] prophesying in the camp.” But what were they prophesying? Some say [they were prophesying] about the downfall of Gog, while others say [they were prophesying that] Moses would die and Joshua would bring Israel into the Land. You yourself know that they so prophesied, since it is what Joshua told Moses (in vs. 28), “Then Joshua ben Nun, Moses' attendant from his youth, answered.” And it is written (in vs. 27), “But a lad ran and told Moses.” And who was it? It was Moses' son, Gershom. The elders did not enter the land, but these did enter the land. Eldad is [so listed] (in Numb. 34:21) [as] Elidad ben Chislon. Medad is [so listed] (in Numb. 34:24) [as] Kemuel ben Shiphtan. The elders were not designated by their names, [but these were designated by their names]. The elders had their prophecy cease, since their prophecy was from what belonged to Moses, even as the Scripture has said (in Numb. 11:17), “and I will set aside some of the spirit which is upon you and put it on them”; but these [two] had their prophecy from that which belonged to the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Numb. 11:26), “and the spirit rested upon them.” Now if you say, “Since the elders had their prophecy from what belonged to Moses, might it not have lessened his prophecy somewhat?” [The answer is] no. To what may Moses be compared? To a lamp which was lit and<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 11:17 (93).</i> everyone lights up from it; yet its light is in no way diminished. So also in the case of Moses. Although the prophets took of his prophecy, the prophecy of Moses was in no way diminished. [It is so stated] (in Deut. 34:10), “And never again did there arise in Israel a prophet like Moses.”
20 (Numb. 11:16) “Gather Me seventy men”: Did they not have elders in the past? Was it not already stated in Egypt (in Exod. 3:16), “Go and gather the elders of Israel?” So for what reason had the Holy One, blessed be He, said (in Numb. 11:16), “Gather Me seventy men?” [It was] to teach you that when Pharaoh had said (in Exod. 1:10), “Come let us act shrewdly [...],” Pharaoh gathered all Israel, and said to them, “Please work with me as a favor today.” This is what is written (in vs. 13), “So the Egyptians made the Children of Israel labor with ruthlessness (<i>befarekh</i>).” What is the meaning of “with ruthlessness (<i>befarekh</i>)?” With gentle speech (<i>befeh rakh</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is interpreting Exod. 1:13 to mean, SO THE EGYPTIANS MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL LABOR WITH GENTLE SPEECH. So <i>Sot</i>. 11ab; Exod. R. 1:11.</i> Pharaoh took a basket and trowel; who [could] see Pharaoh taking basket and trowel, and working with bricks and not [also] work? Israel immediately went quickly, and applied all their strength along with him all the day, because they were strong and mighty. When it grew dark, he posted taskmasters over them. He said to them, “Reckon the [number of] bricks.” They immediately arose and counted them. He said to them, “This many you shall produce for me each and every day.” He assigned Egyptian taskmasters over the officers of Israel, and the officers were assigned over the rest of the people. Moreover when he said to them (in Exod. 5:7), “You shall no longer give the people straw,” the taskmasters came and counted the bricks. [If] they [the bricks] were found deficient, the taskmasters beat the officers, as stated (in Exod. 5:14), “And the officers of the Children of Israel, [whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh had set over them,] were beaten….” When the officers were beaten for the rest of the people, they did not hand them over into the hands of the taskmasters, for they said, “It is better for us to be beaten than that the rest of the people falter.” Therefore when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16), “Gather Me seventy men,” Moses said, “My Master, I do not know who is worthy and who is not worthy.” He said to him (in Numb. 11:16 cont.), “Whom you know to be elders and officers of the people.” These are the officers who had handed themselves over to be beaten on their behalf in Egypt because of the required amount of bricks. Let them come and receive this dignity. It therefore says (ibid.), “whom you know to be elders and officers of the people.” Because they handed themselves over to be beaten for the community, therefore (in Numb. 11:16 cont.), “they shall lead with you in leading the people.” This is to teach you that the Holy One, blessed be He equated them with Moses. [From here] you learn that whoever hands himself over for the sake of Israel merits dignity, greatness and the holy spirit. It is therefore written (ibid.) “whom you know [to be elders and officers of the people.” From the ones of whom it is written (in Exod. 5:14), “And the officers of the Children of Israel [whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh had set over them] were beaten.”
21 (Numb. 11:16) “Gather Me seventy men from the elders of Israel”: But where were those former ones? This text is related (to Job 34:24), “He shatters mighty ones without inquiry and raises up others in their stead.” When Israel was in Egypt, they had seventy elders as stated (in Exod. 3:16), “Go and gather the elders of Israel”; and with them they went out of Egypt. [Moreover] when Moses went up [on Sinai] to receive the Torah, they were [still] with him, as stated (in Exod. 24:9), “Then there went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel,” [and then] (in Exod. 24:14) “But unto the elders he had said, ‘Wait [for us] here […].’” When Moses had gone up, he had agreed with Israel to come down at the end of forty days. When he delayed coming down, all Israel came together to the elders. [He delayed,] even as it is stated (in Exod. 32:1), “When the people saw that Moses delayed (<i>boshesh</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Shab.</i> 89a.</i> Now <i>boshesh</i> can only mean a delay since it is stated (in Judg. 5:28), “Why is his chariot late (<i>boshesh</i>) in coming; why are the hoof-beats of his chariots delaying?” They said to them, Moses agreed with us that he would come down in forty days. Now here it is forty days and he has not come down. And in addition, six hours more [have passed];<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Exod. R. 41:7, which derives <i>boshesh</i> from <i>ba’u shesh,</i> which means: “Six hours have come.” See Gen. R. 18:6.</i> yet we do not know what has happened to him. So (in the words of Exod. 32:1 cont.) ‘Arise and make a god for us […].’” When they heard that, they said to them, “Why are you angering Him, you for whom He performed all the miracles and wonders?” [But] they did not heed them and killed them. Then because Hur had stood ('<i>md</i>) up to them with harsh words, they (rt.: '<i>md</i>) rose up against him and killed him [as well]. Then all of Israel gathered around Aaron with great pomp, as stated (ibid.), “and the people gathered unto Aaron...,” [saying,] “Get up! Why are you sitting? Get up!” R. Isaac said, “The holy spirit cried out (as in Psalms 26:5), ‘I detest the company of evil men.’” [They said to him] (again in the words of Exod. 32:1 cont.) “’Arise and make a god for us’; and if not, ‘as (like) this,’ we will do like this to you. In the same way that we rose up against Hur and killed him, so will we do to you, [if you prevent us from our demand].” Once Aaron saw what they did to the elders and to Hur, he was very afraid, as stated (Exodus 32:5), “And Aaron saw and he built an altar <i>(vayiven mizbeach)</i> in front of it,” [meaning that] he understood from the one killed before him <i>(vayiven me’mi she’zavuach lefaniv)</i>. Where is it shown that they killed the elders and Hur?<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">On the killing of Hur, see also <i>Tanh</i>. Exod. 8:10; Exod. R. 42:1; 48:3; 51:8; Lev. R. 10:2; Numb. R. 9:45; <i>PRE</i> 45.</i> Where Jeremiah rebuked Israel, as stated (in Jer. 2:34), “On your skirts there is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor; you did not find them breaking in; yet for of all these.” What is the significance of “for all these (<i>elleh</i>)?” [It is] because of (the statement in Exod. 32:4), “These (<i>elleh</i>) are your gods O Israel.” What [punishment] did He repay them? (As stated in Exod. 32:35), “Then the Lord sent a plague upon the people.” After a time, when the Holy One, blessed be He, had forgiven them, He said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16), “Gather Me seventy men, in place of those who were killed for the sanctification of My name.” That is what is written (in Job 34:24), “He shatters mighty ones without inquiry and raises up others in their stead.”
22 (Numb. 11:16:) “Gather Me seventy men”: This text is related (to Eccl. 12:11), “The words of the wise are like goads (<i>kedarbanot</i>) [...].” <i>Kedarbanot</i> [signifies] <i>kadur shel banot</i> (a ball for girls). Just like a ball for girls is thrown here and there, so were the words [of Torah] thrown at Sinai. Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:11 cont.), “and like implanted nails”: From here the sages have said, “It is forbidden to read in the profane (<i>chitzoniot</i>) books.” It is therefore stated (ibid.), “implanted nails.” [“Like nails (<i>msmrwt</i>)” – this is to teach that] just as the watches (<i>mshmrwt</i>) of the priests number twenty-four, so also do the books [of the Bible] number twenty-four.”  (Ibid. cont.:) [“(The masters of) collections.”] These [masters] are the Sanhedrin.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synedrion.</i></i> And if you say, “This person permits what another forbids, this one declares unfit what another declares fit, this one declares unclean what another declares clean, R. Eliezer obligates while R. Joshua exempts, and Bet Shammai prohibits while Bet Hillel permits; to whom should I listen?” [That is why] the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Nevertheless (according to Eccl. 12:11 end) ‘all of them were given from one shepherd.’” 
23 (Numb. 11:16) “Gather Me seventy man (<i>sic</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is ignoring the fact that Hebrew uses singular nouns with large numbers in order to build an interpretation on this singular usage.</i> from the elders of Israel”: This text is related (to Prov. 22:11), “The one who loves purity of heart has grace on his lips, has a king as his friend.” Why did He not say to him (in Numb. 11:16), “seventy men" (with "men" in the plural), instead of “seventy man.” It is simply that He said to him, “seventy man (<i>ish</i>) [with the singular <i>ish</i> indicating] singular individuals,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. singular individuals like the one described in Prov. 22:11.</i> because they were to be like Me and you, as stated (Exod. 15:3:) “The Lord is a Man (<i>ish</i>) of war,” and [it is likewise stated about] Moses (Numb. 12:3), “Now the man (<i>ish</i>) Moses was very humble.” 
24 (Numb. 11:16) “Gather Me [seventy men from the elders of Israel]”: But did you not have elders before? Here now it is written concerning Mount Sinai (in Exod. 24:9), “Then there went up Moses […] and the seventy elders of Israel”; and this <i>parashah</i> (with Numb. 11:16) comes after that. So where were the[se earlier] elders? It is simply that, when Israel did those things which are stated (in Numb. 11:1), “Now the people were as murmurers […] then the fire of the Lord burned against them,” they were all destroyed by fire at that time. It is simply that their burning was like the burning of Nadab and Abihu, for they also had acted with disrespect on ascending Sinai, when they saw the Divine Presence. It is so stated (in Exod. 24:11), “they beheld God, and they ate and drank.” Was there eating and drinking there? To what is the matter comparable? To a servant who attended his master while [holding] a slice of bread in his hand and taking bites from it. Similarly had they acted with disrespect as though eating and drinking. So the elders along with Nadab and Abihu deserved to be destroyed by fire on that day; but because the giving of Torah was dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, He therefore did not want to harm them and bring calamity to them on that day. This is what is written (ibid.), “But He (the Holy One, blessed be He,) did not raise His hand against the nobles of the Children of Israel.” From this you may infer that they deserved to have a hand raised [against them]. After a time, however, He collected their debt: Nadab and Abihu were also destroyed by fire as they entered the tent of meeting, while the elders were destroyed by fire when they were filled with lusting, as stated (in Numb. 11:4), “Then the rabble (<i>ha'safsuf</i>) which was in their midst became filled with lust.” Who were the rabble (<i>ha'safsuf</i>)? R. Simeon ben Menasya and R. Simeon bar Abba [differed on the matter]. One said, “These were the proselytes who came up with them from Egypt and who were gathered (<i>ne'esafim</i>) together with them as stated (in Exod. 12:38), ‘And a mixed multitude went up with them.’” But the other said, “Rabble can only be a Sanhedrin, since it is stated (in Numb. 11:16), ‘Gather (<i>esfah</i>) Me seventy men.’” What [else] is written there (in Numb. 11:1)? “Then the fire of the Lord burned against them and consumed them in the outskirts (<i>qetseh</i>) of the camp,” [i.e.,] among the selected (<i>muqetsim</i>) in the camp. And where is it shown that those elders who went up onto the mountain were destroyed by fire? Where it is stated (in Ps. 106:18), “And fire broke out in their company ('<i>edah</i>),” since company ('<i>edah</i>) can only be a Sanhedrin as stated (in Numb. 15:24), “And it shall come to pass that if it was done [by mistake] away from the eyes of the congregation ('<i>edah</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">I.e. the leaders of the congregation. So Rashi on Numb. 15:24.</i> It is also written (in Lev. 4:13), “And if the whole congregation ('<i>edah</i>) of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">This expression was often interpreted as denoting the Sanhedrin. So <i>Sifra</i> to Lev. 4:13 (42: <i>Wayyiqra parashah</i> 4); R. Meir in <i>Hor.</i> 5a; Rashi on Lev. 4:13.</i> should err.” And likewise it says (in Ps. 78:31), “When God’s anger flared up at them, He slew their sturdiest,” these were the Sanhedrin; “struck down the chosen of Israel,” these were the chosen ones that were called elders, about whom it is written (in II Sam. 6:1), “And David still added to the chosen among Israel.” Then they wept again and demanded meat. Now you might say, “What they wanted was animal flesh? Did it not come about that the manna became whatever they wanted inside of their mouths, as stated (in Ps. 106:15), ‘So He gave them what they asked for...’?” And in case you should say that they did not have oxen and cattle in the desert, has it not already stated (in Exod. 12:38), “And a mixed multitude went up with them and flocks and herds.” And in case you should say they ate them in the desert, is it not written (in Numb. 32:1), “Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had much livestock?” From here R. Simeon said, “It was not meat for which they lusted, since it says so (in Ps. 78:27) – ‘And He rained down flesh (<i>she'er</i>) upon them like dust.’ Now <i>she'er</i> must denote illicit intercourse since it is stated (in Lev. 18:6), ‘None of you shall approach any close (<i>she'er</i>) relation to him.’ Ergo, it [really] says that they desired to permit illicit intercourse for themselves; and so it says (in Numb. 11:10), ‘Now Moses heard the people weeping for their families.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Yoma</i> 75a according to which they were weeping here because of the family relations with whom they were forbidden to have intercourse.</i> Thus when they desired such [relations] (ibid. cont.), “the Lord was very angry and it was bad in the eyes of Moses.” At that time Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, (in vs. 11), “’Why have you mistreated Your servant […]?’ In the past there was one with me who would bear the burden of Israel, but now I am alone.” Thus it is written (in vs. 14-15), “I am not able to bear [all] this people alone…. So if You are dealing like this with me, please truly kill me.” At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Appoint other elders instead of those elders.” It is so stated] (in vs. 16), “Gather Me seventy men.” 
25 (Numb. 11:17:) “Then I will come down and speak with you there”: [This verse is] to inform you that the day for appointing elders was as dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, as the day for the giving of Torah. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:11), “for on the third day the Lord will come down”; and also (in Numb. 11:17) with reference to appointing the elders, “I will come down,” is written. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and hired a guard for it. Then he gave him the payment of a guard for him to guard the orchard. After a time the guard said to him, “I cannot guard all of it myself. Rather give me others to guard it with me.” The king said to him, “I have given the entire orchard into your keeping, and I have given you all [the payment] for guarding it; but now you would say to me, ‘Go and bring others to guard it with me.’ See I am bringing others to guard with you, but observe that I am not giving them their payment from what belongs to me. Rather it is from your payment which I have given you that they are receiving their payment.” Similarly did the Holy One, blessed be He, speak to Moses. When [Moses] said to Him, “I cannot [do everything] alone,” the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I have given you understanding and knowledge to sustain<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRNS</i>. Cf. Gk.: <i>pronoos</i> (“prudent”).</i> My children. Moreover, I did not want others, simply so that you would have strength and knowledge and so that you would stand alone in that greatness. But [now] you are the one who wants another. Be aware that they will receive [payment], not from what is Mine, but from what is yours.” It is so stated (in Numb. 11:17.), “and I will set aside some of the spirit which is upon you and put it on them [...].” Nevertheless Moses did not lack anything. You should know that after forty years He said to Moses (in Numb. 27:18, 20), “Take Joshua ben Nun …. And put some of your glory upon him.” Then what is written about Joshua (in Deut. 34:9)? “Now Joshua ben Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom.” Why? (Ibid. cont.:) “Because Moses had laid his hands upon him.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world [only] individuals have prophesied, but in the world to come all Israel shall become prophets.” It is so stated (in Joel 3:1), “And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh so that your sons and your daughters and your elders shall prophesy, etc.”<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"> Cf. Deut. R. 6:14.</i> So did R. Tanchuma beRabbi Abba expound.

Chapter 16

1 A legal teaching: Is it permitted to set sail on the Great Sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) three days before the Sabbath? Our masters taught (in Shab. 19a): One does not set sail in a ship on the Great Sea three days before the Sabbath, when one wants to go to a distant place. If, however, one desires to set sail from Tyre to Sidon, for example, it is permitted for one to set sail even on the Sabbath eve, because it is a known fact that one can go [there] while it is still daylight. Now these words concern agents with freedom of action; but in the case of agents for [carrying out] a commandment, it is permitted for [such a] one to set sail on whatever day he wants. Why? Because he is an agent for [carrying out] a commandment, and an agent for [carrying out] a commandment overrides the Sabbath. And so you find with reference to the sukkah that they have taught (in <i>Suk.</i> 2:4), “Agents for [carrying out] a religious duty are exempted from [the requirements of] the sukkah.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Suk.</i> 25a (bar).</i> You have none so dear to the Holy One, blessed be He, as an agent, when he is sent to carry out a religious duty and is risking his life to succeed in it. And you have none who were sent to carry out a religious duty and who risked their lives to succeed in their mission like those two whom Joshua ben Nun sent. Thus it is stated (in Josh. 2:1), “Then Joshua ben Nun sent two [spies] from Shittim [secretly, saying]….” Who were they? Our masters have taught, “These were Phinehas and Caleb.” They had gone and risked their lives in order to be successful in their mission. What is the implication of secretly (<i>heresh</i>)? That they made themselves out to be potters and cried, “Here are pots. Whoever wants [some], let him come and buy.” [Their ruse was] so that no one would notice them. [Hence secretly (<i>heresh</i>) is written [in this verse,] but read it [as] clay (<i>heres</i>), (from which pots are made). [They had made themselves out to be potters] lest people say that they were spies. (Ibid., cont.) “So they went and came to the house of a woman who was a harlot whose name was Rahab […]”: She arose and received them. The king of Jericho became aware of them and heard that they had come to investigate the whole land, as stated (in vs. 2), “But it was told the king of Jericho [….].” When they came to look for them, what did Rahab do? She took them away to hide them. Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, and the priests are comparable to the angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>), as stated (in Mal. 2:7), “For the lips of a priest preserve knowledge, and they seek Torah from his mouth, because he is a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord of hosts.” Now an angel desiring [to be visible] is visible; and one desiring [to be invisible] is not visible. And from where is it known that the prophets are also comparable to angels. As so is it stated about Moses (in Numb. 20:16), “and he sent a messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) who brought us out of Egypt.” And was it an angel? And was he not Moses? Hence the prophets are likened to angels (<i>mal'akhim</i>). And so too is it stated (in Jud. 2:1), “An angel (<i>mal'akh</i>) of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, ‘I brought you up from Egypt…” And was he not Phinehas? It is simply that from here [it is shown] that the prophets are called angels. Hence Phinehas said to her, “I am a priest, and I do not need to hide. Hide my colleague, Caleb, and I will stand in front of them but they will not see me.” And so did she do, as stated (in Josh. 2:4), “So the woman took the two men [and hid <i>him</i>].” It does not say, “hid them,” but rather “hid him<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Him</i> is a literal translation of the Masoretic text.</i>” Behold that she did not hide Phinehas, but rather [only] Caleb. [This is] to teach you how much these two righteous men risked themselves to fulfill their mission. But the agents whom Moses sent were wicked. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in Numb. 13:2) “Send men.”
2 This text is related (to Ps. 76:6), “The stout-hearted were despoiled; they were asleep in their slumber.” (Ibid.) “The stout-hearted were despoiled,” namely Moses and Aaron. After they sent out the spies, these came and made an evil report about the land, and they did not know what to do. Actually, even Moses and Aaron were negligent [over the report]. Immediately Caleb stood up and silenced all those hosts,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> as stated (in Numb. 13:30), “Then Caleb hushed the people before Moses.” He stood on a stool<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Safsal</i>; cf. Lat.: <i>subsellium.</i></i> and had them become silent. Then he said to them, “Hush.” So they became silent in order to hear from him. He said to them (in Numb. 14:7), “The land […] is very very good.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “I am exceedingly grateful to Caleb.” It is so stated (in Deut. 1:36), “Except Caleb ben Jephunneh.” What is the meaning of “except (<i>zwlty</i>)?” This one is with Me (<i>lzh wh'ty</i>) (more) than sixty myriads of you. You did not find your hands (i.e., your courage); therefore you stumbled. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 76:6), “The stout-hearted were despoiled.” Why all this? Because they were foolish agents. It is with reference to them that Solomon has said (in Prov. 26:6), “The one who sends a message through a fool is cutting off [his own] feet and drinking violence.”
3 (Numb. 13:2) “Send men”: R. Aha the Great opened [his discourse] (with Is. 40:8), “Grass withers, flowers fade, but the word of our God shall stand forever.” To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend. Now he made an agreement with him and said to him, “Come with me, and I will give you a present.” He went with him but died. The king said to the son of his friend, “Although your father has died, I am not withdrawing the present that I had promised to give him. Come and get it.” This king is the Holy One, blessed be He, and the friend is Abraham, as stated (in Is. 41:8), “the seed of My friend Abraham.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Come with me,” as stated (in Gen. 12:1), “Go from your land….” He made an agreement with him to give him a present, as stated (in Gen. 13:17), “Arise, walk about the land [… for I am giving it to you].” It also says (in vs. 15), “For all the land which you see, [to you will I give it, and to your seed forever].” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Although the ancestors have died, I had agreed with them to give them the land. I am not going back on [My word].” Instead (as in Numb. 13:2), “Send men.” Ergo (according to Is. 40:8), “but the word of our God shall stand forever.”
4 (Numb. 13:2) “Send men for yourself”:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash here understands the verse in this more literal sense.</i> This text is related (to Prov. 10:26), “Like vinegar to the teeth and like smoke to the eyes, so is the lazy person to those who send him.” The spies were notable, in that they spoke evil speech against the land, as stated (in Jer. 9:2), “For they have bent their tongues as a bow of falsehood, [and it is not for truth that they have grown mighty in the land.]” To what is the matter comparable? To a wealthy man who had a vineyard. Whenever he saw that the wine was good, he would say to his tenants, “Put it in my house”; but whenever he saw that it was sour, he would say to his tenants, “Put it in your houses.” So also here. When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that the elders were worthy, he called them in His own name, as stated (in Numb. 11:16), “Gather me seventy men [from the elders of Israel].” When He saw that the spies were going to sin, he called them by Moses' name, as stated (in Numb. 13:2), “Send men for yourself.” 
5 This text is related (to Prov. 26:6), “The one who sends a message through a fool is cutting off [his own] feet and drinking violence.” And were the spies fools? And has it not already been stated (in Numb. 13:2) “Send men (<i>anashim</i>).” And in every place that <i>anashim</i> is used, the men are righteous. Where is this shown? For so it says (in Exod. 17:9), “Then Moses said to Joshua, ‘Choose men (<i>anashim</i>) for us.’” And so it says (in I Sam. 17:12), “and in the days of Saul the man (Jesse) had come to an elderly age among men (<i>anashim</i>).” And so it [also] says (in I Sam. 1:11), “and if you grant your handmaid the seed of men (<i>anashim</i>).” Now you are calling these [spies] fools? But these were only called fools because they had uttered malicious slander against the land, as stated (in Prov. 10:18), “and the one who utters slander is a fool.” But nevertheless they had [once] been great human beings, although they had made themselves foolish. So it is on account of them that Moses says (in Deut. 32:20), “for they are a perverse generation, children with no loyalty to them.” Thus they were chosen from all of Israel at the command of the Holy One, blessed be He, and at the command of Moses, as stated (in Deut. 1:23), “Now the plan seemed good in My eyes; so I took [twelve men (<i>anashim</i>)] from you.” From here [we see] that they were righteous in front of Israel and in front of Moses. And even Moses did not want to send them until he had consulted with the Holy One, blessed be He, over each and every one. When he had said [for each one], “So-and-so from such-and-such tribe,” the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “They are acceptable.” Thus it is stated (in Numb. 13:3), “So Moses sent them from the Desert of Paran at the command of the Lord.” Then after that, at the end of forty days, they changed and made all that trouble. So they caused that generation to be afflicted with that punishment, as stated (in Deut. 32:20), “for they are a perverse generation.” Because when they were chosen, [they were] righteous, and then they changed. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 13:2, 16), “Send men for yourself […]. And these are the names of the men (anashim).”
6 Another interpretation (of Numb. 13:2) “Send men”: What is written above the matter (in Numb. 12:1)? “And Miriam spoke to Aaron about Moses.” And afterwards, (in Numb. 13:2), “Send men.” This text is related (to Is. 44:18), “They neither know nor understand; for their eyes are stuck shut so that they cannot see […].” What is the reason for saying, “Send men,” after the episode of Miriam (in Numb. 12:1ff.)? It is simply that it was anticipated by the Holy One, blessed be He, that they would come and utter evil speech against the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sot</i>. 34a.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, had said that they should not [be able to] say, “We did not know what the penalty for evil speech was.” For that reason the Holy One, blessed be He, put this [story] next to the one [in which Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, because she had spoken slander against her brother. [This was] so that everyone would know the punishment for evil speech. [It was a warning] so that if they came to speak slander, they would consider what happened to Miriam; but even so, they did not desire to learn. It is therefore stated (in Is. 44:18), “They neither know nor understand […].”
 7 Another interpretation (of Numb. 13:2), “Send men for yourself”: Even though the Holy One, blessed be He, had said to Moses, “Send men for yourself,” it was not [the wish] of the Holy One, blessed be He, for them to go.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. R. 16:7.</i> Why? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, had already told them [about] the superiority of the Land of Israel. It is so stated (in Deut. 8:7), “For the Lord your God is bringing you unto a good land.” Moreover, while they had been in Egypt, he had said to them (in Exod. 3:8), “I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians [and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and spacious land].” And Scripture states (in Exod. 13:21), “And the Lord went in front of them by day […].” So what is the point of [saying] (in Numb. 13:2), “Send men?” It is simply that they wanted these words. When they reached [Israel's] borders, Moses had said to them (in Deut. 1:21), “See, the Lord your God has set the land before you, [go and possess…].” At that time Israel approached Moses, as stated (in vs. 22), “Then you all drew near unto me [and said, ‘Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us’].” This is what Ezra<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sanh.</i> 93b, which also alludes to the book of Nehemiah under the name of Ezra.</i> said (in Neh. 9:17), “So they refused to listen and were unmindful of Your] wonders.” Now it says (in Numb. 10:33), “and the ark of the covenant of the Lord traveled ahead of them […].” And [yet] they said (in Deut. 1:22), “Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us.” [It is simply] that they did not believe. And similarly David said (in Ps. 78:10), “and they refused to follow His Torah.” R. Joshua says, “To what were they comparable? To a king who secured for his son a beautiful wife, the daughter of good and wealthy parents. The king said to him, ‘I have secured you a beautiful wife, the daughter of good and wealthy parents. There is no one like her in the whole world.’ The son said to him, ‘Let me go to see her,’ for he did not trust his father. Immediately the situation became ever more difficult for his father and it was bad for him. His father said, ‘What shall I do? If I say to him, “I am not showing her to you,” then he will say, “She is ugly. For that reason he did not want to show her.’” Finally he said to him, ‘Look at her, so that you may know that I have not deceived you. But because you did not trust me, I swear that you shall not see her in your house. Instead I am giving her to your son.’ Now similarly did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel, ‘The land is good,’ but they did not believe [Him]. They said (in Deut. 1:22), ‘Let us send men ahead of us.’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘If I prevent them, they will say, “The land is no good. For that reason He has not shown it to us.” Rather, they will only see it, for I swear that not one of them shall enter within it, but rather [only] their children.’ Thus it is stated (in Numb. 14:23), ‘Surely they shall not see the land […].’ Rather I shall give it to your children.”
8 When they said to Moses (in Deut. 1:22), “Let us send men ahead of us,” Moses began to wonder. He said, “It is impossible for me to do something before I consult with the Holy One, blessed be He.” He went and consulted. He said to him, “Your children want thus and so.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “This is not the first time for them. While they were in Egypt, they jeered at Me, as stated (in Hos. 7:16), ‘this was their derision in the land of Egypt.’ They are accustomed to such [behavior]. I do not need to test them; as see, it is written (in Dan. 2:22), ‘He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with Him’; I know what they are [saying]. But if you want, you yourself, ‘Send men for yourself.’” Where is it shown? Where it is written (in Numb. 13:16), “These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land.”
9 (Numb. 13:16, cont.) “Then Moses called Hoshea (<i>hwsh</i>') ben Nun, Joshua (<i>yhwsh</i>')”: What reason did Moses see for adding a <i>yod</i> (i.e., a <i>y</i>) to Joshua's name?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Cf. <i>Sanh</i>. 107a; Gen. R. 47:1; Exod. R. 6:1.</i> It is simply that Caleb had taken his reward from the land, as stated (in Deut. 1:36)), “to him will I gave the land on which he has trod.” But Joshua [received] the reward [that would have gone to the other] ten [spies], in that a <i>yod</i> [which stands for] ten was added to his name. (Numb. 13:16, cont.) “Then Moses called Hoshea (<i>hwsh</i>') ben Nun, Joshua (<i>yhwsh</i>'). Another interpretation: When Moses saw that they were so very wicked, Moses said to him, “May the Lord (abbreviated to yh) save (ywshy') you from this evil generation.” 
10 (Numb. 13:16) “These are the names of the men [whom Moses sent to spy out the land]”: And what were their names?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Exod. 1:1, and the notes there; Gen. R. 71:3; cf. <i>Sot</i>. 34b.</i> (Vss. 13–15,) “Sethur ben Michael. […] Nahbi ben Vophsi. […] Geuel ben Machi.” There are people whose names are handsome but whose deeds are ugly, [those whose] names are ugly but whose deeds are handsome, [those whose] names and deeds are handsome, [and those whose] names and deeds are ugly. [Those whose] names are handsome but whose deeds are ugly are Ishmael and Esau. Ishmael [means] "God hears"; Esau [means] "he does the will of his Maker.” But their deeds are ugly. [Those whose] names are ugly but whose deeds are handsome are those coming up out of exile: (According to Ezra 2:53 = Neh. 7:55,) “The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera (cf. Jud. 4-5), the children of Temah.” [Those whose] names are ugly and whose deeds are ugly are the spies. What is written about them (in Numb. 13:13)? Sethur (rt.: <i>str</i>), in that he removed (rt.: <i>str</i>) [God] from the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sot</i>. 34b.</i>
11 (Numb. 13:17) “Then he said unto them, ‘Go up here into the Negeb’”: “Go up,” since [they are] a people who go up. R. Berekhyah the Priest Berabbi said (according to vs. 22), “They found the three sons of Anak there, ‘Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Sot</i>. 34b.</i> Why was the name of [the first] called Ahiman?

Immediately they went and said (in vs. 31), “for they are stronger than we (which can also be read as, than He).” Resh Laqish said, “They compared them to the Above. Because of this transgression harsh decrees were issued against them.” What does the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Jeremiah? “Go, say to them, ‘You do not know what you have brought out from your mouth, as stated (in Jer. 11:16), “with the sound of a great tumult you have lit fire to it, and you have broken its boughs.” What did you cause to yourselves “with the sound of a great tumult” that you said, “you have lit fire to it.” “You will carry your sins one day for each year”’” (Numbers 14:34). They said (in Numb. 13:33), “And in our own eyes we were like grasshoppers.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I forgave them for that [remark]; but I was exacting [when they said] (ibid., cont.), ‘And so we were in their eyes.’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Did you know what I made you in their eyes? Who would say that you were not like angels in their eyes?” What had they brought upon themselves? (Numb. 14:34,) “According to the number of days that you explored the land […] forty years.” As though this was not enough, they did not even enter the land. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “In this world,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This form usually denotes the end of a <i>parashah</i>, but it does not do so here.</i> because the representatives (literally, those sent) were of flesh and blood, it has been decreed over them that they should not enter the land; but in the world to come I will suddenly send My angel (<i>mal'akh</i>), and he shall clear a way.” It is so stated (in Mal. 3:1), “Behold, I am sending My messenger (<i>mal'akh</i>) to clear a way before Me, and [the Lord whom you seek] shall suddenly come unto his Temple.”
12 (Numb. 13:17) “When Moses sent them […] then he said unto them, ‘Go up here into the Negeb”: Why [first] into the Negeb? Because this is what the merchants do. They show the inferior goods first, and after that they show the best. (Vs. 18) “And you are to see what the land is like”: Three times did Moses tell them, “look over the Land of Israel” (in vss. 18, 19, 20). Why? The first, he said, “See what the land is.” He said to them, “Observe the land. There is land that raises strong men, and there is [land] that raises weaklings. There is also [land] that raises armies,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Ochloi.</i></i> and there is [land] that diminishes armies.” Thus did he charge them (in Numb. 13:18), “as for the people who dwell in it, are they mighty [or] weak?” (Numb. 13:19) “And what of the land, is it good or bad […]?” And how will you know about their strength? (Numb 13:19 cont.) “Are they in camps or in strongholds”: If they dwell in camps, they are mighty and depend upon their strength; but if they are in strongholds, they are weak and have fearful hearts. (Numb. 13:20) “And what of the land, Is it fertile [or lean]”: [How do we determine] whether its fruits are light or fat. He said to them, “Look at its stones and pebbles. If they are of flint, they are fat; and if they are of clay, they are lean.” (Ibid., cont.) “Now the time was the time for the first-fruits of the grapes”: From here you learn that [the month of] Tammuz is never without figs and grapes.
13 (Numb. 13:21) “So they went up and explored the land”: How?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Sot</i>. 35a.</i> When they entered a town, a pestilence afflicted the nobility; and the people of the town were busy with their burial so when they entered, no mortal saw them. For this reason they said (in vs. 32), “The land through which we passed [… is a land that eats up its inhabitants].” It was through the [very] miracles which the Holy One, blessed be He, did for them that they spread slander. (Numb. 13:22) “And they went up to the Negeb and they came to Hevron, and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai were there,” who were extremely strong, as stated (Deut. 9:2), “whom you have known and about whom you have heard.” (Numb. 13:22) “Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt”: [This verse is] to make known the excellence of the Land [of Israel], that its worst soil is better than the land of Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> See <i>Sifre</i>, Deut. 7:12 (37); <i>Sot</i>. 34b.</i> Thus when the children of Noah took possession of the world after the flood, they first built cities, but not in the best place. Instead they chose the worst of the Land of Israel; for Hebron is the worst [place] in the Land of Israel. But Zoan is the best which is in the land of Egypt, and this [city of Hebron] preceded it by seven years. If you should say, “No, the one who built the former did not build the other”; [then I can answer,] “It was the [same] generation; it was the [same] family (according to Gen. 10:6), ‘And the sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.’” Now they arose and built the one before the other. (Numb. 13:22,) “Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.” 
14 (Numb. 13:23) “Then they came to the Wadi Eshcol”: They did not want to take any of the fruits from the Land of Israel. If Caleb had not drawn his sword, gone down in front of them, and said to them, “If you do not take [some], then either you kill me or I will kill you,” they would not have taken [anything].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Sot.</i> 34a, according to which neither Joshua nor Caleb were carrying anything.</i> It is therefore stated (to Caleb in Josh. 14:9), “Surely the land on which your foot has trod shall be a portion for you.” (Numb. 13:23) “And they bore it by pole with two”:<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The usual rendering of these words depicts the grape cluster resting on a pole suspended between two of the spies.</i> There were not less than two poles, since it does not say, "two on a pole," but “by pole with two.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., by pole, using two of them.</i> Some also say three, “By pole,” [i.e.,] one [plus] “with two” for a total of three. And how heavy a load did each and every one have in hand? Go out and learn from the stones that they took from the Jordan, as stated (in Josh. 4:20), “And Joshua set up in Gilgal those twelve stones which they took from the Jordan.” What was the size of each and every one of them? A load of forty <i>se’ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>se’ah</i> is a measure of capacity. As a weight a <i>se’ah</i> usually means a <i>se’ah</i> of wheat.</i> From here you can calculate that cluster of grapes. A person carries and lifts up [one] <i>se’ah</i> by himself. With his companion lifting [the load] up upon him, he carries two <i>se'ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi, on <i>Sot.</i> 34a, according to whom each one could carry 40 <i>se’ah</i> on his shoulder. Now since a person plus a helper can carry three <i>se’ah,</i> with two men per pole there would be 120 <i>se’ah</i> of grapes per pole.</i> Together with his companion he carries three <i>[se'ah].</i> Ergo one calculates from here (the weight of the cluster). 
15 (Numb. 13:25) “At the end of forty days then they returned from exploring the land”: But do you not find that they [only] went from south to north? Moreover, would they have walked the whole [land] in forty days? It is simply that it was revealed to the Holy One, blessed be He, that they would come and utter slander, and that there would be decreed against that generation years of suffering (according to Numb. 14:34), “[every] day a year, you shall bear your iniquities forty years.” So the Holy One, blessed be He, caused their road to shrink (i.e., to close up) before them.
16 (Numb. 13:24) “That place was called Wadi Eshcol”: This text is related (to Is. 46:10), “Declaring the end from the beginning, and from of old, things that have not yet happened,” in that everything is foreseen by the Holy One, blessed be He. Eshcol (according to Gen. 14:24) was Abraham's friend, and he was called Eshcol because of the grape cluster (<i>eshkol</i>), which Israel was going to cut from his place. 
17 (Numb. 13:26-28) “Then they went and came unto Moses and unto Aaron…. And they recounted to him and said, ‘We came unto the land …. However [the people who dwell in the land] are strong….’”: Such is the way of those who recount slander. They open with what is good and finish with what is ill. 
18 (Numb. 13:29) “Amalek dwells in the land [of the Negeb]”: What [reason] did they see for opening with Amalek? A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a child who misbehaves and is beaten with a strap. When they wanted to intimidate him, they reminded him of the strap. Similarly Amalek had been an evil strap for Israel. What [reason] did he see to post himself upon the border in the way of Israel’s entrance into the land? It is simply because his ancestor, Esau, had so commanded him in order to forestall them in their way. So he uprooted [himself] from his place and posted himself on the way, as stated (Numb. 14:45) “And there went down the Amalekite, and the Canaanite, [who dwelt in that mountain] and dealt them a shattering blow at Hormah…”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">On this reading, Amalek used to dwell in the mountains, but came down to block Israel’s passage.</i> 
19 (Numb. 13:30) “Then Caleb hushed the people [before Moses]”: As at first he said to them, “I am of the same opinion as you”; but his heart was for speaking the truth, as stated (in Josh. 14:7), “and I brought him back word according to what was in my heart. But my brothers that were with me melted the people’s heart.”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Sot</i>. 35a.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, also testifies over him, as stated (in Numb. 14:24), “But My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him.” So when the spies came, they said, “We can trust Caleb.” Immediately he stood up on a stool<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Safsal</i>; cf. Lat.: <i>subsellium.</i></i> and had all Israel become silent from clamoring against Moses, [as stated] (in Numb. 13:30), “Then Caleb hushed the people before Moses.” Now they were thinking that he would utter slander. For that reason they were silent. He began by saying (ibid., cont.), “We should certainly go up and possess it.” Immediately when they heard this, they took issue with him and said (in Numb. 13:31–32), “We are unable to go up against this people […].” 
20 (Numb. 14:1) “Then the whole congregation raised their voice [and cried]”: This text is related (to Prov. 18:8), “The words of a murmurer are like mighty blows,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">English translations usually render this unusual word as “delicacies” or something similar, but the meaning is uncertain. The present translation is derived from the context of the midrash.</i> and they go down into the chambers of the belly.” Those words which the spies murmured against the Holy One, blessed be He, brought them misfortune for generations. As if they had not listened to the spies, they would not have been punished with them. Instead they acquiesced to them, as stated (in Deut. 1:27), “You sulked (<i>teragnu</i>) in your tents.” What is the meaning of “<i>teragnu</i>?” You sought the disgrace (<i>TARtem GENUt</i>) of the Land of Israel, which the Holy One, blessed be He, called a good land. (Numb. 14:1) “Then the whole congregation raised (rt.: <i>ntn</i>) their voices; [and that night the people wept]”: This text is related (to Jer. 12:8), “[My heritage] has set (rt.: <i>ntn</i>) its voice against Me; therefore I have hated (rt.: <i>sn</i>') it.” The very voice with which you wept caused you to be punished by enemies (rt.: <i>sn</i>'). Moreover, it was over this very generation that Isaiah said (in Is. 17:11), “In the day you plant, you see it flourish; and on the morning you sow, you see it bloom.” Isaiah said, “On the day that I went to plant you in the land, you produced slag; ‘and on the morning you sow, you see it bloom,’ it has flowered before the heat [of the day].” (Is 17:11, cont.) “[But the harvest flees on a day of sickness (<i>nahalah</i>)] and human pain”: This refers to the divine punishment that you received as a legacy for [future] generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ta‘an.</i> 29a; <i>yTa‘an.</i> 4:8 (or 5) (68d); <i>Sot</i>. 35a.</i> Because the congregation wept in the night of the Ninth of Ab,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ta‘an.</i> 4:6: FIVE [CALAMITOUS] THINGS BEFELL OUR ANCESTORS ON THE SEVENTEENTH OF TAMMUZ AND FIVE ON THE NINTH OF AB…. ON THE NINTH OF AB IT WAS DECREED AGAINST OUR ANCESTORS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT ENTER THE LAND, THE TEMPLE WAS DESTROYED THE FIRST TIME AND THE SECOND TIME, BETHAR (THE CENTER OF THE BAR COCHBA REVOLT) WAS TAKEN, AND THE CITY [OF JERUSALEM] WAS PLOWED UNDER (after this revolt, but cf. <i>Ta‘an.</i> 29a).</i> the Holy One, blessed be He, has said, “You have wept for nothing in front of Me. I shall establish this night for you as [a night of] a weeping for [future] generations.” And from that hour a decree on the Temple was ordained for it to be destroyed and that the Children of Israel would go in exile among the nations. It is so stated (in Ps. 106:26-27), “So He raised His hand toward them [in an oath], to make them fall in the wilderness. And to make their seed fall among the gentiles, even to scatter them among the lands.” The raising of [the divine] hand was corresponding to the lifting up of the voice (in Numb. 14:1). 
21 (Numb. 14:2) “And all the Children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them”: These are the <i>sanhedraot</i>. (Numb. 14:2, cont.) “Would that we had died in the land of Egypt […]”: [The matter] is comparable to a king at whose tribunal<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Bema.</i></i> a certain person came up for judgment. He uttered a word from his mouth by which he convicted himself. The king set aside his bill of indictment<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>elogium</i>; Gk.: <i>elogion</i>.</i> and convicted him out of his own mouth. He said to him, “I am judging you by what has come out of your own mouth. So let it be for you according to what you have said.” Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them (in Numb. 14:29), “In this desert shall your carcasses fall.” (Numbers 14:28) “’As I live,’ says the Lord, ‘as they have spoken in My ears […]’”: They began to say (in Numb. 14:3–9), “And why is the Lord bringing us [unto this land…]?” They also said to each other, “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.” Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces [before the whole assembly of the congregation of the Children of Israel]. Moreover, Joshua ben Nun and Caleb ben Jephunneh, of those who had explored the land, rent their clothes and spoke unto the whole assembly of the Children of Israel, …. “If the Lord is pleased with us, [He will bring us into this land]…. Only do not rebel against the Lord….” The people said to them, “We have no faith in you! Our brothers care for us more than you do.” Thus it is stated (in Deut. 1:28), “Where are we going up to? Our brothers have caused [our hearts] to melt (with fear).” (Numb. 14:10) “So the whole congregation said to stone [them with stones]”: And who was “them?” Moses and Aaron. (Ibid., cont.) “Then the glory of the Lord appeared in the tent of meeting”: [This incident] teaches that they threw stones, but the cloud intercepted them. 
22 (Numb. 14:11) “Then the Lord said unto Moses, ‘How long (<i>'ad-'anah</i>) will this people scorn Me, and how long (<i>'ad-'anah</i>) will they have no faith in Me?’”: The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I have uttered two cries (of '<i>ad-'anah</i>) because of you. Your end shall be to cry out in the subjection of the four empires: (Ps. 13:2-3,) ‘How long (<i>'ad-'anah</i>), O Lord, will you forget me forever; how long (<i>'ad'-'anah</i>) will you hide Your face from me? How long (<i>'ad-'anah</i>) shall I take counsel in my soul with grief in my heart [all day]; how long (<i>'ad-'anah</i>) will my enemy be exalted over me?’ I cried out (in Numb. 14:27), ‘How long (<i>'Ad-matay</i>) shall this evil congregation [be murmuring against me]?’ Your end shall be to cry out (in Ps. 6:4), ‘My soul also is greatly dismayed; [and You, O Lord, how long (<i>'ad-matay</i>)]?’” (Numb. 14:12) “I will strike them with pestilence”: Moses said, “Master of the world, look at the covenant with their ancestors, to whom You swore that You would raise up from them kings, prophets, and priests!” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “But are you not one of their children?” (Ibid., cont.) “Then I will make you into a nation that is greater [and more numerous than they]!’” When Moses saw [how things were], he took a different course (in Numb. 14:13-14): “But Moses said unto the Lord, ‘When the Egyptians hear [what happened]…, they will say unto the inhabitants of this land.’” They will say, “He had no power to sustain them.” He said to him, “But have they not seen the miracles and the mighty deeds which I did for them in Egypt and by the sea?” They will say, “He was able to stand against us, [but] He was not able to stand against thirty one kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See Josh. 12:9-14.</i> Master of the universe, act on Your behalf. (Numb. 14:17) “So now please let the power of the Lord increase,” and let the principle of mercy overcome the principle of justice. (Ibid., cont.) “As you have promised, saying”: I said to You, “With what principle do You judge Your world,” as stated (in Exod. 33:13) “Please make Your ways known to me.” So you removed (rt.: '<i>br</i>) [the principle of justice] from me (according to Exod. 34:6), “And the Lord passed by (rt.: '<i>br</i>) [before] him, and proclaimed.” Fulfill that principle of which You told me; (according to Exod. 34:6) “The Lord, the Lord is of long patience, of great kindness…” (Numb. 14:19) “Please pardon [the sin of this people].” The Holy One, blessed be He, accepted his words and conceded to him, [as stated] (Numb. 14:20), “Then the Lord said, ‘I have pardoned like your words.’” As truly in the future, Egypt will say like your words. 
23 (Numb. 14:21, 23) “Nevertheless, as I live [It is also written (in Numb. 32:11), “Surely none of] the people who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and up, [shall see the land].” [From] twenty years – whether one was in agreement or was not in agreement (with the spies), [he did not enter the land]. Less than twenty years, if one had not gotten two [pubic] hairs – whether one was in agreement or was not in agreement (with the spies), [he did enter the land]. If one had gotten two [pubic] hairs but was less than twenty,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">On the concept that moral responsibility comes at twenty, see Rashi on Gen. 23:1.</i> [only] if he was in agreement with them, he did not enter [the land]. But nonetheless, not one of them died at less than sixty.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Holy One subsequently had compassion on all under twenty, so that they outlived the forty wilderness years to die in the land of Israel. So Enoch Zundel in his commentary, ‘<i>Ets Yosef</i>, on Numb. R. 16:23(14).</i> Come and see the difference [as it is stated] (in Mal. 3:18), “between righteous and wicked […].” It is comparable to a certain matron<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>matrona.</i></i> who had a bondmaid. Now her husband went to a country overseas. All night the bondmaid said to the matron, “I am fairer than you and the king loves me more than you.” That matron said to her, “When the morning comes, you shall know who is fairer and whom the king loves.” Similarly do the nations of the world say to Israel, “As for us, our deeds are more beautiful, and us does the Holy One, blessed be He, desire.” Therefore Isaiah has said, “When the morning comes, we shall know whom the Holy One, blessed be He, desires,” as stated (in Is. 21:12), “The watchman said, ‘The morning comes […].’” When the world to come arrives, which is called morning,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">See Targum Pss. 90:14; 101:8.</i> we shall know, as stated (according to Mal. 3:18), “Then you shall again see [the difference] between righteous and wicked.” It is written (in Ps. 62:10), “But humans are mere vanity […].” R Hiyya<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since the authority generally cited as R.

Levi, “All vanities which Israel does all the days of the year are (ibid., cont.) to go up (i.e., vanish) on the scales (<i>mozenayim</i>).” The Holy One, blessed be He, pardons them in the constellation Libra (<i>Mozenayim</i>), in the month of Tishri. It is so stated (in Lev. 16:30), “For on this day atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you.”
24 (Numb. 14:11) “Then the Lord said unto Moses, ‘How long will this people scorn Me?’”: This text is related (to Prov. 1:25, 30), “But you have spurned all My plan and would not accept My rebuke [….] they have despised all My rebuke.” What is the implication of “But you have spurned?” Simply that all the good which I planned for you, you have spoiled and spurned. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 1:25), “But you have spurned (rt.: <i>pr</i>') all My plan.” At the beginning (in Exod. 3:8), “I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians.” But you did not act [in the way I intended]. Instead you came to the sea and immediately spoiled My plan, as stated (in Ps. 106:7), “they rebelled at the sea, at the Reed Sea.” I brought down on your behalf thousands upon thousands and myriads upon myriads of angels, and I passed on two angels to each and every person in Israel: One to gird him with his weapons<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>zone</i> (“<i>girdle</i>”).</i> and one to put a crown on his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">See Lam.

Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:4), “But you who clung to the Lord your God are all alive today.” So also it says (in Exod. 32:16), ‘and the writing was the writing of God inscribed (<i>harut</i>) on the tablets.” What is the meaning of <i>harut?</i> R. Judah says, “Freedom (<i>herut</i>) from the empires”; but R. Nehemiah says, “From the angel of death”; and Rabbi says, “From afflictions.” Look at the plan which the Holy One had devised for them! Then they immediately spoiled this plan [after only] forty days. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 1:25), “But you have spurned all My plan.” The Holy One said to them, “I had said that you would not sin. Instead you would live and endure like Me, just as I live and endure forever and forevermore." (According to Ps. 82:6), “I said, ‘You are masters; even all of you are children of the Most High.’” Like the ministering angels who never die. Yet after this greatness you wanted to die (according to vs. 7), “Indeed you shall die like a human (<i>Adam</i>),” i.e. like the first Adam, to whom I decreed one commandment which he was to do, that he might live and endure forever, as stated (in Gen. 3:22), “Behold, the human (<i>Adam</i>) has become like one of Us.” Similarly also (in Gen. 1:27), “And God created the human (<i>Adam</i>) in His own image”, so that he would live and endure like Himself. Yet he corrupted his works and nullified His decree, and he ate of the tree. Then I said to him (in Gen. 3:19), “For dust you are .” So also in your case (in Ps. 82:6), “I said, ‘You are masters.’” But you corrupted yourselves as did Adam. Surely you shall die like Adam! And who made this happen to them? (According to Prov. 1:25) “But you have spurned all my plan.” The Holy One said, “With the very good that I made for you, you provoked Me. When they came to the desert, I brought the manna down to you for forty years.” Moreover, none of them had to ease nature for those forty years. Rather when they ate the manna, it simply  became flesh for them, as stated (in Ps. 78:25)  “Each one ate the bread of the mighty (rt.: '<i>br</i>)”;<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 7:4; <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael, Wayassa</i>‘ 4 (on Exod. 16:15); <i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 11:4 (88); <i>Yoma</i> 74b.</i> and they provoked Him with it." They began saying to each other, “Do you not know that we have had several days, without easing nature? And a person who does not ease nature for four or five days, dies; (according to Numb. 21:5), ‘our soul loathes this miserable (rt.: <i>QLL</i>) food.’” Because it was light (rt.: <i>QLL</i>) within their bowels. The Holy One said, “In whatever way I did well for them, in that way they provoked Me.” It is so stated (in Is. 5:4), “What else is there to do for My vineyard.” The spies went and looked at the land. Now you find that wherever Israel goes they are recognized. It is so stated (in Is. 61:9), “all who see them shall recognize them.” However (in the case of the spies), the Holy One said, “If they see them, they will recognize that they are Israelites and they will kill them. So what shall I do?” In the case of each and every province into which the spies entered, the head of a province was afflicted with plague, or its king was smitten with plague, in order that they would be occupied with bringing out their dead and not pay attention to the spies. Thus they would not kill them. Yet by this they provoked Me. When they came to Moses and to Israel, they said, “What is this land?” In every place they entered, they saw dead bodies. “And what is the benefit;  (according to Numb. 13:32) ‘it is a land that eats up its inhabitants….’” The Holy One said, “I thought that you would become like the ancestors, [of whom it is written] (in Hos. 9:10), ‘Like grapes in the desert.’ I did not think that you would become like Sodom.” Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:32), “For their vine is from the vine of Sodom.” (Is. 5:4) “When I hoped for it to produce grapes, why did it produce sour grapes?” It is therefore stated (in Numb. 14:11), “How long will this people scorn me?”
25 Moses said to Him (in vss. 14, 15), “Now they have heard that You, O Lord, are in the midst of this people. If then You slay this people like one man.” So the nations of the world would not say, “The gods of Canaan are stronger than the gods of Egypt; the gods of Egypt are false, but those of Canaan are of land watered by rain (i.e., of <i>Ba'al</i>).” (Numb. 14:14, 16) “They will say unto the inhabitants of this land […] Because he was not able (<i>yekholet</i>),” i.e., because He did not have the means to supply enough food, He brought them out to have them die in the desert. Now the word, <i>yekholet</i> can only refer to food, since it is stated (in I Kings 5:25 [11]), “and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat as food (<i>makkolet</i>) for his household.” Another interpretation: Lest the nations of the world think of You as cruel. That is to say: When the generation of the flood came, He destroyed them. And similarly, when the generation of the dispersion came, and when the Sodomites came, and when the Egyptians came, He destroyed them And also in the case of these whom He has called (in Exod. 4:22), “My first-born son,” He is destroying (<i>mekhalleh</i>) them! He is like that Lilith (<i>keLilit</i>). When she does not find anything else, she turns on children. So (in Numb. 14:16), “Because the Lord was not able.” Moses said, “Sovereign of the world, (according to vs. 14) ‘[that…] You […], o Lord, are seen face to face (literally: eye to eye).’” What is the meaning of “[that...] are seen eye to eye ('<i>YN B</i>'<i>YN</i>)?”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly Deut. R. 5:13.</i> R. [Simeon ben] Laqish said, “See, the scales are balanced (rt.: '<i>YN</i>).” “You say (in Numb. 14:12), “’I will smite them with pestilence’; but I am saying (in vs. 19), ‘Please pardon.’ We shall see whose utterance will stand.” It is so stated (in Numb. 14:20), “Then the Lord said, ‘I have pardoned them as you asked.’” But nevertheless, the decree of the Holy One which he had uttered to Moses (in Numb. 14:12), “then I will make you into a nation that is greater,” that decree was not repealed. He raised up from him sixty myriads, as stated (in I Chron. 23:17), “but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.” And in the world to come the Holy One shall gather them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 49:12), “Look! These are coming from afar. And look! These are from the north and from the sea (i.e., from the west), and these from the land of Sinim.” Moreover, the exiles shall come with them, also the tribes who are located beyond the River Sambatyon<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Sabbatikos</i> (“Sabbatical”).

R. 11:5, <i>PR</i> 23:8; according to which the river carried stones in its current during the whole week but rested on the Sabbath. See also Pliny, <i>HN</i> 31:18 (24); <i>Sanh.</i> 65b. Cf.

Let them attain joy and gladness; may sorrow and sighing flee].”
26 (Numb. 14:27) “How long […]”: A legal teaching: When a baby has a stone in his hand on the Sabbath, is it permissible to pick him up [on the Sabbath]? Thus have our masters taught (in Shab. 21:1): A person may pick up one's child, even with a stone in his hand, or a basket (of fruit) with a stone inside it. You have learned from the generation of the wilderness that the Holy One, as it were, carried them up in the wilderness, (as in Deut. 1:31) “as one carries his child,” yet there was an object of idolatry in their hand.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Corresponding to the stone in the hand of the child.</i> Thus it is stated (in Neh. 9:18), “as they had made themselves a molten calf.” And so you find that, when they crossed in the sea, Micah's image (of Jud. 17:3–4) crossed with them, as stated (in Zech. 10:11), “And a rival wife<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tsarah.</i> The Midrash understands the word in this sense, although most translations follow the other meaning of <i>tsarah,</i> i.e., “affliction,” “distress,” or the like.

Pss. 101:2; Exod. R. 41:1; also <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael, Wayassa</i>‘ 1 on Exod. 15:22; <i>ySuk.</i> 4:3 (54c); see <i>ARN</i>, A, 34.</i> Still with all this, the Holy One did not forsake them. He said to Moses, “I have done a lot of good things with them; yet they are provoking Me a lot. I parted the sea for them; they provoked Me,” as stated (in Pss. 78:40), “How often did they defy Him.” Here also they brought a bad name upon the land. I am not able to endure. How long shall I endure them? [Ergo] (in Numb. 14:27), “How long shall this evil congregation?”
27 Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27), “How long”: This text is related (to Mal. 1:11), “For from the rising of the sun [even] to where it sets, My name shall be great among the gentiles.” The Holy One said, “The nations of the world honor Me; but as for you, how many miracles have I performed for you? Still you provoke Me. Do you want to know [the facts]? Eglon, king of Moab, was uncircumcised. Then Ehud ben Gera entered where he was; and as soon as he mentioned My name to him, he showed Me honor and rose from his seat,” as stated (in Jud. 3:20), “then Ehud said, ‘I have a word from God for you’; so he arose from his seat.” This was to fulfill what was said (in Mal. 1:11), “For from the rising [of the sun to where it sets my name shall be great among the gentiles].” The Holy One said, “The nations of the world honor Me; and they show Me respect. Yet when you provoke Me, I plead with you. How long do I tolerate you?” (Numb. 14:27) “How long shall this evil congregation?” The Holy One said, “As it were, someone buys himself a servant, so that the servant may take the lantern<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>phanos.</i></i> and give light to the one who bought him; but I did not do so. Rather, though you are My servants, [as stated] (in Lev. 25:55), ‘For to Me the Children of Israel are servants,’ I have taken the lantern and given light to them.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): By universal custom one buys himself a servant so that, if he sets out on the road, his slave will go ahead and prepare for him safe and well supplied quarters;<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>etoimasia</i> (“preparation”).</i> but I have not done so. Rather, though you are My servants, I prepared quarters for you, as stated (in Numb. 10:33), “and the ark of the covenant of the Lord [traveled ahead of them three days' journey] to seek out a resting place for them.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): By universal custom one buys himself a servant so that his servant will bake bread for him, but I did not do so. Rather, though you are My servants, I baked for you bread from the heavens.” And so it says (in Ps. 78:25), “Each one ate the bread of the mighty.”
28 The Holy One said to Moses, “I am exterminating them from before Me.” Moses said to Him, “Sovereign of the Universe, in the case of a servant, if his deeds are good so that his master looks at him with a friendly face, one does not give his master any credit. So when would they give him credit? When the servant's conduct is evil, and then his master looks at him with a friendly face. So also in Your case, pay no attention to their stiff neck.” Thus it is stated (in Deut. 9:27), “pay no attention to the stubbornness of this people.” [So] the Holy One said to him. “Because of you, I am forgiving them.” It is so stated (in Numb. 14:20), “And the Lord said, ‘I have pardoned them as you asked.’” 

Chapter 17

1 (Numb. 15:2) “When you come unto the land of your habitations”: A legal teaching: How many things is a father obligated to do for a son? Thus have our masters taught: A father is obligated to do five things for a son:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>TQid.</i> 1:11; <i>yQid.</i> 1:7 (61a); <i>Qid.</i> 29a; <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael, Pisha</i>, 18 (on Exod. 13:13); Eccl. R. 9:9:1.</i> The father is the Holy One, blessed be He, and the son is Israel. The [human] father is obligated to circumcise his son. Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, circumcised Israel at the hands of Joshua (according to Josh. 5:2), “And he made for himself […].” The father is obligated to redeem [his son]. Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, did so for Israel. He redeemed them, as stated (in II Sam. 7:23), “to redeem as a people for Himself.” [The father is obligated] to teach him Torah. And the Holy One, blessed be He, also taught Torah to Israel, [as stated] (in Deut. 11:19), “And you shall teach them to your”; and it is written (in Is. 48:17), “I am the Lord your God, teaching you for your own good.” [The father is obligated] to teach him commandments. The Holy One, blessed be He, taught the commandments to Israel. [The father is obligated] to have him marry a wife. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them (in Gen. 1:28), “Be fruitful and multiply.” [Moreover,] just as a father has a responsibility to his son to feed him, to give him drink, to wash him, to anoint him and to dress him, so does the Holy One, blessed be He, do for Israel, [as stated] (in Ezek. 16:9-10), “I bathed you in water, and washed the blood off you […]. I clothed you with embroidered garments”; (in Ezek. 16:19,) “And My bread that I had given to you”; (in Numb. 21:17) “Spring up O well, answer it.” Just as a father bequeaths properties to his son, so did the Holy One, blessed be He, do for Israel, as stated (in Jer. 3:19), “and I gave you a desirable land.” And just as his son is obligated to offer his father a gift<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>doron.</i></i>; so also did ,the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel (in Numb. 15:2-3), “When you come unto the land of your habitations [….] You shall make a burnt offering to the Lord […].” 
2 R. Tanhuma bar Abba opened [his discourse] in the name of R. Hanina the brother of R. Aha bar R. Hanina [as follows]: This <i>parashah</i> concerns libations. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 15:6–7), “Or for a ram you shall make a meal offering […]. And for the oblation [you shall offer] a third of a <i>hin</i> of wine.” From here on, (in vss. 19-20), “And it shall be that, when you eat from the bread of the land, [you shall set aside an offering for the Lord]. Of the first of your dough you shall set aside a loaf (<i>hallah</i>) as an offering….” Thus <i>hallah</i> [is mentioned] last, and libations first. For this reason R. Hanina opened (with Eccl. 9:7), “Go, eat your bread with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart.” What is the meaning of (Eccl 9:7, cont.), “God has already approved your works?” “Go, eat your bread with gladness,” refers to the <i>parashah</i> of <i>hallah</i>; “and drink your wine with a joyful heart,” refers to the <i>parashah</i> of libations. What is the meaning of (Eccl 9:7, cont.), “God has already approved [your works]?” This refers to Israel entering the land, as stated (Numb. 15:2), “When you come to the land….” Another interpretation: This verse is with reference to Abraham. When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Gen. 22:2), “Please take your son,” Abraham rose early, took him promptly, led him on, and brought him up to Mount Moriah.” Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, did you tell me (in vs. 2), ‘Please take your son,’ for no reason?” He said to him, “No! Rather [it was] to make your character known in the world.” Thus it is stated (in Gen. 18:19), “For I have made him known,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This sense is required by the midrash. A more traditional translation would begin the verse: FOR I HAVE KNOWN HIM, or FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM.</i> so that he may charge [his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord].” R. Simeon ben Johay said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘By your life, I ascribe [your obedience] to you [as proof] that, if I had told you to take your own life, you would not have refrained [from doing so] for the sake of My name, and would have obeyed [the command] to be killed for the sake of My name.’” As so is it written (in Gen. 22:16), ‘and you have not withheld your son.’ See, [‘your son’] has already specified [Isaac. So] what is the meaning of ‘your only one?’ It is to imply Abraham's life. Thus the soul is called only one, where it is stated (in Ps. 22:21) ‘Deliver my life from the sword, [my only one from the power of the dog].’” Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “It is impossible for me to go from here with no sacrifice.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham, “Here is your sacrifice. [It has been] prepared for you from the six days of creation.” (According to Gen. 22:13), “Then Abraham lifted his eyes to look, and there was a ram […].” As so did our masters teach, “The ram of Abraham was created from the six days of creation on the Sabbath eve at twilight.” So at that time, Abraham took it and (according to Gen 22:13, cont.) “he offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son.” Once it said, “he offered it up as a burnt offering,” was the verse missing anything? [So] what is the meaning of “in place of his son?” [At that time] Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, “You should so see it as if the blood of Isaac is sprinkled before You.” When he took the ram and flayed it, he said to Him, “You should so see it as if Isaac is flayed in front of You on the altar.” When he took it and dried it [with salt], he said, “You should see it as if Isaac is being dried in front of You.” When he burnt it, he said to Him, “You should so see it as if the ashes of Isaac were gathered in front of You on the altar.” Another interpretation: What is the meaning of “in place of his son?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “By your life, it is your son that is sacrificed first, but it is simply that this ram is after him.” At that time Abraham said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, I am not moving from here until You swear to me that You will never test me again; for if, heaven forbid, I had not obeyed you, I should have destroyed everything I had accomplished during my lifetime.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘By your life, so it is”; and swore to him that He would never test him again. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:16), “And he said, ‘I by Myself have sworn,’ says the Lord.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “By your life, severe afflictions and other trials had been designated to come upon you, but now they shall not come.” These were the same afflictions which came upon Job.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ySot.</i> 5:8 (or 5) (20c); Gen. R. 57:4.</i> They had been designated to come upon Abraham, for the following has been joined to the <i>parashah</i> (in Gen. 22:20–21), “And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham [saying, ‘Behold Milcah, she also has borne sons to your brother Nahor,] Uz his first-born….’” And this is Job, according to what is stated (in Job 1:1), “There was a man in the land (belonging to) Uz<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">So the midrash interprets LAND OF UZ. See <i>BB 15a</i>.</i> and Job was his name.” At that time, The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham (in Eccl. 9:7), “Go, eat your bread with gladness, [… for God has already approved your works].” Another explanation (of Eccl. 9:7), “Go, eat your bread with gladness, [… for God has already approved your works]”: It is speaking of Solomon. At the time that he built the Temple and and enhanced it, he made seven days of dedication, and again made seven days of the holiday (the Feast of the Tabernacles), and they forgot to [observe] the Day of Atonement, and were in distress. R. Isaac said, “The holy spirit went out and said to him, (Eccl. 9:7), ‘Go, eat your bread with gladness, […] for God has already approved your works].’”
3 Another interpretation (of Numb. 15:2), “When you come unto the land of your habitations”: R. Zakkay of Sha'av (in Galilee) said, “Israel said, ‘Sovereign of the World, in every other place You call this the Land of Canaan, but here (in Numb. 15:2) it is “the land of your habitations.”’ The Holy One said to them, ‘By your life, I gave it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and all of [the references] are from scripture. Since the son inherits from the father, therefore (in Numb. 15:2), “When you come unto the land of your habitations.”’” And why did Canaan merit to have the land called by its name? When they heard that Israel was coming, they evacuated the place. The Holy One, said, “You evacuated the place. [Hence] the land will be called by your name, and I will give you a land as fine as your land.” And which is this? Africa. What is written above in the section on the spies (in Numb. 14:44)? “But they presumed (rt.: '<i>pl</i>) to go up.” They brought darkness (rt.: '<i>pl</i>) to its dwellers and they all remained in darkness (rt.: '<i>pl</i>). (Ibid., cont.) “But the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses did not depart from the camp”: Thus they did not go up with them. Moses said, “Thus did the Holy One say (in Deut. 1:42), ‘You shall neither go up nor fight, for I am not in your midst.’ Now you have said (in Deut. 1:28) ‘Where are we going up to? Our brothers have caused our hearts to melt (with fear)….’” What is the meaning of melt (<i>hemassu</i>)? Our masters have said, “From here one deduces how they tithed the pomegranates.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yMa‘as.</i> 1:2 (48d).</i> Thus have our masters taught (in <i>Ma'as.</i> 1:2): They tithe pomegranates, when they become soft (rt.: <i>MSS</i>).” Moses said to them, “From the beginning you have been of two minds on the matter.” (Deut 1:22) “Then you all drew near unto me”: On the positive side (in Deut. 5:20), “and all of the heads of your tribes approached me.” But on the negative side (in Deut. 1:22), “Then you all drew near unto me and said, [‘Let us send men ahead of us to explore the land for us’]”; and it is written (in vs. 27), “And you murmured in your tents and said, ‘It is because the Lord hated us.” The Holy One says to them (in Mal. 1:2), “I have loved you!” But they say, (in Deut. 1:27), “It is because the Lord hated us.” They interpreted the verse and said, “You yourself know that He hates us. Take the case of a king of flesh and blood who has two sons. Now he also has two fields, one with irrigation and one watered by rain. Is it not that the field with irrigation will be given to whichever one the king loves, while the one watered by rain will be given to that one whom he hates? The land of Egypt has irrigation, and we were in its midst, while the land of Canaan has rain. So He brought us out from Egypt to give us the land of Canaan. Nevertheless (according to Deut. 1:41–42), “and each of you girded on his weapons of war, and you ventured to go up into the hill country. But the Lord said unto me, ‘Say to them, “Do not go up and do not fight.”’” I had intended to go up with you; but now, “Do not go up.” For you it will be a downfall. Nevertheless (according to vs. 41), “[each of] you girded,” and you all had become a single unit. (Ibid., cont.) “And you ventured to go up into the hill country”: What is the meaning of “and you ventured (rt.: <i>hyn</i>)?” That they were saying, “Drop by drop, the <i>hin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A liquid measure equal to about a gallon and a half.</i> will be filled.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they had accumulated almost enough sin to overflow their allotted measure.</i> One text (Deut. 1:43) says, “and you acted presumptuously”; while another text (Deut. 1:41) says, “and you ventured (rt.: <i>HYN</i>).” What is the meaning of “and you acted presumptuously?” That they acted presumptuously against the encampments (<i>hanayot</i>, rt.: <i>HNH</i>) of the Holy One.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> I.e., they ignored the fact that the ark of the covenant had not departed out of the camp (Numb. 14:44).</i>  (Deut. 1:43-44) “To go up into the hill country. Then the Amorites [that dwelt in that hill country came out to meet you, and they pursued you as do the bees]”: What is the meaning of “bees?” Just as the bee immediately dies when it strikes someone, so also it was with you. When one of them touched you, his soul immediately departed. Just as the bee flies, so did they fly about you. In the past, when they merely heard a report of you, they died. It is so stated (in Exod. 15:14), “When the peoples hear, they tremble.” Now (in Deut. 1:44) “and they pursued you […] and crushed you.” (Deut. 1:45) “So you returned to weep before the Lord, but the Lord would not heed”: You, as it were, made strict justice as though it were brutal. (Deut. 10:11) “And the Lord said [unto me], ‘Arise, continue the journey’”: Now if I had come to execute justice with them, they would not be entering the land. Instead, “Arise, continue the journey.” Ergo (in numb. 15:2), “When you come unto the land.” 
4 (Numb. 15:3) “And you shall make an offering to the Lord, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice”: The Holy One said to them, “Whoever offers Me a sacrifice in this world, does not offer it in vain.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Sifra</i> to Lev. 9:24 (99: <i>Parashat Shemini Mekhilta deMiluim</i>); Lam. R. 5:1 (1); Lev. R. 7:96; also Deut. R. 4:11.</i> Rather [if] he offers it, it is pleasing to Me. Also in the world to come, he shall have the right to make an offering. Then I will accept it, and it shall be pleasing to Me.” It is so stated (in Mal. 3:4), “Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasing to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in the former years.”
5 (Numb. 15:38) “Make tassels for themselves”: This text is related (to Ps. 97:11), “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for those with an upright heart.” It also says (in Is. 42:21), “The Lord [desired] because of His righteousness [to magnify and glorify the Torah].” The Holy One, blessed be He, sowed the Torah and the commandments for Israel, in order to bequeath them life in the world to come. He did not put a thing in the world concerning which He did not give Israel a commandment. Did [an Israelite] go out to plow? [There is] (Deut. 22:10), “You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.” To sow? [There is] (Deut. 22:9), “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed.” To reap? [There is] (Deut. 24:19), “When you reap your harvest in your field [and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not return to take it.]” Did [an Israelite] knead? [There is] (Numb. 15:20), “Of the first of your dough you shall set aside a loaf (<i>hallah</i>) as an offering.” Did [an Israelite] butcher? [There is] (Deut. 18:3), “that one shall give the priest the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the stomach.” With respect to a bird's nest, [there is] (Deut. 22:7), “You shall surely send away.” Concerning animals and fowl, [there is] (Lev. 17:13), “he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.” Did he plant? [There is] (Lev. 19:23), “you shall regard [its fruit] as forbidden.” Did he bury the dead? [There is] (Deut. 14:1), “you shall not cut yourselves.” Did one shave hair? [There is] (Lev. 19:27), “You shall not round off the sideburns on your head.” Did he build a house? [There is] (Deut. 22:8), “you shall make a parapet [for your roof]”; (Deut. 6:9,) “And you shall write them upon the doorposts (<i>mezuzot</i>).” Did he cover himself in a cloak (<i>tallit</i>)? [There is] (Numb. 15:38), “make tassels for themselves.” (Numb. 15:38) “They make [tassels] for themselves”: Make them, and not that they shall be from [something already] made. Thus one must not extract threads<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nimin</i>, sing.: <i>nima.</i> Cf. Gk.: <i>nema.</i></i> from the cloak [itself] and make [tassels] from them. Rather [it is] a command to get [fresh] white and blue threads to make them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Men</i>. 41b.</i> When [did this rule apply]? When there was [a real] blue, but now we only have white, because the blue has been hidden. (Ibid., cont.) “On the corners of [their garments]”: Not in the middle, but on the corner. (Ibid., cont.) “A twisted thread (<i>petil</i>)”: And he must twist (<i>petol</i>) them. R. Meir said, “Why does blue differ from all [other] kinds of colors? Because blue resembles the firmament; and the firmament resembles the throne of glory. And from seeing it, he will remember his Creator” Thus it is stated (in Exod. 24:10), “And they saw the God of Israel, [and under His feet there was something like brickwork of sapphire, like the heavens themselves for brightness].” (Numb. 15:39) “So it shall be a tassel for you”: Thus it should be visible. And what is its size? Bet Shammai says, “Four fingers,” while Bet Hillel says “Three.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Men</i>. 41b.</i> And how many strings [should they have]? Bet Shammai says “Four,” while Bet Hillel says “Three.” (Ibid.) “That you may see it”: [This is to] exclude a garment [typically worn] at night.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 15:39 (115); <i>Men</i>. 43a.</i> Are you saying, it is to exclude a garment [worn] at night? Or is actually to exclude a blind person? Hence, it says again (in vs. 40), “So that you may remember.” Hence it ordains seeing and it ordains remembering: remembering for the one who does not see and seeing for the one who does see. (Vs. 39) “That you may see it”: It (here) is masculine and not feminine.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Even though the antecedent, tassel, is feminine in Hebrew.</i> As if you have done this, it is as if you see the throne of glory, since it is similar to the blue.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. also <i>Sifre</i> to Numb. 15:39 (115), where the argument is that the pronoun is IT (in the singular) and not THEM (in the plural) with reference to tassels.</i> (Vss. 39-40) “That you may see […]. So that you may remember”: The seeing leads to remembering [the commandments], and remembering leads to performing [them]. Thus it is stated (in vs. 40), “So that you may remember and perform all My commandments.” Why? (Deut. 32:47), “Because it is not a trifling thing for you.” To what is this comparable? To a homeowner who was evaluating his taxes, and writing settlements. His father said to him, “My son, be careful with the settlements, as your life is dependent upon them.” So did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel (in Deuteronomy 32:47), “Because it is not a trifling thing for you.” 
6 (Numb. 15:39) "So that you do not follow your heart”: The heart and the eyes are procurers for the body, in that they prostitute the body. (Vs. 40) “So that you may remember and perform all my commandments”: [The situation] is comparable to a certain person who was thrown into the midst of the water. The helmsman<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>kybernetes.</i></i> extended a rope to him. He said to him, “Grab this rope with your hand, and do not let go of it; for if you do let go of it, you will lose your life.” So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel, “As long as you adhere to the commandments, [the following holds true] (in Deut. 4:4), ‘But you who cling to the Lord your God are all alive today.’” And so it says (in Prov. 4:13), “Hold onto discipline, do not slack off; keep it, for it is your life.” (Numb. 15:40, cont.) “And that you may be holy”: When you perform the commandments, you are made holy, and fear of you [comes] over the nations. [But if] you withdraw from the commandments and do sins, you immediately become profaned. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “In this world because of the evil drive, you withdraw from the commandments; [but] in the future to come I am rooting it out of you.” Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 36:27), “And I will put My spirit within you; [then I will make you walk in My statutes; and you will observe My ordinances [by performing them].”


Chapter 18

1 (Numb. 16:1) “Now Korah betook himself”: This text is related (to Prov. 18:19), “A brother offended (rt.: <i>psh</i>') is more formidable than a fortified city.” The brother offended is Korah, in that he sided against Moses. So he rebelled and sank from whatever glory that he possessed. Now offended (rt: <i>psh</i>') can only imply rebellion, since it is stated (in II Kings 3:7), “The king of Moab has rebelled (<i>psh</i>') against me.” It also says (in II Kings 8:22), “then did Libnah rebel (rt.: <i>psh</i>').” (Prov. 18:19) “[Such] contentions are like a castle bar”: The earth raised its bars against him like a castle. (Prov. 18:19:) “Like a castle bar.” [These words also refer to Korah,] who sided against Moses and against the Omnipresent.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See the commentary of Enoch Zundel on <i>Tanh</i>., Numb.5:1. This explanation is also given by Issachar Berman Ashkenazi in his commentary, <i>Mattenot Kehunnah,</i> on Numb. R. 18:1.</i> 
2 (Numb. 16:1) “[Now Korah …] took”:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In this and some of the following sections, the midrash is explaining the fact that the transitive verb, TOOK, has no object. Biblical translations offer solutions such as translating the verb intransitively, e.g., BETOOK HIMSELF, or by supplying an object, e.g., TOOK MEN.</i> “Took” can only be a word for "attracting with persuasive words," in that he attracted all the leaders of Israel and the <i>sanhedraot</i> [to follow] after him. Concerning Moses it is written (in Numb. 1:17), “So Moses and Aaron took these men.” And similarly it is written (in Numb. 8:2), “Take Aaron and his sons with him.” And so does it say (in Hos. 14:3), “Take words with you.” And so does it [also] say (in Genesis 12:15), “and the woman was taken to the house of Pharaoh.” Ergo (in Numb. 16:1) “Now Korah […] took,” in that he drew (i.e., took) their hearts with persuasive words. (Numb. 16:1) “Now Korah […] betook himself”: Because of what did he dissent? Because of Elizaphan, the son of his father's brother, who had been appointed prince (<i>nasi</i>) over his clan. So it says (in Numb. 3:30), “And the prince of the ancestral house for the Kohathite clan was Elizaphan ben Uzziel.” Korah said, “Father had four brothers.” It is so stated (according to Exod. 6:18), “And the sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.” “As for Amram, the first-born; his son Aaron attained greatness, and his brother Moses [attained] the kingship. So who deserves to get second [place]? Should it not be the second [son]? Now I am Izhar's son. I deserved to be prince of my clan, but he has appointed the son of Uzziel. Should the youngest of father's brothers become superior to me? See, I am dissenting and declaring everything invalid, whatever he had done.” Therefore, (in Numb. 16:1) “Now Korah […] took.”
3 (Numb. 16:1) “Now Korah […] took”: What is written above the matter (in Numb. 15:38)? “Speak unto the Children of Israel and tell them to make tassels (<i>zizit</i>) for themselves.’” Korah quickly said to Moses, “In the case of a prayer shawl (<i>tallit</i>) which is all blue, what is the rule about it being exempt from [having] the tassel?” Moses said to him, “[Such a prayer shawl] is required to have the tassels.” Korah said to him, “Would not a prayer shawl which is all blue exempt itself, when four [blue] threads exempt it? In the case of a house which is full of [scriptural] books, what is the rule about it being exempt it from [having] the mezuzah (which contains only two passages of scripture)?” [Moses] said to him, “[Such a house] is required to have the mezuzah.” [Korah] said to him, “Since the whole Torah has two hundred and seventy-five <i>parashiot</i> in it<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yShab.</i> 16:1 (15c); <i>Soferim</i> 16:10; M. Pss. 22:19, according to which there are 175 <i>parashiot</i> in the Torah where an expression of speaking, saying, or commanding occurs. See also <i>Alfa Beta deRabbi ‘Aqiva,</i> longer recension, <i>Tsade</i> (<i>Eisenstein, p. 421</i>).</i> and they do not exempt the house [from having the mezuzah], would the one <i>parasha</i> which is in the mezuzah exempt the house?” [He also] said to him, “These are things about which you have not been commanded. Rather you are inventing them [by taking them] out of your own heart.” Here is what is written (in Numb. 16:1), “Now Korah […] took.” (Numb. 16:1) “Now Korah […] took”: Now “took (rt.: lqh)” can only be a word of discord, in that his heart carried him away (rt.: <i>lqh</i>). Thus is [the word] used (in Job 15:12), “How your heart has carried you away (rt.: <i>lqh</i>) […].” This explains what Moses said to them (in Numb. 16:9), “Is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated [you from the congregation to draw you near unto Himself, to perform the service of the Lord's tabernacle …]?” The sages have said, “Korah was a great sage and was one of the bearers of the ark, as stated (in Numb. 7:9), ‘But to the children of Kohath He gave no [wagons], because they had the service of the holy objects, which they carried on their shoulders.’” Now Korah was the son of Izhar, [who was] the son of Kohath. When Moses said (in Numb. 15:38), “And put on the tassel of each corner a thread of blue,” what did Korah do? He immediately ordered them to make two hundred and fifty blue shawls for those two hundred and fifty heads of <i>sanhedraot</i> who rose up against Moses to wrap themselves in, just as it is stated (in Numb. 16:2), “And they rose up against Moses, together with two hundred and fifty men from the children of Israel, princes of the congregation, chosen in the assembly.” Korah arose and made them a banquet at which they all wrapped themselves in blue prayer shawls. [When] Aaron's sons came to receive their dues, [namely the] breast and right thigh,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the priestly share of the animals slaughtered for the feast. See Lev.7:31-32.</i> they arose against them and said to them, “Who commanded you to receive such? Was it not Moses? [If so,] we shall not give you anything, as the Holy One, blessed be He, has not commanded it.” They came and informed Moses. He went to placate<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Rt</i>.: PYS. See the Gk.: <i>peithein, peisai</i> in the aroist.</i> them. They immediately confronted him, as stated (ibid.), “And they rose up against Moses.” And who were they? Elizur ben Shedeur and his companions (the princes), the men (according to Numb. 1:17) “who were mentioned by name.” Although the text has not publicized<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>PRSM</i>. Cf. Gk: <i>parresiazesthai.</i></i> their [names], it has given clues<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeia.</i></i> to their [identity], so that you [can] identify them from the [various] verses. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a scion of good parentage who stole articles from the bathhouse. The owner of what was stolen did not want to publish his [name. Rather,] he began to give clues about his [identity]. When they said to him, “Who stole your articles,” he said, “A scion of good parentage, a tall person with beautiful teeth and black hair.” After he had given his clues, they knew who he was. So also here where the text has concealed them and not specified their names, it comes and gives clues to their [identity]. You know who they are. It is stated elsewhere (in Numb. 1:16-17), “These were elected by the congregation, princes of their ancestral tribes, heads of thousands within Israel. So Moses and Aaron took these men who were mentioned by name.” Now here it is written (in Numb. 16:2-3), “princes of the congregation, elected by the assembly, men of renown. They gathered together against Moses and Aaron.”
4 (Numb. 16:1) “Now Korah […] took”: [What] he took [was] his prayer shawl and he went to get counsel from his wife. When the Holy One, blessed be He, said (in Numb. 8:6-7), “Take the Levites from among the Children of Israel and purify them. Now this is what you shall do for them to purify them […] and have them pass a razor over all of their flesh.” [Moses] immediately did so to Korah. [Korah] began to go around all Israel, but they did not recognize him. They said to him, “Who did this to you?” He told them, “Moses. And not only that, but taking me by my hands and by my feet, they waved me and said to me, ‘See, you are purified.’ Moreover, he brought his brother Aaron, adorned him like a bride, and had him sit in the tent of meeting.” The enemies of Moses immediately began to incite Israel against him. So they said, “Moses is king, his brother Aaron is high priest, and his children are deputy high priests! The priest has a priestly offering (<i>terumah</i>) from the tithe<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ter.</i> 4:1.</i>; the priest has twenty-four priestly gifts!”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>THal</i>. 2:7-10 for a listing.</i> Immediately (in Numb. 16:3) “They gathered together against Moses and against Aaron, and they said unto them, [‘You have gone too far (<i>rb</i>)’.]” R. Levi said, “At that very time Korah gathered his company and said to them (i.e., to Moses and Aaron), ‘You have increased (rt.: <i>rbh</i>) the burden upon us to be more than the slavery of Egypt. We were better off under the Egyptians than under your authority. Now they wished to stone him. [Therefore] (according to vs. 4), “When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.” Moses said to them, “I do not desire kingship, nor does Aaron [desire] high priesthood. Thus it is stated (in vs. 11), “and as for Aaron, what is he that you should murmur against him?” Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, did you not command me thus (in Exod. 28:1), ‘And you shall bring near unto yourself Aaron [… to serve Me as priests]?’ Now they have arisen against us to kill us.” [So Moses] said to them (in Numb. 16:5), “In the morning the Lord will make known those who belong to Him….” What does this mean? R. Nathan said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘If all the magicians of the world gathered together and tried to turn the morning into the evening and the evening into morning, they would be unable [to do so]; but just as I [formerly] separated the light and the darkness (in Gen. 1:4), so have I separated out Aaron to sanctify him in the holy of holies.’” Immediately (in Numb. 16:12), “Then Moses sent to summon Dathan and Abiram…, but they said, ‘We will not come up.’” "We will not go" or "We will not come" is not written here, but “We will not come up.” (Prov. 18:17) “A fool's mouth is his ruin”: They opened their mouth for a calamity, by saying that they would die by going down and not going up. Just as they spoke, so did they die (according to Numb. 16:33), “So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol.” Moses said, “In as much as they did not want to come [to me], I shall go to them. Perhaps they will be ashamed and repent.” It is so stated (in Numb. 16:25), “Then Moses arose and went unto Dathan and Abiram.” When they saw him they began to curse and blaspheme, as stated (in vs. 27), “and Dathan and Abiram came out standing (rt.: <i>ntsb</i>).” Does one go out sitting, kneeling, or lying prostrate?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that to mention that Dathan and Abiram were standing seems unnecessary and therefore implies some deeper meaning.</i> It is simply [that it is to teach] that they went out cursing and blaspheming. As going out and standing upright (rt.: <i>ytsb</i>) is mentioned here, and going out and standing upright (rt.: <i>ntsb</i>) is [also] mentioned in reference to Goliath the Philistine, where it is written (in I Sam. 17:4, 16), “And there went out a champion [….] Then the Philistine drew near at dawn and in the evening, and he took his stand (rt.: <i>ytsb</i>) for forty days.” Just as going out and standing upright (rt.: <i>ntsb</i>) involved cursing and blaspheming in that case,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The cursing and blaspheming is specifically mentioned in I Sam.17:8-10.</i> so also in this case did going out and standing upright (rt.: <i>ntsb</i>) involve cursing and blaspheming. Moses therefore began by saying (in Numb. 16:29, 32), “If these [people] die….” [And it is also written] (in Numb. 16:32), “And the earth opened its mouth [and swallowed them].” Come and see how [harmful] dissension is! As anyone who [even] aids dissension, the Holy One, blessed be He, eradicates his memory. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:35), “And a fire went forth from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men [coffering the incense].” R. Berekhyah said, “How harmful is dissension! An emissary of the court on high only imposes a penalty<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>QNS</i>; cf. Lat.: <i>censere</i>, which can mean “to tax.”</i> [on people] from the age of twenty years, while the court below [only imposes a penalty] from the age of thirteen years. In the case of Korah's dissension, however, one-day-old babies were burned and swallowed up in nethermost Sheol. Thus it is written (in Numb. 16:27, 33), ‘[and Dathan and Abiram came out standing at the entrance of their tents] with their wives, their children, and their little ones. So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol.’” It is therefore stated (Numb. 16:1), “Now Korah […] took.”
5 (Numb. 16:1) “[Korah who is] the son of Izhar [who is] the son of Kohath [who is] the son of Levi betook himself”: But why is it not written "the son of Jacob" [or] "the son of Israel?"<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> Cf.Gen. R. 98:5.</i> This text is related (to Gen. 49:6), “Let not my soul come into their council,” i.e., that of the spies; “and let not my glory be joined with their congregation,” i.e., that of Korah. Jacob said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, with reference to the spies and with reference to the dissension of Korah, let not my name be mentioned [in connection with] those evil men, who are going to cause provocation. So when should my name (Israel) be joined upon them? When they are joined together to stand on the dais (as Levitical singers), as stated (I Chron. 6:[17,] 22–23) ‘[These are the ones whom David put in charge of song in the house of the Lord….] The son of Assir [who is] the son of Ebiasaph [who is] the son of Korah [who is] the son of Izhar [who is] the son of Kohath [who is] the son of Levi [who is] the son of Israel.’” (Numb. 16:1, cont.) “Along with Dathan and Abiram”: From here the sages said, “Woe to the wicked one, [and] woe to his neighbor.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Neg.</i> 12:6; <i>Sifra</i> to Lev.14:40 (157: <i>Metsora</i>‘, pereq 4); <i>ARN</i>, A, 9; cf. <i>ARN</i>, B, 16; Numb.R. 3:12; <i>Suk.</i> 56b; above, Numb.1:13.</i> Dathan and Abiram [were destroyed by the dissent of Korah], because they were neighbors of Korah. As he was dwelling to the south (of the tabernacle), as stated (in Numb. 3:29), “The families of the Children of Kohath were to camp along the side of the tabernacle to the south.” The standard of Reuben was near them, as stated (in Numb. 2:10), “The standard of the camp of Reuben shall be to the south.” However, the standard of Judah was in the east, and with him were Issachar and Zebulun, as stated (in Numb. 2:3), “Now these camping in front to the east shall be the standard of the camp of Judah.” And near them were Moses and Aaron, as written (in Numb. 3:38), “Those who camped before the tabernacle, in front before the tent of meeting to the east, were Moses, Aaron, and his children.” Because these were near the Torah, they were therefore worthy to be Torah scholars, as written (in Ps. 60:9), “Judah is my lawgiver.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mehoqeq.</i> Most translations render the word as scepter, since kingship was what Judah actually attained.</i> And it is [also] written (in I Chron. 12:33), “And from the Children of Issachar, those who had an understanding of the times.” And it is [also] written (in Jud. 5:14), “and from Zebulon those who wield the scribal pen.” But Dathan and Abiram, who were neighbors to Korah – the one responsible for the dissent – were struck with him and perished from the world. 
6 (Numb. 16:19) “And Korah gathered [the whole community] against them”: He said to them (in Numb. 16:3), “’You have gone too far, for all the congregation are holy, every one of them.’ Moreover, every one of them heard on Sinai (in Exod. 20:2 = Deut. 5:6), ‘I am the Lord your God.’ (Numb. 16:3, cont.,) ‘So why do you elevate yourselves?’” If only you had heard, and they did not hear, you could have said [that you are more worthy]. But now they all heard, “so why do you elevate [yourselves]?” Immediately Moses trembled, because it was already the fourth transgression on their hands. It is comparable to a king's son who had transgressed against his father. Now his friend effected a reconciliation with him once,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>PSY</i>. See the Gk.: <i>peithein, peisai</i> in the aorist.</i> twice, and three times. When he transgressed a fourth time, the king's friend became discouraged. He said, “How many times shall I bother the king?” So also [it was with] Moses towards Israel. They had sinned with the calf, and (according to Exod. 32:11,) “Moses implored.” In the case of the murmurers, (according to Numb. 11:2,) “Moses prayed.” In the case of the spies, (according to Numb. 14:13,) “Moses said unto the Lord, when the Egyptians hear [what happened].” [So] in the case of Korah's dissension, he said, “How often can I bother the Omnipresent?” Therefore (in Numb. 16:4), “When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.”
7 (Numb. 16:5) “In the morning [the Lord will make known those who belong to him]”: What reason did he have for saying, “In the morning He will make known?” Moses said, “Perhaps they said this thing because they had been excessively eating and drinking.” He therefore said, “In the morning.” Perhaps between now and then they will repent. He said to them, “I have no authority to enter [the tabernacle] now. Even though there is no eating and no drinking, it is simply because of us [that we are forbidden to enter] as we have taken food and drink.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 16:5): Moses said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, has distinguished boundaries in His world. Can you confuse morning with evening? And that is what is written in the beginning (in Gen. 1:5), ‘There was evening and there was morning.’ And (in vs. 4) ‘God separated the light and the darkness,’ for its use in the world. And just as he made a separation between the light and the darkness, so did he separate Israel from the nations, [as stated] (in Lev. 20:26), ‘I have separated you from the [other] peoples to be Mine.’ So also did he separate Aaron, as stated (in I Chron. 23:13), ‘Aaron was separated to consecrate the most holy things.’ If you can confuse this distinction in which he made a separation between the day and the night, you may be able to nullify this.” For this reason he said to them (in Numb. 16:5), “In the morning the Lord will make known those who belong to Him.” Such a one is already designated; (according to ibid., end) “the one whom He will choose He will have draw near unto Him.”
8 (Numb. 16:6) “Do this; take censers, [Korah and all his company…]”: What was his reason for saying this to them? He said to them, “In the religions of the nations there are many laws,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>NYMWSYN.</i> Gk.: <i>nomoi.</i></i> and many priests, and they all assemble at one time. Now as for us, we only have one God, one Torah, one justice, one altar, and one high priest; but you two hundred and fifty men are [yet all] seeking high priesthood! I also am willing in this regard.” (Numb. 16:11,) “Therefore you and all your company.” (Numb. 16:6) “Do this, take censers, Korah and all his company”: Here you have a ministry more precious than all the others. It is the incense, the most precious of the sacrifices. But a deadly poison had been put within it, through which Nadab and Abihu were burned. He therefore warned them (in vs. 7, cont.), “then it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord chooses is the holy one,” Moses said to them, “See, I am telling you that you are not to incur guilt, [only] the one to be chosen from among you shall come out alive, and all [the rest] of you shall perish.” (Numb. 16:7,) “You Levites have gone too far”: See, I have told you a great thing! Were they not fools, in that when he gave them this warning, they took it upon themselves to offer sacrifice? They had sinned against their own lives, as stated (in Numb. 17:3), “The censers of these who have sinned at the cost of their lives.” Now since Korah was a clever man, how did he see fit to commit this folly? It is simply that his eyes misled him. He foresaw a great lineage stemming from himself, [e.g.,] Samuel, who was the equivalent of Moses and Aaron, as stated (in Ps. 99:6), “Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call His name.” Moreover, the twenty-four [Levitical] shifts would stem from his descendants, all of whom would prophesy by the holy spirit, as stated (in I Chron. 25:5), “All these were sons of Heman.”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A descendant of Korah.</i> He said, “Is it possible that, when this greatness is going to stem from me, I should perish?” But he did not foresee correctly, since his children would repent, and those [great ones] would stem from them. But Moses did foresee well. [Korah] therefore participated on this assumption, when he heard from the mouth of Moses that they all would perish, but one would escape, as stated (Numb. 16:7) “then it shall come to pass that the man whom the Lord chooses is the holy one.”
9 (Numb. 16:8) “So Moses said unto Korah, [‘Please listen, you Children of Levi]”: Do you have someone speaking with Joseph, who tells Simon to listen?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is concerned with the fact that Moses addresses the Children of Levi when speaking only to Korah.</i> Some say that he wished him to reconsider. So he said gentle words to him. When he saw that he did not listen to him, he said (to himself), “Before others join with him, they should reconsider.” He began to urge them (in Numb. 16:8), “’Please listen, you Children of Levi,’ is the honor that you have too little.” [It is so stated] (in vs. 9) “Is it too small a thing for you […]?” He turned again to Korah (in vs. 10), “That he has had you approach Him and all your brother Levites along with you?” [It was] because he was the head person in the tribe, that his brothers had become an extension of himself. (Numb. 16:11,) “Therefore you and all your company have come together against the Lord.” This dissension which you are creating is not against us, but rather against the Holy One, blessed be He. It is comparable to a king who had a lot of slaves. He wanted to make one of them a freedman and give him a dominion.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">In imperial Rome the emperor’s freedmen were habitually given positions of power.</i> He reconsidered and [even] made him [one of the] senators.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sinqelitin</i>: Gk.: <i>syngkletoi.</i></i> His companions rose up against him. If he had made himself a freedman and taken this dignity for himself, it would have been well for them to rise up against him. Now that his master has acted for him, when anyone rises against him, is not such a one rising up against his master? So also did Moses say to them, “If my brother Aaron had taken the priesthood for himself, it would have been well for you to murmur against him. [But since] the one who gave it to him was the Holy One, blessed be He, to whom belong royalty, high office and power, whenever someone rises against my brother Aaron, is he not taking sides against the Holy One, blessed be He?” It is therefore written (in Numb. 16:11), “and as for Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?” Come and see the piety of Aaron the righteous! When Moses stood Aaron up and poured the anointing oil upon his head, Aaron trembled with fear. He said to him, “Moses my brother, perhaps I was not worthy to be anointed with the anointing oil; for I may have acted fraudulently and become liable to excision, since it is stated (in Exod. 30:32), ‘Upon human flesh it shall not be poured.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 3:6; M. Pss. 133:1.</i> Therefore, scripture testified about him (in Ps. 133:1-3), “See how good and pleasant it is […]! It is like the precious oil upon the head running down onto the beard, the beard of Aaron […]; Like the dew of Hermon….” [Scripture] has compared the anointing oil with the dew of Hermon. As the dew of Hermon has no [rules concerning] fraudulent use, neither does the anointing oil that was on the head of Aaron have [rules concerning] fraudulent use. It is therefore [written] (in Numb. 16:1), “[Therefore you and all your company] have come together against the Lord.” With all these words Moses [tried to] appease Korah, but you do not find that he gave him any answer. Because he was clever in his wickedness, he said [to himself], “If I answer him, I know that, since he has great wisdom, he will now overwhelm me with his words and seduce me into being reconciled with him against my will. It is [hence] better that I not respond to him.” When Moses saw that there was nothing to be gained with him, he withdrew from him. 
10 (Numb. 16:12) Then Moses sent to summon Dathan and Abiram: They also persisted in their wickedness and did not care to answer him (ibid., cont.), “and they said, ‘We will not come up.’” Their [very] mouths tripped up [these] wicked men, for a covenant is made with the lips. So they died and went down to the nethermost Sheol, after they had gone down alive to Sheol. (Numb. 16:13) “Is it so small a matter that you have brought us up [from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert], that you must also lord it over us”: They said to him, “On what basis do you assume superiority over us? What good have you done with us? You brought us out of the land of Egypt, which was (according to Gen. 13:10) ‘like the garden of the Lord’; but you have not brought us into the land of Canaan. Rather here we are in the desert, where the plague is sent among us; (according to Numb. 16:14) ‘would you put out the eyes of these people….’” (Numb. 16:15) “Now Moses was very angry”: He was very anguished. Why? When a man argues with his companion and reasons with him; when he answers him, he has peace of mind; but if he does not answer him, then this involves anguish. (Numb. 16:15, cont.) “And he said unto the Lord, ‘Pay no attention unto their meal offering’”: Do not accept them in repentance. Scripture should have said, “Pay no attention unto their service"? What is the meaning of “their meal offering?” This is what Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, I know that these have a share in that meal offering that [Israel offers every day], as stated (Numb. 29:19), ‘in addition to the daily burnt offering, and its meal offering.’ And it is offered from all of Israel. [But] in as much as these have withdrawn from Your children, do not pay attention to their portion. Let the fire leave it alone and not consume it.” (Numb. 16:15, cont.) “I have not taken one donkey from them”: That which I had [a right] to take I did not take. By universal custom, one who works in the sanctuary receives wages from the sanctuary. [In my case, however,] when I went down from Midian to Egypt I had a right to take a donkey from them, since it was on behalf of their needs that I was going down [there]; but I did not take [one]. Similarly also did Samuel the righteous say (in I Sam. 12:3), “Here am I, testify against me before the Lord and before His anointed; whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken?” When I sacrificed an ox for their offerings to seek mercy for them and likewise for anointing a king over them, it belonged to me, as stated (in I Sam. 16:2), “Take a heifer with you […].” And similarly it says (in I Sam. 9:12), “because the people have a sacrifice today at the high place (<i>bamah</i>).” But I took nothing from what belonged to them. Also when I sought to handle their lawsuits and their [other] needs, and when I made the circuit of the cities, as stated (in I Sam. 7:16), “And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, [Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all those places];” [although] by universal custom litigants go to the judge, I went around from city to city and from place to place and the donkey was mine. Now even Moses said to Israel (in Exod. 18:16), “When they have a matter, it comes unto me.” But I (Samuel) did not act in this way. Instead I took the trouble to go to them. (Numb. 16:15, cont.) “And I have not harmed a single one of them,” in that I neither convicted the innocent nor acquitted the guilty. When Moses saw that they continued in their pride, then he said to them (according to Numb. 16:17,) “‘[Tomorrow] you and all your company [are to be present before the Lord].” Then Korah went about all that night and led Israel astray. Now he would say to them, “What do you suppose? That I am busy obtaining greatness for myself? I wish for greatness to go the rounds to all of us, while Moses has taken kingship for himself and has given the high priesthood to his brother Aaron.” So did he go about seducing each and every tribe as it suited them, until they joined him. It is so stated (Numb. 16:19), “And Korah gathered all the congregation against them.” When they all entered, they were speaking with him; immediately (we read in Numb. 16:20–22), “Then the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, ‘Separate yourselves from the midst of this evil congregation, [so that I may consume them in a moment].’ But they fell on their faces.”
11 (Numb. 16:22) “And they said”: They said to him, “Master of the world, in the case of a king when a province rebels against him, when they persist in cursing the king or his deputies, ten or twenty of them, he sends out his legions<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>legiones</i>.</i> and carries out reprisals<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>androlempsia</i> (=<i>androlepsia</i>).</i> against it. So he kills the good with the evil, because he does not know who among them has rebelled and who has not rebelled, who has honored the king and who has cursed him. You, however, know the thoughts of every person, even what the hearts and the reins counsel and You understand the drives of Your creatures. So You know who has sinned and who has not sinned, who has rebelled and who has not rebelled, for You know the spirit of each and every person.” It is therefore stated (in Numb. 20:22), “O God, the God of all human spirits; will one man sin.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “You have spoken well. I am making the matter known, who has sinned and who has not sinned.”
12 (Numb. 16:23–24) “And the Lord spoke to Moses saying, [...] ‘Get away from about the dwellings of Korah’”: Although Moses heard it from the mouth of the Almighty, he did not tell them to get away until he had gone and warned them, as stated (in vs. 25), “Then Moses arose and went unto Dathan and Abiram.” [This serves] to make their wickedness known, for although Moses went to them on foot, the[se] wicked ones were too stubborn to make amends. What did they do? They were unwilling to come out of their tents (different text: on their own) to face him. When Moses saw this, he said, “This much [only] it was incumbent upon me to do.” [So] (in Numb. 16:26) “And he spoke to the congregation, ‘Please move away from the tents of [these] wicked people.’” Our masters have taught: Four [types of people] are called wicked:<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>PRK</i> 30 (p.190b in Buber text; “Additional Piska” 28:2 in Braude’s translation).</i> The one who extends his hand against his companion to strike him. Even though he did not [actually] strike him, he is called wicked, as stated (in Exod. 2:13), “so he said to the wicked one, ‘Why would you strike<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the verb in accord with post-biblical usage and is stressing the fact that the tense is future. So also <i>Sanh.</i> 58b; Rashi on Exod.2:13.</i> your comrade?’” "Did you strike," is not stated here, but “would you strike.” The one who borrows and does not repay, as stated (in Ps. 37:21), “The wicked person borrows but does not repay […].”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Avot</i> 2:9.</i> The one who has an insolent face and does not feel shame from someone greater than himself, as stated (Prov. 21:29), “A wicked person puts on a brazen face […].” And the one who is the author of dissension, as stated (in Numb. 16:26), “Please move away from the tents of these wicked men.” Now two [of these traits] were in Dathan and Abiram, [i.e.,] an insolent face and dissension (<i>mhlqt</i>). <i>Mhlqt</i> ("dissension") [is interpreted through its letters.] <i>M</i> is for <i>marah</i> ("bitter"); <i>h</i> is for <i>haron</i> ("anger"); <i>l</i> is for <i>lokin</i> ("lash"); <i>q</i> is for <i>qelalah</i> ("curse"); and <i>t</i> is for <i>to</i>'<i>evah</i> ("<i>abomination</i>"). But some say [that t stands for] <i>takhlit</i> ("end"), [since dissension] brings annihilation to the world. (Numb. 16:27) “So they got away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and Abiram”: When they saw this, how Israel had moved away from round about them, they came out cursing and blaspheming, as stated (ibid., cont.), “[they] came out standing (rt.: <i>ntsb</i>).” Now [it is stated] elsewhere (in I Sam. 17:16), “Then the Philistine drew near at dawn and in the evening; and he took his stand (rt.: <i>ytsb</i>) for forty days.”<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">On Goliath reviling Israel, see I Sam. 17:8-10.</i> (Numb. 16:28-29), “And Moses said, ‘By this you may know that the Lord has sent me…. If these die like the death of every man”: A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To the <i>shoshbin<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the bridal agent who guarded her interests at the consummation of the marriage.</i></i> of a king's daughter in whose hands lay the testimonials of her [virginity]. When one of the banqueters stood up before him and cursed the <i>shoshbin </i>and said, “The king's daughter has no virginity”; the <i>shoshbin</i> arose in the presence of the king and said to him, “If you do not have this person brought out in order to execute him in everyone's presence, I shall say, ‘Of course the king's daughter has no virginity.’” Immediately the king said, “It is better for me to kill this person, so that the <i>shoshbin</i> will not give out a bad name concerning my daughter.” Similarly Korah contended with Moses and said, “It was in his own heart and on his own that Moses had said all these things.” Moses began by saying in front of the Holy One, blessed be He then I also am saying (ibid., cont.), “If these die upon their beds in the way that people die, and physicians come and examine them the way all sick people are examined, then I will also deny [my mission] and say, ‘the Lord did not send me,’ and I have spoken from my own heart.” This is one of three prophets who spoke in this way: Elijah, Micah, and Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ySahn.</i> 10:1 (28a).</i> Elijah said (in I Kings 18:36–37), "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known today that You are God in Israel, that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your bidding. Answer me o Lord, answer me, so that this people may know that You, o Lord, are God; for You have turned their hearts backward” - [meaning,] if you do not answer me, I will say (ibid.), “You have turned their hearts backward.” So also Micah (identified here with Micaiah) said to Ahab (in I Kings 22:28), “If you return in peace,” then I too will say (ibid. cont.), “the Lord has not spoken through me.” And Moses also said (in Numb. 16:29), “If these die a natural death....” The Holy One said to him: “Moses, what do you want?” Moses said to Him, “Sovereign of the World, (in Numb. 16:30), ‘But if the Lord creates’; if You have created a mouth to the earth [from the beginning], well and good; but if not, ‘let the Lord create’ - He should create a mouth to it now.” The Holy One said to him (in Job 22:28), “When you decree something, it shall come to pass for you; and light shall shine upon your ways.”
13 (Numb. 16:32) “And [the earth] opened”: R. Judah says, “At that time a lot of mouths into the earth were opened. It is so stated (in Deut. 11:6), ‘in the midst of all Israel.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., there were openings over all of Israel, one for each follower of Korah.</i> R. Nehemiah said, “But note what is written (in Numb. 16:32), ‘And the earth opened its mouth (with mouth in the singular).’” He said to him, “Then how do you reconcile, ‘in the midst of all Israel?’ It is simply that the earth became like a funnel; and from wherever one of them was standing in relation to him (i.e., to Korah), he rolled and went down with him. [Hence] you have succeeded in reconciling ‘in the midst of all Israel,’ and you have succeeded in reconciling ‘and the earth opened its mouth.’” (Deut. 11:6), “And everything substantial (<i>yequm</i>) [which followed in their footsteps (literally: which was in their feet)]”: This is wealth (<i>mamon</i>), since it puts a person  on one's feet.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>yequm</i> (“something substantial”) comes from the root, <i>QWM</i>, which has the causative meaning, “raise up,” the word is taken to mean something which causes one to rise.</i> Our masters said, “Even if they had garments at the cleaner, they (i.e., the garments) came rolling and were swallowed up along with them.” R. Samuel bar Nahmani said, “Even a needle which had been borrowed (<i>Sh'WLH</i>) from them by an Israelite, it also was swallowed up along with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ySahn.</i> 10:1 (28a).</i> It is so stated (in Numb. 16:33), ‘so they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol(<i>Sh'WLH</i>).’”<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with what had been borrowed (<i>Sh’WLH</i>).</i> Why all this? Because he had sided against the Holy One. But nevertheless, in the world to come they are going to rise.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ARN,</i> A, 36; <i>Sanh.</i> 10:3; also <i>Sanh.</i> 109b; 110b.</i> R. Judah ben Betera teaches that they do have a share in the world to come. It is so stated (in Numb. 16:33, cont.), ‘and they vanished from the midst of the community.’” About David it [likewise] states (in Ps. 119:176), “I have gone astray like a lost (rt. '<i>bd</i>) sheep; seek out Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments.” Just as a loss (rt. '<i>BD</i>), which is written concerning David, is going to be searched for; so (in Numb. 16:33) this loss (rt. '<i>BD</i>) is going to be searched for. So also you find that Hannah prayed for them in a prayer<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tefillah.</i> This word suggests the Eighteen Benedictions (<i>Shemoneh ‘Esreh</i>), which is also called the <i>tefillah.</i> Moreover I Sam. 2:6 contains wording similar to the second of these prayers, which concerns the resurrection.</i> (in I Sam. 2:6), “The Lord brings death and gives life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.”

19 (Numb. 16:31) “Then it came to pass, as soon as he had finished speaking […], that the ground under them was split apart”: [This is] to teach you He causes retribution to spring up from any place that He wants. (Numb. 16:33) “So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol”: Some say they are alive and preserved up to the present. (Ibid., cont.) “Then the earth closed over them”: They perished but not their offices; indeed, other were appointed captains of thousands and captains of hundreds in their stead. (Numb. 16:34) “Then all Israel […] fled at their cry”; since they cried out to Moses, “Moses our master, save us!” (Numb. 16:35) “And a fire went forth from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men offering the incense”: These had been swallowed up, but those were burned; and Korah stood among those who were burned, as Moses had said (in Numb. 16:17), “you also and Aaron, each his censer.” Moreover, Korah received more [punishment] than all of them, in that he was [both] burned and swallowed up. And why were both sentences carried out against him? Because if he had been burned but not swallowed up, those who were swallowed up would have complained and said that though only Korah had brought retribution upon them, here they were being swallowed up while he escaped. But if he had been swallowed up and not burned, those who were burned would have complained and said, “Although only Korah brought this retribution upon us, here we are burned while he escaped.” For that reason he was condemned to both deaths. First, he was set ablaze in the sight of all who were being burned, in whose hand was the censer with the incense in it; and [then] the fire rolled him up like a ball. And the fire rolled him along until it brought him to the mouth of the earth among those being swallowed up, as stated (in Numb. 16:32), “And the earth opened its mouth […].”
20 (Numb. 16:1) “And On ben Peleth”: Why was he named On (which means "sorrow")?<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh. 109b-110a</i>.</i> Because he remained in sorrow all his days. (Ibid.) “Ben Peleth (<i>plt</i>)?” The son of (<i>ben</i>) one for whom miracles (<i>pl'wt</i>) have been performed. Rav said, “On ben Peleth had his wife save him; for she said to him, ‘What has this dispute to do with you? If Aaron is the high priest, you are a disciple; if Korah is high priest, you are [still] a disciple].’ She said to him, ‘I know that the whole community is holy, since it is written (in Numb. 16:3), “for all the congregation are holy.”’ What did she do? She gave him wine to drink, got him drunk, and had him lie down in her bed. Then she sat down at the entrance [of the house] – her and her daughter – and let down her hair.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">It was immodest to look at a married woman’s loosened hair.</i> Everyone who came for her husband On saw her and returned. In the meanwhile they were swallowed up.” It is this which is written (in Prov. 14:1), “The wisdom of women builds its house,” this refers to the wife of On; “but folly tears it down with its own hands,” this refers to the wife of Korah.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh</i>. 110a describes how she joined her husband in his rebellion.</i> (Numb. 16:2) “And they rose up against Moses, […] princes of the congregation,” the special ones of the congregations; “chosen by the assembly (<i>moed</i>),” because they knew how to intercalate years<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., add an extra month in order to keep the lunar year in line with the solar year.</i> and fix new moons (which determine the date of the festival (<i>moed</i>);<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">R. 18:20, cont.; <i>Sanh</i>. 110a.</i> “men of renown,” in that they had a name throughout the whole [world]. (Numb. 16:4) “When Moses heard this, he fell on his face”: What news did he hear? R. Samuel bar Nachmani said that R. Jonathan said, “[This] teaches that they suspected him of [adultery with] a married woman.” Thus it is stated (in Ps. 106:16), “And they were jealous (rt.: <i>qn</i>')<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Numb.5:14 where this word is used to denote suspicion of adultery.</i> of Moses in the camp.” Rav Samuel bar Isaac said that Rav said, “[This] teaches that each and every one suspected (rt.: <i>qn</i>') his wife of adultery with Moses.” Reish Lakish says, “From here we derive that one may not perpetuate a dispute.” Rav says, “Anyone who perpetuates a dispute violates a prohibition. It is so stated (in Numb. 17:5), ‘and he will not be like Korah and his assembly.’” Rav Ashi says, “He is fit to be afflicted with leprosy. It is written here (in Numb. 17:5, cont.), ’by the hand of Moses to him,’ and it is written there (in Exod. 4:6), ‘And the Lord said furthermore to him, “Put now your hand into your bosom.”’” Rav Ḥisda says, “Anyone who disagrees with his teacher is like one who disagrees with the Divine Presence, as it is stated [with regard to Dathan and Abiram] (in Numb. 26:9), ‘when they strove against the Lord.’” R. Jose, son of R. Ḥanina, says, “Anyone who initiates a quarrel [<i>meriva</i>] with his teacher is like one who initiates a quarrel with the Divine Presence, as it is stated (in Numb. 20:13), “These are the waters of Meribah, where the Children of Israel quarreled with the Lord.’” R. Ḥanina says, “Anyone who expresses resentment against his teacher for wronging him, it is as though he is expressing resentment against the Divine Presence, as it is stated (Exod. 16:8), ‘your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.’” R. Abbahu says, “Anyone who suspects his teacher of wrongdoing, it is as though he suspects the Divine Presence, as it is stated (in Numb. 21:5), ‘And the people spoke against God, and against Moses[…].’” Rabba expounded that which is written (in Hab. 3:11), “Sun and moon remain on high (<i>zevul</i>)”:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Sanh</i>. 110a.</i> [This] teaches that the sun and moon ascended to <i>Zebul</i> and said to Him, “Master of the world, if You act justly toward the son of Amram, we shall go forth; but if not, we shall not go forth.” [So they refused to shine,] until He hurled darts at them. He said to them, “For My honor you did not protest,<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., when people dishonored the Holy One by worshiping the sun and the moon.</i> but for flesh and blood you did protest.” And at the present time until they are hit, they do not come out.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash draws of the second half of Hab. 3:11 to show that the Holy One must use arrows and a spear to force the sun and moon to shine.</i> Rabba expounded what is written (in Numb. 16:30), “But if the Lord creates something new, [and the earth opens its mouth]”: Moses said, “Master of the World, if <i>gehinnom</i> is created, all the better; but if not, ‘the Lord creates.’” To what [does the verse refer]? If we say to an actual creation of something, then is it not written (in Eccl. 1:9), “For there is nothing new under the sun.” Rather [it refers] to bringing the opening (into <i>gehinnom</i>) up close (to the surface of the earth where Korah was standing).<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash sees the swallowing up of Korah and his companions as the first evidence for <i>gehinnom</i>. See Numb.

22 Blessed be the name of the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, who created His world in wisdom and understanding; for His wonders have no limit and His greatness is beyond reckoning. (Ps. 33:7:) “He has gathered the waters of the sea like a mound, and He has put the deeps in storehouses.” Now what is the meaning of “He gathers like a mound?” When the Holy One, blessed be He, created the world, He said to the ministering angel of the sea, “Open your mouth and swallow all the waters of creation,”<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote"><i>BB</i> 74b.</i> he said [back] to Him, “Master of the world, it is enough for me to continue with what is [already] mine.” Then he began to weep. [So God] kicked him to death, as stated (in Job 26:12), “In His power He stilled the sea, and in His understanding He struck down Rahab.” You find that the ministering angel of the sea was named Rahab. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He subdued [the waters] and trampled them down; and [the sea] accepted them, as stated (in Amos 4:13), “He tramples on the heights<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">M. Pss. 93:5. Cf. Gen. R. 23:7, according to which the sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) is higher than the whole world.</i> of the earth.” So for [the waters] He set sand in place as bar and gates, according to what is stated (in Job 38:8, 10), “And [who] blocked off the sea with doors […. and I set bar and gates in place].” Moreover, it says (in Jer. 5:22), “’Do you not fear Me,’ says the Lord; ‘Will you not tremble because of Me, when I have placed sand as a boundary for the sea?’” And it says (in Job 38:11), “And I said, ‘You may come this far and no farther.’” Then the sea said to Him, “My Master, in that case my sweet waters will be mingled with the salt [waters]!” He said to it, “No! Each and every one will have a storehouse for itself, as stated (in Ps. 33:7), “and he has put the deeps in storehouses.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 4:5.</i> If you should say that this is a great wonder for the waters of the seas not to mingle, then consider the face,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRTsWP</i>, an adaptation of the Gk.: <i>prosopon.</i></i> which the Holy One, blessed be He, created in people. [Although only] the [size of] a full <i>sit</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi on <i>Shab.</i> 106a, a single <i>sit</i> was the distance between the tips of the of the middle and index fingers when held widely apart. A double <i>sit</i> was the distance between the tips of the thumb and index finger when held widely apart. For various definitions, see Jastrow, p. 977, s.v. <i>SYT</i>.</i> it has so many springs (from '<i>yn</i>); yet they do not mingle with one another. The waters of the eyes ('<i>yn</i>) are salty; the waters of the ears are oily; the waters of the nose are putrid; the waters of the mouth are sweet. For what reason are the waters of the eyes salty? Because when someone weeps for the dead, [doing so] all the time, he would immediately become blind; however, because [tears] are salty, he stops and does not weep. For what reason are the waters of the ears oily? Because when a person hears bad news, if he held it in his ears, it would be tied to him and he would die. Because they are oily, [the news] goes in one ear and out the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “[A person] admits [bad news] through one [ear], and discharges it through the other.”</i> For what reason are the waters of the nose putrid? Because when a person smells a bad odor, if the waters of the nose were not putrid [enough] to stop it, he would immediately die. And for what reason are the waters of the mouth sweet? It sometimes happens that someone eats food that does not agree with him [and he vomits]. Now if the waters of the mouth were not sweet, he would not recover. Moreover, since he reads the Torah, of which it is written (in Ps. 19:11), “sweeter also than honey,” the waters of the mouth are therefore sweet. Now here are the grounds for arguing a fortiori (<i>qal wehomer</i>), that if [something the size of] a full <i>sit</i> has so many springs [without them mingling with one another], how much the more so in the case of the Great Sea, of which it is stated (in Ps. 104:25), “There the sea is great and wide […].” [This is] to teach that in everything, the Holy One, blessed be He, accomplishes His mission and that He has not created one thing in vain. Sometimes the Holy One, blessed be He, has accomplished His mission by means of a frog, by means of a gnat,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">See Lev. R. 22:2-3; Eccl. R. 5:8:2, 4; <i>PRE</i> 49; also <i>Shab.</i> 77b; Exod. R. 10:1.</i> by means of a wasp, or by means of a scorpion. R. Hanan of Sepphoris said,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. R. 10:7; Lev. R. 22:4; Eccl. R. 5:8:5.</i> “There is a story about a certain scorpion that went to carry out the Holy One, blessed be He's mission (to sting a certain person) beyond the Jordan; so the Holy One, blessed be He, summoned a certain frog for him, and he crossed over upon it. Then that scorpion went and stung [the] person. [There is] also a story about a certain reaper who stood and reaped in the valley of Beth-Tofet. When burning heat came, he took grass and tied it on his head. [When] a certain mighty serpent came at him, he killed it. A certain [snake] charmer passed by him. He saw the slain serpent. He said to him, ‘Who killed that serpent?’ [So the reaper] said to him ‘I [did].’ He looked at the grass on his head. He [then] said to him, ‘Remove the grass from your head and [then you can brag (if you still have that power)].’ When he did so, [the charmer] drew near. He had not succeeded in touching him, before [the reaper’s] body parts [all] shed.” R. Jannay was sitting as a judge at the gate of his city, [when] he saw a serpent hissing and coming toward the city. Each time someone would secure against it in one place, it would go to another. He said, “It seems to me that this [serpent] is on its way to carry out its mission.” When it entered the city, a rumor spread in the city, “So-and-so son of so-and-so was bitten by a serpent and he is dead.” R. Elazar was strolling by the seashore of Caesarea. He found a femur bone strewn on the path. [So] he removed it from there, but he found it there again; he removed it from there [a second time] and found it there again. He said, “It seems to me that this [bone] is arranged to carry out its mission.” After [some] days, a minister came and fell over it and died. They looked into him and found evil documents against the Jews in his hand. There is a story about two people who were walking on the way. One who could see, and one was blind. They sat down to eat. They reached out their hands for the herbs of the field and ate. The one who could see became blind, and the one who had been blind became sighted. They did not move from there until the former was being supported by the latter whom he had been supporting. There is a story about a certain person who was going from the land of Israel to Babylon.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 22:4.</i> While he was eating, he saw two birds fighting with each other. One of them killed its companion. Then going to get an herb, [it placed it on its mouth,] and made it live again. That person (the one who saw what had happened) went and took the very herb that had fallen from the bird. Then he went to make the dead live with it. When he arrived at the Ladder of Tyre,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">A well-known landing dock four hours north of Tyre. See ‘<i>Eruv.</i> 80a.</i> he found a dead lion lying in the open. He touched the herb to its mouth and made it live. The lion got up and ate him. The proverb says, “Do not do good to the evil, and evil will not happen to you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 22:8.</i> There is a story of Shihin (a town near Sepphoris) about a certain blind person who went down to bathe in the waters in a cave. He happened upon the well of Miriam, immersed [himself in it], and was healed. Titus the wicked entered the interior of the holy of holies.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Git</i>. 56b; Lev. R. 22:3.</i> When he had cursed and blasphemed, he stood up and slashed the veil. Then he took a Torah scroll and brought it out. Next he unrolled it; and bringing two whores, he transgressed upon them. Then he drew his sword to cut up the book. A miracle took place in that blood began to spew forth from it. He began to boast, saying that he had killed himself (i.e. God).<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The author is avoiding too literal a description of the sacrilege and therefore substitutes “himself” for God as a euphemism.</i> He began to become bolder and bolder. When he reached the sea, the sea began to grow stormier and stormier. He said, “The God of these people only has power in the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Pes</i>. 118b.</i> Now if He would, let Him go up on the dry land. Then let us see who overcomes.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “O you wicked one, son of a wicked one, I am sending against you a tiny creature, the least of My creatures, to eradicate you from the world.” A gnat entered his nostril, and he died an unnatural death. Why is it named a base creature? Because it takes in but does not excrete. Moreover, sometimes it is by means of a hornet [that God's will is carried out]. Thus it is written (in Exod. 23:28), “I will send the hornet before you [to drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from before you].” Our masters have said, “When the Holy One, blessed be He, sent the hornet before Israel to kill the Amorites, see what was written about them (in Amos 2:9), “Yet I destroyed the Amorites before them, whose stature was like the cedars in height and who were as strong as the oaks [...].” It entered one's right eye and poured out its poison in it. Then [that person] burst open and dropped dead. This indeed is the way of the Holy One, blessed be He, to carry out His missions by means of small things against all who vaunt themselves against Him. He sends them a small creature to exact punishment from them, in order to inform them that there is no substance to their might. Also in the future to come the Holy One, blessed be He, is going to exact punishment from the [idol-worshiping] peoples of the world by means of small things. It is so stated (in Is. 7:18–19), “And it shall come to pass on that day that the Lord shall whistle for the fly. [They all shall come …].”

Chapter 19

1 (Numb. 19:2) “This is the statute of the Torah.” This text is related (to Job 14:4), “Who can produce something clean out of something unclean; is it not One?”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">English translations usually translate these last four words as NO ONE.</i> [Who], for example, [produced] Abraham out of Terah, Hezekiah out of Ahaz, Josiah out of Amon, Mordecai out of Shimei, Israel out of the nations of the world, the world to come out of this world?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK,</i> 4:1.</i> [So] who did so?

Who did so? Who decreed so? Who commanded so? Is it not One? Is it not the Singular Being of the World? We have learned elsewhere (in <i>Hul</i>. 4:3), “In the case of the woman whose fetus died within her belly, if [a midwife] inserted her hand [into the womb] and touched it, the midwife is unclean for seven days, but the woman remains clean until the fetus comes forth. And so it is that while the dead person is in the house, the house is clean; when he comes forth from it, he makes it unclean.” Who did this? Is it not One? Is it not the Singular Being of the World? We have learned elsewhere (in <i>Parah</i> 4:4; <i>Hul</i>. 29b), “All who are occupied with the [rite of the red] cow from beginning to end render [their] clothes unclean, while the [cow] herself makes clothes clean.” Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, has said, “I have enacted a statute for you; I have issued a decree! So you are not authorized to transgress against my decree.”
2 (Numb. 19:2) “This is the statute of the Torah”: R. Tanhum bar Hanila'i opened [his discourse] (with Ps. 12:7), “The sayings of the Lord are pure sayings.” R. Joshua ben Levi said, “We find that the Torah has twisted two or three words in the Torah, so as not to bring forth something unclean from His (i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He's) mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to the parallels for the last section, see Gen.

Judan said, “When He came to introduce the signs of an unclean beast, He only began with the signs of purity. It is not written here (in Lev. 11:4), ‘the camel, because it does not have a cloven hoof,’ but “[the camel] because it chews its cud [but does not have a cloven hoof].’ It is not written here (in Lev. 11:6), ‘The hare, because it does not have a hoof,’ but ‘[The hare], because it chews its cud [but does not have a cloven hoof].’ It is not written (in Lev. 11:7), ‘The pig, because it does not chew its cud,’ but ‘[the pig], because it has a cloven hoof [and is cleft footed, but does not chew its cud].’” R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R.

3 (Numb. 19:2) “This is the statute of the Torah”: R. Isaac began [his discourse] (with Eccl. 7:23), “All this I tested with wisdom; I thought I could fathom it, but it eludes me.” It is written (in I Kings 5:9), “So God gave Solomon wisdom [...].” What is the meaning of (I Kings 5:9, cont.,) “As vast as the sand of the sea.” The rabbis say, “[This] teaches that He gave him as much wisdom as all Israel, who are compared to the sand, as stated (in Hos. 2:1), ‘The number of the Children of Israel shall be like that of the sands of the sea. R. Levi said, “Just as sand is a wall and a fence for [the sea], that it not go out and flood the world; so was wisdom a fence for Solomon.” The proverb says, “If you lack knowledge, what have you gained? If you have gained knowledge, what do you lack?” Like (in Prov. 25:28) “A city broken into with no walls,” so “is a person who does not restrain his spirit.” (I Kings 5:10) “Now Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East”: And what was the wisdom of the peoples of the East?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Above, Gen. 7:24; <i>PR</i> 14:9.</i> [In that] they were astute at divination (from birds). Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said, “I like three things, etc.” (I Kings 5:10, cont.) “From all the wisdom of Egypt”: What was the wisdom of Egypt? You find that when Solomon wanted to build the Temple, he sent to Pharaoh Necho and said to him, “Send me craftsmen [to work] for a wage, for I want to build the Temple.” What did Pharaoh do? He gathered all his astrologers<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>astrologoi.</i></i> and said to them, “Foresee which people are going to die this year and send them to him.” When they came to Solomon, he foresaw through the holy spirit that they would die during that year. He [therefore] gave them shrouds and sent them [back] to [Pharaoh]. He sent to him, saying, “Do you not have shrouds to bury your dead? Here they are for you with their shrouds.” (I Kings 5:11) “And he was wiser than any man (literally, than all of Adam),” than the first Adam. And what was his wisdom? You find that, when the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to create the first Adam, He consulted with the ministering angels. He said to them (in Gen. 1:26), “Let us make humankind (<i>Adam</i>) in Our image.” They said to him (in Ps. 8:5), “What is a human that You are mindful of him?” He said to them, “This Adam that I want to create Adam shall have wisdom greater than yours.” What did He do? He gathered all cattle, wild beasts, and fowl to pass before them. He said to them, “What are the names of these [beings]?” They, however, did not know. When He had created Adam, He made them pass before him. He said to him, “What are the names of these [beings]?” He said, “It is fitting to call this one an ox, this one a lion, this one a horse, [...]” and so on for all of them. It is so stated (in Gen. 2:20), “So Adam recited names”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The understanding of the midrash is that the creatures implicitly already possessed names.</i> He said to him, “And you, what is your name?” Adam said to him, “Adam, because I was created out of the ground (<i>adamah</i>).” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I, what is My name?” He said to him, “The Lord, because you are Lord over all creatures,” namely as written (in Is. 42:8), “I am the Lord, that is My name,” which the first Adam gave me. It is the one which I have agreed to [for use] between Me and Myself; it is the one which I have agreed to [for use] between Me and My creatures. (I Kings 5:11, cont.) “[Wiser] than Ethan the Ezrahite”: This is Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Ps. 89:1), “A <i>maskil</i> (a psalm of erudition) of Ethan the Ezrahite.”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">It is assumed, of course that Abraham wrote the Psalm, an assumption based on a comparison of Ps. 89:1 and Is. 41:2: WHO HAS RAISED UP RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM THE EAST?.

Solomon merely said, “For what reason is a leper cleansed through the tallest among the trees (the cedar) and through the lowest of the low (the hyssop); through (according to Lev. 14:4) cedar wood, [crimson stuff,] and hyssop?’ It is simply because he had exalted himself like the cedar, that he was stricken with leprosy. As soon as he humbled himself like the hyssop, he was therefore cured through hyssop”. (I Kings 5:13, cont.) “He also spoke with/concerning ('<i>al</i>) the cattle and the fowl”: Is it possible that [a person] would speak with cattle and with fowl? Rather [the passage is concerned with] why the cattle are permitted [as food] with [the cutting of] two organs<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeia</i> (“signs,” “omens”).</i> (the gullet and the windpipe); but the fowl, with [the cutting of] one organ (i.e., the gullet or the windpipe).<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Hul</i>. 2:1; <i>Hul.</i> 27b.</i> Because cattle were created from the dry land.

Solomon merely said, “For what reason do cattle, beasts, and birds require ritual slaughtering, while fish do not require ritual slaughtering?” Rather it is from this verse (in Numb. 11:22), “Are there enough flocks and herds to slaughter for them; [are there enough fish in the sea to gather for them]?” Jacob the man of Kefar Nibburayya taught in Tyre with respect to fish, that they do require ritual slaughtering. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him, “On what basis did you decide this?” He said to him, “From here (in Gen. 1:20), ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let the fowl fly.’ Just as fowl require ritual slaughtering, so do the fish require ritual slaughtering.” He said to them (i.e., those standing by), “Lay him down to receive lashes.” He said to him, “Shall a person who speaks words of Torah be lashed?” He said to him, “You did not decide [the law] well.” He said to him, “On what basis?” He said to him, “From here (in Numb. 11:22), ‘Are there enough flocks and herds to slaughter for them; are there enough fish in the sea to gather for them?’ The former require ritual slaughtering, while the latter [is taken] through gathering.” He said to him, “Give [me] your beating, as it is good for retention.” And again did Jacob the man of Kefar Nibburayya teach in Tyre, [this time] with respect to an Israelite man, who came upon a foreign woman and had her bear him a son, that he should be circumcised on the Sabbath. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him, “On what basis do you hold this?” He said to him, “[From this which is written] (in Numb. 1:18) ‘then they registered their lineages according to their families according to the house of their fathers.’” He said to them (i.e., those standing by), “Lay him down to receive lashes.” He said to him, “Shall a person who speaks words of Torah be lashed?” He said to him, “You did not decide [the law] well.” He said to him, “From where can you show me?” He said to him, “If one of the gentiles came to you in order to become a proselyte on condition that you circumcise him on the Sabbath day or on the Day of Atonement, would you profane the Sabbath on account of him or not? Is it not true that one does not profane the Sabbath or the Day of Atonement for him but only for the son of an Israelite woman.” He said to him, “On what basis do you hold this?” He said to him (in Ezra 10:3), “So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all (foreign) wives and (anyone] born of them […].” He said to him, “Would you lash me on the basis of [a non-Mosaic text]?” He said to him, “It is written (ibid.), ‘let it be done [according to] the Torah.’” He said to him, “From which [piece of] Torah?” He said to him, “From that of R. Johanan, when he said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay, ‘It is written (in Deut. 7:3), “You shall not intermarry with them; do not give your daughters to their sons.” Why? (As in Deut. 7:4,) “Because they will turn your children away from following me.” Your child that comes from an Israelite woman is called "your child"; but that which comes from a foreign woman is called, not "your child," but "her child,” as stated (in Gen. 21:13), “And I will also make the son of the maidservant into a nation.”’" He said to him, “Give [me] your beating, as it is good for retention.” Solomon said, “About all these things I have knowledge; but in the case of the <i>parashah</i> on the red heifer, I have investigated it, inquired into it, and examined it. [Still] (at the end of the verse in Eccl. 7:23), ‘I thought I could fathom it, but it eludes me.’” 
4 (Eccl. 8:1) “Who is like the wise person, and who knows the explanation of a saying”: (Eccl. 8:1) “Who is like the wise person”: This is the Holy One, blessed be He, since it is stated about Him (in Prov. 3:19), “Through wisdom the Lord founded the earth.”<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl.

(Eccl. 8:1, cont.) “A person's wisdom lights up his face”: R. Judan said, “Great is the power of the prophets, as they [are able to] compare the Almighty above to the form of a man, as stated (Daniel 8:16), ‘And I heard the voice of a man.’” And R. Judah bar Simon says [the proof] is from here (in Ezekiel 1:26), “and on the image of a chair was an image of a man […].” (Eccl. 8:1, cont.) “And the radiance ('<i>oz</i>) of his face is changed (for the better),” in that He changes the principle of judgment into a principle of mercy with respect to Israel. R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi, “Over each and every word that the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke to Moses, He spoke to him of its [related] uncleanness and of its purification.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. R. 19:4.</i> When he made known the <i>Parashah</i> (starting with Lev. 21:1), ‘Speak (<i>Emor</i>) unto the priests,’ [Moses] said to him, ‘Master of the world, if [a priest] becomes unclean (through touching a human corpse), what means is there for his purification?’ When [the Holy One, blessed be He,] did not answer, at that time the face of Moses turned yellow (with shame). Then when the Holy One, blessed be He, reached the <i>parashah</i> on the [red] heifer, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘Moses, [when I gave you] that saying which I spoke to you (in Lev. 21:1), “Go, speak unto the priests,” then you said to me, “If one becomes unclean, what means will there be for his purification,” I did not answer [you at that time. Now] this is his purification (in Numb. 19:17), “They shall take some ashes from the burning of the sin offering (i.e., the red heifer).”‘”
5 R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi, “There are four things that the evil drive would refute [as irrational], and for each of them is written [the word,] <i>huqqah</i> (i.e., an unquestioned statute).<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Although <i>Huqqah</i> is normally translated simply as “statute,” the word more fully denotes a command that demands implicit and unquestioned obedience. <i>Huqqah</i> is therefore translated “unquestioned statute” throughout this section.</i> Now these concern the following: (1) the nakedness of a brother's wife, (2) diverse kinds, (3) the scapegoat, and (4) the red heifer.”<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PR</i> 14:12; see <i>Yoma</i> 67b.</i> In regard to the nakedness of a brother's wife, it is written (in Lev. 18:16), “[You shall not uncover] the nakedness of your brother's wife”; [yet if the brother dies] without children [it is written] (in Deut. 25:5), “her brother-in-law shall have sexual intercourse with her [and take her for a wife].” And it is written about the sexual prohibitions (in Lev. 18:5), “And you shall keep [all] My unquestioned statutes [...].” In regard to diverse kinds, it is written (in Deut. 22:11), “You shall not wear interwoven stuff, [wool and flax together]”; yet a linen cloak<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>sindon</i>.</i> with [wool] tassels is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. 15:37-38.</i> And for [this commandment also] it is written, [that it is] an unquestioned statute. [Thus it is written (in Lev. 19:19),] “You shall keep My unquestioned statute. [You shall not mate your cattle with a different kind…, nor shall you wear a garment with diverse kinds of interwoven stuff].” In regard to the scapegoat, it is written (in Lev. 16:26), “And the one who sets the azazel-goat free shall wash his clothes”; yet it is [the goat] itself that atones for others. And for [this commandment also] it is written (in Lev. 16:34), “And this shall be to you an unquestioned statute forever.” In regard to the red heifer, where is it shown? Since we are taught (in <i>Parah</i> 4:4), “All engaged with the [rite of the red] heifer from beginning to end render [their] garments unclean”; yet it is [the heifer] itself that purifies garments. And for [this commandment also] it is written, [that it is] an unquestioned statute. Thus it is written (in Numb. 19:2), “This is an unquestioned statute of the Torah.”
6 (Numb. 19:2, cont) “That they bring unto you [a red heifer without blemish]”: R. Jose bar Hanina said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses. ‘To you I am revealing the reason for the heifer, but to others it is an unquestioned statute.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 4:7; <i>PR</i> 14:13.</i> As Rav Huna said, “It is written (in Ps. 75:3), ‘For I will set a time, when I Myself will judge with equity.’ It is also written (in Zech. 14:6), ‘On that day there shall be no light of cold and frost (<i>veqipaon</i>).’<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>Pes</i>. 50a.</i> It is [however actually] written <i>yiqpeun</i> (will float up). Things that are hidden from you in this world are going to be clear to you in the world to come, as with the blind person who gains his sight. Thus it is stated (in Is. 42:16), ‘I will lead the blind by a road they do not know, [… these things I have done].’ ‘I will do’ is not stated here, but ‘I have done,’ in that I have already done them for R. Aqiva and his colleagues.” Things that were not revealed to Moses were revealed to R. Aquiva and his colleagues (as found in Job 28:10), “his eye sees every precious thing” – this refers to R. Aquiva and his colleagues. R. Jose bar Hanina said, “It was implied (in Numb. 19:2) that all heifers perish, but [Moses’] lasts forever.” 
7 R. Aha said in the name of R. Jose bar Hanina, “When Moses ascended into the firmament, he heard the voice of the Holy One, blessed be He, sitting and being occupied with the <i>parashah</i> of the [red heifer], and he was reciting a <i>halakhah</i> (i.e., a passage of oral Torah) in the name of its author (from <i>Parah</i> 1:1), ‘R. Eliezer says, “The calf [whose neck is to be broken]<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut. 21:3-4.</i> is to be one year old, but the [red] heifer is to be two years old.”’<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">See Braude’s translation of <i>PR</i>, 14:13 p. 290, n. 91, which records a suggestion of Mordecai Margulies, who notes that R.

In the biblical context the translation would normally read: AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER WAS ELIEZER.</i> was Eliezer,’ [i.e.,] the name of that particular one [who would begin his teaching with Tractate <i>Parah</i>].
8 A certain stranger questioned Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay, “These things which you do seem like a kind of sorcery.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 4:7; <i>PR</i> 14:14.</i> You bring a heifer, burn it, pound it, and take its ashes. Then [when] one of you is defiled by a corpse, they sprinkle two or three drops on him, and you say to him, ‘You are clean.’” He said to him, “Have you ever had a bad spirit of madness enter you?” He told him, “No.” He said to him, “Perhaps you have seen someone into whom a bad spirit has entered?” He told him, “Yes.” He said to him, “So what did you do for him?” He said to him, “They bring roots and burn them beneath him. Then they sprinkle water on [the spirit], and it flees.” He said to him, “Let your ears hear what you are uttering with your mouth. Similarly is this spirit an unclean spirit. Thus it is stated (in Zech. 13:2), ‘and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.’ They sprinkle the purifying water upon him, and he flees.” After the gentile had left, [R. Johanan's] disciples said to him, “Our master, you repelled this one with a [mere] reed [of an answer]. What have you to say to us?” He said to them, “By your lives, a corpse does not defile, nor does the water purify. Rather, the Holy One, blessed be He, has said, ‘I have enacted a statute for you. I have issued a decree, [and] you are not allowed to transgress against my decree.’” Thus it is written (in Numb. 19:2), “This is the statute of the Torah.” And for what reason are all the sacrifices male, while that one is [only] female?<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>PRK</i> 4:8.</i> R. Ayyevu said, “It is comparable to the son of a female slave who defiled a king's palace.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>praetorium</i> Gk.: <i>praitoriom.</i></i> The king said, ‘Let his mother come and clean up the excrement.’ Similarly has the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘Let a heifer come and atone for the incident of the [golden] calf.’”
9 (Numb. 20:8) “Take the rod... and you shall provide the congregation and their cattle with water”: From here it is shown that the Holy One, blessed be He, is concerned for Israel's wealth. (Ibid., vs. 10) “So Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation before the rock.” And similarly it says (in Lev. 8:3), “And assemble the whole congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.” [The verse] teaches that each and every person sees himself as if he were standing at the rock. And so too when they crossed the Jordan, all of Israel fit in between the two poles of the ark, as stated (in Josh. 3:9), “And Joshua said to the Children of Israel, ‘Come closer and listen to the words of the Lord your God.” And it is [also] written (in Josh. 8:33), “All Israel [...] stood on either side of the ark.” Here also all Israel was standing and seeing the miracles which happened at the rock [in front of them]. They began to say, “Moses knows the natural properties of rock. If he wants, he will bring forth water out of this [other] one.” Moses found himself confronted with a dilemma: If he would listen to them, he would disregard the words of the Omnipresent; and the Holy One, blessed be He, (according to Job 5:13) “Catches the wise in their own cunning.” As for the whole of these forty years Moses had been keeping himself from becoming angry with them, because he was afraid of the oath that the Holy One, blessed be He, had sworn (in Deut. 1:35), “Not one of these people from this evil generation shall see [the good land].” They said to him, “Here is a rock. Just as you wish to bring [water] from another rock, you should bring it from this one.” He yelled at them (in Numb. 20:10), “Please listen, you rebels, shall we bring forth [water for you] from this rock.” There are many understandings of “<i>hamorim</i> (rebels).” <i>Hamorim</i> is rebels; <i>hamorim </i>is fools, as in the islands of the sea they call fools, <i>morim</i>. Some say<i> hamorim</i> are those that [inappropriately] instruct their teachers. <i>Hamorim</i> [can also be] arrows, as stated (in I Sam 31:3), “and some of the arrows (<i>morim</i>) struck him, men [with bows]”; (I Chron. 10:3), “those shooting (<i>morim</i>)  with the bow.” (Numb. 20:11) “Then Moses raised his hand and struck”: [When] he struck one time, the rock began dribbling a little water, as stated (in Ps. 78:20), “See, he struck a rock, and water trickled out (<i>yazuvu</i>),” like a person with a discharge (<i>zav</i>), in that it dribbles [in] drops. They said to him, “Son of Amram, is this water for nursing children or for babes weaned from milk?” Immediately, he became angry with them, struck it (according to Numb. 20:11) “twice [with his rod], and a lot of water came forth,” and it washed away any one who had been mocking them, as stated (in Ps. 78:20), “streams washed away.” Yet for all that, Moses only made [water] from the rock that the Holy One, blessed be He, had told him. And how do we see that they also brought out water from the rock that Israel had said to him and every rock and stone that was in that place? It is so stated (in Ps. 78:15), “He split rocks in the desert.” Why was Aaron punished? As it states (Numb. 20:12), “But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, ‘Because you did not trust in Me.’” The matter is comparable to a creditor who came to take the threshing floor of the borrower [as repayment, and] takes his and his neighbor’s. The borrower says to him, “If I am in debt, what is my poor neighbor’s sin?” So too did Moses say to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, “I got angry, [but] what is Aaron’s sin?” Therefore the verse lauds<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>QLS</i>; cf. Gk.: <i>kalos.</i></i> [Aaron] (in Deuteronomy 33:8), “And of Levi he said, ‘Let Your <i>thummim</i> and <i>urim</i> be with Your faithful one whom you tested at Massah.’” 
10 (Numb. 20:12) “Because you did not trust in Me”: Did not Moses say something worse than this? As he said (in Numb. 11:22), “Are there [enough] flocks and herds to slaughter for them; [are there enough fish in the sea to gather for them?” There also trust was lacking, and [that lack of trust] was greater than this one. So why did the Holy One, blessed be He, not decree death for him there? The matter is comparable to a king who had a friend. Now when in private he displayed arrogance towards the king with harsh words, the king did not become angry with him. [When, however,] he arose one day and was arrogant in front of the legions,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>legiones</i>.</i> he decreed death for him. So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Moses, “When you acted privately with Me, I did not become angry, but now [that you have acted] in public, it is impossible [to overlook your action].” Thus it is stated (in Numb. 20:12), “to sanctify Me in the sight of the Children of Israel.”
11 This text is related (to Eccl. 8:14), “Here is a vanity that occurs in the world: sometimes an upright man is requited according to the conduct of the scoundrel.” You find that when the Holy One, blessed be He, cursed the serpent and said to him (in Gen. 3:14), “You are cursed,” He did not allow him to make any claim. As the serpent could have said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, “You said to Adam, ‘Do not eat,’ and I said to him, ‘Eat.’ Who does one listen to, the words of the master or the words of the student? [So] why do You curse me?” He did not allow him to make any claim. And Aaron could have said, “I did not transgress Your words. Why should I die?” 
12 (Numb. 20:12) “Therefore you shall not lead this congregation”: The matter is comparable to two woman that were lashed in court. One had been corrupted (was unfaithful) and the other ate unripe fruit of the sabbatical year. The one that ate the unripe fruit of the sabbatical year said to them, “I plead with you to make known to the creatures why I am being lashed, so that they do not say, that I was also corrupted. [So] they brought the unripe fruit of the sabbatical year and suspended them upon her and announced and said, “This one was corrupted and was lashed, and that one ate unripe fruit from the sabbatical year and was lashed.” So too Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, see, You have decreed for me to die in the desert along with this wicked generation who angered You,” as stated (in Ps. 78:40), “How often did they defy Him in the desert and grieve Him in the wilderness.” “Now the [future] generations will say I was like them. Let it be written about me why I came to be punished.” It is therefore written (in Numb. 20:12), “because you did not trust in Me [to sanctify Me, therefore you will not bring].” 
13 The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “With what countenance do you want to enter the land?” The situation is comparable to a shepherd who went out to feed the king's flock, and the flock was carried off. [When] the shepherd wanted to come into the king's palace,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Lat. <i>palatium</i>; Gk.: <i>palation.</i></i> the king said to him, “If you come in now, what will the creatures say? That you caused the flock to be carried off.” Here also the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “[Would it be] your glory that you are the one who led sixty myriads out [of bondage] and buried them in the desert and are bringing another generation into [the land]. Now they will say, ‘The generation of the wilderness has no share in the world to come.’ Rather be by their side, and come along with them [in the future].” Thus it is stated (in Deut. 33:21), “[for there is an honored lawgiver's portion,] where he came at the head of the people....” Therefore it is stated (in Numb. 20:12), “therefore you shall not lead this congregation,” but rather [the one] that came out with you.

15 (Numb. 20:14) “Then Moses sent messengers [from Kadesh unto the king of Edom], ‘Thus says your brother Israel….’” This text is related (to Ps. 15:3), “[…] nor takes up a reproach against his relative.” By universal custom, when a person is engaged in business<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateia.</i></i> with his friend who causes a loss, he separates himself from him and does not want to see him. But although Moses was punished because of Israel, as stated (in Ps. 106:32), “And they provoked wrath at the Waters of Meribah and it went ill with Moses on their account,” he did not unload their burden from himself. Instead (according to Numb. 20:14), “Then Moses sent messengers.” (Numb. 20:14, cont.) “You know all the trouble that has befallen us”: They said to him, “You know when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham (in Gen. 15:13), ‘know full well that your seed shall be alien in a land not theirs where they shall serve them and be oppressed by them […],’ it was us who have been enslaved, while you are free.” (Numb. 20:15) “How our forefathers went down to Egypt [...]”: This whole subject is comparable to two brothers against whose grandfather a promissory note appeared. One of them arose and paid it. One day he started to ask a favor from his brother, and he said to him, “You know that debt was incumbent on both of us, but it was I who paid it. Do not refuse any of my favor that I am asking.” (Numb. 20:15) “How our forefathers went down [to Egypt]”: What is the relevance of [mentioning] the forefathers here, as stated (in Numb 20:15, cont.), “the Egyptians dealt harshly with us and our forefathers.” [It is to teach you] that all the time that Israel is in distress, [the forefathers] are also in distress. (Numb. 20:17) “Please let us pass through your land; [we will not pass through field or vineyard,] nor shall we drink water from a well”: Should it not have said, "water from cisterns?" [By this use of the singular, “a well”], the Torah has taught you proper conduct, [i.e.,] that though one has at hand his necessities, when he who goes to a land which is not his own, he should not eat from what he has on hand. Rather he should put aside what he has, and buy from the shopkeeper in order to benefit him. So also Moses said to [Edom], “[We have] a well with us,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">On the tradition of Israel’s portable well for supplying them with water during their desert wanderings, see Numb. R. 1:2; <i>TSuk.</i> 3:11; Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Numb. 21:16-18; Frag. Jerusalem Targum, Numb. 21:17-18; <i>Tanh</i>., Lev. 7:7; Lev.

You will make a profit for yourselves.” So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Moses (in Deut. 2:6), “Food shall you procure from them with money, and you shall eat.” And Moses said to Israel, “Open your purses to them. So that they do not say, ‘They were slaves and indigents,’ show them your wealth.” They will [then] know, so that they would not say, “You lost by your subjugation.” [As stated] (in Gen. 15:14.) “and in the end they shall go free with great wealth.” And they shall know that you are not lacking anything and that it is not from [that which is] yours that you are [spending], as stated (in Deut. 2:7), “For the Lord has blessed you in all the efforts of your hand [...].” (Numb. 20:17, cont.) “We shall go along the king's highway,” since we restrain<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hosemin.</i> The word also means “muzzle.”</i> our cattle. (Numb. 20:17, cont.) “Without turning right or left”: This was the most difficult [stipulation] of them all, for they said, “In all [the lands] around us we have permission to plunder and kill, but within your border [we shall walk the king's highway] without turning right or left [until we have passed through your territory].” (Numb. 20:18) “But Edom said unto him, “You shall not pass through me’”: This text is related to Ps. 120:7), “I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.” Where is it shown that the Holy One, blessed be He, also told them that they would not permit you to pass, [that] everything is not due to them, but [that] it is I who wills it? Where it is stated (in Deut. 2:5), “Do not engage them in battle, for I will not give you of their land.” And it is written (in Numb 20:21), “So Edom would not let [Israel cross their territory].” And afterwards, they sent [a request] to the king of Moab, and he would not let [Israel cross his territory either]. And even though it is not explained here, behold it is explained in Judges. [This] teaches that it was all [said] with the holy spirit. As there was no one lighter in all [the speakers] then Jephthah, and [yet] he explained [it]. It is so stated (in Jud. 11:17), “Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Allow us to cross your country’; but the king of Edom would not consent; they also sent a mission to the king of Moab, and he refused.” And Moses also indicated [this], as stated (in Deut. 2:29), “As the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir did for me, [and the Moabites who dwell in Ar].”
16 (Numb. 20:22) “Then setting out from Kadesh, the whole congregation [of the Children of Israel came to Mount Hor]”: This text is related (to II Chron. 20:37), “Because you have joined with Ahaziah,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Son of Ahab and a wicked king of Israel (I Kings 22:51-52), with whom Jehoshaphat had allied himself (I Kings 22:44; II Chron. 20:35.)</i> the Lord will destroy your work.” [Similarly,] because they made an alliance with this wicked king to pass through his land, they lost this righteous man (i.e., Aaron). For that reason the death of Aaron<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. 20:28: … AND AARON DIED THERE ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.</i> is made [immediately] adjacent after the <i>parashah</i> about the king of Edom. (Numb. 20:21-22), “So Israel turned away from them. Then setting out from Kadesh, [the whole congregation of the Children of Israel came to Mount Hor]”:<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yYoma</i> 1:1 (38ab).</i> What is the meaning of “the whole congregation?” A complete congregation, a congregation which would be entering the land, since those who had come out from Egypt had died. So these were the ones of whom it is written (in Deut. 4:4), “But you who clung to the Lord your God are all alive today.” (Numb. 20:22) “Mount (<i>hr</i>) Hor (<i>hr</i>)”: What is [its] meaning? A mountain (<i>hr</i>) on top of a mountain (<i>hr</i>), like a small apple on a large apple. Even though a cloud proceeded before them which lowered the high [places] and raised up the low, the Holy One, blessed be He, left this mountain as a sample,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>deigma.</i></i> so that they would know what miracles the Holy One, blessed be He, had done for them; as He had not left a mountain in the desert, lest they become weary climbing and descending. Moreover, although the cloud had made all the desert a plain, He left an elevated spot where the tabernacle would have its resting place. He left three mountains: Mount Sinai for the Divine Presence, Mount Nebo for the burial of Moses, and Mount Hor for the burial of Aaron.
17 [This passage (Numb. 20:23-24)] teaches that the righteous are informed of the day of their death, so that they may bequeath their crown to their children. So why did Aaron not die as Miriam died, since no mortal [knew] about her [death]? It was, however, told to Moses (in Numb. 20:24), “Aaron will be gathered [unto his people].” [The situation] is comparable to a king who had two ministers of finance,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>katholikoi.</i></i> who did not act without the king's knowledge. One of them had a beautiful garment with the king, which the king needed for himself. The king said, “Although he is under my authority, I am not wearing the cloak until I inform him.” So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, say, “These two righteous men have done nothing without my knowledge. Now that I am taking them away, I shall not take them away until I inform them.” It is therefore stated (in Numb. 20:24), “Aaron will be gathered.” [Moses] said, “My Master, leave Aaron [alive and have him stay on the other side of the Jordan] with the Children of Reuben and the Children of Gad.” He said to him (in Numb. 20:24, cont.), “’Which I have given to the Children of Israel,’ his death is required for the giving of the Land of Israel. Do you want him not to die and they not come into the Land of Israel?” Hence it is written (in Numb. 20:24), “which I have given to the Children of Israel.”
18 (Numb. 20:24, cont.) “Because you rebelled against My command”: This text is related (to Prov. 10:3), “The Lord will not let a righteous soul go hungry.” This refers to the first Adam, in that none of the righteous, who stem from him and upon whom has been decreed sentence of death, will pass away until they see the face of the Divine Presence and reprove the first Adam, and say to him, “You have caused us death.” But he will answer them, “I have [only] one sin on my hands; but in your case; is there a single one of you that does not have more than four offenses on his hands?” So where is it shown that the righteous see the face of the Divine Presence? Where it is stated (in Is. 38:11), “I said, ‘I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living [...].’” The righteous shall be punished with death on account of small transgressions, so that the first Adam will not be blamed on their account. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 10:3), “The Lord will not let a righteous soul go hungry.” It is therefore stated (in Numb. 20:24), “because you rebelled against My command.”
19 (Numb. 20:25-26) “Take Aaron [and his son Elazar] […,] And strip [Aaron]”: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to [Moses], “See, you may console him that he is bequeathing his crown to his sons. [This is] something that you are not bequeathing to your [own] children.” (Numb. 20:28): “So Moses stripped Aaron of his vestments and put them [on his son Elazar].” But if the high priest leaves the Temple mount in priestly vestments, does he not receive forty lashes, since [these vestments] are [made of] wool and flax?<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 22:11, which forbids the mixture, and <i>Kil.</i> 9:1, which allows robes of this mixture for priests when they minister in the Temple. Cf. also <i>Yoma</i> 72a, according to which the forty lashes are for one who tears a priestly garment.</i> However, [Scripture serves] to inform you that, with the wording by which he inducted him into the priesthood, when [the Holy One, blessed be He,] said to [Moses] (in Lev. 8:2), “Take Aaron,” with this very wording He also said to him (in Numb. 20:25), “Take Aaron.” (Numb. 20:27) “So Moses did as the Lord commanded”: [This verse serves] to teach you that, even though He had spoken a decree against Aaron, he did not hesitate. 
20 (Numb. 20:29) “Then all the congregation saw that Aaron had died”: When Moses and Elazar came down [from the mountain], the whole congregation assembled themselves against them and said, “Where is Aaron?” They said to them, “He is dead.” They said to them, “How could the angel of death hurt him, a man who has halted the angel of death and held him back?” It is so stated (in Numb. 17:13), “So he (i.e., Aaron) stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was halted.” They said to them, “If you bring him [back], well and good; but if not, we will stone you [to death].” At that time Moses rose in prayer. He said, “Master of the world, bring us out from [this] suspicion.” Immediately the Holy One, blessed be He, opened the [burial] cave and showed him to [the congregation] for them. It is so stated (in Numb. 20:29), “Then all the congregation saw that Aaron had died.” What is written after this (in Numb. 21:1)? “When the Canaanite king of Arad, [who dwelt in the Negeb], heard.” You find that once Aaron died, the clouds of glory withdrew, and they appeared like an unkempt woman. And who was this king of Arad? This [was Amalek, since it is stated (in Numb. 13:29), “Amalek dwells in the land of the Negeb […].” Now he dwelt in the gap (in the border), and when he heard that Aaron was dead and that the clouds of glory had departed, he immediately engaged them in battle. (Numb. 21:1, cont.) “By way of Atharim (a place name interpreted as coming from <i>twr</i>),”<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">The actual root is ’<i>TR</i>.</i> [meaning] the great scout (rt.: <i>twr</i>) that had scouted (rt.: <i>twr</i>) the way for them. It is so stated (in Numb. 10:33), “and the ark of the covenant of the Lord traveled ahead of them [three days' journey to seek (rt.: <i>twr</i>) out a resting place for them].” (Numb. 21:1, cont.) “He fought against Israel”: If that was Amalek, why did [Scripture] call him a Canaanite? Because Israel was forbidden to fight with the children of Esau, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 2:5), “Do not engage them in battle [...].” When Amalek came and engaged in battle with them a second time, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “This [nation] is not forbidden like the children of Esau. Just look. They are like Canaanites, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 20:17), ‘Rather you shall utterly destroy them, [the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites].’” For that reason he was called a Canaanite. From time immemorial Amalek has been a strap for the punishment of Israel. You find that when they said (in Exod. 17:7), “Is the Lord amongst us or not,” immediately (in Exod. 17:8), “And Amalek came.” [And also (in Numb. 14:4),] “And they said – one man to his brother – let us appoint a head and return to Egypt,” [is followed by (Numb. 14:45),] “And the Amalekites and the Canaanites [...] came down [and dealt them a shattering blow at Hormah].” And here (in Numb. 20:29,) “Then all the congregation saw that Aaron had died,” [is followed by (Numb 21:1),] “When the Canaanite, king of Arad heard.” You find that, when Aaron died, Amalek went out against them; and Israel retreated back seven stages [of their journey]. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 10:6), “Then from the wells of Bene-Jaakan the Children of Israel journeyed to Moserah; there Aaron died.” Did Aaron die there? Did he not die on Mount Hor, as stated (in Numb. 20:28) “and Aaron died there on Mount Hor?”<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yYoma</i> 1:1 (38ab); <i>ySot.</i> 1:10 (17d); cf. <i>Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael</i>, <i>Wayassa</i>‘ 1, on Exod. 15:22.</i> And [so] the verses are evidence of seven stages backwards (from Mount Hor to Moserah) to teach you that [Israel] had retreated.
21 (Numb. 21:4) “Then they journeyed from Mount Hor [by way of the Reed Sea in order to go around the Land of Edom], but the people grew restive on the journey.” But is it not written (of that era in Neh. 9:20), “And You gave Your good spirit to enlighten them?” It is simply that those remnants of Israel which had come out of Egypt over whom death had been decreed, saw neither a peaceful nor agreeable spirit in the desert. Thus it says (in Numb. 14:33), “And your children shall roam in the wilderness....” This was (according to Numb. 21:4,) the people who grew restive on the journey. (Numb. 21:5) “And the people spoke against God and against Moses”: They equated the slave and his Master. (Numb. 21:5) “Our soul loathes this miserable food,” for that generation was unable to taste any of the fruits of the land at all. R. Aqiva said, “When merchants [even] uncovered a basket with some fruits of the land for them, they died.” It is so stated (in Deut. 1:35), “Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land,” [i.e.,] any good that comes because of the land. That is why the people grew restive on the journey. These are the ones that grumbled (in Numb. 21:5), “Our soul loathes.” 
22 (Numb. 21:6) “Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people”: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, see fit to exact retribution from them through serpents? It is simply that the snake started [the use of] slanderous language at the beginning and was cursed; yet they did not learn from this. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Let the serpent, which was the first [to use] slanderous language, come and exact retribution from those who [still] speak slanderous language.” This is what is written (in Eccl. 10:8), “the one who breaks through a barrier will have a snake bite him.” Another interpretation of why retribution was exacted from them through serpents: Even if the serpent eats all the luxury foods of the world, for him they are turned to dust in his mouth. Thus it is stated (in Is. 65:25), “but the serpent's food shall be dust.” Now these people ate the manna, as stated (in Ps. 106:15), “So He gave them what they asked for.” It also says (in Deut. 2:7), “these forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.”<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., no luxury foods.</i> Let a serpent that eats many species and has [but] one taste in his mouth come and exact the retribution from those who eat one species and taste many species. (Numb. 21:6) “Fiery serpents (<i>serafim</i>)\;” [They are called <i>serafim</i>] because they burn (<i>sorefim</i>) the soul. R. Judan says, “[God] sent out the [same] serpents that the cloud of glory would burn and make into a fence for the camp to let them know the miracles that the Omnipresent had done for them.” They were the ones that attacked them.
23 (Numb. 21:7) “Then the people came unto Moses and said, ‘We have sinned’”: [They] knew that they had spoken against Moses, so they fell prostrate before him and said (ibid., cont.), “pray unto the Lord to remove [the serpent]<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The use of the singular here may be suggesting to midrashic interpreter that this was the same serpent that sinned in the Garden of Eden.</i> from us….” There was one serpent. [(Ibid., cont.) “And he prayed”: The passage serves] to make Moses' humility known to you, in that he did not hesitate to seek mercy for them. And [it is also] to make the power of repentance known to you. As soon as they said, “We have sinned,” he was immediately reconciled to them. [The passage serves] to teach you that the one who forgives should not be cruel. And so too does it say (in Gen. 20:17), “Abraham then prayed to God, and God healed [Abimelech and his wife].” And so does it say (in Job 42:10), “The Lord restored Job’s fortunes when he prayed on behalf of his friends.” And where is it shown that if one has sinned against his companion and says to him, “I have sinned,” without [the companion] forgiving him, that [the unforgiving one] is called a sinner? Where it is stated (in I Sam. 12:23), “As for me also, far be it for me to sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray on your behalf.” When? When they came and said to him, “We have sinned,” [as stated] (in I Sam. 12:10), “and [they] said, ‘We have sinned […].’” And he answered, “Far be it from me to sin.” (Numb. 21:8), “And the Lord said unto Moses, ‘Make a fiery serpent, [and put it on a pole]; then it shall come to pass that, when anyone bitten [looks at it, he shall live],” not only one bitten by a serpent, but anyone bitten, even one bitten by an adder, by a scorpion, a wild beast, or a dog. (Numb. 21:9) “So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it up by a miracle”:<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nes.</i> The usual rendering would read: AND SET IT UP ON A POLE (<i>nes</i>). However, since <i>nes</i> can also mean “miracle,” the midrash is understanding it in the latter sense.</i> He tossed it into the air and it remained there. 
24 (Numb. 21:10) “Then the Children of Israel journeyed on and camped in Oboth (<i>Ovot,</i> rt: '<i>wb</i>),” because they had become enemies (<i>oyevim,</i> rt: '<i>yb</i>) to the Omnipresent. (Numb. 21:11) “And they camped at Iye-Abarim ('<i>avarim,</i> rt.: '<i>br</i>),” because they were full of transgressions ('<i>averot,</i> rt.: '<i>br</i>). (Numb. 21:12) “And they camped in the Wadi Zered,” because the wadi was [only] about a full span (<i>zeret</i>) [in width]; but they were unable to cross it for thirty-eight years. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 2:13-14), “Now then arise and cross the Wadi Zered. And the time that we traveled from Kadesh-Barnea until we crossed the Wadi Zered was thirty-eight years.”(Numb. 21:13) “From there they journeyed and camped on the other side of (<i>m'br</i>) the Arnon (rt.: <i>rnn</i>),” because the Omnipresent was reconciled to them.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The argument seems to depend on the following: <i>M‘BR</i> is close to <i>M‘BRH</i>, which means, “away from transgression” or, with different voweling, “away from wrath”; while the root, <i>RNN,</i> means “sing” or “rejoice.”</i>
25 (Numb. 21:17) “Then Israel sang this song”: This song (of the well) was uttered at the end of forty [years], while the well was given to them at the beginning of the forty [years]? So what was the purpose of writing [it down] here? This matter has been explained from what is above (in vs. 14), “It is therefore said in the book of the wars of the Lord, ‘'<i>t<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">This untranslated word is used here to indicate a direct object, but it also means “sign.”</i></i> Waheb [in Suphah (<i>Sufah</i>) and '<i>t</i> the Wadis of the Arnon].’” What is this? That the Holy One blessed be He did for them signs ('<i>twt</i>, singular: '<i>t</i>) and miracles in the Arnon Wadis like the miracles which He did for them in the Reed (<i>suf</i>) Sea. And what were the miracles in the Arnon Wadis? One would stand on one mountain and speak with his companion on the other mountain; yet he was seven <i>mil</i><sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Milim</i>. Lat.: <i>milia.</i></i> away from him. Now the road descended into the middle of the wadi and then ascended, and Israel's course was to cross through the midst of the mountains. All the nations assembled endless troops there.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> Some of them took up positions in the middle of the wadi. Moreover, [the slope of] the mountain above them was riddled with caves, and facing them was a mountain which was correspondingly riddled with crags in the form of breasts (<i>shdym</i>), as stated (in Numb. 21:15), “And the slope ('<i>shd</i>) of the wadis.” The troops entered into the caves; for they said, “As soon as Israel comes down into the wadi, those ahead of them who are in the wadi and those in the caves will arise and kill all of them. When Israel did arrive at that place, [the Holy One, blessed be He,] did not make it necessary for them to go down into the wadi. Instead, He gave a signal to the mountains, and the [craggy] breasts of the latter mountain entered the caves, so that they all died. Moreover, the mountains brought their summits so close to each other that they became a highway, for there was no knowing [where] each [mountain] joined its neighbor. Furthermore, that wadi separates the borders between the Land of Israel and the Land of Moab, as stated (in Numb. 21:13 = Jud. 11:18), “For the Arnon is the border of Moab […].” The mountain in the Land of Moab, the one with the caves, was [not] shaken; but the mountain in the Land of Israel, the one with the crags in the form of breasts, was shaken and joined to the mountain opposite. Why was the one in the Land of Israel shaken? The matter is comparable to a female slave who saw her master's son coming to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">In this illustration the female slave is the mountain, the master is God, and the son is Israel.</i> She jumped up to greet him and welcome him. The crags entered into the caves and all those warriors were crushed. Then the well descended to the wadi, where it became a mighty [torrent] and destroyed the troops, just as the [Reed] Sea had destroyed those [Egyptians]. Scripture therefore compared (in Numb. 21:14), “Waheb in Suphah (<i>Sufah</i>) and the Wadis of the Arnon.”<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that WAHEB IN SUPHAH (understood as <i>Yam Suf,</i> or Reed Sea) is mentioned next to the Wadi Arnon shows that the two deliverances are comparable.</i> When Israel crossed upon those mountains without knowing about all these miracles the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Behold, I will let My Children know how many troops I destroyed because of them.” [So] the well descended into the caves and brought out innumerable skulls, arms, and legs. Thus when Israel returned to seek the well, they saw it coming out powerfully from the wadi, as it discharged the limbs [of the troops]. And where is it shown that the well informed [Israel] about them? Where it is stated (in Numb. 21:15-16), “And the slope of the wadis…. And from there they continued to Be’er (the well).” But was [the well] with them from there; was it not with them from the beginning of the forty years? It is simply that it had gone down to inform about the miracles, while Israel remained at the wadis and said to it (in Numb. 21:17, cont.,) “Rise up, O well, sing to it.” And they sang a song about them.
26 (Numb. 21:17) “Then Israel sang.” For what reason is Moses not mentioned there? For the reason that he was being punished because of the waters; and no person praises<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>QLS</i>. Cf.: Gk.: <i>kalos</i>.</i> his executioner.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>speculator</i> (“<i>examiner</i>” <i>or</i> “<i>overseer</i>”).</i> And why is the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, not mentioned there? The matter is comparable to a governor who made a banquet for the king. The king said, “Will my friend be there?” They told him, “No.” He said, “[Then] I also am not going there.” Also here the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Inasmuch as Moses is not mentioned, I also will not be mentioned there.” (Numb. 21:18) “The well that the princes dug […]:” Was it dug there? It is simply that it was given through the merit of the ancestors who were called princes. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 105:41-42), “He opened a rock, and water gushed out […]. For he remembered His holy promise and His servant Abraham.” (Numb. 21:18, cont.) “That the nobles of the people dug with the scepter, even with their own staffs”: The princes were standing by it, and each and every one drew [the water] with his own staff for his own tribe and for his own family. And the space between the [four] standards was filled with a [flow of] water that was gathering strength. A woman who had to go to her companion from one standard to [another] standard went by ship, as stated (in Ps. 105:41), “they traveled the river by <i>tsiyyot</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">A more traditional translation would be: IT FLOWED THROUGH THE WILDERNESS LIKE A RIVER.</i> Now <i>tsiyyot</i> (here understood as the plural of <i>tsi</i>) can only denote a ship, since it is stated (in Is. 33:21), “nor shall a stately ship (<i>tsi</i>) pass by.” Now the waters flowed outside the camp and embraced a great strip of land. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 23:3) “He leads me in paths (literally, circles) of righteousness.” In addition, [the encircling waters] would cause endless varieties of green herbage and trees to grow, as stated (in Ps. 23:2), “He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still water].” All those days that Israel was in the desert they used it (i.e., the well). Therefore, they rendered praise for it [with the song ending] (in Numb. 21:18), “the well that the princes dug.” (Numb. 21:18, cont.) “From Midbar (literally, desert) to Mattanah,” [so stated] because in the desert [the well] was given (<i>nittenah</i>) them to use as a gift (<i>mattanah</i>). Another interpretation: Why was [the well] given in the desert? Because if it had been given to them in the land, the tribe in whose border it was given would have argued and said, “I have a prior claim to it.” For that reason it was given in the desert where all would have an equal claim to it. And for what other reason was it given in the desert? Just as a desert is neither sown nor cultivated, so is the one who receives the words of Torah. They remove from him the yoke of the government and the yoke of earning a living. Just as a desert does not grow <i>arnona</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The Latin word generally denotes, as it probably does here, a tax on farm goods paid in kind; but the word also occurs in a broader sense denoting agricultural products generally.</i> so are children of Torah (i.e., Torah scholars) free [from it] in this world.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., by accepting the yoke of Torah, such scholars are exempt from government taxes and the need to earn a living.</i> Another interpretation [of why it was given] in the desert: Who is the one who fulfills the Torah? One who makes himself like a desert and removes himself from everything [that might distract him]. (Numb. 21:19) “From Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth”: These three places correspond to the three courts in Jerusalem that would explicate the Torah to all of Israel: (Ibid.) “From Mattanah to Nahaliel,” these refer to the Sanhedrin on the Temple Mount; (ibid., cont.) “from Nahaliel to Bamoth,” these refer to the Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>synhedrion.</i></i> in the [Temple] court beside the altar; (Numb. 21:20) “From Bamoth to the valley that is in the Plain of Moab.” These refer to the Sanhedrin, when it was in the chamber of hewn stones, which was in the region of Ruth, of whom it is stated (in Ruth 2:6), “She is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the Plains of Moab.” (Numb. 21:20, cont.) “[At the Summit of Pisgah,] which is visible on the surface of wilderness (<i>yeshimon</i>);”<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yeshimon</i> may be a place name, Jeshimon.</i> This is in reference to the well which accompanied them until it was hidden in the Sea of Tiberias.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>yKil.</i> 2:4 or 3 (32cd); <i>yKet.</i> 12:3 (35b); Lev. R. 22:4; Eccl. R. 5:8-9:5; cf. <i>Shab.</i> 35b, according to which the well is visible from Mount Carmel; similarly M. Ps. 24:6, according to which the well is visible from Mount Nebo.</i> And one standing on the surface of the wilderness sees something in the midst of the sea about the size of the mouth of an oven; and that is the well, which is visible on the surface of the wilderness.
27 (Numb. 21:21) “Then Israel sent messengers [to Sihon …]”: This text is related (to Ps. 37:3), “Trust in the Lord and do good, abide in the land and remain loyal.” And it states (in Ps. 34:15), “Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.” The Torah did not command [them] to go in pursuit of the commandments. Rather [it states] (in Deut. 22:6), “When you come on a bird's nest”; (in Exod. 23:4) “When you encounter [the ox of one who hates you]”; (in Exod. 23:5) “When you see the donkey [of one who hates you]”; (in Deut. 24:20) “when you beat your olive tree”; (in Deut. 24:21), “When you gather the grapes of your vineyard”; and (in Deut. 23:25) “When you go into your neighbor's vineyard.” If [these situations] present themselves to you, you are given a command concerning them; but [you are] not to go in pursuit of them. In the case of peace, however, (according to Ps. 34:15), “seek peace,” wherever you are; “and pursue it,” wherever else it may be. And this is what Israel did. Although the Holy One, blessed be He, had said to them (in Deut. 2:24), “begin to take possession, and engage him in battle,” they went in pursuit of peace. So is it stated (in Numb. 21:21) “Then Israel sent messengers….”
28 (Numb. 21:21) “Then Israel sent messengers”: All the words of Torah are necessary to each other, for what one covers over the other opens up. It is stated here (in Numb. 21:21), “Then Israel sent [messengers],” while in another place [Scripture] ascribes the sending to Moses. [Thus] it is stated (in Deut. 2:26), “Then I sent messengers from the Desert of Kedemoth [unto King Sihon of Heshbon with words of peace].” It is written (in Jud. 11:17), “And Israel sent messengers to the King of Edom.” [Yet] it is written (in Numb. 20:14), “Moses sent from Kadesh messengers to the king of Edom […].” These verses require one another, as Moses is Israel and Israel is Moses. [This comes] to teach you that the head of a generation is surely equivalent to the whole generation. 
29 (Numb. 20:17) “Please let us pass through your land.”<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">As Buber suggests in note 370, the citation is probably a misreading for Numb. 20:22: LET ME PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND. This alternate reading better fits the context.</i> As he had sent to inform the king of Edom that he would do no damage to him, so did he send to this one. (Deut. 2:28) “You shall sell me food for money, and water with money….”: It is customary for water to be given gratis, but I am giving payment for it. (Numb. 21:22) “We will go by the king's highway [until we have passed through your territory]”: But in another place it is written (in Deut. 2:29), “until I have crossed [the Jordan].” To what is the matter comparable? To one guarding a vine or fig tree. When someone comes and says, “Let me pass through here, so that I may gather grapes from the vineyard,” he says to him, “It is only because of you that I am sitting on guard, and you would come to gather [the grapes]?” So it was with Sihon. He received wages from all the kings of Canaan; and they would bring taxes up to him, for he would crown them. Moreover he and Og were considered the equivalent of them all, since it is stated (in Ps. 136:19-20), “Sihon, king of the Amorites…; and Og, king of Bashan, and all the royalty of Canaan.” Israel said to [Sihon], “Let us pass through your land<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">“Let us pass through your land” is similar but not quite equal to either Numb. 20:17 or Numb. 21:22.</i> to conquer the kings.” He said to them, “I am sitting here to guard them from you.” (Numb. 21:23) “So Sihon did not allow Israel to cross on his territory; instead Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel”: The Holy One, blessed be He, only did this to deliver him into their hand without trouble. As it is written (in Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2), “to Sihon, king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon (i.e., with calculation).”<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">The stress on the Holy One acting with fore-thought was suggested by the words, IN HESHBON, which can also be translated WITH CALCULATION.</i> If Heshbon had been full of mosquitos, no mortal could have conquered it; and if Sihon had been in a valley, no mortal could have overpowered him. And it goes without saying [that it could not be conquered], since he was a warrior and dwelt in a fortified city. [Ergo,] (in Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2), “who dwelt in Heshbon.” If he and his troops<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> had dwelt [scattered about] in his towns, Israel would have worn themselves out to prevail against him and conquer each and every town. Instead the Holy One, blessed be He, gathered them together so as to deliver them into their hand without trouble. And so it said (in Deut. 2:31), “See I have begun to give Sihon [and his land] over to you.” They killed all his warriors who had come out against them. Then they returned for the women and infants without exertion. It is therefore written (in Numb. 21:23,25), “Sihon gathered all his people together […]. And Israel took all of these cites.”
30 (Numb. 21:26) “For Heshbon was a city of Sihon”: This text is related (to Is. 61:8), “Because I the Lord love justice.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in Deut. 2:9), “Do not trouble Moab.” Now Heshbon had been part of Moab, since it is stated (in Numb. 21:26), “For Heshbon was a city of Sihon king of the Amorites, etc.” When Israel came, they took Heshbon, which belonged to Sihon and whatever [else] he had taken from the king of Moab. For if they had taken it from him [directly], they would have had major robbery on their hands. Instead Sihon took it from Moab, and Israel took it from Sihon. Thus they were acquitted from [the charge of] robbery. Therefore it is written (in Numb. 21:26), “For Heshbon was a city of Sihon.” (Numb. 21:27) “Therefore those who speak in parables say”: This refers to Balaam and his father, whom Sihon had hired to curse Moab. And it was they who had said (Numbers 21:27-8), “[Come to Heshbon,] let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established. For a fire has come forth from Heshbon, [a flame from the city of Sihon]. It has devoured Ar of Moab.” Thus they cursed Moab so that they might deliver [it] into [Sihon's] hand. (Numb. 21:29) “Woe be to you, O Moab.” 
31 (Numb. 21:31) Thus Israel dwelt in all the cities [in the land of] the Amorites”: [Only] Jazer survived. &gt; (Numb. 21:32) “So Moses sent to spy out Jazer”: These spies were zealous. They said, “We have confidence in the prayer of Moses. [Yet] he has already sent messengers [that were] spies in the past and they brought a catastrophe. But we shall not do so. Rather, we will trust in the Holy One, blessed be He, and make war.” They then did so and slew the Amorites who were in [the city]. 
32 (Numb. 21:33) “Then they turned and went up”: Some say, “The wars of Sihon took place in Elul. Then they celebrated the festival in Tishri, then after the festival came the war with Og. Just as you say [with regard to the festival of Passover] (in Deut. 16:7), ‘and in the morning you shall turn to your tents.’” (Numb. 21:33, cont.) “And Og king of Bashan came out against them, [he and all his people],” for the Holy One, blessed be He, had gathered them [all] before [Israel] in order to deliver [Og and his people] into their hand. (Numb. 21:34) “But the Lord God said unto Moses, ‘Do not fear him’”: This text is related (to Prov. 28:14), “Fortunate is the one who is always afraid […].” Such is the nature of the righteous. Although the Holy One, blessed be He, assures them, they do not cast off fear. And so it is written about Jacob (in Gen. 32:8]), “And Jacob was [greatly] afraid.” Why was he afraid? He said, “Perhaps I was tainted by something at Laban's,” since it is written (in Deut. 23:15), “so [the Lord] is not to see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.” Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, may have forsaken me. Moses also acquired fear in the manner of his ancestor. Why was he afraid? He said, “Perhaps Israel sinned in the war with Sihon or became tainted by a transgression.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Numb. 34:21), “’Do not fear,’ as they all fulfilled [their actions] with justice. ‘Do not fear him,’ [even though] a warrior more formidable than himself has never arisen in the world [since his time].” Thus it is stated (in Deut. 3:11), “For only Og King of Bashan was left over from the remaining Rephaim.”<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">According to Deut. 2:11, 20-21, together with Numb. 13:33, the Rephaim were a race of giants.</i> Now he had been left from the warriors whom Amraphel and his colleagues (Gen. 14:1, 9) had slain, as stated (in Gen. 14:5), “and they smote the Rephaim […].” But this [man] was their refuse, like olive pits that come out as survivors from the bottom of the oil press. It is so stated (in Gen. 14:13), “Then the survivor came and told Abram (about Lot's capture) […].” This was Og. And here [Scripture] made him into leftovers, as stated (in Josh. 13:12), “he was left over from the remaining Rephaim.” It was his intention that Abraham would go out [to war] and be killed. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave him a reward for [what] his feet had earned [for the good that ended up resulting]; in that he lived all those years until he fell at the hand of [Abraham's] children. When Moses came to wage war with him, he was afraid of him. He said, “I am a hundred and twenty years old, while he is five hundred years old.” If he did not have merit, he would not have lived all these years. The Holy One, blessed be He, said (in Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2) “’Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand,’ you with your hand shall kill him, (Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2, cont.) ‘and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon….’” (Deut. 3:6) “And we shall utterly destroy them”: But is it not written (in Deut. 3:7), “But all the cattle and the booty of the towns we took as booty for ourselves?” It is simply that they utterly destroyed their bodies, so as not to benefit from any of them at all. (Numb. 21:35) “So they smote him and his sons”: The written text (<i>ketiv</i>) [reads] “his son,”<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. a similar verse about Sihon, Deut. 2:33, where HIS SON is the undoubted reading.</i> because he had a son more formidable than himself. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “In this world you destroy the nations little by little, but in the world to come, I will remove them from the world at a single stroke. It is so stated (in Is. 33:12), “And the people shall become burnings of lime, thorns cut down that are burned in the fire.”

Chapter 20

1 (Numb. 22:2) “Now Balak [ben Zippor] saw (rt.: <i>r'h</i>)”: This text is related (to Deut. 32:4), “The Rock, His work is perfect, because all His ways are justice.” The Holy One, blessed be He, did [not] leave the nations of the world a pretext for saying in the future to come, “You alienated us and did not give us anything like what You gave Israel in this world.” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? Just as He raised up kings, sages and prophets for Israel, so did He raise them up from the nations of the world. He raised up Solomon as king over all the earth, and he did the same for Nebuchadnezzar, as stated (Jer. 27:6), “I even give him the wild beasts to serve him.” The [former] built the holy Temple and said many praises and supplications; and the latter destroyed it and cursed and blasphemed, and said (in Is. 14:14), “I will go up to high places of the clouds, I will resemble the Most High.” He gave David wealth, and he acquired the House for His name.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 30:1 [introduction]: a song at the dedication of the house (i.e., the Temple) of David. The Temple was David’s in that he acquired the materials to build it.</i> He gave wealth to Haman, and he acquired a whole nation for slaughter. Every dignity Israel received, you find that the nations of the world [also] received. In like manner He raised up Moses for Israel, and Balaam for the nations of the world. Look at (rt.: <i>r'h</i>) what a difference there is between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world! The prophets of Israel warn Israel about transgressions, and so it says (in Ezek. 33:7), “Now, son of man, I have appointed you a watchman, etc.” But the prophet who He raised from the nations established a breach to cut off mortals from the world. And not only that, but all the prophets had a merciful attitude towards both Israel and the nations of the world; for so did Jeremiah say (in Is. 16:11), “Therefore my heart moans like a flute for Moab….” And similarly has Ezekiel said (in Ezek. 27:2), “Son of man, ‘raise up a dirge over Tyre.’” But this cruel man rose up to uproot a whole nation without cause, for nothing. Therefore the <i>parashah</i> about Balaam was written to make known why the Holy One, blessed be He, removed the holy spirit from the nations of the world. [It was] because He raised this man out of the nations of the world, and look (rt.: r'h) at what he did!
2 (Numb. 22:2) “Now Balak ben Zippor saw”: What is the meaning of “Now he saw?” He saw retribution which would come against Israel from all their enemies, [and that] all of the [others] came with wars and subjugation which they could withstand. But this one was like a man who could extract a word from his mouth to uproot an entire nation. (Numb. 22:2) “Now Balak [ben Zippor] saw:” It would have been better for the wicked if they had been blind, for their eyes bring a curse to the world. With reference to the generation of the flood, it is written (in Gen. 6:2), “The sons of God saw [how beautiful the human daughters were and took whomever they chose as their wives].” It is also written (in Gen. 9:22), “Then Ham, the father of Canaan, saw [the nakedness of his father and told his two brothers outside].” It is also written (in Gen. 12:15), “So Pharaoh's courtiers saw her (i.e., Abram's wife Sarah) [and praised her to Pharaoh, and the woman was taken to Pharaoh's house].” And similarly with all of them. So also [here] (in Numb. 22:2), “Now Balak [ben Zippor] saw.” (Numb. 22:2) “Now Balak ben Zippor saw”: The matter is comparable to someone who appointed guards to guard from an invader; and he had confidence in them, because they were warriors. When the invader came over and killed them, he trembled with fear for himself. It was the same also with Balak. When he saw what happened with Sihon and Og to whom he had been sending payment to guard him, he was afraid for himself. And in addition to that, he had seen the miracles at the Wadis of Arnon.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to Numb. 21:26-31, Sihon defeated the King of Moab and captured his territory as far at the Arnon. See Numb. R. 19:25, for a description of the miracles. See also Numb. R. 20:7, according to which Sihon’s victory resulted from a curse by Balaam.</i> 
3 (Numb. 22:3) <i>“Wayyagor mo'av</i>”:<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A traditional translation of these words would be NOW MOAB WAS IN GREAT DREAD, or something similar.</i> What is the meaning of <i>“Wayyagor</i> (rt.: <i>ygr</i>)?” When Israel appeared to the Ammonites, they appeared clothed for peace. But when they appeared to the Moabites they appeared armed [for battle]. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 2:19), “When you draw near the frontier of the Children of Ammon, do not trouble them.” It is written [to imply not to trouble them] with all kinds of trouble; (ibid., cont.) “and do not provoke (rt.: <i>grh</i>) them,” with any kind of provocation. In regard to Moab, however, He said (in Deut. 2:9), “Do not trouble Moab, and do not provoke (rt.: <i>grh</i>) them with war.” Do not make war with them, but whatever you can seize apart from [war], seize. For that reason they appeared armed, and [the Moabites] gathered themselves (rt.: '<i>gr</i>) to their cities, as stated (in Numb. 22:3), “Now Moab <i>yagor</i> (i.e., gathered).” <i>Wayyagor</i> (rt.: <i>ygr</i>, here understood a form of '<i>gr</i>) can only be a word for a gathering, just as it says (in Prov. 10:5), “A prudent child gathers (rt.: '<i>gr</i>) in the summer.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 22:3), “<i>wayyagor”</i>: It is an expression meaning stranger (<i>ger</i>). As they saw themselves as strangers in the world: They said, “They went down to Egypt to sojourn, and they seized it; and they rented houses to [the Egyptians].” It is so stated (in Exod. 3:22), “Each woman shall borrow from her neighbor and the lodger in her house.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 22:3), “<i>wayyagor”</i>: [It is] a word for fear, in that they were afraid, as they saw the whole land in the hands of Israel. As Sihon had come and taken [part of] the land of Moab, as stated (Numb. 21:26), “and he fought against the earlier king of Moab….” And Og had taken all of the land of the Children of Ammon, as stated (Deut. 3:11), “Since only Og was left from the remnant of the Rephaim….” [And] Israel came and took it from both of them; theft that has no iniquity. And [so the Moabites] saw their land in the hand of Israel and they would say, “Did the Holy One, blessed be He, not say (in Deuteronomy 2:9), ‘As I will not give you from its land as an inheritance’; and behold our land is in front of them (already in their possession).” Therefore they were afraid. (Numb. 22:3, cont.) “And Moab had a horror (rt.: <i>qwts</i>) [of the Children of Israel],” because they saw themselves as a [mere] thorns (qwts) over against them.
4 (Numb. 22:4) “So Moab said unto the elders of Midian”: What is the relevance of [mentioning] the elders of Midian here? It is simply that they saw Israel conquering in a way that was not customary for conquerors. They said, “Their leader (i.e., Moses) was raised in Midian. Let us learn through them what his character is like.” The elders of Midian said to them, “His power is only in his mouth.” They said to them, “We also will bring someone against them who has power in his mouth.” (Numb. 22:4) “So Moab said unto the elders of Midian”: Do you not find that the Midianites were at war with the Moabites? It is so stated (in Gen. 36:35), “[and Hadad ben Bedad,] who smote Midian in the plain of Moab, [reigned in his place].” Moreover, the hatred between them had existed from time immemorial. The matter is comparable to two dogs who were hostile to each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sifre</i>, Numb. 31:1-2 (157); <i>Sanh.</i> 105a.</i> [When] a wolf came against one of them, his companion said, “If I do not help him, [the wolf] will kill this [dog] today. [Then] tomorrow he will come against me.” Therefore Moab formed an alliance with Midian. (Numb. 22:4, cont.) “As the ox licks up [the grass of the field]”: Just as the ox has its power in its mouth, so do they have their strength in their mouth. Just as everything an ox licks up has no sign<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>semeion.</i></i> of blessing, [so] also whatever these lick up have no sign of blessing. Just as an ox gores with its horns, [so] also do these gore with their prayer, as stated (according to Deut. 33:17), “and his horns are the horns of a wild ox, [and with them he gores the nations].” (Numb. 22:4, cont.) “Now Balak ben Zippor was king of Moab at that time”: But was he not formerly a prince, as stated (in Numb. 31:8)), “Evi, Rekem, [Zur].”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">According to Enoch Zundel in his commentary, ‘<i>Ets Yosef</i>, Balak is to be identified with Zur. So also Issachar Ber Ashkenazi in his commentary, <i>Mattenot Kehunnah,</i> on Numb. R. 20:4; Louis Ginzberg, <i>The Legends of the Jews</i> (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1954), vol. III, p. 353; vol. VI, p. 136, n. 791.</i> It is simply that when Sihon was killed they made him king in his place. (Numb. 22:4, cont.) “At that time”: As it was the time that caused it for him.

7 (Numb. 22:5) “And he sent messengers to Balaam ben Beor at Pethor”: [Pethor (Petor) was] the name of his city.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh.</i> 105ab.</i> But others say that [the name implies] he was a money-changer,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Since <i>pator</i> in Aramaic denotes a table, these interpreters would read the clause: AND HE SENT MESSENGERS TO BALAAM BEN BEOR AT A MONEY-CHANGER’S TABLE. Cf. Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Gen. 23:16.</i> since the kings of the nations of the world took counsel with him, as the money-changer to whom they all would show [their coins]. Still others say that in the beginning he was an interpreter (<i>poter</i>) of dreams. He turned to being a diviner. Then he turned to the holy spirit.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. 24:2.</i> (Numb. 22:5, cont.) “To the land of his kinsfolk,” for Balak came from there, and [Balaam] had told him, “Your destiny is to become king.”(Numb. 22:5, cont.) “To summon him”: Thus he wrote him, “Do not suppose that it is for myself alone that you are doing this and that I alone am honoring you. If you uproot them, you shall receive honor from all the nations, so that the Canaanites and the Amalakites shall all bow down to you.” (Numb. 22:5, cont.) “Here is a people that has come out of Egypt:” He said to him, “As for you, how does it concern you?” He said to him (in Numb. 22:5, cont.), “’Look, they have covered the face (literally: eye) of the earth.’ [There are] two eyes upon which the land depends, Sihon and Og. They have destroyed them and covered their eyes. And [now] what do I do?” (Numb. 22:5, cont.) “Now they are dwelling opposite me (<i>mmwly</i>)”: [What is actually] written [in the Biblical text] is <i>mmly</i> (from the root, <i>mwl,</i> which means, "cut off"), just as it says (in Ps. 118:10), “in the name of the Lord I will cut them off (rt.: <i>mwl</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">With the word rewritten in this sense, the end of Numb. 22:5 reads: NOW THEY ARE DWELLING [THERE] CUTTING ME OFF. This interpretation of Numb. 22:5 is also given by Rashi, ad loc.</i> (Numb. 22:6) “So come now please, curse (<i>arah</i>) [this people] for me”: What is the meaning of “curse ('<i>rh</i>) […] for me?” Perhaps I shall be able to control them little by little, like someone who picks (rt.: '<i>rh</i>) figs. (Numb. 22:6, cont.) “For they are mightier than I”: [It is] not that they are more valiant than I, nor [is it] that their forces are numerous. It is simply that they conquer through their mouth, [and this is] something that I cannot do. (Numb. 22:6, cont.) “Perhaps I shall be able to smite them”: What reason was there for this one to engage them (i.e., Israel) in war? Did not the Holy One, blessed be He, tell them this, that [Israel] was not to take any of their land? [It was] simply that [Balak] was more of a master of sorceries and divinations than Balaam, for it is so written of him (in Numb. 22:2), “Now Balak [ben Zippor] saw (in a vision),” except that he did not really comprehend the things [he saw]. And so it says (in Is. 47:13-14), “You are wearied with your many deliberations; let those who study the heavens please stand up and save you, those who gaze at the stars.” When he saw that Israel would fall into his hand, he therefore gave his daughter over (to prostitution to lure Israel to sin);<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">See Numb. 25:1-15. Numb. 25:15 specifically identifies the sacred prostitute Cozbi as the daughter of Zur, whom the midrash (above, section 7:4) has already identified with Balak.</i> and through her, twenty-four thousand fell. To this end he would have engaged them in war, but he did not know how. Hence (as in Numb. 22:6), “Perhaps I shall be able to smite (<i>nkh</i>) them”: As one discounts (rt.: <i>nkh</i>) one twenty-fourth of a [<i>se’ah</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">On allowing a given species to have up to 1/24 of another species, see <i>Kil.</i> 2:1; <i>yKil</i>. 2:1 (27c); <i>BB</i> 6:2; <i>BB</i> 93b-94a, where as elsewhere a <i>rova</i>‘ is a quarter of a <i>qav</i>, which in turn is one sixth of a <i>se’ah.</i> Thus one <i>rova</i>’ equals one twenty-fourth of a <i>se’ah.</i></i> so also did twenty-four thousand fall from Israel there, [which is] one less.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">24 x 20,000 = 480,000, and 24 x 5,000 = 120,000, it turns out that, if 25,000 is found to be 1/24 of 600,000 and only 24,000 fell, then 1,000 are missing In a long note Buber further explains that apart from the law of mixtures, in the removal of the <i>hallah,</i> what is taken is generally 1/24 of the dough (so <i>Hal</i>. 2:7).

So the Holy One cleansed Israel by removing 1/24 of the people. However, since there were 600,000 Israelites, 25,000 (=1/24 of 600,000), not 24,000, should have been removed. The thousand extra can be explained on analogy with the law of mixtures allowing 1/24 for impurities. The first part of the interpretation in the text comes from dividing 25,000 into two parts of 20,000 + 5,000 and then multiplying each separately and adding the results, instead of simply multiplying 25,000 by 24,000. Regarding the number of Israelites in the desert, Scripture gives the 600,000 figure only in Exod. 12:37. Cf. Exod. 38:26; Numb. 1:46; 2:32, which fix the figure at 603,550 adult males excluding Levites; also Numb. 26:57, which reports a census figure of 601,730 after the removal of the 24,000 in Numb. 25:9.</i> (Numb. 22:6, cont.) “And drive them away from the land,” for he only desired to drive them away, so that they would not enter the land. (Numb. 22:6, cont.) “For I know that whomever you bless is blessed and that whomever you curse is cursed.” From where did he know? When Sihon desired to fight with Moab [and] was afraid because they were warriors, he hired Balaam and his father to curse Moab, for it says (in Numb. 21:27–29), “Therefore those who speak in parables say, [‘Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established.] For a fire has come forth from Heshbon, [a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab…]. Woe be to you, O Moab!’” Ergo it says (in Numb. 22:6), “for I know [that whomever you bless is blessed and that whomever you curse is cursed].”
8 (Numb. 22:7) “So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went with [the tools for] divination in their hand,” for they brought in their hands all kinds of divining instruments through which one divines, so as not to give him an excuse [for not coming]. So the divining instruments were in the hands of the elders of Midian, for they said, “If he comes with us, he will succeed; but if he delays [even] for an hour, he will be of no use.” As soon as they saw that he said (in vs. 8), “Lodge here tonight,” the elders of Midian went away, because they knew through their divinations that he would be of no use. 
9 (Numb. 22:9) “Then God came unto Balaam and said, ‘Who are these people with you’”: This text is related (to Prov. 28:10), “One who leads the upright astray on an evil course will fall into his own pit.” This refers to Balaam. For at first mortals [behaved] with propriety, but because of his (Balaam's) words, they became [unbridled] in sexual matters.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanh</i>. 106a.</i> Thus, of former [generations] it is stated (in Gen. 29:9), “Rachel came with the sheep.” And so (in Exod. 2:16), “Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., although these seven daughters and Rachel were shepherdesses, they had no fear of being alone among males.</i> [But] Balaam the wicked arose and led mortals astray into unchastity. But as he led [others] astray, he [himself] was led astray. By the [very] counsel he gave, he [himself] fell. So the Holy One, blessed be He, led him astray, as stated (in Job 12:23), “He exalts the nations and destroys them.” When [the Holy One, blessed be He,] asked him (in Numb. 22:9), “Who are these people with you,” that wicked one said [to himself,] “He knows nothing about them; It appears to me [that] there are times when [God] does not know. And so I can do all that I want to His children.” That is why [God] said it. In order to lead him astray. (Numb. 22:10), “And Balaam said to God, ‘Balak ben Zippor, [the king of Moab] sent [this message] unto me”: He began to boast and say, “Even though You do not honor me, and You do not put out a good name for me in the world, kings seek me. (Numb. 22:11) “Behold the people has come out of Egypt […]; come now, curse (<i>qavah</i>) them for me”: [This is] to make known that he (Balaam) hated Israel more than Balak, because (in Numb. 22:6) Balak did not say <i>qavah</i> (as Balaam claimed he had said in Numb. 22:11) but <i>arah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Both words mean “curse,” but the former is worse than the latter, because <i>qavah</i> involves the use of the Divine Name.</i> This one (Balaam), however, said (in vs. 11), “curse explicitly (<i>qavah</i>).”  Moreover, while the former (Balak) said (in Numb. 22:6) “And drive them away from the land,” the latter (Balaam) said [simply] (in vs. 11), “and drive them out” [i.e.,] from this world and from the world to come.
10 (Numb. 22:12) “Then God said unto Balaam, ‘You shall not go with them’”: He said to Him, “If so, I will curse them from where I am.” He said to him, (ibid., cont.) “You shall not curse the people.” He said to Him, “If so, let me bless them.” He said to him, “They do not need your blessing, (ibid., cont.) ‘for they are blessed.’” Similarly one says to a hornet, “None of your honey and none of your sting.” (Numb. 22:13) “So Balaam arose in the morning and said to the ministers of Balak”: Balaam did not tell them, “He did not give me permission to go and to curse.” [He simply said] (ibid., cont.), “To let me go with you”: He said to me, “It is not in accord with your honor to go with these people. Rather [you must go] with people greater then they,” since He takes pleasure in my being honored. Therefore (in vs. 15), “Once again Balak sent ministers, more numerous and more honorable [than (the first ones)].” (Numb. 22:17) “For I will surely honor you greatly”: [Even] more than what you [wanted] formerly will I give you. (Numb. 22:18) “But Balaam answered and said […], ‘[Even] if Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, [I could not transgress the command of the Lord my God to do less or more].’” From here you learn that he had three things. And they are an evil eye, a haughty spirit and a greedy soul:<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Avot</i> 5:19.</i> An evil eye, as it is written (in Numb. 24:2), “Then Balaam raised his eyes and saw Israel […].” A haughty spirit, as it is written (according to Numb. 22:13), “for the Lord refused to let me go with you.” A greedy soul, as it is written (according to Numb. 22:18), “[Even] if Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold.” [He said to Balak,] “If you sought to hire soldiers to fight against them, it is a question whether they would vanquish them or fail, [yet you would pay it]; is it not [then proper] that you would give it to vanquish [them with certainty]?” See you have learned that he sought this. (Ibid., cont.) “I could not transgress [the command of the Lord my God]”: [He was] prophesying that he could not annul the blessings with which the ancestors had been blessed by the mouth of the Divine Presence. (Numb. 22:19) “Now you also please stay here tonight”: What is the meaning of “you also.” That in the end you will go in disappointment like the former [messengers]. (Ibid., cont.) “So that I may know what else (rt.: <i>ysp</i>) the Lord may say to me”: Thus he prophesied that the Holy One, blessed be He, was going to multiply (rt.: <i>ysp</i>) blessings for them through him.
11 (Numb. 22:20) “Then God came unto Balaam at night”: This text is related (to Job 33:15-17), “In a dream, a vision of the night […]; Then he uncovers a human ear […]; To turn a person from an action and conceal pride from a man.” What is the meaning of “conceal from a man”? The Holy One, blessed be He, hid from him (i.e, from Balaam) that his going (with Balak's messengers) would obliterate him from the world and bring him to the grave.” [To darken (from)] (as in Job 33:30) “Bringing him back from the grave, that he may bask in the light of life,” to destroy his soul in his going. For when someone is going to sin, Satan dances before him until he completes the transgression. As soon as he has transgressed, he returns to inform Him. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 7: 22–23), “Going after her right away, he comes like an ox to the slaughter …. Until an arrow pierces his liver […].” [So] did the Holy One, blessed be He, hide [obliteration] from Balaam, until he had gone and destroyed his soul. After he had taken leave of his honor, had gone and destroyed his soul and realized how he stood, he began to beg for his soul (saying in Numb. 23:10), “let my soul die the death of the righteous.”
12 (Numb. 22:20) “Then God came unto Balaam at night”: This text is related (to Exod. 12:42), “That was for the Lord a night of vigil […].” All miracles which were done for Israel and which involved exacting retribution for them from the wicked took place at night: (Gen. 31:24) “And God came unto Laban the Aramean in a dream at night”: And it is written (in Gen. 20:3), “But God came unto Abimelech in a dream at night.” And it is written (in Exod. 12:29), “And it came to pass in the middle of the night.” And it is written (in Exod. 14:20), “there was the cloud with the darkness, and it cast a spell upon the night.” And it is written (in Gen. 14:15), “And he deployed at night.” And so [it was with] all of them. Another interpretation: Why did he reveal himself to Balaam by night? He was not worthy of [receiving] the holy spirit [except at night]. As He speaks at night with all the prophets of the nations, as stated (in Job 4:13), “In opinions from night visions.” And so Eliphaz says (in Job 4:13), “In a dream, a vision of the night,” about [Balaam’s] speaking with him at night. And similarly Elihou speaks about that which He had spoken with him at night. (Numb. 22:20, cont.) “If these men have come to invite you, arise and go with them”: From here you learn that in the way that a man wants to go, in it is he driven. As at first it was said to him (in Numb. 22:12), “Do not go with them.” As soon as he had become defiant, he went. As so is it written about him (in Numb. 22:22), “But God's anger was kindled because he was going.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I do not desire the death of the wicked. [But] in as much as you want to be obliterated from the world, ‘arise and go with them.’” (Numb. 22:20, cont.), “But only the thing [that I tell you are you to do].” [These words are] to teach you that he went with a warning. Immediately he got up early in the morning [preparing his donkey] quickly all by himself. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You wicked man! Their ancestor Abraham has already anticipated you at the binding of his son Isaac,” as stated (in Gen. 22:3), “So Abraham arose early in the morning, saddled his he-ass.” (Numb. 22:21, cont.) “And went with the princes of Moab”: [These words are] to teach you that he was as glad at the tribulation of Israel as they were. 
13 (Numb. 22:22) “But God's anger was kindled because he was going, and the angel of the Lord took a stand [in the road as his adversary (<i>satan</i>)]”:<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A good example of this Hebrew word when it is not used as a proper noun.</i> He was an angel of mercy, but to [Balaam] he had become an adversary (<i>satan</i>). (Numb. 22:22, cont.) “And two of his servant boys were with him”: This is customary for one going out on the road. It is necessary for two to attend him. Then in turn they attend each other. (Numb. 22:23) “Now the she-ass saw the angel of the Lord [and a sword was drawn in his hand]”: Was not the angel able to breathe on him and take away his spirit unless he drew his sword? And look at what is written about Sennacherib (in II Kings 19:35 = Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21.), “the angel of the Lord went out and smote [one hundred and eighty-five thousand] in the camp of Assyria.” It is also written (in Is. 40:24), “he blows on them and they wither.” However, he said to him, “[Skill with] the mouth was given to Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 27:22), ‘The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.’ And it is written (in Gen. 27:40), ‘Upon your sword shall you live.’ All the nations all live by the sword. Now you are trading off your craft and coming against them with their [craft]. I also am coming against you with your own [craft].” Hence it is written (in Numb. 22:23) “and a sword was drawn in his hand.”  
14 (Numb. 22:23) “The she-ass swerved from the road and went”: This evil one went to curse an entire nation that did not sin, and [yet] he strikes his she-ass, that it should not walk in the field.  (Numb. 22:24) “Then the angel of the Lord stood in a lane between the vineyards.” Could he not have gone after him into the field? It is simply that this is the nature of the Holy One, blessed be He. When a king of flesh and blood sends an executioner<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>speculator</i> (“examiner”).</i> to kill a particular person, he goes after him for many days, so that this person who has incurred the penalty of death [continues] eating and drinking, while the executioner goes after him from place to place. With the Holy One, blessed be He, however, it is not like that. Rather the executioner is in his place and whoever has incurred the penalty of death comes to him of his own accord. So that the angel would not be bothered with going after Balaam, he simply went ahead of him on the road. (Ibid.), “Then the angel of the Lord stood in a lane between the vineyards (<i>be’mishoel</i>)”: He said to him, “Shall the vineyards (i.e., Israel) be given over like foxes (<i>ke’shualim</i>)?” (Numb. 22:24, cont.) “With a wall on one side and a wall on the other side”: You cannot prevail against them, because in their hand (according to Exod. 32:15) are “tablets of stone, written on both their sides, on the one side and on the other side they are written.” (Numb. 22:25-26) “When the she-ass saw the angel of the Lord, she was pressed against the wall [and pressed Balaam's foot against the wall; so he struck it again]. Then the angel of the Lord moved forward again [and stood in a place so narrow that there was no room to turn aside to the right or to the left].” What reason did he have to go ahead of him three times before he revealed himself to him? He showed him here symbols of the [three] patriarchs. When he stood before him the first time, there was space on one side and on the other, [as stated] (in Numb. 22:23), “so the she-ass turned aside from the road.” On the second occasion she could only move to one side. On the third occasion (according to Numb. 22:26) “there was no room to turn aside to the right or to the left.” So what do the symbols mean? If he ever sought to curse the Children of Abraham, he would find the Children of Ishmael and the Children of Keturah on one side and on the other. [If] he sought to curse the Children of Isaac, he would find the Children of Esau on one side, and (according to Numb. 22:25) “she was pressed against the (one) wall.” In the case of the Children of Jacob, however, he found among them no residue through which to touch them. It is therefore written about the third occasion (in vs. 26), “in a narrow (<i>‘zar</i>) place.” This is Jacob, as stated (in Genesis 32:8), “Jacob was very frightened and [it] distressed (ye<i>‘zer</i>) him.”<br>(Numb. 22:26) “There was no room to turn aside to the right or to the left”: As there was no residue in any of his sons. (Numb. 22:27) “When the she-ass saw the angel of the Lord, she lay down under Balaam, [so Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the she-ass with a stick (<i>mql</i>)],” because of the shame with which she had shamed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Both the noun and verb, translated here as SHAME, come from the root, <i>BZH</i>; but the interpretation may have been suggested by a word with a similar meaning, namely <i>MQLH</i>, which means “putting to shame.” This word could have implied the relation between shame and <i>MQL</i> as used in Numb. 22:27.</i> (Numb. 22:28) “Then the Lord opened the mouth of the she-ass,” in order to make known to him that the mouth and the tongue are under His (i.e., God's) control, so that if he desired to curse, his mouth was under His control. (Ibid., cont.) “And she said to Balaam, ‘What have I done to you that you have struck me these three times (<i>shalosh regalim</i>)’”: She intimated to him, “You are seeking to uproot a people that celebrate three pilgrimage festivals (<i>shalosh regalim</i>) in the year!” (Numb. 22:29) “But Balaam said to the she-ass, ‘Because you have made a fool of me’”: Even though he spoke in the holy tongue, he had a foul tongue.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">In the words from Numb. 22:29, the word translated MADE A FOOL (a form of <i>hit‘allel</i>) sometimes has an obscene connotation, as in Jud. 19:25.</i> (Ibid., cont.) “If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now”: [The situation] is comparable to a physician who came to cure with his tongue a person bitten by a snake on the road. On the way he saw a lizard. He began searching for a stick to kill it. They said to him. “Are you unable to get this [creature] (without a stick)? How do you come to cure with your tongue a person bitten by a snake?” Similarly, the she-ass said to Balaam, “You cannot kill me unless you have a sword in your hand. How do you intend to uproot an entire people with your tongue?” He was silent and could not find an answer. The princes of Moab began to express astonishment, for they had seen a miracle the like of which had never happened in the world. Now there are some who say that he said to them, “She is not mine (and so I did not know she would cause such problems).” [The ass] answered him (in Numb. 22:30), “Am I not your she-ass upon which you have ridden all your life long until this day!” Here you learn that he was not an old man, since [the ass] was older than he. (Numb. 22:30, cont.) “Have I ever been in the habit of doing this to you?” Once she had spoken, she died, so that the people would not say, “This is the she-ass that spoke,” and make it an object of reverence. Another interpretation (of Numb. 22:30) […]: The Holy One, blessed be He, was concerned for the honor of that wicked man, lest they would say, “This is the very one through which Balaam was struck.” And if the Holy One, blessed be He, has concern for the honor of the wicked, it is not necessary to say [the same] about the honor of the righteous. And so is it stated (in Lev. 20:16), “If a woman approaches any beast to mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast,” so that [people] not say, “This is the animal for which woman x was killed.” [This is] to show how the Holy One, blessed be He is concerned about the honor of the creatures and knows their needs. And [so] He closed the mouth of the animals. As if it could speak, [people] would not be able to subdue it and master it. As this was the silliest of animals and this was the greatest of the sages. [And yet] once she spoke, he could not master her.
15 (Numb. 22:31) “Then the Lord uncovered the eyes of Balaam and he saw [the angel of the Lord….]”: Was he blind? [These words were] simply to inform him that even the eye is in [God’s] control. (Ibid., cont.) “Then he bowed down and prostrated himself on his face,” because [the angel] had spoken with him. (Numb. 22:32) “And the angel of the Lord said unto him, ‘Why did you strike your she-ass these three times’”: Did the angel come to seek [satisfaction] at his hand for the she-ass? It is simply that he said to him, “Now if for the she-ass, which has neither merit nor a covenant from the ancestors, I have been commanded to seek satisfaction from your hand, how much the more so for an entire people that has merit and the covenant of the ancestors that you have come to uproot!“ (Numb. 22:32, cont.) “Here I have come out as an adversary (<i>satan</i>), because your way is contrary (<i>yrt</i>).” [<i>Yrt</i> is interpreted as] an acronym [concerning the ass for] <i>yare'ah</i> (she feared), <i>ra'atah</i> (she saw), <i>natetah</i> (she turned away). Another interpretation: [The numerical value of] <i>yrt</i>, in the <i>atbash</i> [scheme] is [equivalent to that of] shield (<i>magen</i>). (Numb. 22:33) “For the she-ass saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away [from me, surely just now I would have killed you] and let her live”: From here you have learned that he killed the ass. (Numb. 22:34) “Then Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord, ‘I have sinned’”: As he was a crafty evildoer. He knew that nothing can withstand divine punishment except for repentance; for whenever anyone sins and says, “I have sinned,” the angel has no authority to touch him. (Ibid.) “Because I did not know; and now, if it is evil in your eyes, I will return.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This verb can also be rendered as “repent.”</i> He said to him, “I did not go until the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me (in Numb. 22:20), “Arise and go with them”; yet you are saying that I should return! [Indeed] such is His practice! Similarly, did he not tell Abraham to sacrifice his son? Then after that [it is stated (in Gen. 22:11-12)], ‘But the angel of the Lord called [unto him…]. And he said, “Do not raise your hand [against the lad].”’ He is used to saying something, then to have an angel come and reverse it. And now He had said to me, ‘Go with them,’ [but (in vs. 34)] ‘if it is evil in your eyes, I will return.’” (Numb. 22:35) “The angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, ‘Go with the men’”; for your lot is [to be] with them, and your end is to be obliterated from the world. (Ibid., cont.) “So Balaam went with the princes of Balak”: [These words] teach that just as they were happy to curse [Israel], so was he happy. 
16 (Numb. 22:36) “When Balak heard that Balaam had come.” [These words] teach that he sent messengers unto [Balak] to send him tidings. (Ibid., cont.) “He went out to meet him unto the city of Moab,” [i.e.,] unto their metropolis.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Gk. and Lat.: <i>metropolis.</i></i> What was [Balak's] reason for preceding him to the borders? He said to him, “These are borders which have been fixed from the days of Noah, so that a nation would not enter the territory of its neighbor. These [people] are coming to uproot them.” Then he showed him how they had broken through and crossed the border of Sihon and Og, as though lodging a complaint against them. (Numb. 22:37) “Then Balak said unto Balaam, ‘Did I not truly send unto you to summon you; [why did you not come unto me;] am I really unable to honor you’”: He prophesied that his end would be to go in disgrace. Then did Balaam also answer him like the [truth of the] matter (in Numb. 22:38), “So Balaam said unto Balak, ‘See, I have come unto you now, but am I really able to say anything at all?’” For I do not have authority to say what I want.
17 (Numb. 22:41, 39) “And Balak took Balaam.” “Then Balaam went unto<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic text reads both this and the following UNTO as WITH.</i> Balak, and they came unto Kiriath-Huzoth (literally: city of markets),” where he had made market places for buying and selling. He had [also] made a bazaar. [His purpose was] to show him crowds<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi</i>.</i> and say, “See what those [people] are coming to kill, people and infants who have done them no wrong.” (Numb. 22:40) “Then Balak sacrificed an ox and a sheep:”<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Bible translations usually render “OX” and “SHEEP” as plurals, but the midrash is interpreting them as singular.</i> The righteous say little and do much.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>BM</i> 87a; <i>ARN</i>, A, 13; <i>ARN</i>, B, 23; see <i>Ned</i>. 21b.</i> It is written of Abraham (in Gen. 18:5), “Let me bring a piece of bread that you may refresh your souls.” But after that (in vs. 6-7), “’Hurry up with three <i>se'ah</i> [of fine meal]….’ Then Abraham ran unto the herd.” But the wicked say a lot and do not even do a little. Balak said (in Numb. 22:17), “For I will surely honor you greatly….” When [Balaam] came, he only sent him an ox and a sheep. Balaam began gnashing his teeth at him, for he was greedy. He said [to himself], “Is this what he sent me? Tomorrow I will deliver a curse through his [own] property,” [as stated] (in Numb. 23:1), “Then Balaam said [unto Balak], ‘Build [seven altars] for me here, [and make ready for me here seven bulls and seven rams]….’” 
18 (Numb. 22:41) “So it came to pass in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal, [and from there he saw the edge of the people]”: Balak was a more of a master of divinations and auguries than Balaam, for [Balaam] was being dragged along after him like a blind man. What did the two of them resemble? Someone who had a knife in his hand but did not know [where to find] the [animal] joints, while his companion knew the joints but did not have a knife in his hand. Balak saw the places in which Israel would fall and (ibid.) “brought him up into the high places of Baal.” [This was Baal] Peor, where he saw that Israel would fall. (Numb. 23:1) “Then Balaam said unto Balak, ‘Build seven altars for me here’”: Why seven altars? [They] corresponded to seven righteous ones from Adam to Moses, who built seven altars and had been accepted: Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. Then [Balaam] said, “Why did you accept these? Was it not because of the service (the sacrifices) which they performed before you that you accepted them? Is it not [more] suitable for you to be served by seventy nations and not by [merely] one nation?” The holy spirit answered him (in Prov. 17:1), “Better a dry morsel with tranquility.” Better (in the words of Lev. 7:10) “a grain offering mixed with oil or dry” than (in Prov. 17:1) “a house full of quarrelsome feasting”;<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The words HOUSE and FEASTING can also mean “temple” and “sacrifice” respectively.</i> for you want to introduce strife between Me and Israel. (Numb. 23:2-3) “Then Balak did […] and he offered. [...]; so he went alone (rt.: <i>shph</i>)”: [Balaam’s] intent was to curse; for he had been at ease rt.: <i>shph</i>) until that moment, but from that moment on he was troubled. (Numb. 23:4) “Then God encountered Balaam”: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You evil man! What are you doing?” (Ibid., cont.) “And [Balaam] said unto him, ‘I have prepared the seven altars [and offered a ram and a bull on each altar]’:” [The matter] is comparable to a money-changer who lies about the weights. When the head of the marketplace came, he noticed him. He said to him, “What are you doing inflating and lying about the weights?” [The money changer then] said to him, “I have already sent a gift<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>doron.</i></i> to your house.” So also it was in the case of Balaam. The holy spirit cried out to him. It said to him, “You evil man! What are you doing.” He said to it (in Numb. 23:4), “I have prepared the seven altars [and offered a ram and a bull on each altar].” It said to him (in Prov. 15:17), “’Better a meal of vegetable greens [where there is love than a fattened ox with hatred in it].’ Better the dinner of unleavened bread and bitter herbs which Israel ate in Egypt, than bulls which you offer with hands of [hatred].” (Numb. 23:5) “So the Lord put a word (<i>davar</i>) in Balaam's mouth,” which twisted his mouth and pierced it,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Both “twisted” and “pierced” connote the use of a bit on a horse.</i> as one would drive a nail into a board. R. Eliezer (understanding <i>davar</i> as word) says, “An angel was speaking,” [as stated] (in Numb. 23:5), “Return unto Balak and speak thus.” (Numb. 23:6) “So he returned unto him, and there he was standing beside his burnt offerings with all the ministers of Moab,” who stood anxiously awaiting [the time] when he would come. 
19 (Numb. 23:7) “So he took up his theme and said, ‘From Aram, Balak the king of Moab has brought me, from the hills of the east.’” I was one of the exalted ones,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ramim.</i> The midrash links this word with ARAM in Numb. 23:7.</i> but Balak has brought me down to the pit of corruption. (Ibid.) “Brought me (<i>yanheni,</i> rt.: <i>nhh</i>),” [is to be understood] just as you say (in Ezek. 32:18), “bring (rt.: <i>nhh</i>) the masses of Egypt [and cast them down [… unto the lowest part of the netherworld along with those who go down to the pit].”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Numb. 23:7 comes to mean that Balak BROUGHT (rt.: <i>NHH</i>) Balaam down to the grave. The unusual Biblical translation is necessary to fit the sense of the midrash.</i> Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:7), “From Aram”: I was with the highest (<i>ram</i>) of the high, and Balak has brought me down from my glory. [The matter] is comparable to one who was walking with the king. When he saw [some] robbers,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>lestai.</i></i> he left the king and toured along with the robbers. When he returned to be with the king, the king said to him, “Go with whomever you have toured with, because it not possible for you to walk with me again.” Similarly Balaam had been bound to the holy spirit. When he paired himself with Balak, the holy spirit departed from him. So he returned to being a diviner as in the beginning. Thus it is stated (at his execution in Josh. 13:22), “Balaam ben Beor the diviner….” Therefore did he yell out, “I was high up (<i>ram</i>), and Balak brought me down.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:7), “From Aram, he has brought me”: [Balaam] said to [Balak], “We are alike, even both of us, for being ungrateful, because were it not for their father Abraham, there would have been no Balak. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:29), ‘And it came to pass that when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot away.’ Except for Abraham, he would not have delivered Lot from Sodom; and you are one of the children of the children of Lot.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">As a Moabite, Balak was descended from Moab, the son of Lot. See Gen. 19:37.</i> Moreover, if it were not for their father Jacob, I should not have been present in the world, because Laban had sons only through the merit of Jacob, since it is written at the beginning (in Gen. 29:9), ‘Rachel came with the sheep.’ Now if he had sons, how was his daughter a shepherdess? As soon as Jacob came there, sons were given to him, as stated (in Gen. 31:1), ‘Now he heard the things that Laban's sons [were saying].’<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Jewish tradition gives three views on Balaam’s relation to Laban: That he was Laban himself, that he was Laban’s nephew, and that he was Laban’s grandson. See Ginzberg, vol. III, p. 354; vol.. V, p. 303, n. 229; vol. VI, pp. 123f., nn. 722f.; p. 130, n. 764.</i> And it also says [that Laban said] (in Gen. 30:27), ‘I have learned by divination that the Lord has blessed me for your sake.’” (Numb. 23:7, cont.) “Come, curse Jacob for me”: Whoever curses [the Children of Jacob] is cursing himself, since it is stated (in Gen. 12:3), “and the one who curses you, I will curse.” It also says (in Gen. 27:29), “cursed be those who curse you.” (Numb. 23:7) “Come, curse [Jacob] for me […].” If you had told me to curse another people, for example, the Children of Abraham and Isaac, I would have been able [to do so]. But Jacob? When a king selects a portion for himself, and someone else gets up and speaks disparagingly about it, will he keep his life? Now these people are the Holy One, blessed be He’s, heritage, His portion, and His treasure. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:9), “For the Lord's share is His people; Jacob the portion of His heritage.” And it is written (in Exod. 19:5), “and you shall be My treasure.” (Numb. 23:7, cont.) “And come, denounce Israel:” When a king takes a crown and puts it on his head, and someone says of it that it is nothing, will he keep his life? Now in regard to these people it is written about them (in Is. 49:3), “Israel, in whom I will be glorified.” (Numb. 23:8) “How shall I curse [the one] whom God has not cursed”: When they deserved to be cursed, they were not cursed: When Jacob went in to receive the blessings, he went it with deception. As it is written (in Gen. 27:16), “[Then she clothed his arms and the hairless part of his neck] with the skins of goat kids.” His father said to him (in Gen. 27:18), “Who are you?” He said to him (in vs. 19), “I am Esau, your first-born.” Does not the one who puts forth a lie with his mouth deserve to be cursed? Yet not only [was he not cursed], but he was blessed; as stated (in Gen. 27:33), “he shall also be blessed.” So how do I curse them? (In the words of Numb. 23:8) “God has not cursed.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:8), “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” According to universal custom, when a legion<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>legio.</i></i> rebels against the king, it incurs the penalty of death. Now since these denied and revolted against Him, when they said [about the calf] (in Exod. 32:4), “This is your god, O Israel,” was it not necessary to have Him destroy them at that time? [Still] He did not cease to cherish them. Instead He had clouds of glory accompany them. Nor did He withhold the manna and the well from them. And so it says (in Exod. 32:4), “When they made a molten calf,” (in Neh. 9:18-20), “You in Your great mercies did not abandon them in the desert […]; and You did not withhold Your manna from their mouth […].” How can I curse them? (Numb. 23:8) “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed” When He commanded them concerning the blessings and the curses, He mentioned them (as the people) in connection with the blessings where it is stated (in Deut. 27:12), “These shall stand [on Mount Gerizim] for blessing the people;” but He did not mention them in connection with the curses. Thus it is stated (in vs. 13), “And these shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse.” Moreover, when they sin and He plans to bring a curse upon them, it is not written that He Himself is bringing them (i.e., the curses); but with respect to the blessings, He Himself is blessing them; for so it says (in Deut. 28:1, 8), “And it shall come to pass that, if you diligently obey […], the Lord your God will set you high [over all the nations of the earth]. The Lord will command the blessing to be with you.” But with respect to the curses, it is written (according to Deut. 28:15), “And it shall come to pass that, if you do not obey […], then [all these curses] shall come upon you,” [i.e.,] of their own accord. Ergo (in Numb. 23:8), “How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?” (Numb. 23:9) “For from the top of the rocks I see him,” in order to make the hatred of that evil man (i.e., Balaam) known to you. As from his blessing you may know his thoughts. To what is he comparable? To someone who came to chop down a tree. One who is not an expert chops off the branches one at a time and becomes tired, but the clever one exposes the roots and [then] chops it down. Similarly that wicked man said, “Why shall I curse each and every tribe? Rather I will go to their roots.” When he came to touch them, he found them hard [to cut]. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 23:9), “For from the top of the rocks I see him.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:9): “For from the top of the rocks,” these are the patriarchs; (ibid., cont.) “and from the hills I behold him,” these are the matriarchs. (Numb. 23:9, cont.) “Here is a people dwelling alone”: When He makes them rejoice, no nation rejoices along with them. But when the nations are rejoicing in this world, they (i.e., the Children of Israel) eat with each and every kingdom, and no one is charging [such pleasures] against their account (rt: <i>hshb</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">In other words the pleasures that Israel enjoys in this world are not to be deducted from their pleasures in the world to come.</i> It is so stated (in Numb. 23:9, cont.), “and they shall not be reckoned (rt.: <i>hshb</i>) among the nations.” (Numb. 23:10) “Who has counted the dust of Jacob”: Who is able to count the commandments which they carry out upon the dust: (In Deut. 22:10,) “You shall not plow with an ox and an ass”; (in Deut. 22:9,) “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed”; (in Numb. 19:9,) “Then someone clean shall gather the ashes of the heifer”; (in Numb. 5:17,) “[Then the high priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel] and some of the dust which is on the floor of the tabernacle”; (in Lev. 19:23,) “[Moreover, when you come into the land and plant any tree for food, you shall count its fruit as forbidden,] three years it shall be forbidden to you, [it shall not be eaten]”; and so on with all of them. (Numb. 23:10, cont.) “Or numbered the sand (<i>rb</i>') of Israel,” [i.e.,] their copulations (rt.: <i>rb</i>')<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">For this interpretation, cf. <i>Nid.</i> 31a.</i> Who can number the masses<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> that have emerged from them, from those women who seize on and cherish the commandments (of procreation), as stated (in Gen. 30:15), “But she said to her, ‘Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband?’” [And so too (in Gen. 30:3, 9),] “Here is my maid Bilhah; go into her.” “When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, [she took her maidservant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife].” [And so too (in Gen. 16:3),] “So Abraham's wife Sarai took her maidservant Hagar the Egyptian… [and gave her to her husband Abraham as a wife].” (Numb. 23:10, cont.) “Let me die the death of the upright”: The matter is comparable to a butcher who came to slaughter a cow that belonged to a king. The king began to take notice. When [the butcher] realized [what was happening], he began by discarding the knife, then giving [the cow] a rubdown [and] filling the feeding trough for it. He began to say, “Let my life be forfeit for coming to slaughter it; but observe that I have [now given it sustenance].” Similarly Balaam said, “Let my life be forfeit for coming to curse, but I will bless [them].” Ergo (in Numb. 23:10), “let me die the death of the upright!” (Numb. 23:14) “So he took him to the Field of Zophim at the top of Pisgah”: He saw that [Israel would be] breached there, for it was there that Moses died, as stated (in Deut. 3:27), “Go up to the top of Pisgah …, [for you shall not cross over this Jordan].” Is there a breach greater than this? What he saw was through divinations, and he was of the opinion that because of him they would fall there.
19 (Numb. 23:14-16) “And he built seven altars [and offered a ram and a bull on each altar]. Then he said unto Balak, ‘Stand here [beside your burnt offerings and let me make myself available to the Lord over there]….’ And God appeared to Balaam and he placed a word (<i>davar</i>) in his mouth”: Like a man who places a bit upon the mouth of his animal and twists him to where he wants [it to go]. So was the Holy One, blessed be He, twisting his mouth. When he said to him, “Return to Balak and bless them,” he said, “Why should I go to him to anguish him?” [So] he sought to go to [his own home] and not to Balak. The Holy One, blessed be He, put a bit into his mouth, [and said] (in Numb. 23:16, cont.) “Return to Balak and speak thus.” (Numb. 23:17) “So he came unto him, and there he was standing beside his burnt offerings [together with the ministers of Moab].” Concerning the first occasion, it is written (in Numb. 23:6), “with all the ministers of Moab.” When they saw that they had derived no benefit at all, they left him; and only a small portion of the ministers of Moab were left with him. (Numb. 23:17) “Balak said to him, ‘What did the Lord say’”: When he saw that [Balaam] was not in control of himself to say what he wanted, [Balak] sat himself down and mocked him. As soon as he saw that he was mocking him, Balaam said to him, “Get up from there. It is not fitting to sit while the words of the Omnipresent are being spoken.” (Numb. 23:18) “Rise up Balak and listen; give ear to me, you son of Zippor”: Both of them were [distinguished] sons of [undistinguished] fathers, for they had made themselves greater than their fathers.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">On the importance of having a distinguished lineage, see, e.g., <i>Ta‘an</i> 21b.</i> [Hence] (in Numb. 24:3), “An oracle of Balaam son of Beor (literally, his son is Beor)”; (in Numb 23:18) “give ear to me, you son of Zippor (literally, his son is Zippor)!” <sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The unusual wording of Numb. 23:18 and 24:3 suggests that Balak and Balaam both had fathers undistinguished enough to be called their sons.</i> (Numb. 23:19) “God is not a human, that he should speak falsehood”: He is not like flesh and blood. [When a person of] flesh and blood acquires friends and finds others nicer than they, he forsakes the former ones. But [the Holy One, blessed be He,] is not like that. It is not possible [for Him] to be false to the oath of the early ancestors. (Ibid., cont.) “Has he promised and not fulfilled”: (This phrase can also be read as, “He has promised and not fulfilled.”) When he promises to bring evils upon them, He will cancel them, if they have repented. You find it written (in Exod. 22:19), “Whoever sacrifices to a god shall be devoted to destruction.” When they made the calf, they merited destruction. So I thought to curse and destroy them. But when they repented a little, He suspended [any punishment] and (according to Exod. 32:14) “The Lord repented of the evil which He had planned to do to His people.” And so too in many places. As he said to Jochaniah (in Jer. 22:30), “as none of his seed shall succeed….” But He said (in Hag. 2:22), “And I will overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the might of the kingdoms of the nations,” [since it is stated] (Hag. 2:23), “’On that day,’ declares the Lord of Hosts, ‘I will take you, O My servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,’ declares the Lord, ‘and make you as a signet.’” And so He suspended what He said to his [grand]father (in Jer. 22:24), “’As I live,’ declares the Lord, ‘if you, O King Coniah, son of Jehoiakim, of Judah, were a signet on My right hand, I would tear you off even from there.’” And so with the men of Anatoth, it is written (in Jer. 11:23), “No remnant shall be left of them, for I will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth.” [But] once they repented, see what is written (in Neh. 7:27), “The men of Anatoth were one hundred [and twenty-eight].” (Numb. 23:21) “No one has beheld falsehood in Jacob […]”: Balaam said, “He does not pay attention to the transgressions in their hands, He only pays attention to their merit.” (Numb. 23:21, cont.) “The Lord their God is with him”:<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In the Biblical context the HIM would normally refer to Israel, but the midrash understands this HIM in the singular throughout this paragraph.</i> You (Balak) said to me (in Numb. 23:7), “Come, curse [Jacob] for me.” If an orchard has no keeper, a thief is able to harm it; or if the keeper falls asleep, the thief will enter [it]. But in the case of these people (according to Ps. 121:4), “Behold, the One keeping Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.” So how can I harm [Israel]? (Numb. 23:21) “The Lord their God is with him (i.e., Moses)”: Balak said to him, “Since you cannot touch them because of Moses, who protects them, look at [Joshua,] his successor, and what he will be.” He said to him, “He also will be strong like him.” (Numb. 23:21, cont.) “A royal war cry is within him.” He is blowing [a trumpet], giving a war cry, and throwing down a wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the wall of Jericho.</i> (Numb. 23:22) “God brings them out of Egypt”: You said to me (in Numb. 22:5), “’Here is a people that has come out of Egypt,’ on their own. But that is not so. Rather [God] brought them out.” (Ibid., cont.) “Like the heights<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>T‘P</i>. The word can also mean “horns” and is so translated in most English versions in order to fit the context of the next word (<i>R’M</i>), which is then understood to mean “wild ox.” See the following note.</i> of His loftiness (<i>r'm</i>)”:<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">In most translations the word is understood to mean “wild ox,” but the midrash regards it as a derived from the root <i>RWM</i>, a verb meaning “to be high.”</i> Such is His nature. [When] they sinned a little, He brought them down like a bird, as stated (in Hos. 9:11), “Ephraim's glory shall fly away like a bird.” [When] they are worthy, He raises them up and exalts (rt.: <i>rwm</i>) them on high like a bird. Thus it is stated (in Is. 60:8), “Who are these that fly like a cloud?” (Numb. 23:23) “There is no augury in Jacob and no divination in Israel”: Here you are (Balak) practicing augury and divining in what place you may prevail against them, but they are not like that. When they have to fight against enemies, a high priest stands up and puts on <i>urim</i> and <i>thummim</i>, which are asked about [the will of] the Holy One, blessed be He. So all the gentiles practice divination and augury, but these (Israelites) prove them false through repentance. It is so written (in Is. 44:25), “Who frustrates omens of liars and confounds diviners.”<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>yShab.</i> 6:9 (8d).</i> (Numb. 23:23, cont.) “Now it is said for Jacob and for Israel, ‘What has God done?’”: His (i.e., Balaam's) eye saw that Israel was sitting (<i>yoshevim</i>) before the Holy One, blessed be He, like a pupil before his master in the future to come and was asking Him why each and every <i>parashah</i> was written; and so it says (in Is. 23:18), “for her<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash reads the HER as referring to Torah, but in the context of Isaiah the HER refers to Tyre as a harlot.</i> profits shall belong to those who dwell (<i>yoshevim</i>) before the Lord […].” It also says (in Is. 30:20), “and no more shall your Teacher hide Himself, for your eyes shall see your Teacher.” The ministering angels will ask them, “What has the Holy One, blessed be He, taught you?” As they cannot enter their (i.e., Israel's) precincts, as stated (in Numb. 23:23), “now it is said for Jacob and for Israel, [‘What has God done?’]” (Numb. 23:24) “Here is a people rising up like a lion.” You have no nation in the world like them. Here they are sleeping away from the Torah and the commandments. [Then] having risen from their sleep, they stand up like lions. Quickly reciting the <i>Shema</i>', they proclaim the sovereignty of the Holy One, blessed be He. Then having become like lions, they embark on worldly business pursuits. If one of them should stumble with all of them, or if destroying demons come to touch one of them, he proclaims the sovereignty of the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">On reciting the <i>Shema</i>‘ to be safe from demons, see <i>yBer.</i> 1:1 (2d); <i>Ber.</i> 5a; M.

Thus it is stated (Ps. 130:6), “My soul [yearns] for the Lord more than the watchmen for the morning, the watchmen for the morning.” For that reason Balaam says, “What nation is like this one.” (Numb. 23:24, cont.) “[And drunk] the blood of the slain”: He prophesied that Moses would not die, until he had taken vengeance upon him and the five kings of Midian, as stated (Numb. 23:24), “it does not sleep until it has eaten its prey,” this [prey] is Balaam; “and drunk the blood of the slain,” [these are the five kings of Midian. It is so stated] (in Numb. 31:8), “And they slew the five kings of Midian upon their corpses.” (Numb. 31:6) “With the vessels of the sanctuary”: This is the [high priestly diadem] plate upon which it is written (according to Exod. 28:36), “holy to the Lord.”<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">For a description, see <i>Shab.</i> 63b; <i>Suk.</i> 5a.</i> (Numb. 31:6, cont.) “And the trumpets for sounding the alarm in his hand”: Moses said to Israel, “Balaam the wicked is practicing magic for you<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the parallel account in Gen.

Is it not in fact written (in Numb. 24:25), “Then Balaam arose and went back to his own place?” It is simply this: when he heard that twenty-four thousand [Israelites] had fallen (in Numb. 25:9) through his counsel,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">See Deut.

21 (Numb. 24:3) “So he took up his theme and said.”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">These words also appear in Numb. 23:7, 18; 24:15, 20, 21, 23, but the context of this verse certainly fits the sense of the midrash.</i> A legal teaching: In the case of one who eats without washing his hands, what penalty will he incur? Thus have our masters taught: Washing hands before the meal is an option; after the meal it is an obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hul</i>. 105a, but not in the Mishnah.</i> It once happened at the time of [religious persecutions] that there was an Israelite shopkeeper who would cook [and sell] both clean meat and pork, so that they would not notice that he was a Jew. Now his custom was this: Whenever anyone came into his shop and did not wash his hands, he knew that he was a foreigner and he would set pork before him; but whenever anyone washed his hands and recited the blessing, he knew that he was a Jew and would serve him clean meat. Once a certain Jew came in to eat there but did not wash his hands. Thinking that he was a foreigner, he set pork before him. He ate without saying the blessing. When he came to settle the account with him for the bread and for the meat (the pork was expensively priced). He said to him, “I have such and such against you over the meat which you have eaten, for the slice is worth ten <i>manah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>mna</i>.</i> He said to him, “Yesterday I ate it for eight. Now today you want ten!” He said to him, “This which you ate is from a hog.” When he said this to him, his hair stood on end, for he became terrified and afraid. He said to him privately, “I am a Jew and you have given me pork!” He said to him, “A curse upon you! When I saw that you ate without washing your hands and without a blessing, I thought that you were a foreigner.” Hence the sages have said, “The [omission of the] first water (before the meal) caused him to serve him pork; [the neglect of] the latter water (after the meal) took a life.”<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yoma</i> 83b; <i>Hul</i>. 106a.</i> [The second part of the previous statement is due to] a story about a certain person who ate pulse without washing his hands. When he went down to the marketplace, his hands were filthy from the pulse. When an acquaintance of his saw him, he went and said to his wife, “Your husband has mentioned as a token<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Siman.</i> Gk.: <i>semeion.</i></i> to you [of my authenticity] that he has just now eaten pulse.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the fact that he knew what his friend had just eaten would be evidence of his having spoken with him.</i> Send him that ring.” [So] she gave it to him. After a time her husband came. He said to her, “Where is the ring?” She said to him, “So and so came with your tokens, and I gave it to him.” Becoming filled with rage, he arose and killed her. Therefore the sages have said, “Whoever does not wash his hands after the meal is like one who takes a life.” Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, has warned Israel not to transgress even insignificant commandments, as stated (in Deut. 32:47), “For it (the Torah) is no empty thing for you, in that it is your very life.” Even some commandment that you consider to be empty and insignificant has within it life and length of days. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “If you keep My commandments, I will cast down your enemies before you,” as stated (in Ps. 81:14-15), “O that my people would listen to Me, that Israel would walk in My ways. Then I would virtually subdue their enemies.” When Balaam saw how Israel observed [even] the insignificant commandments, he said, “Who can curse these people, when they observe commandments and when His name is shared with them.” It is so stated (in Numb. 23:21), “The Lord their God is with them.” Whoever curses them is as if he curses the face of the Divine Presence, because His name is joined with them.”<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the name <i>El</i> (“God”) forms part of the name Isra<i>el</i>.</i> He began turning to oracles, as stated (in Numb. 24:3), “So he took up his theme.” This text is related (to Prov. 27:14), “[Whoever rises early in the morning to] bless his neighbor in a loud voice [shall have it reckoned to him as a curse].” When Balaam came to curse Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, diverted his tongue, so that he began to bless. It is so stated (in Deut. 23:6), “But the Lord your God did not want to heed Balaam; so the Lord your God turned [the curse into a blessing for you].” The Holy One, blessed be He, put power in his voice and his voice went from one end of the world to the other, so that the nations would hear that he was blessing [Israel]. Now it is stated concerning him (in Prov. 27:14), “Whoever [rises early in the morning to] bless his neighbor in a loud voice [shall have it reckoned to him as a curse].” [This is] as stated (in Numb. 24:14), “come, let me advise you.” Then he killed twenty-four thousand. There is no curse [as damaging] as this.
22 (Numb. 25:1) “While Israel was staying at Shittim: A legal teaching: By virtue of how many things was Israel redeemed from Egypt? Thus have our masters taught: Israel was redeemed from Egypt by virtue of four things: (1) that they did not change their names, (2) that they did not change their language, (3) that they did not disclose their secrets. For Moses said to them (in Exod. 3:22), “But each woman shall borrow objects of silver, objects of gold, and clothing from her neighbor.” Now the command was entrusted to them for twelve months, but they never revealed it to the Egyptians.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Gk. and Lat.: <i>mysteria.</i></i> and (4) that they were not unbridled in unchastity,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. R. 32:5; Cant. R. 4:12:1; <i>PRK</i> 11:6; M. Pss. 114:4; also <i>Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, Pisha</i> 5; Exod. R. 1:28.</i> as written (in Cant. 4:12), “A locked garden is my sister my bride,” these are the males; “a locked fountain, a sealed spring,” these are the virgins (the females). You yourself know that it is so, since there was [but] one exception and Scripture aired her case (in Lev. 24:10), “Now there went out the son of an Israelite woman….”<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">If he were not a bastard, his father’s name would have been given.</i> Now in all those forty years that they were in the desert, they never committed the sin of unchastity, until they came to Shittim. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 25:1), “While Israel was staying at Shittim, the people began to go whoring.” At Shittim, because they had committed folly (<i>shetut</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The word can also mean “idolatry.”</i> [as stated] (in Prov. 6:32), “One who commits adultery with a woman has no sense.” (Numb. 25:1) “[While Israel was staying at Shittim,] the people began to go whoring.” There are springs that rear warriors, and there are those that rear weaklings; some that rear handsome ones and some that rear ugly ones; some that rear modest ones and some that rear lecherous ones. The spring of Shittim was one of whoredom, and it watered Sodom. You find that [the men of Sodom] said (in Gen. 19:5), “Where are the men […]; bring them out unto us [that we may know them].” Because that spring was cursed, the Holy One, blessed be He, is going to dry it up [and then renew it],<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Although neither this text nor its parallels contain the bracketed words, some such addition is necessary for the words cited from Joel 4:18 to make sense.</i> as stated (in Joel 4:18), “then a spring shall issue from the house of the Lord and shall water the Wadi of the Acacias (<i>Shittim</i>).” From the days of Abraham they were never unbridled in unchastity, until they came to Shittim and drank of its water. 
23 (Numb. 25:1) “The people began to go whoring unto the daughters of Moab.” Come and see what is written in their leaving from Egypt: (In Ex. 14:2,) “Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp before Pi-Hahiroth (which sounds like liberty, <i>heiruth</i>).” What is the meaning of Pi-Hahiroth? It was a place that was fixed for unchastity. And because they sheltered themselves [from it] in their leaving, it was called Pi-Hahiroth. But these [Moabite women] because they made themselves available to the people, it is written, (in Numb. 25:1), “the people began to go whoring [unto the daughters of Moab].” (Numb. 25:1) “The people began”: Every place that “the people” is mentioned, it is an expression of shame; but every place that “Israel” is mentioned, it is an expression of commendation: (In Numb. 11:1,) “Now the people were as murmurers [speaking evil in the ears of the Lord]”; (in Numb. 21:5,) “So the people spoke against God and against Moses”; (in Numb. 14:1,) “and the people wept on that night”; (in Numb. 14:11), “Until when will the people anger Me”; (in Exod. 32:25,) “And Moses saw that the people were wild”; (in Exod. 32:1,) “and the people gathered together against Aaron”; and similarly in all of them. (Numb. 25:1) “The people began to go whoring.” Throw a stick into the air,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>aer.</i></i> [and] it falls to its place of origin (i.e., its root).<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">For this proverb in other contexts, see Gen. R. 53:15; 86:6.</i> The one who had begun with the whoredom at first, finished with it in the end. Their matriarchs (i.e., the matriarchs of Ammon and Moab) began with whoredom (according to Gen. 19:31-34), “And the first-born said to the younger, ‘Let us give our father to drink […].’ So it came to pass on the next day that the first-born said unto the younger […].” She (the first-born) had instructed her in whoredom, and for that reason the Holy One, blessed be He, had pity on the younger and did not expose her. Rather (according to vs. 35), “and she slept with him”; but with reference to the elder, it is written (in vs. 33), “and slept with her father.”<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Thus in the case of the elder, her incest was specifically mentioned.</i> In the case of the one who began in whoredom at first, her daughters (i.e., the daughters of Moab) went after her to finish [it, as stated (in Numb. 25:1), “the people began] to go whoring unto the daughters of Moab.” (Numb. 25:2) “And they invited the people to the sacrifices for their gods”: Thus they (i.e., daughters of Moab) were going by the counsel of Balaam, as stated (in Numb. 31:16), “Here these women at the bidding of Balaam made the Children of Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ySanh.</i> 10:2 (28cd); <i>Sanh.</i> 106a; <i>PRE</i> 47.</i> They made themselves curtained stalls and installed harlots in them with every object of delight in their hands. Now a girl would have an old woman as an agent, for an old woman would be in front of the shop. During the time that Israel was passing by on the way to the marketplace, the woman would say to him, “Young man, surely you want objects of linen which have come from Beth-Shean!” Then she would show them to him and say to him, “Come inside and you will see fine things”; and when the old woman would tell him a high price, the girl would [give him] a lower one. From then on the girl would tell him, “You are like one of the family. Sit down and choose for yourself.” Now a jug of wine was placed by her, since the wine of gentiles had not yet been forbidden. Then out comes the girl, perfumed and adorned, and seduces him and says to him, “Why do you hate us, when we love you? Take for yourself this article gratis. We all are children of a single man, children of Terah, the father of Abraham. So do you not want to eat from our sacrifices and from our cooking? Here are calves and cocks for you; slaughter them according to your own precepts, and eat.” Immediately she has him drink the wine, and then the Satan burned within him, so that he became a fool for her, as stated (in Hos. 4:11), “Harlotry, wine and young wine sway the heart.” There are also those who say [that] Balaam commanded them not to have them drink the wine, so that they would not be judged as those who are drunk, but as willful sinners. When he sought her out, she said to him, “I am not listening to you until you slaughter it [as a sacrifice] to Peor and bow down to it.” But he would say, “I am not bowing down to idolatry.” And she would say to him, “You only need to reveal yourself to it.” And [since] he had become a fool for her, he would do so. This is what the masters said, “One who reveals himself (to defecate) to Baal Peor – this is its worship” (Sanh. 64a). It is so stated (Numb. 25:2), “and they bowed down to their gods.” (Numb. 25:3) “Thus Israel was joined (rt.: <i>tsmd</i>) to Baal Peor”: At the beginning, they went in chastely, but at the end they went as many teams of pairs, like a pair (<i>tsemed</i>) of oxen. Another explanation: Like a man tied to his work; joined (rt.: <i>tsmd</i>) [to Baal Peor] like bracelets (rt.: <i>tsmd</i>). R. Levi said, “This was more serious than the [sin of the golden] calf, for while in reference to the calf, it is written (in Exod. 32:2), ‘Take off the gold rings,’ here [it is written] (in Numb. 25:3), ‘was joined (rt.: <i>tsmd</i>) [to Baal Peor,]’ like bracelets (rt.: <i>tsmd</i>)]. Because of the calf about three thousand fell, but here (according to Numb. 25:9) [the number fallen is] twenty-four thousand.” (Numb. 25:4) “[…] Take all the heads of the people, and impale them [before the Lord in the sun].” R. Judan said, “He hanged the heads of the people, because they had not protested about the people.” R. Nehemiah said, “He did not hang them. Rather the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, ‘Appoint Sanhedrin<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Sanhedraot.</i> Gk. plural: <i>synhedria.</i></i> heads for them, and let them judge whoever went to Peor.’ He said to him, ‘But who will make such a one known?’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘I will expose them. In the case of whoever has gone astray, the cloud shall be peeled back from upon him, and the sun shall shine upon him in the midst of the congregation. Then they will know anyone who has gone astray and hang him.’” You know for yourself that it is so, as stated (in Numb. 25:5), “So Moses said unto the judges of Israel, ‘Each of you kill [those of] his own people [who have been joined to Baal Peor].’”
24 (Numb. 25:6) “Just then one of the Children of Israel came and brought [a Midianite woman] unto his brothers [before the eyes of Moses and the eyes of the whole congregation of the Children of Israel]”: What reason was there for him doing so? [The incident serves] to teach you that he had respect neither for Heaven nor for mortals. It is stated concerning him (in Prov. 21:24), “An insolent<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: <i>Zed</i>.</i> and arrogant one, scorner is his name; [he acts with arrogant wantonness].” She said to him, “I am surrendering to no one but Moses, as so did my father, Balak, command me, to only surrender to Moses, your leader, since my father is a king” He said to her. “See that I am as great as he is, and [to show you,] I am bringing you before his eyes.” [Then] he seized her by her braid and brought her to Moses. He said to him, “Son of Amram, is this woman permitted or forbidden?” He said to him, “She is forbidden to you.” Zimri said [back] to him, “But that one that you took [as a wife] is a Midianite!” Immediately Moses’ hands weakened and the ruling (<i>halakhah</i>) slipped from his mind. They all wept bitterly. That is what is written (in Numb. 25:6), “they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting.” Why were they weeping? Because they became weak at that time. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king's daughter who had adorned herself for entering the wedding canopy [and] for sitting in the [bridal] palanquin.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>phoreion.</i></i> When she was found indulging in immorality with another, her father and her kinsfolk became weak. So it was with Israel. At the end of forty years (as in Numb. 33:49), “they had camped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittimn on the plains of Moab, and there they became lawless through unchastity. And they weakened Moses and the righteous who were with him, and they were crying. See that [Moses] had [previously] stood up to six hundred thousand [men] with the [golden] calf, as stated (Exod. 32:20), “And he took the calf that they had made.” And [now] he weakened? It was simply so that Phinehas would come and receive his due. Moreover, because [Moses] had been indolent [in the execution of justice], (according to Deut. 34:6) “no one knows his burial place.” [This fact serves] to teach you that one must be as strong as a leopard and as swift as an eagle to do the will of his Creator. From here you learn that the Holy One, blessed be He, is as meticulous with the righteous as a thread of hair.
25 (Numb. 25:7) “When Phinehas [ben Eleazar ben Aaron the priest] saw”: But did they all not see it? And is it not written (in vs. 6), “before the eyes of Moses and the eyes of the whole congregation of the Children of Israel?” It is simply that when he saw the deed, he remembered the ruling (<i>halakhah</i>); that one who cohabits with an Aramean woman will have zealots strike him down. (Numb. 25:7, cont.) “He arose from the midst of the congregation”: From where did he stand up? It is simply that, while they were involved in give and take on the matter of whether or not [the culprit] was liable for death, that man (Phinehas) stood up from the midst of the congregation and volunteered [to carry out the sentence]. (Numb. 25:7, cont.) “And [he] took a spear in his hand”: He put the iron prong in his hand, which he put in his bosom. Then he began [to approach] leaning on the wood like a staff,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., with the iron prong hidden, the spear shaft seemed like a mere staff.</i> because he was afraid of [the culprit's] tribe, as they surrounded him. When he reached them, they said to him, “Why have you come?” He said to them, “I also have come to fulfill my needs.” So they gave him permission, and he entered. For otherwise they would not have given him permission. (Numb. 25:8) “Then he went after the man of Israel into the tent, [and pierced both of them]”: He pierced both of them, the one on top of the other, through the unclean place (i.e., the private parts) of the both of them; lest Israel say there was no defilement there. He was zealous for the name of the Holy One, blessed be He. And twelve miracles occurred for him: The first miracle is that it is common that they would separate one from the other, but the angel adhered them together. The second miracle is that the angel closed their mouths that they not yell out. The third miracle is that [Phinehas was able to] direct [the spear precisely so that] the male genitals of [Zimri] were visible in the genitals of [Cozbi]; because they would have [otherwise] said, “[Phinehas] also went in and fulfilled his needs.” The fourth is that the iron expanded so that he could stab both of them. The fifth is that [the angel] gave him strength in his arm to raise both of them up. The sixth is that there was strength in the pole [of the spear] to lift both of them up. The seventh is that [Zimri and Cozbi] did not fall from the spear, but stayed in their place. The eighth is that the angel raised them up in the manner [of intercourse] on top of the spear for all to see their disgrace. The ninth is that they did not trickle blood, so that Phinehas would not become impure. The tenth is that the Holy One, blessed be He, kept their spirit [alive] so that he would not become impure. The eleventh is that the angel raised the lintel of the house chamber so that both of them would come out suspended in front of the eyes of everyone. The twelfth is when all the members of his tribe were ready to strike him down, an angel went down and smote them before him. When Phinehas saw that [the Holy One, blessed be He,] sought to destroy them, he struck [Zimri and Cozbi] on the ground. When he arose and prayed, [the plague] was removed. That is what is written (in Ps. 106:30), “Then Phinehas arose and interceded,”<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues: AND THE PLAGUE WAS STOPPED.</i> in that he gave the judicial verdict (<i>din</i>). Interceded (rt.: <i>pll</i>) can only denote a judicial verdict (<i>din</i>), since it is stated (in reference to making a reparation Exod. 21:22), “and he shall pay as the judges (rt.: <i>pll</i>) determine.” (Numb. 25:9) “And those who died from the plague […]”: [This is] to inform you that, on every occasion when they fell, they were numbered. There is a parable about a wolf who fell upon a flock of sheep. The owner of the sheep said to the shepherd, “Count how many were lost.” [This] is to inform you how much unchastity distances [from God]; as this was [just one] individual, and [yet] twenty-four thousand fell on his account. This is related to (in Prov. 16:14), “The king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man can appease it, etc.” There is a parable about a king who was passing by when a group of youths were standing in front of him. [When] one of them cursed him, the king was filled with anger against [all of] them. [Then] one of them came and socked the one who cursed the king, [and] the king’s anger was immediately subdued. So too, who caused the Holy One, blessed be He, to go back from His anger and not to destroy all of Israel? One would say it was Phinehas. Ergo, “but a wise man can appease it.” The Holy One, blessed be He, has said, “In this world it is on account of gross misconduct that they were counted; but in the world to come (according to Hos. 2:1), “The number of the Children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered.” Amen, may it be [His] will.

Chapter 21

1 (Numb. 25:11) “Phinehas ben Elazar [who is] the son of Aaron the priest”: The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “It is appropriate that he take his reward, (as in Numb. 25:12) “Therefore I hereby grant My covenant of peace.” Great is the peace that He gave to Phinehas, as the world only functions according to peace. And the Torah is [likewise] completely peace, as stated (Prov. 3:17), “Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.” If someone comes from a journey, we inquire of his peace (wellbeing). So too in the morning, we inquire of his peace; and in the evening we inquire of his peace. And we read the recital of the Shema and we conclude [its blessings] with peace, “who spreads the cover of peace over His people.” And in prayer, we conclude, “Who blesses His people Israel with peace.” The priestly blessing concludes with peace. (Numb. 25:12) “Therefore I hereby grant [My covenant of peace],” as he still survives. And so it says (in Mal. 2:5), “My covenant was with him, [a covenant of] life and peace.” R. Simon ben Halafta said, “There is no vessel that holds blessing like peace, as stated (Ps. 29:11), ‘May the Lord grant His people strength; may the Lord bless His people with peace.’”
2 (Numb. 27:15-16) “And Moses spoke […], ‘Let the Lord, [the God of the spirits of all flesh], appoint…’”: A legal teaching: If one sees crowds<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ochloi.</i></i> of human beings, he says, “Blessed is the One who is learned in mysteries.” [As] just as their faces<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>prosopa</i>.</i> are unlike each other, so are they unlike in temperament. Rather each and every individual has his own individual temperament; and so it says (in Job 28:25), “To fix a weight for the spirit,” [i.e.,] the [spiritual] weight of each and every individual. You yourself know that it is so, because of what Moses asked from the Holy One, blessed be He, at the time of his death, when he said to him, “Master of the world, the temperament of each and every person is revealed to You; and the temperament of one person is unlike the temperament of another. Now that I am departing from them, would You please, if You so desire to appoint a leader over them, appoint over them a person who will bear with each and every one of them according to his temperament, as stated (in Numb. 27:16), “Let the Lord, appoint [...] ….” It does not say, “spirit,” but rather “spirits.” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who took a wife and had a best man (<i>shoshevin</i>). Every time that the king was angry with his wife, the best man would placate<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rt. <i>PYS</i>. Cf. the Gk.: <i>peisis</i> or <i>peisa</i> (“persuasion”).</i> him and the king would be reconciled. When the best man was about to die, he began to make a request of the king. He said to him, “Would you please pay attention to your wife [to be foregoing with her after I die].” The king said to him, “Instead of you charging me concerning my wife, charge my wife concerning me, that she be careful with my honor.” So did the Holy One, blessed be He, as it were, say to Moses, “Instead of you charging Me (in Numb. 27:16), ‘Appoint […],’ charge them concerning Me, that they be diligent with My honor.” What is written below (in Numb. 28:2)? “Command the Children of Israel, and say unto them, ‘My offering, My bread.’” First, arrange the sacrifices for them.
3 What reason did the Holy One, blessed be He, have for tracing the lineage of Phinehas after this act (of slaying Zimri in Numb. 25:8)? [The reason was] that, when Zimri ben Salu was pierced – The sages said Zimri had six names: Zimri: ben Salu; Saul; the son of the Canaanite woman; Shelumiel; and ben Zurishaddai. [He was called] Zimri because of the fact that he became like an addled (<i>hamuzeret</i>) egg (as a result of engaging in multiple acts of intercourse) for this Midianite; ben Salu because he evoked (<i>shehisli</i>) the sins of his family; Saul (<i>Shaul</i>) because he lent (<i>shehishil</i>) himself to sin; the son of the Canaanite woman because of the fact that he performed an act of Canaan. And what is his [true] name? Shelumiel – you find that when Zimri was pierced, the tribes rose up against [Phinehas] and said, “Did you see the son (actually, grandson) of Puti? This man, whose mother's father<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Thus Puti was actually Phinehas’ maternal grandfather, whose full name was Putiel. So Exod. 6:25.</i> fattened calves for idolatry, has killed a tribal prince of Israel!” Therefore Scripture has come to trace his lineage [through his paternal grandfather] (in Numb. 25:11), “Phinehas the son of Eliezer, [who is] the son of Aaron the priest.” (Numb. 25:12) “Therefore I hereby grant [My covenant of peace],” as he still survives. And so it says (in Mal. 2:5), “My covenant was with him, [a covenant of] life and peace […].” (Numb. 25:13) “And it shall belong to him and to his seed after him […, because he was zealous for his God] and atoned [for the Children of Israel]”: Since atonement is spoken of in connection with him, did he offer a sacrifice? [The mention of atonement is] simply to teach you that when anyone sheds the blood of the wicked, it is as if he had offered a sacrifice. (Numb. 25:14) “And the name of the slain man of Israel [...]”: Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, is concerned with the praise of the righteous to publicize<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>PRSM</i>. Cf. Gk.: <i>parresia</i> (“boldness in speaking out”).</i> them throughout the world, so is he concerned with the disgrace of the wicked to publicize them throughout the world. He publicized Phinehas for praise and publicized Zimri for disparagement. About them is it stated (in Prov. 10:7), “The remembrance of a righteous one is for a blessing, but the name of the wicked shall rot.” (Numb. 25:14, cont.) “Zimri ben Salu, the prince of a clan”: As whoever discredits himself discredits his family along with himself. (Numb. 25:14, cont.) “Zimri ben Salu, the prince of a clan”: The verse is astounded by him (in Eccl. 10:8), “The one who breaks through a barrier will be bitten by a snake.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">“To break through a barrier” means “to transgress.”</i> [As it was] his [ancestor Simeon) who was the first to display zeal against harlotry, as stated (in Gen. 34:25), “then two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, [the brothers of Dinah, each] took [his sword]….” And [yet] this (Zimri) broke through the barrier which his [ancestor] had made. (Numb. 25:15) “And the name of the Midianite woman who was slain [was Cozbi bat Zur; Zur was] the tribal head of a clan [in Midian]”: [These words are there] to inform you how far the Midianites gave of themselves. Thus they had abandoned a daughter of a king, as stated (in Numb. 31:8), “[And along with their other victims] they killed the kings of Midian: …, Zur.” [Zur] was the greatest of them all; and [since] he abandoned his daughter, who would not abandon [his own daughter]? But because he had disgraced himself and publicized his daughter to shame, the text has demoted him and numbered him third (on the list). He was, however, the king of them all, as stated (in Numb. 25:15), “[Zur] was leader of the nations of the clan in Midian.”
4 (Numb. 25:17) “Harass the Midianites”: Why? (As in Numb. 25:18,) “Because they are harassing you.” Hence the sages have said, “If someone comes to kill you, act first to kill him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ber.</i> 62b; <i>Sanh</i>. 72a.</i> R. Simeon says, “Whoever causes a person to sin is worse than the one who kills him. Because whoever kills [a person] kills him in this world, but he [still] has a share in the world to come. However, the one who causes him to sin kills him in this world and for the world to come. Two peoples encountered Israel with the sword, and two with sin: The Egyptians and the Edomites with the sword. [Thus it is stated (of the Egyptians] (in Exod. 15:9), “The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will empty my sword.’” [And Edom did the same, as stated] (in Numb. 20:18), “But Edom said unto him, ‘You shall not pass through me, or else I will come out to meet you with the sword.’” Moreover, two [peoples encountered them] with sin, the Moabites and the Ammonites. Concerning the ones who encountered them with the sword, it is written (in Deut. 23:8), “You shall not abhor an Edomite …; you shall not abhor an Egyptian.” But concerning the ones who encountered them with sin to cause Israel to sin, it is stated (according to Deut. 23:4), “No Ammonite or Moabite shall come into [the assembly of the Lord] even to the tenth generation, forever.” 
5 (Numb. 25:17) “Harass the Midianites”: Even though I have written (in Deut. 20:10), “When you draw near unto a city to fight against it, you shall offer terms of peace (<i>shalom</i>) unto it”; however, in regard to these [peoples] you shall not do this; (according to Deut. 23:7), “You shall not seek their welfare (<i>shalom</i>) and benefit.” You find that the one who came to them with the trait of mercy, in the end came to disgrace, war and distress. And who [was that]? David, as stated (in II Sam. 10:2), “David said, ‘I will do kindness with Hanun son of Nahash.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You are transgressing My word, as I wrote (in Deut. 23:7), ‘You shall not seek their welfare and benefit,’ and you are doing acts of kindness with them? (Eccl. 7:12) ‘Do not be greatly righteous,’ such that a man should not forego [what is written in] the Torah. And this one is sending [word] to console the Children of Ammon and to do kindness and good to him?” And in the end, he came to disgrace [as stated] (in II Sam. 10:4), “So Hanun seized David’s courtiers, clipped off one side of their beards and cut away half of their garments at the buttocks, and sent them off.” And he came to war with four nations: Aram-Naharayim, with the kings of Zova, with the kings of Maakha and with Children of Ammon. And it is written (about this in II Sam. 10:9), “Joab saw that there was a battle line against him [both front and rear].” What caused this to David? That he sought to do good to those about whom the Holy One, blessed be He, told him, “You shall not seek their welfare.” Hence it is written (Numb. 25:17), “Harass the Midianites.” 
6 Another interpretation (of Numb. 25:17) “Harass the Midianites”: Since I have written (in Deut. 20:19), “When you besiege (rt. <i>tswr</i>) a city a [long time] […], you shall not destroy its trees,” in the case of these (i.e., Moab and the Ammonites) you shall not do so. On the contrary, their trees you shall destroy. And so you find that when Joram king of Israel, Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and the king of Edom went to fight with Moab, (according to II Kings 3:9) “they circled around on a seven-day march, so that there was no water for the army or for the animals that were with them.” They began to weep, and (according to vs. 10) “The king of Israel said, ‘Alas, for the Lord has summoned these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.’” Jehoshaphat answered (in vs. 11), “Is there no prophet of the Lord here through whom we may inquire of the Lord […]?” [This passage is] to make known the wickedness of Joram, in that he did not acknowledge Him, but rather only Jehoshaphat acknowledged Him. (Vs. 12) “Then Jehoshaphat said, ‘The word of the Lord is with him’; so the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, [and the king of Edom] went down unto him”: Why is Jehoshaphat not called a king here? In order to make known the humility of that righteous man, in that he did not want to go down before the prophet in royal garb, but as a commoner.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>idiotes.</i></i> But some say, “[It was] because an edict had been decreed that he would be killed with Ahab that the scriptural text has reckoned [the reign of] his son from that hour. For that reason ‘king’ was not written.” But as a reward for their going down to the prophet, they attained the right to see all those miracles. When the king of Israel saw Elisha, Elisha said to the king of Israel (according to vs. 13,) “What have I to do with you; go unto the prophets of your father and unto the prophets of your mother,” as he never asked him [anything] all of his days. He began to implore him, (as in ibid., cont.) “And the king of Israel said to him […].” (Vss. 14-17) “Elisha said, ‘As the Lord of hosts lives […]. Now then get me a musician […].” He gave them the water that they needed. Moreover, he said to them “The Moabites shall fall into your hands, (in vs. 19) ‘thus you shall smite every fortified city and every choice city, [you shall also fell every good tree].’” They said to him, “[But] the Holy One, blessed be He, said (in Deut. 20:19), ‘You shall not destroy its trees’; yet you are saying [to do] so.” He said to them, “He gave the command with reference to the rest of the nations, but this one is insignificant and contemptable,” as stated (in II Kings 3:18), “This one is insignificant in the eyes of the Lord, so He will give Moab into your hands.” It is [also] stated (in Deut. 23:7), “You shall not seek their welfare and benefit (literally, their good).” [That is referring to] the good trees. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 25:17), “Harass the Midianites.”
7 (Numb. 26:1-2) “And it came to pass after the plague [that the Lord said unto Moses and unto Elazar ben Aaron the priest, saying,] ‘Take a census’”: Every time that they fell, they were required to be numbered. The matter is comparable to the wolf who went into the midst of the flock. The owner of the flock was obliged to count them to know how many were missing. Another interpretation (of Numb. 26:2): Why did he count them [here]? The matter is comparable to a shepherd to whom the householder has delivered a flock after numbering them. [After] he has fulfilled his guardianship, when he returns them, it is necessary for them to be numbered. Thus when Israel went out from Egypt the Holy One, blessed be He, delivered them to Moses after numbering [them], as stated (in Numb. 1:1-2), “Then the Lord spoke unto Moses in the Sinai desert …, ‘Take a census […].’” [Likewise] (in Exod. 12:37), “Then the Children of Israel traveled from Ramases to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot.” Ergo, he received them with a numbering in Egypt. [So when] he was about to pass away from the world in the Plains of Moab (after completing his guardianship), he returned them with a numbering.

10 (Numb. 27:1) “Then came forward the daughters of Zelophehad”: In that generation the women were fencing<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">On raising a fence about the Law, see <i>Avot</i> 1:1.</i> that which the men were breaching. Accordingly you find that Aaron said to them (i.e., the men in Exod. 32:2), “Take off the gold rings that are in the ears of your wives”; but the women were unwilling and protested against their husbands. Thus it is stated (in vs. 3), “So all the people took off the gold rings that were in their<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since “their” is masculine here, there is an implication that the men only took their own earrings.</i> ears.” Thus the women did not take part in making the [golden] calf. So also in the case of the spies who had spread slander (according to Numb. 14:36), “when they returned, they made [the whole congregation] murmur against him.” A decree was issued against them, because they had said (in Numb. 13:31), “We are unable to go up [against this people for they are stronger than us].” The women, however, were not with them in their counsel. What is written above the matter (in Numb. 26:65)? “Because the Lord had said to them, ‘They shall surely die in the wilderness,’ not a man of them remained […].” [Note that Scripture speaks of] “a man,” and not of "a woman.” Because they (i.e., the men) did not want to enter the land, but the women came forward to ask for an inheritance in the land. Therefore the <i>parashah</i> [about the death of that generation] was written next to this <i>parashah</i>, because what the men broke down the women fenced in. 
11 Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:1): “Then came forward [the daughters of Zelophehad [ben Hepher ben Gilead ben Machir ben Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh ben Joseph]”: [Their action was] an honor to them. [It was also] an honor to their father, an honor to Machir and an honor to Joseph that such righteous and wise women had issued from him. But what was their wisdom? They [only] spoke up at the proper time, when Moses was busy with the <i>parashah</i> about inheritance (in accordance with Numb. 26:53), “To these shall you apportion the land [for an inheritance].” They said to him, “If we are like a son, let us inherit; but if not, let our mother perform levirate marriage (marry her husband's brother).”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">His duty would be to rear children in the name of the deceased father. On levirate marriage generally, see Deut. 25:5-6: also Gen. 38:8-9; Ruth 4:5.</i> Immediately (in Numb. 27:5), “Moses brought their cause before the Lord.” They were righteous, In that they had never been married to someone unworthy of them. Then why did they meet with Moses at the end [of the forty years]? So that he would not [put on airs] over having abstained from his wife for forty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Since Moses regularly stood in the Divine Presence, he needed to preserve an unbroken state of purity.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, informed him through these [women], saying, “Here are women who without being commanded [remained unmarried] for forty years, until they were married to someone worthy of them.”
12 And it is written (in Numb. 27:5) “Moses brought their cause [before the Lord]”: Some say that [God] made this become too hard for Moses, as there are righteous people that become [overly] proud in matters of a commandment, and [so] the Holy One, blessed be He, weakens their ability. You find that David said (in Ps. 119:54), “Your statutes were songs for me,” [meaning] they are light and customary for me like songs. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “By your life, your end will be to err about something that [even] the schoolchildren know about.” At the time that he brought up the ark, he erred and put in on a cart, as stated (in II Sam. 6:3),” They loaded the ark of God onto a new cart.” [So God] suspended the ark in the air and the oxen became dislodged from under it. [Then] Uzzah approached to support it, but (according to II Sam. 6:7,) “God struck him down on the spot,” as an error in study is considered as wanton. Immediately (in II Sam. 6:8), “David was distressed because the Lord had inflicted a breach upon Uzzah.” [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Did you not say, ‘Your statutes were songs for me?’ Did you not learn (in Numb. 7:9), ‘But to the Kohathites he did not give; since theirs was the service of the [most] sacred objects, their porterage was by shoulder?’” [So David] began to ponder and say (in I Chron. 15:13), “The Lord our God burst out against us, for we did not seek Him like the law.” And so too, [this happened] with Moses. Because he said (in Deut. 1:17), “But the case which is too hard for you, you shall bring unto me and I will hear it,” [the Holy One, blessed be He,] weakened his ability.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"> <i>Sifre</i> to Deut. 1:17 (17); <i>Sanh</i>. 8a.</i> The matter is comparable to a moneychanger who said to his student, “If coins come to you to be exchanged, exchange them, but if pearls should come to you, bring them to me.” [When] a ring of baubles came to him, [the student] brought it to [this] teacher. [But] then the teacher went and showed it to another [money changer]. So too here. Moses said (in Deut. 1:17), “The case which is too hard for you, [you shall bring unto me and I will hear it].” [But] when the daughters of Zelophehad came to him, [God] made it too hard for him. (Numb. 27:5-7) “And Moses brought their cause before the Lord. [And the Lord said…,] ‘The daughters of Zelophehad speak correctly,’” such is the law. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Did you not say (ibid.), ‘The case which is too hard for you, [you shall bring unto me]?’ In the case of the judgment which you do not know, [see that even] the women determine it.” 13 Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:5), “Moses brought their cause [before the Lord]”: R. Simeon ben Laqish said, “Our master Moses knew this judgment, but they first came before chiefs of tens. They said to them, ‘It is a judgment concerning inheritance, and this is not for us but for those greater than us.’ They came before the chiefs of fifties. [When] they saw that the chiefs of ten had shown them honor, the chiefs of fifty said, ‘[In our case] also there are those greater than us.’ So also [they came before] the chiefs of hundreds, the chiefs of thousands, and the princes. They all responded to them in a similar way, because they did not want to open their mouths before one who was greater than them. [So] they went in front of Elazar. He said to them, Behold there is Moses our teacher’ These and those came in front of Moses. Moses said, ‘If I tell them the decision, I shall be appropriating the greatness.’ He said to them, ‘In my case also there is One greater than I.’ Therefore (in Numb. 27:5), ‘Moses brought their cause [before the Lord].’” He answered him with (in vs. 7), “The daughters of Zelophehad speak correctly.” Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, acknowledged their utterance. (Numb. 27:7, cont.) “You shall indeed grant them [possession of an inheritance among the brothers of their father]”: Give them [also] chattel and their father's birthright in the assets of Hepher. They took three portions: The portion of their father, who was among those who had come out from Egypt; his portion with his brothers in the assets of Hepher; and since he was the first born, he took two portions. Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:7), “you shall indeed grant them [possession of an inheritance among the brothers of their father]”: After they [already] received [their share] on the other side of the Jordan, they came before Joshua and Elazar in the land of Canaan, as stated (in Josh. 17:4), “Now they (i.e., the daughters of Zelophehad) came before Elazar the priest, Joshua ben Nun, and the princes and said, ‘The Lord commanded Moses [to give us an inheritance along with our male kin’].” Moreover, our ancestor Jacob also knew that they were receiving [an inheritance] on this side [of the Jordan as well as on that side], since it is stated (in Gen. 49:22), “daughters<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">English versions generally read “boughs” or the like.</i> step over a wall.” This [wall] is the Jordan, which became a wall [for Moses] so that he would not enter the land. Thus Jacob said to Joseph, “Your daughters shall receive a share on this [side of the Jordan] as well as on that [side].” (Numb. 27:7, cont.) “And you shall transfer to them the inheritance of their father”: With reference to inheritance of a son it is stated (in vs. 9), “and you shall give,” but with reference to a daughter, [it says (in vs. 8),] “and you shall transfer.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew is slightly different here from what is written in vs. 7. There the word you is singular while here the “you” is plural, as in vs. 8.</i> Thus she may transfer an inheritance from tribe to tribe.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">So <i>BB</i> 109b.</i> (Numb. 27:11) “And it shall be a statutory judgment for the Children of Israel”: [The word judgment] teaches that inheritances [can only] be carried out through judges. 
14 (Numb. 27:12) “Then the Lord [said] unto Moses, saying, ‘Go up on this mountain of Abarim […].’”: What reason did he have [for it] to be written after the <i>parashah</i> about inheritance? It was simply that when Moses heard from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, (in Numb. 27:7), “you shall indeed grant them,” he thought that the Holy One, blessed be He, had been reconciled to him. He said, “Here I am giving the inheritance to Israel.” [Hence] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “My decree remains in place; (Numb. 27:12-13) ‘Go up into the mountain of Abarim [… and you shall be gathered to your people] like your brother Aaron was gathered.’ You are no better than your brother [in this].’”
15 (Numb. 27:16) “[…] Let the Lord, the God of the spirits [of all flesh], appoint”: Anyone who comes to seek the needs of the community is as if he comes forcefully. (Numb. 27:16) “Let the Lord appoint”:  What reason did [Moses] have to request this need after the ordering of inheritance? It is simply that since he saw the daughters of Zelophehad inherit the properties of their father, Moses said, “See it is the time for me to claim my needs. If daughters inherit, it is [also] proper for my sons to inherit my glory.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Prov. 27:18), “’He who tends a fig tree will enjoy its fruit.’ Your sons sat [with] their own [concerns] and were not involved with Torah [study]. [Whereas] Joshua served you much and showed you much honor. And he got up early to your house of meeting and left late. He arranged the benches and spread out the mats. Since he served you with all of his ability, he is worthy to serve Israel, so as not to lose his compensation.” (Numb. 27:18) “Take Joshua bin Nun,” in order to fulfill what is stated (in Prov. 27:18), “He who tends a fig tree will enjoy its fruit.”
16 Another interpretation of (Numb. 27:16) “Let the Lord, appoint”:  A parable: A king saw an orphan woman [and] sought to take her for him as a wife. He sent to seek her. She said, “I am not worthy to marry the king.” He sent to seek her seven times, but she did not allow it. In the end she married him. After a time, the king was angry with her and sought to divorce her. She said, “I did not seek to be married to you; you sought me. Since this is so and you have decreed to divorce me and to take another, do not do to that one like what you did to me.” So is it with the Holy One, blessed be He: R. Samuel the son of Nahmani said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, tried for seven days to persuade Moses from the midst of the burning bush, but Moses replied, (in Exod. 4:13), ‘Send please, whomever you will send’; (ibid. 4:10) ‘I am not a man of words, neither yesterday nor the day before.’ This indicates seven days. After time, the Holy One, blessed be He persuaded him; and he went as His agent; and He did all of those miracles through him. In the end, He said to him (in Numb. 20:12), ‘You shall not bring.’ Moses said, ‘Master of the world, (as in Deut. 3:24), “You who let Your servant see the first works of Your greatness, etc.” Since this is so [and] You have decreed against me, do not do like what You did to me to the one that will go in. Rather (as in Numb. 27:17), ‘Who shall go out before them and come in before them.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, (in Numb. 27:18) “Take Joshua bin Nun.” And Moses did [it] with a generous eye, as stated (Prov. 22:9), “The generous man is blessed.” A parable: A king said to one of his household, “Give so and so a <i>seah</i> of wheat.” He went and agave him two <i>seah</i>. He said to him, “One <i>seah</i> is from the king and one <i>seah</i> is from me.” So did the Holy One, blessed be He say to Moses (in Numb. 27:18), “And lay your hand upon him” – one hand. What did he do? (In Numb 27:23) “He laid his hands upon him and commissioned him,” to fulfill that which is stated (Prov. 22:9), “The generous man is blessed.” Therefore (as in Prov. 27:18), “He who tends a fig tree will enjoy its fruit.” And why is the Torah compared to a fig tree? Since [the fruit of] most trees – the olive tree, the grapevine, the date palm – is gathered [all] at once, but the fig tree is gathered a little [at a time]. And so too is the Torah. Today he studies a little and tomorrow he studies much; as it is not taught in a year, nor in two. (Numb. 27:18) “A man with the spirit of God with him”: Since you said (in Numb. 27:16), “’The God of the spirits of all flesh,’ since You know each and every one, one should be appointed who knows how to proceed with each and every one of them according to his temperament”; [so then (in Numb. 27:18, cont.),] “and lay your hand upon him,” like one who lights a candle from a candle. (Numb 27:20) “Invest him with your majesty,” like one who pours from one vessel to another vessel. Concerning that which I said to you (in Numb. 36:9), “So the inheritance will not move around from one tribe to another,” this glory will not move from the house of your father, as even Joshua who will arise in your place (according to Numb. 27:19), “shall stand in front of Elazar the priest” (nephew of Moses).
17 (Numb. 28:2) “My offering, My bread”: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Say to those Israelites, ‘It is not that I have a need for the sacrifices, since the whole world is Mine, and I created the animals from which you offer a sacrifice in front of Me.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Men</i>. 110a; <i>PRK</i> 6:1; <i>PR</i> 16:1; 48:3; <i>Tanh</i>., Exod. 8:14.</i> Thus it is stated (in Ps. 50:12), “If I am hungry, I would not tell you.” There is not eating or drinking in front of Me. R. Simon said, “There are thirteen attributes of mercy that are written about the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Exod. 34:6), ‘And the Lord passed over his face and called, “the Lord, ….”’ Is there a merciful one that delivers his victuals to a cruel one?” Ergo (in Ps. 50:12), “If I am hungry, I would not tell you.” R. Judah bar Simon said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I have delivered ten [kinds of] clean animals to you (for food).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See also <i>PR</i> 16:1</i> Three are in your possession, and seven are not in your possession. And I did not burden you to have you seek them in the mountains and the hills, in order to bring Me a sacrifice from those which are not in your possession. Rather [your sacrifices come] from those which are in your possession, which grew up at your feeding trough.’” Ergo (in Ps. 50:12), “If I am hungry, I would not tell you.” R. Isaac said, “It is written (in Numb 28:2), ‘My offering, My bread, for My burnt offering.’ Is there eating and drinking in front of Me? Learn from the ministering angels, as stated (in Ps. 104:4), ‘His servants flaming fire.’” From what are they [then] sustained? R. Judan said in the name of R. Isaac, “They are nourished from the radiance of the Divine Presence, as stated (in Prov. 16:15), ‘The light of the king’s face is light.‘” R. Simeon ben Laqish said, [Regarding (Numb. 28:6),] “’The regular burnt offering done at Mount Sinai.’ If you will say that that there is eating and drinking [in front of Him], learn from Moses, our teacher. Observe what is written about him (in Exod. 34:28), ‘And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water.’ If there was eating and drinking in front of Me, he would have eaten and drank. Ergo (in Ps. 50:12), “If I am hungry, I would not tell you.”

22 (Numb. 28:3) “And you shall say to them, ‘This is the burnt offering which you shall offer to the Lord: two yearling lambs without blemish’”: Not two simultaneously, but (as in vs. 4), “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the second lamb you shall offer at twilight.” R. Judah bar Simon said, “There was none in Jerusalem with sin on their hands. How so? The sacrifice of the morning atoned for the transgressions which were committed during the night, and the daily sacrifice at twilight atoned for transgressions which were committed during the day.” In any case none lodged in Jerusalem with sin on their hands, as stated (in Is. 1:21), “righteousness lodges<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Although the biblical context requires a past tense for this verb, the sense of the midrash assumes a present or a future. Such a translation also fits the later use of the imperfect tense used here.</i> there (i.e., in Jerusalem).” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the Israelites, “In this world you offer showbread and sacrifices before Me, but in the world to come I will prepare a great table for you, with the idolaters looking on in shame.” It is so stated (in Ps. 23:5), “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies […].” It also says (in Is. 65:13), “Behold, My servants shall eat, [but you shall go hungry …].”

25 (Numb. 29:35) “On the eighth day [you shall have] a solemn assembly”: This text is related (to Ps. 109:4), “In return for my love they denounce me, but I am a prayer.” You find that on the Festival (of Tabernacles) Israel would offer seventy bulls for the seventy nations.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Numb. R. 21:24; M. Pss. 109:4; <i>PRK</i> 28:9.</i> Israel said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, “See, we are offering seventy bulls for the seventy nations. Therefore, they should love us. It is not enough that they do not love us, but they also hate us, as stated (in Ps. 109:4), ‘In return for my love they denounce me.’” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “Now you are to offer [sacrifices] for yourselves, (as according to Numb. 29:35,) ‘On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly.” (Numb. 29:36) “Then you shall offer a whole burnt offering, a fire offering, a sweet smell to the Lord: one bull, one ram.’” [The situation] is comparable to a king who made a seven-day banquet and invited all the people of the province for the seven days of the feast. When the seven days of the feast had passed, he said to his friend, “We have already fulfilled our obligation to all the people of the province. Let us, you and me, make do with whatever you find, a pound<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>litra.</i></i> of meat, fish, or greens.” Similarly did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel, “(according to Numb. 29:35), ‘On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly.’ We shall make do, you and I, with whatever you find (as in Numb. 29:36), ‘One bull, one ram.’”
26 (Numb. 29:35) “On the eighth day”: What was the reason for [the number of sacrificial animals] being reduced on each day?  The Torah is simply teaching you etiquette from the sacrifices. Thus if someone goes for lodging,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>Xenia</i>.</i> and his host receives him; on the first day he receives him properly and feeds him fowl. Then on the second he feeds him meat; on the third he feeds him fish; on the fourth he feeds him greens. So does he continue to reduce, until he is feeding him pulse. (Numb. 29:35) “You shall have (literally, there shall be for you)”: What is the meaning of “for you?” [The Holy One, blessed be He,] said to them, “Festival times are fitting for you.” A certain gentile questioned R. Aqiva. He said to him, “Why do you keep festival times? Did not the Holy One, blessed be He, say the following to you (in Is. 1:14), ‘Your new moons and your festival times My soul hates?’” R. Aqiva said to him, “If He had said, ‘My new moons and My festival times My soul hates,’ I should have said [so. But] He said, ‘Your new moons and your festival times’; because of those festival times which Jeroboam instituted, as stated (in I Kings 12:32-33), ‘Jeroboam also instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival in Judah, at Bethel to sacrifice to the calves. And he ascended the altar […] and he made a festival for the Children of Israel […].’ These festival times, however, (the ones ordained by the Holy One, blessed be He,) shall never be abolished. Neither shall the new moons. Why? Because they belong to the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Lev. 23:37), ‘These are the festival times of the Lord.’ And similarly (in Lev. 23:4), ‘These are My festivals times.’” And it is also written (ibid. verse 44), “And Moses told the festival times of the Lord.” They shall, therefore, never be abolished; for it is concerning them that it is stated (in Ps. 111:8), “They are established forever to be performed with faithfulness and uprightness.”

Chapter 22

(Numb. 30:2-3) “And Moses said to the heads of the tribes, ‘When someone makes a vow (<i>neder</i>) to the Lord.’” This is related to that which is written (in Jer. 4:2), “And you shall swear, ‘As the Lord lives,’ [in truth, in justice, and in righteousness].” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Do not think that you have permission to swear in My name even in truth. You are not entitled to swear by My name unless you possess all the following attributes (of Deut. 10:20), ‘The Lord your God you shall fear, Him you shall serve, to Him you shall hold fast, [and by Him you shall swear].’” That you should be like those who were called God-fearing, Abraham, Job, and Joseph: Abraham of whom it is written (in Gen. 22:12), “For now I know that you fear [God].” Concerning Job it is written (in Job 1:1), “the man was blameless and upright, one who feared God.” Concerning Joseph it is written (in Gen. 42:18), “for I fear God.” Ergo (in Deut. 10:20), “The Lord your God you shall fear.” (Deut. 10:20, cont.) “Him you shall serve.” [You do so,] if you turn [all] your attention to the Torah, fulfill [its] commandments and have no other work (<i>abodah</i>). It therefore is stated (ibid.), “Him you shall serve (rt.: '<i>bd</i>).” (Deut. 10:20, cont.) “To Him you shall hold fast.” Can one hold fast to the Divine Presence? Moreover, has it not already been stated (in Deut. 4:24), “For the Lord your God is a consuming fire?” It is simply [being stated with reference to] anyone marrying off his daughter to a scholar who reads [Scripture] and recites [Mishnah], that he engage in commerce<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateia.</i></i> for him and have him benefit from his assets.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ket.</i> 111b; cf. <i>Sot</i>. 14a.</i> It is with reference to [such a] one that it is stated (in Deut. 10:20), “to him you shall hold fast.”<br>If you have all these [attributes] you may swear; if not, you are not entitled to swear. There is a story about King Jannai, that he had two thousand towns and they all were destroyed because of a true oath. How so? One man said to his fellow, “It is an oath that I will walk and eat such and such in place x”; and they would walk and fulfill the oath, and [the towns] were [nevertheless] destroyed. [If] this is with someone that swears truthfully, all the more so with one who swears falsely.
(Numb. 31:2) “Exact vengeance [for the Children of Israel on the Midianites; afterward you shall be gathered unto your people]”: R. Judah said, “If Moses had wanted to live for several [more] years, he could have remained alive; as the Holy One, blessed be He, had made his death dependent upon the vengeance against Midian. It is simply to show you the praise of Moses, as he said, ‘For the sake of my remaining alive, I shall delay the Children of Israel's vengeance on Midian?’ [Rather] immediately (in vs. 3), ‘Moses spoke unto the people, saying, “Arm some of your number (<i>anashim</i>) for the army, and let them fall on Midian.”’” [The word,] <i>anashim,</i> [implies that they were] righteous. So also elsewhere (in Exod. 17:9), “Choose <i>anashim</i> for us.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Here also, as in Numb. 31:3, <i>anashim</i> implies that those chosen were righteous.</i> And so too (in Job 4:13), “in the falling of slumber upon <i>anashim</i>.” (Numb. 31:3, cont.) “To render the vengeance of the Lord against Midian”: The Holy One, blessed be He, had said (in vs. 2), “the vengeance of the Children of Israel”; but Moses says (here in vs. 3), “the vengeance of the Lord.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “It is your judgment that is called for, because they caused Me to harm you.” [But] Moses said, “Master of the world, if we had been uncircumcised or practitioners of star worship or had denied [the binding force of] the commandments, they would not have persecuted us. But [they have done so precisely] because of the Torah and commandments which You have given. The vengeance, therefore, is Yours,” (as in Numb. 31:3), “to render the vengeance of the Lord against Midian.” 
(Numb. 31:4) “[You shall send to the war] a thousand per tribe [from all the tribes of Israel]”: Some say, “He sent two thousand from each and every tribe.” But others say, “Three thousand from each and every tribe, [with twelve thousand fighters], twelve thousand to guard the baggage, and about them it is stated (in Cant. 4:2), ‘Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that are perfectly matched’; and twelve thousand for prayer.” And where is it shown? Where it is stated (ibid.), “A thousand per tribe (literally, a thousand per tribe; a thousand per tribe).” That is twenty-four thousand.  (Numb. 31:5) “So from the thousands in Israel there were furnished a thousand per tribe.” That is twelve thousand others. What is the meaning of “were furnished?” That they were furnished for each other in pairs.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>zeuge, zuga</i>; Lat.: <i>jugera.</i> The probable meaning is that for each thousand who fought, there were a thousand replacements.</i> Another interpretation [of “were furnished”]: They were furnished by force. Since Scripture had made the death of Moses dependent upon the vengeance against Midian, they said, “Shall we go against Midian and let Moses die?” They refrained from going. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Cast lots over the tribes, and they will be furnished automatically.” 
(Numb. 31:6) “Then Moses sent them”: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in vs. 2), “’Take vengeance,’ by yourself,” and he sent others? It was simply because he had been raised in Midian, he said, “It is not right for me to oppress those who have done good to me.” The proverb says, “Do not cast a stone into a cistern from which you have drunk water.” But some say that this is not the same Midian in which Moses was raised. As this one is next to Moab and it is [still] desolate until now. And why did He send Phinehas (instead of someone else)? He said, “Whoever has begun a commandment should finish it. [Phinehas] has (according to Numb. 25:11) ‘turned around My wrath’ and smote the Midianite woman. Let him finish the commandment [that he undertook].” (Numb. 31:6, cont.) “And the vessels of the sanctuary (<i>haqodesh</i>)”: This refers to the ark (and its contents), since it is stated (in Numb. 7:9), “because they (i.e., the Children of Kohath) had the service of the holy (<i>haqodesh</i>) objects, which they carried on the shoulder.” R. Johanan said, “These were the priestly garments, in which were the <i>urim</i> and <i>thummim</i>, as stated (in Exod. 29:29), ‘And the sacred (<i>haqodesh</i>) garments of Aaron.’” (Numb. 31:7-8) “And they gather the army against Midian […. …] and they killed [Balaam ben Beor] with the sword”: Now what was he doing there? He had simply gone to receive a reward for the twenty-four thousand from Israel that had fallen through his counsel. And about him is it stated (in Prov. 26:27), “He who digs a pit will fall in it.” (Numb. 31:11-12) “Then they took all the plunder…. And they brought unto Moses and Elazar the Priest”: [This text serves] to show their excellence, for they did not want to take the spoils without permission. Rather they had brought all of it before them; and [only] after that, they took [them with his permission]. (Numb. 31:13) “Then Moses, Elazar the Priest, and the princes of the congregation went out to meet them”: [This text serves] to show Moses' humility, for they all were disciples of his disciples.
Another interpretation (of Numb. 31:2) “Exact vengeance for the Children of Israel.” This text is related (to Job 36:7), “He does not withdraw His eyes from a righteous person […].” What is the meaning of “He does not withdraw His eyes from a righteous person (literally, withdraw from a righteous person his eyes)?” The Holy One, blessed be He, does not keep back from a righteous person what he wants to see with his eyes. [The text] teaches that Moses longed to see vengeance on the Midianites before he died, and [so] he requested from the Holy One, blessed be He, about it, that he should [see it] with his eyes. Thus it is stated concerning Moses (in Ps. 58:11), “A righteous person will rejoice when he sees vengeance,” i.e., vengeance on Midian; “he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked person,” i.e., of Balaam. Moses said to Phinehas and the warring men, “I know that Balaam the Wicked is there, as he went to collect his wage. Before the wolf comes to the flock, spread the trap for him. And if you see that that wicked man is doing magic and is flying in the air […], show him the diadem, upon which it is written (according to Exod. 28:36), ‘holy to the Lord.’ And [when] he shall [then] fall, kill him.” (Numb. 31:8) “And upon their [other] corpses they killed the kings of Midian,” as they were doing magic with Balaam and flying in the air; so they showed them the diadem and they fell upon their corpses. 
Our masters said “It is written about Joshua (in Josh. 1:5), ‘as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.’ So Joshua should have lived a hundred and twenty years like Moshe our teacher. And why were they shortened by ten years? Because at the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in Numb. 31:2), ‘Exact vengeance for the Children of Israel […],’ even though the announcement of [his] death was [also] announced, he did not delay the thing. Rather, he showed alacrity, [as stated] (in Numb. 31:6), ‘And Moses sent them.’ But Joshua did not do like this. When he came to war against thirty-one kings, he said, ‘If I kill them, I will die immediately, as happened to Moshe our teacher.’ What did he do? He began to stall in the war with them, as stated (in Josh. 11:18), ‘Joshua waged war with all those kings over a long period.’ [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘This is what you did? See that I will shorten your years by ten years.’ Solomon said (about this in Prov. 19:21), ‘Many thoughts are in the heart of a man, [but it is the counsel of the Lord that will stand].’”
(Numb. 32:1) “Now the Children of Reuben and the Children of Gad] had much livestock”: A legal teaching: Three gifts were created in the world. A person meriting one of them receives what is most desirable in the whole world. A person meriting wisdom has merited everything. A person meriting strength has merited everything. A person meriting wealth has merited everything. When? When they are gifts of the Heavens and come from the power of Torah. But human strength and wealth are nothing; for thus has Solomon stated (in Eccl. 9:11), “Again I saw that under the sun the race does not belong to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor even wealth to the discerning, nor even favor to the knowledgeable […].” Thus also has Jeremiah stated (in Jer. 9:22), “Thus says the Lord, ‘Let not the wise boast in their wisdom, nor the strong boast in their strength, nor the wealthy boast in their wealth.’” So these gifts, when they do not come from the Holy One, blessed be He, will finally be cut off from them. Our masters taught, “Two wise men arose in the world, one from Israel and one from the nations of the world. Ahitophel was from Israel, while Balaam was from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world. Two strong men arose in the world, one was from Israel and one from the nations of the world. Samson was from Israel, while Goliath was from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world. Two wealthy men arose in the world, Korah from Israel and Haman from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world. Why? Because their gift was not from the Holy One, blessed be He. Rather they grabbed it up for themselves. So also do you find with the Children of Gad and the Children of Reuben that they were very wealthy and had a lot of livestock. But they loved their money and resided outside the Land of Israel [as a result]. For that reason they were the first of the tribes to go into exile, as stated (in I Chron. 5:26), ‘and he carried them into exile, i.e., the Reubenites and the Gadites […].’ Who brought [the exile] upon them? [It happened] because they had separated themselves from their siblings for the sake of their livestock. And where is it shown? From what is written in the Torah (in Numb. 32:1), ‘Now the Children of Reuben [and the Children of Gad] had much livestock.’”
This is related to the verse (in Ps. 75:7), “For it is not from the east or from the west or from the wilderness that there comes an exaltation (<i>harim</i>) […].” What is the meaning of (Ps. 75:7) “For it is not from the east (rt.: <i>mts</i>') or from the west?” It is not from a person working hard by going out (rt.: <i>mts</i>') for trade and traveling from east to west and searching in wildernesses and on mountains (<i>harim</i>) that he becomes wealthy. Rather even if one sails away in ships to go from east to west and searches in wildernesses and on mountains (<i>harim</i>), he does not become wealthy. What is the meaning of (Ps. 75:7, cont.), “or from the wilderness that there comes an exaltation (<i>harim</i>)?” R. Abba of Rumania says, “Every use of <i>harim</i> in Scripture denotes mountains except for here, where it denotes exaltation. Thus one is not exalted from these things.” So what does the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He takes possessions (<i>nekhasim</i>) from one and gives them to another, as stated (in Ps. 75:7, cont.), “For God it is who gives judgment; He brings down one man, He lifts up another.” That is why they are called<i> nekhasim</i>, as they are covered (<i>nikhsim</i>) from one and revealed to another. And why is the name of [common coins] called <i>zuzim</i>? Because they move (<i>zazim</i>) from one and are given to another. [It is called] money (<i>mammon</i>), because what you count (<i>mah [she’atah] moneh</i>) is not anything. [It is called] coins (<i>ma’ot</i>), because they are something for a time (<i>mah le’et</i>). And one can expound [with these] expression[s of money]. And so did Hannah say (in I Sam. 2:6-7), “[…] The Lord makes poor and makes rich; He casts down, He also lifts high.” What is the meaning of, “He also (<i>af</i>) lifts high?” With the anger (<i>af</i>) that He bring upon one, He lifts up the other. A certain matron asked R. Jose ben Halafta, “In how many days did the Holy One, blessed be He, create His world? He said to her, “In six days, as stated (in Exod. 31:17), ‘for in six day the Lord made the heavens and the earth.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. R. 68:4; <i>PRK</i> 2:4; Lev. R. 8:1; Numb. R. 3:6.</i> She said to him, “And what has He been doing since that time?” He said to her, “He sits down and makes ladders [for] raising up one and putting down another. Hence it is stated (in Ps. 75:7), ‘For God it is who gives judgment; He brings down one man, He lifts up another.’” You yourself know that, when He wanted the Children of Gad and the Children of Reuben to become wealthy, He brought down the Midianites in front of Israel, so that the Children of Gad and the Children of Reuben would become wealthy. What is written above (in Numb. 31:9)? “Then the children of Israel took the women and children of the Midianites captive, [and all their cattle, all their livestock, and all their wealth they seized as plunder].” Then after that, it is written (in Numb. 32:1), “Now [the Children of Reuben and the Children of Gad] had much livestock.” See that He brought down the Midianites and raised up Israel, to fulfill that which is stated, (in Ps. 75:8), “For it is not from the east or from the west…, for it is God who judges; He brings down one man, He lifts up another.”
Another interpretation of "And much cattle" (Numbers 32:1). This is [the meaning of] that which is stated by the verse (Ecclesiastes 10:2), "A wise man’s heart is to his right," that is the good impulse; "but a fool’s heart is to his left," that is the evil impulse. Another interpretation: "A wise man’s heart is to his right," that is the righteous who put their hearts to Torah which is from the right, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 33:2), “from His right, a fiery law to them; "but a fool’s heart is to his left," that is the evildoers who put their hearts to becoming rich, as it is stated (Proverbs 3:16), “in her left, riches and honor.” Another interpretation: "A wise man’s heart is to his right," that is Moshe; "but a fool’s heart is to his left," that is the Children of Reuven and the Children of Gad, who made the essential, secondary, and the secondary, essential. Why? Because they loved their possessions more than the [human] souls. As they said to Moshe (Numbers 32:16), "'We will build here sheepfolds for our flocks, and towns for our children.'" Moshe said to them, "This is nothing; rather make the essential, essential. First 'build towns for your children,' and afterwards 'sheepfolds for your flocks' (Numbers 32:24)." Hence, "A wise man’s heart is to his right," that is Moshe; "but a fool’s heart is to his left," that is the Children of Reuven and the Children of Gad. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, "You loved your money more than [your] souls. By your lives, there is no blessing in this, as stated (Proverbs 20:21), 'An estate acquired in haste at the outset will not be blessed in the end.'" And it likewise states (Proverbs 23:4), "Do not toil to gain wealth; have the sense to desist." And who is wealthy? One who is happy with his lot, as stated (in Psalms 128:2), "You shall eat the produce of your hands; you shall be happy, and it shall go well with you."

Chapter 23

1 A legal teaching: When a person is being pursued by foreign [troops] and brigands,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>lestai.</i></i> is it permissible for such a one to profane the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught: When a person is being pursued by [foreign] troops and brigands, such a one does profane the Sabbath to save his life.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>RH</i> 2:5; ‘<i>Eruv</i> 45a; <i>Ta‘an</i>. 14a.</i> We therefore find in the case of David, that when Saul sought to kill him, he fled from him and was saved.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to <i>Men</i>. 95b, David’s eating of the consecrated bread (I Sam. 21:7) on the day of his flight (vs. 11) took place on the Sabbath.</i> Our masters have said, “There is a story about a time when evil documents came from the empire for the leading citizens of SepphorIs (on the Sabbath). [The citizens] came to R. Eliezer ben Parta [and] said to him, ‘Evil documents have come to us from the empire. What do you say? Shall we flee?’ Since he was afraid to tell them to flee, he hinted to them saying, ‘Are you asking me? Go and ask Jacob, Moses, and David.’” With reference to Jacob, it is written (in Hos. 12:13), “Then Jacob fled.” With reference to Moses, it is written (in Exod. 2:15), “but Moses fled.” With reference to David, it is written (in I Sam. 19:18) “Now David fled and escaped.” It also says (in Is. 26:20), “Go, My people, enter your chambers […].” The Holy One, blessed be he, said to them, “Though all the greats of the world feared and fled from their enemies, I did not let you flee all of those forty years that you did in the wilderness. Rather I would bring down your enemies in front of you, since I was with you. Moreover, how many snakes and scorpions did I exterminate for your sake, as stated (in Deut. 8:15), ‘[through the great and terrible wilderness with its] fiery serpents and scorpions,’ and I did not let them hurt you.” Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Write down the stages by which Israel journeyed in the wilderness, so that they will know how many miracles I performed for them during each and every stage.” Where is it shown? From what we read on the matter (in Numb. 33:1), “These are the stages.”

5 (Numb. 34:1–2) “Then the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying, ‘Command the Children of Israel [and say unto them], “When you come into the Land of Canaan, this is the land [...].”’”: [“This is the land”]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These words occur also in Deut. 34:4 (cited below). The midrash, therefore, interprets the two passages together. What follows in Numb. 34:3ff. describes what Israel is about to receive, while Deut. 34:4 (cited below) speaks of the promise to Israel’s future seed and adds that Moses shall see it.</i> teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moses all that had been and all that was going to be. He showed him Samson arising from Dan, and Barak ben Avinoam [arising] from Naphtali. So also it was for every generation with its expounders, every generation with its judges, every generation with its leaders, every generation with its sages, every generation with its sinners, every generation with its righteous, as stated (in Deut. 34:4,) “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob [...].” [This] teaches that He showed him <i>gehinnom</i>. Moses said in front of Him, “Master of the world, who is sentenced to it?” He said to him, “The wicked and those that rebel against Me, as stated (in Is. 66:24), “And they went out and saw the corpses of the people....” Moses began to fear. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (as in Deut. 34:4), “I have shown it to your eyes, but you will not pass there.” And what is the meaning of, “This is the land […] saying?” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “Go and tell them – Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – that the oath that I swore to them I have fulfilled for their children.” It is therefore stated (in Deut. 34:4), “saying.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew here can imply the giving of one’s solemn word.</i> 
6 (Numb. 34:2) “This is the land that shall fall to you as your portion”: And does the land fall? But is it not written (in Eccl. 1:4), “but the land stands forever?” It is simply that when the spies came and put out slander on the land, Moses got angry. [Then] all of Israel said, “Moses, our teacher, if these spies were two [or] three, it would be correct for us to trust [them], as stated (Deut. 17:6), ‘By the testimony of two or three witnesses.’ And behold, they are ten, (as in Deut. 1:28), ‘To where shall we go up; our kinsmen have taken the heart out of us, saying, “We saw there a people stronger and taller than we.”’” As it were, [they were complaining that] the Master of the house is not able to remove his vessels (the inhabitants) from there. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He took the ministering angel of the land and bound him and put him down in front of them, as stated (Deut. 1:21), “See the Lord, your God, has placed in front of you....” And was [the land] in front of them? It is simply that He put down its ministering angel. And He said to them (in Deut. 1:21, cont.), “Go up and possess..., do not fear and do not tremble,” not from the Nephilim and not from the numerous people. (Ezek. 45:1) “When you allot the land as an inheritance....”: This text is related (to Ps. 16:6), “Portions of land fell to me in pleasantness, even a beautiful inheritance for me.” “Portions of land fell to me”: These are the twelve tribes, since the land was divided to the twelve tribes, as stated (in Ezek. 47:13), “Thus said the Lord God, ‘These shall be the boundaries of the land that you shall allot to the twelve tribes of Israel.’” “In pleasantness,” in the merit of the Torah, about which it is stated (in Prov. 22:18), “As it is pleasant that you should store them in your belly [...].” There is a man who is handsome but his clothing is ugly, and one who is ugly but his clothing handsome. But [regarding] Israel, they adorn the land and the Land adorns them. Hence it is stated (in Ps. 16:6), “Even a beautiful inheritance for me.” And so too is it stated (in Job 29:14), “I clothed myself in righteousness and it clothed me.” It is written (in Josh. 7:19), “Then Joshua said unto Achan, ‘My son, please give glory to the Lord God of Israel [and make a confession to Him; please tell me what you have done, do not hide it from me.]’” Achan said to him, “Am I to die because of this thing that you are saying?” When Achan saw [the situation], he said in his heart, “Now I shall be entrapped by the lot. Then I shall be found untrue (rt.: '<i>mn</i>) and deemed a liar before Joshua.” At that moment Achan said to Joshua, “Why are you casting lots between me and my house? Let me cast lots between you and Phinehas! If the lot does not come up for both of you, I also shall believe (rt.: '<i>mn</i>) [in it].” At that moment (according to Josh. 7:19) Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please give glory to the Lord God of Israel and make a confession to Him. Please tell me what you have done.” Achan said to him, “You also tell me what you have done.” Immediately discord broke out in Israel, so that [Achan's] tribe of Judah arose in strife and killed one group in Israel after another. When Achan saw this, he said in his heart, “If anyone saves a single life in Israel, it is as though he had saved the entire world; yet in my case, it has been through me that several people in Israel have been killed. I am a sinner and one who causes [others] to sin. It is better [for me] to confess my transgression before the Holy One, blessed be He, and before Joshua, so that no calamity come about through me.” What did Achan do? He arose and made his voice heard, so that the whole congregation turned to him. He said to Joshua (in vs. 20), “’(Truly) I am the one who sinned before the Lord God of Israel; thus and so (literally, like this and like this) is what I have done.’ So it was not this alone, but I have already misappropriated other [things].”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Gen. R. 85:14, according to which Achan had acted dishonestly in the person of his great grandfather, Zerah, the son of Judah by Tamar.</i> Joshua said to him, “Indeed I also knew that you were responsible for the situation; (Josh. 7:19,) ‘please tell me what you have done. Do not hide it from me.’” (Vs. 21) “I saw among the spoils”: [He said,] “I have seen what is written in the Torah (in Deut. 20:14), ‘you may eat the spoils of your enemies.’” (Josh. 7:21, cont.) “A fine <i>shinar</i> mantle”: [He continued,] “Now do not say that I am poor and in need, for there is no one in the tribe [of Judah] wealthier than I. Immediately (there follows vs. 22), “Then Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent and behold buried in his tent was the silver […].” For what reason did Joshua send them? So that the tribe of Judah would not steal them (i.e., the stolen articles) and continue in the discord. Joshua therefore sent quickly, and (according to vs. 23) “they brought them unto Joshua and unto all the Children of Israel; and they spread them out before the Lord.” What is the significance of “and they spread them out?” Joshua said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, is it because of these that You have been angry with Your children? Here they are set before you.” Immediately [we read] (in vs. 24), “Then Joshua took Achan ben Zerah, the silver, the mantle, and the wedge of gold, together with his sons and his daughters,” [the latter] in order to teach them a lesson; “his ox, his ass, […] and his tent,” for burning. (Vs. 24, cont.) “And all Israel [Joshua took] with him,” to see his punishment so that they would not become accustomed to acting in this way. (Vs. 24, cont.) “And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor (<i>akhor</i>; rt.: '<i>kr</i>).” (Vs. 25) “Then Joshua said, ‘Just as you have afflicted (rt.: '<i>kr</i>) us, [may the Lord afflict (rt.: '<i>kr</i>) you] this day:’”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Without the bracketed words, the verse would read: HOW YOU HAVE AFFLICTED US THIS DAY!</i> This day [only] is he to be afflicted ('<i>akhur</i>; rt.: '<i>kr</i>), but he will have a share in the world to come. (Vs. 25, cont.) “Then all Israel pelted him with stones,” him alone; “and they burned them with fire”: The text is speaking of his wealth, for so it had been told [Joshua] by the Almighty (in vs. 15), “And it shall come to pass that the one who has been seized with what has been proscribed shall be burned with fire....” If so, what do we learn from the verse (vs. 15, cont.), “him, and all that he has?” [This passage] is only to teach you that Achan had confessed that he had stolen them on the Sabbath, when he took them out of Jericho and buried them in the midst of his tent. Thus he was stoned for profaning the Sabbath and burned because he had transgressed the ban. And where is it shown? You find that the Holy One, blessed be He, said so to Joshua (in Josh. 6:2–4), “See, I have given Jericho into your hands, along with its king and the mighty warriors. So you shall go around the city with all the men of war to encompass the city one time, thus shall you do for six days. [… but on the seventh day you shall go around the city seven times].” [This passage serves] to teach you that Jericho was conquered on the Sabbath. Now Joshua did this thing on his own, and the Holy One, blessed be He, gave his consent. Joshua said (to himself), “The Sabbath is holy, as stated (in Exod. 31:14), ‘You shall keep the Sabbath, because it is holy for you.’ And whatever we conquer shall be holy.” It is so stated (in Josh. 6:19), “But all the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and iron, are holy to the Lord.” And where is it shown that he received consent? Where it is stated (in Josh. 6:17), “The city and everything in it are to be proscribed for the Lord.” At that time (according to Josh. 7:26) “the Lord turned from His burning anger.” Concerning [this matter], it is stated (in Prov. 16:14), “The king's anger is like messengers of death, and whoever is wise will appease it.” This refers to Joshua, who caused the burning anger of the Lord to turn away from Israel.
7 (Numb. 34:2) “When you come into the land of Canaan”: A legal teaching: Before Israel entered the land, how did they say the blessing over the food? Thus have our masters taught: Before they entered the land, they used to only say a single blessing, “<i>who sustains all</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Philip Birnbaum, <i>Daily Prayer Book</i> (Hebrew Publishing Co., 1949), p. 759/760.</i> After they had entered the land, they ordained the blessing, “<i>for the land and for the food</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Birnbaum, p. 763/764.</i> After Jerusalem was destroyed, they added “<i>builder of Jerusalem</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See Birnbaum, p. 765/766. The prayer also occurs as the fourteenth blessing in the <i>Shemoneh</i> ‘<i>Esreh</i> (Birnbaum, p. 89/90), as well as in other contexts. For the various versions of the prayer, see Joseph Heinemann, <i>Prayer in the Talmud,</i> trans. Richard S. Sarason (“Studia Judaica, IX; Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1977), pp. 48-50, 70-76.</i> After those slain at Bethther<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">During the Bar Cochba war, 132-135.</i> were buried, they added “<i>who is good and does what is good</i>.”<i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Birnbaum, p. 765/766.</i></i> “<i>Who is good,</i>” because they did not decay; and “<i>who does what is good,</i>” because they were given burials. None of them, however, is more dear to you than the blessing of the land. The sages [therefore] said, “Whoever does not mention ‘<i>for the land and for the food</i>; <i>a desirable, good, and spacious land;</i> the covenant [of circumcision]; Torah; life; and food’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>A Desirable, Good, and Spacious Land</i> plus the elements that follow all form part of a single prayer to be found in Birnbaum, p. 761/762.</i> has not satisfied his obligation.”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Ber.</i> 48b-49a.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “The land of Israel is more dear to Me than everything. I am the one who sought it out, as stated (in Ezek. 20:6), ‘On that day I swore (literally, raised My hand) to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt unto a land which I had sought out for them […].’” And similarly it states (in Jer. 3:19), “And I gave you a desirable land – the fairest heritage of all the nations.” You find [the same love for the land], when Joshua slew those kings. R. Jannay the Priest said, “There were sixty-two kings, thirty-one at Jericho and thirty one in the days of Sisera. When he went to fight with Israel they also were slain along with him. Why? Because they yearned to drink water from the waters of Israel. They made a request of Sisera and said to him, ‘If you please, let us come with you to war.’ And every king that requested to go to war sent and hired other workers with silver, so that they would help him. They said to Sisera, ‘We do not request anything from you, but rather we will come for free, because we yearn to fill our stomachs with water from that land.’ Thus it is stated (in Jud. 5:19), ‘The kings came, they fought; [...] on account of<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Heb.: ‘<i>al.</i> The more usual translation here is BY.</i> the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of silver.’ [This verse serves] to inform you that nothing was more beloved than the land of Israel.” The Holy One, blessed be He, had said to Moses, “This land is dear to Me, as stated (in Deut. 11:12), ‘A land for which the Lord your God always cares.’ Israel also is dear to Me, as stated (in Deut. 7:8), ‘Because the Lord loves you….’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I will bring Israel, who are beloved to Me, into a land that is beloved to Me, as stated (in Numb. 34:2), “when you come into the land of Canaan.”

9 (Numb. 34:2) “When you come into the land”: (Numb. 33:52) “You shall dispossess all the inhabitants of the land from before you.” This text is related (to Job 35:11), “Who teaches us through the beasts of earth [...].”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the verse in this sense, although a more usual translation WOULD BE WHO TEACHES US MORE THAN THE BEASTS OF THE EARTH.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Learn from the bull of Elijah; for in the hour that (in I Kings 18:25) ‘Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves and prepare it first,”’ at that very hour the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred (and fifty) prophets of Asherah gathered together and were unable to budge its foot from the ground.” Look at what is written there (in vs. 23), “Let them give us two bulls […].” What did Elijah do? He said to them, “Choose two bulls for yourselves, twins from the same mother, who grew up in the same pasture, and cast lots over them, one for the name (i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He,) and one for the name of Baal.” And [so] they choose one bull for themselves. Now Elijah's immediately followed him; but as for that bull which had been assigned to the name of Baal, all those prophets of Baal plus the prophets of Asherah assembled to move [even] its foot from the ground, and were unable to do so, until Elijah began to say [to it] for them, “Go with them.” The bull answered and spoke to Elijah before the eyes of all the people and said to him, “My colleague and I came out of the same womb, out of the same mother, and we grew up in the same pasture. That one was assigned to the portion of the Holy One, blessed be He, and the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is sanctified through him. So have I been assigned to the portion of Baal to provoke my Creator?” Elijah said to him, “Bull, bull, go with them and do not let them find an excuse. Just as the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is being sanctified through this one with me, so will it be sanctified through you.” He said to him, “Now that you have given me this advice, I swear that I will not move from here until you deliver me into their hand.” Thus it is stated (in vs. 26), “and they took the bull that he gave to them.” And who gave it to them? Elijah. You also learn that Elijah said to them (in vs. 23), “Let them give us two bulls,” and he also said to them (in vs. 25), “Choose one bull for yourselves.” Then at the end [of the verse] is written (ibid. cont.), “and they took the bull which he had given them.” It is therefore stated (in Job 35:11), “Who teaches us through the beasts of [the] earth.” (Ibid., cont.) “And He makes us wise through the birds of the heavens:”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the verse in this sense, although a more usual translation would be AND HE MAKES US WISER THAN THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Learn [a lesson] from the ravens who fed Elijah, of whom it is stated (in I Kings 17:4), ‘and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.’ From where did they bring him [it]? From Jehoshaphat's table, because those ravens did not want to enter Ahab's house to take anything from his table for this righteous man. [They would not go there] because his house was full of idolatry.” Ergo (in Job 35:11), “He makes us wise through the birds of the heavens.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Learn from the bull pf Elijah and from the ravens, and do not turn unto idols to look at them.” Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 33:52), “You shall dispossess all the inhabitants of the land.”
10 (Numb. 34:2) “When you come into the land of Canaan”: This text is related (to Jer. 2:31), “You, O generation, understand the word of the Lord! Have I been a desert (<i>hmdbr</i>, voweled as (<i>hamidbar</i>) to Israel…?” Do not read “a desert,” but “I was the Speaker (<i>hmdbr</i>, voweled as <i>hamedabber</i>)” to Israel. (Ibid., cont.) “[Or a land] of utter darkness (<i>ma'pelyah</i>)”: What is the meaning of “<i>ma'pelyah</i> (rt.: '<i>pl</i>)?” Did I, perhaps, promise you to bring you into the land and [then] delay you? After all, <i>ma'pelyah</i> can only mean "delay," as stated (in Exod. 9:32), “But the wheat and the spelt were not hurt [because they ripen late] (i.e., are delayed, rt.: '<i>pl</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Numb. 1:2.</i> See, you will be entering into its midst, “When (according to Numb. 34:2) you come into the land of Canaan (<i>kena'an</i>).” What is the meaning of (<i>kena'an</i>? A land of business,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>pragmateia.</i></i> a land of trade. [The usage is] just as you say (in Is. 23:8 with reference to Tyre), “[…] whose traders (<i>kena'anim</i>)<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Here the word usually translated CANAAN (<i>Kena‘an</i>) occurs in the sense of trader, as in Hos. 12:8.</i> the world honored.”
11 (Numb. 34:2) “This is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance”: What is the meaning of “to you?” To you it is fitting. [The matter] is comparable to a king who had male and female slaves and would have his male slaves marry female slaves from another estate and his female slaves [marry] male salves from a different estate.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>ousia.</i> Although this word commonly means “substance” or “essence,” it also came to mean “estate,” at least from Ptolemaic times. See James Hope Moulton and George Milligan, <i>The Vocabulary of the Greek Testament Illustrated from the Papyri and Other Non-Literary Sources</i> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1960)</i> The king stopped and reflected. He said, “The male slaves are mine and the female slaves are mine. It would be better for me to marry my male slaves ('<i>avadim</i>) to my female slaves, my own to my own.” Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “The land is Mine, as stated (in Ps. 24:1), ‘The land is the Lord's and all that is in it.’ And it states (in Lev. 25:23), “for the land is Mine.” Moreover Israel is Mine, as stated (in Lev. 25:55), ‘For to Me the Children of Israel are servants ('<i>avadim</i>).’ [It is] better for Me to bequeath My land to my servants who belong to Me, My own to My own.” It is therefore stated (in Numb. 34:2), “this is the land that shall fall to you.” 
12 This text is related (to Ps. 111:6), “He revealed to His people His powerful works.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “I could have created a different land for you. But in order to show you My strength, I am expelling your enemies in front of you and giving you their land, to fulfill that which is stated, ‘He revealed His powerful works [...].’”
13 (Numb. 35:11) “You shall provide yourselves with cities [to be cities of refuge, where a killer may flee who has taken a life by mistake]”: This text is related (to Ps. 25:8), “The Lord is good and straightforward; therefore He instructs sinners in the way.” (Ibid., vs. 6) “Be mindful of Your mercies, O Lord”: David said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, were it not for Your mercies, which took precedence for the first Adam, he would not have survived. Although You said to him (in Gen. 2:17), ‘For on the day that you eat from it, you shall surely die,’ You did not act in that way. Instead You excluded him from the Garden of Eden and he lived nine hundred and thirty years, and then he died. What did You do to him? You drove him out of the Garden of Eden, as stated (in Gen. 3:24), ‘So He drove out the man.’ So why was he driven out? Because he had brought death to [all future] generations. He should have died immediately; but because You were merciful to him, You [simply] drove him out. It is the same with one who kills by mistake, when he goes into exile into the cities of refuge.” It is therefore stated (in Ps. 25:6), “Be mindful of Your mercies, O Lord, and of Your steadfast love….” When Moses arose, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to [him] (in Numb. 35:11), “You shall provide yourselves with cities [to be cities of refuge].” Moses said, “Master of the world, when someone takes a life by mistake in the south or in the north, how will he know where the cities of refuge are, that he should flee to it?” He said to him (in Deut. 19:3), “’You yourself shall prepare (rt.: <i>tkn</i>) the road (<i>derekh</i>).’ You yourself shall make the roads [to these cities] straight (rt.: <i>tkn</i>), so that [anyone fleeing to them] will not go astray for the blood avenger to find him and kill him, when (according to Deut 19:6) ‘he did not incur the death penalty.’” He further said to him, “How?” He said to him, “Erect road markers<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>stelai</i>; Lat.: <i>stelae.</i></i> directing (rt.: <i>tkn</i>) [such a refugee] to the cities of refuge, so that he will know how to go there; and on every marker inscribe, ‘[Involuntary] killers to the cities of refuge,’ as stated (in Deut. 19:3), ‘You yourself shall prepare (rt.: <i>tkn</i>) the road (<i>derekh</i>).’” Thus David has said (in Ps. 25:8), “The Lord is good and straightforward; therefore He instructs sinners in the way (<i>derekh</i>).” [Now] if for killers He has made a way and a road (<i>derekh</i>; rt.: <i>drk</i>), for them to flee and escape death), how much the more so in the case of the righteous. (Ps. 25:9) “He leads (rt.: <i>drk</i>) the lowly in justice […].” (Numb. 35:11) “Where a killer may flee who has taken a life by mistake”: [“By mistake,”] and not on purpose. If someone goes and kills on purpose, then says, “It was by mistake that I killed,” and flees to [one of the] cities of refuge, the Holy One, blessed be He, says, “Even if he comes in and flees to My altar, kill him, according to what is stated (in Exod. 21:14), ‘But when someone plots against his companion, etc.’” Who was this person who fled to the altar and was killed? This was Joab, of whom it is stated (in I Kings 2:28), “When the news came to Joab, … [Joab fled] unto the tent of the Lord [and seized the horns of the altar].” [Yet Joab was a great sage and the head of the Sanhedrin, as stated] (in II Sam. 23:8), “one who sits in the seat of wisdom.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">These words are commonly understood as the proper name, JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH, A TAHCHEMONITE, but this and other citations of the verse in rabbinic literature tend to understand the verse as translated here. See <i>Tanh.</i> (Buber), Gen. 4:12; also <i>Tanh.</i> (<i>Buber</i>), Deut. 1:3. Cf. <i>MQ</i> 26b, for an interpretation that identifies this sage with David himself.</i> [So] did he not know what is written in the Torah (in Exod. 21:14), “But when someone plots against his companion [and kills him treacherously, you shall take him away (even) from my altar for execution,” that he went and seized the horns of the altar?<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yMakk.</i> 2:7 [6] (31d); <i>Sanh.</i> 48b; see <i>Makk.</i> 12b.</i> It is simply that [Joab] had said, “Those killed by a court of law are not buried in the graves of their ancestors but by themselves. It is better to die here, so that I may be buried with my ancestors.” (I Kings 2:30–31) “Then Benaiah brought back word unto the king [...]: So the king said to him, ‘Do as he has spoken, strike him down and bury him.’” Why was he killed? Because his (Solomon's) father, David, had ordered him [to do] so (in I Kings 2:5), “Moreover, you also know what Joab ben Zeruiah did to me […].” What did he do to him? You find that, when David wrote to Joab (in II Sam. 11:15), “Set Uriah in the front line [where the fighting is the fiercest]...,” he did so, and [Uriah] was killed. All the army leaders assembled against Joab, as [Uriah] was the head of the warriors, as stated of him (in II Sam. 23:39), “Uriah the Hittite, [was one of] all thirty-seven [leaders].” He showed them the document. It is therefore stated (in I Kings 2:5), “What Joab ben Zeruiah did to me.” (I Kings 2:5, cont.) “And what he did [to the two commanders of Israel's forces, to Abner ben Ner and to Amasa ben Jether, he killed them].” All of Israel had been of the opinion that David had ordered him to kill [Abner] because Abner was Saul's cousin. Therefore it is written (in II Sam. 3:29), “may the house of Joab never lack [one with a discharge, a leper.” David arose and cursed Joab. Then all Israel was appeased,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Rt.: <i>PYS.</i> Cf. Gk.: <i>peisai</i> (“to have persuaded”).</i> when they knew that there was no [authorization] from David. So David ordered his son, Solomon, to kill him, because Joab was the son of David's sister, and he sought to approach him to the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">If he received punishment in this world, his deed would no longer bar him from doing so.</i> When Solomon sought to kill him, Joab said to Benaiah, “Go and tell Solomon, ‘Do not sentence me with two judgments. If you are killing me, take off from me the curses with which your father, David, cursed me; and if not, leave me with his curses.’” Immediately (in I Kings 2:31), “So the king said to him, ‘Do as he has spoken, strike him down and bury him.” R. Judah has said, “All curses with which David cursed Joab were all fulfilled in David's seed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>yQid.</i> 1:7 (61a); cf. above, Gen. 7:7; ‘<i>Arakh</i>. 16a.</i> One with a discharge [was fulfilled in] Rehoboam ben Solomon (according to I Kings 12:18 = II Chron. 10:18), “then King Rehoboam succeeded in mounting his chariot (<i>merkavah</i>).” It also says concerning one with a discharge (in Lev. 15:9), “And any saddle (<i>merkav</i>) on which the one with a discharge rides shall be unclean.” A leper [was fulfilled in] Uzziah, of whom it is stated (in II Kings 15:5), “and he was a leper until the day of his death […].” One who grasps the crutch [was fulfilled in] Asa, of whom it is written (in I Kings 15:23), “however in his old age he became diseased in his feet,” as gout<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>podagra</i>; Lat.: <i>podagra.</i></i> had seized him. One who falls by the sword [was fulfilled in] Josiah, of whom it is written (in II Chron. 35:23), “Then the archers shot King Josiah.” Moreover, Rav Judah has said that Rav said, “They thrust iron lances<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Gk.: <i>longchai.</i></i> into him, until they had [perforated] him like a sieve.” And one lacking bread [was fulfilled in] Jehoiachin, of whom it is stated (in II Kings 25:30 = Jer. 52:34), “And for his food allowance a regular food allowance was given to him from the king, from the table of Evil-Merodach.” You also find that as long as Jehoiada lived, Joash did the will of his Creator, as stated (in II Kings 12:3 // II Chron. 24:2), “And Jehoash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord all his days as the priest Jehoiada instructed him.” (II Chron. 24:17) “Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and bowed low to the king, and the king hearkened unto them,” in that he took it upon himself to make an idol. Therefore (according to vs. 24), “they inflicted judgments on Joash.” Now for what was Abner punished? It was because he had made light and an amusement (rt.: <i>shq</i>), the blood of the young men, as stated (in II Sam. 2:14), “Then Abner said unto Joab, ‘Please let the young men arise and play (rt.: <i>shq</i>) before us, etc.’”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The result of their “playing” was that they all killed each other.</i> R. Joshua ben Levi said it was because he put his name before the name of David, as stated (in II Sam. 3:12), “Then Abner sent messengers unto David where he was, saying, ‘To whom does the land belong?’” But the sages say, “It was because he did not let Saul be reconciled with David; and he had the power to protest [the massacre] at Nob, the city of priests, but did not protest.”
14 (Numb. 35:11) “You shall provide yourselves with cities”: And it is written (in Numb. 35:13-14), “six cities of refuge shall there be for you. The three cities.” The three in the Land of Israel were in the West; and the three were across the Jordan in the East [in the Land of] the Children of Reuben, of the Children of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh, as stated (in Deut. 4:43), “Bezer, in the desert [...].” R. Johanan said, (ibid.,) “’Bezer, in the desert [...],’ see, there were three in the East. And the three in the West were in Hevron of Judah, and Shechem of Ephraim, which is Napolin (Nablus), and Kadesh in the Galilee from the tribe of Naphtali.” Moses apportioned [land] for the Reubenites, the Gadites and for the half tribe of Manasseh, and he set aside three cities from them, as stated (in Deut. 4:41), “Then Moses set aside three cities.” But Joshua apportioned [land] to all of the tribes, and gave forty-eight cities to the Levites; the priests took thirteen, and the rest went to the [other] Levites, and the three cities of refuge came into their lot. And the tribe of Levi did not take a portion in the land, as stated (Josh. 12:33), “But no [portion] was assigned by Moses to the tribe of Levi.” Why? [Because (as in Deut. 18:1),] “the Lord’s fire offerings and His portion shall they eat.” You find that Sennacherib exiled Israel in three exiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lam. R. Proem 5.</i> First, he exiled the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh. Second, [came] the tribe of Zebulon and the tribe of Naphtali, as stated (in Is. 8:23), “in the former time he abased the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali.” Third, he exiled the rest of the tribes, as stated (ibid., cont.), “and later he afflicted (<i>hikhbid</i>).”<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Translations of this verse vary, but the translation given here fits the sense of the midrash.</i> He swept (<i>hikhbid</i>) them as [with] a broom (<i>makhbed</i>). Nebuchadnezzar also carried out three exiles with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. In the first he exiled Jehoiakim [and] in the second, Jehoiachin. What did he do? He bound him in his carriage<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Lat.: <i>carruca</i>; Gk.: <i>karrouchion.</i></i> and [there] he became dear to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Buber suggests a translation such as, “and it was his favorite.”</i> Thus it is stated, “Behold, I am sending you away like a queen mother.”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The text is not in Scripture, but cf.

From where do we know that Nebuchadnezzar was a world emperor? As he exiled these to here and those to there, and he exiled Israel to Babylon, and those in Babylon to the Land of Israel. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world Israel has gone into exile and spread among the gates of the world, because of iniquities; but in the future to come (according to Deut. 30:4), “If your banishment is to the end of the heavens, from there will the Lord your God gather you, even from there will He bring you back.” It also says (in Is. 11:12), “and he shall gather the dispersed of Judah […].” And it says (in Is. 31:11), “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing. Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, while sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”
