Shemot Rabbah



Chapter 1

<b>“These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his household” (Exodus 1:1).</b> <br>That is what is written: “He who spares his rod hates his son, and he who loves him seeks for him admonition” (Proverbs 13:24). The way of the world is that a person whom another tells him: ‘So-and-so struck your son,’ he would harass him. What is the meaning when the verse states: “He who spares his rod hates his son”? It is to teach you that anyone who withholds rebuke from his son, his son will ultimately set out on a path of depravity and he will hate him. <br>As we find regarding Ishmael, who was beloved<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, he had longings for his father, which could explain his father’s love for him.</i> by his father Abraham, who did not chasten him, and he set out on a path of depravity. He then hated him and expelled him from his home emptyhanded. What did Ishmael do? When he was fifteen years old, he began to bring an idol from the marketplace, and he played with it and worshipped it in the manner that he saw others doing.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although he made it look like he was just playing with it and even mocking it, in fact his intention was to worship it.</i> Immediately, “Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she bore to Abraham, playing [<i>metzaḥek</i>]” (Genesis 21:9), and <i>metzaḥek</i> means nothing other than idol worship, like you say: “They rose to carouse [<i>letzaḥek</i>]” (Exodus 32:6). <sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is written in the context of the sin of the Golden Calf.</i> <br>Immediately, “She said to Abraham: Expel this maidservant and her son” (Genesis 21:10), so that my son will not learn his ways. Immediately, “the matter was very troubling in the eyes of Abraham regarding his son” (Genesis 21:11), because he emerged to a path of depravity. “God said to Abraham: Let it not be troubling in your eyes about the lad…everything that Sarah says to you, heed her voice” (Genesis 21:12). From here you learn that Abraham was subordinate to Sarah in prophecy. Immediately, “Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water…” (Genesis 21:14), teaching you that he hated Ishmael because he set out on a path of depravity, and sent him and his mother Hagar emptyhanded, and for that reason expelled him from his home. <br>Is it conceivable that Abraham, in whose regard it is written: “Abram was very wealthy in livestock, in silver, and in gold” (Genesis 13:2), would send his wife and his son from his house emptyhanded, without garments and without sustenance? Rather, it is to teach you that once he [Ishmael] set out on the path of depravity, he [Abraham] paid no attention to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Consequently the verse states that he gave them bread and water, implying that he did not give them other means of support. </i> What ultimately became of him? When he banished him, he sat at the crossroads and would rob people, as it is stated: “He will be a wild man” (Genesis 16:12). <br>Similarly, “Isaac loved Esau” (Genesis 25:28); therefore he set out on a path of depravity, because he did not chasten him, as we learned: The wicked Esau violated five transgressions on that day. He consorted with a betrothed young woman, killed a person, denied the revival of the dead, denied the principle [of belief in God], and scorned the birthright. In addition, he desired the death of his father and sought to kill his brother, as it is stated: “Let the days of mourning for my father approach and I will kill Jacob my brother” (Genesis 27:41), and he caused Jacob to flee from his fathers. <br>And he [Esau] too went to Ishmael to learn from him the path of depravity and to add to his wives, as it is stated; “Esau went to Ishmael, [and took Maḥalat the daughter of Ishmael…in addition to his wives, as his wife]” (Genesis 28:9). <br>Similarly, David did not chastise Avshalom and did not chasten him, [and Avshalom] set out on the path of depravity. He sought to kill his father, he lay with his [father’s] concubines, and forced him to walk barefoot, weeping; and thousands and tens of thousands from Israel fell. In addition, he caused him endless hardships, as it is written: “A psalm by David when he fled from Avshalom, etc.” (Psalms 3:1). What is written afterward? “Lord, how numerous are my tormentors, etc.” (Psalms 3:2). The path of depravity<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A wayward child</i> in a person’s household is worse than the war of Gog and Magog, as regarding Gog and Magog it is written: “Why do nations rage and peoples meditate in vain?” (Psalms 2:1), and there it is written: “Lord, how numerous are my tormentors.” <br>David acted similarly with Adoniya, as he did not chasten him with chastisement and he did not scold him; therefore, he set out on the path of depravity, as it is written: “His father never distressed him, [saying: Why did you do so? …and she bore him after Avshalom]” (I Kings 1:6). But wasn’t Avshalom the son of Maakha, and Adoniyahu the son of Ḥaggit? What is: “And she bore him after Avshalom”? Rather, because [Avshalom] set out on the path of depravity because his father did not chasten him, and in Adoniyahu’s regard, it is written: “His father never distressed him,” he, too, set out on the path to depravity. Therefore, it is written: “And she bore him after Avshalom.” <br> “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition” (Proverbs 13:24); this is the Holy One blessed be He. It is because he loves Israel, as it is written: “I have loved you, said the Lord” (Malachi 1:2) that he promotes them through suffering. You find three excellent gifts that the Holy One blessed be He gave to Israel, and he gave them all to them by means of suffering: The Torah, the Land of Israel, and life in the World to Come. The Torah, as it is written: “Happy is the man whom You afflict, Lord, whom You teach from Your Torah” (Psalms 94:12). The Land of Israel, as it is written: “For you know in your heart [that as a man rebukes his son, so the Lord your God rebukes you]” (Deuteronomy<i> </i>8:5); what is written after it: “For the Lord your God will bring you [to a good land]” (Deuteronomy<i> </i>8:7). The World to Come, as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light, [and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life]”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This indicates that the way to merit everlasting life is through reproof, which involves suffering. </i> (Proverbs<i> </i>6:23). <br>Anyone who chastises his son, the son adds love for his father and he honors him, as it is stated: “Admonish your son, and he will give you rest [and provide delights to your soul]” (Proverbs 29:17), and it is stated: “Admonish your son, as there is hope” (Proverbs 19:18). And he adds love for him, as it is stated: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition” – because he sought for him admonition, therefore he loves him. <br>You find that Abraham chastised his son Isaac, taught him Torah, and guided him in his path, as it is written in Abraham’s regard: “Because Abraham heeded My voice, [and kept My commission, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws]” (Genesis 26:5), and it is written: “And this is the legacy of Isaac, Abraham’s son: [Abraham begot Isaac]” (Genesis 25:19), to teach you that he was similar to his father in every sense; in beauty, wisdom, wealth, and good deeds. <br>Know [that Isaac internalized Abraham’s lessons and accepted his authority], for he was thirty-seven years old when his father bound him, and it is written: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years” (Genesis 24:1), and he bound him and tied him, and [Isaac] did not prevent [him from doing so]. Therefore, “Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac” (Genesis 25:5); that is: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition.” <br>Similarly, Isaac would seek admonition for Jacob, as he taught him Torah and chastised him in his study hall, as it is stated: “Jacob was a simple man, [a dweller in tents]” (Genesis 25:27). He learned what his father taught him and then he took his leave from his father and secluded himself in the house of Ever to study Torah. Therefore, he merited blessing and inherited the land, as it is stated: “Jacob settled in the land of his father's residence, in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 37:1). <br>Jacob our patriarch, too, chastised his sons, chastened them, and taught them his ways, until ultimately, there were none among them who was defective, as it is written: “These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt [with Jacob]” (Exodus 1:1); the verse likened them all to Jacob, as they were all righteous like he was. That is: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition.”
Another interpretation [of the phrase] “these [<i>ve’eleh</i>] are the names” – Rabbi Abbahu says: Anywhere that <i>eleh </i>is stated, it negates what preceded it; <i>ve’eleh</i>, it adds praise to what preceded it. “This is [<i>eleh</i>] the legacy of the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 2:4) negates “void and darkness” (Genesis 1:2). “These are [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the names” adds praise to the seventy people cited above; that they were all righteous.
These are the names [<i>shemot</i>] of the children of Israel who came to Egypt; Jacob and his sons, every man came with his household.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is a paraphrase of Exodus 1:1 and Genesis 46:8. </i> Israel is equated to the host of the heavens. <i>Shemot</i> is stated here and <i>shemot</i> is stated regarding the stars, as it is stated: “He sets a number for the stars and calls them all by name” (Psalms 147:4). The Holy One blessed be He, too, when they descended to Egypt, counted their numbers, how many they were. Because they are analogized to stars, He called them all by name; that is what is written: “These are the names of the children of Israel.”
“Who came to Egypt,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A more literal translation of the verse is “who were coming to Egypt.” </i> – was it today that they came? Hadn’t many years passed since they came to Egypt? Rather, as long as Joseph was alive, they did not have the burden of Egypt. Joseph died, and they placed the burden upon them. Therefore, “who came” is written, as though they entered Egypt on that day. <br> “With Jacob,” all these were under the patronage of Jacob, who amassed <i>mitzvot</i> and good deeds and was privileged to produce twelve tribes. <br>“Each came with his household.”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentaries suggest that the midrash should include here the following passage, which appears in Tanḥuma (Shemot 3): “Rabbi Huna said: This is to teach that he did not descend to Egypt until he arranged wives for Ḥetzron and Ḥamul, who were two years old and one year old respectively; “each came with his household.” See <i>Etz Yosef</i>. </i>
“These are the names of the children of Israel,” they are all mentioned here in the sense of the redemption of Israel. <br>Reuben, as it is stated: “I have seen the affliction of his people” (Exodus 3:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When Leah named her son Reuben, she said: “because the Lord has seen my affliction” (Genesis 29:32). The midrash is stating that his name also refers to the redemption of the children of Israel, as demonstrated by this verse (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>). This is true in a similar vain for all of the names listed below. </i> <br>Simeon, in the sense of: “God heard their groan” (Exodus 2:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Leah named Simeon saying: “because the Lord has heard that I am hated” (Genesis 29:33).</i> <br>Levi, in the sense that the Holy One blessed be He joined [them] in their troubles “from inside the bush” (Exodus 3:2),<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Leah named Levi saying: “now this time my husband will be joined to me” (Genesis 29:34). The fact that God spoke to Moses from inside a thorn bush indicated that He was with them in their pain. </i> to fulfill what is stated: “I am with him in times of trouble” (Psalms 91:15). <br>Judah, because they thanked the Holy One blessed be He.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">When Leah named Judah, she said “this time I will thank the Lord” (Genesis 29:35). </i> <br>Issachar, because the Holy One blessed be He paid their wages [<i>sakhar</i>] for their labor; the loot of Egypt and the loot at the sea, to fulfill what is written: “Afterward they will emerge with great wealth” (Genesis 15:14). <br>Zebulun, because the Holy One blessed be He rested His Divine Presence in their midst, as it is stated: “They shall make Me a sanctuary and I will dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8). Zebulun is nothing other than the Temple, as it is stated: “I have built You an abode [<i>beit zevul</i>], a place for Your dwelling forever” (I Kings 8:13). <br>Benjamin, in the sense of: “Your right hand, Lord, is glorious in power” (Exodus 15:6). <br>Dan, in the sense of: “And also that nation that they shall serve, I will judge [<i>dan</i>]” (Genesis 15:14). <br>Naftali after the Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> that the Holy One blessed be He had given them, regarding which it is written: “And sweeter than honey and the juices [<i>nofet</i>] of ripe fruit” (Psalms 19:11). <br>Gad, after the manna that the Holy One blessed be He fed them, which was “like the coriander [<i>gad</i>] seed” (Exodus 16:31). <br>Asher, because everyone who heard of their redemption and prominence would praise them, as it is written: “All the nations will praise you [<i>ve’ishru</i>], as you will be a desired land, said the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 3:12). <br>Joseph, because the Holy One blessed be He is destined to additionally [<i>lehosif</i>] redeem Israel from the evil empire,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Rome</i> just as He redeemed them from Egypt, as it is written: “It shall be on that day that the Lord will once again [<i>yosif</i>] set His hand a second time [to acquire the remnant of His people…as there was for Israel on the day of its ascent from the land of Egypt]” (Isaiah 11:11, 16), and the entire matter [written there].
This is what Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin says in the name of Rabbi Levi: Why are the names of the tribes not identical everywhere, but rather, at times this one precedes that one, and at times, that one precedes this one? It is so they would not say: The children of the wives are first and the children of the maidservants last, to teach you that these were not greater than those. Alternatively, why do these precede those? It is because they are the ceiling of the world. One who installs a ceiling properly places the thickness of this ceiling beam alongside one that is not its equal; therefore, this one precedes that one. From where is it derived that they are the ceiling [<i>tikra</i>] of the world? It is as Isaiah says: “Heed Me, Jacob and Israel, whom I called [<i>mekora’i</i>]” (Isaiah 48:12).
<b>“All the people who emerged from the loins of Jacob were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt” (Exodus 1:5).</b> <br>“All the people who emerged from the loins of Jacob,” including Joseph who was in Egypt, were seventy. <br>Alternatively, “and Joseph was in Egypt” [teaches that] even though Joseph ascended to royalty, he did not relate to his brothers and his father’s household with haughtiness. Just as he was insignificant in his [own] eyes initially when he was a slave in Egypt, so too, he was insignificant in his [own] eyes after he was king.
<b>“Joseph died along with all his brothers and that entire generation” (Exodus 1:6).</b> <br>Teaching that as long as one of those who descended to Egypt was alive, the Egyptians did not enslave Israel. <br> <b>“The children of Israel were fruitful, propagated, increased, and grew exceedingly, and the land filled with them” (Exodus 1:7).</b> <br>“The children of Israel were fruitful, propagated…” Even though Joseph and his brothers died, their God did not die, but rather: “The children of Israel were fruitful, propagated…”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It was His Providence that ensured the continuity of the children of Israel.</i> <br>Alternatively, each and every one gave birth to six in each womb, as it is stated: “The children of Israel were fruitful, propagated, [increased, and grew exceedingly, and the land filled with them.]” Some say: Twelve, as it is written: “Were fruitful” – two, “propagated” – two, “increased” – two, “grew” – two, “exceedingly [<i>bimod meod </i>]” – two, “and the land filled with them” – two, for a total of twelve.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">All the verbs are plural, the double language <i>bimod meod </i>indicates another two, and the land filled with them indicates another two. The first opinion derives one from each of those words and phrases.</i> <br> “Grew [<i>vayishretzu</i>],” some say: “Six<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">According to many commentaries, the correct wording here is “sixty.” </i> in each womb,” and do not wonder, as a scorpion, which is one of the swarming creatures [<i>sheratzim</i>], gives birth to sixty.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Some versions of the Hebrew text have “seventy,” but others have “sixty,” which is the version preferred by most commentaries. </i> Rabbi Natan says: “And the land was filled with them,” like fields of reeds. <br> <b>“A new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph” (Exodus 1:8).</b> <br>“A new king arose.” Once the Egyptians saw this, they issued new decrees against them; that is what is written: “A new king arose.” Rav and Shmuel, one says: [He was] actually new, and one says: He [was not new, but] issued new decrees, as he brought new decrees and calamities upon them. The reason of the one who says actually new, is that “new” is written. The reason of the one who says he issued new decrees, is that “he died” and “he reigned” is not written. “Who did not know Joseph” – according to the opinion of the one who says new, it works out well. But according to the one who says that he issued new decrees, how does he interpret it? It is because he was like one who did not know Joseph at all. <br>The Rabbis say: Why did it call him “a new king”? Was it not Pharaoh himself? Rather, the Egyptians said to Pharaoh: ‘Come let us confront this nation.’ He said to them: ‘You are fools. Until now we have been eating from what is theirs, how can we confront them? Were it not for Joseph we would not be alive.’ Because he did not heed them, they dethroned him for three months, until he said to them: ‘Anything that you want, I am with you.’ Then they restored him; therefore it is written: “A new king arose.” <br>The Rabbis introduced [this matter] with this verse: “They have betrayed the Lord, for they have begotten foreign children; now a month will devour them with their portions” (Hosea 5:7), teaching that when Joseph died, they abrogated the covenant of circumcision. They said: ‘Let us be like the Egyptians.’ From here you derive that Moses circumcised them upon their exodus from Egypt. Once they did this, the Holy One blessed be He transformed the love that the Egyptians felt for them into hatred, as it is stated: “He changed their hearts to hate His people, to harass His servants” (Psalms 105:25). This is the meaning of what is written: “Now a month [<i>ḥodesh</i>] will devour them with their portions” – the new [<i>ḥadash</i>] king, who issued new decrees against them. <br>“Who did not know Joseph.” Was he unfamiliar with Joseph? Rabbi Avin said: This is analogous to one who stoned one beloved by the king. The king said: ‘Behead him, because tomorrow he will do the same to me.’ That is why the verse wrote [this] about him, as though to say: Today [he acts as one], “who did not know Joseph,” tomorrow he is destined to say: “I do not know the Lord” (Exodus 5:2). <br>
<b>“He said to his people: Behold, the nation of the children of Israel is more numerous and mighty than us” (Exodus 1:9).</b> <br>“He said to his people” – he began with the counsel first; therefore, he was punished first. He began with the counsel first, as it is written: “He said to his people.” He was punished first, as it is written: “Upon you, upon your people, and upon all your servants, [the frogs will rise]” (Exodus 7:29). <br> <b>“Let us be shrewd with it, lest it increase, and it shall be that if a war will occur, it too will join our enemies and wage war against us and it will ascend from the land” (Exodus 1:10).</b> <br>“Let us be shrewd with it.” “With them” is not stated, but rather, “with it.” Rabbi Ḥama son of Rabbi Ḥanina said: He said: ‘Come let us be shrewd with the God of these. Shall we sentence them with the sword? It is already written: “And with His sword all flesh” (Isaiah 66:16). We will sentence them only with water, as the Holy One blessed be He took an oath that He will not bring a flood to the world, as it is stated: “As I took an oath that the waters of Noah would no longer pass over the earth” (Isaiah 54:9).’ But they did not know that He will not bring it over the entire world, but He will bring it on one nation. And He will not bring it [even] upon them, but they will come and fall into it, as it is stated: “They will be hurled [<i>yagiruhu</i>] to the sword [<i>ḥarev</i>]; they will be prey for the foxes [<i>shualim</i>]” (Psalms 63:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets this: He will entice [<i>yegareh</i>] them with dry land [<i>ḥorev</i>], into the waters of the sea [<i>sha’al yam</i>].</i> <br> “As it was in the matter that they conspired [against them]” (Exodus 18:11) – in the pot in which they cooked, they were cooked.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">They sought to drown the Jewish boys in the river; they were drowned in the Red Sea.</i> <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya said that Rabbi Simon said: There were three [involved] in that counsel: Bilam, Job, and Yitro. Bilam<b>, </b>who advised [Pharaoh to persecute Israel], was killed. Job, who was silent, was punished with suffering. Yitro, who fled, his descendants were privileged to sit in the Chamber of Hewn Stone, as it is stated: “The families of scribes who dwelled at Yabetz: The Tiratites, the Shime’atites, the Sukatites. These are the Kenites that came from Hamat, the father of the house of Rekhav” (I Chronicles<i> </i>2:55). And it is written: “The children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the city of the date palms with the children of Judah” (Judges 1:16). <br> <br>“…and it will ascend from the land” (Exodus<i> </i>1:10). It does not say: And we will ascend, but rather: “It will ascend.” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana says: It is like a person who curses himself but ascribes his curse to another.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Although Pharaoh’s stated concern was that the Israelites would leave Egypt, his real concern was that they would overcome the Egyptians and banish them from Egypt.</i> <br>Alternatively, “and it will ascend from the land,” any time that Israel reaches the ultimate depths, they ascend; see what is written: “And it will ascend from the land.” David said: “Our soul is bent to the dust; our belly cleaves to the earth.” (Psalms 44:26). At that moment: “Rise up, be our savior; redeem us for the sake of Your kindness” (Psalms 44:27).
<b>They imposed upon them taskmasters in order to afflict them with their burdens, and they built storage cities for Pharaoh, Pitom and Raamses (Exodus 1:11).</b> <br>“They imposed upon him [<i>alav</i>],”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Although the verse is generally translated “they imposed upon them taskmasters in order to afflict them with their burdens,” the object of the sentence is actually written in singular, such that a more literal translation is “they imposed upon it/him taskmasters to afflict it/him with their burdens.” </i> – “upon them [<i>aleihem</i>]” is not stated, but rather “upon him.” The school of Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon taught: It teaches that they brought a brick mold and they hung it on the neck of Pharaoh. If any individual from Israel would say: ‘I am a delicate person,’ they would say to him: ‘Are you more delicate than Pharaoh?’ “Taskmasters [<i>sarei missim</i>],” something upon which bricks are placed [<i>mesim</i>].“In order to afflict him with their burdens” – in order to afflict Pharaoh with the burdens of the Jewish people.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The brick mold was placed around Pharaoh’s neck in order to make it seem that he too was participating in the building efforts, so that the Israelites would willingly agree to begin working. </i> <br>“They built storage cities [<i>miskenot</i>] for Pharaoh.” Rav and Shmuel, one said: That endanger [<i>mesakenot</i>] their owners. And one said: That impoverish [<i>memaskenot</i>] their owners, as anyone who engages in construction become poor. The Rabbis say: Storehouses, as it says: “Go and approach that steward” (Isaiah 22:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to Shevna in whose hands the keys to the storehouses were entrusted. See Isaiah 22:22.</i> <br>“Pitom and Raamses,” Rav and Shmuel, one says: Pitom was its name, and why was it called Raamses? It is because [the buildings] would collapse [<i>mitrossess</i>] one by one. And one says: Raamses was its name, and why was it called Pitom? It is because the opening of the abyss [<i>pi tehom</i>] would swallow [the buildings] one by one.
<b>“But the more they would afflict it, the more it would increase and the more it would proliferate; they were disgusted by the children of Israel” (Exodus 1:12).</b> <br>“But the more they would afflict it, the more it would increase and the more it would proliferate.” “The more they increased and the more they proliferated is not stated, but rather, “it would increase and it would proliferate.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The Divine Spirit is heralding to them: Each of them “will increase and will proliferate.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">It is written in future tense and in the singular and not in past tense plural.</i> <br>“They were disgusted [<i>vayakutzu</i>] by the children of Israel,” teaching that Israel was like thorns [<i>kotzim</i>] in their eyes. <br><b>“The Egyptians enslaved the children of Israel ruthlessly [<i>befarekh</i>]” (Exodus 1:13).</b> <br>Rabbi Elazar said: With gentle persuasion [<i>befeh rakh</i>]. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says: With crushing cruelty [<i>bifrikha</i>]. This is what they did to each person of Israel: They imposed a decree upon them that each and every day they should produce the equivalent of the number of bricks that they produced on the first day. <br><b> “They embittered their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks, and with all kinds of work in the fields; all the work with which they worked them ruthlessly” (Exodus 1:14). </b> <br>“They embittered their lives with hard labor, etc.” – initially, “with mortar and with bricks,” and later “with all kinds of work in the field,” and ultimately, “all the work.” What is: “All the work with which they worked them ruthlessly”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said that Rabbi Yonatan [said]: It teaches that they would exchange the labor of men for women and the labor of women for men. Rabbi Avya said: Rabbi Elazar concedes that this is [work imposed] with crushing cruelty.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Although Rabbi Elazar interpreted the word <i>befarekh</i> in verse 13 to mean with gentle persuasion, he concedes that the word <i>befarekh</i> at the end of verse 14 means with crushing cruelty. Thus, the beginning of the servitude was conducted with gentle persuasion, but eventually it was with crushing cruelty. </i>
Pharaoh issued four decrees against them. Initially, he decreed and commanded the taskmasters to pressure them so that they would produce their quota and they would not sleep at home. He thought to diminish their procreation. He said: If they do not sleep at home they will not have children. The taskmasters said to them: ‘If you go to sleep in your homes, by the time we send to gather you in the morning, an hour or two of the day will have passed, and you will not meet your quota,’ as it is stated: “The taskmasters pressured them saying, [fulfill your work, your daily task]” (Exodus 5:13). <br>They would sleep on the ground. God said to them [the Egyptians]: ‘I said to their forefather Abraham that I will multiply his descendants like the stars, as it is stated: “For I will bless you, and I will multiply, etc.” (Genesis 22:17), and you are outsmarting them so they will not multiply? We will see whose matter prevails, Mine or yours.’ Immediately, “but the more they would afflict them, the more they would increase…” (Exodus 1:12). <br>Rabbi Akiva expounded: On account of the righteous women who were in that generation, Israel was redeemed from Egypt. What did they do? When they would go to draw water, the Holy One blessed be He would arrange for them small fish in their jugs, and they would draw half water and half fish. They would take it to their husbands and would place two pots on the fire [<i>veshoftot</i>], one with hot water and one with fish. They would feed them, bathe them, anoint them with oil, and give them to drink, and they would consort with them between the pots [<i>shefatayim</i>], as it is stated: “Now you may lie within the sheepfolds [<i>shefatayim</i>], wings of the dove covered with silver” (Psalms 68:14). In reward for having lain between the pots, Israel merited the loot of Egypt, as it is stated: “wings of the dove covered with silver.” <br>When they would conceive, they would come to their homes. When the time of their birth arrived, they would go and give birth in the fields, under apple trees, as it is stated: “Under the apple tree I roused you [there your mother was in childbirth]” (Song of Songs 8:5). The Holy One blessed be He would send an angel from the heavens above who would clean them and tend to them like the beast that tends to its young, as it is stated: “As for your birth, on the day you were born [your umbilical cord was not cut, and you were not washed in water for cleansing…and you were not swaddled]” (Ezekiel 16:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In this chapter, addressing the exile in Egypt, there was no midwife to perform these tasks; rather, God saw to them, as it is written: “I bathed you in water, rinsed your blood from upon you, and anointed you with oil. I dressed you in embroidered garments…I wrapped you, etc. (Ezekiel 16:9–10).</i> They would take two round vessels of earth, one containing oil and one containing honey, as it is stated: “He suckled them honey from a boulder [and oil from a flinty rock]” (Deuteronomy 32:13). <br>Once the Egyptians became aware of them [the babies], they sought to kill them. A miracle was performed for them and they were enveloped in the ground. They [the Egyptians] brought oxen and they plowed [the land] above them, as it is stated: “Upon my back plowers plowed” (Psalms 129:3). After [the Egyptians] would leave, they would sprout and emerge like the grass of the field, as it is stated: “I caused you to increase like the growth of the field” (Ezekiel 16:7). Once they grew, they would come in herds [<i>adarim</i>] to their homes, as it is stated: “You came to have great beauty [<i>ba’adi adayim</i>]” (ibid.) – do not read it <i>ba’adi adayim</i> but rather <i>be’edrei adarim</i>. When the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself on the sea, they recognized Him first, as it is stated: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2). <sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This is because they remembered Him from the miracles He performed for them in Egypt.</i>
<b>“The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shifra and the name of the other was Pu’a” (Exodus 1:15).</b> <br>When he saw that they were procreating, he issued a decree against the males <sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This is Pharaoh’s second decree.</i> – that is what is written: “The king of Egypt said to the midwives….” Who were the midwives? Rav said: A daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law, Yokheved and Elisheva daughter of Aminadav. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says: A woman and her daughter, Yokheved and Miriam. <br>And Miriam was no more than five years old, as Aaron was three years older than Moses. Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: She would go with her mother Yokheved and assist her, and she was very quick. While the child is still young, his [character] is recognizable. That is what Solomon said: “Even a lad is recognized through his deeds” (Proverbs 20:11). <br>“…the name of one was Shifra [and the name of the other was Pu’a],” because she would attend to [<i>meshaperet</i>] the baby when he would emerge covered in blood; “Pu’a,” because she would express [<i>nofa’at</i>] wine into the babies after her mother [had attended to them]. <br>Alternatively, Shifra, because Israel procreated [<i>sheparu veravu</i>] in her day; Pu’a, who would revive [<i>mapia</i>] the baby when they would say it was dead. <br>Alternatively, Shifra, because she made her actions pleasing [<i>shipera</i>] before God; Pu’a, because she caused Israel to appear [<i>hofia</i>] before God. Alternatively, Pu’a, because she was impudent [<i>hofia panim</i>] to Pharaoh and had her nose in the air toward him, and she said to him: ‘Woe unto that man when God will come and punish him.’ He became filled with fury and sought to kill her. Shifra, because she eased [<i>meshaperet</i>] the words of her daughter and placated him toward her. She said to him: ‘Are you paying attention to her? She is a child and knows nothing.’ <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Rav Yitzḥak said: Shifra, because she preserved Israel for God, and it was for their sake that the heavens were created, regarding which it is written: “By his wind the heavens are calm [<i>shifra</i>]” (Job 26:13). Pu’a, because she was impudent [<i>hofia panim</i>] toward her father. Amram was the head of the Sanhedrin at that time. Once Pharaoh issued his decree and said: “Every son that is born you shall cast him into the Nile” (Exodus 1:22), Amram said: ‘Isn’t Israel begetting children for naught?’ Immediately, he separated from Yokheved and abstained from sexual relations. <br>He divorced his wife when she was three months pregnant. All Israel arose and divorced their wives. His daughter said to him: ‘Your decree is harsher than Pharaoh’s, as Pharaoh decreed only against the males, and you, against the males and the females. Pharaoh is wicked and it is uncertain whether his decree will be fulfilled or whether it will not be fulfilled. However, you are righteous and your decree will be fulfilled.’ He arose and remarried his wife. All Israel arose and remarried their wives. That is Pu’a, who was impudent toward her father.
<b>He said: When you deliver the Hebrew women and you look upon the birthstool [<i>ovnayim</i>], if it is a son you shall kill him but if it is a daughter she shall live (Exodus 1:16).</b> <br>“He said: When you deliver the Hebrew women…” Why did he command to kill them by means of the midwives? It was so the Holy One blessed be He would not prosecute him, but would punish them. <br>“And you look upon the <i>ovnayim</i>,” [this is] the place through which the baby passes [as it emerges]. Alternatively, <i>ovnayim</i>, Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: The Holy One blessed be He makes a woman’s limbs hard as stones [<i>avanim</i>]<i> </i>when she is sitting on the birthstool in childbirth, as were it not so, she would die. Rabbi Pinḥas the <i>ḥaver</i> says in the name of Rabbi Yona, this supports Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: <i>Ovnayim</i> means nothing other than a block, which is a hard object, as it is written: “I went down to the potter’s house, and behold, he was at work on the wheel [<i>ovnayim</i>]” (Jeremiah 18:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This is the surface on which the potter produces his vessel..</i> Rabbi Ḥanin said: He provided them a clear sign: Just as the potter has one thigh here and one thigh there and the block in the middle, so too, a woman giving birth has one thigh here and one thigh there and the newborn is in the middle. Some say: When she crouches to deliver, her thighs grow cold as stones. <br>“If it is a son, you shall kill him.” He said to them, if it is male, kill him, and if it is female, do not kill her; rather, if she lives, she lives, and if she dies, she dies. They said to him: How will we know if it is male or if it is female? Rabbi Ḥanina said: He provided them a clear sign. If it is face down, know that he is male, as he is looking, in his mother, at the earth from which he was created. If it is face up, she is a female, as she is looking at her source, the rib, as it is stated: “He took one of his ribs” (Genesis 2:21). <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one, whoever gave this counsel is a fool. You should have killed the females. If there are no females from where will the males marry women? One woman cannot take two men, but one man can take ten women, or one hundred.’ That is: “The princes of Tzoan are but fools” (Isaiah 19:11); it is they who gave him this counsel.
<b>The midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them, and they kept the boys alive” (Exodus 1:17).</b> <br>“The midwives feared God.” About them it is stated: “A God-fearing woman, she will be praised” (Proverbs 31:30). <br>“And did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them [<i>aleihen</i>].” <i>Lahen </i>is not written, but rather <i>aleihen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">A formulation used elsewhere in the Bible in the sense of sexual relations, e.g., Genesis 29:23.</i> Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: It teaches that he demanded that they have relations with him, but they did not accept his proposition. <br>“They kept the boys alive.” Since they “did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them,” do we not know that they kept the boys alive? Why did the verse need to state: “They kept the boys alive”? There is praise within praise. Not only did they not fulfill his command, but they went beyond that and performed good deeds for their benefit. Some of them were poor women, and the midwives would go and collect water and food from the homes of wealthy women and would come and give it to the poor women, thereby sustaining their sons. That is what is written: “They kept the boys alive.” <br>Alternatively, “they kept the boys alive” – some had a condition that would result in their emerging crippled, blind, deformed, or needing to have a limb amputated in order to emerge safely. What would they do? They would stand in prayer and say before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You know that we did not fulfill Pharaoh’s command. It is Your words that we seek to fulfill. Lord of the universe, may this child emerge in peace, so Israel will not find a pretext to slander us, saying: Look, they emerged deformed because they sought to kill them.’ Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He would heed their voice, and [the babies] would emerge intact. <br>Rabbi Levi said: You stated the less severe scenarios; state the severe scenarios. Some of them had a condition that would cause them to die as they emerged, or endanger their mother so she would die after they emerged. They would stand in prayer and say to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, suspend their sentence now and give them life, so that Israel will not say: They killed them.’ The Holy One blessed be He would fulfill their prayer. Therefore, “they kept the boys alive [<i>vateḥayena et hayeladim</i>]” – <i>vateḥayena</i>, these are the mothers, <i>hayeladim</i>, these are the actual children. <br>Alternatively, “the midwives feared,” – they adorned themselves with the action of their ancestor, that is Abraham. Just as the Holy One blessed be He attests in his regard: “For now I know that you are God-fearing” (Genesis 22:12), they said: ‘Abraham our patriarch, of blessed memory, opened an inn and would feed all the passersby, uncircumcised people, and we, not only do we not have enough to feed them, but to kill them? We will keep them alive.’ When Pharaoh saw that they did not implement his decree, he sent and called for them; that is what is written: “The king of Egypt called for the midwives [and said to them: Why have you done this thing, and have kept the boys alive?”] (Exodus 1:18).
<b>The midwives said to Pharaoh: Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, as they are vigorous; before the midwife comes to them, they have delivered (Exodus 1:19).</b> <br>“As they are vigorous [<i>ḥayot</i>].” If you say that they are midwives,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">One of the interpretations of the Hebrew word <i>ḥaya </i>is midwife.</i> does one midwife not require another midwife to assist her? Rather, this is what they said to him: This nation is analogized to the beasts of the field, which do not require midwives. Judah is likened to a lion, as it is written: “Judah is a lion’s cub (Genesis 49:9); Dan, “Dan will be a serpent [on the road]” (Genesis 49:17); Naftali, “a hind let loose” (Genesis 49:21); Issachar is “a strong-boned donkey” (Genesis 49:14); Joseph, “a firstborn bull” (Deuteronomy 33:17); Benjamin is “a wolf that claws” (Genesis 49:27). Regarding the rest it is written: “How your mother was a lioness, she lay among lions” (Ezekiel 19:2). <br><b>God was good to the midwives; the people increased and they grew very mighty (Exodus 1:20).</b> <br>“God was good to the midwives.” What was this good? The king of Egypt accepted their explanations and did not harm them. <br>Alternatively, “God was good,” Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya ben Rabbi Abba: That is what is written: “He said to man: Behold, fear of the Lord, that is wisdom” (Job 28:28). What is the reward for fear? It is Torah. Because Yokheved feared the Holy One blessed be He, He produced Moses, of whom it is written: “That he was good” (Exodus 2:2), from her. And the Torah, that is called “a good acquisition” (Proverbs 4:2), was given through him, and it is called after his name, as it is stated: “Remember the Torah of Moses My servant” (Malachi 3:22). <br>As for Miriam, Betzalel, who was filled with wisdom, as it is written: “I filled him with the spirit of God, [with wisdom]” (Exodus 31:3), emerged from her. And he crafted an ark for the Torah, which is called “good” – that is: “God was good to the midwives.” <br>“The people increased,” to fulfill what is stated: “Who is it who says and it is realized, if the Lord did not command it?” (Lamentations 3:37). If Pharaoh commanded to kill all the males, to what avail was his decree when God did not command it? Rather: “The people increased and they grew very mighty.”
<b>“It was because the midwives feared God, He made houses for them” (Exodus 1:21).</b> <br> “It was because the midwives feared [God, He made houses for them].” Rav and Levi, one said: Priestly houses and Levite houses, and one said: Royal houses. Priestly and Levite houses from Moses and Aaron, royal houses from Miriam, because David emerged from Miriam, as it is written: “Caleb son of Ḥetzron begot Azuva, his wife, and Yeriot, and these are her sons: Yesher, Shovav, and Ardon” (I Chronicles 2:18). Azuva is Miriam. Why was she named Azuva? It is because everyone abandoned her.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Because she was sickly, none of the youths of Israel wanted to marry her.</i> “Begot,” but wasn’t she his wife? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who marries a woman for the sake of Heaven, the verse ascribes merit to him as though he begot her. “Yeriot,” because her face was like sheets [<i>yeriot</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Her face was beautiful like the sheets of the Tabernacle that were beautifully dyed.</i> “And these are her sons [<i>baneha</i>],” do not read it as <i>baneha</i>, but rather as <i>boneha</i>, the one who built her.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Her husband.</i> Yesher is Caleb, because he made himself upright [<i>yisher</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">He was not swayed by the counsel of the scouts.</i> [he is also called] Shovav, because he broke [<i>shibev</i>] himself,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">He overcame his evil inclination and resisted the counsel of the scouts.</i> [and he is called] Ardon, because he dominated [<i>rida</i>] his inclination. <br>“Azuva died” (I Chronicles 2:19), this teaches that she fell ill and they treated her as though she were dead,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This is referring to when Miriam was afflicted with leprosy; as when necessary for mourning the dead, the children of Israel sat in place for seven days.</i> and Caleb, too, abandoned her.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">When she was a leper, Caleb left her. When she recovered, he remarried her.</i> “Caleb took Efrat” (I Chronicles 2:19), this is Miriam. Why was she named Efrat? It is because Israel procreated [<i>faru</i>] thanks to her.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In Egypt, she convinced her father to remarry her mother and the rest of Israel followed suit.</i> What is: “Took”? It means that after she recovered, he performed an act of marriage and he seated her on a sedan chair because of his great joy over her. <br>Likewise, you find elsewhere that Miriam is called two names after events that befell her. That is what is written: “Ashḥur father of Tekoa had two wives: Ḥela and Naara.” (I Chronicles 4:5). Ashḥur is Caleb, because Ashḥur was the son of Ḥetzron. Why is he named Ashḥur? It is because his face was blackened [<i>hishḥir</i>] with fasts.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">He fasted so that he would not be influenced by the scouts.</i> “Father of,” because he became like a father to her; “Tekoa,” because he affixed [<i>taka</i>] his heart to his Father in Heaven; “had two wives,” as though they were two wives; “Ḥela and Naara,” they were not Ḥela and Naara, but rather she was Miriam. Why was she called Ḥela and Naara? It is because she was ill [<i>ḥalta</i>], and she shook off [<i>ninara</i>] her illness, and the Holy One blessed be He restored her to her youth [<i>lenaaruta</i>]. “Naara bore him” (I Chronicles 4:6) – after she was cured she bore him sons, “Aḥuzam and Ḥefer” (ibid.). “And the sons of Ḥela; Tzeret, Tzoḥar, and Etnan” (I Chronicles 4:7) – “Tzeret,” because she became a rival to her friends;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">They were envious of her beauty.</i> “Tzoḥar,” because her countenance was comparable to noon [<i>tzohorayim</i>]; “and Etnan,” because anyone who saw her would bring a gift [<i>etnan</i>] to his wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Upon seeing Miriam, one would be filled with desire and would seek to seduce one’s own wife to engage in relations.</i> That is why it is written: “Caleb took Efrat and she bore him Ḥur” (I Chronicles 2:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">As explained above, this verse refers to Caleb remarrying Miriam after her recovery. </i> From where is it derived that David descended from Miriam? It is as it is written: “David was the son of that nobleman [<i>Efrati</i>] from Bethlehem of Judah” (I Samuel 17:12). <br>Likewise you find that one verse says: “And the sons of Ḥela…” [and the next verse states:] “and Kotz begot Anuv, [Hatzoveva, and the families of Aḥarḥel son of Harum]” (I Chronicles 4:8). Kotz is Caleb, who undercut [<i>kitzetz</i>] the counsel of the scouts. “Begot Anuv,” he adopted good deeds at the time that they brought a cluster of grapes, as were it not for Caleb, they would not have brought it. “Hatzoveva,” he fulfilled the will [<i>tzivyono</i>] of the Holy One blessed be He; “and the families of Aḥarḥel,” Aḥarḥel is Miriam. Why was she named that? It is on the basis of: “All the women emerged after her [<i>aḥareha</i>] [with drums and dances]” (Exodus 15:20). What are “families?” He was privileged to establish families from her. “Son of Harum,” she was privileged to have David, whose kingdom the Holy One blessed be He elevated, descend from her, as you say: “He will give strength to His king, etc.” (I Samuel 2:10).
<b>“Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying: Every son that is born, you shall cast him into the Nile, and every daughter you shall keep alive” (Exodus 1:22).</b> <br>“Pharaoh commanded all his people,” Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina says: He issued the decree even against his own people. Why did he do so? It is because his astrologers said to him: ‘The redeemer of Israel has already been conceived by his mother, but we do not know whether he is Israelite or Egyptian.’ At that moment, Pharaoh gathered all the Egyptians and said to them: ‘Lend me your sons that will be born for [the next] nine months so I will cast them into the Nile.’<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The belief was that the Nile River was a deity and would repay those who worshipped it.</i> That is what is written: “Every son that is born, [you shall cast him] into the Nile.” “Every Israelite son” is not written but rather, “every son,” whether Israelite or Egyptian. But they [the Egyptians] did not want to accept it from him, as they said: ‘An Egyptian son will never redeem them, but rather, one from the Hebrew women.’ <br>“Cast him into the Nile.” Why did they decree to cast them into the Nile? It is because the astrologers foresaw that the redeemer of Israel would be condemned by means of water, and they believed that he would drown in water. But it was, in fact, only by means of a well that the decree of death was issued against him, as it is stated: “Because you did not have faith in me…[therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them; these are the waters of dispute…]” (Numbers 20:12–13). The Rabbis say that they [the astrologers] devised [this] counsel so that the Holy One blessed be He would not take vengeance against them by means of water. Because they knew that the punishments of the Holy One blessed be He fit the crime, and they were certain that He would not bring a flood to the world; therefore, they commanded to drown them in water. <br>“And every daughter you shall keep alive.” Why did Pharaoh need to keep the females alive? Rather, this is what they would say: ‘We will kill the males and take the females as wives,’ because the Egyptians were engulfed with lewdness.
“<b>A man from the house of Levi went and he took a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1).</b> <br>“A man from the house of Levi [went].” Where did he go? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Zevina said: He followed the counsel of his daughter. It is taught: Amram was the preeminent scholar of his generation, etc. <see above, <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:13>. “And he took a daughter of Levi.” And he remarried is not written, but rather, “he took.” Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Zevina said: He performed an act of marriage and he seated her on a litter and Miriam and Aaron were dancing before them and the ministering angels were saying: “The mother of the sons is joyous” (Psalms 113:9). <br>“A daughter of Levi.” Is it possible that she was one hundred and thirty years old and she is called a “daughter”? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina say: She was Yokheved, and she was conceived on the way and was born within the walls,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">She was born as Jacob and his descendants arrived in Egypt. </i> as it is stated: “Who was born to Levi in Egypt” (Numbers 26:59); her birth was in Egypt but not her conception. And [yet] she is called a “daughter”? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Zevina said: Signs of young womanhood developed in her.
<b>“The woman conceived and bore a son; she saw that he was good and she hid him for three months” (Exodus 2:2).</b> <br>“The woman conceived and bore a son” – Rabbi Yehuda said: Her birth is juxtaposed with her conception; just as her conception was painless, so too, her birth was painless. From here it is derived that righteous women were not included in the verdict of Eve. “She saw that he was good [<i>tov</i>].” It was taught that Rabbi Meir says: His name was Tov. Rabbi Yoshiya says: His name was Toviya. Rabbi Yehuda says: He was fit for prophecy. Others<i> </i>say: He was born circumcised. The Rabbis say: At the moment that Moses was born, the entire house was illuminated; here it is written: “She saw that he was good [<i>tov</i>].” There it is written: “God saw the light, that it was good [<i>tov</i>]” (Genesis 1:4). <br>“She hid him for three months” because the Egyptians counted only from the moment that he remarried her, but she had already been three months pregnant from the outset. <br><b>“She was no longer able to hide him, and she took for him a wicker basket and coated it with clay and with pitch; she placed the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the bank of the Nile” (Exodus 2:3).</b> <br>“She was no longer able to hide him” (Exodus 2:3). Why? It is because the Egyptians were going into each and every house in which they thought that a baby had been born, and would take a small Egyptian baby there and would cause him to cry, so that the Israelite baby would hear his voice and cry with him. That is what is written: “Catch us foxes, little foxes [that ruin vineyards…]” (Song of Songs 2:15). <sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The verse may also be translated: “The foxes held little foxes against us in order to ruin the vineyard,” and the midrash takes it in that sense. The Egyptians are compared to foxes because they are sly as foxes, and Israel is compared to a vineyard. </i>
“She took for him a wicker basket” – why wicker? Rabbi Elazar said: Because for the righteous, their property is dearer to them than their bodies. Why to that extent? It is because they do not extend their hands in robbery. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It is a pliable material that can withstand both soft and hard items. <br>“And coated it with clay and with pitch” – clay inside and pitch outside, so that this righteous one would not smell a foul odor. <br>“She placed the child in it [and placed it among the reeds on the bank of the Nile].” Rabbi Elazar said: The Sea of Reeds, as the Sea of Reeds reaches as far as the Nile. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: A marsh, as it is stated: “Cane and reeds will wither” (Isaiah 19:6). <sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the reeds mentioned in the verse are not a reference to the Sea of Reeds, but to actual reeds that grow in the shallow waters of a lake or river. </i> Why did she cast him into the Nile? So that the astrologers would think that he had already been cast into the water and they would no longer search for him.
<b>“His sister positioned herself at a distance to know what would happen to him” (Exodus 2:4).</b> <br>“His sister positioned herself at a distance.” Why did Miriam stand at a distance? Rabbi Amram said in the name of Rav: It is because Miriam had been prophesying and saying: ‘My mother is destined to bear a son who will redeem Israel.’ When Moses was born the house was filled with light. Her father stood and kissed her on her head. He said to her: ‘My daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled.’ That is what is written: “Miriam the prophetess, sister of Aaron, took the drum” (Exodus 15:20). [Was she] the sister of Aaron but not the sister of Moses? Rather, she said this prophecy when she was the sister of Aaron, and Moses had not yet been born. When they cast him into the Nile, her mother stood and struck her on her head. She said to her: ‘Where is your prophecy?’ That is what is written: “His sister positioned herself at a distance [to know]” – to know what would be the fate of her prophecy. <br>The Rabbis say: The entire verse is stated as an allusion to the Divine Spirit: “Positioned herself [<i>vatetatzav</i>],” alluding to: “The Lord came and stood [<i>vayityatzev</i>]” (I Samuel 3:10); “his sister,” alluding to: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister” (Proverbs 7:4); “at a distance,” alluding to: “From a distance the Lord appeared to me” (Jeremiah 31:2); “to know [<i>lede’a</i>] what would happen to him,” alluding to: “As the Lord is a God of knowledge [<i>de’ot</i>]” (I Samuel 2:3).
<b>“The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe in the Nile while her maidens were walking on the bank of the Nile. She saw the basket among the reeds and she sent her maidservant [<i>amatah</i>] and she took it” (Exodus 2:5).</b> <br>“To bathe in the Nile” (Exodus 2:5) – to wash off the idolatry of her father’s home. “While her maidens were walking [<i>holekhot</i>],” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The term <i>halikha</i> here is nothing other than an expression of death, and likewise it says: “Behold, I am going [<i>holekh</i>] to die” (Genesis 25:32). They said to her: ‘Our mistress, the way of the world is that a king issues a decree and the entire world does not fulfill it, but his children and the members of his household fulfill it; and you are violating the command of your father.’ Immediately, [the angel] Gabriel came and slammed them onto the ground [and killed them]. <br>“She sent her maidservant [<i>amatah</i>] and she took it.” Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, one says her arm, and one says her maidservant. The reason for the one who says “her arm” is that <i>amatah</i> is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Had the verse been referring to her maidservant, it should have said <i>na’aratah</i>, maiden, which is the expression employed earlier in the verse.</i> The reason for the one who says “her maidservant” is that <i>yadah<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The more common term for “her arm.” </i></i> is not written. According to the opinion of the one who says her maidservant, when Gabriel came and slammed them onto the ground, he spared one of them, as it is not the way of a princess to remain alone. <br>They raise an objection: According to the one who says “her hand,” let it write “<i>yadah</i>.” This is not difficult, as this is the reason that <i>amatah </i>is written, because her arm was stretched.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Her arm stretched, so it was the length of several cubits (<i>amot</i>).</i> We learned: Likewise you find: “You have broken [<i>shibarta</i>] the teeth of the wicked” (Psalms 3:8); do not read it as <i>shibarta</i>, but rather as <i>shirbavta</i>, that you enlarged and extended. <br>The Rabbis say: Pharaoh’s daughter was a leper; that is why she went to bathe. When she touched the basket she was cured. That is why she had compassion for Moses and loved him exceedingly.
<b>“She opened it and saw the child [<i>yeled</i>], and behold, a boy [<i>na’ar</i>] crying.

It is taught: He was a child but his voice was like that of a lad, this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: If so, you have rendered Moses, of blessed memory, blemished.

Alternatively, “behold, a boy [<i>na’ar</i>] crying,” – he was a child but he conducted himself like a lad [<i>na’ar</i>]. Gabriel came and struck Moses so that he would cry and she would be filled with compassion for him. “She had compassion for him.” When she saw him crying, she had compassion for him. “She said: This is from the children of the Hebrews.” How did she ascertain this about him? Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: She saw that he was circumcised. <br>“This [is from the children of the Hebrews],” – what is “this”? This one has fallen into the Nile, but no other will fall into the Nile, as once they cast Moses into the Nile, the decree was abrogated, like that which Rabbi Elazar said: What is it that is written? “And if they will say to you: Consult the mediums and the necromancers who chirp [<i>hametzaftzefim</i>] and mutter [<i>hamagim</i>]” (Isaiah 8:19). They prognosticate [<i>tzofim</i>] but they do not know what they prognosticate, and they pontificate [<i>hogim</i>] but they do not know what they pontificate. They saw that the redeemer of Israel will be condemned by means of water. They rose and decreed: “Every son who is born [you shall cast him into the Nile]” (Exodus 1:22). Once Moses was cast into the water, they said: ‘Their redeemer has already been cast in the water.’ Immediately, they abrogated the decree. But they did not know that he would be stricken over the waters of dispute, like that which Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: What is it that is written: “These<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This is an indication that these waters were familiar from some previous occurrence.</i> are the waters of dispute” (Numbers 20:13). Pharaoh’s astrologers saw these [waters] and were mistaken.

The midrash claims that Moses is saying that because he was placed in the river, the decree to throw the boys in the river was abrogated.</i> all of you were saved. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: That day was the twenty-first of Nisan. The ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, shall he who is destined to recite a song at the sea on this date be stricken by water on this day?’ Rav Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: That day was the sixth of Sivan. The ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Shall he who is destined to receive the Torah on Mount Sinai on this day be stricken on this day?’ They raised an objection: On the seventh of Adar Moses was born. According to the opinion of the one who says on the sixth of Sivan he was cast into the Nile, it works out well, as from the seventh of Adar until the sixth of Sivan are the three months that he was hidden. However, according to the one who says it was on the twenty-first of Nisan, it does not work out well. But it is not a difficulty, as that year was a leap year; most of the first month, most of the last month, and the entire middle month are considered three months.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was born on the seventh day of the first Adar.

<b>“His sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter: Shall I go and call you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” (Exodus 2:7). </b> <br>“His sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, etc.” Why did Miriam say: “From the Hebrew women”? Was it prohibited for Moses to nurse from the milk of a gentile woman? That is not what we learned: A Jewish woman may not nurse the son of a gentile woman, but a gentile woman may nurse the son of a Jewish woman on [the Jewish woman’s] property (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 26a). Why did she say so? It is because [Pharaoh’s daughter] had passed Moses around to all the Egyptian women to nurse him, but he rejected them all. Why did he reject them? The Holy One blessed be He said: Shall the mouth that is destined to speak with Me imbibe an impure substance? That is what is written: “To whom will one teach knowledge, [and who can understand a lesson? Those weaned from milk, detached from breasts”] (Isaiah 28:9). To whom will [God] teach knowledge? To those weaned from milk, etc. Alternatively, why did he reject their breasts? The Holy One blessed be He said: This one is destined to speak with Me. Tomorrow the Egyptian women will say: ‘This one who is speaking with the Divine Spirit, I nursed him.’ <br><b>“Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Go. The girl went and called the mother of the child” (Exodus 2:8). </b> <br>“The girl [<i>alma</i>] went.” Why did the verse call her <i>alma</i>? It is because she went with alacrity.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Alma </i>typically refers to a young adult woman.</i> Rabbi Shmuel said: It is because she was guarded in her words.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">She did not tell Pharaoh’s daughter that she was the child’s sister and that she was calling child’s mother. </i> <br><b>“Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages. The woman took the child and she nursed him” (Exodus 2:9).</b> <br>“Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Take [<i>heilikhi</i>].” Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: She prophesied, but she did not know what she prophesied: <i>Heilikhi</i>, he is yours.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>heilikhi</i> is interpreted as though it was two words: <i>Hei likhi</i>, this is yours. </i> <br>“And I will give you your wages.” Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: It is not enough for the righteous that their lost items are returned to them; they also receive a reward. <br>“The woman took the child and she nursed him.” At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He gave her a partial reward. She had sustained the children, and likewise, the Holy One blessed be He returned her son to her and gave her wages.
<b>“The child grew and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he was a son to her. She named him Moses and she said: Because I drew him from the water” (Exodus 2:10).</b> <br>“The child grew.” She nursed him for twenty-four months and you say “the child grew”? Rather, it was that he was growing in a manner that was atypical in the land. <br>“She brought her to Pharaoh’s daughter…” Pharaoh’s daughter was kissing, hugging, and loving him as though he were her son, and would not take him out of the king’s palace. Because he was beautiful, everyone desired to see him, and anyone who saw him would not leave him. Pharaoh would kiss him and hug him, and he would take Pharaoh’s crown and place it on his head, as he was destined to do when he grew older. <br>Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He said to Ḥiram: “I have drawn fire from your midst….” (Ezekiel 28:18),<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, the fire that will destroy him will originate in his household.</i> and likewise Pharaoh’s daughter was raising the one who was destined to exact retribution from her father. The messianic king, too, who is destined to exact retribution from Edom, resides with them in the same country, as it is stated: “There the calf will graze and there it will lie [and consume its branches]” (Isaiah 27:10). <br>The magicians of Egypt were sitting there, and said: ‘we are afraid of this one who takes your crown and places it on his head, lest he be the one regarding whom we said that he is destined to wrest your kingdom from you.’ Some of them said to behead him, some said to burn him. Yitro was sitting in their midst and saying to them: ‘This boy has no intelligence. Rather, test him. Bring before him a bowl with gold and a hot coal. If he extends his hand to the gold, he has intelligence and [you should] execute him; and if he extends his hand to the coal, he has no intelligence and he has no sentence of death.’ Immediately, they brought it before him and he extended his hand to take the gold. Gabriel came and pushed his hand. He seized the coal and placed his hand with the coal into his mouth, and his tongue was burned. From that he became “slow of speech and slow of tongue” (Exodus 4:10). <br>“She named him Moses” – from here you learn the reward of those who perform of acts of kindness. Although Moses had many names, the name that was set for him throughout the Torah was only the one that Batya daughter of Pharaoh called him. Even the Holy One blessed be He did not call him by any other name.
<b>“It was in those days, Moses grew and went out to his brethren, and he saw their burdens; he saw an Egyptian man beating a Hebrew man of his brethren” (Exodus 2:11).</b> <br>“It was in those days, Moses grew,” – Moses was twenty years old at that time, and some say forty years old. “Moses grew.” Doesn’t everyone grow? Rather, it is telling you that he grew in an atypical manner. “And went out to his brethren,” this righteous one went out twice<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Moses left the palace twice to check on his brethren.</i> and the Holy One blessed be He wrote them one after another; “he went out on the second day” (Exodus 2:13), these are two. <br>“He saw their burdens.” What is “he saw”? He would see their burdens and cry and say: ‘Woe is me over you; would that I could die for you. There is no labor more arduous than labor with mortar.’ He would shoulder [the burdens] and help each and every one of them. Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: He saw a large burden on a small man and a small burden on a large man; the burden of a man on a woman and the burden of a woman on a man; the burden of an elderly man on a lad and the burden of a lad on an elderly man. He would leave his royal guard and would arrange their burdens, feigning as though he was helping Pharaoh. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You left your affairs and went to observe the Israelite’s suffering, and you treated them in a brotherly manner; I will leave the upper and lower worlds to speak with you.’ That is what is written: “The Lord saw that he had turned to see” (Exodus 3:4); the Holy One blessed be He saw that he turned from his affairs to see their burdens; therefore, “God called to him from the midst of the bush” (ibid.).
Alternatively, “he saw their burdens,” – he saw that they had no respite. He went and said to Pharaoh: ‘One who has a slave, if he does not rest one day a week, he will die. These are your slaves. If you do not allow them to rest one day a week they will die.’ He said to him: ‘Go and do with them whatever you say.’ Moses went and instituted the day of Shabbat for rest. <br>“He saw an Egyptian man.” What did he see? Rav Huna said in the name of bar Kapara: Because of four matters, Israel was redeemed from Egypt: One, because they did not change their names.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The continuation of this list is found in <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 32:5: They did not change their names or language, they did not speak slander, and none of them informed the Egyptians that they were not intending to return the vessels they borrowed before leaving Egypt. </i> <br>From where is it derived that they were not suspected of licentiousness? The fact is that there was one woman<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Only one woman engaged in licentiousness. </i> and the verse publicized her, as it is stated: “[The son of an Israelite woman and he was the son of an Egyptian man]…and the name of his mother was Shelomit bat Divri….” (Leviticus 24: 10–11). <br>Our Sages, of blessed memory, say: The taskmasters were Egyptian and the foremen were Israelite; one taskmaster was appointed over ten foremen, and one foreman was appointed over ten Israelites. The taskmasters would go to the homes of the foremen early in the morning to get them out to work with the crowing of the rooster. Once, an Egyptian taskmaster went to an Israelite foreman and directed his glance to his wife, who was beautiful and flawless. He arrived there at the time of the crowing of the rooster and got him out of the house. The Egyptian returned and consorted with his wife, as she thought it was her husband, and she was impregnated. Her husband returned and saw the Egyptian emerging from his home. He asked her: ‘Did he touch you?’ She said: ‘Yes, and I thought he was you.’ <br>Once the taskmaster realized that [the Israelite] had sensed what he had done, he returned him to hard labor, and was beating him, seeking to kill him. Moses was looking at him and watching him, and he saw by means of the Divine Spirit what he had done at his home and saw what he was going to do to him in the field. He said: ‘This one is certainly liable for execution, as it is written: “One who strikes a person shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21). Moreover, he consorted with Datan’s wife and for that he is liable for execution, as it is stated: “The adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death”’ (Leviticus 20:10). That is what is written: “He turned this way and that [and saw that there was no man; he smote the Egyptian and concealed him in the sand]” (Exodus 2:12) – he saw what he had done to him in the house and what he had done to him in the field.
<b>“He turned this way and that and saw that there was no man; he smote the Egyptian and concealed him in the sand” (Exodus 2:12). </b> <br>“He saw that there was no man,” because he was deserving of death. Rabbi Yehuda says: There was no man who would be zealous on behalf of the Holy One blessed be He, and kill him. Rabbi Neḥemya says: He saw that there was no one who would invoke the name of God and kill him. The Rabbis say: He saw that there was no expectation that righteous people would emerge from him or from his descendants until the end of all the generations. When Moses saw this, he consulted with the angels and said to them: ‘Is this one liable for execution?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ That is what is written: “He saw that there was no man” – who would speak in his favor. <br>“He smote the Egyptian.” With what did he kill him? Rabbi Evyatar said: He struck him with a fist. Some say: He took a mortar rake and removed his brain. The Rabbis say: He invoked the name of God and killed him, as it is stated; “Do you propose [<i>omer</i>] to kill me [as you killed the Egyptian?]” (Exodus 2:14). <br>“He concealed him in the sand” as there was no one there other than Israelites. He concealed him before Israel, who were likened to sand. He said to them: ‘You were likened to sand; just as sand, a person takes it from here and places it there and no sound is heard, so too, this matter will remain concealed among you and will not be heard.’ Indeed, you find that the matter was heard only by means of the Hebrews, as it is stated: “He went out on the second day and behold, two Hebrew men were fighting [<i>nitzim</i>]; [he said to the wicked one: why do you strike your counterpart?]” (Exodus 2:13). These are Datan and Aviram, and it called them <i>nitzim </i>after their end.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">“They are Datan and Aviram…who agitated [<i>hitzu</i>] against Moses…when they agitated [<i>behatzotam</i>] against the Lord” (Numbers 26:9).</i> It was they who said this matter, it was they who left over some of the manna. It was they who said: “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt” (Numbers 14:4). And it was they who agitated at the Red Sea. <br>Alternatively, [they are called] <i>nitzim</i> because they intended to kill one another, as it is said: “If men fight together” (Deuteronomy 25:11), and Rabbi Elazar said: The verse is referring to a fight to the death. <br>“He said to the wicked one: Why do you strike your counterpart?” Why did you strike is not stated, but rather “why do you strike.” From here it is derived that from the moment that a person raises his hand against another, even if he does not strike him, he is called wicked. “Your counterpart,” who is wicked like you are; this teaches both of them were wicked.
<b>“He said: Who appointed you a ruler and judge over us? Do you propose to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? Moses was frightened and said: Indeed, the matter is known” (Exodus 2:14).</b> <br>“Who appointed you a ruler [and judge [<i>ish sar veshofet</i>] over us?]” – Rabbi Yehuda says: Moses was twenty years old at that time. They said to him: ‘You are not yet eligible to be a ruler and a judge over us, because [only] one who is forty years old has understanding’ (<i>Avot </i>5:25). Rabbi Neḥemya says that he was forty years old. They said to him: ‘Certainly you are a man [<i>ish</i>], but you are not eligible to be a ruler and a judge [<i>sar veshofet</i>] over us.’ The Rabbis say that they said to him: ‘Aren’t you the son of Yokheved? How do they call you son of Batya? You seek to be a ruler and a judge over us? We will inform about you, what you did to the Egyptian.’ <br>“Do you propose [<i>omer</i>] to kill me?” Do you seek to kill me is not stated, but rather do you <i>omer</i> [literally, say]. From here you learn that he had invoked the ineffable name against the Egyptian, and killed him. When he heard this,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">When Moses heard the response of the Hebrew man he had rebuked. </i> he feared slander and he said: “Indeed, the matter is known.” Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Shalom [said] in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina the Great, and our Rabbis said in the name of Rabbi Alexandri: Moshe was pondering in his heart and saying: What sin did Israel commit that caused them, more than all the nations, to be enslaved? When he heard his response, he said: ‘There is slander in their midst, how can they be deserving of redemption?’ Therefore he said: “Indeed the matter is known” – now I know the reason for their enslavement.
<b>“Pharaoh heard this matter and he sought to kill Moses. Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and he settled in the land of Midyan, and sat alongside the well” (Exodus 2:15).</b> <br>“Pharaoh heard” – because Datan and Aviram arose and informed on him. “He sought to kill Moses.” Pharaoh sent and they brought an incomparable sword and he struck his neck ten times, but Moses’s neck became like an ivory tower and it did not harm him, as it is stated: “Your neck is like an ivory tower” (Song of Songs 7:5). <br>“Moses fled from before Pharaoh.” Rabbi Yannai says: Is it possible for flesh and blood to flee from the monarchy? Rather, at the moment that they apprehended Moses and sentenced him to beheading, an angel descended from the heavens and appeared to them in the image of Moses. They seized the angel and Moses fled. <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: All the legal advisers who were sitting before Pharaoh became [impaired]; some mute, some deaf, and some blind. He [Pharaoh] was saying to the mutes: ‘Where is Moses?’ but they did not talk; to the deaf, but they did not hear; to the blind, but they did not see. That is what the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Who gives a mouth to man?” (Exodus 4:11). Who gave a mouth to Pharaoh, who said with his mouth: ‘Bring Moses to the platform to execute him’? “Or who makes one mute,” (ibid.) – who rendered the deputies mute, deaf, and blind so they did not bring you? And who made you clever so you would flee? “Is it not I, the Lord?” (ibid.). I was with you there, and I stand with you today.
“He settled in the land of Midyan, and sat alongside the well.” He learned the way of the patriarchs. Three were paired with their mates at the well; Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. Regarding Isaac, it is written: “Isaac came from going to Be’er [laḥai ro’i]” (Genesis 24:62).<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">This is the well where God had once appeared to Hagar. This is the context in which Isaac met Rebecca, who was returning with Abraham’s servant, identified by the midrash as Eliezer. Isaac then married her; see Genesis 24:63-67. </i> Moreover, Rebecca met Eliezer near the spring. Jacob, “he saw, and behold, there was a well in the field” (Genesis 29:2); <sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">It was there that Jacob first met Rachel; see Genesis 29:10-11. </i> Moses, “and he sat alongside the well.” <br><b>“The priest of Midian had seven daughters; they came and they drew water and filled the troughs to give their father’s flock to drink” (Exodus 2:16).</b> <br>“The priest of Midian had seven daughters.” But doesn’t the Holy One blessed be He hate idol worship, and yet He provided Moses haven with an idol worshipper? Rather, our Rabbis said: Yitro was a priest for idol worship and he saw that it lacked substance, and he scorned it, and he thought about repenting before Moses arrived. He called the residents of his city and said: ‘Until now, I have served you. Now I am old; choose another priest.’ He arose and removed the service vessels of idol worship and gave them all to them. They arose and ostracized him so that no one should have ties with him, no one should perform labor for him, and no one should herd his flocks. He asked the shepherds to herd his flocks for him, but they did not agree; therefore, he sent his daughters out. <br>“They came and they drew.” It teaches that they would arrive early due to fear of the shepherds. <br><b>“The shepherds came and drove them away; Moses rose and rescued them and gave their flocks to drink” (Genesis 2:17).</b> <br>“The shepherds came and drove them away.” Is it possible that he was the priest of Midyan and the shepherds were driving away his daughters? Rather, it teaches you that they ostracized him and drove away his daughters like a divorced woman, like you say: “He drove out the man” (Genesis 3:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse, God permanently banished man from the Garden of Eden. So too, the shepherds sought to permanently banish Yitro’s daughters. </i> <br>“Moses rose and rescued them.” This teaches that he sat in judgment regarding them.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from the fact that the verse says that he rose, indicating that beforehand he was sitting.</i> He said: Typically, men draw the water and women give the flocks to drink, while here, women draw and men give the flocks to drink. It does not say “he saved them [<i>vayatzilan</i>],” but rather, “he rescued them [<i>vayoshian</i>].” Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: They came to engage with them in a matter of forbidden sexual relations; here it is stated: “Moses rose and rescued them ,” and there it is stated: “The betrothed young woman screamed, and there was no one to rescue her” (Deuteronomy 22:27). Just as there, it is referring to forbidden sexual relations, here too it is referring to forbidden sexual relations. <br>The Rabbis say: This teaches that they cast them into the water and Moses saved them. <i>Vayoshian </i>is nothing other than an expression of saving from water, as it is stated: “Rescue me God, as the water has reached my soul” (Psalms 69:2). “And gave their flocks to drink.” This teaches that Moses drew water for them and gave their flocks to drink, just as Jacob did for Rachel. <br><b>“They came to their father Reuel. He said: Why were you quick to come today?” (Exodus 2:18).</b> <br>“They came to their father Reuel.” This is Yitro. Why is he named Reuel? It is because he became a companion to God. “He said: Why were you quick to come today?” From here you learn that on all days they would come last. <br><b>“They said: An Egyptian man saved us from the shepherds and also drew water for us and gave the flock to drink” (Exodus 2:19).</b> <br>“They said: An Egyptian man saved us from the shepherds.” Was Moses an Egyptian? Rather, his garb was Egyptian, but he was a Hebrew. Alternatively, “an Egyptian man,” this is analogous to one who was bitten by a deadly snake and was running to put his legs in water. He placed them in the river and saw a certain child sinking in the water, and he extended his hand and saved him. The child said to him: ‘Were it not for you, I would have died.’ He said to him: ‘It is not I who saved you, but rather, the deadly snake that bit me and I fled from it; it saved you.’ Similarly, Yitro’s daughters said to Moses: ‘Well done that you saved us from the shepherds.’ Moses said to them: ‘That Egyptian whom I killed, he saved you.’ That is why they said to their father, “an Egyptian man saved us,” in other words: Who caused this one to come to us? It is the Egyptian man whom he killed. <br>“Drew water [<i>dalo dala</i>],” he drew one drawing of water and gave water to all the flocks to drink, and the water was blessed for his sake. That is what is written: “and gave the flock to drink.” Our flock is not written, but rather “the flock,” as he gave even the flocks of the shepherds to drink. What then is “for us”? It means that he drew us out, too, as the shepherds cast us into the water and he took us out. <br><b>“He said to his daughters: Where is he? Why did you leave the man? Call him so that he will eat bread” (Exodus 2:20).</b> <br>“He said to his daughters: Where is he?” He said to them: ‘The fact that you say that he drew water and gave water to all the flocks is an indicator that he is one of the descendants of Jacob who stood at the well and the water was blessed for his sake.’ <br>“Why did you leave the man? [Call him so that he will eat bread],” – perhaps he will marry one of you. The eating of bread mentioned here refers to nothing other than a wife, similar to: “Except for the bread that he eats” (Genesis 39:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph stated this in reference to Potifar’s wife.</i> Immediately, Tzipora ran after him like a bird [<i>tzipor</i>] and brought him.

<b>“Moses decided to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Tzipora to Moses” (Exodus 2:21).</b> <br>“Moses decided [<i>vayoel</i>]” – Rabbi Yehuda says that he took an oath to him, as <i>vayoel </i>is nothing other than an expression of an oath, as it is stated: “Saul administered an oath [<i>vayoel</i>] to the people” (I Samuel 14:24). Why did he administer an oath to him? He said to him: ‘I know that Jacob your ancestor, when Lavan gave him his daughters, he took them and left without [Lavan’s] knowledge. Perhaps, if I give you my daughter you will do the same to me.’ Immediately, [Moses] took an oath to him, and [Yitro] gave him Tzipora. <br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: He accepted upon himself to stay the night with him, as <i>vayoel </i>is nothing other than an expression of staying the night, as it is stated: “Please agree [<i>hoel</i>] and stay the night” (Judges 19:6). Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said that he accepted upon himself to herd his flocks, as <i>vayoel </i>is nothing other than an expression of beginning. When he married his daughter, he began and accepted upon himself to herd his flocks. <br><b>“She bore a son and he named him Gershom because he said: I was a stranger [<i>ger</i>] in a foreign land” (Exodus 2:22).</b> <br>“She bore a son and he named him Gershom.” It is the way of the righteous to name their sons after an event. In Joseph’s regard what does it say? “He named the firstborn Manasseh…and the second he named Ephraim”<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Manasseh, “because God has made me forget [<i>nashani</i>] all my toil and all my father’s household.” Ephraim, “because God has made me fruitful [<i>hifrani</i>] in the land of my affliction.”</i> (Genesis 41:51–52), in order to recall the miracles that the Holy One blessed be He performed on his behalf. Moses, too, named his son Gershom after the miracle that the Lord performed on his behalf; that he was a stranger in a foreign land, and the Holy One blessed be He brought him success there.
<b>“It was during those many days that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed due to the work, and they cried out.

Similarly, “and a woman, if her flow of blood shall flow many days” (Leviticus 15:25); because they are days of suffering, it calls them many. <br>“The king of Egypt died.” He was afflicted with leprosy, and a leper is considered as dead, as it is stated: “Let her not be like a corpse” (Numbers 12:12),<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Aaron said this when Miriam was afflicted with leprosy.</i> and it says: “It was during the year of the death of King Uzziahu” (Isaiah 6:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">King Uziahu was afflicted with leprosy.</i> <br>“The children of Israel sighed [due to the work, and they cried out [<i>vayizaku</i>]].” Why did they sigh? It is because the magicians of Egypt said [to Pharaoh]: ‘Your only cure is to slaughter from among the Israelite young, one hundred and fifty in the evening and one hundred and fifty in the morning, and bathe in their blood twice a day.’ When Israel heard the harsh decree, they began groaning and lamenting. <i>Vayizaku</i> is nothing other than a term denoting lamentation, as it is written: “Cry out [<i>ze’ak</i>] and lament, son of man” (Ezekiel 21:17). <br>“Their plea [<i>shavatam</i>] rose to God.” It does not say “their outcry [<i>tza’akatam</i>],” but rather, their plea [<i>shavatam</i>], as it is stated: “And the souls of the dead plead [<i>teshave’a</i>]” (Job 24:12). <br><b>“God heard their moaning and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob” (Exodus 2:24).</b> <br>“God heard their moaning [<i>na’akatam</i>],” the moaning of the slain, as it is said: “He will moan [<i>vena’ak</i>] the moans of the slain” (Ezekiel 30:24), and as it is said: “They moan [<i>yinaku</i>] from a populated [<i>metim</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>metim</i> is expounded as though it were vocalized with a <i>tzerei</i>, meaning “the dead,” instead of a <i>sheva</i>, which is how it is vocalized in the verse. When vocalized with a <i>sheva</i>, it means “populated.” </i> city” (Job 24:12). <br>“God remembered His covenant.” Israel was not worthy of being saved, because they were wicked, but they were redeemed because of the merit of the patriarchs. That is what is written: “God remembered His covenant.” Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, say: A miracle was performed on their behalf and [Pharaoh] was cured from his leprosy.
<b>“God saw the children of Israel, and God knew” (Exodus 2:25).</b> <br>“God saw the children of Israel,” as it is stated: “I have seen the affliction of My people” (Exodus 3:7). “And God knew” (Exodus 2:25); “as I know its pains” (Exodus 3:7). <br>Alternatively, “God saw” that they did not have good deeds for which their redemption would be warranted. Likewise, it is explicated by Ezekiel: “I rendered you as numerous as the plants of the field [and you increased and grew, and you came to great beauty: Breasts developed and your hair grew, but you were naked and bare]” (Ezekiel 16:7). It should have said “and your hair grew” and only then “breasts developed,” as the lower sign of puberty precedes the upper one. Rather, what is “breasts developed [<i>nakhonu</i>]”? These are Moses and Aaron, who were prepared [<i>nekhonim</i>] to redeem them, as it is written: “Your two breasts<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is expounded as referring to Moses and Aaron.</i> are like two fawns” (Song of Songs 4:5). “And your hair grew,” the time of the redemption has arrived.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Pubic hair serves as the sign of the culmination of childhood and the beginning of adulthood.</i> “But you were naked and bare,” bereft of good deeds; therefore, it states: “God saw” that they did not have any good deeds for which their redemption would be warranted.
“God saw the children of Israel, and God knew.” The Holy One blessed be He knew that it was incumbent upon Him to redeem them for the sake of His name, and because of the covenant that he made with the patriarchs. Likewise it says: “God remembered His covenant” (Exodus 2:24). And that is what He said by means of Ezekiel: “But I acted for the sake of My name” (Ezekiel 20:9). <br>Alternatively, “God saw,” – Reish Lakish said that He saw that they were destined to be defiant at the Red Sea, as it is written: “They were defiant at the Red Sea” (Psalms 106:7). “And God knew,” He knew that they were destined to say: “This is my God” (Exodus 15:2). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: He saw that they were destined to say: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This was stated in reference to the golden calf. </i> “And God knew” that they were destined to say “we will do” before “we will listen.”<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">By accepting the obligation to perform the commandments before even hearing what they were, the Israelites demonstrated their faith in God (see Exodus 24:7). </i> <br>The Rabbis say: “God saw” that the mediocre people repented, and even the wicked contemplated repenting, as it is written: “The fig tree developed its unripe figs” (Song of Songs 2:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The unripe figs represent the wicked; they began to develop, even though their repentance was not outwardly discernible. The verse continues: “And the vines in blossom emitted fragrance,” which is a reference to the mediocre people, who actually repented, and therefore their repentance was outwardly discernible, like a fragrance.</i> “And God knew” [indicates] that one did not even know about another; only the Holy One blessed be He knew. This one was focusing his heart, and that one was focusing his heart, and they were repenting. But even though they repented, were it not for the merit of the patriarchs, they would not have emerged from there, because the attribute of justice was denouncing them because of the calf that they were destined to craft. <br>Regarding this, it is written: “You shall take a bundle of hyssop” (Exodus 12:22), because they lowered themselves like a hyssop, to repent. “And dip it into the blood that is in the basin,” (ibid.), due to the merit of the Torah that they were destined to receive, as it is written at the revelation at Sinai: “Moses took the blood” (Exodus 24:8). And it is written: “And touch the lintel” (Exodus 12:22), as Abraham was the greatest of the converts; just as the lintel is high, so too, he was the greatest of the patriarchs; “and the two doorposts” (ibid.), in the merit of Isaac and Jacob, to teach you that it was due to the merit of all of them [the patriarchs] that they emerged. <br>Alternatively, “God saw” the forced separation between them. “And God knew” that the time that He said to Abraham was approaching, and He appeared to Moses to inform him, while he was herding the flocks.

Chapter 2

<b>“Moses was herding the flock of his father-in-law Yitro, the priest of Midyan, and he led the flock into the wilderness, and he arrived at the mountain of God, to Ḥorev” (Exodus 3:1).</b> <br>“Moses was” – that is what is written: “He makes known to Moses His ways, His deeds [<i>alilotav</i>] to the children of Israel” (Psalms 103:7). The attributes and deeds of flesh and blood are distorted, as it is stated: “He pressed false charges against her” (Deuteronomy 22:14). However, the attributes and deeds of the Holy One blessed be He are merciful, as it is stated: “The Lord is compassionate and gracious” (Psalms 103:8). He made known to Moses those attributes at the moment that he [Moses] said to Him: “Please make known to me Your ways” (Exodus 33:13). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious” (Exodus 33:19). That is, “the Lord is compassionate and gracious.” <br> “He makes known to Moses His ways…” – He made known to Moses the path to the culmination [the redemption], as it is stated: “Moses was herding.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God informed Moses of the path to the culmination of the Egyptian exile when He appeared to him as he was herding the flock.</i>” “…His deeds [<i>alilotav</i>] to the children of Israel” – He performed His deeds in Egypt so that Israel would relate the deeds that the Holy One blessed be He did to Egypt. That is what is written: “So that you relate in the ears of your sons […what I wrought [<i>hitallalti</i>] upon Egypt]” (Exodus 10:2). “Compassionate” – He had compassion on Israel and the plagues did not touch them. “And gracious” – that they found grace in the eyes of Egypt. “Forbearing” (Psalms 103:8) – He was forbearing with them, as He tilts the scales in favor of kindness, and He looked to the good and not to the evil that they were destined to perform.
“Moses was herding” – that is what is written: “God was in His sacred Sanctuary” (Habakkuk 2:20). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Until the Temple was destroyed, the Divine Presence rested in it, as it is stated: “God was in His sacred Sanctuary” (Psalms 11:4). When the Temple was destroyed, the Divine Presence removed itself to the heavens, as it is stated: “The Lord established His throne in the heavens” (Psalms 103:19). <br>Rabbi Elazar says: The Divine Presence did not move from the Sanctuary, as it is stated: “My eyes and My heart will be there…” (II Chronicles 7:16); and likewise it says: “I will call to the Lord with my voice, and He answered me from his sacred mountain, Selah” (Psalms 3:5). Even though it is in ruins, it retains its sanctity; come and see what Cyrus says: “He is the God who is in Jerusalem” (Ezra 1:3). He [Cyrus] said to them: ‘Even though it is in ruins, God does not move from there.’ <br>Rabbi Aḥa said: The Divine Presence never moves from the western wall,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The reference may be to the western wall of the Temple, not what is now known as the Western Wall, which is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount.</i> as it is stated: “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9), and it is written: “His eyes behold, His eyelids assess the sons of man“ (Psalms 11:4). Rabbi Yannai said: Even though His Presence is in the heavens, “His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of man.” This is analogous to a king who had an orchard and built a tall tower in it; the king commanded laborers into it, to engage in his labor. The king said: Anyone who is industrious in his labor will receive his payment in full, and anyone who is indolent in his labor will be placed in prison.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew is <i>dimos</i>, which is obscure. Some suggest it means to be placed in a state of terror.</i> The king – that is the King of kings; the orchard – that is the world that the Holy One blessed be He gave to Israel in which to observe the Torah. He stipulated to them, saying: One who observes the Torah, the Garden of Eden is before him; and one who does not observe it, behold, Gehenna. <br>Indeed, the Holy One blessed be He, although He appears to be removing His divine presence from the Temple, “His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of man.” Whom does he test? He tests the righteous, as it is stated: “The Lord will test the righteous” (Psalms 11:5). <With what does He test him?> It is with sheepherding. <br>He tested David with flocks and found him a fine shepherd, as it is stated: “He took him from the sheepfolds [<i>mikhleot tzon</i>]” (Psalms 78:70). What are <i>mikhleot tzon</i>? It is like: “The rain was restrained [<i>vayikkaleh</i>]” (Genesis 8:2). He would hold back the large ones [sheep] due to the small ones, and would take out the small ones so they could graze on the soft grass, then the old ones so they could graze on the middling grass, then he would take out the choice ones to graze on the tough grass. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘One who knows how to herd the flocks, each according to its ability, will come and herd My people.’ That is what is written: “From the suckling ewes He brought him, to herd Jacob His people” (Psalms 78:71). <br>Moses, too, the Holy One blessed be He tested him only with flocks. Our Rabbis say: When Moses, may he rest in peace, was herding Yitro’s flock in the wilderness, a kid fled from him. He pursued it until it reached cover. Once it reached cover, it happened upon a pool of water, and the kid stopped to drink. When Moses reached it, he said: ‘I didn’t know that you were running due to thirst. You are tired.’ He carried it on his shoulder and was walking. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You have the compassion to behave with the flocks belonging to flesh and blood in this manner; by your life, you will herd My flock, Israel.’ That is: “Moses was herding.”
Another matter, “Moses was herding” – that is what is written: “Every word of God is pure” (Proverbs 30:5); the Holy One blessed be He does not bestow greatness upon a person until He tests them with a minor matter, and only then does He elevate him to prominence. There were two preeminently great ones whom the Holy One blessed be He tested with a minor matter, and they were found trustworthy and He elevated them to prominence. <br>He tested David with the flocks, and he led them only to the wilderness to distance them from robbery, as Eliav<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">David’s older brother.</i> said to David: “With whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness?” (I Samuel 17:28). This teaches that David observed [the halakha cited in] the mishna (<i>Bava Kamma </i>79a–79b): One may not raise a small domesticated animal in the Land of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For that reason David shepherded his flock in the wilderness.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You have been found trustworthy with the flocks, come and herd My flock,’ as it is stated: “From the suckling ewes He brought him” (Psalms 78:71). <br>Likewise, regarding Moses it says: “He led the flock deep into the wilderness,” to remove them from theft [by grazing in fields belonging to others], and the Holy One blessed be He took him to herd Israel, as it is stated: “You led Your people like a flock in the hand of Moses and Aaron” (Psalms 77:21).
Another interpretation: “Moses was [<i>haya</i>].” Everyone in whose regard <i>haya </i>is written, was fated for this [for what follows]: “Behold, the man has become [<i>haya</i>] [like one of us, knowing good and bad, what if he should extend his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever?]” (Genesis 3:22); death was fated to come to the world, as it is stated: “With darkness upon the surface of the deep” (Genesis 1:2) – that is death, which darkens the faces of the people. “The serpent was [<i>haya</i>] … cunning” (Genesis 3:1); he was fated for punishment. Regarding Noah it is written: “…was [<i>haya</i>] faultless” (Genesis 6:9); he was fated for salvation. Regarding Joseph it is written: “Joseph was [<i>haya</i>]” (Exodus 1:5); he was fated to [provide] sustenance. Regarding Mordekhai it is written: “There was [<i>haya</i>] a Jewish man” (Esther 2:5); he was fated to [bring] deliverance; and Moses, to [bring] salvation. From their original creation they were fated for this. <br>“And he led the flock into the wilderness [<i>midbar</i>].” Rabbi Yehoshua said: Why did he seek the wilderness? It is because he saw that Israel would come up from the wilderness, as it is stated: “Who is this coming up from the wilderness” (Song of Songs 3:6). For it was from the wilderness that they had the manna, the quail, the well, the Tabernacle, the Divine Presence, priesthood, kingship, and the clouds of glory. <br>Alternatively, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘You are destined to take Israel up from Egypt due to the merit of he with whom I spoke [<i>dibbarti</i>] between the pieces, that is Abraham.’ And <i>midbar</i> means nothing but speech [<i>dibbur</i>], as it is stated: “Your mouth [<i>umidbarekh</i>] is lovely” (Song of Songs 4:3). Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘This is a sign for you, you will leave them in the wilderness, and from the wilderness you are destined to restore them in the future, as it is stated: “Therefore, I will allure her and I will lead her into the wilderness” (Hosea 2:16). <br>Alternatively, why did he seek the wilderness? It is because he saw that he was destined to destroy the cities of the nations of the world, as it is written; “The end of the nations will be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert” (Jeremiah 50:12). <br>Another interpretation: “And he led the flock into the wilderness” – He informed him that Israel, which is called a flock, will die in the wilderness. Likewise, when Moses entreated [God for] Israel’s needs, <sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The exchange between Moses and God that follows is based on Song of Songs 1:7–8: “Tell me, You whom my soul loves, where do You shepherd, where do You rest them at noon? For why should I be like one who veils herself by the flocks of Your companions? If you do not know, the fairest among women, go you out after the sheep and shepherd your kids, by the tents of the shepherds.”</i> he said to him: ‘O Holy One blessed be He, “tell me, He whom my soul loves…” (Song of Songs 1:7) – how many birth mothers are among them, how many pregnant women, how many wet nurses have you provided for the babies, how many delicacies have you prepared for the pregnant women?’ The Holy One blessed be He responded to him: “If you do not know” (Song of Songs 1:8); if you do not know, ultimately you will know. “Go out in the footsteps of the flock”; in other words, you will herd the sheep and the lambs <the fathers who will die in the wilderness and the sons who will enter the Land>, but you will only herd the offspring, “by the tents of the shepherds;” in the land of Siḥon, <and you will not enter beyond there [into the Land]>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Moses will only lead the second generation in the conquest of the lands on the eastern side of the Jordan, he but will not lead them into the Land. </i> <br> “…he arrived at the mountain of God, to Ḥorev.” It has five names: “The mountain of God, Mount Bashan, Mount Gavnunim” (Psalms 68:16), Mount Ḥorev, Mount Sinai. <br>The mountain of God – because it was there that Israel accepted the Holy One blessed be He as their God. <br>Mount Bashan – as everything that a person eats with his teeth [<i>beshinav</i>] is thanks to the Torah that was given on the mountain.

Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It was from there that idolaters received their death sentence, as it is stated: “The nations will be destroyed [<i>ḥarov yeḥeravu</i>]” (Isaiah 60:12) – from Ḥorev they will be destroyed. <br>Mount Sinai – from which hatred [<i>sina</i>] for idolaters descended.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is because they refused to accept the Torah.</i>
<b>“An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of the bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, but the bush was not consumed” (Exodus 3:2). </b> <br>“An angel of the Lord appeared to him” – that is what is written: “I am asleep, but my heart is awake” (Song of Songs 5:2). I am asleep from the mitzvot, but my heart is awake to perform them. “My perfect one [<i>tamati</i>]” (Song of Songs 5:2) at Sinai, as they had perfect faith [<i>shenitamemu</i>] with Me at Sinai, and they said: “Everything that the Lord spoke, we will do and we will obey” (Exodus 24:7). Rabbi Yannai said: Just as it is with twins [<i>teomim</i>], if the head of one hurts, the other feels it, so too, the Holy One blessed be He said, as it were: “I will be with him in trouble” (Psalms 91:15). <br>Alternatively: What is: “I will be with him in trouble?” When they have trouble they call out only to the Holy One blessed be He. In Egypt – “their cry came up to God” (Exodus 2:23); at the sea – “and the children of Israel cried to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10), and many others like that. And it says: “In all their trouble, He was troubled” (Isaiah 63:9). The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Don’t you sense that I am suffering just as Israel is suffering? Know that from the place that I am speaking with you, from the thorns, as it were, I am party to their suffering.’ <br> “An angel of the Lord appeared.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That is Michael. Rabbi Ḥanina said: That is Gabriel. [Regarding] Rabbi Yosei the tall, everywhere that they would see him, they would say: ‘Here is our saintly rabbi.’<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yosei was an attendant of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> Similarly, everywhere that Michael appears, there is the glory of the Divine Presence. <br>“To him” – what is “to him?” It teaches that there were people with him and they did not see, only Moses alone. As it is written regarding Daniel: “I, Daniel, alone, saw the vision” (Daniel 10:7). <br>“In a flame [<i>belabat</i>] of fire” – to give him courage [<i>lelabevo</i>], so that when he arrives at Sinai and sees those fires, he will not fear them. Alternatively, <i>belabat esh</i>, from two thirds of the bush and above, just as the heart [<i>lev</i>] is placed at two thirds of the person and above. <br>“From the midst of the bush” – a gentile asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: ‘What did the Holy One blessed be He see that led Him to speak with Moses from the midst of the bush?’ He said to him: ‘Had he spoken to him from a carob tree or a sycamore tree, would you ask me the same? However, to dismiss you outright is impossible. Why from the midst of the bush? It is to teach you that there is no place that is vacant of the Divine Presence, even a bush.’ <br>“In a flame of fire” – initially, only one angel descended, which stood in the center of the fire, and then the Divine Presence descended and spoke with him “from the midst of the bush”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In Exodus 3:2 it says: “He saw an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in the midst of the bush” and then in verse 4 it says: “God called him from the midst of the bush.”</i> (Exodus 3:4). <br>Rabbi Eliezer says: Just as a bush is the lowliest of all the trees in the world, so too, Israel was lowly and humble to the Egyptians; therefore, the Holy One blessed be He appeared to them and redeemed them, as it is stated: “I came down to deliver them from the hand of Egypt” (Exodus 3:8). Rabbi Yosei says: Just as the bush is the harshest of all the trees, and any bird that enters the bush does not emerge from it unharmed, so too, the enslavement in Egypt was the harshest of all the enslavements in the world before the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “The Lord said: I have seen [<i>ra’o ra’iti</i>] the affliction of My people” (Exodus 3:7). Why does the verse state <i>ra’o ra’iti</i> twice?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The question is based on the doubled verb, combining the absolute infinitive <i>ra’o </i>with the first person past tense <i>ra’iti, </i>meaning ‘I have seen<i>.</i>’<i> </i>This formulation is common in Biblical Hebrew and is often understood to indicate emphasis. In any case, the midrash takes the opportunity to expound upon the double verb. </i> It is because after they would drown them [the Hebrew children] in the river they would then crush them under the construction. This is analogous to one who took a rod and struck two people and both of them receive the lash and know its pain.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"> It is as if God also feels the pain of Israel.</i> So too, the pain and enslavement of Israel was revealed before the One Who spoke and the world came into being, as it is stated: “As I know its pains” (ibid.). <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Just as this bush, one makes it into a fence for a garden, so too, Israel is a fence for the world. Alternatively: Just as this bush grows on any water,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">It grows both from rainwater and irrigation. </i> so too Israel grows only due to the merit of the Torah, which is characterized as water, as it is stated: “Ho, everyone who thirsts, go to the water” (Isaiah 55:1). <br>Another matter: Just as this bush grows in a garden and by a river, so too, Israel is in this world and in the World to Come. Alternatively, just as the bush produces thorns and produces roses, so too, in Israel there are both righteous and wicked. Rabbi Pinḥas the priest, son of Rabbi Ḥama said: Just as the bush, when one inserts his hand into it, one doesn’t feel anything, but when one removes it, it is scratched, so too, when Israel descended to Egypt, no creature knew them, but when they emerged, they emerged “with signs, with wonders, and with war” (Deuteronomy 4:34). Rabbi Yehuda bar Shalom said: Just as the bush, when a bird enters it he doesn’t feel it and when it emerges, its wings are plucked, so too, when Abraham descended to Egypt, no creature knew him, and when he emerged: “The Lord plagued Pharaoh” (Genesis 12:17). <br>Another matter: “From the midst of the bush” – Rabbi Naḥman, the son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says: All trees – some of them produce one leaf, some two or three. The myrtle produces three, as it is called: “a leafy tree” (Leviticus 23:40); however, the bush has five leaves. the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: Israel is redeemed only due to the merit of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and your merit and the merit of Aaron. Alternatively, “from the midst of the bush [<i>hasneh</i>]” – He alluded to him [to Moses] that he would live one hundred and twenty years, corresponding to the numerical value of <i>hasneh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Heh </i>– 5, <i>samekh </i>– 60, <i>nun</i> – 50, <i>heh </i>– 5 = 120.</i> <br>“He looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire.” From here they say that heavenly fire generates rays of light and burns but does not consume,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">It burns without consuming fuel.</i> and it is black. Earthly fire does not produce light rays, it is red, and it consumes but does not burn. Why did the Holy One blessed be He show Moses this matter? It is because he was contemplating in his heart and saying: Perhaps the Egyptians will eradicate Israel; therefore, the Holy One blessed be He showed him a burning fire that is not consumed. He said to him: ‘Just as the bush burns in fire but is not consumed, so too, the Egyptians will be unable to eradicate Israel.’ <br>Another matter: Because the Holy One blessed be He [wanted to] speak with Moses, but he [Moses] did not want to interrupt his work [of shepherding], He showed him this thing so that he would turn his head and see, and He could speak with him, as you find initially: “An angel of the Lord appeared to him,” and Moses did not go. Once he stopped working he went to see, immediately: “God called to him” (Exodus 3:4).
<b>“Moses said: I will turn now, and see this great sight; why will the bush not burn?” (Exodus 3:3). </b> <br>“Moses said: I will turn [<i>asura</i>] now and see.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Moses took five steps at that moment, as it is stated: “I will turn [<i>asura</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">It should have said <i>asur</i>. The numerical value of the additional <i>heh</i> alludes to the five steps that Moses took.</i> now and see.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: He turned around and looked, as it is stated: “The Lord saw that he had turned to see” (Exodus 3:4). Once he looked at it, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘He is suitable to shepherd Israel.’ <br><b> “The Lord saw that he turned to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush and He said: ‘Moses, Moses.’ He said: ‘Here I am’” (Exodus 3:4). </b> <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What is “that he had turned [<i>sar</i>] to see?” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘This one is depressed and upset [<i>sar veza’ef</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">An allusion to I Kings 20:43, 21:4.</i> over seeing Israel’s suffering in Egypt; therefore, he is suitable to be their shepherd.

However, “Moses Moses,” there is no <i>pasek</i> between them. Why is it so? This is analogous to a person who placed upon himself a great burden, and calls: So-and-so so-and-so, my dear, unload this burden from me.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Due to the urgency of the matter he calls without pausing.</i> Alternatively, with all the prophets, He ceased speaking with them; however, with Moses, He did not cease all his days. <br>Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai taught: What is “Moses Moses?” It is an expression of fondness and encouragement. Alternatively: “Moses Moses” – it is he who taught Torah in this world, and he is destined to teach in the World to Come, as Israel is destined to go to Abraham and say to him: ‘Teach us Torah.’ He will say: ‘Go to Isaac, who studied more than I did,’ and Isaac will say: ‘Go to Jacob, who attended [to his teachers] more than I did;’ and Jacob will say to them: ‘Go to Moses, who learned it from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He.’ That is what is written: “They will go from strength to strength, they will appear to God [<i>Elohim</i>] in Zion” (Psalms 84:8), and <i>elohim</i> is in fact Moses, as it is stated: “See I have placed you as <i>elohim</i> to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:1). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Anyone whose name is doubled is in two worlds.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This world and the world-to-come.</i> <br><b>“He said: Do not draw near; remove your shoes from your feet, for the place upon which you are standing is holy ground” (Exodus 3:5). </b> <br>“He said: Here I am” (Exodus 3:4) – here I am for priesthood and kingship. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You are standing in the place of the pillar of the world: Abraham said: “I am here” (Genesis 22:1), and you said: “I am here.”’ Moses asked that priests and kings emerge from him. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Do not draw [<i>tikrav</i>] near [<i>halom</i>]” – meaning, your descendants will not be sacrificing [<i>makrivin</i>], as the priesthood is fated for Aaron your brother. <i>Halom</i> – this is kingship, as it is said: “That you have brought me [King David] to this point [<i>halom</i>]” (II Samuel 7:18), and it says: “Has a man [Saul] come here [<i>halom</i>] yet?” (I Samuel 10:22). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Kingdom is fated for David.’ Nevertheless, Moses received both of them. Priesthood, as he served during the seven days of inauguration; kingdom, as it is written: “There was a king in Yeshurun” (Deuteronomy 33:5). <br>“Remove your shoes” – any place that the Divine Presence reveals itself, wearing shoes is prohibited. Thus with Joshua: “Remove your shoes” (Joshua 5:15). And thus the priests served in the Temple only barefoot.

Chapter 3

<b>“He said: I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his face, for he was afraid of looking at God” (Exodus 3:6).</b> <br>“He said: I am the God of your father” – that is what is written: “A fool [<i>peti</i>] believes everything” (Proverbs 14:15). What is a <i>peti</i>? It is a lad, as in Arabia they call a lad <i>petaya</i>. Alternatively, <i>peti</i> is nothing but an expression of seduction, as it is stated: “If a man seduces [<i>yefateh</i>] a woman” (Exodus 22:15). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua Ha-Kohen bar Neḥemya said: At the moment that The Holy One blessed be He appeared to Moses, Moses was a novice at prophecy. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I appear to him in loud voice, I will terrify him; in soft voice, he will take prophecy lightly.’ What did He do? He appeared to him with the voice of his father. Moses said: ‘Here I am; what does <i>Abba</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Aramaic term by which Jews to this day refer to their fathers.</i> want?’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I am not your father [Amram], but rather the God of your father. I have come to you with inducements so you will not be afraid.’ “The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” – Moses was joyful and said: ‘<i>Abba</i> is enumerated with the patriarchs. Moreover, he is greater, as he was mentioned first.’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse, God introduces himself as “the God of your father,” and then as “the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”</i> <br>“Moses hid his face” – he said: ‘The God of my father is standing here and I am not hiding my face?’ Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa and Rabbi Hoshaya, one of them says: Moses did not act properly when he hid his face, as had he not hidden his face, The Holy One blessed be He would have revealed to him what is above, what is below, what was, and what is destined to be. Ultimately, he requested to see, as it is stated: “Please show me Your glory” (Exodus 33:18). The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘I came to appear to you, and you hid your face. Now I say to you: “For man will not see Me and live” (Exodus 33:20); when I wanted, you did not want.’ <br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Nevertheless, He showed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even though according to the previous opinion, hiding his face was inappropriate, God showed him the three mysteries mentioned above.</i> As reward for “Moses hid his face” – “the Lord spoke to Moses face to face” (Exodus 33:11); as reward for “For he was afraid,” – “they were afraid to approach him (Exodus 34:30); as reward for “of looking [<i>mehabit</i>]” – “and the likeness of the Lord he beholds [<i>yabit</i>]” (Numbers 12:8). <br>Rabbi Hoshaya the Great said: He acted properly when he hid his face. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I came to reveal My face to you, and you honored Me and hid your face; by your life, you are destined to be with Me on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, without eating and without drinking, and you are destined to enjoy the aura of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Moses did not know that the skin of his face glowed” (Exodus 34:29). However, Nadav and Avihu uncovered their heads and feasted their eyes on the aura of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Against the nobles of the children of Israel He did not extend His hand” (Exodus 24:11), and they did not receive punishment for what they did.
<b> “The Lord said: I have seen My people’s affliction that is in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry because of their taskmasters, as I know their pain” (Exodus 3:7).</b> <br>“The Lord said: I have seen My people’s affliction” – that is what is written: “For He knows vain men [<i>metei shav</i>]” (Job 11:11); The Holy One blessed be He knows the people who die [<i>metim</i>] to perform vanity. Alternatively, The Holy One blessed be He knows the people who are destined to perform vanity and be killed, as it is stated: “Your men [<i>metayikh</i>] will fall by the sword” (Isaiah 3:25). <br>In contrast, “He sees iniquity but does not consider it” (Job 11:11). How so? You find that at the moment that Hagar left Abraham’s house, she and her son, what is written? “The water in the skin finished…she went and sat down at a distance” (Genesis 21:15–16). Rabbi Berekhya said: She began reproaching Heaven; she said: ‘Master of the universe, yesterday You said to me: “I will multiply your descendants,” and today he is dying.’ Immediately, “the angel of God called to Hagar” (Genesis 21:17). Rabbi Simon said: The ministering angels sought to denounce him [Ishmael]. They said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, a person who is destined to cause your children to die of thirst,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is unclear. Possibly it refers to the story in <i>Lamentations Rabba</i> 2:4 in which the Ishmaelites caused refugees from Nebuchadnezzar to die of thirst.</i> are You bringing up a well for him? It is proper to bring it up for six hundred thousand who are destined to recite before You: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”’ (Exodus 15:2). He said to them: ‘Now, is he righteous or wicked’? They said before Him: ‘He is righteous.’ He said to them: ‘I only judge a person at his time.’<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Although God perceives future sins, He judges only those actions already performed.</i> Therefore it is written: “He sees iniquity but does not consider it.” <br>Likewise, when Israel was in Egypt, The Holy One blessed be He saw what they were destined to do; that is what is written: “The Lord said: I have seen [<i>ra’o ra’iti</i>].” It does not say <i>ra’iti</i>, but rather, <i>ra’o ra’iti</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the verb is doubled, combining the absolute infinitive <i>ra’o </i>with the first person past <i>ra’iti, </i>meaning ‘I have seen<i>.</i>’<i> </i>This formulation is common in Biblical Hebrew and is often understood to indicate emphasis. Nevertheless, the midrash takes the opportunity to expound the double verb. </i> The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘You see one sight but I see two sights. You see them arriving at Sinai and receiving My Torah, and I see them receiving My Torah, that is <i>ra’o</i>; [but I also see] <i>ra’iti</i>, that is the sight of the deed of the calf, as it is stated; “I have seen [<i>ra’iti</i>] this people” (Exodus 32:9).

Nevertheless, I am not judging them on the basis of the actions that they are destined to do but rather according to the situation now. For I have heard their cry, even though I know their pain that they are destined to cause.’ That is <i>ra’o</i> <i>ra’iti</i>. <br>What is: “As I know their pain?” I know how much they are destined to pain Me in the wilderness,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is interpreting <i>makhovav</i>, “its pain,” to refer to pain inflicted by Israel, rather than pain they experienced.</i> as it is stated: “How often did they defy Him in the wilderness, and aggrieve Him in the wasteland” (Psalms 78:40). Nevertheless, I will not refrain from delivering them. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Otniel ben Kenaz argued this matter before the Holy One blessed be He. He said: ‘Master of the universe, this is what you promised to Moses, whether they do Your will or they do not do Your will, you deliver them, as it is stated: “The spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he judged Israel”’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Otniel ben Kenaz.</i> (Judges 3:10). Therefore, it is written: “As I know their pain.” Nevertheless, I will deliver them.

<b>“Moses said to God: 'Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should take the children of Israel out of Egypt?’” (Exodus 3:11)</b> <br>“Moses said to God: Who am I [<i>anokhi</i>]?” Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: This is analogous to a king who married off his daughter and committed to give her one province and gentlewoman as a maidservant, and he gave her a Kushite maidservant. His son-in-law said: ‘Didn’t you commit to give me a gentlewoman as a maidservant?’ So, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, when Jacob descended to Egypt, didn’t you say this to them: “I [<i>Anokhi</i>] will descend with you into Egypt and I [<i>Anokhi</i>] will take you up” (Genesis 46:4), and now you say to me: “Go now, and I will send you to Pharaoh”?

It is in Song of Songs, as it is stated: “Tell me, whom my soul loves…” (Song of Songs 1:7). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘The bread that came out with them from Egypt will suffice them for thirty days; you know how I am destined to lead them.’ <br>Another interpretation: “Who am I?” – He [Moses] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, how am I able to enter a place of robbers and a place of murderers? That is: “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh…” “And that I should take the children of Israel out” – what merit do they possess that will enable me to take them out?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Because I will be with you” (Exodus 3:12).

<b>“Moses said to God: Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers has sent me to you; and they say to me: What is His name?

At that moment, Moses requested that the Holy One blessed be He make known to him His great name.
<b>“God said to Moses: 'I will be what I will be,' and He said: 'So shall you say to the children of Israel: I will be has sent me to you” (Exodus 3:14).</b> <br>“God said to Moses” – Rabbi Abba bar Mamal said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: You seek to know My name?

That is, “I will be what I will be,” I am named based on My actions. <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Say to them: It is I who have been with you in the past, and it is I now, and it is I in the future;’ therefore, “I will be” is written three times. <br>Another interpretation: “I will be what I will be,” – Rabbi Yaakov son of Rabbi Avina said in the name of Rabbi Huna of Tzipporin: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Say to them: In this servitude I will be with them and into servitude they are going and I will be with them.’ He said before Him: ‘Is that what I should say to them?

Know that I am speaking about the forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; that is what is written: “The Lord, the God of your fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, has sent me to you.” When Moses heard that He did not mention his father as He had initially,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 3:6.

<b>“Go and gather the elders of Israel, and say to them: The Lord, the God of your fathers, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying: I have remembered you, and what is being done to you in Egypt” (Exodus 3:16).</b> <br>“Go and gather the elders of Israel.” The elders always uphold Israel, and thus it says: “And all Israel, and its elders, and its officers, and its judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark” (Joshua 8:33). When is Israel capable of standing? It is when they have elders. Why, when the Temple was standing, did they consult with the elders, as it is stated: “Ask your father and he will tell you; your elders and they will say to you” (Deuteronomy 32:7)? It is because anyone who takes counsel from elders does not fail. Know that when ben-Hadad sent to the king of Israel, as it is stated: “So said ben-Hadad: Your silver and your gold are mine” (I Kings 20:3), the king of Israel sent to him: “As you said, my lord king: I, and everything that I have are yours” (Ibid. 20:4). He sent to him a second time: “But tomorrow at this time, I will send my servants to you and they will search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it will be, that everything precious [<i>maḥmad</i>] to you, they will seize, and take it” (I Kings 20:6). Was everything that he demanded initially not precious? He demanded silver and gold and they are precious, as it is stated: “And the precious items [<i>ḥemdat</i>] of all the peoples will come” (Haggai 2:7). <sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The following verse in Haggai states: “Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, the utterance of the Lord of hosts.”</i> He demanded women and they are precious, as it is stated: “Son of man, behold, I am taking away from you the desire [<i>maḥmad</i>] of your eyes…” (Ezekiel 24:16). He demanded children, and they are precious, as it is stated: “And I will slay the beloved fruit [<i>maḥmad</i>] of their womb” (Hosea 9:16). You must say: Everything he demanded initially was precious, and “everything precious to you” is an item that is ultimately precious, that is the Torah, as it is stated: “More precious than gold and more than much fine gold” (Psalms 19:11). <br>When the king of Israel heard this, he said: ‘This is not mine, but rather it belongs to the elders.’ Immediately, “The king of Israel called all the elders of the land…and all the elders and all the people said to him: Neither heed nor consent” (I Kings 20:7–8). Once he heeded the counsel of the elders, immediately: “The king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and the chariots” (I Kings 20:21). That is Israel consulting the elders. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Go and gather the elders of Israel.” <br>“Say to them…I have remembered [<i>pakod pakadeti</i>].” He said to him: ‘They have a tradition from Joseph that I will deliver them with this expression.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">“God will remember [<i>pakod yifkod</i>] you” (Genesis 50:24).</i> Go and say to them: This is the sign.’ What is <i>pakod pakadeti</i>? <i>Pakod </i>in Egypt, <i>pakadeti </i>at the sea; <i>pakod </i>in the future, <i>pakadeti</i> in the past. “And what is being done to you in Egypt” – in other words, I will remember for the Egyptians what they are doing to you, as it is stated: “I remember what Amalek did to you” (I Samuel 15:2). <sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The verse actually states: “I remember what Amalek did to Israel.” This statement precedes God’s command to King Saul to annihilate Amalek.</i> <br><b>“And I said: I will take you up out of the affliction of Egypt, to the land of the Canaanites and the Hitites and the Emorites and the Perizites and the Hivites and the Yevusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.

Immediately, “they will heed your voice.” Why? It is because they have a tradition of deliverance, that any deliverer who comes and says to them a double expression of remembrance [<i>pakod pakadeti</i>] is a genuine deliverer. Then “you shall go, you and the elders of Israel…” – He showed respect for the elders. “You shall say to him: The Lord, God of the Hebrews, happened upon us.” Why does it call them Hebrews [<i>ivrim</i>]? It is because they crossed [<i>avru</i>] the sea. <br>“And now, please, let us go a journey of three days...” Why did they say three days and did not say, please let us go forever? Why did they say this? It was so the Egyptians would be misled and pursue them when they left, and would say: ‘He delivered them only so they would go three days and sacrifice to Him, and it is they who have delayed for so long.’ And they will pursue them after three days and He will drown them in the sea to punish them with a punishment to fit their crime, as they said: “Every boy that is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22).
<b>“And I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, except by a mighty hand” (Exodus 3:19).</b> <br>“And I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go.” The Holy One blessed be He saw what the wicked Pharaoh is destined to do; [that he will] increase the workload of the people from the moment that he [Moses] goes [to Pharaoh] as His emissary.

<b>“I will extend My hand, and smite Egypt with all My wonders that I will perform in its midst; after that he will let you go” (Exodus 3:20).</b> <br>“I will extend My hand…” I will do what I spoke of to Abraham: “And also that nation which they will serve, I will judge” (Genesis 15:14), in order to punish them with a punishment to fit their crime. Therefore, I will render them obstinate, and after I complete administering their punishment, “he will let you go.”
<b>“I will give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it will be when you go, you will not go empty-handed” (Exodus 3:21).</b> <br>“I will give this people favor” – what I said to Abraham: “And afterward they will emerge with great wealth” (Genesis 15:14). I am destined to grant you favor in the Egyptian’s eyes, so they will lend to them and they will leave well-stocked. This is so that Abraham our patriarch will have no claim, saying: “They will serve them, and they will afflict them” (Genesis 15:13), He [God] fulfilled for them, but “then they will emerge with great wealth” (Genesis 15:14), He did not fulfill for them. <br><b>“Every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of she who lives in her house, silver vessels, and gold vessels, and garments; and you shall place them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and you shall despoil the Egyptians” (Exodus 3:22).</b> <br>“Every woman shall ask of her neighbor…” – this teaches that garments were especially dear to them, as when a person sets out on the road, if he lacks garments, he is embarrassed. “And you shall despoil [<i>venitzaltem</i>] the Egyptians” – they are destined to make Egypt like the depths [<i>metzulot</i>] that have no fish.
<b>“Moses answered and said: But they will not believe me, nor heed my voice; for they will say: The Lord did not appear to you” (Exodus 4:1).</b> <br>“Moses answered and said: But they will not believe me.” At that moment, Moses spoke improperly. The Holy One blessed be He had said to him: “They will heed your voice” (Exodus 3:18), and he said: “But they will not believe me”? Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He responded to him in kind, providing him with signs based on his words. Look what is written afterward: “The Lord said to him: What is that [<i>mazeh</i>] in your hand? He said: A staff” (Exodus 4:2). In other words, from that [<i>mizeh</i>] which you have done, you must be punished, as you have slandered My children; they are believers, the children of believers. Believers, as it is stated: “The people believed” (Exodus 4:31); children of believers, as it is stated: “He [Abraham] believed in the Lord” (Genesis 15:6). <br><b>“He said: Cast it on the ground. He cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent. Moses fled from before it” (Exodus 4:3).</b> <br>Moses adopted the way of the serpent who slandered his Creator, as it is stated: “For God knows [that on the day you eat of it, your eyes will open, and you shall be as God, knowers of good and evil]” (Genesis 3:5). Just as the serpent was punished, so, too, this one [Moses] is destined to be punished. See what is written: “He said: Cast it on the ground. He cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent.” Because he performed the action of the serpent, He therefore showed him the serpent, meaning, you performed this one’s action. <br>“Moses fled from before it.” A [Roman] gentlewoman said to Rabbi Yosei: ‘My god is greater than your God.’ He said to her: ‘Why?’ She said to him: ‘When your God revealed Himself to Moses at the bush, Moses concealed his face, but when he saw the serpent, which is my god, immediately: “Moses fled from before it.”’ He said to her: ‘May her bones wither.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Presumably Rabbi Yosei did not direct this curse directly at the Roman woman. This sotto voce comment made before he replied to her challenge is his response to her blasphemous contention that Moses feared the snake more than God. </i> When our God revealed Himself at the bush, there was no place to flee. Where could he flee; to the heavens, to the sea, or to dry land? What is stated regarding our God? “Don’t I fill the heavens and the earth – the utterance of the Lord” (Jeremiah 23:24). However, the serpent, that is your god, when a person flees two or three steps from it, he can be saved; therefore, it is written: “Moses fled from before it.”’ <br>Another interpretation: Why did he flee? It is because he sinned with his words, as had he not sinned, he would not have fled, because it is not the serpent that kills, but rather the sin that kills, as it is written in the incident involving Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Berakhot</i> 33a.</i> <br><b>“The Lord said to Moses: 'Extend your hand, and grasp its tail.’ He extended his hand, and grasped it, and it became a staff in his hand. So that they will believe that the Lord, God of their fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, has appeared to you” (Exodus 4:4-5).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: ‘Extend your hand, and grasp its tail.’” We already said how the serpent corresponded to Moses, but what sign was there for Israel in this? Rabbi Eliezer said: That is why the staff was transformed into a serpent, corresponding to Pharaoh, who was called a serpent, as it is stated: “The great serpent” (Ezekiel 29:3), and it says: “Against Leviathan the bar-serpent” (Isaiah 27:1), because he would bite Israel. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Have you seen Pharaoh, who is like a serpent? You are destined to strike him with a staff and in the end he will become like wood. Just as a staff does not bite, so, too he will not bite.’ That is what is written: “Extend your hand, and grasp its tail…. So that they will believe that the Lord…has appeared to you.” ‘Go perform this sign for them, so that they will believe that I have appeared to you.’
<b>“The Lord said to him further: Put your hand in your bosom. He put his hand in his bosom and took it out, and behold, his hand was leprous, like snow” (Exodus 4:6).</b> <br>“The Lord said to him further: Put your hand in your bosom.” He said to him: ‘It is just like the serpent who, when he engaged in slander, I afflicted him with leprosy, as it is stated: “Cursed [<i>arur</i>] are you from all the animals” (Genesis 3:14), as you say: “Malignant [<i>mameret</i>] leprosy”’ (Leviticus 13:51). Rabbi Elazar said: Those spots on it [the serpent] are leprous marks; so do you deserve to be afflicted with leprosy. Why did he place it in his bosom? It is because slander is typically told in secret. Likewise it says: “He who slanders his neighbor in secret, I will destroy [<i>atzmit</i>]” (Psalms 101:5). <i>Atzmit </i>[refers to] nothing but leprosy, as it is stated: “In perpetuity [<i>litzmitut</i>]” (Leviticus 25:23), which is translated as completely [<i>laḥalutin</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>Targum Onkelos.</i></i> and it is taught: “The difference between a quarantined leper and a confirmed leper [<i>muḥlat</i>] is only… (<i>Megilla </i>8b).”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash cites the mishna to show that the word <i>muḥlat, </i>which is derived from the same root as <i>laḥalutin, </i>is used in the context of leprosy.</i> <br>“He put his hand in his bosom and took it out, and behold, his hand was leprous, like snow.” He received his due because he engaged in slander. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: From here you learn that anyone who suspects another of something which is untrue of him, is afflicted in his body. <br><b>“He said: Put your hand back in your bosom. He put his hand back in his bosom; and he removed it from his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his flesh” (Exodus 4:7). </b> <br>“He said: Put your hand back in your bosom.” How is there a sign for Israel in this? [It is as if God were saying:] Go and say to them: Just as a leper causes impurity, so do the Egyptians render you impure. And just as he [the leper] is purified, so is the Holy One blessed be He destined to purify Israel, as it is written: “And behold, his hand was leprous, like snow,” and in the healing it is written: “He removed it from his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his flesh.” Our Rabbis say: So as not to cast aspersions on Moses’s flesh [i.e. his bosom]; therefore, his hand was not afflicted with leprosy until he removed it from his bosom. However, regarding the healing, it was healed in his bosom. Alternatively, from here punishments are delayed before being exacted upon the righteous, while the [divine] attribute of goodness takes effect quickly. <br><b>“And it shall be that if they do not believe even these two signs, and they do not heed your voice, you shall take from the water of the Nile and pour it out on dry land; and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry land” (Exodus 4:9).</b> <br>“It will be, if they will not believe even these two…” Why did the Holy One blessed be He perform three signs for him? It is corresponding to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. <br>“You shall take from the water of the Nile.” He indicated to him that, by means of something he will say to Israel, the water is destined to be transformed into blood, and he will be punished through it [the water], as it is written: “Hear now, defiant ones” (Numbers 20:10), and he struck the stone and extracted [water], as it is stated: “Behold, He struck the rock, and water flowed out [<i>vayazuvu</i>]” (Psalms 78:20). <i>Vayazuvu </i>is an expression of nothing other than blood, as it is stated: “If a woman will have a flow [<i>yazuv zov</i>] of her blood” (Leviticus 15:25). That is why he struck the stone twice, as initially it produced blood and finally water. In the first two signs, you find that they were restored to their original state, but the sign of the blood was not restored to its original state because He did not wish to forgive Moses for the sin of the water. And how was there a sign for Israel in this? He said to them: ‘With this sign the Egyptians will be afflicted first.’
“Moses said to the Lord: Please my Lord, I am not a man of words, neither yesterday, nor the day before, nor since You spoke to Your servant; for I am slow of speech, and slow of tongue” (Exodus 4:10).</b> <br>“Moses said to the Lord: Please my Lord [<i>Adonai</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The name of the Lord is spelled <i>alef</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>yod</i>.</i> Moses said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You are the lord [<i>adon</i>] of the world, and it is me you want to be an emissary? “I am not a man of words…”’ The Sages said: Seven days previously, the Holy One blessed be He was inducing Moses to go on His mission, but he did not want to go until the incident at the bush. That is what is written: “I am not a man of words,” one; “yesterday,” two; “neither [<i>gam</i>],” three; “the day before,” four; “nor [<i>gam</i>],” five; “since,” six; “You spoke,” seven. <br><b>“The Lord said to him: Who makes a man's mouth, or makes a man mute, or deaf, or sighted, or blind? Is it not I, the Lord? Now, go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall speak” (Exodus 4:11-12).</b> <br>Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen said; Moses said: ‘I am not a man of words, and I do not see [how] words [can be effective] here, because the person to whom I am going [Pharaoh]<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Presumably, Pharaoh is regarded as a slave because Ham is the ancestor of Egypt and the descendants of Ham are cursed with slavery. See Genesis 9:25. Alternatively, “the man” refers to the typical Israelite slave.</i> is a slave and he does not accept admonition, as it is stated: “A slave will not be admonished with words” (Proverbs 29:19). <Variant reading: If I am not going to afflict him, I will not go, immediately: “the Lord said [to him: Who makes a man's mouth, or makes a man mute, or deaf, or sighted, or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?]”>. If I am going to afflict him I will go immediately.’
“The Lord said to him: Who makes a man’s mouth?” He [God] said to him: ‘If you are not a man of words do not be concerned; haven’t I created all the mouths in the world, and I rendered mute whomever I wished, and [likewise determined who is] deaf and blind, and sighted and hearing? Had I wished for you to be a man of words, so would you be. Rather, I wish to perform a miracle with you. When you speak, your words will be exact,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Alternative translation: correct, fitting.</i> as I will be with your mouth.’ That is what is written: “And I will be with your mouth.” What is “and teach you [<i>vehoreitikha</i>]”? Rabbi Abbahu said: I will shoot [<i>moreh</i>] My words into your mouth like an arrow, as it states: “Or will be shot [<i>yaro yiyareh</i>]” (Exodus 19:13). Rabbi Simon says: I will create you into a new being, as it is stated: “The woman conceived [<i>vatahar</i>] [and bore a son]” (Exodus 2:2).
<b>“He said: Please Lord, send by means of whom You send” (Exodus 4:13).</b> <br>“He said: Please [<i>bi</i>] Lord [<i>Adonai</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The name of the Lord is spelled <i>alef</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>yod</i>.</i> send by means of whom You send.” Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, with me [<i>bi</i>], You seek to deliver the children of Abraham, who established You as the lord [<i>adon</i>] over all Your creations? “Send, please, by means of whom You send.”’<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Send whomever You usually send for such tasks. </i> He said before Him: ‘Who is dearer to a person, his nephew or his grandson? You must say, it is his grandson. When you sought to rescue Lot, Abraham’s nephew, You sent angels to rescue him. Abraham’s descendants, who are six hundred thousand, you are sending me to rescue them? Send the angels whom You are accustomed to send. <br>Another matter: ‘For Hagar the Egyptian, You sent five angels to her; to six hundred thousand descendants of Sarah, it is me You are sending to rescue them?’ The Rabbis say: Did you suppose that Moses was refusing to go? That is not the case. Rather, it was in deference to Aaron, as Moses was saying: ‘Before I arose, Aaron my brother has been prophesying for them in Egypt for eighty years.’ That is what is written: “I made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt” (Ezekiel 20:5). From where [can it be known] that Aaron was prophesying? For it says like this: “A man of God came to Eli, and said to him: So said the Lord: Didn’t I reveal Myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt, subject to Pharaoh's house? Did I not choose him from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest?”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Implying that Aaron was chosen already in Egypt.</i> (I Samuel 2:27–28). Moses said: ‘Will I now encroach upon my brother and upset him?’ For that reason he did not wish to go. Immediately, “the wrath of the Lord was enflamed against Moses” (Exodus 4:14).
<b>“The wrath of the Lord was enflamed against Moses, and He said: Surely Aaron your brother the Levite, I know that he can speak. And behold, he is coming out to meet you, and he will see you, and be glad in his heart” (Exodus 4:14).</b> <br>What enflamed wrath was there? [At that moment,] the priesthood was taken from Moses and given to Aaron. Our Rabbis of blessed memory say: “Surely Aaron your brother the Levite” – from the fact that He said “your brother,” don’t I know that he is a Levite? Rather, He said to him: ‘You were fit to be a priest, and he, a Levite. Because you refuse to fulfill My words, you will be a Levite, and he, a priest.’ <br>“I know that he can speak.” Because you said: “I am not a man of words,” therefore, he will speak. And that which you thought that he would be upset, that is not so; rather, he will be glad, as it is stated: “He will see you, and be glad in his heart.” Rabbi Shimon ben Rabbi Yosei said: The heart that was glad over the greatness of his brother will don the Urim ve’Tumim,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Part of the priestly vestments used as an oracle.</i> as it is stated: “They shall be upon Aaron’s heart” (Exodus 28:30). <br><b>“You shall speak to him and place the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will instruct you what you shall do. He shall speak for you to the people and he shall be a mouth for you, and you shall be in God’s stead for him” (Exodus 4:15–16).</b> <br>When you fear to speak all these matters, “I will be with your mouth.” “He shall speak for you to the people and he shall be a mouth for you” – a spokesperson. “And you shall be in God’s stead for him.” Even though he is your older brother, fear of you will be upon him. From here they said: Fear of your teacher is like the fear of Heaven. He [God] said to him: ‘Just as fear of Me is upon you, so, too, fear of you is upon him.’ <br><b>“You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs” (Exodus 4:17).</b> <br>“You shall take in your hand this staff.” You said: “I am not a man of words” (Exodus 4:10). “A slave will not be admonished with words” (Proverbs 29:19). What does one do to a slave? One afflicts him with a staff. So should you take the staff with which to afflict him; that is what is written: “You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you will perform the signs.”

Chapter 4

<b>“Moses went and returned to Yeter his father-in-law and he said to him: Please, let me go and return to my brethren who are in Egypt and see if they are still alive. Yitro said to Moses: Go in peace” (Exodus 4:18).</b> <br>“Moses went and returned to Yeter his father-in-law” – that is what is written: “[Who shall ascend the mountain of the Lord? Who shall stand in His holy place?] He who has clean hands and is pure of heart, [who has not taken My name in vain, nor taken an oath deceitfully]” (Psalms 24:3–4). Who is able to climb the mountain of God? One who has these attributes; and all of them were stated in Moses’s regard. <br>“Clean hands” – this is Moses, as it is stated: “I have not taken [<i>nasati</i>] one donkey from them…” (Numbers 16:15). Had he taken a donkey that was theirs, how would he be different from robbers? Rather, so said Moses: All those journeys that we traveled in the wilderness, I did not say to one of them to take an item of mine and load it on his donkey. <i>Nesia</i> is an expression of nothing other than loading, as it is stated: “Each man loaded his donkey” (Genesis 44:13)<i>.</i> <br>“Pure of heart” – this is Moses, who did not set out on the mission of the Holy One blessed be He, until he clarified his undertaking, as it is stated: “And they will say to me: What is His name, [what shall I say to them?]” (Exodus 3:13). <br>“Who has not taken My name in vain” – this is the life of the Egyptian, as he killed the Egyptian only after he judged him and saw that he was liable for execution.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This derivation is based on the unusual way in which the verse states “My name” – <i>nafshi</i>, which is from the word <i>nefesh</i>, which generally means life. Alternatively, it is based on the opinion that Moses killed the Egyptian by mentioning the name of God (See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:29). </i> <br>“Nor taken an oath deceitfully” – this is Moses. When he went to Yitro he took an oath to him that he would not leave without his knowledge. When he went on the mission of the Holy One blessed be He, he went to Yitro and nullified his oath.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He received permission from Yitro to leave, and therefore did not violate his oath (<i>Yefei Toar</i>).</i> That is what is written: “He returned to Yeter his father-in-law.”
Another interpretation: “Moses went” – that is what is written: “A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity” (Proverbs 17:17). Who is “a friend loves”? This is Yitro, who accepted Moses when he was fleeing from Pharaoh. From here you learn that one who accepts upon himself to perform a mitzva, that mitzva does not cease from his household. Yitro’s mitzva<i> </i>was that he accepted into his house a deliverer who fled from an enemy. From his house, one emerged who accepted an enemy who fled from a deliverer, and killed him. Who is that? Sisera, as it is stated: “Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Yael, wife of Ḥever the Kenite” (Judges 4:17), and it is written: “The children of the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses” (Judges 1:16). Therefore, it says: “A brother is born for adversity” – because Yitro loved Moses and was his friend, therefore his descendants became brethren to Israel in their time of trouble, and Yael killed Sisera. <br>When the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Go now, and I will send you to Pharaoh” (Exodus 3:10), he said to Him: ‘Master of the world, I am not able to do so, because Yitro accepted me and opened his house to me and I am like a son to him. One who opens his door to another, [the latter] owes him his life.’ Likewise, you find regarding Elijah when he went to the widow from Tzarefat, her son died. He began pleading and saying: “Have You brought evil even upon the widow with whom I lodge, to kill her son?”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Due to Elijah’s debt of gratitude toward the widow, he risked his life on her behalf by praying impertinently for her son’s revival. Similarly, Moses risked his life for Yitro by not undertaking God’s mission without Yitro’s permission (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> (I Kings 17:20). And it is written: “The Lord heeded the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child was restored” (I Kings 17:22). <br>Moreover, anyone who opens his door to another, [the latter] is obligated in his honor more than in the honor of his father and mother. You find that at the moment that Elijah was taken from Elisha, and [Elisha] was privileged to take a double portion of his spirit, as it is stated: “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me” (II Kings 2:9), he should have gone to his father and mother and revived them as he did the son of his hostess.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See II Kings, chap. 4.</i> Likewise, Elijah should have revived his ancestors, as he did the son of the [widow from] Tzarefat, but he risked his life [only] on behalf of his hostess. That is why Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Yitro accepted me and treated me with respect; I will go only with his permission.’ Therefore, it is written: “Moses went and returned to Yeter his father-in-law.”
Another interpretation: “Moses went” – that is what is written: “He is one; who can respond to Him” (Job 23:13). Rabbi Pinḥas expounded: Because He is one in the world, He judges all mankind alone, and no one can overturn His words <as it is written in <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba</i>, <i>Parasha </i>1>. Our Rabbis said: What is “He is one; who can respond to Him”? Whatever He issues as a decree on a person, there is no overturning His words. <br>How much did Bilam seek to curse Israel, but against his will and against his best interests he would bless them, as it is stated: “How will I curse if God has not cursed?” (Numbers 23:8). <br>How much did Jonah seek not to go on the mission of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He went down to Yafo, and found a ship going to Tarshish” (Jonah 1:3), and he went against his will, as it is stated: “Jonah arose and went to Nineveh” (Jonah 3:3). <br>How much did Jeremiah seek not to prophesy, and he prophesied against his best interests, as it is stated: “Do not say I am a lad, because to wherever I will send you, you shall go” (Jeremiah 1:7). <br>How much did Moses seek not to go on the mission of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Send, please, by means of whom You will send” (Exodus 4:13), but ultimately, he went against his will, as it is stated: “Moses went and returned to Yeter his father-in-law.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “Moses went” is not referring to his going to Yitro, as the word “went” would have been unnecessary. The verse is therefore alluding to the fact that although Moses did not go right away, ultimately it was impossible for him not to carry out his mission. </i>
Another interpretation: “Moses went” – it was necessary to say only: “Moses returned.” Rather, our Rabbis said: Initially, he went to Pharaoh on the mission of the Holy One blessed be He, and then: “He returned to Yeter his father-in-law.” This is what the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘If Yitro will say anything to you about the oath, say to him: The Master of the oath<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">God, in whose name the oath was taken (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> absolved me of my vow.’ Therefore, “Moses went,” and then: “He returned to Yeter his father-in-law.” <br>The son of Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: He did not go to Pharaoh until Yitro annulled his vow. If you say, why is it stated: “Moses went”? Where did he go? He went to take his wife and sons. Yitro said to him: ‘Where are you leading them?’ He said to him: ‘To Egypt.’ He said to him: ‘Those who are in Egypt are seeking to leave, and you are leading them there?’ He said to him: ‘Tomorrow they are destined to leave and to stand at Mount Sinai and hear from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He: “I am the Lord, Your God” (Exodus 20:2). Will my sons not hear it like them?’ Immediately, “Yitro said to Moses: Go in peace.” He said to him: ‘Go in peace, enter in peace, and come in peace.’

Chapter 5

<b>“The Lord said to Aaron: Go toward Moses to the wilderness. He went, and he met him at the mountain of God and he kissed him” (Exodus 4:27).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Aaron: Go toward Moses to the wilderness” – that is what is written: “If only you were as my brother [who nursed from the breasts of my mother; I would find you outside, I would kiss you]” (Song of Songs 8:1). Regarding which brother is the verse speaking? If you say it is regarding Cain, but is it not written: “Cain rose against his brother Abel and killed him”? If you say it is like Ishmael to Isaac, did we not learn: Ishmael hates Isaac? If you say it is like Esau to Jacob, is it not written: “Esau hated Jacob” (Genesis 27:41)? If you say it is like Joseph’s brothers, but is it not written: “They hated him” (Genesis 37:4), and it is written: “His brothers envied him” (Genesis 37:11). Rather, it is like Joseph to Benjamin, “who nursed from the breasts of my mother” (Song of Songs 8:1),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph and Benjamin were from the same mother, Rachel, whereas their other brothers were not sons of Rachel. </i> [and] like Moses to Aaron, as it is stated: “He went, and he met him at the mountain of God and he kissed him.” <br>Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: All kisses are indecent except for three: The kiss of greatness, the kiss of separation, and the kiss of reunion. The kiss of greatness, as it is stated: “Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him” (I Samuel 10:1); the kiss of separation: “Orpa kissed her mother-in-law” (Ruth 1:14); the kiss of reunion, as it is stated: “He went, and he met him at the mountain of God and he kissed him.” <br>Some say: Even a kiss of closeness is not disgraceful, as it is stated: “Jacob kissed Rachel” (Genesis 29:11), who was his relative. Rabbi Pinḥas said: There was an incident involving a brother and a sister, one of whom was in Gush Ḥalav and one of whom was in Beit Maron. The house in Gush Ḥalav caught fire. His sister came from Beit Maron and fell upon him and was hugging him and kissing him. She said: ‘I am not accustomed to come to you [and to kiss you], but I was afraid, as you are my brother and were in distress, and you emerged from it.’ <br>“I would find you outside, I would kiss you” (Song of Songs 8:1) – where outside? It is in the wilderness, where the brothers, Moses and Aaron, kissed each other.
Rabbi Ḥama said: At twelve years old, Moses our master was torn from his father’s house. Why was it so? It is because had he grown in his father’s home, and come and related these signs to Israel, they would not have believed him. They would have said: Your father passed it to you; as Joseph passed it to Levi, and Levi to Kehat, and Kehat to Amram.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>midrash</i> (<i>Shemot Rabba</i> 3:8, 5:13) states that when Moses said, in the name of God, “I have remembered [<i>pakod pakadti</i>] you” (Exodus 3:16), the elders believed him because there was an oral tradition that the redeemer of Israel would say those words when he revealed himself.</i> That is why he was torn from his father’s home. Therefore, when he went and told Israel all these matters, they believed him, as it is stated: “The people believed” (Exodus 4:31).

<b>“The Lord said to Moses in Midyan: Go, return to Egypt; as all the men who sought your life are dead” (Exodus 4:19). </b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses in Midyan: Go, return to Egypt.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Torah teaches you proper behavior. One who takes an oath to another should annul it only in his presence, so that he will not suspect him that he took a false oath, as you find that Moses took an oath to Yitro and went to Midyan and annulled his oath in his presence, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses in Midyan.” The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘In Midyan you took the oath; go and annul your oath in Midyan.’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is interpreting the verse differently than it is generally translated, as follows: God said to Moses (at the burning bush): Go to Midyan and return to Egypt (Etz Yosef). </i> <br>“As all the men…are dead” – did they die? But were they not Datan and Aviram, and they were with Koraḥ in his dispute?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 16:1.

<b>“Moses took his wife and his sons, and mounted them on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. Moses took the staff of God in his hand” (Exodus 4:20). </b> <br>“Moses took his wife and his sons” – why did he lead them there?

<b>“The Lord said to Moses: When you go back to Egypt, see all the wonders that I have placed in your hand and perform them before Pharaoh; but I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go” (Exodus 4:21).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: When you go…” Of which wonder did He speak? If you say it is regarding the serpent, the leprosy, and the blood; didn’t the Holy One blessed be He say to him to perform them only for Israel? Moreover, we do not find that Moses performed those signs before Pharaoh. Rather, what is “all the wonders that I have placed in your hand”? This is the staff upon which all ten plagues were written in acronym form, as <i>detzakh adash be’aḥav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is an acronym of the initials of the plagues: Blood [dam], frogs [tzefarde’a], lice [kinnim] – detzakh; wild beasts [arov], pestilence [dever], boils [shekhin] – adash; hail [barad], locusts [arbeh], darkness [ḥoshekh], firstborn [bekhorot] – be’aḥav.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: These are the plagues that I have placed in your hand.

<b>“It was on the way at the lodging, the Lord met him, and sought to kill him” (Exodus 4:24).</b> <br>“It was on the way at the lodging” – circumcision is dear, as Moses’s punishment for [not performing] it was not delayed for even one moment. Therefore, when he was on the way and was preparing the lodging and was indolent in circumcising his son Elazar, immediately, “the Lord met him, and sought to kill him.” You find that it was an angel of mercy,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">“The Lord” is the name that represents the attribute of mercy.</i> and, nevertheless, “He sought to kill him.” <br><b>Tzipora took flint, cut her son’s foreskin, and cast it at his feet; she said: You are to me a bridegroom of blood” (Exodus 4:25). </b> <br>“Tzipora took flint” – how did Tzipora know that it was over matters of circumcision that Moses was endangered? Rather, the angel came and swallowed Moses from his head to the [place of] circumcision. When Tzipora saw that he swallowed him only until the circumcision, she understood that he was being harmed due to matters of circumcision. She realized just how great the power of circumcision is, as he was unable to swallow him beyond there. Immediately, “she cut her son’s foreskin, and cast it at his feet.” <br>“She said: You are to me a bridegroom of blood” – she said: ‘My bridegroom, may you be given to me thanks to this blood of circumcision, as I fulfilled the mitzva.’ Immediately, “he let him alone” (4:26). <br><b>“He let him alone. Then she said: A bridegroom of blood regarding the circumcision” (Exodus 4:26).</b> <br>“Then she said: A bridegroom of blood regarding the circumcision” – she said: How great the power of circumcision is, as my bridegroom was liable to be executed because he was indolent in performance of the mitzva of circumcision, and were it not for it, he would not have been saved.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Once he was liable to be killed, it was only the performance of circumcision that caused him to be saved. </i>
<b>“The Lord said to Aaron: Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. He went, and he met him at the mountain of God and he kissed him” (Exodus 4:27).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Aaron: Go into the wilderness to meet Moses” – that is what is written: “God thunders marvelously with His voice” (Job 37:5). What is “thunders”? When the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah at Sinai, He displayed His voice to Israel with miracles and wonders. How so? The Holy One blessed be He would speak, and the voice emerged and circulated throughout the world. Israel heard the voice coming to them from the south and were running to the south to greet the voice. From the south it shifted for them to the north, and they were running to the north. From the north it shifted to the east, and they were running to the east. From the east it shifted for them to the west, and they were running to the west. From the west it shifted for them to the heavens, and they were raising their eyes. It shifted to the earth, and they were looking at the earth, as it is stated: “From the heavens, He sounded His voice to you to admonish you [and on the earth He showed you His great fire]” (Deuteronomy 4:36). <br>Israel were saying to each other: “But wisdom, where shall it be found?” (Job 28:12). Israel was saying: ‘From where does the Holy One blessed be He come, from the east or from the south?’ As it is stated: “The Lord came from Sinai and shone to them from Seir” (Deuteronomy 33:2), and it is written: “God came from the south” (Habakkuk 3:3), and it says: “All the people were seeing the voices” (Exodus 20:15). Voice is not written here, but “voices.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The voice would emerge and divide into seventy voices for seventy languages, so that all the nations could understand. Each and every nation would hear a voice in the language of that nation, and their souls departed. But Israel heard and they were not harmed. <br>How would the voice emerge? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: It would emerge in two forms: It would kill the idolaters, who did not accept it, and would give life to Israel, who accepted the Torah. That is what Moses said to them at the end of forty years: “For who is there of all flesh who heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire [as we have, and lived?]” (Deuteronomy 5:22). You heard His voice and lived, but idolaters heard and died. Come and see how the voice would emerge to each one of Israel, each and every one in accordance with his capability; the elderly according to their capability, the young men according to their capability, the children according to their capability, the nursing babies according to their capability, the women according to their capability, and Moses, too, according to his capability, as it is stated: “Moses would speak, and God would answer him with a voice” (Exodus 19:19), with a voice that he could withstand. Likewise it says: “The voice of the Lord is powerful [<i>bako’aḥ</i>]” (Psalms 29:4). It does not say His capability, <i>bekoḥo</i>, but rather <i>bako’aḥ</i>, according to the capability of each and every one, and even pregnant women according to their capability. That is: Each and every one according to his capability. <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: If you are astonished about this matter, learn from the manna that would fall for Israel only according to the capability of each and every one of Israel. The young men would eat it as bread, as it is stated: “Behold I will rain bread for you from the heavens…” (Exodus 16:4); the elderly, like honey wafers, as it is stated: “And its taste was like wafers with honey” (Exodus 16:31); the nursing babies, like milk from his mother’s breasts [<i>shedei</i>], as it is stated: “Its taste was like the taste of a cake [<i>leshad</i>] with oil” (Numbers 11:8); and the ill, like fine flour mixed with honey, as it is stated: “My bread that I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I fed you” (Ezekiel 16:19); the idolaters tasted it bitter like a coriander seed, as it is stated: “The manna was like a coriander seed” (Numbers 11:7). <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: If the manna, which was one type, transformed into several types to fill the need of each and every one, the voice that had power in it,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The voice of God, in accordance with the verse cited above: “The voice of the Lord is powerful” (Psalms 29:4). </i> all the more so that it would change for each and every one so they would not be harmed. From where is it derived that the voice divided into several voices so they would not be harmed? It is as it is stated: “All the people were seeing the voices” (Exodus 20:15). That is: “God thunders marvelously with His voice” (Job 37:5). <br>Another interpretation: “God thunders marvelously with His voice” – Rabbi Levi said: Three sounds carry from one end of the world to the other, and creatures are between them and do not hear anything, and these are they: The day, the rains, and the soul at the moment that it leaves the body. <br>The day, from where is it derived? Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Ilai said: This is the star that moves stealthily in the heavens, but is actually like a saw [variant reading, like a nail] that cuts into wood. <br>The rains, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Depth calls to depth at the sound of your watercourses” (Psalms 42:8). How so? There is a tree whose roots descend twenty cubits, another [whose roots descend] thirty [cubits], another fifty, and some descend only three handbreadths. If the rains from above irrigate [to a depth of] only three handbreadths, those [whose roots descend] fifty cubits will die. If those of fifty cubits are irrigated, it will destroy those of three handbreadths. Rather, the upper depth<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In the heavens</i> calls to the lower depth<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Under the earth</i> and says to it: ‘Ascend, and I will descend.’ And the lower says to it: ‘Descend and I will ascend.’ The upper descends and irrigates those of three handbreadths, and the lower ascends and irrigates those of fifty cubits. Come and see how far it is between these and those and they call to each other, and people are in the middle but do not hear. That is: “God thunders marvelously with His voice.” <br>The soul, at the moment that it leaves the body [also makes a very loud sound], and the people sitting with him do not hear. That is: “God thunders marvelously with His voice.” <br>Rabbi Reuven said: When the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses in Midyan: “Go, return to Egypt” (Exodus 4:19), the speech was divided into two voices and assumed two forms. Moses heard in Midyan: “Go, return to Egypt,” and Aaron heard: “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses” (Exodus 4:27). That is: “God thunders marvelously with His voice.”
“He went, and he met him [at the mountain of God and he kissed him]” – that is what is written: “Kindness and truth met, righteousness and peace kissed” (Psalms 85:11). “Kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>]” – this is Aaron, as it is stated: “Of Levi he said: Your Tummim and your Urim for the man of your piety [<i>ḥasidekha</i>]” (Deuteronomy 33:8). “And truth” – this is Moses, as it is stated: “My servant Moses is not so, [in all My house he is trusted]” (Numbers 12:7). That is: “Kindness and truth met,” as it is stated: “He went, and he met him at the mountain of God.” “Righteousness” – this is Moses, as it is stated: “He executed the righteousness of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 33:21). “And peace” – this is Aaron, as it is stated: “He walked with Me in peace and uprightness” (Malachi 2:6). “Kissed” – “and he kissed him.” <br>Our Rabbis say: All kisses are indecent except for three <as cited above>. <br>“He kissed him” – what is “he kissed him”? This one was glad for the prominence of that one, and that one was glad for the prominence of this one. Alternatively, “he kissed [<i>vayishak</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is an expression of economy [<i>meshek</i>], indicating a transaction. </i> him” – they took the priestly and Levite status; this one took the priestly status and transferred the Levite status, and that one took the Levite status and transferred the priestly status. <br>Another interpretation: “He kissed him” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is comparable to a goldsmith to whom they brought a coin and he saw that inside it was earthenware and outside it was gold. Later, they brought him a coin that was solid gold. He said to them: The first was earthenware and was plated with gold, but this is solid gold. Similarly, the kiss that Esau kissed Jacob was only dross, as it is stated: “An earthen vessel plated with silver dross” (Proverbs 26:23). What was its end? “Burning lips and a wicked heart” (Proverbs 26:23) – he did not seek to kiss him, but rather to bite him. But the kiss of Aaron and Moses was a kiss of truth. In their regard it says: “Kindness and truth met.” <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon says: “Kindness” – this is Aaron; “and truth” – this is Moses. Rabbi Azarya says: “Kindness” – this is Moses, who performed kindness with Joseph. “Truth” – this is Aaron, as it is written: “The law of truth was in his mouth” (Malachi 2:6). That is: “Kindness and truth met” – this is Moses and Aaron. <br>“He kissed him” – we do not know to whom the Holy One blessed be He accorded deference, whether it was to Aaron or to Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, who was the one who was kissed. </i> Some say that it was to Aaron, who was in Egypt and prophesying to Israel that the Holy One blessed be He is destined to deliver them. [Moses accorded him honor] so that [when] Moses would come and testify in support of Aaron’s words, Israel would say: Aaron was prophesying the truth. Some say that it was to Moses, [and Aaron accorded him honor] so that Moses would come and they would believe his words.
<b>“Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord that He had sent him, and all the signs that He had charged him” (Exodus 4:28).</b> <br>“Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord…” – Moses began saying to him all the words and all the signs that He commanded him to perform before the people. Just as the Holy One blessed be He said to him, so he did: “You shall speak to him, and place the words in his mouth” (Exodus 4:15).
<b>“Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel” (Exodus 4:29).</b> <br>“Moses and Aaron went and gathered…” – Rabbi Akiva said: Why was Israel analogized to the bird? Just as a bird flies only by virtue of its wings, so too, Israel is able to stand only by virtue of the elders [<i>zekenim</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zaken </i>is an acronym for <i>zeh shekana ḥokhma</i>, one who acquired wisdom.

It is not written: Of the elders of His people, but rather “with the elders of His people.” He will be sitting with them, and they will judge the idolaters. What does He say to [the idolaters]? “You have consumed the vineyard” (Isaiah 3:14) – this is Israel, as it is written: “For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel” (Isaiah 5:7). “The theft of the poor [<i>he’ani</i>] is in your houses” (Isaiah 3:14) – and it is written: “For the Lord had founded Zion, and in it the afflicted [<i>aniyei</i>] of His people will take refuge” (Isaiah 14:32).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This proves that the term <i>ani</i> in Isaiah 3:14 is referring to the Jewish people. </i> <br>Likewise, it was the way of the kings to sit in the shape of a round threshing floor, as it is stated: “The king of Israel and Yehoshafat king of Judah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they sat in a threshing floor” (II Chronicles 18:9).

<b>“Aaron spoke all the words that the Lord had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs before the eyes of the people” (Exodus 4:30).</b> <br>“Aaron spoke all the words” – he acted in accordance with what the Holy One blessed be He had said: “He will speak for you to the people” (Exodus 4:16). “And performed the signs before the eyes of the people” – as [God] had said [to him] above.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Exodus 4:17</i> <br><b>“The people believed; they heard that the Lord had remembered the children of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, and they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves” (Exodus 4:31).</b> <br>“The people believed” – they acted in accordance with what the Holy One blessed be He had said: “They will heed your voice” (Exodus 3:18). Could it be that they did not believe until they saw the signs? No, rather, “they heard that the Lord had remembered”; they believed because of what they heard, and not the seeing of the signs. What led them to believe? It was the sign of the remembrance that he said to them, as they had a tradition from Jacob that Jacob passed the secret to Joseph, and Joseph to his brothers, and Asher son of Jacob passed the secret to his daughter Seraḥ, who was still alive. This is what he said to her: Any deliverer who will come and say to my descendants: “<i>Pakod pakadti etkhem</i>,” he is a genuine deliverer. When Moses came and said: “I have remembered you [<i>pakod pakadti</i> <i>etkhem</i>]” (Exodus 3:16), immediately, “the people believed.” What led them to believe? It was because they heard the remembrance. That is what is written: “That the Lord had remembered [<i>pakad</i>] the children of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, and they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.” “They bowed” – for the remembrance, “and they prostrated themselves” – for “that He had seen their affliction.”
<b>“Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh: So said the Lord, God of Israel: Let My people go, and they will hold a feast to Me in the wilderness” (Exodus 5:1).</b> <br>“Afterward Moses and Aaron came” – where did the elders go, that they were not included with them, as the Holy One blessed be He already said to him: “And you shall come, you and the elders of Israel” (Exodus 3:18)? Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: The elders accompanied them, but secretively stole away one at a time or two at a time and left. When they reached Pharaoh’s palace not one could be found, as it is written: “Afterward Moses and Aaron came.” Where were the elders? They had left. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: This is what you did; by your lives, I will pay you back. When? At the time that Moses and Aaron ascended Mount Sinai with the elders to receive the Torah, the Holy One blessed be He turned them back, as it is stated: “To the elders he said: Wait here for us” (Exodus 24:14). <br>“And said to Pharaoh: So said the Lord, God of Israel: Let My people go, and they will hold a feast to Me in the wilderness” – Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: That day was the day of Pharaoh’s reception of ambassadors, and all the rulers came to honor him and brought gifts of crowns, and they crowned him, as it was the day that he was ruler of the world. They brought their gods with them. After they crowned him, Moses and Aaron were standing at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace. His servants entered and said: Two elderly people are standing at the entrance. He said to them: Let them enter. When they entered, he was looking at them; perhaps they would crown him or perhaps they would submit a writ [of submission or appeasement], but they did not even greet him. <br>He said to them: ‘Who are you?’ They said to him: ‘We are the emissaries of the Holy One blessed be He.’ ‘What do you seek?’ They said to him: “So said the Lord [God of Israel]: Let My people go…” At that moment, he became angry: ‘“Who is the Lord that I should heed His voice to let Israel go?” (Exodus 5:2). He did not have the sense to send me a crown, but you come to me with mere words? “I do not know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go”’ (Exodus 5:2). <br>He said to them: ‘Wait for me until I search my ledger.’ Immediately, he entered his palace and was looking at each and every nation and its gods. He began reading about the gods of Moav, the gods of Amon, and the gods of Sidon. He said to them: ‘I searched for His name in my archives and I did not find Him.’ Rabbi Levi said: To what is this matter analogous? To a priest with a servant who was an imbecile. The priest left the country. The servant went to search for his master in the graveyard. He began shouting to the people who were standing there: ‘Have you seen my master?’ They said to him: ‘Is your master not a priest?’ He said to them: ‘Yes.’ They said to him: ‘Imbecile, who ever saw a priest in a graveyard?’ So Moses and Aaron said to Pharaoh: ‘Imbecile, does one typically seek the dead among the living? Are the living with the dead? Our God is living and these that you mention are dead. But our God is the living God and King of the world. <br>He said to them: ‘Is He young or old? How old is He? How many cities has He conquered? How many countries has He captured? How many years have passed since He became king?’ They said to him: ‘Our God, His power and His might fill the world. He was before the world was created and He will be at the end of the entire world. He created you and placed in you a living spirit.’ He said to them: ‘What are His actions?’ They said to him: ‘“He stretched the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth” (Isaiah 51:13), His voice “hews flames of fire” (Psalms 29:7), He “smashes mountains and shatters rocks” (I Kings 19:11), His bow is fire, his arrows are a flame, His javelin is a torch, His shield is clouds, His sword is lightning, He forms mountains and hills, He blankets mountains with vegetation, He causes rain and dew to fall, He causes grasses to grow, He answers mothers in childbirth, He shapes the fetus in his mother’s womb, He takes it out to the atmosphere of the world, and “He removes kings and installs kings”’ (Daniel 2:21). <br>He said to them: ‘From the outset, you are telling a lie, as I am the lord of the world, and I created myself and the Nile,’ as it is stated: “My river is mine, and I made myself” (Ezekiel 29:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Ezekiel attributes this verse to Pharaoh. </i> At that moment, he assembled all the wise men of Egypt.

See what is written there: “The princes of Tzoan are utter fools” (Isaiah 19:11); “The wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their understanding men will be hidden”’ (Isaiah 29:14). <br>He responded to them: ‘Your God, I do not know who He is,’ as it is stated: “Who is the Lord that I should heed His voice?” (Exodus 5:2).

With how many were they afflicted with the finger: Ten plagues. Calculate: There are five fingers on the great hand, and on each and every one ten plagues; that is fifty. <br>Another interpretation: “Who [<i>mi</i>] is the Lord” – reverse the order of <i>mi</i> [and the result is] <i>yam</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mi</i> is spelled <i>mem-yod</i>; <i>yam</i> is spelled <i>yod-mem</i>. </i> it is the sea that informed you of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As it is stated at the sea: “Egypt said: I will flee before Israel, as the Lord is waging war on their behalf against Egypt” (Exodus 14:25).</i> You said: “Who is the Lord”; you are destined to say: “The Lord is righteous” (Exodus 9:27).

<b>“They said: The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go, please, three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest He afflict us with pestilence or with the sword” (Exodus 5:3).</b> <br>“They said: The God of the Hebrews has met with us” – Moses and Aaron said: If you say that we changed the language from the one which the Holy One blessed be He said to us, and we said to him: “So said the Lord, God of Israel,” and that is why [Pharaoh] questioned us; [therefore,] they then said: “The God of the Hebrews.” <br>“Lest he afflict us with pestilence or with the sword” – it should have said rather: Lest He afflict you. What is “lest he afflict us”? It is to teach you that they treated him with deference, to teach you that a person is obligated to accord deference to royalty.
<b>“The king of Egypt said to them: Why, Moses and Aaron, do you disturb the people from their work?

Moses and Aaron had already explained why they were disturbing the people from their work. The midrash interprets the word <i>lama</i> as <i>lema</i>.

Pharaoh said to them: ‘Because you are unencumbered you say: “Let us go and sacrifice to our God” (Exodus 5:8); “go to your burdens.”’
<b>“Pharaoh said: Behold, the people of the land are now many; and will you cause them to cease from their burdens?” (Exodus 5:5).</b> <br>“Pharaoh said: Behold, the people of the land are now many” – he said to them: ‘If it were one thousand people that you seek or two thousand, I would allow it.

<b>“That day, Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their foremen, saying” (Exodus 5:6).</b> <br>“That day, Pharaoh commanded” – it teaches about this wicked one that he did not delay harming them. This was the fourth decree.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:12.</i> <br>“The taskmasters pressed, saying” (Exodus 5:13) – these are the Egyptians; the foremen – these are the elders of Israel. <br><b>“You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as previously; they will go and gather straw for themselves.

Let heavier work be imposed upon the men, and they will labor in it; and let them not regard false words.” (Exodus 5:7–9)</b> <br>“You shall no longer give the people straw.… and the quota of the bricks” – from here you learn that each and every one had a quota of how many bricks they were to make daily. Therefore, initially, he enslaved them with gentle persuasion so that they would make the bricks with all their might, and to see the extent of their ability. On the basis of the number that they made the first day, they decreed upon them to make every day. <br>“For they are lazy [<i>nirpim</i>]” – Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: He began clenching his teeth and saying: You are <i>nirpim</i>, which is an expression of filth.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Had the reference been to indolence, it should have said <i>mitrapim</i>.</i> May his bones be crushed, as they [Israel] are sacred. <br>“Therefore they cry, saying.… Let heavier work be imposed upon the men” – this teaches that they had scrolls in their possession in which they would delight every Shabbat, that said that the Holy One blessed be He will deliver them. Because they rested on Shabbat, Pharaoh said to them: ‘“Let heavier work be imposed upon the men, and they will labor in it; and let them not regard [<i>yishu</i>]…” – let them not delight [<i>mishtaashin</i>], and let them not rest on the Shabbat day.’
<b>“The taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out, and they spoke to the people, saying: So said Pharaoh: I will not give you straw” (Exodus 5:10).</b> <br>“The taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out” – when he issued that decree, Moses went to Midyan and spent six months there, while Aaron resided in Egypt. It was then that Moses returned his wife and sons to Midyan. <br><b>“You go and get yourselves straw where you can find it, as nothing will be diminished from your work. The people scattered throughout the entire land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw” (Exodus 5:11–12).</b> <br>“You go and get yourselves straw.… The people scattered throughout the entire land of Egypt” – it was because Moses was in Midyan.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites and the cities they were building, Pitom and Raamses, were in Goshen. Why then did they scatter throughout the land? It was to search for Moses.</i> <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Tomorrow I will bring plagues upon them, and they will say: Pharaoh is sinning and we are suffering?’ When Israel was going to bring straw for production, the Egyptian would see him in his field and would break his shins; therefore, “the people scattered.”<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This was so the Egyptians would also be deserving of punishment.</i> <br><b>“The taskmasters pressed, saying: Complete your work, each day’s matter on its day, as when there was straw” (Exodus 5:13).</b> <br>“The taskmasters pressed, saying” – these were the wicked Egyptians who were pressing them and saying to them: “Complete your work.” But the foremen were not pressing them, as they were upright, and they would see them in great distress and would not press them.
<b>“The foremen of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, saying: Why have you not fulfilled your appointed task in making bricks both yesterday and today as previously?” (Exodus 5:14).</b> <br>“The foremen of the children of Israel…were beaten” – from here you learn that they were upright, they dedicated themselves on behalf of Israel, and they suffered beatings to ease their situation. Therefore, they merited the divine spirit, as it is stated: “Gather to Me seventy men from the elders of Israel [whom you know to be elders of the people and their foremen]” (Numbers 11:16). The Holy One blessed be He said: They were beaten on their behalf; therefore, they will merit the divine spirit. They were appointed prophets over them. <br><b>“The foremen of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying: Why do you deal so with your servants. Straw is not given to your servants, and bricks they say to us: Make; and, behold, your servants are beaten, but the fault is in your own people.… The foremen of the children of Israel saw them in distress, when they said: Do not diminish from your bricks, each day’s matter on its day. They met Moses and Aaron, standing in their way, as they emerged from before Pharaoh” (Exodus 5:15–20).</b> <br>“The foremen of the children of Israel came and cried.… Straw is not given to your servants.… The foremen of the children of Israel saw them in distress, when they said.… they met Moses and Aaron, standing” – six months later, the Holy One blessed be He appeared to Moses in Midyan and said to him: “Go, return to Egypt” (Exodus 4:19). Moses came from Midyan and Aaron from Egypt, and they encountered the foremen of Israel as they were emerging from before Pharaoh. What is “standing [<i>nitzavim</i>]”? Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, say: Datan and Aviram were with them, as it is written in their regard: “Datan and Aviram emerged standing [<i>nitzavim</i>]” (Numbers 16:27); they began cursing and blaspheming vis-à-vis Moses and Aaron.
<b>“They said to them: May the Lord look upon you, and judge; as you have made our scent abhorrent in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to place a sword in their hand to kill us” (Exodus 5:21).</b> <br>“May the Lord look upon you, and judge” – if you have truly come in the name of the Holy One blessed be He, may He judge between us and Pharaoh. But if you came at your own initiative, may the Lord judge between us and you. <br>“As you have made our scent abhorrent” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From the beatings that they would beat them, their scent was abhorrent. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Those whom they would place in the building would die, and their scent was abhorrent.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">When the Israelites did not fill their quotas of bricks, the Egyptians would take Israelite children and insert them into the buildings instead of bricks (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 2:5). </i> Rabbi Ḥiyya said: This is analogous to a carcass that was placed in a corner and was covered with dirt, and its scent was not sensed. When someone came and uncovered it, its scent was sensed. So, they said to Moses: ‘Moses, there was a sense [lit. scent] among the Egyptians that we are destined to be delivered, and you came and exacerbated it.’ <br>“To place a sword in their hand to kill us” – Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi son of Rabbi Shalom said: They said to Moses: ‘To what are we comparable? To a lamb that a wolf came to take it; the shepherd ran after it to rescue it from the mouth of the wolf. Between the shepherd and the wolf, the lamb is torn to pieces.’ So said Israel: ‘Moses, between you and Pharaoh we will die.’
<b>“Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why have You harmed this people, why is it that You sent me?” (Exodus 5:22).</b> <br>“Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why have You harmed this people?” – at that moment, Moses came and argued before the Holy One blessed be He. He said to Him: “Why have You harmed…” – what is: “Lord, why have You harmed”? According to the way of the world, when a flesh-and-blood person says to another: ‘Why are you doing so,’ [the latter] gets angry at him, yet Moses said to the Holy One blessed be He: “Why have You harmed this people”? Rather, this is what he said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘I have taken the book of Genesis and read it. I saw the actions of the generation of the flood, and how they were judged; it was the attribute of justice. And the actions of the generation of the dispersion and of the Sodomites, and how they were judged; it was the attribute of justice. This people, what have they done that they were enslaved more than all past generations? If it is because our patriarch Abraham said: “How will I know that I will inherit it” (Genesis 15:8), and You said to him: “Know that your descendants will be strangers [in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years]” (Genesis 15:13), Esau and Ishmael are his descendants and they should have been enslaved like them. Even if so, He should have enslaved the generation of Isaac of the generation of Jacob, and not this people in my generation. And if You say why do I care – if so, why is it that You sent me?’ <br><b>“Since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has harmed this people; and You did not rescue Your people” (Exodus 5:23).</b> <br>“Since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has harmed…” – Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen ben Ḥama said: He said before Him: ‘Your great name is mighty and awesome, and the entire world fears it. The wicked Pharaoh has heard Your name and sinned willfully.’ What is “You did not rescue”?<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In the Hebrew this is formulated with a double usage of the term rescue – <i>vehatzel lo hitzalta</i>. </i> Rabbi Yishmael says: You will certainly not rescue them. Rabbi Akiva says: I know that You are destined to rescue them, but You do not care about those who are under the building. At that moment, the attribute of justice sought to harm Moses, but since the Holy One blessed be He saw that he was speaking on behalf of Israel, the attribute of justice did not harm him.
<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them from his land” (Exodus 6:1).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh” – the wars with Pharaoh you will see, but you will not see the wars with the thirty-one kings [of Canaan], against whom Joshua your disciple will take revenge. From here you learn that it was now that Moses was sentenced that he would not enter the Land [of Israel]. <br>

Chapter 6

<b>“God spoke to Moses and said to him: I am the Lord. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name the Lord I did not make Myself known to them” (Exodus 6:2–3).</b> <br>“God spoke to Moses and said to him: I am the Lord. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac...” That is what is written: “I turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly; for who is the man who comes after the king to do what he already has done?” (Ecclesiastes 2:12). This verse is referring to Solomon and to Moses. How to Solomon? When the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah to Israel, he gave positive mitzvot and prohibitions, and gave the king a few mitzvot, as it is stated: “Only he shall not accumulate horses for himself…and he shall not accumulate wives for himself, and his heart will not stray, and silver and gold he shall not greatly accumulate for himself” (Deuteronomy 17:16–17). Solomon rose and thought to outsmart the decree of the Holy One blessed be He. “He shall not accumulate [<i>yarbe</i>] wives for himself,” isn’t that so “his heart will not stray?” I will accumulate and my heart will not stray. At that moment, the <i>yod</i> that is in <i>yarbe</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The letter <i>yod</i> in this form indicates the future tense. Solomon was confident that he would not stray, and thus thought the future “so that his heart will not stray” did not apply to him.</i> went up and prostrated itself before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, didn’t You say that there will never be a letter negated from the Torah? Behold, Solomon is revoking me. Perhaps today he will negate one and tomorrow another, until the entire Torah is negated.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to it: ‘Solomon and one thousand like him will be negated, and not one calligraphical embellishment will I negate.’ From where He negated it [the letter <i>yod</i>] from the Torah, and it returned to the Torah? It is as it is stated: “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her by the name Sarai, as Sarah<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Sarai is spelled <i>sin, resh, yod</i>. God replaced the letter <i>yod </i>at the end of her name with the letter <i>heh</i>, rendering it Sarah.</i> is her name” (Genesis 17:15). Where did it [the letter <i>yod</i>] return? “Moses called Hoshea bin Nun, Joshua” (Numbers 13:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The change from Hoshea to Joshua is made with the addition of the letter <i>yod </i>at the beginning of the name, so that it is spelled <i>yod, heh, vav, shin, ayin.</i></i> <br>Solomon, who considered negating a letter from the Torah, what is written about him? “The words of Agur ben Yakeh”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The book of Proverbs is attributed to Solomon.</i> (Proverbs 30:1) – who collected [<i>iger</i>] matters of Torah and expelled them [<i>hekian</i>]. “The utterance of the man to Itiel” (Proverbs 30:1), this matter that the Holy One blessed be He said: “He shall not accumulate wives,” He said only so “his heart will not stray.” “To Itiel” – who said: God is with me [<i>iti El</i>] and I will prevail.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">My numerous wives will not cause my heart to stray.</i> What is written about him? “It was when Solomon grew old, his wives led his heart astray” (I Kings 11:4). <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: It would have been preferable for Solomon to have been a sewer cleaner than to have this verse written about him. That is why Solomon said about himself: “I turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly” (Ecclesiastes 2:12). Solomon said: ‘That which I [thought that I] have grown wise in matters of the Torah, and have shown myself that I know the wisdom of the Torah; that understanding and that knowledge were actually of madness and folly. Why? “For who is the man who comes after the king to do what he already has done?” (Ibid.). Who is it who has license to question the ways and the decrees of the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He? Matters are shaped before Him; for everything that emerges from before Him, He has already consulted with the heavenly entourage, and has informed them of the matter, so that they all will know and attest that His ruling is a ruling of truth and His decrees are truth and everything of His is done wisely. Thus it says: “Every word of God is refined” (Proverbs 30:5); and it says: “This matter is by the decree of the watchers, [and the sentence by the word of the holy ones; to the extent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whoever He will, and raises over it the lowest of men]”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The heavenly entourage (the watchers and the holy ones) are informed by God of His decrees concerning the kingdom of men.</i> (Daniel 4:14). Because I questioned His actions, I failed.’ <br>How is it [the verse in Ecclesiastes 2:12] stated about Moses? The Holy One blessed be He had already informed Moses that Pharaoh would not allow them to go, as it is stated: “I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go” (Exodus 3:19), “and I will harden his heart” (Exodus 4:21). Moses did not keep this matter in mind, and thought to outsmart the decree of the Holy One blessed be He, and began saying: “Why have You harmed this people?” (Exodus 5:22); he began arguing before Him <as cited above>. About this it is stated that this wisdom and knowledge of Moses was of madness and folly, “For who is the man who comes after the king,” – how could he question the ways of the Holy One blessed be He “to do what he already has done?” – after He had already revealed to him that He is destined to harden his [Pharaoh’s] heart in order to punish him for his enslaving them with hard labor? For this thing, the attribute of justice sought to harm Moses. That is what is written: “God [<i>Elohim</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elohim </i>is the divine name that represents the attribute of justice.</i> spoke to Moses” (Exodus 6:2). Because the Holy One blessed be He observed that it was due to the suffering of Israel that he spoke in that manner, He reconsidered and treated him with the attribute of mercy. That is what is written: “He said to him: I am the Lord [Y-H-V-H] (Exodus 6:2).”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Y-H-V-H, </i>pronounced <i>Adonai, </i>is the divine name that represents the attribute of mercy.</i>
Another explanation: “God spoke to Moses” – that is what is written: “For oppression will turn a wise man into a fool, and a gift destroys understanding” (Ecclesiastes 7:7). When a wise man engages in many matters, they confuse him, [hindering him] from wisdom, and “a gift destroys understanding” – from the Torah that was given as a gift in the heart of man. Alternatively, “for oppression will turn a wise man into a fool” – one who occupies himself with the needs of the community forgets his learning. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Rabbi Yehuda ben Pedaya taught me sixty <i>halakhot</i> about a plowed over grave and all of them have been forgotten by me because I occupied myself with the needs of the community. <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: “For oppression will turn a wise man into a fool” – that is Moses. The oppression that Datan and Aviram oppressed him, “will turn a wise man into a fool,” confused him. “A gift [<i>matana</i>] destroys understanding” – can you entertain the thought that Moses would deliberately lose his wisdom? Rather, they provoked him and said to him: “May the Lord look upon you, and judge” (Exodus 5:21). He, too, became angry and said: “Since I came to Pharaoh [to speak in Your name, he has harmed this people, and You did not deliver Your people]” (Exodus 5:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was impertinent to God due to the instigation of Datan and Aviram, who are here identified as the speakers in Exodus 5:21.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I had it written about you that you are humble,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to Numbers 12:3: “The man Moses was very humble, more that any person on the earth.”</i> and you become angry and question My words; by your life, you should know, as it is stated: “The end of a matter is better than its beginning”<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The verse concludes with praise of patience and the following verse counsels one to not be hasty in losing one’s temper. </i> (Ecclesiastes 7:8). The ultimate fate of Israel is better that the beginning that I gave them in Egypt, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: Now you will see”’ (Exodus 6:1). At that moment, the attribute of justice sought to harm him, as it is stated: “God [<i>Elohim</i>] spoke to Moses.” The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Am I flesh and blood in My attributes that I do not show mercy? That is what is written: I am the Lord [Y-H-V-H].”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See notes in the previous paragraph about the names of God representing the attributes of justice and mercy. </i> Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: “God [<i>Elohim</i>]” vis-à-vis the Egyptians, “the Lord [Y-H-V-H]” vis-à-vis Israel.
Another interpretation: “God spoke to Moses” – Rabbi Meir said: This is analogous to a flesh and blood king who was marrying off his daughter. He summoned a villager to serve as an intermediary between them [the king and his prospective son-in-law’s family]. He [the villager] began speaking presumptuously with him [the king]. The king said: ‘Who caused you to be so arrogant? Surely it was me, who appointed you intermediary.’ Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Who caused you to speak these words? It was I, who elevated you.’ Rabbi Yehuda said: So said Moses: ‘When You said to me: “Go now, and I will send you to Pharaoh” (Exodus 3:10), You said to me that you are destined to deliver them with the attribute of mercy. Perhaps by the time I came it was transformed into the attribute of justice.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “I am the Lord.” I remain in the attribute of mercy; that is: “And said to him: I am the Lord.” 
“I appeared to Abraham” – The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Alas for those who are lost and are not present.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">An expression of loss over the deceased.</i> Many times I have revealed Myself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but I did not make known to them that My name is the Lord as I made known to you, yet they did not question My ways. I said to Abraham: “Arise, walk through the length and the breath of the land…” (Genesis 13:17). He sought to bury Sarah and did not find a place until he purchased it, and he did not question My ways. I said to Isaac: “Reside in this land… [for I will give all these lands] to you and your descendants…” (Genesis 26:3). He sought to drink water but did not find, but rather, “the shepherds of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's shepherds, [saying: The water is ours…]” (Genesis 26:20) and he did not question My ways. I said to Jacob: “The land on which you lie [I will give to you and to your descendants]” (Genesis 28:13). He sought a place to pitch his tent but did not find until he purchased one for one hundred <i>kesita</i>, and he did not question my ways, and did not ask Me what My name is, as you asked.’ <br>‘But you, at the beginning of [receiving] My mission you said to Me: What is Your name? In the end, you said: “Since I came to Pharaoh [to speak in Your name, he has harmed this people, and You did not deliver Your people]” (Exodus 5:23). Regarding that, it is stated: “I have also established My covenant…[to give them the land of Canaan…]” (Exodus 6:4), that it was given to them, as I said to them that I would give the land to them, and they did not question Me. “Moreover, I have heard the cry of the children of Israel” (Exodus 6:5) – because they did not question Me, even though Israel in that generation were not conducting themselves properly, I heard their cry because of the covenant that I had established with their ancestors.’ That is what is written: “And I have remembered My covenant” (Exodus 6:5). <br><b>“Therefore say to the children of Israel: I am the Lord, and I will take you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their labor, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments. And I will take you to Me as a people, and I will be to you a God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of Egypt ” (Exodus 6:6-7).</b> <br>“Therefore [<i>lakhen</i>] say to the children of Israel” – <i>lakhen</i> is nothing other than the language of oath-taking, as it is stated: “Therefore [<i>velakhen</i>] I took an oath to the house of Eli” (I Samuel 3:14). The Holy One blessed be He took an oath that He would redeem them, so that Moses would not fear that perhaps the attribute of justice would delay their redemption. <br>“I will take you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians…” There are four redemptions here: “I will take out…I will deliver…I will redeem…I will take,” corresponding to the four decrees that Pharaoh decreed against them.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:12. The four decrees are: 1) Hard labor to build the storehouse cities, 2) Killing the newborn males, 3) Casting the newborn sons into the Nile, 4) Withholding straw from brick production.</i> Corresponding to them, the Sages instituted four cups on Passover eve, to fulfill what is stated: “I will raise the cup of salvation and call upon the name of God” (Psalms 116:13). <br><b>“And I will bring you into the land about which I raised my hand, to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you as a heritage; I am the Lord” (Exodus 6:8).</b> <br>“And I will bring you into the land about which I raised my hand.” I will do for them what I said to your ancestors – that I would give them the Land, and they would inherit it by their [the forefathers] merit.
<b>“Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they did not heed Moses because of lack of spirit, and because of hard labor” (Exodus 6:9).</b>  <br>“Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they did not heed Moses…” It was difficult for them to forsake idol worship. So explains Ezekiel and says: “Each man, cast away the detestable objects of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt” (Ezekiel 20:7). See what is written: “Each man did not cast away his detestable objects and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt” (Ezekiel 20:8). <br><b>“Come speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he will let the children of Israel go out of his land” (Exodus 6:11).</b> <br>“Come speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt.” The parable says: “From the acacia tree there is pleasure only when it is cut.” “Moses spoke [<i>vayedaber</i>] before the Lord [saying: Behold, the children of Israel did not heed me. How will Pharaoh heed me, as I have obstructed lips?”] (Exodus 6:12). <sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps Moses is saying to God that only if he approaches Pharaoh forcefully [<i>dabar</i>] will it work, in accordance with the parable. Or perhaps the parable is a response to Moses’s statement that Pharaoh will not listen to his speech. In any case, speech is irrelevant since Pharaoh will permit the people to go only after he is broken with plagues.</i>

<b>“The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and commanded them concerning the children of Israel and concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt, to take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 6:13).</b> <br>“The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and commanded them concerning the children of Israel” – that is what is written: “In all toil there is profit, but the talk of the lips brings only lack” (Proverbs 14:23). For all matters in which a person expends effort for the sake of Torah, he is rewarded. Could it be so even in matters of futility? The verse states: “But the talk of the lips brings only lack.” <br>You find that Joseph was deserving to be placed in prison for only ten years because he slandered his ten brothers; but because he said to the butler: “If only you remember me with you…and mention me to Pharaoh” (Genesis 40:14), two additional years were added for him, as it is stated: “It was at the end of two years” (Genesis 41:1). Likewise you find in Moses’s regard; initially, he was worthy to have the divine speech commune with him by himself, but because he said: “Please…send by means of whom You will send” (Exodus 4:13), it was stated to him: “Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite?” (Exodus 4:14). Here, too, “[Moses spoke before the Lord saying:] Behold, the children of Israel did not heed me…” (Exodus 6:12); he was worthy to have all the miracles performed through him, but because of this the divine speech communed with [both] him and Aaron, as it is stated: “The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron.”
That is what is written: “Behold, all these God will do, twice, three times to a man” (Job 33:29). Three times He waits for a person; if he repents, excellent, and if not, He brings upon him [punishment] for the first ones. Likewise, you find that when the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Go, and I will send you to Pharaoh” (Exodus 3:10), initially he said: “But they will not believe me” (Exodus 4:1), then he said: “I am not a man of words” (Exodus 4:10), then he said: “Please…send by means of whom You will send” (Exodus 4:13). These are three times. Since he did not recant, and said: “Behold, the children of Israel did not heed me” (Exodus 6:12), the divine speech communed with Aaron with him; that is what is written: “The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron.”
“And commanded them concerning the children of Israel…” – the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘My children are naysayers, they are irritable, they are burdensome. Accept it upon yourself in full knowledge that they will curse you [and] they will stone you with stones.’ <br>“And concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt, to take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt” – the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Treat him with deference and accord respect to royalty, even though I must execute justice against him.’ Moses did so, as it is stated: “All these servants of yours will come down to me [and will bow down to me, saying: Leave, you and all the people who are with you]” (Exodus 11:8). He did not say it about him, but only about his servants, even though he should have said: ‘You and your king,’ as [Pharaoh] himself came, as it is stated: “Pharaoh rose at night, [he and all his servants.… He called for Moses and Aaron by night and said: Rise, go out from among my people]” (Exodus 12:30–31). The reason he did not mention him was in order to accord respect to royalty. Rabbi Yaakov says: What is “and commanded them”? The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Include the leaders among them with you,’ as you find written thereafter: “These are the heads of their fathers’ houses” (Exodus 6:14).
Another interpretation: “Concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt” – Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a king who had an orchard and he planted non-fruit-bearing trees and fruit trees in it. His servants said to him: ‘What pleasure do you get from these non-fruit-bearing trees?’ He said to them: ‘Just as I need fruit trees, so too I need the non-fruit-bearing trees, as were it not for the non-fruit-bearing trees, with what would I make bathhouses and furnaces?’ That is why it says: “Concerning the children of Israel and concerning Pharaoh” – just as the praise of the Holy One blessed be He rises to Him from the Garden of Eden from the mouths of the righteous, so too it rises from Gehenna from the mouths of the wicked, as it is stated: “They pass through a valley of tears,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Gehenna.</i> they render it a place of springs” (Psalms 84:7). What is “they render it a place of springs”? They shed tears like springs until they cool Gehenna with their tears. The praise rises from there, as it is stated: “Blessings cover the early rain [<i>moreh</i>]” (Psalms 84:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to God who is the Teacher [<i>moreh</i>] of all creatures.</i> What do they say? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You have said well, You have judged well, You have purified well, You have impurified well, You have condemned well, You have taught well, and You have ruled well. <br>The Garden of Eden is destined to shout and say: Give me the righteous, I have no interest in the wicked, as it is stated: “I hate those who regard empty folly” (Psalms 31:7). Whom do I seek? Those who trusted in Your name, as it is stated: “But I trust in the Lord” (Psalms 31:7). <br>Gehenna is destined to shout and say: I have no interest in the righteous. Whom do I seek? The wicked: “Empty folly,” those who engage in folly. The Holy One blessed be He says: ‘Give this one the righteous and this one the wicked,’ as it is stated: “The leech has two daughters” (Proverbs 30:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This represents the grave and the two paths emanating from it, the Garden of Eden and Gehenna. </i>
<b>“These are the heads of their fathers' houses; the sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Ḥanokh, and Palu, Ḥetzron, and Karmi. These are the families of Reuben” (Exodus 6:14).</b> <br>“These are the heads of their fathers’ houses” <the entire midrash as it is explained in <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba </i>4:7>. <br><b>“Aaron took for himself Elisheva, daughter of Aminadav, sister of Naḥshon, as a wife; she bore him Nadav and Avihu, Elazar and Itamar” (Exodus 6:23).</b> <br>“Aaron took for himself Elisheva, daughter of Aminadav” – from the fact that it says “daughter of Aminadav,” do I not know that she was the sister of Naḥshon? Rather, it is to teach you that anyone who marries a woman should examine her brothers. We similarly learned that most sons resemble the brothers of the mother. <br><b>“Elazar, Aaron's son, took for himself from the daughters of Putiel as a wife; and she bore him Pinḥas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites according to their families” (Exodus 6:25).</b> <br>“Elazar, Aaron's son, took for himself from the daughters of Putiel…” – it is not stated: Daughter of Putiel, but rather, “from the daughters of Putiel,” as his wife was from two families, from the tribe of Joseph, who overcame [<i>pitpet</i>] his evil inclination, and from the other side she came from Yitro, who fattened [<i>pitem</i>] calves for idol worship. <br><b>“This is Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said: Take the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their hosts. It was they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to take the children of Israel out of Egypt. This is Moses and Aaron.” (Exodus 6:26–27).</b> <br>“This is Aaron and Moses” – “It was they who spoke.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentaries note that the midrash cites these verses without saying anything about them, and suggest that this text may be entirely unnecessary and a scribal error (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). Others suggest that the midrash means to imply that the genealogies mentioned until this point (Exodus 6:14–25) are detailed merely in order to provide context for Moses and Aaron, who served as messengers of God (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>). </i>

Chapter 8

<b>“It was on the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 6:28). <br>“The Lord said to Moses: See, I have set you as god to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother will be your prophet” (Exodus 7:1).</b> <br>“It was on the day when the Lord.… The Lord said to Moses: See, I have set you as god to Pharaoh” – that is what is written: “Lift your heads, gates” (Psalms 24:7). Solomon recited this verse when he was taking the Ark into the Holy of Holies. He crafted an Ark that was ten cubits [wide]. When he arrived at the entrance of the Temple, the entrance was ten cubits and the Ark was ten cubits, and ten cubits are unable to enter into ten cubits. Moreover, they were carrying it [and there was certainly not enough space for those bearing the Ark to enter]. When he came to take it in, he was unable to do so. Solomon stood and was embarrassed and did not know what to do. He began praying before the Holy One blessed be He. <br>What did Solomon do? Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, say: He went and brought David’s coffin, and said: “Lord, God, do not turn away the face of Your anointed” (II Chronicles 6:42). Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: At that moment, David came alive, as you may expound [from the verse]: “Lord, You took up my soul from the grave, you kept me alive so I would not descent into the pit” (Psalms 30:4). Solomon was saying: ‘Master of the universe, do so due to the merit of this one,’ as it is stated: “Remember the kindnesses of David Your servant” (II Chronicles 6:42). Immediately, [his prayer] was answered. What is written thereafter? “When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the offerings, and the glory of the Lord filled the house” (II Chronicles 7:1). The Divine Spirit was shouting and saying: “I praise the dead who are already dead more than the living who are still alive” (Ecclesiastes 4:2). <br>Solomon began saying: “Lift your heads, gates, and be uplifted, everlasting doors; and the King of glory will come” (Psalms 24:7). The gates said to him: “Who then is the King of glory?” (Psalms 24:10). He said to them: “The Lord of Hosts; He is the king of glory. Selah” (Psalms 24:10). When he said this to them, they were immediately calmed. Had it not been so, they would have attempted to crush his skull to kill him. <br>Another interpretation: “Who then is the King of glory?” – why did he call the Holy One blessed be He the King of glory? It is because He allots glory to those who fear Him. How so? A king of flesh and blood, one does not ride his horse and one does not sit on his throne. But the Holy One blessed be He seated Solomon on His throne, as it is stated: “Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king” (I Chronicles 29:23), and He had Elijah ride on His horse. What is the horse of the Holy One blessed be He? It is the whirlwind and the storm, as it is stated: “The Lord, in the whirlwind and in the storm is His way, and the clouds are the dust of His feet” (Nahum 1:3). And it is written: “Elijah went up by the whirlwind to the heavens” (II Kings 2:11). <br>A king of flesh and blood, one does not use his scepter; but the Holy One blessed be He passed His scepter to Moses, as it is stated: “Moses took the staff of God in his hand” (Exodus 4:20). A king of flesh and blood, one does not wear his crown; but the Holy One blessed be He is destined to place His crown on the messianic king. What is the crown of the Holy One blessed be He? It is the finest gold, as it is stated: “His head is the finest gold; his locks are curled, black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11), and it is written: “You set a crown of fine gold on his head” (Psalms 21:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse refers to the messianic king. </i> A king of flesh and blood, one does not don his garments; but Israel dons the garments of the Holy One blessed be He. What are the garments of the Holy One blessed be He? Strength, as it is stated: “The Lord is clothed, He had girded Himself with strength” (Psalms 93:1). He gave it to Israel, as it is stated: “The Lord will give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace” (Psalms 29:11). <br>A king of flesh and blood, one is not called by his name, [such as] Caesar Augustus, and one who is called by his name, they would execute him; but the Holy One blessed be He called Moses by His name, as it is stated: “See, I have set you as god to Pharaoh.” The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘The wicked Pharaoh made himself a god, as it is stated: “My river is mine, and I have made it for myself” (Ezekiel 29:3); therefore, he will see you and say: This is a god.’
Pharaoh was one of four people who rendered themselves deities and [thereby] caused themselves harm, and they are: Ḥiram, Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, and Yoash king of Judah. Ḥiram, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Say to the prince of Tyre…and you said: I am a god” (Ezekiel 28:2). From where is it derived that he destroyed himself? It is as it is stated: “Your heart was elevated because of your beauty, you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness; I have cast you to the ground, I have placed you before kings to gaze upon you” (Ezekiel 28:17). <br>Nebuchadnezzar, from where is it derived that he rendered himself a deity? It is as it is written: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High” (Isaiah 14:14). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Yet you shall be brought down to the grave, to the depths of the pit” (Isaiah 14:15). What did the Holy One blessed be He do to him? He exiled him to the wilderness while he was still reigning, and fed him grass like animals [eat], as it is stated: “And ate grass like oxen” (Daniel 4:30). And the animals and the beasts would see him in the image of a female, as it is stated: “And the destruction of the beasts, which made them afraid [<i>yeḥitan</i>]; because of men's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city…” (Habakkuk 2:17), similar to the matter that is stated: “You shall not marry [<i>titḥaten</i>] them” (Deuteronomy 7:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that the other animals will force themselves upon this animal, i.e., Nebuchadnezzar.</i> Nevertheless, “a man’s heart was given to it” (Daniel 7:4),<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even when Nebuchadnezzar was in that state, he was still able to appreciate that all of this was from God to subdue him.</i> as it is written: “And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to the heavens, and my understanding returned to me” (Daniel 4:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The verse concludes: “I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored Him who lives forever; for His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom from generation to generation.”</i> <br>Pharaoh, from where is it derived that he rendered himself a deity? It is as it is stated: “My river is mine, and I have made it for myself” (Ezekiel 29:3). The Holy One blessed be He delivered him into the hand of his enemies, as it is stated: “So said the Lord: Behold, I will give Pharaoh Ḥofra king of Egypt [into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life]” (Jeremiah 44:30). What is Ḥofra? It is similar to the matter that is stated: “He shall loosen [<i>ufara</i>] the hair on the woman’s head and put the meal offering of memorial in her hands” (Numbers 5:18), and it is written: “On that day, Egypt will be like women” (Isaiah 19:16). <br>Yoash, from where is it derived that he rendered himself a deity? It is as it is written: “After the death of Yehoyada the princes of Judah came and prostrated themselves before the king; then the king listened to them” (II Chronicles 24:17). What is “and prostrated themselves before the king”? It is that they rendered him a deity. They said to him: ‘Were you not a god, you would not have emerged from the Holy of Holies after seven years.’ He said to them: ‘This is so.’ He accepted upon himself to be rendered a deity, and engendered his demise, as it is stated: “It was at the turn of the year that the Aramean army rose against him” (II Chronicles 24:23), and it is written: “They executed judgment [<i>shefatim</i>] upon Yoash” (II Chronicles 24:24). Do not read it as <i>shefatim</i>, but rather as <i>shefutim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the verse: “They exposed her nakedness…she became a byword among women, for judgments [<i>shefutim</i>] were executed upon her” (Ezekiel 23:10).</i> and it is written: “When they departed from him, as they left him with great diseases…he died…but they did not bury him in the burials of the kings” (II Chronicles 24:25). <br>What caused Pharaoh to be stricken? It is because he said: “My river is mine, and I have made it for myself.” That is why the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “See, I have set you as god to Pharaoh.” “For one higher than the high is watching, and there are higher than they” (Ecclesiastes 5:7). Go and render he who rendered himself a deity despicable in the world, because he elevated himself, as it is stated: “He sees all the elevated, He is king over all the despicable” (Job 41:26). Does He see only the elevated, and the lowly He does not see? But is it not written: “The eyes of the Lord, they range over the entire earth” (Zechariah 4:10)? Rather, Rabbi Berekhya said: These are the haughty who render themselves deities, and the Holy One blessed be He renders them despicable in the world. <br>Likewise, Sennacherib was haughty and was rendered despicable in the world, as it is stated: “It was that night, the angel of the Lord emerged, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand” (II Kings 19:35) men. That is why it is written: “He sees all the elevated”; the Holy One blessed be He shows the despicableness of the haughty to all beings. <br>The Holy One blessed be He said: “Can a man hide himself in secret places and I will not see him? – says the Lord” (Jeremiah 23:24). Rabbi Binyamin bar Levi said: [God says:] If a person sits in the corner and engages in Torah study, I display him to the people. If a person conceals himself for idol worship, I display him to the people, as it is stated: “Can a man hide himself in secret places and I will not see him?” Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: [God says:] I fill the upper and the lower worlds with him, and show his degradation to the people. That is why the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “See, I have set you as god to Pharaoh.”
‘Go and exact retribution from him’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When God said to Moses: “I have set you as god to Pharaoh,” He was saying: Go exact retribution [<i>hipara</i>] from him. </i> – he said to Him: ‘How will I bring upon him ten plagues?’ He said to him: “You shall take in your hand this staff” (Exodus 4:17). Rabbi Yehuda said: The weight of the staff was forty <i>se’a</i>, and it was made of sapphire, and the ten plagues were etched on it in acronym form, <i>detzakh adash be’aḥav</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is an acronym of the initials of the plagues: Blood [<i>dam</i>], frogs [<i>tzefarde’a</i>], lice [<i>kinnim</i>] – <i>detzakh</i>; wild beasts [<i>arov</i>], pestilence [<i>dever</i>], boils [<i>shekhin</i>] –<i> adash</i>; hail [<i>barad</i>], locusts [<i>arbeh</i>], darkness [<i>ḥoshekh</i>], firstborn [<i>bekhorot</i>] – <i>be’aḥav</i>.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘In this order, bring the plagues upon him.’ <br>“And Aaron your brother will be your prophet” – just as the lecturer sits and lectures and the <i>amora</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">After the lecturer stated an excerpt of the lecture that was heard only by the <i>amora</i>, the <i>amora</i> would repeat it in loud voice and occasionally elaborate upon it for the benefit of the audience.</i> speaks before him, so too, “you shall speak everything that I command you; and Aaron your brother will speak to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:2), and all the matters were accomplished by the two of them, as it is stated: “Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders” (Exodus 11:10).

Chapter 9

<b>“When Pharaoh will speak to you, saying: Provide a wonder for you; then you shall say to Aaron: Take your staff, and cast it before Pharaoh, it will become a serpent” (Exodus 7:9).</b> <br>“When Pharaoh will speak to you” – Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Ḥama began: “Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times matters that have not been done; saying: My counsel will stand, and all My desire I will do” (Isaiah 46:10) – the Holy One blessed be He declares at the beginning what will be at the end, as He says to Moses: “This people will rise, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land” (Deuteronomy 31:16), which they were destined to do after the death of Joshua: “And they will forsake Me, and breach My covenant” (Deuteronomy 31:16); “they forsook the Lord and did not worship Him” (Judges 10:6). That is “declaring the end from the beginning.” <br>Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Ḥama said: Anyone who reads this verse thinks that perhaps there is a dispute on High, as He says: “My counsel will stand [and all My desire I will do].” What is “and all My desire I will do”? It is that He desires to vindicate His creations, as it is stated: “The Lord desires for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and glorious” (Isaiah 42:21), and does not seek to condemn any creature, as it is stated: “I have no desire in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked repent from his way and live” (Ezekiel 33:11). Therefore, it is stated: “And all My desire I will do.” Likewise you find that the Holy One blessed be He told Moses the end from the beginning; it is not written: If Pharaoh will speak to you, but rather, “when [Pharaoh] will speak”; he is destined to say this to you. <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom said: He is speaking appropriately: “Provide a wonder for you.” Likewise, you find with Noah, after all the miracles that the Holy One blessed be He performed for him in the ark, and He took him out of it, He said to him: “And the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh” (Genesis 9:15). [Noah] began asking for a sign,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">That there would never again be a flood.</i> until the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “I have set My rainbow in the cloud” (Genesis 9:13); if the righteous Noah asked for a sign, all the more so, the wicked Pharaoh [would]. <br>Likewise, you find with Hezekiah, when Isaiah came and said to him: “So says the Lord…I will heal you; on the third day you will go up to the house of the Lord” (II Kings 20:5), he began asking for a sign, as it is stated: “Hezekiah said…what is the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I will go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?” (II Kings 20:8). If the righteous Hezekiah asked for a sign, all the more so, the wicked Pharaoh [would]. <br>Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, when they descended into the fiery furnace, they descended only with a sign. How so? “Not to us, Lord, not to us” (Psalms 115:1), said Ḥananya. “To Your name give glory” (Psalms 115:1), said Mishael. “For Your kindness and for Your truth” (Psalms 115:1), said Azarya. Gabriel was answering after them: “Why should the nations say: Where [now is their God?]” (Psalms 115:2). Once this became fluent in their mouths all night, they took that as a sign and descended.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">They took as a sign the fact that their prayer was fluent in their mouths. See <i>Berakhot</i> 34b. </i> <br>If you cannot learn it from here, learn it from another source, as it is written: “Hear now, Yehoshua the High Priest, you and your counterparts who sit before you; as they are men of a sign” (Zechariah 3:8). Who were they? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom said: They were Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, for whom this sign was performed.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the sign that they received before descending into the furnace. </i> If the righteous seek a sign, all the more so, the wicked [Pharaoh would].
“Then you shall say to Aaron: Take your staff” – that is what is written: “The staff of Your strength the Lord will send from Zion” (Psalms 110:2). The Holy One blessed be He subjugates the wicked only with a staff. Why? It is because they are likened to dogs, as it is stated: “They return in the evening, they howl like a dog” (Psalms 59:15); just as it is the way of a dog to be beaten with a staff, so too, they are beaten. That is why it is stated: “The staff of Your strength” – the Holy One blessed be He said: Pharaoh is wicked. If he says to you: “Provide a wonder for you,” beat him with a staff, as it is stated: “Say to Aaron: Take your staff” (Exodus 7:19).
“Cast it before Pharaoh, it will become a serpent” – we learned [regarding] one who stands in prayer: Even if the king greets him, he should not respond to him; and even if a serpent is wrapped around his heel, he should not interrupt [his prayer] (Mishna <i>Berakhot </i>5:1). What did the Sages see that led them to liken the wrapping of a serpent to the kingdom of Egypt? Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: It is as it is written: “Its sound will go like a serpent” (Jeremiah 46:22);<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The prophecy in Jeremiah, chap. 46 is stated regarding Egypt. </i> just as a serpent hisses and kills, so too, the Egyptian kingdom hisses and kills, as it places one in prison, falsely accuses him, and kills him. Alternatively, what did the Holy One blessed be He see that led Him to liken the kingdom of Egypt to a serpent? Just as a serpent is curved [<i>me’ukam</i>], so too, the kingdom of Egypt acts deceitfully. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: Just as a serpent is curved, so too Pharaoh is deceitful [<i>me’ukam</i>]. When he comes to be deceitful, tell Aaron, and he shall raise the staff before him, as though to say: With this you will be struck.
Another interpretation: Why did He say to them the miracle of the serpent? It is because Pharaoh was likened to a serpent, as it is stated: “[Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt,] the great serpent that lies in the midst of his rivers” (Ezekiel 29:3). When Moses would exit from Pharaoh, [Pharaoh] would say: If the son of Amram will come to me, I will behead him, I will hang him, I will burn him. When Moses would enter, immediately, Pharaoh became a staff.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Like a dry piece of wood, he did nothing.</i>
<b>“Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and they did so, as the Lord commanded; Aaron cast his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent” (Exodus 7:10).</b> <br>“Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh” – should not Aaron have entered first, as he was greater in years than him? Why Moses? It is because he was greater than him in Egypt, as it is stated: “The man, Moses, too, was very great [in the land of Egypt]” (Exodus 11:3). Alternatively, because the Holy One blessed be He rendered Moses as god over Aaron, as it is stated: “And you will be to him as god” (Exodus 4:16), and it is appropriate for the master to enter first. <br>“And they did so, as the Lord commanded” – in that they did not do so until Pharaoh requested a wonder, just as the Holy One blessed be He said. At that moment, “Aaron cast his staff.”
<b>“Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers; and they too, the magicians of Egypt, did so with their spells” (Exodus 7:11).</b> <br>“Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers.” At that moment, Pharaoh began laughing at them and clucking at them like a hen, saying to them: ‘Are these the signs of your God? The way of the world is that people bring merchandise to a place that needs it. Do they bring fish brine to Spain, fish to Akko? Do you not know that all sorcery is in my control?’ Immediately, he sent and brought children from their schools, and they too performed this [wonder]. Moreover, he called his wife and she did so, as it is stated: “Pharaoh also [<i>gam</i>] called.” What is <i>gam</i>? It is that he called even his wife and she did so. “They too [<i>gam</i>], the magicians of Egypt, did so.” What is <i>gam</i>? It is that he called even four- and five-year-old children, and they did so.
<b>“Each man cast his staff, and they became serpents, and Aaron's staff swallowed their staffs” (Exodus 7:12).</b> <br>“Each man cast his staff” – Yoḥani and Mamre<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">These were two of the head sorcerers.</i> said to Moses: ‘Are you taking straw to Ofriyim?’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is the agricultural equivalent of taking coals to Newcastle.</i> He said to them: ‘To a city of vegetables take vegetables.’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It is because people go there to purchase vegetables.</i> <br>“Aaron's staff swallowed their staffs” – that is what is written: “A fool expends all his spirit; but a wise man stills it within him” (Proverbs 29:11). The fool expresses his claims all at once when he comes to quarrel with another, while the wise man ultimately marginalizes him. Alternatively: “A fool expends all his spirit” – this wicked one, after he finishes expressing his entire counsel, the Wise One of the world “stills it within him.” <br>As you find with Aḥashverosh, who stood and abrogated work on the Temple; that is why he ruled over only half the world. What is written in his regard? “With his display of the wealth of his glorious kingdom [and the honor of his splendid majesty, for many days; one hundred and eighty days]” (Esther 1:4). Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: He would show them six hidden treasures<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on six Hebrew expressions in the verse: The wealth [<i>osher</i>] of his glorious [<i>kevod</i>] kingdom [<i>malkhuto</i>] and the honor [<i>yekar</i>] of his splendid [<i>tiferet</i>] majesty [<i>gedulato</i>]<i>.</i></i> on each and every day, one unlike the other, and then he would send them to all the prominent members of the kingdom. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: He showed the various expenditures. Rabbi Levi says: He showed then the priestly vestments; here it is stated: “His splendid majesty” (Esther 1:4), and there it is stated: “You shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother [for glory and for splendor]” (Exodus 28:2). Just as splendor stated there refers to the vestments of the High Priest, so too, splendor stated here refers to the vestments of the High Priest. “But a wise man stills it within him” – the Holy One blessed be He subverted his counsel, and he killed Vashti. <br>Another interpretation: “A fool expends all his spirit” – this is Pharaoh, who was mocking the Holy One blessed be He, as he believed that what Moses and Aaron had done was [achieved by] sorcery, and he called all the members of his household to do what they had done. That is “A fool expends all his spirit” – this is Pharaoh. “But a wise man stills it within him” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Wise of heart and mighty in strength” (Job 9:4). At that moment the Holy One blessed be He said: If the serpent will swallow the serpents of the Egyptians, it is the way of the world, a serpent swallowing a serpent. Rather, let it return to its original state and swallow the serpents. What is “And Aaron's staff swallowed their staffs”? Rabbi Elazar said: It was a miracle within a miracle; it teaches that the staff returned to its original form of a staff and swallowed them. When Pharaoh saw this, he was astonished and said: What if he were to say to the staff: Swallow Pharaoh and his throne; would it then swallow him? <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: A great miracle was performed to the staff, as even though it swallowed all the staffs that they had cast, which were numerous enough to fill ten <i>omer</i>, it did not thicken. Anyone who saw it would say: This is Aaron’s staff.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is derived from the language of the verse: “And Aaron’s staff swallowed their staffs.” </i> From here on, Aaron’s staff was a positive sign with which to perform miracles and wonders throughout the generations. <br>
<b>“Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not heed them, as the Lord had spoken. The Lord said to Moses: Pharaoh's heart is stubborn, he refuses to let the people go.

Just as the liver [<i>kaved</i>] becomes angry,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The liver was regarded as the seat of anger; see <i>Berakhot</i> 61b. </i> so, too, this one’s heart became like a liver; he does not understand, he is a fool: “As anger rests in the bosom of fools” (Ecclesiastes 7:9). With what do you chastise the fool? With a staff, as it is stated: “A rod to the back of fools” (Proverbs 26:3). Moses, too, chastised Pharaoh with a staff, as it is stated: “and the staff that was transformed into a serpent [you shall take in your hand].” <br>Another interpretation: “Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn [<i>kaved</i>]” – the Holy One blessed be He said to him: Wicked one, with the expression with which you honored yourself,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh honored himself by refusing to humble himself before God. The midrash here is interpreting the word <i>kaved</i> in the sense of <i>kavod</i>, honor. </i> with the same expression I will be honored at your expense, as it is stated: “When I have gained honor [<i>behikavedi</i>] through Pharaoh” (Exodus 14:18). <br>“Go to Pharaoh in the morning; behold, he goes out to the water” – he would go out to the water only in the morning, because that wicked one would boast and assert that he was a deity and did not need to relieve himself; therefore, he would go out in the morning. Catch him in the morning when he needs to relieve himself. “And the staff that was transformed into a serpent you shall take in your hand” so that he will be afraid of it.
<b>“You shall say to him: The Lord, God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying: Let My people go, and they will serve Me in the wilderness; and, behold, you have not heeded until now.

It is the way of the world that when a human being seeks to bring harm to his enemy, he brings it upon him suddenly so he will not sense it [is coming]; but the Holy One blessed be He forewarned Pharaoh for each and every plague so he would repent; this is what is written: “With this you will know that I am the Lord”; “Behold, I will strike all your borders with frogs (Exodus 7:27); “send and gather” (Exodus 9:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is the forewarning that preceded the plague of hail.</i> <br>“On the water that is in the Nile, and it will be turned into blood” – why was the water afflicted first with blood?

This is a folk parable: Smite the gods and the priests will be afraid.

<b>“The fish that are in the Nile will die and the Nile will become foul; and the Egyptians will loathe to drink water from the Nile.

How so? If an Egyptian and an Israelite were in one house and the tub was full of water, and the Egyptian went to fill the jug from it, he would remove it filled with blood, but the Israelite would drink water from the tub. The Egyptian would say: ‘Give me a little water with your hand.’ He would give it to him, and it would become blood. He would say to him: ‘Let you and I drink water from one bowl,’ and the Israelite would drink water and the Egyptian blood. But when he would purchase it from the Israelite with money, he would drink water. From this, Israel became wealthy.
<b>“The magicians of Egypt did so with their spells; and Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he did not heed them, as the Lord had spoken” (Exodus 7:22).</b> <br>“The magicians of Egypt did so” – this teaches that they believed it was an act of sorcery. “With their spells [<i>belateihem</i>]” – Rabbi Aivo bar Nagrei said that Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: <i>Belateihem</i> is an act of demons; <i>belahateihem</i> (Exodus 7:11) is an act of sorcery. Likewise it says: “And the flame [<i>lahat</i>] of the ever-turning sword, to guard the way to the tree of life” (Genesis 3:24), as all acts of sorcery are performed by angels of destruction. <br><b>“Pharaoh turned and came to his house, and he did not take this to heart either” (Exodus 7:23).</b> <br>“Pharaoh turned” – he was not concerned, and did not take heed of God’s plague. <br><b>“All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink, as they could not drink from the water of the Nile” (Exodus 7:24).</b> <br>“All the Egyptians dug around the Nile” – Rabbi Yehuda says: Only [the water] in the Nile was afflicted.

This is analogous to a servant who was being beaten by his master on his stomach, and he would turn himself around and receive the beatings on his back. So, too, the Nile would reverse [<i>mehapekh</i>] itself so that the plague would not affect it, but it was to no avail, as all of its water turned into blood. <br>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin said: A generalization, a detail, and a generalization, you may infer only matters similar to the detail. “Over the water of Egypt” (Exodus 7:19) – this is a generalization; “over their rivers, over their streams, and over their ponds” (Exodus 7:19) – this is a detail; “and over all their pools of water” (Exodus 7:19) – this is another generalization. What do you include [in the inference]?

Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, say: Even their idols were afflicted with blood, as it is stated: “They say to wood: You are my father” (Jeremiah 2:27). <br>Another interpretation: “And in the wood and in the stone” (Exodus 7:19) – the water that they would drink with a Jew in one vessel, in a wooden vessel or in a stone vessel, would be transformed into blood in his mouth. Some say that even their pedestals and their lavatories were afflicted with blood. When one of them would go and sit on a bed, on a stone, or on a boulder, they would ruin their garments with blood. Likewise, it says: “The blood was throughout the land of Egypt” (Exodus 7:21.
<b>“Seven days were completed, after the Lord had struck the Nile” (Exodus 7:25).</b> <br>“Seven days were completed, after the Lord had struck the Nile” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: One says: For twenty-four days he would forewarn them before the plague began, and for seven days the plague would affect them. And one says: For seven days he would forewarn them, and for twenty-four days the plague would affect them. According to the one who says that for twenty-four days he would forewarn them, “seven days were completed” for the plague. According to the one who says that for seven days he would forewarn them, “seven days were completed after the Lord had struck,” during which he would forewarn them regarding another plague.

And because they burned the house of the Holy One blessed be He, about which it is written: “The house was filled with smoke” (Isaiah 6:4); therefore, “its smoke will rise [forever]” (Isaiah 34:10).

How so? There was a dispute between the Kushites and the Egyptians. The Egyptians claimed: Our borders are until here, and the Kushites claimed: Our borders are until here. Once the frogs came they made peace between them.

Rather, it teaches that a frog would ascend from the depths and say to the marble: ‘Make room for me so I can ascend and perform the will of my Creator.’ The marble would split, and [the frog] would [then] ascend and remove their genitals and neuter them, as it is stated: “And frogs that destroyed them [<i>vatashḥitem</i>]” (Psalms 78:45), as it is stated: “Because their corruption [<i>moshḥatam</i>] is in them” (Leviticus 22:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is written in the context of the prohibition to bring a castrated animal as an offering.</i>

<b>“Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said: Entreat the Lord, and He will remove the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, and they will sacrifice to the Lord.

Therefore, Moses said to him: “For what time shall I entreat for you?” – for tomorrow I will entreat for you, but not for today; [and only then,] “the frogs will depart from you” (Exodus 8:7).
<b>“Moses and Aaron emerged from Pharaoh; and Moses cried to the Lord regarding the frogs that He had brought upon Pharaoh” (Exodus 8:8).</b> <br>“Moses…emerged…and…cried to the Lord regarding the frogs” – our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: It was not just the destruction that the frogs caused the Egyptians, but the sound of the frogs was harsher for them than the physical damage, as they would enter their bodies and scream inside them, as it is stated: “Regarding [<i>al devar</i>] the frogs that He had brought upon Pharaoh” – regarding the speech [<i>al dibur</i>] of the frogs. <br><b>“The Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died from the houses, from the courts, and from the fields” (Exodus 8:9).</b> <br>“The Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died” – it is because [the Egyptians] could derive no benefit from their carcasses or their skin; that is why they died.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is in contrast to the wild animals and the locusts, which departed from Egypt (see Exodus 8:27 and 10:19) so that the Egyptians would not benefit from the hides of the animals or be able to eat the locusts. </i> <br><b>“They gathered them in heaps; and the land stank” (Exodus 8:10).</b> <br>“They gathered them in heaps” – this teaches that each and every one of them made four piles, and the land reeked.

[He will stand before kings; he will not stand before the dark]” (Proverbs 22:29), as it is written [on the verse: “All the work was finished” (I Kings 7:51)].<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to <i>Pesikta Rabati</i> 6, which, commenting on the verse from Kings, states that Moses and other individuals were diligent in their work and therefore stood before kings. </i> Alternatively: “Have you seen a man diligent in his work” – this is Moses, who was diligent in the labor of the Tabernacle; therefore, “he will stand before kings.” Rabbi Yehuda says: “Have you seen a man diligent in his work” – this is Moses, who was diligent in bringing plagues upon Pharaoh. “He will stand before kings” – “stand before Pharaoh.” “He will not stand before the dark” – this is Yitro. <br>Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: According to your statement, you have rendered the sacred profane. Rather, “he will stand before kings” – he will stand before the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights” (Exodus 34:28). “He will not stand before the dark” – this is Pharaoh, for whom and for whose land the Holy One brought darkness, as it is stated: “There was a thick darkness” (Exodus 10:22). <br>“Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh” – why early? Rabbi Berekhya said: It is because the wicked Pharaoh would say: This son of Amram comes and goes to us each and every morning. Rather, before he comes, I will go and depart from here. But the Holy One blessed be He, who examines hearts, said to Moses: ‘Know that this is what this wicked one is planning in his heart; rather, precede him and appear to him before he departs.’ That is why it says: “Rise early in the morning.” <br>Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Rabbi Ḥama said: That is what is written: “The impious of heart will arouse wrath; [they do not cry out when He binds them]” (Job 36:13). After the Holy One blessed be He waits for the wicked to repent, but they do not, even if ultimately they want to do so, He takes their heart so they will not repent. What are “the impious of heart”? They are those who come and are initially impious in their heart; they ultimately bring wrath upon themselves. What is “they do not cry out when He binds them”? Even though they wish to repent to the Holy One blessed be He, and they come and engage in prayer, they are unable to do so. Why? It is because “He binds them”; He locks the door before them. So, Pharaoh wished to engage in prayer, and the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Go stand before him before he departs.’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Announce the next plague before he has the opportunity to pray.</i>
Another interpretation: “Rise early in the morning” – the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘This wicked one hardened his heart during the first three. The fourth plague is more severe than the previous ones; go and forewarn him that he should let My people go so the plague will not come upon him.’ <br><b>“For, if you do not let My people go, behold, I will send swarms upon you, upon your servants, upon your people, and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms, and also the ground on which they are. I will distinguish on that day the land of Goshen, in which My people dwell, that no swarms will be there; so that you will know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth” (Exodus 8:17–18).</b> <br>“For, if you do not let My people go, behold, I will send…upon you…” – from where did they come upon them? Some say from above and some say from below. Rabbi Akiva says: From above and from below. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘You made many multitudes over My children; I, too, will make upon you many multitudes of birds of the heavens and beasts of the land,’ as it is stated: “Behold, I will send swarms upon you” – beasts and birds intermingled. However, in the land of Goshen, in which Israel was residing, there were no swarms, as it is stated: “I will distinguish on that day the land of Goshen.” Rabbi Ami says: It is like a person who says to another: ‘So-and-so will not be included in this penalty, as his patron, so-and-so, is standing over him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">He is protecting them.</i> <br><b>“I will place a division between My people and your people, tomorrow this sign will be” (Exodus 8:19).</b> <br>“I will place a division between My people [and your people]” – this teaches that Israel was fit to be afflicted with this plague, but the Holy One blessed be He placed the Egyptians as their ransom. In the future, too, the Holy One blessed be He will bring (ancient)<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This word, which appears in some editions, was added by the non-Jewish censor.</i> idolaters and cast them into Gehenna in place of Israel, as it is stated: “For I am the Lord your God, Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I gave Egypt as your ransom, Kush and Seva in your stead” (Isaiah 43:3).
<b>“The Lord did so; and heavy swarms came into the house of Pharaoh, and into the house of his servants; and throughout the land of Egypt the land was ruined due to the swarms” (Exodus 8:20).</b> <br>“The Lord did so; and heavy swarms came into the house of Pharaoh” – he was afflicted first, as he began with the wicked counsel first, as it is stated: “Pharaoh commanded…” (Exodus 1:22), and then, “the house of his servants.” <br><b>“Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said: Go sacrifice to your God in the land. Moses said: It is not proper to do so, as we will sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God; behold, were we to sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, would they not stone us?” (Exodus 8:21–22).</b> <br>“Pharaoh called.… Moses said: It is not proper to do so” – because the Egyptians prostrate themselves to these animals as a god. <br><b>“We will go on a three-day journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as He will command us” (Exodus 8:23).</b> <br>“We will go on a three-day journey into the wilderness” – in order to mislead them. <br><b>“Pharaoh said: I will let you go, and you will sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; just do not go very far; entreat for me. Moses said: Behold, I am leaving you, and I will entreat the Lord, and the swarms will depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only let Pharaoh not continue to be deceitful by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord” (Exodus 8:24–25).</b> <br>“Pharaoh said: I will let you go.… Moses said: Behold, I am leaving you” – what is “behold”? The prayer will be immediate, so that the swarm will depart from you tomorrow. That is what is written: “The swarms will depart…[tomorrow].” <br><b>“Moses left Pharaoh, and entreated the Lord. The Lord did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the swarms from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; not one remained” (Exodus 8:26–27).</b> <br>“Moses left.… The Lord did according to the word of Moses; and He removed the swarms” – why did He bring swarms upon them? It is because they would say to Israel: ‘Go out and bring us bears, lions, and leopards,’ in order to torment them; therefore, He brought upon them swarms of beasts; this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya said: [They were] species of hornets and mosquitoes. The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears correct, as regarding the frogs it is written: "The frogs died” (Exodus 8:9), because there was no benefit from their skins; however, regarding the swarms there was [potential] benefit from their hides; therefore, “not one remained.” Had they been hornets or mosquitoes they could have been left to reek.
<b>“For if you refuse to let them go, and continue to hold them, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon your cattle that are in the field, upon the horses, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks; there will be a very severe pestilence” (Exodus 9:2–9:3).</b> <br>“Pharaoh hardened his heart.… The Lord said to Moses.… For if you refuse.… Behold, the hand of the Lord is” (Exodus 8:28–9:3) – why did He bring pestilence upon them? It is because they tasked Israel to be herders of cattle and herders of flocks, and [of] all animals in the mountains and the wildernesses, so they would not procreate. The Holy One blessed be He said: I will bring upon them a fine herder,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is pestilence that will kill their animals, which will no longer require herding.</i> as it is stated: “Behold, the hand of the Lord is [upon your cattle].” <br><b>“The Lord will distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and nothing of all that belongs to the children of Israel will die” (Exodus 9:4).</b> <br>What is “and nothing of all that belongs to the children of Israel will die”? Even an animal that was in the possession of an Egyptian, and an Israelite had a grievance that he owns part of it, would be spared, and that would prove the claim of the Israelite. <br><b>“Pharaoh sent, and behold, not even one of the cattle of the Israelites died. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go” (Exodus 9:7).</b> <br>“The Lord set an appointed time.… The Lord did this matter.… Pharaoh sent…” (Exodus 9:5–7) – what is “not even one”? Even an animal [that] half of it belonged to an Israelite and half of it belonged to an Egyptian did not die.
<b>“The Lord said to Moses and to Aaron: Take for you handfuls of soot of the furnace, and Moses will throw it heavenward before the eyes of Pharaoh” (Exodus 9:8).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses and to Aaron: Take for you handfuls of soot of the furnace” – a great miracle was performed with the boils, as both Moses and Aaron took their handfuls, and Moses’s hand held his handful and Aaron’s handful; from here, a small area can have a large capacity.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">If God wills it.</i> <br>This plague came upon them through the Holy One blessed be He, Moses, and Aaron, as both Moses and Aaron took the soot of the furnace, and Moses threw it heavenward, and the Holy One blessed be He transformed it into boils above, and it fell upon them. <br><b>“It will become dust over the entire land of Egypt, and will be boils erupting into blisters upon man and upon animal, throughout the land of Egypt” (Exodus 9:9).</b> <br>“It will become dust over the entire land of Egypt” – why did He bring boils upon them? It is because they tasked Israel to heat hot water for them and to cool cold water for them;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites prepared water for them to bathe.</i> therefore they were afflicted with boils so they would be unable to touch their bodies. <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A great miracle was performed with the boils, as when a person shoots an arrow upward it does not travel one hundred cubits, and Moses threw a handful of the soot of a furnace, which lacks substance, and Moses threw it heavenward and it reached the Throne of Glory. Another miracle was performed with the boils, that what Moses’s hand held was two handfuls. Another miracle was performed with the boils: When a person scatters a <i>kav </i>of dust, it scatters only four cubits, but Moses took a handful<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">A handful is considerably less than a <i>kav</i>. </i> and scattered it throughout the land of Egypt.
<b>“They took soot of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it heavenward; and it became boils erupting into blisters upon man and upon beast” (Exodus 9:10).</b> <br>“They took soot of the furnace…erupting [<i>pore’aḥ</i>]…upon man and upon beast” – what is <i>pore’aḥ</i>? It is that they were afflicted with leprosy along with it, as it is stated: “If the leprosy will erupt [<i>paro’aḥ tifraḥ</i>] [in the skin]” (Leviticus 13:12).<b> <br>“The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, as the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians” (Exodus 9:11).</b> <br>“The magicians could not…” – why could they not stand before Moses? It is because they counseled Pharaoh to cast every son that is born into the Nile, so that Moses would die.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:24. </i> Moreover, they condemned him to death because he removed the crown from Pharaoh’s head and placed it on his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:26. </i> Therefore, “the magicians could not [stand before Moses because of the boils, as the boils were upon the magicians].” <br><b>“The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not heed them; as the Lord had spoken to Moses” (Exodus 9:12).</b> <br>“The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh” – when the Holy One blessed be He saw that he did not relent from the first five plagues, from that point on, the Holy One blessed be He said: Even if he wishes to repent, I will harden his heart so that I may exact his entire punishment against him; “as the Lord had spoken to Moses” – as it is written: “But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart” (Exodus 7:3).

Chapter 12

<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him: So said the Lord, God of the Hebrews: Let My people go, and they will serve Me. For this time, I will send all My plagues against your heart and upon your servants and against your people, so that you will know that there is none like Me on the entire earth” (Exodus 9:13-14).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Rise early in the morning” – that is what is written: “Behold [<i>hen</i>], God is exalted in His power, who teaches like Him?” (Job 36:22). Rabbi Berekhya said: <i>Hen </i>means one, as in the Greek language, one is called <i>hen</i>. In other words, our God is one. “Exalted in his power” – He increases the strength of the righteous to perform His will. And “who teaches like Him?” – as He teaches the path of repentance. So you find with Moses, whom the Holy One blessed be He strengthened to go on His mission and perform His commands. He taught the wicked Pharaoh to repent because He did not want to send the plague until he forewarns him to [allow him to] repent, as it is written: “Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh.” He would give Moses strength to rise early and stand before Pharaoh, and he taught the wicked Pharaoh about the path of repentance, as it is written: “And say to him: So said the Lord, God of the Hebrews…. For this time…” <br>“Why isn’t it stated here “behold, he is going out to the water” (Exodus 8:16)?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This was the previous place where Moses was instructed to “rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh.”</i> Once Pharaoh saw that when he would go out to the water, Moses would precede him on the path, he refrained and did not go out, so that Moses would not encounter him. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Go to him early, before he leaves his house. <br><b>“For I could have now extended My hand and afflicted you and your people with pestilence, and you would be eliminated from the earth” (Exodus 9:15).</b> <br>“For this time (Exodus 9:14)…For I could have now extended My hand…” The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Woe, wicked one, do you believe that I am unable to eradicate you from the world? Learn from the plague of pestilence. When I sent that pestilence, had I sent it upon you and on your people, you would have been eradicated from the land. However, I only sent it upon you in order to show you the power of My might, and so that you would tell of My strength throughout the land.’ That is what is written: “However, for this I have sustained you [in order to show you My power, and so that My renown will be told of throughout the earth]” (Exodus 9:16). <br><b>“You continue to oppress My people, not letting them go” (Exodus 9:17).</b> <br>“You continue to oppress [<i>mistolel</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>mistolel</i> is obscure. The midrash understands it to be derived from the root <i>s-l-l</i>, and thus it means literally to cause to be crushed, i.e., in the manner that a road is levelled. Others understand it to be derived from the root <i>s-l-s-l</i>, with <i>mistolel </i>therefore meaning “exalt oneself.”</i> My people.” He would make them like a road [<i>mesila</i>] on which everyone treads, as you say: “…who said to your soul: Bow down, so we may pass, and set down your body like the ground” (Isaiah 51:23).
<b>“Behold, I will rain down tomorrow at this time very severe hail, that there has not been like it in Egypt since the day it was founded until now” (Exodus 9:18).</b> <br>“Behold…tomorrow at this time…very severe hail.” Zavdi ben Levi said: He scratched a mark on the wall. He said to him: ‘When the sun reaches here, the hail will fall tomorrow.’ “That there has not been like it in Egypt” – to tell you that there had not been like it in the world and not in Egypt. It does not say that there will not be like it, like it said about the plague of the firstborn: “Nor will be like it any more” (Exodus 11:6). “That there has not been like it” – in other words, in the past there has not been, but there is destined to be in the future. When? In the days of Gog and Magog; that is what is written: “Which I have reserved for a time of trouble, for a day of battle and war”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The previous verse concludes with a mention of storehouses of hail.</i> (Job 38:23), and so it says: “Torrential rain and hailstones” (Ezekiel 38:22). <br><b>“Now, send and gather your livestock and everything that is yours in the field; every man and animal that will be found in the field and will not be gathered into the house, the hail will fall upon them and they will die” (Exodus 9:12).</b> <br>“Now send, and gather your livestock” – come and see the mercy of the Holy One blessed be He; even at the time of His anger, He had mercy on the wicked and on their animals, as He did not send the plague of hail upon them, but only on the crops of the land. He cautioned them that they preserve themselves and their animals, so they would not be stricken with the hail. <br><b>He who feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh drove his servants and his livestock into the houses. And he who disregarded the word of the Lord, he left his servants and his livestock in the field (Exodus 9:20-21).</b> <br>“He who feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh.” Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: That was Job; “and he who disregarded,” that was Pharaoh, and his people.
<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand toward the heavens, and there will be hail throughout the land of Egypt, upon man, upon animal, and upon all the grasses of the field, in the land of Egypt (Exodus 9:22).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand toward the heavens” – that is what is written: “Whatever the Lord wished, He has done…” (Psalms 135:6). David said: Even though the Holy One blessed be He decreed: “The heavens are the heavens of the Lord and the earth He has given to the children of men” (Psalms 115:16) [it is to be understood in this way]. To what is this matter comparable? It is [comparable] to a king who decreed and said that Romans may not go down to Syria and Syrians may not go up to Rome. Similarly, when the Holy One blessed be He created the world, He decreed and said: “The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth He has given to the children of men.” When He sought to give the Torah, He cancelled the first decree and said: Those below will ascend to those above, and those above will descend to those below, and it is I who begins, as it is stated: “The Lord descended onto Mount Sinai” (Exodus 19:20), and it is written: “To Moses He said: Ascend to God” (Exodus 24:1). That is: “Whatever the Lord wished, He has done, in the heavens and on the earth.” <br>Likewise, when He sought to , He said: “Let the waters be gathered” (Genesis 1:9), and when He sought to act, He made the dry land into sea and the depths, as it is stated: “Who summons the water of the sea” (Amos 5:8; 9:6), and it says: “All the fountains of the great deep burst” (Genesis 7:11). When He sought to do so, he made the sea and the depths into dry land, as it is stated: “And the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:29), and it says: “He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness” (Psalms 106:9). Likewise in Egypt, regarding Moses, who was on the land, He gave him license to control the actions of the heavens, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand toward the heavens…” <br>Why did He bring hail upon them? It is because they [the Egyptians] set Israel to be planters of vineyards, gardens, orchards, and trees; therefore He brought hail upon them and broke everything. “Upon man, upon animal” – when the Holy One blessed be He saw that they did not heed His words that He had said to them: “Now send, gather [your livestock…every man and animal that will be found in the field… will die]” (Exodus 9:19), the Holy One blessed be He said: They deserve that the hail shall fall upon everything.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since they did not listen to God’s warning. </i>
<b>“Moses extended his staff toward the heavens and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the ground, and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt” (Exodus 9:23).</b> <br>“Moses extended his staff toward the heavens.” These plagues – three by Aaron, three by Moses, three by the Holy One blessed be He, and one by means of all of them. Blood, frogs, and lice, which were on the earth, were by Aaron. Hail, locusts, and darkness, by Moses, because they were in the air, as Moses had control over the earth and the heavens. Swarms, pestilence, and the plague of the firstborn by the Holy One blessed be He. And boils were by all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">See above, <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 11:5.</i> <br>“And the Lord [<i>vaY-H-V-H</i>] sent thunder and hail.” Every place that <i>vaY-H-V-H </i>is stated, it is He and His heavenly court, as it is stated: “And the Lord [<i>vaY-H-V-H</i>] remembered Sarah” (Genesis 21:1), He and His advisory council. And the Lord [<i>vaY-H-V-H</i>] sent thunder and hail, He and His advisory council. <br>“And fire ran down to the ground.” They were sentenced to the judgment of the wicked in Gehenna. If he was sitting, he was burned by the hail;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">There was“fire flaming within the hail” (Exodus 9:24).</i> if he was standing, he was burned by the fire. <br><b>“There was hail, and fire flaming within the hail, very severe, that there had not been in Egypt since it became a nation” (Exodus 9:24).</b> <br>“There was hail, and fire flaming within the hail” – a miracle within a miracle. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, one said: Like the seed of a pomegranate, whose pit can be seen from the outside; and one said: Like that lantern in which water and oil are mixed as one, and the fire burns within. To what is this matter comparable? To two hardened legions that were fighting each other. Eventually, the time arrived for the king’s war, and the king made peace between them, and they performed the king’s mission together. Fire and hail are hostile to each other, but when the time for the war with Egypt arrived, the Holy One blessed be He made peace between them and they struck Egypt. That is: “There was hail, and fire flaming [<i>mitlakaḥat</i>] within the hail.” What is <i>mitlakaḥat</i>? It means “to take the dead [<i>met lakaḥat</i>].” After the hail would strike him, the fire would take him and burn him. <br><b>“The hail struck throughout the land of Egypt, everything that was in the fields, both man and animal; and the hail struck all the vegetation in the fields, and broke every tree of the fields” (Exodus 9:25).</b> <br>“The hail struck throughout the land of Egypt.” The hail fell and it was arranged in piles surrounding their livestock, so they were unable to go out. An Egyptian would come with a knife and slaughter [one of] them and a bird would descend upon it from above and eat it, as it is stated: “He consigned [<i>vayasger</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Vayasger</i> can also mean to hand over to be imprisoned. </i> their cattle to the hail, and their livestock to fiery bolts [<i>lareshafim</i>]” (Psalms 78:48). What is “and their livestock <i>lareshafim</i>? These are birds, as it is stated: “As the sparks [<i>uvnei reshef</i>] fly upward” (Job 5:7). <br>“And the hail struck all the vegetation in the fields, and broke every tree of the fields” <in <i>Midrash</i> <i>Tehilim.</i>> “He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost [<i>baḥanamal</i>]” (Psalms 78:47). Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Shalom said: What is <i>baḥanamal</i>? It came [<i>ba</i>], rested [<i>ḥana</i>], cut [<i>mal</i>]. Rabbi Pinḥas said: It would descend like an axe and would hew the trees. <br><b>“Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail” (Exodus 9:26).</b> <br>“Only in the land of Goshen” – why was it spared? It is because its patron protected it; that is what is written: “Where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.”
<b>“Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them: I have sinned this time; the Lord is the righteous one, and I and my people are the wicked ones” (Exodus 9:27).</b> <br>“Pharaoh sent” – what he said: “I have sinned this time; the Lord is the righteous one [<i>hatzaddik</i>], and I and my people are the wicked ones.” Because the Holy One blessed be He had said to him: “Now send, gather [your livestock…every man and animal that will be found in the field…will die]” (Exodus 9:19). He [God] acted righteously [<i>tzedaka</i>] with them by warning them, “and I and my people are the wicked ones,” as they disregarded the word of the Lord and left their people and their livestock in the field and they all died. <br><b>Entreat the Lord; there has been enough of this mighty thundering and hail, and I will let you go, and you will stay no longer. Moses said to him: As I leave the city, I will spread my hands to the Lord; the thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail; so that you will know that the earth is the Lord's (Exodus 9:28-29).</b> <br>“Entreat the Lord… Moses said to him: As I leave the city, I will spread my hands…” From here [we learn] that Moses did not want to pray in Egypt because it was filthy with idols and abominations. <br><b>“And as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the Lord God” (Exodus 9:30).</b> <br>“And as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the Lord God.” Do not think that I do not know what you are destined to do afterward. Rather, I know that you will not fear the Omnipresent afterward, just as you did not fear Him beforehand. Yet, I will do so [stop the hail], so you will acknowledge the greatness of the Holy One blessed be He.
<b>The flax and the barley were stricken, as the barley was ripe, and the flax was in stalk. But the wheat and the spelt were not stricken; for they ripen late (Exodus 9:31–32).</b> <br>“The flax and the barley were stricken, as the barley was ripe, and the flax was in stalk. But the wheat and the spelt were not stricken; for they ripen late [<i>afilot hena</i>].” Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom, Rabbi Pinḥas said: What is <i>afilot hena</i>? The Holy One blessed be He performed wonders [<i>pela’im</i>] with them.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The hail should have destroyed them, but God miraculously spared them.</i> Rabbi Yehuda says: They were late [to ripen].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Wheat and spelt ripen later than barley and flax. At the time of the hail the stalks of the former were still green and not fully grown and therefore less vulnerable to the hail. </i> Rabbi Pinḥas said to him: But isn’t it written: “And the hail struck all the vegetation of the field” (Exodus 9:25), and you say that [it was] because they were small and were not stricken? Rather, the Holy One blessed be He performed wonders with them.
<b>“Moses emerged from the city, from Pharaoh, and spread his hands to the Lord; the thundering and hail ceased, and the rain did not pour upon the earth” (Exodus 9:33).</b> <br>“Moses emerged from the city, from Pharaoh” – he was still in the vicinity of the city; he did not delay praying on their behalf, but rather, he immediately “spread his hands to the Lord,” and the Holy One blessed be He accepted his prayer. <br>“The thundering and hail ceased, and the rain did not pour upon the earth.” He suspended it [the hail] loosely. When did it fall? In the days of Joshua, upon the Emorites, as it is stated: “It was as they fled…the Lord cast upon them great stones from the heavens” (Joshua 10:11). The rest is destined to fall in the days of Gog and Magog. <br><b>“Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thundering had ceased, and he continued to sin, and he hardened his heart, he and his servants” (Exodus 9:34).</b> <br>“Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thundering had ceased, and he continued to sin.” The wicked are thus – as long as they are in distress, they subjugate themselves; when the distress passes, they return to their corruption. Likewise Nebuchadnezzar, when he was in distress, he would laud the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise, extol, and honor the King of the heavens, as all His works are truth…” (Daniel 4:34). When he saw himself in his greatness, he began boasting: “The king spoke, and said: Isn’t this great Babylon, which I have built as a royal residence, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?” (Daniel 4:27). Pharaoh, too, did the same: “Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thundering had ceased, and he continued to sin…”

<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Come to Pharaoh, as I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, in order to place these signs of Mine in their midst” (Exodus 10:1).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Come to Pharaoh” – that is what is written: “The heft of a stone and the weight of sand, but the anger of a fool is heavier than both” (Proverbs 27:3). Avnimos the weaver asked our Rabbis, of blessed memory; he said to them: ‘The earth, how was it created initially?’ They said to him: ‘No one is expert in these matters, but go to Abba Yosef the builder.’ He went and found him standing on scaffolding. He said to him: ‘I have a question to ask you.’ He said to him: ‘I cannot descend because I am a day laborer,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">And my time is not my own. </i> but ask what you want to ask.’ He asked: ‘How was the earth created initially?’ He said to him: ‘The Holy One blessed be He took dirt from beneath the Throne of Glory and cast it on the water, and it became earth. The small pebbles that were in the dirt became mountains and hills, as it is stated: “When the dirt turns into a mass, and the clods cleave together”’ (Job 38:38). <br>This is clear in the ears of people,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It is readily understood.</i> as it is stated: “The heft of a stone and the weight of sand.” What is “the heft of a stone”? One who sees the mountains and the hills, does he not say: How did the Holy One blessed be He create these? What is “the weight of sand”? The sand upon which the water stands from above, and it is under it and bears it. The Holy One blessed be He says: It appears heavy in the eyes of people, and they view it as though it is wearying for Me, but it is not wearying, as it is stated: “He does not tire and does not weary” (Isaiah 40:28). What wearies Me? One who angers me with idle chatter, as it is stated: “You wearied the Lord with your words” (Malachi 2:17). That is “but the anger of a fool is heavier than both.” <br>Another interpretation: “The heft [<i>koved</i>] of a stone” – the Holy One blessed be He said: I honored [<i>kibadti</i>] Israel, who are called stone, as it is stated: “From the Shepherd of the stone of Israel” (Genesis 49:24). “The weight [<i>netel</i>] of sand” – this is Israel, who were analogized to sand, as it is stated: “The number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea” (Hosea 2:1), and I have elevated them in the world, and I said: One who touches them touches the pupil of his eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the verse in Zechariah (2:12): “One who touches you touches the pupil of his eye.” </i> Rabbi Yehoshua says: It is a textual emendation; “My eye” is written.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The verse means to say: “One who touches you touches the pupil of My eye,” but out of respect for God, the verse was phrased “his eye.” </i> They arose and angered Me and I sought to eliminate them and to cast them from before Me, but I said [I will not destroy them,] so that Pharaoh the wicked will not say: He was unable to deliver them so he stood against them and killed them. That is “but the anger of a fool is heavier than both.” That is “as I have hardened his heart.”
Another interpretation: “As I have hardened his heart” – that is what is written: “I said I will eliminate them [<i>afeihem</i>]” (Deuteronomy 32:26). What is <i>afeihem</i>? I said in my wrath [<i>be’api</i>]: Where are they [<i>ayeh hem</i>]? Alternatively: <i>Afeihem</i> – I said in My wrath [<i>be’af</i>] that they angered Me: Where are they [<i>ayeh hem</i>]? They will be nothing other than: “I will cease their memory from man” (Deuteronomy 32:26). Who caused them to emerge from there? “Were it not that I dreaded the enemy's provocation” (Deuteronomy 32:27).
Another interpretation: “As I have hardened his heart” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From here there is an opening for the heretics to say that he had no [opportunity] to repent, as it is stated: “As I have hardened his heart.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said to him: Let the mouths of the heretics be sealed; rather, “to the scorners He scorns” (Proverbs 3:34). The Holy One blessed be He forewarns a person the first time, the second, and the third, and if he does not relent, He locks his heart from repentance in order to exact retribution for his sins. The same is true regarding the wicked Pharaoh. Once the Holy One blessed be He sent [him warnings] five times, and he disregarded His words, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: You were stubborn and hardened your heart; behold. I will add impurity to your impurity. That is: “As I have hardened [<i>hikhbadti</i>] his heart.” What is <i>hikhbadti</i>? The Holy One blessed be He rendered his heart like this liver, which, when it is cooked twice, becomes hard. Thus, Pharaoh’s heart became like that liver, and he did not accept the words of the Holy One, blessed be He. That is: “As I have hardened his heart.”
<b>“And so that you will relate in the ears of your son, and of your son's son, what I have wrought upon Egypt, and My signs that I have performed among them; and you will know that I am the Lord” (Exodus 10:2).</b> <br>“And so that you will relate in the ears of your son” – the Holy One blessed be He revealed to Moses what plague He would bring upon them, and Moses wrote it in an allusion: “And so that you will relate in the ears of your son” – this is the plague of locusts, as it is stated: “Relate to your children about it” (Joel 1:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">What is to be related appears in the following verse – locusts.</i> <br><b>“Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and said to him: So said the Lord, God of the Hebrews: How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me?

For if you refuse to let My people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your border” (Exodus 10:3–4).</b> <br>“Moses and Aaron came.… For if you refuse to let My people go…” – what is “behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your border”? But not in the borders of the descendants of Ḥam. In this regard it is stated: “For when Your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants [of the world] learn righteousness” (Isaiah 26:9). Through the plague of locusts, they recognized until where the border of Egypt is. <br><b>“And your houses will be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; that neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen, from the day that they were on the earth until this day. He turned, and exited from Pharaoh” (Exodus 10:6).</b> <br>“They will cover the face of the earth.… And your houses will be filled…He turned, and exited from Pharaoh” (Exodus 10:5–6) – what is this?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Why does the Torah state that “he turned, and exited”? That does not appear in the account of any other plague. </i> It is because he saw that they were looking at each other and believing his words, and he left there so they would take counsel and repent.
<b>“He said to them: So let the Lord be with you, when I will let you and your children go; see that evil is facing you” (Exodus 10:10).</b> <br>“Pharaoh's servants said.… Moses and Aaron were returned.… Moses said: We will go with our young and with our old.… He said to them: So let the Lord be with you…” (Exodus 10:7–10) – what is “evil facing you”? He said to them: ‘It is the way of youths and elders to sacrifice, but the young and the children? One who says this, his intention is only to flee, not as you are saying: “A three-day journey” (Exodus 5:3, 8:23). Therefore, see that what you are thinking, that you intend to flee, will return against you, so you will not depart from here.’ <br><b>“Not so; let the men go now and serve the Lord; for that is what you seek. He drove them out from Pharaoh's presence” (Exodus 10:11).</b> <br>That is what is written: “Let the men go now” – he said to him: ‘If you say: Our intent is not to flee, prove your assertion: “Let the men go now.” Since the children are not fit to serve, why do you need them? Rather, “for that is what you seek” – you are seeking to perform evil, you wish to flee. Therefore, I will not listen to you at all.’ Immediately, he issued a command and drove them from there; that is what is written: “He drove them out from Pharaoh's presence.”
<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, and they will ascend on the land of Egypt, and eat every grass of the land, everything that the hail left” (Exodus 10:12).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand” – why did He bring locusts upon them? It is because they tasked Israel to be sowers of wheat and barley; therefore, he brought locusts upon them, and they ate everything that the Israelites had sown. <br><b>“Moses extended his staff over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; it was morning, and the east wind brought the locusts” (Exodus 10:13).</b> <br>“Moses extended his staff” – why would the Holy One blessed be He give a time for the plagues, “tomorrow” (Exodus 10:4), and not bring them upon them immediately? It was so they would relent and repent. <br><b>Pharaoh hastened to call Moses and Aaron, and he said: I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you (Exodus 10:16).</b> <br>“The locusts ascended…they covered the surface of the entire land… Pharaoh hastened to call Moses and Aaron…” (Exodus 10:14–16) – what is “I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you”? “I have sinned against the Lord your God,” in that I did not let Israel go, “and against you,” in that I drove you out from before me and I thought to curse you, as I said: “So let the Lord be with you” (Exodus 10:10). “Now, please, forgive my sin [just this once, and entreat the Lord your God, and He will remove this death only from me].… He exited from Pharaoh” (Exodus 10:17–18).
<b>“The Lord turned an exceedingly strong west wind, and it carried the locusts, and deposited them into the Red Sea; there did not remain even one locust within the entire border of Egypt. The Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go” (Exodus 10:19–20).</b> <br>“The Lord turned…a west wind…there did not remain even one locust” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the locusts came, the Egyptians rejoiced. They said: Let us fill barrels with them. The Holy One blessed be He said: Wicked ones, are you rejoicing over the plague that I brought upon you? Immediately, “the Lord turned an exceedingly strong west [<i>yam</i>] wind”; this is the west [<i>maaravit</i>] wind. “It carried the locusts…” – what is “there did not remain even one locust”? Even what was salted in the pots and in the barrels flew and went away. “The Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">It is possible that this last line expresses that once Pharaoh saw that even the locusts in the barrels disappeared, he concluded that the plague had been the result of sorcery, as this would not have happened with real locusts. Consequently, he hardened his heart (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i>

Chapter 14

<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand toward the heavens, and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt, and the darkness will be tangible” (Exodus 10:21).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand toward the heavens.” That is what is written: “He sent darkness, and it was dark; and they did not defy [<i>maru</i>] His word” (Psalms 105:28). Our Rabbis said: It is because they did not accept the authority [<i>marut</i>] of the word of the Holy One blessed be He over them. Alternatively, the Holy One blessed be He said to the angels: ‘The Egyptians deserve to be afflicted with darkness,’ and they all immediately agreed as one, and did not defy. What is: “He sent darkness, and it was dark”? To what is this matter similar? It is similar to a master whose servant sinned against him. He said to someone: ‘Go and strike him fifty beatings.’ He went and struck him one hundred beatings, adding some of his own. So, the exalted Holy One blessed be He sent darkness upon the Egyptians, and the darkness added on its own; that is: “He sent darkness, and it was dark [<i>vayaḥshikh</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This could be translated as “and it made it dark.” </i> <br>“And the darkness will be tangible.” What were the dimensions of the darkness? Our Rabbis said: It was as thick as a dinar,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A coin.</i> as it is stated: “And the darkness will be tangible [<i>veyamesh</i>],” that it had substance [<i>mamash</i>].
<b>“Moses extended his hand toward the heavens, and there was a thick darkness in the entire land of Egypt for three days. They did not see one another, and no one rose from his place for three days; but for all the children of Israel there was light in their dwellings” (Exodus 10:22-23).</b> <br>“Moses extended his hand toward the heavens, and there was a thick darkness.” From where did this darkness come? Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: From the heavenly darkness, as it is stated: “He made darkness His secret place, His pavilion around Him” (Psalms 18:12). Rabbi Neḥemya said: From the darkness of Gehenna, as it is stated: “A land of darkness, like blackness, the shadow of death<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Gehenna.</i> and disorder, [where the light is like darkness]” (Job 10:22). Woe to a house whose windows open into darkness, as it is stated: “Where the light is like darkness.” And so it says: “On the day he descended to the grave I caused the deep to mourn [<i>he’evalti</i>], and cover itself for him” (Ezekiel 31:15), <i>hovalti<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Because mourning has little to do with depths, the midrash interprets the word<i> he’evalti</i> as <i>hovalti</i>, meaning: I led him into the depths. </i> </i>is written. <br>Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi said: With what are the wicked covered in Gehenna? With darkness. Ḥizkiyya said: This tub, with what does one cover it? With an earthenware vessel, with the same substance; just as it is of earthenware, so too, one covers it with an earthenware vessel. The same is true of the wicked, as it is stated: “Their deeds are in the dark” (Isaiah 29:15); therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, covers them with the depths, which is dark, as it is stated: “And darkness on the surface of the depths” (Genesis 1:2). One may [therefore] say: The darkness that came upon Egypt was from within Gehenna.
Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, blessed is His name, before whom there is no favoritism and who examines the innermost thoughts and feelings, bring darkness upon them? It is because there were sinners among the Israelites who had Egyptian patrons, had wealth and honor, and did not want to leave. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: If I bring a plague upon them publicly and they die, the Egyptians will say: Just as it<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The plague of the firstborn</i> befell us, so it befell them. Therefore, He brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days so they<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites</i> could bury their dead and their enemies would not see them, and they would praise the Holy One, blessed be He, for it. <br>What is thick darkness? Rabbi Avdimi of Haifa said: It was darkness many times over.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">It was exceptionally dark.</i> Our Rabbis said: There were seven days of darkness. How so? The first three days, one who was sitting and sought to stand, stood, and one who was standing and sought to sit, sat. Regarding those days, it is stated: “There was a thick darkness in the entire land of Egypt three days. They did not see one another.” Three other days, one who was sitting was unable to stand, one who was standing was unable to sit, and one who was crouching was unable to straighten up. In their regard it is stated: “and no one rose from his place three days.” <br>[Through the events that transpired] during the three days of thick darkness,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">At the conclusion of the three days of thick darkness, the Israelites would ask the Egyptians to borrow the items.</i> the Holy One, blessed be He, granted the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians and they lent them. For [during these days] Israelites would enter the houses of Egyptians, and would see in them silver vessels, gold vessels, and garments. [When the Egyptians were asked to lend these items,] if they would say: ‘We do not have anything to give you,” the Israelites would say to them: ‘Behold, it is in such and such place.’ At that moment, the Egyptians would say: Had they sought to deceive us, they would have taken them during the days of darkness and we would not have sensed it, as they had already seen them. Since they did not touch them without our knowledge, likewise, they will not keep them. They lent to them, in fulfillment of what is stated: “Then they will emerge with great property” (Genesis 15:14). That is what is written: “But for all the children of Israel there was light…” It is not stated [that there was light] in the land of Goshen, but rather “in their dwellings,” as everywhere that a Jew would enter, light would enter and illuminate for him what was in the barrels, the boxes, and the treasure chests. And in their regard it is stated: “Your word is a lamp to my feet [and a light to my path]” (Psalms 119:105). <br>These are six days of darkness that were in Egypt. The seventh [day] of darkness was the day of darkness at the sea, as it is stated: “There was the cloud and the darkness and it illuminated the night” (Exodus 14:20). So, the Holy One, blessed be He, dispatched a cloud and darkness and darkened for Egypt and illuminated for Israel, as He had done in Egypt, and in this regard it is stated: “The Lord in my light and my salvation” (Psalms 27:1). Likewise, in the future, the Holy One, blessed be He, will bring darkness, as it is stated: “For, behold, darkness will cover the earth…” (Isaiah 60:2).
“Pharaoh summoned Moses and said: Go serve the Lord, only let your flocks and your herds remain; even your children will go with you. Moses said: You, too, will give into our hand feast offerings and burnt offerings, and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God” (Exodus 10:24-25).</b> <br>“Pharaoh summoned Moses, and said: Go serve the Lord…Moses said: You, too, will give into our hand feast offerings and burnt offerings.” Moses said to him: ‘Do not think that we will sacrifice anything of ours; rather, you, too, will give into our hand feast offerings and burnt offerings that we will sacrifice to the Holy One blessed be He in your name.’ “Our livestock, too, will go with us” (Exodus 10:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">You will give us animals for immediate sacrifice on your behalf, and we will take our livestock for the purpose of any additional offerings.</i> <br><b>“Pharaoh said to him: Go from me, beware, do not see my face anymore, the moment you look upon my face you shall die. Moses said: You have spoken well; I will not see your face anymore” (Exodus 10:28-29).</b> <br>“Pharaoh said to him: Go…. Moses said: You have spoken well.” You have projected the truth, as “I will not see your face anymore,” as the Holy One blessed be He said to me as you have said.

Chapter 15

<b>“The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying: This month shall be for you the first of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you” (Exodus 12:1–2).</b> <br>“The Lord spoke to Moses.… This month shall be for you the first of months” – that is what is written: “The voice of my beloved, behold, he is coming” (Song of Songs 2:8),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In standard editions of <i>Shemot Rabba</i>, there is an obscure reference inserted here into the text. There are in fact similar <i>midrashim</i> to what follows in<i> Pesikta deRav Kahana, Pesikta Rabbati</i>, and <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba</i>. </i> as it is stated: “My beloved spoke and said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10): ‘What are you doing here in the place of the impure, “whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses”’ (Ezekiel 23:20)? “Rise up, my love, my fair one, and go” (Song of Songs 2:10). He [Moses] said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, You said that we would be enslaved four hundred years,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to Genesis 15:13, where God informs Abraham that his descendants will be slaves in a land not theirs for four hundred years.</i> but they have not yet been completed.’ He said to him: ‘They have already been completed, as it is stated: “For behold, the winter has passed”’ (Song of Songs 2:11); immediately, the righteous uncovered their heads, which had been covered,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">They were covered as a sign of mourning.</i> as it is stated: “The blossoms have appeared in the land” (Song of Songs 2:12) – these are the [members of the] tribe of Levi, all of whom were righteous. <br>Alternatively, “the blossoms [<i>hanitzanim</i>]” – these are the priests, “the sons of Aaron, Elazar his son, Pinḥas his son” (I Chronicles 6:35).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the High Priests, who wear the sacred diadem [<i>tzitz</i>].</i> <br>Alternatively, “the blossoms” – these are the kings: David, Solomon, Reḥavam, Asa, Aviya. <br>Alternatively, these are the Levites: “Asaf the leader and his deputy Zekharia” (I Chronicles 16:5). Once the Holy One blessed be He saw that it was so, He said: “The time of the songbird has come” (Song of Songs 2:12) – the time has arrived for the Levites to recite songs and psalms before Me. <br>Another matter: “The time of the songbird has come” – when the Holy One blessed be He heard Israel reciting the song,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., the Song of the Sea, Exodus 15:1–18. Alternatively, the psalms said while eating the paschal lamb.</i> He said: “The sound of the turtledove is heard in our land” (Song of Songs 2:12) – that He heard the voice of Israel due to the merit of Abraham, who sacrificed a turtledove and a young pigeon.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 15:9–10.</i> What is written thereafter? “The fig tree has formed its unripe figs” (Song of Songs 2:13) – these are the righteous and the upright. “The vines in blossom give scent” (Song of Songs 2:13) – these are the middling who repented. From that point on: “Arise my love, my fair one, and go” (Song of Songs 2:13). When the children of Israel left Egypt, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘You have no other month that is greater than this one; it is therefore called first, as it is stated: “The first of months.”’ <br>Another interpretation: “It shall be the first [month of the year] for you” – as it were, the Holy One blessed be He is called first, as it is stated: “I am first and I am last” (Isaiah 44:6). Zion is called first, as it is stated: “Throne of glory, exalted from the first, the place of our Temple” (Jeremiah 17:12). Esau is called first, as it is stated: “The first emerged…” (Genesis 25:25). The messiah is called first, as it is stated: “The first to Zion, behold they are here” (Isaiah 41:27). May the Holy One blessed be He, who is called first, come and build the Temple that is called first, and exact retribution from Esau, who is called first; and let the messiah, who is called first, come during the first month, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you the first of months…”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – the ministering angels said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, when are You going to set the festivals, as it is written: “The matter came about by the decree of the messengers, [the question by the word of the holy ones]?”’ (Daniel 4:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">“The messengers” and “the holy ones” are the angels.</i> He said to them: ‘I and you will ratify what Israel decides and [how they] intercalate the year, as it is stated: “I call to God Most High, to God who completes for me” (Psalms 57:3), and so it says: “These are the festivals of the Lord [that you shall proclaim them] holy convocations…”’ (Leviticus 23:37). You [shall proclaim them], whether at the proper time or not at the proper time; I have no festivals other than these. The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘In the past, it was in My hands, as it is stated: “He made the moon for the festivals…” (Psalms 104:19),<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish calendar is lunar, and the beginning of the months is determined by the new moon.</i> but from here onward, it is given into your hands and is your prerogative; if you say yes, yes, if you say no, no. In any case, “this month shall be for you.” Moreover, if you seek to intercalate the year I will confirm it for you.’ That is why it is written: “This month shall be for you.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – that is what is written: “These are the two anointed ones, who stand by the Lord of all the land” (Zechariah 4:14). Rabbi Levi said: This teaches that the Holy One blessed be He was continuously seeking something to redeem Israel. He was unable to find anything until He found the merit of Moses and Aaron, which stood for them; that is what is written: “These are the two anointed ones [<i>benei yitzhar</i>].” To what is this matter comparable? To a king who sought to marry a woman, and they came to him and said: She is poor and has nothing in the world other than two nose rings. So, the Holy One blessed be He said: It is sufficient for Israel to be redeemed due to the merit of Moses and Aaron. That is why it is stated: “The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron.”
Another interpretation: “The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron” – that is what is written: “The voice of my beloved, behold, he is coming” (Song of Songs 2:8). When Moses went and said to Israel: ‘So said the Holy One blessed be He to me: “Today you are leaving, in the month of spring”’ (Exodus 13:4), they said to him: ‘Where is He?’ He said to them: ‘He is about to arrive: “The voice of my beloved, behold, he is coming, [leaping upon the heights, bounding upon the hills]”’ (Song of Songs 2:8). Rabbi Yehuda said: What is “leaping upon the heights?” The Holy One blessed be He said: If I scrutinize the actions of Israel they will never be redeemed. Rather, at whom will I look? At their saintly forefathers, as it is stated: “Moreover, I have heard the cry of the children of Israel…[and I have remembered my covenant]” (Exodus 6:5)<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The covenant was made with the patriarchs.</i> – on the merit of their forefathers I am redeeming them. Therefore, it is written: “Leaping upon the heights,” and heights mean nothing other than the forefathers, as it is stated: “Hear, O heights, the Lord’s grievance [and the mighty ones, foundations of the earth]” (Micah 6:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i> Eitanim, </i>meaning mighty ones, is a term that the Sages used for the patriarchs.</i> <br>Another interpretation: Rabbi Neḥemya said: What is “leaping upon the heights?” [It is not to be understood literally.] Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said: Israel does not have deeds that would warrant their being redeemed, except by the merit of the elders, as it is stated: “Go, and gather the elders of Israel” (Exodus 3:16), and heights are nothing other than the elders, as Yiftaḥ’s daughter says to her father: “I will go down in the heights” (Judges 11:37). Was she going to the heights? Rather, she was saying: To the elders, as she was going to show the elders that she was a pure virgin.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">She therefore did not deserve the fate decreed for her by her father’s vow.</i> That is why it is written: “Leaping upon the heights.” <br>Another interpretation: Rabbi Elazar said: What is “leaping upon the heights”? The Holy One blessed be He said: I arranged for Esau that he would establish kings, as it is stated: “These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom” (Genesis 36:31). If I allow Esau to establish more kings, how will Israel survive? Rather, I will supplant them and render them chieftains, as it is stated: “These are the chieftains of the sons of Esau” (Genesis 36:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is reading the verses out of chronological order, as if the chieftains came after the kings.</i> Heights mean nothing other than idolaters, as it is stated: “Behold, four chariots<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The chariots represent four idolatrous nations.</i> are emerging from between the two heights” (Zechariah 6:1).
<b>“The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying” (Exodus 12:1).</b> <br>“In the land of Egypt” – why does it not say: “In Egypt”? Rabbi Ḥanina said: The Holy One blessed be He said: It is written in the Torah: “You shall stand outside” (Deuteronomy 24:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The debt collector must stand outside and cannot enter the debtor’s house to seize his property.</i> I, too, will do so – “in the land of Egypt,” but not in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., within the borders but not in the population centers.</i> Likewise, Moses said: “As I leave the city” (Exodus 9:29). <br>Rabbi Shimon said: Great is the love for Israel, as the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself in a place of idol worship, a place of filth, and a place of impurity in order to redeem them. This is analogous to a priest whose <i>teruma</i> fell into a cemetery. He says: What shall I do? To impurify myself is impossible, and to leave my <i>teruma </i>there<i> </i>is impossible. It is preferable that I render myself impure one time and then purify myself, and [thus] I will not lose my <i>teruma</i>. So, our ancestors were the <i>teruma </i>of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Israel is holy to the Lord, [the first of His crop]” (Jeremiah 2:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teruma</i> is also described as the first of a crop (see Deuteronomy 18:4).</i> They were among the graves, as it is stated: “As there was no house in which there were none dead” (Exodus 12:30), and it says: “And Egypt was burying [those whom the Lord had smote]” (Numbers 33:4). The Holy One blessed be He said: How do I redeem them? To leave them there is impossible. It is preferable to come down and redeem them, as it is stated: “I came down to deliver them from the hand of Egypt” (Exodus 3:8). When He took them out, He summoned Aaron, and he purified Him, as it is stated: “He shall atone for the Holy of Holies [<i>mikdash hakodesh</i>]” (Leviticus 16:33), “He shall atone for the Sanctuary [<i>hakodesh</i>]” (Leviticus 16:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hakodesh</i> is homiletically understood to refer to the Source of sanctity.</i>
<b>“This month shall be for you the first of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you” (Exodus 12:2).</b> <br>Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – that is what is written: “Who is she who appears like the dawn [<i>shaḥar</i>], [beautiful as the moon, pure as the sun, fearsome as banners of a host?]” (Song of Songs 6:10). There are four terms of praise of Israel here, corresponding to the four exiles. For during the four exiles that Israel experienced, they did not deny the Holy One blessed be He. In the Babylonian exile, from where [can this be seen]? It is as it is stated: “Who is she who appears like the dawn?” Nebuchadnezzar prostrated himself to the sun, as it is stated: “How have you fallen from the heavens, glowing morning [<i>shaḥar</i>] star” (Isaiah 14:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">“Morning star” refers to Nebuchadnezzar.</i> Daniel<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel lived during the Babylonian exile.</i> would rise early [<i>shoḥer</i>] and pray to the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “And windows were open for him in his upper chamber facing Jerusalem” (Daniel 6:11), evening, morning, and noon. Why would he rise early and pray? It was so the Holy One blessed be He would have mercy upon Israel. In his regard, Solomon said: “He who seeks [<i>shoḥer</i>] good seeks favor” (Proverbs 11:27). God was present for them in their time of distress, as it is stated: “I love those who love me…” (Proverbs 8:17). <br>Likewise, we find, when Daniel was cast into the lions’ den, he was not harmed, as it is stated; “God sent His angel and closed the lions’ mouths, and they did not harm me” (Daniel 6:23). Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya were cast into the fiery furnace and were not harmed, as it is stated: “The hair of their heads was not singed [. . .] and the odor of fire did not cover them” (Daniel 3:27). Rather, they illuminated the world like the dawn, which illuminates the world. Therefore, “who appears like the dawn.” They caused the idolaters to acknowledge the Holy One blessed be He and to praise Him, as Nebuchadnezzar said when Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya emerged from the furnace: “Blessed is the God of Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Aved Nego” (Daniel 3:28),<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">These are the Babylonian names of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya.</i> “the servants of the exalted God” (Daniel 3:26). Likewise, Darius said after Daniel fell into the lions’ den “to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, who is the living God” (Daniel 6:27); therefore, it is written: “Who is she who appears like the dawn?” <br>“Beautiful as the moon” (Song of Songs 6:10) – in the Median [Persian] exile; you find during the night that if the moon is not seen in the sky, there is darkness in the world, and a person is unable to walk, even in the city. When the moon is seen in the sky, everyone is glad, and they walk on the road. So, during the days of Aḥashverosh, when they decreed against the Jews to “destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13), and Esther came and illuminated for Israel, as it is stated: “The Jews had light and gladness, [and joy and honor]” (Esther 8:16); that is why it is written: “Beautiful as the moon,” about the Median exile. If your wish is to know why Esther was likened to the moon: Just as the moon is reborn after thirty days, so too, Esther said: “But I have not been summoned to the king these thirty days” (Esther 4:11); that is why “beautiful as the moon” is in the Median exile. <br>“Pure as the sun” (Song of Songs 6:10) – during the Greek kingdom. <i>Sandrios eim Ulios</i>:<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is in corrupted Greek, and two interpretations of it have been given. (1) The Sanhedrin against the sun, i.e., the Jewish Sanhedrin stands in opposition to the Greeks, represented by the sun (Mirkin); and (2) Alexander, son of Helios, i.e., Alexander the original Macedonian emperor, is the son of the god of the sun, Helios (Jastrow).</i> The sun [<i>ḥama</i>] is its name, and the sun is called a strong man [<i>gibor</i>], as it is stated: “Rejoices as a strong man [<i>gibor</i>] to run its course” (Psalms 19:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is referring to the movement of the sun on its course.</i> During the summer, who can withstand the sun; everyone flees from it, as it is stated: “And nothing hides from its heat [<i>meḥamato</i>]” (Psalms 19:7). So, with regard to the Greek kingdom, everyone fled from it, and Matitya the priest and his sons were steadfast in their faith in the Holy One blessed be He, and the troops of Greece fled from before them and were all killed. So, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: “Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears; the weak will say: I am mighty [<i>gibor</i>]” (Joel 4:10). And it says: “So may all Your enemies perish, Lord…” (Judges 5:31), to fulfill what is stated: “Pure as the sun.” <br>“Fearsome as banners” (Song of Songs 6:10) – in [reference to the hegemony of] Edom [Rome]; why is it [Israel] called fearsome? It is because it remains steadfast in a kingdom that inspires fear, as it is stated: “And behold a fourth beast, dreadful and fearsome, and strong” (Daniel 7:7). What is “fearsome as banners?” You find that there are twelve constellations in the sky. Just as the heavens cannot endure without the twelve constellations, so, the world cannot endure without the twelve tribes, as it is stated: “If [these] statutes depart [from before Me, says the Lord, then the descendants of Israel will also cease from being a nation before Me forever]” (Jeremiah 31:35). <br>“Fearsome as banners” – banners are nothing other than armies, as it is stated: “The banner of the camp…and their host and their numbered” (Numbers 2:3–4). Likewise, the banners of the heavens are the angels, and the banners of the earth are Israel. The hosts of the heavens are angels, as it is stated: “And the entire host of the heavens standing…” (II Chronicles 18:18). The hosts of the earth are Israel, as it is stated: “All the hosts of the Lord emerged from the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:41). The Master of them both is the Holy One blessed be He. Just as everyone fears the Holy One blessed be He and the angels, so too, the idolaters fear Israel, as it is stated: “And all the peoples of the land will see that the name of the Lord [is called upon you, and they will fear you]” (Deuteronomy 28:10). This is why it is stated: “Fearsome as banners,” because the Holy One blessed be He likened Israel to the angels. <br>Regarding angels it is stated: “Seraphim were standing above Him” (Isaiah 6:2), and regarding Israel it is stated: “You are standing today” (Deuteronomy 29:9). The angels say each day: “Holy, holy, holy [is the Lord of hosts]” (Isaiah 6:3), and Israel says: The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">At the beginning of the <i>Amida</i> prayer. Both the angels and Israel praise God with a threefold prayer.</i> Angels are called fire, as it is written: “The flaming fire His servants” (Psalms 104:4), and Israel likewise, as it is written: “The house of Jacob will be fire” (Obadiah 1:18). Angels are renewed every morning, and praise the Holy One blessed be He and then return to the river of fire from which they emerged; and the Holy One blessed be He again renews them and restores them as they had been initially, as it is stated: “They are new every morning” (Lamentations 3:23). So, [the people of] Israel sink into iniquities due to the evil inclination that is in their bodies, and they repent. Each year, God forgives their iniquities and renews their hearts to fear Him, as it is stated: “I will give you a new heart” (Ezekiel 36:26). That is why it is written: “Fearsome as banners.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you [the first [<i>rosh</i>] of months]” – what is written in this passage: “You shall take a bunch of hyssop…the Lord will pass to smite Egypt” (Exodus 12:22–23)? That is what is written: “For from the top [<i>rosh</i>] of the rocks I see him” (Numbers 23:9) – these are the patriarchs, as it is stated: “Hear, O heights, the Lord’s grievance” (Micah 6:2). We find that the Omnipresent initially sought to establish the world, but was unsuccessful until the patriarchs arose. This is analogous to a king who was seeking to build a city. He issued a decree, and they searched for a place to build the city. He came to lay the foundation, and water was rising from the depths and did not allow him to lay the foundation. He sought to lay the foundation again in a different place, and the water would overturn it. [He kept looking] until he came to a certain place and found there an enormous rock. He said: Here, I will establish the city, upon these rocks. So was the world originally only water mixed with water. God sought to establish worlds, but the [presence of the] wicked did not allow it. What is written regarding the generation of Enosh? “Then invoking the name of the Lord began” (Genesis 4:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This is an unconventional reading of the verse. The verse is usually understood as a positive assertion of the beginning of religious life. The midrash, following <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 23:7, reads it as negative, as the beginning of human disrespect for the Divine.</i> Water rose and inundated them, as it is stated: “Who made <i>Ash</i>, <i>Kesil</i> and <i>Kima</i>…” (Job 9:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">These are usually identified as the constellations Ursa Major, Orion, and the Pleiades. This is perhaps based on the legend that God caused the Flood by removing two stars from the constellation of Pleiades and stopped the rain by taking two stars from Ursa to replace them (<i>Berakhot</i> 59a). Alternatively, the text should be emended to say just <i>Kima</i> and <i>Kesil</i>, and the reference is to Amos 5:8 where the verse refers to flooding: “He made <i>Kima </i>and<i> Kesil</i>…calls the waters of the sea and pours them upon the face of the earth; the Lord is His name.”</i> Likewise, the generation of the Flood was wicked; what is written about them? “Who say to God: Leave us” (Job 22:17). The water rose and did not enable them to lay a foundation upon it, as it is stated: “Their foundation poured like a river” (Job 22:16). And it is written: “On that day, all the fountains of the great depths were breached” (Genesis 7:11). When the patriarchs came and exhibited merit, the Holy One blessed be He said: Upon these I will establish the world, as it is stated: “For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and He set the world upon them” (I Samuel 2:8). That is why it is written: “For from the top of the rocks I see him.” <br>“Behold [<i>hen</i>], a people that will dwell alone” (Numbers 23:9) – what is <i>hen</i> [<i>heh nun</i>]? All the letters can be paired other than these two. How so? <i>Alef tet </i>are ten; <i>bet ḥet</i> are ten; <i>gimmel zayin</i> are ten; <i>dalet vav </i>are ten; <i>heh </i>remains by itself.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Each letter has a numerical value, in order: <i>alef</i> = 1, <i>bet</i> = 2, etc. From <i>yod</i>, they are multiples of ten: <i>yod</i> = 10, <i>kaf</i> = 20, etc. The last four letters of the alphabet are multiples of one hundred: <i>kof</i> = 100, <i>resh</i> = 200, etc. </i> Likewise, the letter <i>nun</i> does not have a pairing; <i>yod tzadi </i>are one hundred; <i>kaf peh</i> are one hundred; <i>lamed ayin </i>are one hundred; <i>mem samekh</i> are one hundred; <i>nun </i>remains by itself. The Holy One blessed be He said: Just as these letters cannot be paired with other letters, but are by themselves, so too, Israel cannot cleave to all the ancient worshippers of stars and constellations; rather, they are by themselves. Even when an enemy decrees against them to desecrate Shabbat, to abolish circumcision, or to worship idols, they are killed and do not assimilate among them, as it is stated: “Behold, a people that will dwell alone and will not be reckoned among the nations” (Numbers 23:9). <br>And what do I do to every foe or enemy that will makes a decree against them? I will kill him, as it is stated: “Behold, a people that will rise like a lion” (Numbers 23:24). From here you learn: You find that Amalek came upon them and they killed them, as it is stated: “Joshua weakened Amalek and his people by sword” (Exodus 17:13). Sisera came and they killed him, as it is stated: “The Lord confounded Sisera” (Judges 4:15), and likewise all their enemies. Likewise, when Israel emerged from Egypt, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: “And you shall not emerge [each from the entrance of his house until morning]” (Exodus 12:22). They were in their houses, and He was killing their enemies, as it is stated: “And the Lord will pass to smite Egypt” (Exodus 12:23) – that is what is written: “Behold, a people that will rise like a lion.” That is why the Holy One blessed be He said: Since I performed miracles for you during this month, you too shall render it the first month, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you the first of months.”
It is analogous to a king who had a son whom he placed in charge of all his property. The son said to his father: ‘If you do not give me your throne, how will everyone know that you are fond of me? Only if you give to me the place of your throne will everyone show appreciation for me.’ Thus God gave Abraham the world, as it is stated: “And the Lord said: Will I conceal [something] from Abraham” (Genesis 18:17). Once He gave him everything, he said to Him: If You do not give me the Temple, five hundred cubits by five hundred cubits, You have not given me anything. The Holy One blessed be He gave him everything that he asked, as it is stated: “And I have given you one portion more than your brothers” (Genesis 48:22). When Abraham heard this, what did he say? “God spoke in His holiness, I exulted” (Psalms 60:8).
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you the first of months” – it is analogous to a king to whom a son was born, and he made a celebration. The son was taken captive and was there [in captivity] for a long time. After that time, the son was redeemed, and the king made a birthday celebration<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The day of his redemption was celebrated like a new birthday.</i> for him. So, until Israel descended to Egypt, they would count toward the enslavement.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">God had told Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land for four hundred years and that they would be enslaved there (see Genesis 15:13).</i> Once they went down and were enslaved there, and the Holy One blessed be He performed miracles on their behalf and they were redeemed, they began counting the months, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you the first of months.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – that is what is written: “[He brought out His people with joy and his chosen ones with gladness.] He gave them lands…so that they would observe His statutes” (Psalms 105:43–45). God brought the plagues upon the Egyptians: “He sent darkness, and it was dark” (Psalms 105:28); He gradually lowered [the darkness] until it reached Egypt. “Egypt rejoiced at their departure” (Psalms 105:38) – it is analogous to a king whom everyone honored. To what degree did they honor him? To the extent that they would bring him gifts and would present their gods with them. So, Pharaoh ruled from one end of the world to the other end, and they would bring him gifts and present their gods with them. Then Moses and Aaron came, as it is stated: “Then Moses and Aaron came…” (Exodus 5:1). He took out his lists<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Lists of the names of all the gods.</i> and searched them but did not find this [God’s] name.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 5:2: “Pharaoh said: Who is the Lord, that I should heed His voice to send forth Israel? I do not know the Lord, and I also will not send forth Israel.”</i> This is analogous to a servant who was walking with his master…as cited above.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shemot Rabba </i>5:14</i> <br>But the Holy One blessed be He is living and everlasting, as it is stated: “But the Lord God is the true God, He is the living God, and the eternal King” (Jeremiah 10:10). It is analogous to a poor person who was in the city and stood before the king [to ask for assistance], but he was indifferent [to the poor person’s suffering]. When the affliction affected his own body he said: There is nothing like this. So, the Holy One blessed be He brought plagues upon the Egyptians, but Pharaoh was indifferent. When it afflicted his body, he was affected and began screaming: “The Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked” (Exodus 9:27). <br>Could the Holy One blessed be He not have rescued Israel from the hand of Egypt with the first plague? Rather, it was to fulfill what is stated: “He exalts the nations and eliminates them” (Job 12:23), and it is written: “He removes the heart of the leaders of the people of the land” (Job 12:24). Why did he say: “The Lord is righteous?” When the plagues came, they came only in the land of Egypt. Even if a plague was introduced there and entered like [the size of] an almond, the plague would fill all of it but would not touch another field [outside of Egypt]. About this it is stated: “For when Your judgments are on the earth, [the inhabitants of the world] learn righteousness” (Isaiah 26:9). To what was the congregation of Israel comparable? To a king who had a beloved daughter, who was located across the river; the king extended his hand and brought her over and seated her in his chariot, as it is stated: “How beautiful are your steps” (Song of Songs 7:2); “I did not know myself; he placed me on the chariots of my noble people” (Song of Songs 6:12); “He rained meat upon them like dust” (Psalms 78:27); “He led them through the depths” (Psalms 106:9); “the Lord was going before them by day” (Exodus 13:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">All these verses express ways that God expresses his care for Israel.</i> All this was due to the merit of Abraham, as it is stated: “For He remembered His holy word unto Abraham His servant; He took out His people with gladness…and He gave them the lands of the nations” (Psalms 105:42–44). Why? “So they would observe His statutes and keep His laws” (Psalms 105:45).
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – that is what is written: “Happy is the nation that the Lord is its God” (Psalms 33:12). When the Holy One blessed be He chose [to create] His world, He set in it months and years. When He chose Jacob and His descendants, He set the beginnings of the months of redemption, during which Israel would be redeemed from Egypt and during which they are destined to be redeemed, as it is stated: “Like the days of your departure from the land of Egypt, I will show it wonders” (Micah 7:15). In it [the month of redemption], Isaac was born and was bound, and in it Jacob received the blessings. In it, He intimated to Israel that it is the beginning of salvation for them, as it is stated: “It shall be the first month of the year for you.” It is analogous to a king who got his son out of prison, and he said: Establish it as a festival for always, since on it [that day] my son emerged from darkness to light, from an iron yoke to life [as a free man], from slavery to freedom, from enslavement to redemption. So did the Holy One blessed be He take Israel out of prison, as it is stated: “He takes out prisoners from chains” (Psalms 68:7). From darkness and the shadow of death, as it is stated: “He took them from darkness and the shadow of death” (Psalms 107:14); from an iron yoke to the yoke of Torah, from slavery to freedom, as it is stated: “You are children to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1); from enslavement to redemption, as it is stated: “Their Redeemer is strong, the Lord of hosts is His name” (Jeremiah 50:34). Therefore, He assigned it [the month] for them to rejoice that He exacted retribution against their enemies on their behalf, as it is stated: “I will give men in your stead” (Isaiah 43:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Those who mistreated you will be mistreated instead of you.</i>
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – Rabbi Meir says: The redemption is for Me and for you. As it were, I was redeemed with you, as it is stated: “Whom You redeemed from Egypt, the nation and its God” (II Samuel 7:23). Establish this month for Me and for you, as I will see the blood of the paschal offering and it will atone for you, as it is stated: “Speak to the entire congregation of Israel […they shall take for them each man a lamb…a lamb for each household” (Exodus 12:3) – and your rejoicing will be complete, even for one who is poor. <br><b>“An unblemished lamb, a male in the first year, from the sheep or from the goats you shall take it. You shall hold it in safekeeping until the fourteenth day of this month; and the entire assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon” (Exodus 12:5–6).</b> <br>“An unblemished lamb, a male in the first year” – “a lamb,” corresponding to: “God will see to the lamb for Him…” (Genesis 22:8);<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This is Abraham’s response to Isaac when asked where the lamb was for the sacrifice.</i> “unblemished [<i>tamim</i>],” corresponding to: “The Rock, His actions are perfect [<i>tamim</i>]” (Deuteronomy 32:4); “a male,” as He killed all the firstborn of Egypt and spared the firstborn of Israel. “From the sheep or from the goats you shall take it” – just as I kill man and animal, the captive and the maidservant, so do you have license to take from any place that you wish, and should guard it [the lamb], and it shall be for you a great festivity <alternative text: safekeeping>, as it is stated: “You shall hold it in safekeeping.” “Shall slaughter it” – you slaughter the paschal offering and I slaughter the firstborn. <br><b>“They shall take of the blood and place it on the two doorposts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they will eat it. They shall eat the meat on that night, roasted with fire; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it” (Exodus 12:7–8).</b> <br>“They shall take of the blood and place it on the two doorposts” – as I will pass over you and protect you. You shall be careful with it, as it is eaten [only] at night, as it is stated: “They shall eat the meat on that night, roasted with fire,” corresponding to Abraham, whom I rescued from the fiery furnace.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">See Bereshit Rabba 38:5.</i> “And unleavened bread” – corresponding to Sarah, who prepared loaves for the ministering angels, but they did not taste the bread (see Genesis 18:6). “Bitter herbs,” corresponding to Jacob; just as his descendants were pursued in Egypt, so did Esau pursue him. <br><b>“You shall not leave any of it until morning; and what remains of it until morning you shall burn in fire” (Exodus 12:10).</b> <br>“You shall not leave any of it until morning” – just as I will not leave any soul of the Egyptian firstborn, so, “you shall not leave any of it until morning.” It is analogous to a king who told his sons: Know that I judge capital cases and convict [the guilty]. Offer a gift to me, so that if you come before my tribunal I will transfer [<i>aavir</i>] your verdict to others. So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: I am dealing in capital cases, and I hereby inform you how I can spare you with mercy – with the blood of the paschal offering and the blood of circumcision; and I will grant atonement to your souls, as the passage [<i>haavara</i>] that I will make is severe, as it is stated: “I will pass in the land of Egypt [on that night]” (Exodus 12:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues: “And I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to animal; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments; I am the Lord.”</i> Likewise, Israel says: “The Lord also will be a haven for the oppressed, a haven for times of trouble” (Psalms 9:10).
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – Solomon said: “Through me kings reign” (Proverbs 8:15). Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a duke to whom the legions cast a purple cloak [of royalty]. What did he do? He cancels tax debts, burns the promissory note, and brings out the legions [on parade or on leave], and that is called the beginning of his reign. So did the Holy One blessed be He reign for twenty-six generations<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Since Creation.</i> in Egypt, and then He cancelled the debt, as it is stated: “And the children of Israel went out triumphantly” (Exodus 14:8); He burned the promissory note, as it is stated: “The residence of the children of Israel that they lived in Egypt [was four hundred and thirty years]” (Exodus 12:40);<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">In fact, God took them out of Egypt after only two hundred and ten years.</i> He took out the legions, and it was called the beginning of His reign, to realize what is stated: “Through me kings reign.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – that is what is written: “I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you” (Micah 6:4). That is what Scripture states: “Send Your light [<i>orekha</i>] and Your truth [<i>amitekha</i>]; they will lead me” (Psalms 43:3) – that is Moses and Aaron, as it is stated: “To Levi He said: Your Tumim [<i>tumekha</i>] and Your Urim [<i>ve’urekha</i>]” (Deuteronomy 33:8),<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Urim and the Tumim, which were oracular talismans that were part of the vestments of the High Priest, can be literally translated as ‘lights and virtues,’ which is close to the light and truth of the verse in Psalms.</i> and it is written: “The Torah of truth was in his mouth” (Malachi 2:6). <br>“I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you” (Micah 6:4) – this teaches that he [Moses] was not seeking to redeem Israel; rather, Moses said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘“Who am I [that I should go]?” (Exodus 3:11). Is this what You promised to their ancestors, that You would take out their descendants by means of flesh and blood? “Who am I that I should go?” “And that I should take the children of Israel out” (Exodus 3:11) – is it about me that it is written: “I will judge” (Genesis 15:14), that You are sending me to deliver them? Did You not promise Abraham and say to him: “And also that nation whom they will serve, I will judge” (Genesis 15:14)? Did You not say to Jacob: “I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will surely take you up” (Genesis 46:4), and You say to me [to do it]? “Who am I?”’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘By your life, I will go down and deliver them. One woman went down to Egypt, and for her sake, I went down and rescued her. When? It was when Pharaoh abducted Sarah, as it is stated: “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh” (Genesis 12:17). If, for the sake of one woman I came down, for six hundred thousand men, six hundred thousand women, and six hundred thousand children will I not come down and deliver them? Rather, you go first and inform My children that I am redeeming them and then I will deliver them.’ That is why it is written: “Send Your light and Your truth; they will lead me.” That is why He said: “I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – that is what is written: “He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron whom He had chosen” (Psalms 105:26). When the Holy One blessed be He entered, as it were, He afflicted all their firstborn and their gods, as it is stated: “I afflicted Egypt” (Joshua 24:5), and likewise: “Upon their gods the Lord administered judgments” (Numbers 33:4). When He afflicted them with the plague of the firstborn, what did they do? They took their sons and concealed them in their temples of idol worship. Rabbi Berekhya said: The Egyptians were seeking and searching how to escape the plague but could not find [a way]. Why? It is as it is stated: “And the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape is lost from them” (Job 11:20). “The wicked” – these are the Egyptians, as it is stated: “And I and my people are wicked” (Exodus 9:27). What caused them to be afflicted by each plague? It was because they put their trust in their false gods. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He smote their gods with them. Those that were made of wood rotted; [those] of stone dissolved; [those] of silver and of gold, He melted them into what they were originally, as it is stated: “Upon their gods the Lord administered judgments” (Numbers 33:4). <br>All the idols in the world were eliminated except for their Baal Tzefon. Why? It was in order to mislead them; that is why it is written: “He exalts the nations and eliminates them” (Job 12:23). Likewise, Isaiah says: “Who makes a way in the sea.… Who takes out chariot and horse, army and a mighty force” (Isaiah 43:16–17). When Israel departed from Egypt, the Holy One blessed be He said: “That they should return and encamp before Pi Haḥirot” (Exodus 14:2). “Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel: They are confused in the land; [the wilderness has closed in [<i>sagar</i>] on them]” (Exodus 14:3). He called all his armies and said to them: ‘Do you not know that Baal Tzefon has gathered all the lions in the wilderness against Israel, similar to the matter that is stated: “He sent an angel and closed [<i>usegar</i>] the mouth of the lions”’ (Daniel 6:23). Immediately, the angel of Egypt came down to eliminate them [the Israelites], as it is stated: “Behold, Egypt was traveling after them” (Exodus 14:10). It is not stated: Pharaoh traveling after them, but rather, “Egypt” – that is their angel. Immediately, [the Israelites] “were very frightened” (Exodus 14:10). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: “Do not fear” (Exodus 14:13). <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Extend your hand over the sea” (Exodus 14:26). Immediately, “Moses extended his hand” (Exodus 14:27). “Egypt was fleeing toward it [the sea]” (Exodus 14:27) – it should have said: Egypt was fleeing from it. Is there a person who flees from an entity and flees toward it? Rather, the Holy One blessed be He misled them, and they could not find where to flee, and they were fleeing toward it until the depths were reestablished, as it is stated: “The Lord tossed Egypt in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:27), while the Divine Spirit was crying: “And the eyes of the wicked will fail and escape is lost from them” (Job 11:20). Regarding Baal Tzefon, upon which they relied, it is stated: “And their hope will turn into despair” (Job 11:20). So, in the future, when all the idolaters will enter [for judgment], bringing their false gods with them to rescue them, as it is stated: “For all the peoples will walk, each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God, for ever and ever” (Micah 4:5). When they come, what does the Holy One blessed be He do with them [the idols]? He melts them. And they see and are embarrassed, and they cast them away, and they go and conceal themselves in caves and among the boulders. <br>Likewise, Isaiah says: “For it is a day for the Lord of hosts against everyone proud and lofty” (Isaiah 2:12) – these are their priests. “The false gods shall utterly pass away” (Isaiah 2:18) – what will they [the priests of the false gods] do? They will go and conceal themselves, as it is stated: “They will come into caves of rocks, and into tunnels of dirt” (Isaiah 2:19). And it is written: On that day a person will cast away the idols of his silver and the idols of his gold” (Isaiah 2:20). The Holy One blessed be He will say to them: ‘Are you fleeing? Look what I have caused to be written: “Though they hide themselves on top of Carmel, I will search from there” (Amos 9:3). Ḥiel, who concealed himself for the Baal on Mount Carmel and [attempted] to ignite the wood, did not I smite him?<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">According to a midrash, when Elijah challenged the priests of the Baal on Mount Carmel (I Kings, chap. 18), Ḥiel hid in order to kindle the Baal’s sacrifice surreptitiously and was bitten by a snake. See addendum to <i>Devarim Rabba</i> (Lieberman).</i> “Though they hide from before My eyes…[from there I will command the serpent and it will bite them]” (Amos 9:3). And it says: “If they dig into the grave, [from there My hand will take them, and if they ascend heavenward, from there will I take them down]”’ (Amos 9:2). At that moment: “And the eyes of the wicked will fail” (Job 11:20). But regarding the righteous it says: “The name of the Lord is a tower of strength” (Proverbs 18:10).
Another interpretation: “The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying” (Exodus 12:1) – what is the Holy One blessed be He doing in Egypt? It is for the sake of Israel. Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: This is analogous to a noblewoman who provoked the king. The king put her in prison and went with her and was with her in prison. People said to him: ‘Why do you care?’ He said to them: ‘All the time that I am with her, she will not acquire a bad name.’ So, Israel was enslaved in Egypt, and the Holy One blessed be He, as it were, was exiled with them, as it is stated: “I will go down with you to Egypt” (Genesis 46:4). Similarly with [the exile to] Babylonia, it is stated: “For your sakes, I sent [<i>shilaḥti</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Masoretic text has <i>shilaḥti</i> but the midrash reads it <i>shulaḥti</i>, I was sent. </i> to Babylon” (Isaiah 43:14). Likewise, with [the hegemony of] Media, as it is stated: “I will place My throne in Elam” (Jeremiah 49:38), and Elam is nothing other than Media, as it is stated: “Go up, Elam; besiege, Media” (Isaiah 21:2). With the [hegemony of] Greece, the Holy One blessed be He was with them, as it is stated: “[I will rouse your children, Zion, against your children, Greece, and will set you like the sword of a mighty man.] The Lord will be seen over them, and His arrow will emerge like lightning” (Zechariah 9:13–14). <br>They [the angels] said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Why all this?’ He said to them: ‘All the time that I am with them, they will not acquire a bad name. I was with them in Egypt, and they were found whole, as it is stated: “A locked garden, my sister, my bride” (Song of Songs 4:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">They were not corrupted by the surrounding licentiousness.</i> I was with them in Babylon, and they were found whole, as it is stated: “Behold our God whom we serve [is able to deliver us]” (Daniel 3:17). I was with them in Media and they were found whole, as it is stated: “Mordecai would not bow and would not prostrate himself” (Esther 3:2). In Greece, they refused to write on the horn of an ox that they have no portion in the God of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is relating to a tradition that the Greek-speaking rulers decreed that they must do so. See <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> 2:4. </i> With regard to Edom [Rome], if the Holy One blessed be He says yes, who will say no, as it is stated: “Who is this, coming from Edom” (Isaiah 63:1).’<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">This is the beginning of a prophecy about the destruction of Edom.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is analogous to a wealthy man who went out during the summer. People said that he was at the threshing floor. What did he do? He came in with a branch of a grapevine, so that everyone would know that he had come from the vineyard. So, the idolaters said to Israel: Where is your God? As it is stated: “Where is their God” (Deuteronomy 32:37). “Now, hear this, pampered one, who sits securely…” (Isaiah 47:8)<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This verse refers to the idolaters.</i> – what is the Holy One blessed be He destined to do to them? “I will make My arrows drunk with blood” (Deuteronomy 32:42). Not only that, but He is destined to trample them, as it is stated: “I have trodden a winepress alone” (Isaiah 63:3), and He us destined to tread with His shoe on all the great ones of Edom, as it is stated: “I cast My shoe upon Edom” (Psalms 60:10).
Another interpretation: “…in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:1) – it is analogous to one who found a snake and smashed its head with a rock and cut off its tail; from now on, what good is it? So, the Egyptians arose and enslaved Israel, which is intolerable, and the same is true for Edom. What did the Holy One blessed be He do to Egypt? He exacted retribution against them, as it is stated: “He tossed Pharaoh and his army in the sea” (Psalms 136:15). Regarding Edom it is written: “I have trodden a winepress alone” (Isaiah 63:3). The Divine Spirit said: “Egypt shall be desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness” (Joel 4:19). And the Holy One blessed be He is destined to redeem Israel from Edom. [Israel said to God:] ‘“Jerusalem and Your people have become a disgrace to all our surroundings” (Daniel 9:16), and You are not redeeming us?’ He said to them: ‘Yes’ [I will redeem you]. They said to Him: ‘Swear to us;’ He swore to them that just as He redeemed us from Egypt, so too, He will redeem us from Edom. Moreover, the great ones of the nations will see a lowly one of Israel and desire to bow before them due to the name that is inscribed on each and every one, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, Redeemer of Israel, its Holy One, to the despised person, to the abhorred by nations, to the slave of rulers: Kings will see and stand up, [and princes will prostrate themselves]” (Isaiah 49:7). <br>It is analogous to fine wood that was located in a bathhouse. A high official entered to bathe, he and all his servants, and they trampled the wood, and all the villagers, as well as everyone else, were eager to step on it. After several days, he [the emperor] sent a bust to that city, to [serve as a model to] make a statue of him, but they did not find any [suitable] wood other than what was in the bathhouse. The craftsmen said to the governor: ‘If you wish to set up the statue, bring the wood that is in the bathhouse, as there is none better.’ They brought it and prepared it appropriately and gave it to the sculptor, and he sculpted the image onto it, and he placed it in the palace. The governor came and bowed before it, so did the duke, so did the prefect, so did the provost, so did the legionaries, so did the council, and so did everyone. Those craftsmen said to them: ‘Yesterday, you were trampling this wood in the bathhouse, and now you are prostrating yourselves to it?’ They said to them: ‘We are not bowing to it for its own sake, but to the image of the king that is inscribed on it.’ <br>So do Gog’s men say: Until now we have been doing to Israel what is intolerable, as it is stated: “To the despised person, to the abhorred by nations, [to the slave of rulers: Kings will see and stand up, and princes will prostrate themselves]” (Isaiah 49:7),<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Israel is despised and abhorred.</i> and now we are prostrating ourselves to Israel? The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Yes, it is due to My name that is inscribed on them, as it is stated: “Because of the Lord who is faithful” (Isaiah 49:7).’ So does Moses say: “All the peoples of the earth will see that the name of the Lord is called upon you…” (Deuteronomy 28:10). When the Holy One blessed be He took Israel out of Egypt, He would take the lamp and go before them, as it is stated: “And the Lord was going before them during the day” (Exodus 13:21). So He is destined to do when He takes them out of Edom, and so Isaiah said: “For the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard” (Isaiah 52:12). And it is written: “Behold, the former things have come to pass [and I relate new ones. Before they sprout I will let you hear of them]” (Isaiah 42:9), to fulfill what is written: “Egypt shall be desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness” (Joel 4:19).
Another interpretation: “In the land of Egypt” – for whose sake did the Holy One blessed be He reveal Himself? It was for His own sake. It is analogous to an apprentice who was seized for the sake of his master<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">He was taken to ensure that the master would pay a debt.</i> and confined. His master said to him: ‘Have no fear, I will come and take you out.’ He sent his servant to take him out, but the innkeeper [where he was confined] did not want to let him go. He [the master] said: The innkeeper did well, as I said to him that I would take him out, and I did not tell him that I would send my servant. So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Your descendants are destined to be enslaved in Egypt, and then I will redeem them,’ as it is stated: “Know that your descendants will be strangers [in a land that is not theirs, and they shall be enslaved to them and they shall oppress them, four hundred years]” (Genesis 15:13), and it is written: “Also that nation, whom they will serve, I will judge” (Genesis 15:14). The Holy One blessed be He sent Moses to redeem them, but Pharaoh did not want [to let them go]. The Holy One blessed be He said: Pharaoh acted appropriately, as I said to Abraham: “[Also the nation that they will serve] I will judge.” Is Moses “I”? Is Aaron “I”? I said only: “I am the Lord your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt” (Psalms 81:11).
Another interpretation: For whose sake did the Holy One blessed be He reveal Himself? It was for Moses’s sake. Rabbi Nissim said: It is analogous to a priest who had a fig orchard, and in that orchard there was a grave that had been plowed over.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">A priest is forbidden to become ritually impure through contact with a dead body. In this case, since it is uncertain whether there are bones in the soil, the priest is prohibited from entering the orchard. </i> He wanted to eat figs. He said to someone: ‘Go tell the sharecropper that the owner of the orchard says to you to bring him two figs.’ He went and told him that. The sharecropper replied to him: ‘Who is the owner of the orchard? Go back to work.’ The priest said to him: ‘I will go to the orchard.’ They said to him: ‘You are going to an impure place.’ He said to them: ‘Even if there are one hundred sources of impurity there, I will go, and my emissary will not be disgraced.’ So, when Israel was in Egypt, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Go and I will send you to Pharaoh” (Exodus 3:10). He went, and he [Pharaoh] said to him: “Who is the Lord that I should heed His voice [to let Israel go]? I do not know the Lord” (Exodus 5:2); “go to your burdens” (Exodus 5:4). The Holy One blessed be He said: I will go to Egypt, as it is stated: “A prophecy of Egypt: [Behold, the Lord is riding upon a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt]” (Isaiah 19:1). The ministering angels said to Him: ‘You are going to Egypt, to a place of impurity?’ He said to them: ‘I will go, and My emissary Moses will not be disgraced.’ That is what is written: “The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – why did the Holy One blessed be He say this to Moses and Aaron? It is because sanctification of the month is [done] with three. When the Holy One blessed be He sought to sanctify the month, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses and Aaron: I and [the two of] you will sanctify the month. That is what is written: “The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron.” However, intercalation of the year<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Adding a month to the year to synchronize the lunar calendar with the solar calendar.</i> is done by ten elders. When our Rabbis assembled to intercalate the year, ten expert elders would assemble in the study hall, and the <i>Av Beit Din</i> [the senior member of the court] was among them. They would lock the doors and deliberate over the matter all night. At midnight, they would say to the <i>Av Beit Din</i>: ‘We seek to intercalate the year so that this year will be thirteen months; will you join us in this decree?’ He would say to them: ‘I am with you in your opinion.’ At that moment, light would emerge from the study hall and come before them, and they would know that God has consented to them, as it is stated: “To the upright He shines a light in the darkness” (Psalms 112:4). What they decree, the Holy One blessed be He agrees with them, as it is stated: “I will cry to God Most High, to God who accomplishes it for me” (Psalms 57:3). May the name of the Holy One blessed be He be praised, that creatures decree and He consents, as it is stated: “The righteous rules with the fear of God” (II Samuel 23:3). From where is it derived to convene with ten elders? It is as it is stated: “Wisdom bolsters the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city” (Ecclesiastes 7:19). <br>Likewise, during the reign of Solomon, when Solomon would intercalate the year, he would assemble seven elders before him, as it is stated: “A wise man is lazy in his eyes, more than seven who respond sensibly” (Proverbs 26:16). What is “A wise man is lazy in his eyes?” It is that Solomon would keep his mouth closed, so as not to speak before one who is greater than he, and so it says: “When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider well what is before you” (Proverbs 23:1), and it says: “Put a knife to your throat, if you are a man with self-control” (Proverbs 23:2). Solomon, Natan the prophet, and Gad the seer were there, for a total of ten.
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – that is what is written: “Behold, the former have come to pass and the new I declare” (Isaiah 42:9). Is there anything new in the future? Is it not written: “What was, that is what will be” (Ecclesiastes 1:9)? Rather, we find that there are ten things that the Holy One blessed be He is destined to introduce in the future. <br>The first is that He is destined to illuminate the world, as it is stated: “The sun will no longer be for you for light by day [and the glow of the moon will not illuminate for you; the Lord will be your eternal light and your God will be your glory]” (Isaiah 60:19). Is it possible for a person to gaze at the Holy One blessed be He? Rather, what does the Holy One blessed be He do to the sun? He has it illuminate forty-nine portions of light, as it is stated: “The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold” (Isaiah 30:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash assumes that there is a fixed ratio of 1:7 between the light of the moon and the light of the sun. Therefore, if the light of the moon increases sevenfold and has seven portions of light and the light of the sun is seven times greater than that, the sun has 49 portions of light. </i> Even [for] an ill person, the Holy One blessed be He will command the sun and it will heal, as it is stated: “But for you who fear My name, a sun of righteousness, and healing with its rays will shine” (Malachi 3:20). <br>The second: He will bring spring water out of Jerusalem and heal everyone who has an illness, as it is stated: “Every living creature that swarms, any over whom the rivers will come, will live…” (Ezekiel 47:9). <br>The third: He will make trees produce their fruit every month, and a person will eat from them and will be healed, as it is stated: “Along the river on its bank, on this side and on that side…it will produce new fruit every month, because its waters emerge from the Temple, [and its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing]” (Ezekiel 47:12). <br>The fourth: That they will rebuild all the ruined cities, and there will be never again be places in ruins. Even Sodom and Gomorrah will be rebuilt in the future, as it is stated: “Your sisters Sodom and its daughters will return to their former state” (Ezekiel 16:55). <br>The fifth: That He will build Jerusalem with sapphire stones, as it is stated: “I will set your stones in fair colors” (Isaiah 54:11), and it is written: “I will make your windows of rubies” (Isaiah 54:12). Those stones will shine like the sun, and the idolaters will come and see the glory of Israel, as it is stated: “Nations will walk by your light” (Isaiah 60:3). <br>The sixth: “Cow and bear will graze, [together will their young lie]” (Isaiah 11:7). <br>The seventh: That He will bring all the beasts, all the birds, and all the creeping creatures and make a covenant with them and with all of Israel, as it is stated: “On that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, [and with the creeping creatures of the ground]” (Hosea 2:20). <br>The eighth: That there will no longer be crying and wailing in the world, as it is stated: “The sound of weeping and the sound of crying will no longer be heard in it” (Isaiah 65:19). <br>The ninth: There is no more death in the world, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever; and the Lord God will wipe tears from upon all faces; and the disgrace of His people He will remove” (Isaiah 25:8). <br>The tenth: That there will be no sighing, no groaning, and no despair, but rather, everyone will rejoice, as it is stated: “The redeemed of the Lord will return, and will come to Zion with song [and everlasting joy]” (Isaiah 35:10).
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – that is what is written: “He made the moon for festivals; the sun knows its setting” (Psalms 104:19). There are many [of God’s] deeds that Moses recorded in the Torah that are unclear and David arose and explained them. We find in the act of Creation, that when He created the heavens and the earth, He created light, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created [the heavens and the earth]” (Genesis 1:1), and afterward: “God said: Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3). David explained it: After God created light, He created the heavens, as it is stated: “He covers Himself with light like a garment” (Psalms 104:2), and then, “He stretches the heavens like a curtain” (Psalms 104:2). Here we have learned that after He created light He created the heavens. Three creations preceded the world: Water, air [<i>ruaḥ</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew word <i>ruaḥ</i> can mean air, wind, or spirit. </i> and fire. Water became pregnant and gave birth to darkness. Fire became pregnant and gave birth to light. Air became pregnant and gave birth to wisdom. With these six creations the world is conducted, with spirit, with wisdom, with fire, with light, with darkness, and with water. <br>That is why David said: “May my soul bless the Lord. Lord my God, You are very great” (Psalms 104:1). A person sees a beautiful pillar and says: Blessed is the quarry from which this was quarried. The world is beautiful; blessed is the Omnipresent who quarried it and created it with speech, happy are you O world, that the Holy One blessed be He reigns over you. [A person of] flesh and blood etches [<i>tzar</i>] his image on a wooden tablet, and the tablet is larger than his image. God, may His name be blessed, is great, and His image is great. The world is small, and He is greater than the world, as it is stated: “For the Lord is God, an everlasting Rock [<i>tzur olamim</i>]” (Isaiah 26:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In contrast to an image created by flesh and blood, where the image is necessarily smaller than the object upon which it is drawn, God’s image is greater than the world.</i> What is taught when Scripture states: <i>Tzur olamim</i>? Relative to Him, the two worlds [<i>olamim</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">This world and the World to Come.</i> are considered nothing. That is why it is stated: “Lord my God, You are very great.” <br>After He covered Himself with light, He then created the world, as it is stated: “He covers Himself with light like a garment; [He stretches the heavens like a curtain]” (Psalms 104:2). [A person of] flesh and blood, after he builds the house, he builds the upper story. God is not like that; after He built the roof, He built the upper story, and after He built the upper story, He positioned it on the atmosphere of the world, on nothing. Then He installed His chariots, clouds; and then His dais on the storm. Who informs you about all these matters? It is David, who explained the deeds of God to inform all humanity of His might, as it is stated: “He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters; He makes the clouds His chariot” (Psalms 104:3); not from copper, not from iron, but with balconies of water. Then He constructed the upper stories, not from stone and not from hewed stone, but from layers of water, as it is stated: “He lays the beams of Your upper chambers in the waters.” <br>[A person of] flesh and blood makes his chariot strong to bear his entire burden, and he makes it from iron, bronze, silver, or gold. But God, may His name be blessed, a cloud has no substance, and He makes clouds His chariots, as it is stated: “He makes the clouds His chariot.” Flesh and blood, if there was a muddy path before him, he walks on stones that are hard. But God is not so; rather, He leaves the visible cloud and walks on the invisible wind, as it is stated: “Who walks upon the wings of the wind” (Psalms 104:3). Flesh and blood conscripts strong, powerful soldiers capable of wearing helmets, and armor, and weapons. But the Holy One blessed be He conscripted His soldiers that are invisible, as it is stated: “Who makes winds His messengers” (Psalms 104:4). The wind emerges, followed by lightning, as it is stated: “The flaming fire His servants” (Psalms 104:4). <br>After He created the sky, He created angels on the second day, and on that same day He created Gehenna, as “that it was good,” is not written about it [the second day]. Like [a person of] flesh and blood who acquires slaves and says [to his associates]: ‘Make swords.’ They say to him: ‘Why?’ He says to them: ‘So if they rebel, they will receive a death sentence.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said: I created Gehenna [on the second day], about which “that it was good” is not written, so if people sin, they will descend into it. From where is it derived that Gehenna was created on the second day? It is as the prophet explains: “For Hell has been prepared from yesterday” (Isaiah 30:33), from the day that a person could say yesterday. When would a person be able to say yesterday? It is on the second day, as the first day of the week precedes it. <br>Afterward, He created dry land on the third day, as it is stated: “He established the earth upon its foundations” (Psalms 104:5). At that moment, one was naked and one was clothed, like [a person of] flesh and blood who has two servants; he stripped the garment off of one and clothed the other with it. So, God said: “Let the waters be gathered” (Genesis 1:9) – He exposed the earth and covered the depths. So said David: “You covered the depths as with a garment” (Psalms 104:6). <br>“From Your rebuke they flee” (Psalms 104:7) – like flesh and blood who saw his winepress filled with grapes and a vineyard to harvest. People said to him: ‘Where will you put the rest of the grapes, since the winepress is small?’ He said to them: ‘I will make a winepress that will hold all the grapes in the vineyard.’ What did he do? He trampled the grapes and trod on one [pile] after another, and then brought the grapes that were in the vineyard, and the winepress held all the grapes.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The winepress could not contain all the grapes at once but could contain all the juice. </i> So, the entire world was filled with water, and the earth was immersed in the water. The Holy One blessed be He said: “Let the dry land appear” (Genesis 1:9). The waters said: ‘We fill the world, and until now it is crowded for us; where will we go?’ May His name be blessed, He kicked Ocean and killed it, as it is stated: “With His power, He calmed the sea, and with His understanding, He crushed [<i>maḥatz</i>] Rahav” (Job 26:12). <i>Maḥatz </i>means nothing other than killing, as it is stated: “She crushed [<i>maḥatza</i>] and pierced his temple” (Judges 5:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">This is a description of how Yael killed Sisera.</i> <br>When he killed it, some say that it is crying until today, as it is stated: “Have you entered into the springs of [<i>nivkhei</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash reads <i>nivkhei</i> as though it derives from the term <i>bekhi</i>, weeping.</i> the sea?” (Job 38:16). Why did He kill them? It is because a house that holds one hundred living people holds one thousand dead. That is why Ocean is called the Dead Sea; but the Holy One blessed be He is destined to heal it, as it is stated: “To the sea it will flow, and the water will be healed” (Ezekiel 47:8). When the rest of the waters saw that He kicked Ocean, its fellows fled at the sound of its scream. It is like a donkey driver of flesh and blood who was walking and there were two servants in front of him; [when the donkey driver whips the donkeys], those [servants] in front [of the donkeys] run and flee. So, the rest of the water in the world fled at the sound of the scream of Ocean, as it is stated: “From Your rebuke they flee.” They fled, but they did not know to where they were fleeing, as it is stated: “They rose to the mountains, descended in the valleys, to this place You established for them” (Psalms 104:8). <br>It is like a servant of flesh and blood to whom his master said: ‘Wait for me in the marketplace,’ but did not tell him where to wait. The servant began saying: Perhaps he told me to wait for him near the basilica, perhaps he told me near the bathhouse, or perhaps he told me alongside the platform. He [the master] entered [the city], found him and slapped him. He said to him: ‘I sent you to the gate of the prefect’s palace.’ So, the waters were wandering, when they heard that He said to them: “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place” (Genesis 1:9). He did not say to them to the north or to the south, but rather they scattered, “they rose to the mountains, descended in the valleys.” The Holy One blessed be He slapped them. He said to them: ‘I said to you to go to the place of the leviathan.’ From where that it is so? It is as it is stated: “To this place You established for them” (Psalms 104:8), and that is the place of leviathan, as it is stated: “This leviathan, whom You created to frolic in it [the sea]” (Psalms 104:26). <br>“You set a boundary that they may not cross” (Psalms 104:9). Like flesh and blood that put his animal into a pen and locked the gate before it so it would not go out and graze on the grain. So, the Holy One blessed be He locked the sea with sand and administered an oath to it that it would not go beyond the sand, as it is stated: “That I placed the sand as the boundary of the sea” (Jeremiah 5:22). <br>“Who sends springs through the ravines” (Psalms 104:10) – like [a person of] flesh and blood who has baskets [for the pressing] of olives. He pressed the beam onto them, and the oil came out from above and oil descended below. So, the mountain from this side and the mountain from that side press on the springs and they burst forth and emerge from between the mountains. That is why it is written: “Who sends springs through the ravines.” <br>Afterward, what did David say? “He made the moon for festivals” (Psalms 104:19) – the Holy One blessed be He created three hundred and sixty-five windows in the firmament; one hundred and eighty-three in the east and one hundred and eighty-two in the west; some of them He created for the sun and some of them He created for the moon, so that the world would follow it. The sun goes through all of them, as does the moon except for eleven windows that the moon does not enter any of them. This is like a prefect and a duke who were receiving gifts. The prefect took commensurate with his honor and the duke commensurate with his honor. So, the sun is called great and the moon is called small. This is why the sun is called great, because it is eleven days greater than the moon.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The solar year is roughly eleven days longer than twelve lunar months.</i> This is why He created the moon for the festivals, so that Israel would increase and decrease like the moon [waxes and wanes]. But this [waxing and waning] is not harmful to it [the moon], but it is for the setting of the festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Similarly, though Israel’s fortunes increase and diminish, it will ultimately prevail.</i> All the years are counted by the sun [by the solar calendar], the years of the world and the years of [the lives of] people, and it [the sun] knows the span of every person, how long he saw the sun. All this to say that He created the moon for the festivals? David rose and explained: “He made the moon for the festivals.” They said to David: ‘While we were in Egypt, we received [the consecration of] the month by the moon’; that is what is written: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2).
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – that is what is written: “They will be for you alone, and there is nothing for strangers with you” (Proverbs 5:17). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘I do not caution idolaters against idol worship, but only you, as it is stated: “You shall not make idols for yourself” (Leviticus 26:1). I gave justice only to you, as it is stated: “Hear this, priests, and hearken, house of Israel, and listen, house of the king, as justice is yours” (Hosea 5:1). Righteousness is for you, as it is stated: “It will be righteousness for you” (Deuteronomy 24:13). Mercy is yours, as it is stated: “He will give you mercy and will be merciful to you and increase you” (Deuteronomy 13:18). Sabbatical Years and Jubilee Years are yours, as it is stated: “You shall sanctify the fiftieth year” (Leviticus 25:10), and it says: “It is a jubilee; it shall be holy for you” (Leviticus 25:12). I gave the mitzvot only to you, as it is stated: “It shall be, if you heed My commandments that I command you today” (Deuteronomy 11:13). The tithes and the firstborn are for you, as it is stated: “You shall eat before the Lord your God…the tithe of your grain…[and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock]” (Deuteronomy 14:23). The offerings are for you, as it is stated: “You shall sacrifice upon it your burnt offerings” (Exodus 20:21). Blessings are for you, as it is stated: “May God bless you and keep you” (Numbers 6:24), and likewise, “I will command My blessing for you” (Leviticus 25:21). The Land of Israel is for you, as it is stated: “To give you the land of Canaan” (Leviticus 25:38); and not the Land of Israel alone, but also all the surrounding lands, as it is stated: “Every place on which your foot will tread [I have given to you]…” (Joshua 1:3). I gave the Torah only to you, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good teaching, My Torah…” (Proverbs 4:2). I have given you ritual fringes, as it is stated: “It shall be a fringe for you” (Numbers 15:39). I have given you festival days, as it is stated: “There shall be a holy convocation for you” (Leviticus 23:7). I have given you Yom Kippur, as it is stated: “For it is the Day of Atonement [to provide atonement for you before the Lord your God]” (Leviticus 23:28). <i>Sukka </i>is for you, as it is stated: “Every native resident in Israel [shall dwell in booths [<i>sukkot</i>]]” (Leviticus 23:42). I have given light only to you, as it is stated: “Arise, shine, for your light has arrived” (Isaiah 60:1). I have given the first of the month only to you, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you.” The paschal lamb is for you, as it is stated: “You shall hold it in safekeeping” (Exodus 12:6); that is, “they will be for you alone, and there is nothing for strangers with you”’ (Proverbs 5:17).
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – one who sees the moon, how should he recite the blessing? At the time when Israel was sanctifying the month,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., rather than automatically following astronomical calculations as is done today, each month witnesses would come to the High Court and testify that they had seen the new moon. Based on this testimony, the court would proclaim which day was sanctified as the first of the month. </i> some Rabbis would say: Blessed…who renews months, some of them would say: Who consecrates months, and some of them would say: Who consecrates Israel, since if Israel does not consecrate it, the consecration is nothing. Do not wonder about this, as the Holy One blessed be He consecrated Israel, as it is written: “You shall be holy to Me, as I, the Lord, am holy” (Leviticus 20:26); since they are consecrated to Heaven, what they consecrate is consecrated. <br>If you would like to know, go and learn from the service vessels. Moses consecrated the Tabernacle and all its vessels. Who consecrated them [vessels introduced afterwards]? Could Moses come and consecrate them? Rather, what would they do? The priest would receive a sacred item in it and the vessel would be consecrated, just as Moses consecrated them with blood for the altar, libation wine, or a meal offering. He would pour it into a non-sacred vessel and the non-sacred vessel would be consecrated. If a non-sacred vessel is consecrated when filled with sacred items, all the more so that Israel, who are sacred, may consecrate the month. The Holy One blessed be He said: I am sacred; do I sanctify for Myself? Rather, I sanctify Israel and they sanctify Me. That is why it is written: “You shall be holy to Me” (Leviticus 20:26), “for I am the Lord who sanctifies you” (Leviticus 21:8). And so did David say: “You, enthroned upon the praises of Israel, are holy (Psalms 22:4). When did Israel begin to consecrate the month? It was in Egypt. That is what is written: “This month shall be for you.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – that is what is written: “He declares His word to Jacob” (Psalms 147:19); that [word] is the Torah. “His statutes and His ordinances to Israel” (Psalms 147:19) – these are the consecration of the months in which there are statutes and ordinances. “Statutes” – these are the festivals, on which ordinances are dependent; “His statutes” are nothing other than festivals, as it is stated: “For it is a statute for Israel” (Psalms 81:5). How are ordinances dependent on it [the setting of the festivals]?<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The festivals are fixed by the monthly setting of the calendar by the High Court’s consecration of the New Moon. </i> A person sells a field, a house, or a slave, or borrows or lends to another; if a person wishes to steal from another, he produces a document and the judges examine how he wrote to him and from when he wrote to him this text, from what month, what day of the month. Likewise, the judges examine him and say to the thief: ‘You may not steal from him.’ That is: “His statutes and His ordinances to Israel” – the judges examine the months, as the judges judge on the basis of the months.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The use the date to ascertain whether the document is authentic.</i>
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you [the first of months]” (Exodus 12:2) – that is what is written: “In his days let the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more” (Psalms 72:7). Before the Holy One blessed be He took Israel out of Egypt, He made it known to them by allusion that their royalty would endure for them for thirty generations, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you the first of months.” The month is thirty days, and your royalty will be thirty generations. On the first of Nisan, the moon begins to shine, and it gradually increases its light until the fifteenth day, and its orb becomes full. From fifteen until thirty days, its light wanes, and on the thirtieth it is not seen. So Israel, for fifteen generations from Abraham until Solomon. Abraham began to give light, as it is stated: “Who has risen from the east, righteousness attends his footsteps” (Isaiah 41:2). Isaac came, and he also gave light, as it is stated: “Light is sown for the righteous” (Psalms 97:11). Jacob came and added light, as it is stated: “The light of Israel shall be fire” (Isaiah 10:17). And then Judah, Peretz, Ḥetzron, Ram, Aminadav, Naḥshon, Salmon, Boaz. Oved, Yishai, David. <br>When Solomon came, the orb of the moon became full, as it is stated: “Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king” (I Chronicles 29:23). Can a person sit on the throne of the Holy One blessed be He, of whom it is stated: “His throne was fiery flames” (Daniel 7:9)? Rather, just as the Holy One blessed be He rules from one end of the world to the other end, and He rules over all the kings, as it is stated: “All the kings of the earth shall give thanks to You” (Psalms 138:4), so, Solomon ruled from one end of the world to the other end, as it is stated: “And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon…and each of them brought his gift” (II Chronicles 9:23–24). That is why it is stated: “Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king.” The garb of the Holy One blessed be He is majesty and glory, and He granted Solomon royal majesty, as it is stated: “He bestowed upon him royal majesty” (I Chronicles 29:25). Regarding the throne of the Holy One blessed be He it is written: “As for the likeness of their faces, the face of a man, and the face of a lion […and the face of an ox from the left for the four of them]” (Ezekiel 1:10), and regarding Solomon it is written: “And on the borders that were between the frames were lions, oxen” (I Kings 7:29), and another verse says: “Like the work of the chariot wheel” (I Kings 7:33). No evil touches the throne of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Evil will not reside with You” (Psalms 5:5); regarding Solomon, it is written: “There is neither adversary nor evil occurrence” (I Kings 5:18). The Holy One blessed be He made six heavens, and He sits in the seventh, and regarding the throne of Solomon it is written: “The throne had six steps” (I Kings 10:19), and he sat on the seventh step. <br>The orb of the moon thereby became full, and from there the kings began diminishing: “The son of Solomon, Reḥavam” (I Chronicles 3:10), the son of Reḥavam, Aviya, his son Asa, Yehoshafat, Yehoram, Ahaziah, Yoash, Amatzyahu, Uzziah, Yotam, Hezekiah, Menashe, Amon, Josiah, Yehoyakim. When Zedekiah came, as it is written: “He blinded the eyes of Zedekiah” (Jeremiah 52:11), the light of the moon was lacking. All those years, even though Israel was sinning, the patriarchs were praying for them and making peace between Israel and the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “Let the mountains bear peace to the people” (Psalms 72:3), and the mountains are nothing other than the patriarchs, as it is stated: “Hear, O heights, the Lord’s grievance” (Micah 6:2). Until when were the patriarchs praying for them? Until Zedekiah lost his eyes and the Temple was destroyed, as it is stated: “And abundance of peace, until the moon is no more,” until thirty generations that Israel had royalty. From that moment until now, who makes peace for Israel? It is the Lord, as it is stated: “May the Lord lift His countenance to you and grant you peace” (Numbers 6:26).
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – that is what is written: “You shall say to Pharaoh: So said the Lord: Israel is My firstborn son. I have said to you: Let My son go, and he will serve Me; and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will kill your firstborn son.” (Exodus 4:22–23). May the name of the Holy One blessed be He be exalted, as He “declares the end from the beginning” (Isaiah 46:10). Regarding Abraham it says: “Also that nation, whom they will serve, I will judge [<i>dan</i>]” (Genesis 15:14). What is <i>dan</i>? The plague of the firstborn, which is called an affliction [<i>nega</i>], as it is stated: “One further affliction [<i>nega</i>] [will I bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt; afterward he will send you forth from this]” (Exodus 11:1). What is: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] will judge?”<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The question is about the use of the word <i>anokhi</i> for the first person singular.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: “I will exact retribution from them with the plague of the firstborn, as it is stated: “Behold, I [<i>anokhi</i>] will kill your firstborn son.” The Holy One blessed be He passed this sign to Abraham, and Abraham to Isaac, Isaac to Jacob, Jacob to Levi, Levi to Kehat, Kehat to Amram, and Amram to Moses. Moses kept it as he proceeded. What is: “Israel is My firstborn son?” Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Sons whose fathers blessed them with their actions. That is Abraham as it is stated: “Blessed is Abram to God the Most High” (Genesis 14:19). Alternatively: “Israel is My firstborn son” – sons of he who took the birthright.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to Jacob, who bought the birthright from Esau. See Genesis 25:29–34.</i> Alternatively: “Israel is My firstborn son” – the Holy One blessed be He said to the wicked Pharaoh: ‘Do you not know how much I value the firstborn, as I wrote in My Torah: “Do not work your firstborn ox” (Deuteronomy 15:19). Anyone who works it is beaten, and you extended your hand against My firstborn; justice demands that you will be beaten.’ <br>The Holy One blessed be He brought ten plagues upon him corresponding to the ten trials with which Abraham was tested and he withstood them all. He brought them through Moses and through Aaron and by Himself. This is analogous to a king against whom ten provinces rebelled. He took with him two generals and went and conquered them. The king said: If I record them [the victories] in my name, how can I accord them honor? If I record them in their names, I exclude myself. Rather, I will divide them into three,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Three provinces for each of them. </i> and there is one extra, and I will divide it among the three of us. Thus, the plague of boils was performed by the three of them. What does it say regarding the boils: “Upon the magicians [<i>baḥartumim</i>]” (Exodus 9:11), is defective,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">It is without a <i>yod</i>, as though <i>baḥartumam </i>is written, meaning their magician. </i> meaning that it afflicted their angel on high, so they would have no ability to resist. <br>He brought ten plagues upon them like a military campaign.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Tanḥuma</i>, <i>Bo</i> 4. </i> The frogs were especially hard on them, as it is stated: “Frogs that destroyed them” (Psalms 78:45), as they wounded their bodies and castrated them [the Egyptians], as it is stated: “And into your bedchamber, and onto your bed” (Exodus 7:28). The frogs said to them: ‘The image of their God<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The Egyptians had tried to prevent Israel from procreating, and having children is, as it were, reproducing the image of God.</i> is nullified, and yours [your ability to procreate] remains intact?’ Therefore: “That destroyed them [<i>vatashḥitem</i>],” as it says: “And he spilled it [<i>veshiḥet</i>] on the ground” (Genesis 38:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to Onan, who spilled his seed on the ground rather than procreate with Tamar.</i> From where [is the proof] that they [the frogs] spoke [<i>medabberot</i>]: “Regarding [<i>al devar</i>] the frogs that He had brought upon Pharaoh” (Exodus 8:8). <br>Moreover, He brought upon them the plague of wild beasts [<i>arov</i>], because they were all intermingled [<i>me’urbavin</i>]; one man consorted with ten women, and ten men consorted with one woman; therefore, He brought a mixture [<i>irbuvya</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Irbuvya</i> and <i>me’urbavin</i> are from the same root as <i>arov</i>.</i> upon them. <br>When the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “One further affliction [<i>nega</i>] will I bring upon Pharaoh” (Exodus 11:1), Moses said: The sign has arrived [<i>higia</i>]. “One was Abraham” (Ezekiel 33:24) – behold, it is the affliction of the “one”.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham is described as one, and the fact that God said “one further affliction” rather than simply: A further affliction, alluded to the fact that it was the plague that Abraham had been told about. </i> Since they [Israel] were firstborn, He therefore killed the firstborn, as it is stated: “Behold, I will kill your firstborn son” (Exodus 4:23). That is the sign to Abraham: “I will judge” (Genesis 15:14) <br>Another matter: Why is Israel called “My firstborn son”? Because it is written in the Torah: “Rather, he shall acknowledge the firstborn son of the hated, giving him a double portion” (Deuteronomy 21:17); so too, Israel inherits two worlds, this world and the World to Come. That is why the Holy One blessed be He gave the secret of [calculating the waxing and waning of] the moon to Israel, that they should count on its basis, but the idolaters count on the basis of the sun; that is to say, just as the sun rules only during the day, so too, they rule only in this world, and just as the sun is made of fire, so, they are destined to be punished in it, as it is stated: “Behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace” (Malachi 3:19). And just as the moon is seen during the day and at night, so, Israel rules in this world and in the World to Come. And just as the moon is made of light, so, Israel inherits the light, as it is stated: “Light is sown for the righteous” (Psalms 97:11), and it says: “Arise, shine, for your light has arrived” (Isaiah 60:1). That is why it says: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – it shall be yours, because you are of the same type [as the moon].
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – this is one of the four matters that the Holy One blessed be He showed Moses with His finger,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">In the four cases listed in this midrash, Scripture uses the indicative “this.” The midrash takes it to be a literal case of indicating, pointing. </i> because he was having difficulty with them. He showed him the preparation of the anointing oil, as it is stated: “This shall be a holy anointing oil for Me…” (Exodus 30:31). He showed him the crafting of the Candelabrum, as it is stated: “This is the work of the Candelabrum” (Numbers 8:4). He showed him the swarming creatures, as it is stated: “And this is impure for you [among the swarming things that swarm on the earth]” (Leviticus 11:29), and the moon, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you.” He shook the seas and showed him the crocodile,<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Which hides in the water and is difficult to see.</i> as it is stated: “The voice of the Lord is on the water” (Psalms 29:3). He shook the inhabited world and showed him the turtle,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Which hides from people and is not readily visible.</i> as it is stated: “The voice of God breaks the cedars” (Psalms 29:5). He shook the wilderness and showed him the <i>du’ar</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">A legendary poisonous creature that lives in the desert, the product of the mating of a snake and a turtle. Also known as the <i>arod</i>, and the <i>ḥavarvar</i>. See <i>Ḥullin</i> 127a.</i> as it is stated: “The voice of God shakes the wilderness” (Psalms 29:8). He shook the fire and showed him the salamander,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">According to legend, salamanders are born of fire.</i> as it is stated: “The voice of God hews the flames of the fire” (Psalms 29:7). When did He do this for him? In the context of: “And this is impure for you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The list of impure animals. </i> He shook the world and showed him the moon, as it is stated: “The voice of the Lord is powerful” (Psalms 29:4). He shook the world and showed him the crafting of the Candelabrum, as it is stated: “The voice of the Lord is glorious” (Psalms 29:4). He shook the world and showed him the preparation of the anointing oil, as it is stated: “The voice of the Lord causes deer to give birth [<i>yeḥolel</i>]” (Psalms 29:9);<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yeḥolel </i>can also mean shake.</i> “and He bared the forests” (Psalms 29:9) – these are the spices of the incense.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Most of the spices are plant-based and are found in forests.</i> “And in His Sanctuary all say glory” (Psalms 29:9) – all the kings, each one of them speaks of the glory of the Holy One blessed be He, and they all began giving Him praise, as it is stated: “All the kings of the earth shall give thanks to You” (Psalms 138:4).
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” (Exodus 12:2) – the ways of the Holy One blessed be He is not like the ways of flesh and blood. The way of flesh and blood is that two stand before the king; one prosecutes him [the accused] and one defends him. Not everyone who prosecutes defends, and one who defends does not prosecute. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so; He defends and He prosecutes. The mouth that said: “Alas, a sinful nation” (Isaiah 1:4), is the mouth that said: “Open the gates, and let the righteous nation enter” (Isaiah 26:2). The mouth that said: “A people laden with iniquity” (Isaiah 1:4), is that which said: “Your people shall all be righteous” (Isaiah 60:21). The mouth that said: “Children who deal corruptly” (Isaiah 1:4), is that which said: “And all your children will be disciples of the Lord” (Isaiah 54:13). The mouth that said: “Evildoing descendants” (Isaiah 1:4), is that which said: “Their descendants will be renowned among the nations” (Isaiah 61:9). The mouth that said: “Even if you increase your prayers, I will not hear” (Isaiah 1:15), is the mouth that said: “It will be, before they call, I will answer” (Isaiah 65:24). The mouth that said: “Your New Moons and your festivals My soul despises” (Isaiah 1:14), is the mouth that said: “It will be that on every New Moon […all flesh will come to prostrate themselves to Me]” (Isaiah 66:23). Why does it say: “Your New Moons” [i.e., the celebration of the first of the month]? It is because the months are a gift to Israel, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – this is analogous to a king who had treasuries filled with gold, silver, gems, and pearls. He had one son. As long as the son was young, his father kept everything. When the son grew and became an adult, his father said to him: ‘As long as you were young, I kept everything; now that you have become an adult, everything is given to you.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He kept everything, as it is stated: “And they will be for signs, and for festivals” (Genesis 1:14). When Israel arose, He gave them everything, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you.”
Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – this is analogous to a king who betrothed a woman and wrote her [a marriage contract endowing her] minimally. When [the time] came to marry her, he wrote her [a contract endowing her with] numerous gifts, as a husband. So, this world is betrothal, as it is stated: “I will betroth you to Me forever” (Hosea 2:21), and He gave them only the moon, as it is stated: “This month shall be for you.” However, in the days of the Messiah, it will be marriage, as it is stated: “For your Husband is your Maker” (Isaiah 54:5). At that time, He will give them everything, as it is stated: “The wise will shine like the brightness of the sky; and those who lead the many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever” (Daniel 12:3).

Chapter 16

<b>“Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said to them: Draw, and take for yourselves lambs for your families, and slaughter the paschal offering” (Exodus 12:21).</b> <br>“Moses called all the elders of Israel” – that is what is written: “With the aged is wisdom and with the length of days understanding” (Job 12:12). Why did the elders merit that Israel was redeemed through them? When the Holy One blessed be He appeared to Moses at the bush, He said to him: “Go, and gather the elders of Israel” (Exodus 3:16). When Moses came, immediately: “Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel” (Exodus 4:29), and it says: “The people believed” (Exodus 4:31). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I will repay the elders for causing Israel to believe in My name. When Moses said: “And I say to them: The God of your fathers has sent me to you” (Exodus 3:13), had the elders not accepted Moses’ statement, all of Israel would not have accepted it either. Rather, the elders accepted it first, and drew all of Israel after them, and caused them to believe in the name of the Holy One blessed be He. I, too, will accord them honor, and the redemption of Israel will be through them, as Israel will slaughter their paschal offering through them, as it is stated: “Moses called all the elders of Israel.” Therefore, the verse praises them: “With the aged is wisdom.”
“Draw, and take for yourselves lambs” – that is what is written: “With stillness and pleasantness you will be saved” (Isaiah 30:15). We learned: One may heal himself with anything except for idol worship, forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed. How so? If they will say to a person: ‘Come and kill a person and you will be healed,’ he may not heed them, as it is written: “One who sheds the blood of a man, his blood will be shed by man” (Genesis 9:6). Since “one who sheds the blood of a man, his blood will be shed by man,” how could the ill person be healed by means of bloodshed? <br>Forbidden sexual relations, how so? If they will say to a person: ‘Engage in forbidden sexual relations and you will be healed,’ he may not heed them, as it is prohibited for a person to engage in forbidden sexual relations. You find two adjacent Torah portions, the portion of the nazirite, and the portion of the <i>sota</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The laws of the <i>sota</i> appears in Numbers 5:11–31. The laws of the nazirite appear in Numbers 6:1–21. </i> The nazirite vows not to drink wine. The Holy One blessed be He says to him: ‘You vowed not to drink wine in order to distance yourself from transgression. Do not say: I will eat grapes and it will not be a sin.’ The Holy One blessed be He says to him: ‘Since you vowed to refrain from wine, I will teach you not to sin before Me.’ He said to Moses: ‘Teach Israel the laws of naziriteship, as it is stated: “If a man explicitly vows…from wine and intoxicating drink he shall abstain…he shall not eat anything that is made of the grapevine” (Numbers 6:2–4). When he does so, he is like an angel, “all the days of his naziriteship, he is holy to the Lord” (Numbers 6:8), as you say: “A watcher and a holy one [came down from Heaven]” (Daniel 4:10). <br>Likewise, a woman is called a grapevine, as it is stated: “Your wife is like a fruitful vine” (Psalms 128:3). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Do not say: Since it is prohibited for me to engage in relations with the woman, I will grab her and it will not be a sin for me, I will fondle her and it will not be a sin for me, or I will kiss her and it will not be a sin for me.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Just as if a nazirite has vowed not to drink wine, it is prohibited [for him] to eat moist and dry grapes, and food that is soaked in wine, and anything that emerges from the grapevine; so, too, a woman who is not your wife, you may not touch her at all, as Solomon says: “Can a man stoke fire in his bosom and his garments not be burned…so one who goes in to his neighbor's wife; anyone who touches her will not be absolved” (Proverbs 6:27–9). <br>This is why the Holy One blessed be He [wrote] the portion of the nazirite adjacent to the portion of the <i>sota</i>, because they are similar to one another. And anyone who touches a woman who is not his wife brings death upon himself, as it is stated: “For she has felled many corpses” (Proverbs 7:26), and it is written: “Her feet descend to death; her steps support one to the grave” (Proverbs 5:5). Since she has all these attributes, how can she give life to the ill? Therefore, one may not heal himself through her. <br>Idol worship, how so? If a person of Israel is ill and they say to him: ‘Go to such and such idol and be healed,’ it is prohibited to go, as it says: “One who sacrifices to gods shall be destroyed, except to the Lord alone” (Exodus 22:19). Since everyone who worships idols shall be destroyed, it is preferable for him to die from the illness than to perform an act for which he will be destroyed in this world.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In addition to suffering in the next world. </i> Not only that [act of idol worship] is prohibited, but it is prohibited to heal oneself with anything associated with idol worship. If they say to a person: ‘Take from what they are burning to idols, or take from a tree worshipped as idolatry and make it into an amulet and be healed,’ do not take it, as it is written: “Nothing of the banned items shall cleave to your hand” (Deuteronomy 13:18). This [prohibition] is [referring to anything used for] idolatry. And it says: “You shall not bring an abomination into your home and become banned like it” (Deuteronomy 7:26). Why? It is because they have no substance and they are to no avail, as it is stated: “Do not fear them, for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good” (Jeremiah 10:5). <br>Likewise, you find that Jeremiah said to his generation: ‘I am going to enter into a confrontation with idol worship, and I will state its actions and the actions of God, and the differences between the Holy One blessed be He and idol worship will be known.’ You find four times on one page that Jeremiah demonstrated the denigration of idol worship and praise of God, as it is stated: “So said the Lord: Do not learn the way of the nations…as the customs of the peoples are vanity” (Jeremiah 10:2–3); “they beautify it with silver and with gold… they are like a date palm, a block of wood, [and they do not speak; they are carried because they do not walk]” (Jeremiah 10: 4–5). <br>You have heard the denigration of idol worship, come and hear the praise of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “There is no one like You, Lord” (Jeremiah 10:6); “who would not fear You, king of nations” (Jeremiah 10:7). <br>You have heard the praise of the Holy One blessed be He, come and hear the denigration of idol worship, as it is stated: “But they are altogether brutish and foolish…silver beaten into plates will be brought from Tarshish…” (Jeremiah 10:8–9). <br>You have heard the denigration of idol worship, come and hear the praise of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord God is true” (Jeremiah 10:10). <br>You have heard the praise of the Holy One blessed be He, come and hear the denigration of idol worship, as it is stated: “So you shall say to them: The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens” (Jeremiah 10:11). <br>You have heard the denigration of idol worship, come and hear the praise of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He made the earth with His power…at the sound of His giving a multitude of water in the heavens” (Jeremiah 10:12–13). <br>You have heard the praise of the Holy One blessed be He, come and hear the denigration of idol worship, as it is stated: “Every man is proved to be foolish, without knowledge… they are vanity, a work of delusion” (Jeremiah 10:14–15). <br>You have heard the denigration of idol worship, come and hear the praise of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Not like these is the portion of Jacob; for He is the Maker of all things…” (Jeremiah 10:16). <br>The Holy One blessed be He said: Since it is like an inanimate stone and lacks substance, and others guard it so it will not be stolen, how can it give life to an ill person? Therefore, it is prohibited to heal oneself with anything associated with it. Likewise you find regarding Israel when they were in Egypt, they would worship idols and they would not forsake them, as it is stated: “Each man did not cast away the abominations of their eyes” (Ezekiel 20:8). The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘As long as Israel is worshipping the gods of Egypt they will not be redeemed. Go and say to them that they should abandon their evil deeds and repudiate idol worship.’ That is what is written: “Draw, and take for yourselves” (Exodus 12:21), meaning draw your hands away from idol worship and “take for yourselves lambs” and slaughter the gods of Egypt and perform [the rite of] the paschal offering, as thereby, the Holy One blessed be He will pass over you; that is: “With stillness and pleasantness you will be saved” (Isaiah 30:15).
Another interpretation, “draw, and take for yourselves lambs” – that is what is written: “All who serve graven images shall be shamed” (Psalms 97:7). When the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses to slaughter the paschal offering, Moses said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, how can I do so? Do You not know that lambs are the gods of Egypt?’ As it is stated: “Behold, were we to sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, would they not stone us?” (Exodus 8:22). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘By your life, Israel will not depart from here until they slaughter the god of Egypt before their eyes, as I will thereby inform them that their gods are nothing.’ <br>And we find that He did so, as on that night He smote the firstborn of Egypt, on that night Israel slaughtered their paschal offerings and ate them, and the Egyptians saw their firstborn killed and their gods slaughtered and they were unable to do anything, as it is stated: “The Egyptians were burying they whom the Lord had smitten among them, all their firstborn, and upon their gods the Lord administered punishments” (Numbers 33:4); that is: “All who serve graven images shall be shamed.”
Another interpretation, “draw, and take for yourselves lambs” – that is what is written: “A just balance and scales are the Lord's” (Proverbs 16:11), and likewise we find that Moses and Samuel are equal, and it is stated: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name” (Psalms 99:6). Come and see how many differences there are between Moses and Samuel. Moses would enter before the Holy One blessed be He to hear the [divine] speech, while with Samuel, the Holy One blessed be He would come [to him], as it is stated: “The Lord came and stood” (I Samuel 3:10). <br>Why was it so? The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘With justice and righteousness I interact with the person.’ Moses would sit, and anyone who had a case would come before him and be judged, as it is stated: “It was on the next day that Moses sat to judge the people” (Exodus 18:13). But Samuel would take the trouble to go to each and every province and judge, so they would not need to inconvenience themselves to come to him, as it is stated: “He would go each and every year […and he judged Israel in all those places]” (I Samuel 7:16). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Moses, who would sit in one place and judge Israel, will come to Me to the Tent of Meeting to hear the [divine] speech. But Samuel, who would go to Israel in the towns and judge them, I will go and speak to him, to fulfill what is stated: “A just balance and scales are the Lord's.”’ <br>Likewise, we found regarding Judah; because he saved three lives, Tamar and her two sons, from the fire, the Holy One blessed be He saved three of his descendants from the fire. Who were they? Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya. That is, “a just balance and scales are the Lord's.” <br>Likewise in Egypt, Israel was enslaved for eighty years.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is referring to the harshest period of enslavement, beginning from the decree to kill the baby boys, which was issued shortly before the birth of Moses. Moses was eighty when Israel was redeemed from Egypt (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>). </i> An Egyptian would go into the wilderness, catch a deer or gazelle and slaughter it, place the pot on the fire, cook and eat, and Israel would see and would not taste it, as it is stated: “When we sat by the fleshpot, when we ate bread to satiation” (Exodus 16:3). It does not say: When we ate from the fleshpot, but rather, “when we sat [by the fleshpot],” as they would eat their bread without meat. The Holy One blessed be He said to them [the Egyptians]: ‘You caused My children to drool [from hunger] with the meat that you would eat, and you would not give them any; I, too, will arrange for My children to slaughter the lambs to which you prostrate yourselves. They will eat and you will be envious. Why? Because I am the true judge.’ That is: “A just balance and scales are the Lord's.” That is why it is stated: “Draw, and take for yourselves lambs.” <br>

Chapter 17

<b>“You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and touch the lintel and the two doorposts with the blood that is in the basin; and you shall not go out, each from the door of his house, until the morning” (Exodus 12:22).</b> <br> “You shall take a bunch of hyssop” – that is what is written: “Everything the Lord has done is for His purpose” (Proverbs 16:4). You find that everything that the Holy One blessed be He created during the six days of Creation, He created only for His glory and to perform His will with them. On the first day, He created the heavens and the earth, and He created them, too, for His glory, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, the heavens are My throne” (Isaiah 66:1), and it says: “The heavens relate the glory of God” (Psalms 19:2). Likewise, the light that He created was for His glory, as it is written: “He covers Himself with light as with a garment” (Psalms 104:2). <br>What was created on the second day? The firmament, and He created it for His glory, so that the angels would stand there and laud him, as it is stated: “Praise Him in the firmament of His power” (Psalms 150:1). <br>What did He create on the third day? Grasses and trees, and we found that the grasses laud the Holy One blessed be He as it is stated: “They shout for joy, they even sing” (Psalms 65:14). From where is it derived that the same is true of the trees? It is as it is stated: “Then the trees of the forest will sing before the Lord” (I Chronicles 16:33). You find that the Holy One blessed be He issued a command to perform <i>mitzvot </i>with the trees. Regarding the red heifer, He issued a command to cast into its conflagration cedar wood and hyssop; He issued a command to perform the sprinkling of the waters of sprinkling with hyssop;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">After the red heifer is burned, its ashes are mixed with spring water and a priest uses hyssop to sprinkle the mixture on people or objects that have become impure due to contact with a corpse. See Numbers 19:17–18. </i> and He commanded to perform the purification of the leper with cedar wood and hyssop. Likewise, in Egypt, He issued a command to apply the blood to the lintel and the two doorposts with hyssop, as it is stated: “You shall take a bunch of hyssop.” Likewise, He created the water on the third day, as He collected it from covering the earth. From there, His laudation ascends, as it is stated: “From the sound of much water, the mighty breakers of the sea, [the Lord on high is mighty]” (Psalms 93:4). <br>What was created on the fourth day? The lights, and He created them for His glory, as it is stated: “Praise Him, sun and moon; [praise Him, all stars of light]” (Psalms 148:3). On the fifth day, He created the birds for His glory, to sacrifice an offering from them, as it is stated: “If his offering is a burnt offering from the birds…” (Leviticus 1:14). What was created on the sixth day? Animals, for His glory, and He commanded to sacrifice an offering from them, as it is stated: “A person among you who sacrifices an offering to the Lord from the animal, from the cattle” (Leviticus 1:2). And He created man for His glory, as it is stated: “Praise the Lord, from the earth, sea creatures…[young men…elders…let them praise the name of the Lord]” (Psalms 148:7, 12–13); that is: “Everything the Lord has done is for His purpose.”
Another matter: “You shall take a bunch of hyssop” – that is what is written: “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest [so is my beloved]” (Song of Songs 2:3). Why is the Holy One blessed be He likened to an apple tree? It is to say to you: Just as the apple tree appears to the eye with nothing,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It does not have many leaves when its fruit first appear. </i> but it has taste and fragrance, the same is true of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “His palate is sweet; all of Him is lovely” (Song of Songs 5:16). He appeared to idolaters but they did not wish to accept the Torah, and the Torah was in their eyes like a matter lacking substance, but [in fact] it has taste and aroma. Taste [<i>ta’am</i>], from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Consider [<i>ta’amu</i>] and see that the Lord is good” (Psalms 34:9). It has food, as it is written: “My fruit is better than gold, than fine gold” (Proverbs 8:19). It has fragrance, as it is stated: “The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon” (Song of Songs 4:11). Israel said: We know the power of Torah; therefore, we will not move from the Holy One blessed be He and his Torah, as it is stated: “In its shadow I delighted and sat, and its fruit was sweet to my palate” (Song of Songs 2:3). <br>Likewise, there are items that appear to be lowly, and the Holy One blessed be He issued a command to perform several <i>mitzvot</i> with them. The hyssop appears to a person to be insignificant, but its power is great before God, as in several places He analogizes it to the cedar: In the purification of the leper, the burning of the heifer, and in Egypt he issued a command to perform a <i>mitzva </i>with the hyssop, as it is stated: “You shall take a bunch of hyssop.” Likewise, regarding Solomon it is stated: “He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that emerges from the wall” (I Kings 5:13), to teach that large and small are equal before the Holy One blessed be He. With small items He performs miracles, and by means of the hyssop, which is the lowliest of the trees, he redeemed Israel; that is: “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest.”
Another matter, “you shall take a bunch of [<i>agudat</i>] hyssop,” – in other words, I will render you an association [<i>aguda</i>] for Myself, even though you are lowly like the hyssop, as it is stated: “And you will be My treasure from all the peoples” (Exodus 19:5). <br>“And dip it in the blood that is in the basin.” What did the Holy One blessed be He see [that led Him] to protect them with blood? It was in order to evoke for them the blood of Abraham’s circumcision. It was with two bloods that Israel was rescued from Egypt; the blood of the paschal offering and the blood of circumcision, as it is stated: “I said to you: With your blood, live; I said to you: With your blood, live” (Ezekiel 16:6) – with the blood of the paschal offering and the blood of circumcision. “And touch the lintel,” – due to the merit of Abraham; “and on the two doorposts,” – due to the merit of Isaac and Jacob. Due to their merit, He will see the blood “and will not allow the destroyer to come to your houses to smite you” (Exodus 12:23).
 “The Lord will pass to smite Egypt” – some say by means of an angel, and some say the Holy One blessed be He Himself. What is it that is stated: “To smite [<i>lingof</i>]”? It teaches that even the pregnant women miscarried and the mothers died, and the destroyer emerged and harmed everything that it found. <i>Lingof </i>refers to nothing other than pregnant women, as it is stated: “And they strike [<i>venagefu</i>] a pregnant woman” (Exodus 21:22). The Holy One blessed be He was destroying the firstborn of Egypt, and Israel was performing everything that the Holy One blessed be He said to them, as it is stated: “The children of Israel went and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron” (Exodus 12:28). <br>To what were the Holy One blessed be He and Israel comparable? To a king who travelled with his sons by sea, and pirate ships surrounded them. He said to them: Here are my giant spears, all prepared, with which I pass over the sea waves and do battle. So, the Holy One blessed be He was with His children in Egypt, and the Egyptian camps were plotting against them all night. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: Such wicked ones, are you plotting against My children? My giant spears are prepared, as it is stated: “He saved them for His name’s sake” (Psalms 106:8). <br> [The Israelites] were engaged in roasting [the paschal offering], and the Holy One blessed be He was killing the firstborn of Egypt; they were sprinkling [blood] on their entrances, and His great name was standing over their entrances. They were engaged in <i>Hallel</i>, and the laws of the paschal offering, and God was distinguishing so that the blood of the impure would atone for the blood of the pure,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The death of the Egyptian firstborn atoned for the firstborn of Israel.</i> as it is stated: “The Lord redeems the soul of His servants” (Psalms 34:23). They were engaged in their <i>matzot</i>, as they were grinding and kneading, and the Holy One blessed be He was uprooting the plants<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the Egyptian firstborn, who were killed even in utero. </i> of Egypt, as it is stated: “Arise, Lord, in your anger [lift Yourself up in indignation [<i>be’avrot</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash expounds <i>be’avrot</i>, indignation, as though it were <i>be’ubarot</i>, meaning fetuses.</i> against my adversaries]” (Psalms 7:7).
<b>“The Lord will pass to smite Egypt, and He will see the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts, and the Lord will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come to your houses to smite you” (Exodus 12:23).</b> <br> “The Lord will pass to smite Egypt” – that is what is written: “What shall I do when God rises? When He reckons, what shall I answer Him?” (Job 31:14). Who stated this verse? It was the angel who oversees the world who said it, even though Job said it regarding himself. Likewise, all mankind are destined to say thus. We find regarding the generation of the flood that God judged them while sitting, as it is stated: “The Lord sat enthroned at the flood” (Psalms 29:10). What is written in their regard? “He blotted out all existence” (Genesis 7:23). But, in Egypt, He judged them while passing, as it is stated: “The Lord will pass to smite Egypt,” and it is written: “I will pass in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12). However, in the future, He will stand and judge His world while standing, as it is stated: “And His feet will stand on that day” (Zechariah 14:4), and it is written: “Therefore wait for Me, said the Lord, until the day that I rise up forever; [for My determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them My indignation, all My fierce anger; for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of My jealousy]” (Zephaniah 3:8). <br>Mankind will say: If while sitting He judged the generation of the flood and blotted them out, and He judged the Egyptians while passing and killed their firstborn, when He stands in the future to judge His world, who will be able to withstand it? Therefore, it is written: “What shall I do when God rises?” Why is He destined to stand? It is because of the outcry of the poor, as it is stated: “For the oppression of the poor, for the sigh of the needy, now I will rise, says the Lord” (Psalms 12:6).

Chapter 18

<b>“It was at midnight, and the Lord smote all firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle” (Exodus 12:29).</b> <br>“It was at midnight” – that is what is written: “Who fulfills the word of His servant and performs the counsel of His messengers” (Isaiah 44:26). Rabbi Abahu says: “Who fulfills the word of His servant,” this [servant] is Moses, as it is stated: “My servant Moses is not so, [he is trusted in all My house]” (Numbers 12:7). How did He fulfill [the word of Moses]? When He brought the plague of darkness upon them, Pharaoh began screaming: “Go serve the Lord; only your flocks and your herds will remain…” (Exodus 10:24). Moses said to him: ‘By your life, “no hoof will remain”’ (Exodus 10:26). What is “hoof”? Even an animal which belongs entirely to an Egyptian, but it has one hoof that belongs to an Israelite, he will not leave it. “As we will take from them” (Exodus 10:26) – after saying: “As we will take from them,” he then said: “And we will not know with what we will serve the Lord” (Exodus 10:26). You, who are flesh and blood, people die if they violate your commands, and if you issue an edict and say: ‘Collect for me such and such,’ the world will be able to fulfill your edict; however, we, perhaps God will say to us, ‘sacrifice an offering of two hundred and ten years’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">During all those years we did not sacrifice any offerings.</i> – that is: “And we will not know.” <br>Pharaoh said to him: ‘Until when will you enter here? “Go from me, beware, do not see my face anymore”’ (Exodus 10:28). Moses said to him: “You have spoken well; I will not see your face anymore” (Exodus 10:29).The Holy One blessed be He said: What do I still need to inform Pharaoh? It is one plague. Immediately, God rushed to him, as it were, and entered into Pharaoh’s palace on Moses’s behalf, who said to him: “I will not see your face anymore,” so he would not be found to be a liar. You find that the Holy One blessed be He spoke to Moses in Pharaoh’s palace only at that time. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “As I leave the city, I will spread my hands to the Lord” (Exodus 9:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Moses did not want to pray in Pharaoh’s palace or even in the city, due to the presence of idols there. Similarly, God did not speak to Moses there. See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 12:5 and 15:5. </i> But now, the Holy One blessed be He rushed and spoke with Moses, as it is stated: “One more plague I will bring upon Pharaoh…” (Exodus 11:1). <br>When Moses heard, he rejoiced and was exalted, as it is stated: “Moreover the man Moses was very great” (Exodus 11:3). He began shouting publicly: “So said the Lord: About midnight, [I will emerge in the midst of Egypt]” (Exodus 11:4). “You have spoken well; I will not see your face anymore.” ‘I will not come to you anymore, but you will come to me. This general that is standing with you, and this prefect of yours, and all the officers of your palace, will come to me with you, requesting of me, and prostrating themselves to me, so that we will depart from here, as it is written: “All these, your servants, will come down to me, and prostrate themselves to me, saying: [Go out, you and all the people that follow you]” (Exodus 11:8). He did not want to say “you will prostrate yourself to me” as a show of deference to the kingdom. <br>When midnight arrived, as Moses had said, immediately: “it was at midnight, and the Lord smote all the firstborn” – therefore [the verse states], “Who fulfills the word of His servant.” “And performs the counsel of His messengers,” for [God] consulted with Abraham concerning this matter. When? It was when the kings came and [Abraham] pursued them, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘It is sufficient for you [to pursue them] until midnight. Come let us divide the night between Me and you,’ as it is stated: “And he divided the night between them” (Genesis 14:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This phrase is commonly translated: “He divided himself against them by night,” but the midrash is offering an alternate interpretation. </i> Once the hour arrived, the counsel was complete;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Once midnight arrived on the night of the plague of the firstborn, God completed the plan He had discussed with Abraham. </i> that is: “it was at midnight” – that is what is written: “And performs the counsel of His messengers.”
Another matter, “it was at midnight” – that is what is written: “At midnight I will rise to give thanks to You because of the ordinances [<i>mishpetei</i>] of Your righteousness” (Psalms 119:62). At midnight I will rise to give thanks to You for the judgments [<i>mishpatim</i>] that You performed in Egypt, and the righteousness that You performed for us. How so? Since Moses said: “I will smite all firstborn” (Exodus 12:12), there were some [Egyptians] who were afraid and some who were not afraid. One who was afraid would take his firstborn to an Israelite and would say to him: ‘Take this one and let him stay the night with you.’ <br>When midnight arrived, the Holy One blessed be He killed all the firstborn. For those who were located in the houses of the Israelites, the Holy One blessed be He would step between the Israelite and the Egyptian and would take the soul of the Egyptian and leave the soul of the Israelite. The Jew would awaken and find the Egyptian dead between each and every one [of his sons], as it is stated: “I will pass over you, and there will be no plague upon you” (Exodus 12:13). The Israelites began saying: “At midnight I will rise to give thanks to You.” That is why it is stated: “Because of the ordinances of Your righteousness.”
Another matter, “it was at midnight” – that is what is written: “She perceives that her merchandise is good; [her lamp] does not extinguish [at night]” (Proverbs 31:18). You find that the verse states: “As there was no house in which there was no one dead” (Exodus 12:30). How so? You calculate each and every drop that an Egyptian would expel to each and every woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">If it was the woman’s firstborn, even if it was not the man’s firstborn, he would die. </i> or that the first drop is a firstborn<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The man’s firstborn even if it is not the woman’s firstborn. </i> and all the sons would die, as it is written: “He smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the first potency in the tents of Ham” (Psalms 78:51). The females who were firstborn, they, too, died, except for Bitya, daughter of Pharaoh, for whom a good advocate was found; this is Moses, as it is stated: “She saw him, that he was good” (Exodus 2:2). Therefore, Solomon said: “She perceives that her merchandise is good.” “She arises while it is still night” (Proverbs 31:15). On which night? “It was at midnight.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">On the night of the plague of the firstborn. </i>
Another matter, “it was at midnight” – Elihu said: “In a moment they die, at midnight” (Job 34:20). When they died, everyone began screaming, as it is stated: “Pharaoh rose during the night, he, all his servants, and all of Egypt, [and there was a great cry in Egypt]” (Exodus 12:30). Immediately, [Pharaoh] “called for Moses and Aaron” (Exodus 12:31). Moses said to Him: ‘What does Pharaoh seek? Who comes to whom, you to me or me to you?’ [Pharaoh] said to him: ‘Please, “rise, depart from the midst of my people”’ (Exodus 12:31). Why? “He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; who has challenged Him and prospered?” (Job 9:4).
Another matter, “it was at midnight” – David said: “I will remember my song during the night” (Psalms 77:7). The congregation of Israel said: ‘We remember the disasters with which you would overcome the enemies on our behalf at night.’ “My song” means nothing other than disaster, as you say: “…I am their song [<i>manginatam</i>], [exact retribution against them, Lord]” (Lamentations 3:63–4), and it says: “Blessed is God Most High, who has delivered [<i>migen</i>] your enemies into your hand” (Genesis 14:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The term for “delivered,” <i>migen</i>, is related to the word for “song,” <i>negina</i>. </i> Sennacherib came against us and You overcame him at night, as it is stated: “It was that night, the angel of the Lord emerged, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians” (II Kings 19:35). <br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: Come and see the love of the Holy One blessed be He, for Israel, as the Holy One blessed be He rendered the ministering angels, who are “mighty in strength who fulfill His word” (Psalms 103:20), guardians of Israel. Who are they? Mikhael and Gavriel, as it is stated: “Upon your walls, I have set watchmen” (Isaiah 62:6). When Sennacheribcame, Mikhael emerged and smote them; and Gavriel rescued Ḥananya and his compatriots at the command of the Holy One blessed be He. <br>Why is it so? The Holy One blessed be He had set conditions with them. When? When He prepared to descend to rescue Abraham from the fiery furnace, Mikhael and Gavriel said before Him: ‘We will descend to rescue him.’ He said to them: ‘If [Abraham] had descended to the furnace for the sake of one of you, you would rescue him, but he descended for the sake of My name, and I will descend to rescue him,’ as it is stated: “I am the Lord who took you out of Ur of the Chaldeans” (Genesis 15:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The term Ur can also mean fire. This verse alludes to the fact that God saved Abraham from the fiery furnace. </i> ‘But because you were prepared to rescue him for the sake of My name, I will set a time for you when you will descend; you, Mikhael, against the Assyrian encampment and you, Gavriel, against the Chaldean encampment.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Chaldeans are associated with the Babylonians, who threw Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya into the fiery furnace. See Daniel chapter 3. </i> <br>When Gavriel descended to rescue Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, he decreed to the fire, and it emerged and burned all those who had cast them in, as it is stated: “The flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, [and Abednego]” (Daniel 3:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were the Babylonian names of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya (Daniel 1:7). </i> Some say: Four classes [of officers] died there; at first, it is written: “Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, and the king’s ministers…were assembled” (Daniel 3:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse there are actually eight different officials listed. It should be noted that “the king’s ministers” are not included in this verse, but rather in verse 27. </i> Here, [following this event,] four were missing, as it is stated: “And the satraps assembled…” (Daniel 3:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse there are only four different types of official listed.</i> Therefore, Ḥananya said: “Praise the Lord, all nations” (Psalms 117:1). Mishael said: “Laud Him, all the peoples” (Psalms 117:1). Azarya said: “For His mercy is great toward us” (Psalms 117:2). The angel said: “And the truth of the Lord endures forever” (Psalms 117:2); it is true what He said to me when I descended to rescue Abraham. <br>Likewise, Mikhael did what He told him, as it is stated: “It was that night, that the angel of the Lord emerged [and smote in the camp of the Assyrians…]” (II Kings 19:35). It was taught: All the generals and the commanders were drinking wine and they left their jugs cast aside. The Holy One blessed be He said to Sennacherib: ‘You did yours,’<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">You did it by means of messengers.</i> as it is stated: “By your messengers you taunted” (II Kings 19:23); ‘I, too, [will act] by means of My messengers.’ <br>What did He do to him? “And instead of his glory, a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire” (Isaiah 10:16). What is “instead of his glory”? It is that He burned their bodies from within and left their garments [intact] on the outside, as the glory of a person is his garment. Why did he leave their garments [intact]? It is because they were the descendants of Shem, as it is stated: “The children of Shem: Eilam and Ashur…” (Genesis 10:22). The Holy One blessed be He said: I am indebted to their ancestor Shem, as he and Yefet took their garments and covered their father’s nakedness, as it is stated: “Shem and Yefet took the garment” (Genesis 9:23); that is why the Holy One blessed be He said to Mikhael: ‘Leave their garments intact and burn their souls.’ What is written there? “They awoke early in the morning, and behold, they were all dead corpses” (II Kings 19:35). That is what is written: “Each morning I will destroy all the wicked of the land” (Psalms 101:8). <br>The people of Israel and Hezekiah were sitting and reciting <i>hallel</i>, as it was the [first] night of Passover, and they were afraid, saying: ‘Now Jerusalem will be conquered by his hand [Sennacherib].’ When they awoke in the morning to stand and recite <i>Shema </i>and pray, they found their enemies “dead corpses.” That is why the Holy One blessed be He said to Isaiah: “Call his name Maher Shalal Ḥash Baz” (Isaiah 8:3),<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This means: Plunder hastens, spoils quicken.</i> and he quickly plundered their spoils. And he called the name of the other one: “Immanu El” (Isaiah 7:14),<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, God is with us.</i> saying that I am with him, as it is stated: “With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God” (II Chronicles 32:8). <br>Just as the Holy One blessed be He acted in this world through Mikhael and Gavriel, so too, in the future, He will act through them, as it is stated: “Saviors will ascend to Mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau” (Obadiah 1:21) – these are Mikhael and Gavriel. Our saintly Rabbi<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> says: This [verse refers to] Mikhael himself, as it is stated: “At that time, Mikhael the great angel, who stands for the members of Your people, will stand” (Daniel 12:1), as he is an advocate for the needs of Israel, and speaks on their behalf, as it is stated: “The angel of the Lord spoke and said: Lord of hosts, how long will You not have compassion on Jerusalem…” (Zechariah 1:12), and it says: “And there is no one who helps me against these, except for Mikhael, your prince” (Daniel 10:21). <br>Rabbi Yosei said: To what are Mikhael and Samael comparable? To an advocate and a prosecutor standing at trial. This one speaks and that one speaks. This one completes his contentions and that one his contentions. That advocate knows that he prevailed; he begins praising the judge [and imploring him] to issue his ruling. The prosecutor seeks to add to his statement, and the advocate says to him: ‘Be silent and let us hear the judge.’ So Mikhael and Samael stand before the Divine Presence, and the adversary<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Samael.</i> prosecutes and Mikhael speaks in defense of Israel. The adversary comes to speak and Mikhael silences him. Why? It is as it is stated: “I will hear what God the Lord will speak, as He will speak peace to His people” (Psalms 85:9); that is: “I will remember my song during the night,” regarding the miracle of Hezekiah. <br>Another matter, “I will remember my song [<i>neginati</i>],” – I remember what You did on our behalf in Egypt, and the strategies [<i>menagenin</i>] that You employed in Egypt. How so? Initially, when the Holy One blessed be He sought to bring plagues on the Egyptians, He intended to bring the plague of the firstborn first, as it is stated: “Behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn” (Exodus 4:23). [Pharaoh] began saying: “Who is the Lord that I should heed His voice?” (Exodus 5:2). The Holy One blessed be He said: If I bring the plague of the firstborn first, He will let them go; rather, I will bring other plagues upon him [first], and in the wake of this, I will bring them all, as it is stated: “And the Lord smote all the firstborn.”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The verse specifies that during the plague of the firstborn, God killed the firstborn of Pharaoh along with all the other firstborn of Egypt. Thus, God waited until after all the other plagues to kill Pharaoh’s firstborn (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Therefore, David lauds: “Who knows the power of Your anger?” (Psalms 90:11). Who knows Your strategies that you employed at the sea, as it is stated: “Your way in the sea, Your path in the great waters, and Your footsteps [<i>ikvotekha</i>] were not known” (Psalms 77:20); who knows the matters that You do at the end [<i>akev</i>]?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Who knows what God is doing to carry out His plans, and the great calculations that go into His actions? </i>
God said to Moses: ‘Tell Israel what you [all] should be doing, [and say:] You should know that He will smite Egypt,’ as it is stated: “The Lord will pass to smite Egypt, [and He will see the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts, and the Lord will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come to your houses to smite you]” (Exodus 12:23). <br>Rabbi Levi said: What is “the Lord will pass [<i>ve’avar</i>]”? The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I will renege [<i>over</i>] on what I said.’ This is analogous to a king whose son went to a barbaric foreign country. The barbarians stood and received him and crowned him king over them. The king heard and said: ‘What honor can I accord to these [people] who exalted my son and crowned him king over them? I will call the name of that province after my son.’ Sometime later, they reconsidered and cursed the king’s son and enslaved him. The king said: ‘I will renege on the honor that I accorded them; I will go out and wage war against them and rescue my son.’ Similarly, Joseph descended to Egypt and they received him and crowned him king over them, as it is stated: “Joseph was the ruler over the land” (Genesis 42:6). They honored Jacob, as it is stated: “Egypt wept for him seventy days” (Genesis 50:3). The Holy One blessed be He said: What honor will I accord Egypt? I will call it by the name of the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “Like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt” (Genesis 13:10). When they changed their minds and enslaved [the Israelites], the Holy One blessed be He said: “I will pass through the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12). I am reneging on that honor and I will render it desolation, as it is stated: “Egypt will become desolation” (Joel 4:19).
What is written above? “And the Lord will pass over the door” (Exodus 12:23) – at that moment, as it were, He stood at the entrance.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Since God Himself was present, what need was there to put the sign of the blood on the lintel in order that the destroyer would not kill the Israelite firstborn? </i> The way of the world is that, just as a slaughterer brings in his flock, and each lamb or sheep that he wants to slaughter, he takes red paint and marks it so he will recognize which to slaughter and which not to slaughter; so, “He will see the blood” (Exodus 12:23) – as it were, He stood at the entrance and repelled the destroyer so that it would not smite Israel. God said to them: “You shall observe this matter as an ordinance for you and for your sons forever” (Exodus 12:24). Just as I did for you now, so I am destined to do for you in the future, as it is stated: “For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace, [and all the proud, and all who perform evil, will be stubble; and the day that comes will set them ablaze…]” (Malachi 3:19), but you, “I will have mercy on them, as a man has mercy on his son” (Malachi 3:17).
Rabbi Ḥalafta said: May the name of the Holy One blessed be He be blessed, as there is nothing like His miracles and His wonders, and nothing like His might and His deeds, as it is stated: “Great is our Lord, and very powerful” (Psalms 147:5). The Holy One blessed be He is holy and pure, and extends His hand against the impure. Why? It is because He is great and awesome, and for the sake of Israel He informed [the world] of His strength. Why for the sake of Israel? It is because He said to Jacob: “I will descend with you to Egypt [and I will take you up again]” (Genesis 46:4). He wages Israel’s wars. One angel overturned Sodom, but here, “The Lord will emerge as a warrior, He will arouse jealousy” (Isaiah 42:13).
Another matter, “it was at midnight” – this is analogous to a king whose province departed [from the norm] and imposed [unusually harsh] servitude on the captives that came to them, and [the king] too diverted the course of justice against [the officials of that province] and killed them. Similarly, Egypt departed [from the norm and] imposed [unusually harsh] edicts on Israel to work day and night, and by assigning man’s work to a woman, and woman’s work to a man. So, too, God diverted the course of justice against them and killed them at night, as it is stated: “It was at midnight.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that judgement in court, and executions, are generally carried out by day. </i> Just as He overturned Sodom at night, so He killed the firstborn of Egypt at night. This is why David said: “You, You are awesome; who may stand before You when You are angry?” (Psalms 76:8).
The Holy One blessed be He performed many miracles on behalf of Israel. He killed the firstborn of Egypt, who were likened to an animal, as it is stated: “Whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys” (Ezekiel 23:20). He killed the firstborn of the captives, as they [the Egyptians] would say to the [non-Israelite] captive who was incarcerated in prison: ‘Is it your wish to be freed and Israel will be redeemed?’ he would say: ‘We will never leave here, so that Israel will not leave.’ Therefore, He judged them with [the Egyptians]. <br>”From the firstborn of Pharaoh…to the firstborn of the captive” – this is analogous to a king who made a celebration for his son and killed his enemies. The king said: Let anyone who is happy for me come to the celebration of my son, and anyone who hates me will be killed with the enemies. Similarly, God made a celebration for Israel when He redeemed them. God said: Let anyone who loves My son come and celebrate with My son. The virtuous Egyptians came and performed the paschal offering with Israel, and departed with them, as it is stated: “A mixed multitude ascended with them” (Exodus 12:38). Anyone who wanted Israel not to be redeemed died with the firstborn, as it is stated: “He smote all the firstborn in Egypt” (Psalms 78:51). <br><b>“Pharaoh rose during the night, he, all his servants, and all of Egypt; and there was a great cry in Egypt, as there was no house in which there was no one dead” (Exodus 12:30).</b> <br>They all screamed, as it is stated: “There was a great cry in Egypt.” They all came to kill Pharaoh.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">They blamed him for what had happened.</i> At that moment, “the Egyptians urged the people, [to hastily send them from the land]” (Exodus 12:33). [The Israelites] were reciting <i>hallel</i>, and Pharaoh announced to his warriors: ‘Come, let us call Moses and Aaron.’ God said to him: ‘Will you expel My children at night? You will not expel My children at night, but rather they will depart overtly at noon.’ Israel dispersed throughout Egypt at that time, as it is stated: “The children of Israel acted in accordance with the word of Moses; and they asked from the Egyptians…” (Exodus 12:35). Moses was occupied with Joseph’s bones and the Tabernacle vessels that our patriarch Jacob had prepared.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob had prepared materials for use in the Tabernacle. See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 33:8. </i> So, [King] David said: “The righteous shall rejoice when he sees vengeance” (Psalms 58:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Israelites saw that their oppressors were being punished as they were being redeemed, and they rejoiced. </i>
“The children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Sukkot, approximately six hundred thousand men on foot, beside children” (Exodus 12:37).</b> <br>“The children of Israel journeyed from Rameses.” Rabbi Shmuel says: Once they departed, they baked the dough that they kneaded, as it is stated: “They baked the dough” (Exodus 12:39). <br><b>“It was at the end of four hundred and thirty years, it was on that very day that the entire host of the Lord departed from the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:41).</b> <br>“It was at the end of four hundred and thirty years” – from the moment that the decree was issued against them,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">When God told Abraham his descendants would experience servitude and affliction in a foreign land; see Genesis 15:13. </i> as they were in Egypt only two hundred and ten years. On the day that they descended to Egypt, on that very day [years later] they ascended [from Egypt], and on that very day Joseph had emerged from prison. Therefore, that night is a celebration for all Israel, as it is stated: “It was a night of vigil for the Lord” (Exodus 12:42). In this world, He performed a miracle for them at night, as it was a transient miracle;<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Israel would experience additional tragedies and suffering in the future. Thus, the redemption from Egypt was transient. </i> however, in the future, the night will turn into day, as it is stated: “The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold…” (Isaiah 30:26) – like the light that the Holy One blessed be He created initially, and He stored it in the Garden of Eden.
“It was a night of vigil for the Lord to take them out of the land of Egypt; it is a night for the Lord, a vigil for all the children of Israel throughout their generations” (Exodus 12:42).</b> <br>What did He see that led Him to call it a night of vigil [<i>shimurim</i>]? It is a night during which He performs great deeds for the righteous, just as He performed [great deeds] for Israel in Egypt. On that [night] He rescued Hezekiah, and on it He rescued Ḥananya and his counterparts, and on it He rescued Daniel from the lions’ den, and on it Messiah and Elijah the prophet will be exalted, as it is stated: “The watchman said: The morning comes, and also the night” (Isaiah 21:12). <br>This is analogous to a woman who was awaiting her husband who had embarked to a country overseas. He said to her. ‘Let this sign be for you. When you see this sign, know that I am coming, and I am coming soon.’ So, Israel has been waiting from the time that Edom arose.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Israel has been awaiting redemption since the time Edom, associated with Rome, arose and destroyed the Second Temple.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘This sign will be for you: On the day that I performed salvation for you, know that on that same night I will redeem you. If not, do not believe,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">If you see possible indications of the redemption but not on the aforementioned date, do not believe that they are real indications of redemption. </i> as the time has not yet come,’ as it is stated: “I, the Lord, in its time, I will hasten it” (Isaiah 60:22), and it says: “Another one, it is in a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth…I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms…” (Haggai 2:6, 22). Just as I overthrew Egypt, so I will overthrow the idolaters, as it is stated: “The nations will be devastated” (Isaiah 60:12), and it says: “To take hold of the ends of the earth [and shake the wicked out of it]” (Job 38:13).

Chapter 19

<b>“The Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the statute of the paschal offering; no foreigner shall eat of it” (Exodus 12:43).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the statute of the paschal offering” – that is what Scripture said: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul; and in its joy no stranger can meddle” (Proverbs 14:10). Why is it so? It is only that just as the heart senses the trouble that it experiences, so, too, when a person rejoices, the heart rejoices first, as it is stated: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul.” Likewise, David said: “My heart flutters, my strength fails me” (Psalms 38:11). In my joy, my heart rejoices first, as it is stated: “Therefore, my heart is glad and my glory rejoices” (Psalms 16:9), and so it says: “For my sighs are many and my heart is faint” (Lamentations 1:22). In the future, the Holy One blessed be He brings [relates to] all the limbs but first consoles only the heart, as it is stated: “I will speak to her heart” (Hosea 2:16). <br>Another interpretation: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul” – that is Hannah, who suffered greatly, as it is stated: “She was bitter of soul” (I Samuel 1:10); she, by herself.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hannah was barren but her husband had children by his other wife. </i> When she was remembered,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">When she bore a son.</i> God remembered her by herself, as it is stated: “And in its joy no stranger can meddle” (Proverbs 14:10); and it is written: “My heart exults in the Lord…because I rejoice in Your salvation” (I Samuel 2:1); I exulted by myself but no other will exult with me. <br>Another interpretation: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul” – that is the Shunamite woman. When? It was when her son died and she went to complain to Elisha. What is written? “Geḥazi came to push her away, but the man of God said: Release her, for her soul is bitter within her…” (II Kings 4:27). When he sent Geḥazi to revive her son and said to him: “Take my staff in your hand” (II Kings 4:29), the Shunamite said to him: ‘“By the life of the Lord and by your life” (II Kings 4:30), you abided in God’s mysteries. At first, you gave me a son; now, again abide in God’s mysteries, and revive him’ – that is: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul.” <br>Another interpretation: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul” – that is David. When he went down to Akhish<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Philistine king of Gath.</i> to assist him, he was there for three days, and the Amalekites came and took his [David’s] wives and his children captive and burned Tziklag, David began crying, as it is stated: “David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him” (I Samuel 30:6). They did not do so, but rather they rescued their wives, their sons, and their daughters and came to the Land of Israel and took up the Ark of the Lord and set it in its place. What is written there? “Also David the king rejoiced with great joy” (I Chronicles 29:9). <br>Another interpretation: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul” – that is Israel, who were subject to enslavement in Egypt. When they came to leave, and the Holy One blessed be He decreed for them to perform the paschal offering, the Egyptians came to eat with them. God said to them: Heaven forbid! “No foreigner shall eat of it;” that is: “The heart knows the bitterness of its soul; and in its joy no stranger can meddle.”
Another interpretation: “This is the statute of the paschal offering” – that is what Scripture states: “Let my heart be whole in Your statutes” (Psalms 119:80). David said: ‘Master of the universe, when I engage in Your statutes, let the evil inclination not have permission to look at me, as it is stated: “Teach me, Lord, Your way, I will walk in Your truth” (Psalms 86:11). [Do this] so that the evil inclination will not mislead me, and I will be ashamed before the righteous. Moreover, because it misleads me, I neglect the words of the Torah, and when I come to exhibit my learning before You and those who are lesser than I, they respond and say to me that it is not so, and I am ashamed. Rather, make my heart one, so it will engage in Torah wholely.’ That is what is written: “Let my heart be whole in Your statutes, so that I will not be put to shame” (Psalms 119:80). <br>Another interpretation: “Let my heart be whole in Your statutes” – these are the statute of the paschal offering, and the statute of the red heifer. Why? It is because they are similar to one another. About this [the paschal offering] it is stated: “This is the statute of the paschal offering,” about that [the red heifer] it is stated: “This is the statute of the Torah” (Numbers 19:2),<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This passage recounts the laws of the red heifer, whose ashes are used to purify a person from ritual impurity imparted by contact with a dead body.</i> and you cannot know which statute is greater than the other. It is analogous to two similar noblewomen who were walking together and looked the same. Which of them is greater than the other? It is the one who is accompanied by the other to her home, and the other walks behind her. So, regarding the paschal offering “statute” is stated and regarding the [red] heifer “statute” is stated. Which is greater? It is the heifer, as those who partake of the paschal offering need it, as it is stated: “They shall take for the impure from the ashes of the burning of the purification” (Numbers 19:17). That is: “No foreigner shall eat of it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands the foreigner to be a person who is ritually impure.</i>
Our Rabbis said: Moses did three things in which his judgment was [later] confirmed by the judgment of the Omnipresent. At Mount Sinai he expounded, saying: If Israel, who have not been designated [to hear divine] speech, He [nevertheless] said to them: “Do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15), I, who is designated [to hear divine] speech, is it not logical that I separate myself from woman? The Holy One blessed be He agreed with him, as it is stated: “But you, stand here with Me” (Deuteronomy 5:28). <br>The second he expounded in the Tent of Meeting, saying: If at Sinai, whose sanctity was limited only to the revelation at Sinai, I ascended only with permission, as it is stated: “The Lord called to him from the mountain saying” (Exodus 19:3), then how can I enter the Tent of Meeting, which is for the generations, unless the Holy One blessed be He summons me? He agreed with his judgment, as it is stated: “The Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:1). <br>The third he expounded regarding the statute of the paschal offering: When Israel made the calf, he said: If, regarding the paschal offering, which was a one-time observance in Egypt, He said to me: “This is the statute of the paschal offering: no foreigner shall [eat of it],” Israel, who worshipped idols [with the Golden Calf], can they receive the Torah? Immediately, “He broke them [the tablets] at the foot of the mountain” (Exodus 32:19).
Another interpretation: “This is the statute of the paschal offering [no foreigner shall eat of it]” – that is what is written: “The foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord shall not speak, saying: The Lord has separated me from His people” (Isaiah 56:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The verse quoted prohibits foreigners from partaking of the paschal offering. However, a later verse presents the possibility of that foreigner joining himself to Israel and then partaking of the offering: “When a stranger will reside with you, and will perform the paschal offering to the Lord, circumcise all his males, and then he may draw near and perform it; and he will be like a native of the land; and all uncircumcised shall not eat of it. There shall be one law for the native, and for the stranger who resides with you (Exodus 12:48–9).</i> Job said: “The stranger shall not spend the night outside” (Job 31:32). The Holy One blessed be He does not reject any creature, but rather, He accepts everyone. The gates open at all times, and anyone who seeks to enter may enter. That is why it says: “The stranger shall not spend the night outside,” corresponding to: “The stranger who is within your gates” (Deuteronomy 31:12). “I opened My doors to the road” (Job 31:32), [is said] of the Holy One blessed be He, that He tolerates His creations. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: Corresponding to whom did He say: “The stranger [<i>hager</i>] shall not spend the night outside” (Job 31:32)? Rather, converts [<i>gerim</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical word for stranger, <i>ger, </i>also means convert in Rabbinic Hebrew. </i> are destined to be priests serving in the Temple, as it is stated: “The stranger [<i>hager</i>] will join himself with them, and they will be appended to the house of Jacob” (Isaiah 14:1). Appended [<i>venispeḥu</i>] means nothing other than priesthood, as it is stated: “Append me [<i>sefaḥeni</i>], please, to one of the priestly watches” (I Samuel 2:36). They are destined to partake of the showbread, for their daughters will marry into the priesthood. <br>And so did Akilas the proselyte ask our Rabbis. He said to them: ‘That which is written: “He loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing” (Deuteronomy 10:18) – are all the promises that He promised to the stranger that He would give him food and clothing?’ One [of the Rabbis] said to him: ‘That is what Jacob, whose name is Israel, requested from the Holy One blessed be He: “…and will give me food to eat, and clothing to wear” (Genesis 28:20). You, who have come among us, it is not enough for you that you are like us, but it should be sufficient for you to be like Jacob, the firstborn of the Holy One blessed be He.’ Ultimately, you should not suppose that Jacob requested food and clothing. Rather, Jacob said: The Holy One blessed be He promised me that He will be with me, and that He will establish the world from me. When will I know that He is with me and that he is protecting me? When He establishes from me sons who are priests partaking of the showbread and wearing priestly vestments, as it is stated: “And will give me food to eat,” that is the showbread; and clothing to wear, those are the priestly vestments, as it is stated: “You shall clothe Aaron in the holy vestments” (Exodus 40:13). Here, too, “He loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing” – in other words, He provides children to the stranger who will eat showbread and wear priestly vestments. That is, “the stranger shall not spend the night outside.” <br>The Holy One blessed be He said: After all the honor that I am destined to accord to the penitents, you are complaining? That is: “The foreigner, who has joined himself to the Lord, shall not speak…” (Isaiah 56:3). Alternatively, “the foreigner…shall not speak” – that is what is written: “Sing and rejoice daughter of Zion” (Zechariah 2:14), and it is written: “Many nations will join themselves to the Lord” (Zechariah 2:15). The Holy One blessed be He said: If I say so about converts, all the more so about Zion and Israel. “The foreigner…shall not speak.” The Holy One blessed be He said to the converts: You are concerned because I disqualified you and said regarding the paschal offering: “No foreigner shall eat of it?” Why don’t you ask the Givonites how I acted favorably to them? They are people who behaved deceitfully; acting out of fear [they] approached My children and took an oath to them. [Nevertheless,] what did I do to Saul and his household because he sought to kill them [the Givonites]?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See II Samuel 21:1 and <i>Yevamot</i> 78b. </i> They [the Givonites] killed seven of his descendants, as it is stated: “The king took the two sons of Ritzpa…and the five sons of Mikhal” (II Samuel 21:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">These descendants of Saul were handed over to the Givonites to be executed.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: If regarding the Givonites, who were Emorites, who acting out of fear behaved deceitfully with Israel, I accepted them, acted favorably to them, and I gave them satisfaction from My children; the converts who come in love, and serve for the sake of My name, won’t I accept them and exalt them? <br>Therefore, “the foreigner, who has joined himself to the Lord shall not say” (Isaiah 56:3) – these are the circumcised converts. The idolaters, however, have uncircumcised hearts, for thus the Holy One blessed be He disqualifies those with uncircumcised hearts and takes them down to Gehenna, as it is stated: “Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and take them down” (Ezekiel 32:18). Likewise, Isaiah says: “Therefore, the grave expanded itself, and opened its mouth without measure [<i>ḥok</i>]” (Isaiah 5:14) – for an idolater who scorns the statute [<i>ḥok</i>] of circumcision, as it is stated: “He established it for Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant” (Psalms 105:10). Israel, who are circumcised, do not go down to Gehenna. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: In order that the heretics and the wicked of Israel will not say: ‘Since we are circumcised, we will not descend to Gehenna,’ what does the Holy One blessed be He do? He sends an angel who extends their foreskin [rendering them uncircumcised] and they descend to Gehenna, as it is stated: “He extended his hands…profaned his covenant.” (Psalms 55:21). When Gehenna sees that the foreskin is connected to them, it opens its mouth and consumes them in fire; that is: “And opened its mouth without measure [<i>ḥok</i>].”
“This is the statute of the paschal offering.” Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: When Israel departed from Egypt, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Caution Israel regarding the mitzva of the paschal offering: “no foreigner shall eat of it, but anyone’s servant, bought for silver, you shall circumcise him – [then he shall eat of it].”’ When Israel saw that He disqualified the uncircumcised to partake of the paschal offering, all Israel quickly stood and circumcised all their slaves and children and everyone who would come out with them, as it is stated: “The children of Israel went and did [as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron; so they did]” (Exodus 12:50). It is analogous to a king who made a feast for all those he loved. The king said: ‘If on one of the participants there is no emblem, he may not enter here.’ So, God made a feast for them: “Roasted in fire, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs” (Exodus 12:8), because He redeemed them from their distress. He said to them: ‘If the seal of Abraham is not in your flesh, you may not taste from it.’ Everyone who was born in Egypt was quickly circumcised. About them it is stated: “Gather My pious together to Me; those who make My covenant with an offering” (Psalms 50:5). <br>Our Rabbis said: Israel did not seek to circumcise in Egypt; in fact, they all abolished circumcision in Egypt, except for the tribe of Levi, as it is stated: “And of Levi he said: Your Tumim [wholeheartedness] and Your Urim [lights] (Deuteronomy 33:8).”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is interpreting the meaning of the names of the Urim and Tumim, which were bequeathed to the tribe of Levi in Moses’s final blessing. </i> Why? It is because “they observed Your word and kept Your covenant” (Deuteronomy 33:9) in Egypt. The Holy One blessed be He sought to redeem them [Israel] but they had no merit. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He called Moses and said: ‘Go and circumcise them.’ Some say that it was Joshua who was there and circumcised them, as it is stated: “And again circumcise the children of Israel, a second time” (Joshua 5:2). <br>Many of them did not accept upon themselves to be circumcised. The Holy One blessed be He said that they [the children of Israel] should perform the paschal offering. Once Moses performed the paschal offering, the Holy One blessed be He made a decree for the four winds of the world that blow in the Garden of Eden. The winds went from the Garden of Eden and cleaved to that paschal offering, as it is stated: “Awake, north [wind], and come, south [wind]” (Song of Songs 4:16). Its aroma went a distance of forty days [travel]. All of Israel gathered near Moses, they said to him: ‘Please, feed us from your paschal offering,’ because they were famished from the aroma. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you will not be circumcised you will not eat,’ as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the statute of the paschal offering…[circumcise him, then he shall eat of it]” (Exodus 12:43–4). Immediately, they submitted and were circumcised, and the blood of the paschal offering and the blood of the circumcision intermingled, and the Holy One blessed be He would pass and take each of them, kiss him and bless him, as it is stated: “And I passed over you, and saw you wallowing in your blood [<i>damayikh</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Damayikh </i>is plural, indicating that there was more than one type of blood.</i> [and I said to you: In your blood, you shall live; I said to you: In your blood, you shall live]” (Ezekiel 16:6); live with the blood of the paschal offering, live with the blood of circumcision.
“No foreigner shall eat of it” – to fulfill what is stated: “He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances unto Israel” (Psalms 147:19). The Holy One blessed be He said to them that they should not intermingle with another nation, and they should not know its secrets, but rather you shall remain by yourselves. In this world, when Israel partook of the paschal offering, they ate it hastily, as it is stated: “So you shall eat it…[and you shall eat it hastily]” (Exodus 12:11), commemorating: “For in haste you departed from the land of Egypt” (Deuteronomy 16:3). However, in the future: “For you shall not go out hastily, and you shall not go in flight” (Isaiah 52:12). To what is this matter comparable? To a merchant who came to stay at an inn. He stayed there all day, and at night, he arose and took everything that was his and set out on the way. The innkeeper arose in the morning and began screaming: ‘Look – this merchant arose at night and took everything that was mine and departed!’ That merchant heard and said: ‘What caused me to hear this? It is only because I departed at night. Therefore, I swear that I will no longer depart at night.’ So, Israel prepared themselves at night, to leave early in the morning. The Egyptians arose after they went and said: ‘Let us pursue them, because they took everything that was ours,’ as it is stated: “The Egyptians pursued them” (Exodus 14:9). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘What caused you all this? It is the haste in which you departed. From now on, “for you shall not go out hastily.”’ In the past, I and My court would go before them, as it is stated: “The Lord went before them by day [in a pillar of cloud, to guide them on the way, and by night in a pillar of fire…]” (Exodus 13:21). However, in the future, it will be I alone, as it is stated: “For the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard” (Isaiah 52:12).
<b>“Consecrate to Me every firstborn; the first issue of any womb among the children of Israel, whether man or animal, is Mine” (Exodus 13:2).</b> <br> “Consecrate to Me every firstborn” – Rabbi Natan says: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Just as I made Jacob the firstborn, as it is stated: “Israel is My firstborn son” (Exodus 4:22), so I will make the messianic king the firstborn, as it is stated: “I also will appoint him firstborn” (Psalms 89:28). So, “consecrate to Me every firstborn.”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is explaining that the superfluous word “every” teaches that there is another firstborn who will be consecrated in the future – the messiah. </i> Caution Israel, just as I created the world and I said to Israel to remember the Sabbath day to commemorate the act of Creation, as it is stated: “Remember the Sabbath day,” (Exodus 20:8), so you should remember the miracles that I performed on your behalf in Egypt, and remember the day that you departed from there, as it is stated: “Remember this day that you departed from Egypt” (Exodus 13:3). Why? “Because with strength of hand the Lord took you from Egypt” (ibid.).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash has “took you from Egypt.” The actual verse is “took you from this.”</i> <br>“No leaven shall be seen with you [in all your borders] for seven days” (Deuteronomy 16:4), corresponding to the seven days between the redemption and the splitting of the Red Sea. Just as initially there were seven days of Creation and just as Shabbat takes place once every seven days, so shall these seven days be observed each and every year, as it is stated: “You shall observe this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year” (Exodus 13:10). It is analogous to a king who married a woman who was overseas.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The marriage took place remotely, while she was still abroad.</i> Waves reached her [i.e. she encountered a storm] before she came to him. He said to her: ‘Do not remember all the waves that passed over you, but rather, on that day that you were spared from them, remember me and make a celebration every year.’ So with regard to Israel, the Holy One blessed be He appeared to them to redeem them, and some harsh waves passed over them, but He provided salvation for them. That is why He cautioned them that they should celebrate every year, as it is stated: “Rejoice in the Lord, and be glad, righteous ones” (Psalms 32:11).
Another interpretation: “Consecrate to Me every firstborn” – Rabbi Neḥemya says: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘When you come to the land, transfer “the first issue of the womb to Me”’ (Exodus 34:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">In Exodus 13:11–12 it says: “When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and to your forefathers, and He shall give it you, you shall transfer the first issue of the womb to the Lord.”</i> Could it be that they should not transfer it immediately?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Does the mitzva of the consecration of the firstborn begin only once they enter the Land?</i> The verse states: “You shall transfer the first issue of the womb to the Lord.” The Holy One blessed be He cautioned them [to consecrate the firstborn] immediately because He had spared them in Egypt. <br> <b>“And when your son asks you tomorrow, saying: What is this? You shall say to him: With strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, the house of bondage” (Exodus 13:14).</b> <br>“And when your son asks you tomorrow” – inform him of the miracles that were performed on your behalf in Egypt when Pharaoh resisted letting you go, as it is stated: “It was when Pharaoh resisted” (Exodus 13:15). Make it a sign on your hand and on your head, as it is stated: “It will be a sign on your hand, [and as an ornament between your eyes] (Exodus 13:16). It is analogous to a king who made a great celebration for his daughter who had been taken by enemies. Her father said to her: ‘Make the same celebration that I made for you: A crown on your head, so that you will not forget it.’ So, God performed miracles on Israel’s behalf, and for their sake killed the firstborn of Egypt. He therefore cautioned them regarding the sanctity of the firstborn, who he had killed with His own hands, as it is stated: “The Lord smote every firstborn” (Exodus 12:29). There should be a crown<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Phylacteries.</i> on the head of Israel so that they never forget the miracle. <br>

Chapter 20

<b>“It was when Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them via the land of the Philistines, although is was near, as God said: Lest the people reconsider when they see war and return to Egypt” (Exodus 13:17).</b> <br> “It was when Pharaoh let the people go” – that is what the verse says: “A whip for the horse, and a bridle for the donkey” (Proverbs 26:3). “A whip for the horse,” this is the first Pharaoh, as it is stated: “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh…over the matter of Sarai, Abram’s wife” (Genesis 12:17). Why does the verse state: “Abram’s wife”? “Two are better than one” (Ecclesiastes 4:9),<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh was struck due to the merit of both Abraham and Sarah. </i> and it says: “He was good to Abram for her sake” (Genesis 12:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This demonstrates that the miracle was due to Abraham’s merit as well as Sarah’s merit. </i> <br>“A bridle for the donkey,” this was Avimelekh. When? “As the Lord had closed all the wombs of the house of Avimelekh” (Genesis 20:18). He began praising himself and saying: “In the innocence of my heart and the cleanliness of my hands I did this” (Genesis 20:5). [God responded:] “I withheld you from sinning against Me” (Genesis 20:6). To what is this matter comparable? It is comparable to a donkey upon which a person was riding, which saw a baby in the street. He jumped over it and did not harm it. They began praising the donkey that jumped over the baby and did not harm it. Its owner said to them: ‘By your lives, were it not for me who pulled [it away with] the bridle in its mouth, it would have harmed it.’ Similarly, they said: ‘Avimelekh was upright that he did not draw near to Sarah.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘He sought to do so, but I did not allow him to do so, and it was I who pulled him [away], as it is stated: “Lord, do not grant the desires of the wicked” (Psalms 140:9). That is why it says: “A bridle for the donkey.” <br> “A staff for the back of fools” (Proverbs 26:3) – this is Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Since they were devastated with the plagues, they freed Israel against their will, as it is stated: “It was when Pharaoh let [the people] go.” [The story of] Avimelekh, to what is it comparable? It is to one who entered the king’s palace and took his treasure chest in the dark. He went out and was apprehended. The king said to him: ‘What is in your hand?’ He was afraid. He said to him: ‘Why are you afraid? Did you take something from the palace?’ He said: ‘No.’ ‘What is this treasure chest? Who gave it to you?’ So, Avimelekh said before God: “Will you also kill a righteous nation?” (Genesis 20:4). [Avimelekh] said to Him: ‘You know that I did not touch her.’ [God] said to him: ‘And what is a man’s wife doing with you? Now send her away, as she is a married woman.’ “Behold, you will die, because of the woman whom you have taken…return the man's wife, as he is a prophet, and he will pray for you (Genesis 20:3,7). <br>What is “and he will pray for you”? It is analogous to a head of state who sent his slave to the judge [so the judge would] flog him. He began pleading to the judge. The judge said to him: ‘You did nothing to me, let your master say so and I will let you alone.’ So, God said: ‘Abraham entrusted his grievance to Me last night, and I dictated that I “execute justice for the oppressed” (Psalms 146:7) and you oppressed him. If he prays for you I will leave you alone,’ as it is stated: “And he will pray for you and you will live” (Genesis 20:7). <br>“And a bridle for the donkey” – [the story of] Pharaoh, to what is it comparable? It is [comparable] to a certain herdsman who would herd pigs. He found one sheep and took it among them. Its owner [who was the king,] sent to him and said: ‘Give me my sheep.’ He said to him: ‘You have no sheep with me.’ The owner said [to his servants]: ‘Inform me from where he waters his animals.’ They went and informed him, and he sealed the springs. He said to him: ‘Send me my sheep.’ He said to him: ‘You have no sheep with me.’ The owner said: ‘Inform me where he rests his animals.’ They went and informed him, and he destroyed the pens. He said to him: ‘Send me my sheep.’ He said to him: ‘You have no sheep with me.’ The owner said: ‘Inform me where he grazes [his animals].’ They went and informed him, and he burned all the grass that he had. He said to him: ‘Send me my sheep.’ He said to him: ‘You have no sheep with me.’ He said: ‘Inform me where his son goes to school.’ He went and abducted his son. He said to him: ‘Send me my sheep.’ He said to him: ‘Here is your sheep.’ <br>He was herding [his pigs] and then [the king] incarcerated him with his son. He said to him: ‘Now your sheep is no longer with me, why are you incarcerating me? What else do I have of yours?’ He said to him: ‘I demand of you everything to which it gave birth, and its shearings all the days that it was in your possession.’ He began screaming and saying: ‘If only I had not given it to you, and people would say [about me:] He stood by his word and did not send it to him, and it was [the king] who sought to kill him.’ <br>So, the king [in the parable] is the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, the sheep is Israel, the pig herdsman is Pharaoh. Israel descended to Egypt and [Pharaoh] imposed taxes upon them, as it is stated: “They imposed upon them taskmasters” (Exodus 1:11), and it says: “Every son that is born [you shall cast him into the river]” (Exodus 1:22). The Holy One blessed be He began saying to Moses, to say to Pharaoh: “Let My people go, and they will serve Me” (Exodus 7:16). He went and said it to him. [Pharaoh] began saying: “Who is the Lord that I should heed His voice?” (Exodus 5:2). Moses began and said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘He is saying “who is the Lord” and does not wish to let them go.’ [God] said to him: ‘Where does Egypt drink?’ He said to Him: ‘From the Nile.’ He said to him: ‘Transform it into blood.’ He said: ‘I cannot transform it. Is there a person who drinks from a well who throws a stone into it?’ He said to him: ‘Let Aaron go and turn it [into blood].’ Aaron went and struck it and it turned into blood. Why did Moses not strike it? He said: ‘I was thrown into it and it did not harm me.’ That is why Aaron struck it. The Egyptians began seeking [water] to drink but were unable to find any. <br>He again said: ‘Let My people go,’ but [Pharaoh] did not wish to do it. [God] said to [Moses]: ‘Where do his animals graze?’ [Moses responded:] ‘In the wilderness.’ He sent hail upon them and broke every tree of theirs and burned everything, as it is stated: “There was hail, and fire flaming…” (Exodus 9:24). Then he sent locusts against them, which ate all the vegetation on the trees, and he took his staff and burned <beheaded> all the animals, as it is stated: “Behold, the hand of the Lord [is upon your livestock… a very severe pestilence]” (Exodus 9:3). He brought upon him all the plagues, but he did not want to let them go. Then He took his son and incarcerated him, as it is stated: “The Lord smote every firstborn” (Exodus 12:29). At that moment, he said: “Arise and depart” (Exodus 12:31). <br> [Pharaoh] pursued them, and [God] seized him and incarcerated him alongside his son, as it is stated: “He tossed Pharaoh and his army into the sea” (Psalms 136:15). Pharaoh began saying: ‘If only I had not let them go, and [people] would say: See, a man who stood by his word, [for now even though I have] let them go, He is killing me; that is: “A staff for the back of fools.” Why does it say “staff” in their regard? It is because all the first plagues did not affect them until He brought the boils upon them. Once they were afflicted [by boils], they said to each other: ‘This is a harsh plague.’ The expression “staff” means nothing other than boils, as Job says: “Let Him remove His staff from upon me” (Job 9:34).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job had been struck by boils – see Job 2:7. </i> That is why it is stated: “A staff for the back of fools.” Pharaoh said: ‘My people were stricken and He killed my son and his children are departing.’ Once he let them go, he began crying: ‘Woe, woe [<i>vai vai</i>]’– that is: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when Pharaoh let the people go.”
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let the people go” – that is what is written: “So said the Lord of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed…their Redeemer is mighty, the Lord of hosts is His name” (Jeremiah 50:33–34). To what is this matter analogous? [It is analogous] to a person who had an orchard. Another said to him: ‘Sell me this orchard.’ He sold it to him for a <i>maneh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">One hundred dinar.</i> but the owner of the orchard had not known what was in it. They said to him: ‘For how much did you sell the orchard?’ He said to them: ‘For a <i>maneh</i>.’ They said to him: ‘It has one hundred <i>maneh</i> of olive trees, one hundred <i>maneh</i> of grapevines, one hundred <i>maneh</i> of pomegranate trees, varieties of spices worth one hundred <i>maneh</i>, and likewise, each and every species worth one hundred <i>maneh</i>.’ They said to him: ‘Did you not know what you were selling, and what was in the orchard?’ “Henna with spikenard plants, spikenard and saffron” (Song of Songs 4:13–14); had the buyer acquired only the springs that were in it, it would have sufficed, as it is stated: “A spring of gardens, a well of spring water, and flowing streams from Lebanon” (Song of Songs 4:15). The seller began regretting [his sale]. <br>So it was with Pharaoh. When he let Israel go, they were of no value to him. His senior advisers said to him: ‘What have you done? If they had only the loot, that would suffice for them,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Even if only for the objects that they borrowed from the Egyptians (see Exodus 12:35–6), that would be enough for their return to be a national priority. </i> as it is stated: “A mixed multitude, too, ascended with them, [and flocks and herds, even very much cattle]” (Exodus 12:38). Moreover, numerous wealthy people were among them, numerous wise men and numerous artisans, as it is stated: “Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates” (Song of Songs 4:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Just as pomegranates are full of seeds, Israel is full of valuable assets. </i> There were numerous men, women, and children. It is stated: “And all their captors held them, [they refused to let them go]” (Jeremiah 50:33). What is written thereafter? “Their Redeemer is mighty, the Lord of hosts is His name” (Jeremiah 50:34). At that moment<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">When his advisors said: “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?” (Exodus 14:5). </i> [Pharaoh] began crying: “Woe, woe [<i>vai vai</i>].” “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when Pharaoh let [the people] go.”
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let the people go” – that is what is written: “He sends His command to earth” (Psalms 147:15). Woe is the wicked, as they are maggots and worms and [will be] eliminated from the world, yet they seek to abrogate the word of the Holy One blessed be He. He said to them: ‘You said: “And I will not let Israel go” (Exodus 5:2), but I said: “Let My people go” (Exodus 5:1) – let us see whose word stands and whose word is void.’ Ultimately, Pharaoh himself arose, went, and fell at the feet of Moses, and said to Israel: “Arise and depart” (Exodus 12:31). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘What then, Pharaoh, did your word stand, or My word?’ That is why it is stated: “He sends His command to earth.” When? “It was when Pharaoh let the people go.” <br>Did Pharaoh let them go? Bilam said: “God, who took them out of Egypt” (Numbers 24:8), and here it says: “It was when Pharaoh let the people go”? Rather, it teaches that Pharaoh was accompanying them, and saying to them: ‘Pray and beg for mercy for me,’ as it is stated: “Take both your flocks and your herds, as you said, and go; and bless me, too” (Exodus 12:32). Letting them go [<i>shiluaḥ</i>] stated here means nothing other than accompaniment, as it is stated: “Abraham went with them to see them off [<i>leshalleḥam</i>]” (Genesis 18:16).
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let the people go” – the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I wrote in the Torah: “You shall let the mother go, and take the young for yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:7), and you let the fathers go but you had cast the sons into the Nile. I, too, will cast you into the sea and eliminate you, as it is stated: “He tossed Pharaoh and his army into the sea” (Psalms 136:15), but I will take your daughter and I will bequeath her the Garden of Eden.’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh’s daughter had saved Moses from the Nile; see Exodus 2:5–6. </i>
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let the people go” – that is what is written: “Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates” (Song of Songs 4:13). Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to one who had a field in which there was a pile of pebbles. He arose and sold it to another. The person who bought it arose and removed the pile from it and found spring water beneath it. He planted grapevines in rows, planted various spices, planted pomegranate trees, and suspended them on reeds. He constructed a tower and positioned a guard in it. Everyone who passed by it would praise it. The person who sold it passed by it and saw that it was filled with everything good; he said: ‘Woe is me that I sold it that way, woe is me that I divested it in this way.’ <br>So, too, Israel in Egypt was like a pile [<i>gal</i>] of pebbles, as it is stated: “A locked garden is my sister, my bride; a locked fountain [<i>gal</i>], a sealed spring” (Song of Songs 4:12). Once they departed, they became a pomegranate orchard, as it is stated: “Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates.” They became like a grapevine, as it is stated: “He transported a vine from Egypt” (Psalms 80:9). They formed rows [by tribe]: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, and the rest of them. He planted various types of spices, as it is stated: “Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon” (Song of Songs 4:14).” He planted apples in it, as it is stated: “Under the apple tree I awakened you” (Song of Songs 8:5). He suspended it on reeds, these are the branches of the Candelabrum. He found in it spring water, as it is stated: “A spring of gardens, a well of spring water” (Song of Songs 4:15). He built a tower in it, as it is stated: “And built a tower in its midst, and also hewed out a winepress” (Isaiah 5:2). He situated a guard in it, as it is stated: “The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shadow on your right hand” (Psalms 121:5). <br>All the days that people would see Israel, they would praise them. Who was praising them? The wicked Bilam, as it is stated: “How goodly are your tents, Jacob…like valleys outstretched” (Numbers 24:5–6). Bilam saw them and was astounded. Pharaoh saw them in rows of priests, Levites, and Israelites, and divided into flags. He began screaming and said: ‘Woe is that man<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to Pharaoh himself. </i> who let this [great nation] out from his auspices’ – therefore it is stated: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when Pharaoh let the people go.”
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let the people go” – that is what is written: “Our soul, like a bird, has escaped from the snare of the trappers” (Psalms 124:7). This is analogous to a dove that was sitting in its nest. A wicked serpent saw it and sought to ascend to it. It fled from it to another place. [The serpent] ascended and sat in its nest. The nest caught fire and the serpent was burned. The bird flew and sat on the roof. When the serpent and the nest were burned, they said to the bird: ‘How long will you fly from place to place?’ It went and found itself a fine, excellent nest and settled in it. <br>So it was for Israel in Egypt. Pharaoh the serpent was seeking to outsmart them, as it is stated: “Come, let us deal wisely with them” (Exodus 1:10), and he is likened to a serpent, as it is stated: “Prophesy concerning Pharaoh, the great serpent.”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is a paraphrase of Ezekiel 29:2-3. </i> Israel fled from him, as it is stated: “They will come trembling like a bird from Egypt” (Hosea 11:11). When Israel departed from Egypt, Pharaoh was burned in fire, as it is stated: “You send your wrath, it consumes them like straw” (Exodus 15:7). Israel settled in a different place, as it is stated: “I have become like a bird alone on the roof” (Psalms 102:8). Then they fled like a bird from place to place, as it is stated: “Like a bird that wanders from its nest, so is a man who wanders from his place” (Proverbs 27:8). When they came to the Land of Israel, they found a nest, as it is stated: “The bird, too, has found a house” (Psalms 84:4). Likewise, David said: “Until I find a place for the Lord, a dwelling place for the Mighty of Jacob” (Psalms 132:5). That is why it says: “Our soul, like a bird, has escaped.”
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let [the people] go” – when Pharaoh let the people go, who shouted woe? It was Pharaoh. It is analogous to a king whose son was going to a certain province. He went and stayed with a certain wealthy person. The wealthy person received the king’s son generously. When the king heard who had received his son, and in what province he was, he sent a letter to that man and said to him: ‘Send my son [to me.’ He sent this letter] once, twice, three times; he would send all the time, and each and every hour, until he went and took his son himself. That man began shouting because the king’s son left his house. His neighbors said to him: ‘Why are you screaming?’ He said to them: ‘I was honored when the king’s son was with me, as the king would write a letter to me, and he needed me, and I enjoyed his respect. Now that the king’s son has been taken from me, he does not need me for anything. That is why I am screaming.’ <br>So, too, Pharaoh said: ‘When Israel was with me, the Holy One blessed be He needed me, and I enjoyed His respect. He would send me a letter all the time, and say: “So said the Lord, God of the Hebrews: Let My people go”’ (Exodus 9:1). Pharaoh would hear from Moses: “Let My son go,” but he did not seek to let them go. When the Holy One blessed be He descended to Egypt and took Israel out, as it is stated: “I descended to deliver it from the hand of Egypt” (Exodus 3:8), Pharaoh began screaming: ‘Woe is me that I let Israel go’– therefore, it says: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when Pharaoh let [the people] go.”
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let [the people] go” – who said woe? Moses said woe. It is analogous to one who became the groomsman for the king’s daughter. He saw in the stars that he would take her out of her father’s house but would not come with her to the groom’s house, to her wedding canopy. He began crying. They said to him: ‘Why are you crying?’ He said to them: ‘I am crying because I exerted myself to take her out, but I am not coming with her to her wedding canopy.’ So, Moses said: ‘I am crying because I exerted myself to take Israel out of Egypt, but I will not enter the Land with them’ – that is why: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when Pharaoh let [the people] go.”
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let [the people] go” – this is analogous to one who found a bundle of pearls, and he did not know what he had in his possession. He said to a particular [individual] on the road: ‘Would you like to take this bundle that is in my possession?’ He said to him: ‘Why should I take your bundle?’ He said to him: ‘Take it and I will not stand in your way,’ and he took it from him. When he entered the city, he sat and strung together the large ones separately, the small ones separately, and the medium ones separately. The one who had given him the bundle entered the city and saw that the man who had taken it from him was displaying them outside. A person came to purchase from him and said to him: ‘How much is this small one?’ He said: ‘[Its price is] one million.’ ‘And how much is the large one?’ He said to him: ‘Ten million.’ ‘And how much is the medium one?’ He said to him: ‘Eight million.’ When he saw that, he tore his garments. He said: ‘All this wealth was in my possession and I divested myself of it for nothing. Woe is that man that he divested himself of it in that way.’ <br>So it was with Pharaoh; the bundle of pearls is Israel, who were under his auspices, as it is stated: “A bundle of myrrh my beloved is to me” (Song of Songs 1:13). He began screaming: “Arise and leave” (Exodus 12:31). Moses began counting them, six hundred thousand besides the tribe of Levi, whom he did not count. When Pharaoh saw all that population he began screaming ‘woe’ [<i>vai</i>]. That is: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when Pharaoh let [the people] go.”
Another matter, “it was when Pharaoh let the people go” – that is what is written: “Say to God: How awesome are your actions. Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies will dwindle before You” (Psalms 66:3). Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: Say to the good laborer: ‘Well done.’ How [astounding it is that] those who were [set to be] hanged, hang those who [would have] hanged them; those [set to be] executed, execute those who [would have] executed them. Haman thought to hang Mordekhai and they hanged him and his sons. Pharaoh said: “Every son that is born, you shall cast him into the river” (Exodus 1:22), and he was cast into the sea, as it is stated: “Pharaoh’s chariot and his host He cast into the sea” (Exodus 15:4). That is: “Say to God: How awesome are your actions.” <br>What is: “Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies will dwindle [<i>yekhaḥeshu</i>] before You”? Rabbi Berekhya said: Their words will render them liars, like the matter that is stated: “And he lies [<i>vekhiḥesh</i>] to his counterpart” (Leviticus 5:21). You find that Nebuchadnezzar said: “And the appearance of the fourth is like a son of gods” (Daniel 3:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya (known also by their Babylonian names, Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Abednego) were thrown into the fiery furnace, they were able to walk around in the flames without being harmed. Nebuchadnezzar described seeing them, as well as a fourth being, an angel. </i> What did the Holy One blessed be He do to him? He delivered him to the accusing angel, who began flogging him and saying to him: ‘Evil one from a putrid drop, say what you saw.’ He began saying: “Blessed be the God of Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Abednego, who sent His angel, and delivered His servants” (Daniel 3:28). [Son of gods] is not written but rather “His angel.” That is: “Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies will dwindle before You.” <br>And Nebuchadnezzar also said: “None can stay His hand [or say to Him: What have you done]” (Daniel 4:32). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one from a putrid drop, are you suggesting that I perform injustice against any person?’ [Nebuchadnezzar] then said: “For all His works are truth” (Daniel 4:34). That is: “Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies will dwindle before You.” Pharaoh, because he said: “Who is the Lord [that I should heed Him…?]” (Exodus 5:2), he then said: “The Lord is righteous” (Exodus 9:27). Because he said: “And I will not let Israel go” (Exodus 5:2), he circled among the entrances of the Israelites and said to them: ‘Go in peace, depart in peace’ – that is: “Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies will dwindle before You.”
“God did not lead them via the land [<i>derekh eretz</i>]” (Exodus 13:17) – he did not conduct himself in the standard manner [<i>kederekh kol haaretz</i>]. What is the standard manner? One who purchases slaves, purchases them so they will bathe him, smear him with oil, clothe him, transport him, and illuminate [the way] before him. But the Holy One blessed be He did not do this with Israel. Rather, God did not lead them in the standard manner, but He would bathe them, as it is stated: “I bathed you in water” (Ezekiel 16:9). He smeared oil on them, as it is stated: “I smeared them with oil” (Ezekiel 16:9). He clothed them, as it is stated: “I clothed you in embroidery” (Ezekiel 16:10). He transported them, as it is stated: “I bore you on eagles’ wings” (Exodus 19:4). He illuminated [the way] before them, as it is stated: “The Lord went before them by day…[to give them light]” (Exodus 13:21). That is why it is stated: “God did not lead them via the land [<i>derekh eretz</i>].” <br>“<God did not lead them via the land of the> Philistines.” Why? The tribe of Ephraim had erred and departed from Egypt before the appointed time, and three hundred thousand of them were killed. Why were they killed? It is because they calculated from the day that Abraham was spoken to [during the Covenant] between the Parts<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis chapter 15. In verses 13-14, Abraham is told that his descendants will be strangers in a foreign land, and will be afflicted for four hundred years, and then will emerge with great wealth. </i> and erred by thirty years, as it is stated: “The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow [that turned back on the day of battle; they did not keep the covenant of God]” (Psalms 78:9–10). Had it not been that they erred, they would not have departed, [for] who would desire to bring out his descendants to be killed, [as seemingly attributed to] Ephraim, as it is stated: “But Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the killer” (Hosea 9:13)? The Philistines killed them, as it is stated: “And the sons of Ephraim…Shutelaḥ… and the people of Gat killed them” (I Chronicles 7:20–21). Their bones were scattered along the way in piles, as it had already been thirty years from when they departed until their brethren departed from Egypt. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Were Israel to see the bones of the Ephraimites scattered on the way, they would return to Egypt.’ <br>To what is this matter comparable? It is to a king who married a woman and sought to go to his province. He sat her in a litter, but did not manage to enter the province until his wife died. He buried her at the entrance to the province. Then, he married her sister. The king said: ‘I will take her on a circuitous route so that she will not see her sister’s grave and return.’ What did he do? He took her on a circuitous route from the other side of the province. So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let them take a circuitous path so that they will not see the bones of their brethren scattered along the way and return to Egypt.’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He took the blood of the Ephraimites and, as it were, dipped His garments in them, as it is stated: “Why is Your garment red?” (Isaiah 63:2). The Holy One blessed be He said: I will not be consoled [<i>mitnaḥem</i>] until I take the vengeance of the Ephraimites, as it is stated: “God did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>].”
Another matter, “God did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>].” Although Pharaoh let them go, the Holy One blessed be He was not mollified. To what is this matter comparable? It is [comparable] to a king whose son was taken captive, and his father went to save him from the highwaymen, and he killed them. The son was saying to his father: ‘This and that they did to me, this is how they struck me and enslaved me.’ Even though he killed them, he would not be mollified; rather, he would say: ‘This and that they did to my son.’ So the Egyptians did; they enslaved Israel, as it is stated: “They embittered their lives” (Exodus 1:14). The Holy One blessed be He brought ten plagues upon them and redeemed His children. Nevertheless, He would say: I will not be mollified [<i>mitnaḥem</i>] until I kill all of them, as it is stated: “The Lord overturned Egypt in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:27), and it is written: “The horse and its rider He cast into the sea” (Exodus 15:1), and it is written: “Egypt shall be a desolation” (Joel 4:19); that is why it is stated: “…did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>].”
Another matter, “God did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>].” From Egypt to the Land of Israel there are eleven journeys.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Which can be conducted in eleven days.</i> Instead, the Holy One blessed be He bore them via the wilderness for forty years, as it is stated: “Eleven days from Ḥorev (Deuteronomy 1:2) and then: “It was in the fortieth year” (Deuteronomy 1:3). That is why it is stated: “God did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">God did not lead them in as quickly as possible to the Land of Israel and grant them rest [<i>menuḥa</i>] (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>). </i> Alternatively, “God did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>]” – this is analogous to a king who had children who were taken captive, and some of them died in captivity. The king descended and saved those who remained from them, and there was joy before him because he saved his children, but he would not be consoled [<i>mitnaḥem</i>] over those who died.
Another matter, “God did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>].” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: This is analogous to a king’s son who was taken captive by barbarians who enslaved him harshly. Sometime later, the king went and rescued his son from them. The king said to his son: ‘My son, I am glad that I recued you from them, but I will not be mollified until I enslave them as they enslaved you.’ So too, when Israel was in Egypt [the Egyptians] enslaved them with mortar and bricks. The Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself to them and saved them. There was joy before Him because He rescued them, [but] He said: ‘I will not be mollified until I drag them into the sea,’ as it is stated: “He tossed Pharaoh and his army into the sea” (Psalms 136:15). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: This is analogous to a king who had twelve sons and ten estates. The king said: ‘If I give them to my sons, I will cause a quarrel between them. Rather, I will wait until I acquire another two, and then I will distribute them between them.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I take them into the Land now, there will not be a portion for [each of] the twelve tribes. Rather, I will delay them in the wilderness until they conquer the east bank of the Jordan, and the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh will take it [as their portion], and then I will bring them into the Land.’ That is why it is stated: “God did not lead them.”
Another matter, “God did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>].” This is analogous to a king who had a son and he sought to bequeath him an inheritance, and he said: ‘If I give it to him now, he is still young and unable to retain it; rather, [I will wait] until my son learns the laws and appreciates their significance, and then I will give it to him.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I take Israel into the Land now, they have not yet engaged in the mitzvot, and they do not know the matters of <i>terumot </i> and tithes, Rather, I will give them the Torah and then I will take them into the Land.’
Another matter, “God did not lead them [<i>naḥam</i>].” Why [did God not lead them into the land immediately] via the land of the Philistines? Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the Canaanites heard that Israel would be entering the Land, they arose and chopped down the trees that they had.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">God did not want to bring Israel into a land barren of trees. Consequently, He delayed them in the wilderness. </i> When they [the Canaanites] heard that they [the Israelites] were being delayed in the wilderness for forty years, they believed that the wilderness would be their residence. They arose and planted trees and grew them, and then He took them into the Land. Our great rabbi<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> says: Because the Holy One blessed be He sought to put the fear of Israel in the idolaters. He delayed them in the wilderness forty years and [directed them on their path and] illuminated [it] for them with a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night. All the idolaters heard, and trembling beset them, as it is stated: “Terror and dread falls upon them” (Exodus 15:16), and what is written thereafter? “Bring them in and plant them” (Exodus 15:17).
<b>“God led the people around, via the wilderness by the Red Sea, and the children of Israel ascended armed [<i>ḥamushim</i>] from the land of Egypt” (Exodus 13:18).</b> <br>“God led the people around [<i>vayasev</i>].” Like a merchant who purchased a cow as property,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">For domestic purposes rather than for slaughter. </i> and his house was near a slaughterhouse. He said: ‘If I take it on the path to my house, it will see the slaughterhouse and the blood and it will flee. Rather, I will take it on an alternative path.’ So too, the residents of Gaza and Ashkelon and the entire land of the Philistines were destined to confront Israel when they departed from Egypt. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Israel should not see the war and return to Egypt,’ as it is stated: “Lest the people reconsider when they see war, and return to Egypt” (Exodus 13:17). What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He took them on an alternative route, as it is stated: “God led the people around.”
What is “led the people around [<i>vayasev</i>]”? The Holy One blessed be He encompassed them, just as He says: “I will be for it, the utterance of the Lord, a wall of fire around” (Zechariah 2:9) – like a shepherd who was herding his flock and saw wolves coming to attack the flock, and he encircled the flock so they would not be harmed. So too, when Israel departed from Egypt, there were chieftains of Edom, Moav, and Canaan standing and giving counsel [as to] how to come and attack Israel. When the Holy One blessed be He saw that it was so, He encircled [Israel] so they would not come and attack them, as it is stated: “God led the people around [<i>vayasev</i>].” Not only in this world, but so it will be in the World to Come. From where [is this derived?] It is as David says: “Jerusalem, mountains surround it and the Lord surrounds His people” (Psalms 125:2). Alternatively, “God led the people around [<i>vayasev</i>]” – from here our Rabbis said: “Even the poor of Israel may not eat until he reclines [<i>yasev</i>]” (Mishna <i>Pesaḥim</i> 10:1) as that is what the Holy One blessed be He did to them, as it is stated: “God led [the people] around [<i>vayasev</i>].”
“The children of Israel ascended <i>ḥamushim</i>,” – they ascended armed. <br> <b>“Moses took Joseph’s bones with him, as he had administered an oath to the children of Israel, saying: 'God will remember you; and you shall take my bones up with you from here’” (Exodus 13:19).</b> <br>“Moses took Joseph’s bones.” In his regard the verse says: “The wise hearted will take commandments” (Proverbs 10:8), as all Israel were engaged with silver and gold and Moses was engaged with Joseph’s bones, as it is stated: “Moses took [Joseph’s] bones….” The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: In your regard, “the wise hearted will take commandments” is fulfilled. Joseph was obligated to his father to bury him because he was his son, but you are not his son and not his grandson, and you were not obligated to involve yourself with him, and [yet] you [have involved yourself in] his burial. Likewise, I, who have no obligation to any creature, I will tend to you and bury you, as it is stated: “He buried him in the canyon” (Deuteronomy 34:6). <br>How did Moses know where Joseph was buried? Some say, Seraḥ daughter of Asher showed him, and he was buried in the Nile. What did Moses do?…<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash elsewhere (<i>Tanḥuma</i> (Warsaw ed.), <i>Beshalaḥ</i> 2) describes how Moses cast a shard, on which “arise bull” was written, into the Nile, in order to elevate Joseph’s remains from the riverbed. In Moses’s final blessing, Joseph was described as the “firstborn bull” (Deuteronomy 33:17). He called to him to rise to the surface, and not delay the exodus from Egypt.</i> Some say he was buried in the palace, in the manner that kings are buried. The Egyptians crafted golden dogs through sorcery, so if a person would come there they would bark and their voices would carry throughout the land of Egypt, a distance of forty days travel. Moses silenced them, as it is stated: “But for all of the children of Israel no dog will extend its tongue” (Exodus 11:7). Moses began screaming: ‘Joseph, Joseph, the time has arrived for what you said: “The Lord will remember you” (Genesis 50:25).’ Immediately, the coffin began rocking and Moses took it, as it is stated: “Moses took Joseph’s bones.” <br>Joseph’s bones travelled with them in the wilderness for forty years. The Holy One blessed be He said to [Joseph]: ‘You said to your brothers: “I will sustain you” (Genesis 50:21) – by your life, you will die and your bones will travel with them in the wilderness for forty years,’ as it is stated: “There were men who were impure by reason of a corpse [<i>nefesh adam</i>]” (Numbers 9:6), and <i>adam </i> refers to none other than Joseph, as it is stated: “He pitched a tent among men [<i>adam</i>]” (Psalms 78:60), and it is written: “He abhorred the tent of Joseph” (Psalms 78:67).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the tent referred to earlier as “among men [<i>adam</i>]” was in the territory of Joseph, indicating that Joseph is referred to as <i>adam</i>. Consequently, it may be determined that the individuals to whom the verse in Numbers 9:6 refers were those who carried Joseph’s coffin. It was their complaint that led to God’s command that one who is impure from a corpse, and therefore cannot bring the paschal offering, may do so one month later as the ‘minor <i>Pesaḥ</i>.’ </i> ‘Thanks to your bones they perform the minor<i> Pesaḥ</i>.’ <br>“As he [Joseph] had administered an oath [<i>hashbe’a hishbia</i>] to the children of Israel” – why twice? It is because he took an oath that he had no grudge against them, and they took an oath to him that they held no grudge against him. Why [does the verse state:] “you shall take my bones up with you from here”? Rabbi Levi said: To what is this matter comparable? It is to a man who put his wine in the cellar. Thieves entered, took the barrel, and went and drank it. The owner of the wine came and found that they had stolen the barrel. He said to them: ‘You drank the wine, restore the barrel to its place.’ So too, Joseph’s brothers abducted him and sold him, and when [the time] came to take his leave from the world, he administered an oath to them. He said to them: ‘Please, my brothers, you abducted me alive from Shekhem, restore my bones to Shekhem.’ That is why it is stated: “The bones of Joseph that the children of Israel took out of Egypt, they buried in Shekhem” (Joshua 24:32).

Chapter 21

“<b>The Lord said to Moses: ‘Why are you crying out to Me? Speak to the children of Israel and have them set forth’” (Exodus 14:15).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: ‘Why are you crying out to Me?’” That is what is written: “They cried out and the Lord heard” (Psalms 34:18). Why is this so? Isaac bequeathed two inheritances to his two sons: He bequeathed the voice to Jacob, as it says: “The voice is the voice of Jacob” (Genesis 27:22). He bequeathed the hands to Esau, as it is stated: “But the hands are the hands of Esau” (Genesis 27:22). Esau was proud of his inheritance, as it is stated: “Edom said to him: 'You shalt not pass through me, lest with a sword [I will come out against you’]” (Numbers 20:18). Jacob was proud of his inheritance, as it is stated: “We cried out to the Lord, God of our fathers” (Deuteronomy 26:7). In the future, both of them will receive their rewards. Esau will receive his reward, as it is stated: “As My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; behold, it will descend upon Edom” (Isaiah 34:5). Jacob will receive his reward, as it is stated: “The voice of gladness, the voice of joy” (Jeremiah 33:11). This is why it is written: “They cried out and the Lord heard,” because the children of Israel cried out at the sea, as it is stated: “The children of Israel cried out to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10). The Holy One blessed be He heard their prayer and said to Moses: “Why are you crying out to Me? I already heard their cry <your cry>.” – “Speak to the children of Israel and have them set forth.”
Another interpretation: “Why are you crying out to Me?” – that is what is written: “You will decree a matter, and it will be established for you” (Job 22:28). Rabbi Levi said: Just as the Holy One blessed be He commands Moses and speaks with him, so Moses, as it were, commands before the Holy One blessed be He, as the descendants of Joseph say to him [to Moses]: “'The Lord commanded [<i>tziva</i>] my lord…and my lord was commanded [<i>tzuva</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is reading the passive form, <i>tzuvv</i>, was commanded, as if it were the active form, <i>tziva</i>; Moses commanded God, as it were. </i> by the Lord…” (Numbers 36:2). Just as the Holy One blessed be He calls Moses and speaks with him, so Moses calls the Holy One blessed be He and speaks with him, as it is stated: “The Lord spoke to Moses” and it is written: “Moses spoke to the Lord, saying: “Let the Lord, God of the spirits, appoint…” (Numbers 27:15–16). See how powerful he was: When he saw Pharaoh pursuing the children of Israel, he came to cry out, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: Why are you crying out to Me?” He said to him: ‘Why are you in distress?’ Rabbi Yehoshua said: This is analogous to the beloved of a king who had an issue and went to cry out before the king. The king said: ‘Why are you crying out? Decree and I will do it.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Why are you crying out to Me” – speak and I will do it.
Another interpretation: “Why are you crying out to Me?” – that is what is written: “It will be before they call, and I will answer, [while they are still speaking, and I will hear]” (Isaiah 65:24). Twice He says in the verse: “and I…and I,” and Moses says [in the Torah]: “See now that I, I, am He (Deuteronomy 32:39). Indeed, anyone who performs the will of the Holy One blessed be He and directs his heart in prayer, He hears him in this world and likewise in the World to Come, as it is stated: “It will be before they call, and I will answer,” in this world; and in the future, “they are still speaking, and I will hear.” What are they speaking about? It is that each of them is standing and reciting what he has learned and, as it were, He is sitting and reciting with him, as it is stated: “Then they who fear the Lord spoke one with the other” (Malachi 3:16), and it is written: “Your eyes shall see your Teacher” (Isaiah 30:20), and it says: “All your children are taught by the Lord” (Isaiah 54:13). So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: If so,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">If you have already directed your heart in prayer.</i> “why are you crying out to Me?” <br>“It will be before they call, and I will answer” (Isaiah 65:24). Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said: If one of flesh and blood hears the claims of a person, he can render his judgment; if he hasn’t heard, he is unable to determine his judgment. However, the Holy One blessed be He is not thus. Even before a person speaks, He knows what is in his heart. Likewise, regarding Solomon it says: “Know the God of your father, and serve Him [with a single mind, and a willing heart, for the Lord searches all minds and] understands the design of every thought” (I Chronicles 28:9). Even before the thought in the heart of man is formed, He understands. You find that seven generations before Nebuchadnezzar was born, Isaiah prophesied, and articulated what he was destined to think in his heart, as it is stated: “You said in your heart: I will ascend to the heavens” (Isaiah 14:13). If seven generations before, the Holy One blessed be He foresaw what he was destined to think, regarding a righteous person, does He not know what he is destined to think on the same day? That is why it is written: “It will be before they call, and I will answer.” That is why it is stated: “Why are you crying out to Me?”
Another interpretation: “Why are you crying out to Me?” – that is what is written: “Hearer of prayer, to You all flesh will come” (Psalms 65:3). What is “Hearer of prayer?” Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: When Israel prays, you do not find that they all pray as one, but rather, each congregation prays on its own. This congregation begins, and then the other congregation. After all the congregations have finished their prayers, the angel appointed over prayers takes all the prayers that they prayed in all the congregations and crafts them into crowns and places them on the head of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “To you [<i>adekha</i>] all flesh will come,” and <i>adekha </i>means nothing other than crown, as it is stated: “You shall clothe yourself with them all, as with an ornament [<i>ke’adi</i>]” (Isaiah 49:18). So, it says: “Israel, in whom I will be glorified'” (Isaiah 49:3), as the Holy One blessed be He adorns Himself with the prayers of Israel, as it is stated: “And a beautiful crown upon your head” (Ezekiel 16:12). <br>Another interpretation: “Hearer of prayer…” (Psalms 65:3) – you find that flesh and blood is unable to hear the speech of two [different people] simultaneously, but the Holy One blessed be He is not like that; everyone prays before Him and He hears and accepts their prayers. <br>Another interpretation: “Hearer of prayer” (Psalms 65:3) – Rabbi Yehuda bar Shalom in the name of Rabbi Elazar said: [A person of] flesh and blood, if a poor person comes to say something before him, he does heed him; if a wealthy person comes to say something, he immediately hears it and accepts it. However, the Holy One blessed be He is not so; rather, everyone is equal before Him: Women, slaves, the poor, and the wealthy. Know that, about Moses, master of all the prophets, is written what is written about the poor. About Moses, it is written: “A prayer of Moses the man of God” (Psalms 90:1). Regarding the poor it is written: “A prayer of the poor man when he suffers, and pours forth his words before the Lord” (Psalms 102:1). This is prayer and that is prayer, to inform you that everyone is equal in prayer before the Omnipresent. Know that when Israel departed from Egypt, Pharaoh pursued them, as it is stated: “And Pharaoh drew near” (Exodus 14:10), and it is written: “[The children of Israel] cried out to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10). Moses also began praying before the Omnipresent. The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Why are you standing and praying? My children have already prayed and I have heard their prayer,’ as it is stated: “Why are you crying out to Me?”
That is what is written: “My dove in the cleft of the rock” (Song of Songs 2:14). It should have said “a dove in the cleft of the rock.” Why did it say “my dove?” It is as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: “My dove.” See what is written: “Ephraim is like a foolish dove, with no understanding” (Hosea 7:11). The Holy One blessed be He said: To Me they are like a foolish dove; everything that I decree for them, they do and obey Me. However, towards idolaters, they are as tough as beasts, as it is stated: “Judah is a lion’s whelp” (Genesis 49:9); “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf” (Genesis 49:27); “Dan will be a serpent on the road” (Genesis 49:17); that is why they are as tough against idolaters. Why? It is because idolaters say to them: ‘What do you seek from this Shabbat that you observe, from this circumcision that you are circumcised?’ They [idolaters] seek to cancel the mitzvot<i> </i>for them and they [Israel] become as tough as beasts against them. However, to the Holy One blessed be He they are like an innocent dove, and they obey everything that He decrees for them, as it is stated: “The people believed” (Exodus 4:31). And likewise it says: “Everything the Lord has spoken we will do and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). That is why it says: “My dove in the cleft of the rock” (Song of Songs 2:14). <br><b>“Pharaoh drew near and the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and, behold, Egypt was traveling after them, and they were very frightened; the children of Israel cried out to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10).</b> <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said: When Israel departed from Egypt, they lifted up their eyes and the Egyptians were pursuing them, as it is stated: “Pharaoh drew near [and the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and, behold, Egypt was traveling after them].” It does not say “were traveling,” but rather “was traveling.” When Pharaoh and the Egyptians came out in pursuit of them, they raised their eyes heavenward and saw the angel of Egypt floating in the air. When they saw him, they were very frightened, as it is stated: “They were very frightened.” What is “behold, Egypt was traveling after them”? The name of the angel of Egypt was Egypt, as the Holy One blessed be He does not bring about the downfall of a nation until He brings about the downfall of its angel first. Likewise, you find with Nebuchadnezzar that the Holy One blessed be He brought down his angel first, as it is stated: “While the word was in the king's mouth, a voice [<i>kal</i>] fell from heaven” (Daniel 4:28). Rabbi Yehoshua bar Avin said: Nebuchadnezzar’s angel was named <i>Kal</i>, and the Holy One blessed be He brought him down. Likewise, the name of the angel of Pharaoh was Egypt, and it was flying to pursue them. When the Holy One blessed be He sank Egypt into the sea, He first sank their angel, as it is stated: “And the Lord tossed Egypt in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:27); that is the angel of Egypt, and then: “He tossed Pharaoh and his host” (Psalms 136:15). Likewise, it does not say: Their horses and their riders He cast into the sea, but rather, “horse and its rider” (Exodus 15:1), this is their angel; that is: “behold, Egypt was traveling after them.” <br>What is: “Pharaoh drew near [<i>hikriv</i>]”? It is that he drew Israel nearer to repentence. Rabbi Berekhya said: Pharaoh’s drawing near was more effective for Israel than one hundred fasts and prayers. Why? Because when they [the Egyptians] pursued them and they [Israel] saw them, they were greatly afraid and they raised their eyes to Heaven, and repented and prayed, as it is stated: “The children of Israel cried out to the Lord” (Exodus 14:10). Israel said to Moses: ‘What have you done to us? Now they are coming and doing to us everything we did to them; we killed their firstborn, took their property, and fled. Did you not say to us: “Each woman will borrow [silver vessels and gold vessels and garments from her neighbor and from the resident of her house and you shall place them upon your sons and upon your daughters, and you will despoil Egypt]”?’ (Exodus 3:22). At that moment they were standing and they did not know what to do; the sea was closing in, the enemy was pursuing, and the beasts from the wilderness, as it is stated: “The wilderness has closed in [<i>sagar</i>] on them” (Exodus 14:3). Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: <i>Sagar </i>means nothing other than beasts, as it is stated: “My God has sent His angel, and shut [<i>usagar</i>] the lions' mouths” (Daniel 6:23). <br>When Israel saw that they were surrounded on three sides – the sea blocking them, the enemy in pursuit, and the beasts in the wilderness – they raised their eyes to their Father in heaven and cried out to the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The children of Israel cried out to the Lord.” Why did the Holy One blessed be He do this to them? It was because the Holy One blessed be He desires their prayers. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: To what is this matter comparable? It is to a king who was travelling on the way and a princess was screaming to him: ‘Please, save me from the highwaymen.’ The king heard and rescued her. Some time later, he sought to take her as a wife. He desired that she speak to him, but she did not want to do so. What did the king do? He incited the highwaymen against her so that she would scream and the king would hear. When the highwaymen beset her, she began screaming to the king. The king said to her: ‘This is what I desired, to hear your voice.’ So Israel, when they were in Egypt and they [the Egyptians] were forcing them to work, they began screaming and raising their eyes to the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “It was during those many days…they cried out” (Exodus 2:23). Immediately, “God saw the children of Israel” (Exodus 2:25). <br>The Holy One blessed be He began taking them out from there with a powerful hand and an outstretched arm. The Holy One blessed be He sought to hear their voice another time, but they did not wish to do so [to cry out]. What did He do? He incited Pharaoh to pursue them, as it is stated: “Pharaoh drew near.” Immediately, “the children of Israel cried out to the Lord.” At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘That is what I wanted – to hear your voice.’ As it is stated: “My dove in the cleft of the rock […sound me your voice]” (Song of Songs 2:14). It does not say sound me a voice, but rather, “sound me your voice,” – the voice that I already heard in Egypt. That is why it is written: “Sound me your voice.” When they had prayed, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Why are you standing and praying? The prayer of My children preceded your prayer, as it is stated: “Why are you crying out to Me?”’
<b>“And you, raise your staff, and extend your hand over the sea, and split it; and the children of Israel will come into the midst of the sea on dry ground” (Exodus 14:16).</b> <br>“Raise your staff” – Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You are saying to me that I should split the sea and render the sea dry land, but isn’t it written: “I placed the sand as the boundary of the sea” (Jeremiah 5:22)? You swore that you would never split it.’ Rabbi Elazar HaKappar said: Moses said to Him: ‘Didn’t You say that the sea would not be rendered dry land? As it is stated: “I placed the sand as the boundary of the sea,” and it is written: “He shut the sea with doors”’ (Job 38:8). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You did not read from the beginning of the Torah. What is written: “God said: Let the waters be gathered” (Genesis 1:9). It is I who stipulated with it, so, I stipulated with it from the beginning that I would split it, as it is stated: “The sea returned to its power [<i>le’eitano</i>] before the morning” (Exodus 14:27), to its stipulation [<i>tena’o</i>] that I stipulated with it from the beginning. <br>Immediately, Moses heeded the Holy One blessed be He and went to split the sea. When he went to split the sea, it was unwilling to take upon itself to split. The sea said to him: ‘I should split because of you? I am greater than you, as I was created on the third [day of creation] and you were created on the sixth.’ When Moses heard this, he went and said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘The sea refuses to split.’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He placed His right hand on the right hand of Moses, as it is stated: “He caused [His glorious arm] to go to the right of Moses…” (Isaiah 63:12). Immediately, it [the sea] saw the Holy One blessed be He and fled, as it is stated: “The sea saw and fled” (Psalms 114:3). What did it see? It saw that the Holy One blessed be He placed His right hand upon Moses. It could no longer resist, so it fled immediately. Moses said to it: ‘Why are you fleeing?’ It said to him: ‘From the God of Jacob, due to fear of the Holy One blessed be He.’ Immediately, when Moses raised his hand over the sea, it split, as it is stated: “The water divided” (Exodus 14:21). It does not say “the sea divided,” but rather, the water divided. This teaches that all the water that was in all the springs and the cisterns and everywhere divided, as it is stated: “The water divided.” Likewise, when they returned, all the water returned, and so it says: “The water returned” (Exodus 14:28). All these miracles were performed by Moses, as it is stated: “Moses extended his hand over the sea” (Exodus 14:21). That is why the Holy One blessed be He praises him, as it is stated: “He remembered the days of old, Moses, His people: [Where is he who took them up from the sea, the shepherd of His flock?]” (Isaiah 63:11) and it is written: “He caused His glorious arm to go to the right of Moses” (Isaiah 63:12).
Another interpretation: “Why are you crying out to Me?” – that is what is written: “Have you composed your prayer [<i>shuakha</i>] with no trouble?”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Most translations translate <i>shuakha </i>as “your wealth” or something similar. The midrash understands it to mean “your prayer” or “your cry.”</i> (Job 36:19). What is this? Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said: The parable says: Honor your doctor before you need him. Rabbi Shimon says: Compose your prayers before your Creator, so you will not have enemies on high. Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: When Israel departed from Egypt, Samael the angel arose to prosecute them. Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina explained it in the name of his father: This is analogous to a shepherd who was crossing his flock over a river. A wolf came to threaten the flock. What did the expert shepherd do? He took a large ram and gave it to it. He said: Let him scuffle with it until we cross the river, then I will bring it. So, when Israel departed from Egypt, Samael the angel arose to prosecute them. He said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Until now these were worshipping idols, and you are splitting the sea for them?’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He gave him Job, who was one of Pharaoh’s advisers, of whom it is written: “A wholehearted upright man” (Job 1:1). He said to him [Samael]: ‘Here he is, in your control.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘While he is busy with Job, Israel will enter and emerge from the sea, and then I will rescue Job.’ That is what Job said: “I was at peace and He crushed me” (Job 16:12). I was at peace in the world and He crushed me, “He took me by the nape and shattered me” (Job 16:12) in order to render me as protection [<i>matara</i>] for His people, as it is stated: “He established me as a target [<i>matara</i>]” (Job 16:12). And it is written: “He has handed me over to an evil angel” (Job 16:11), He handed me into the hand of the accuser so that Israel would not emerge guilty at trial. That is why He cast me into his hands; that is: “He hast cast me into the hands of the wicked” (Job 16:11). At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘I handed Job to the accuser. What should you do? “Speak to the children of Israel and have them set forth.”’
Rabbi Avtolis the elder said: This is analogous to a king who had a son who angered him. He decreed a harsh punishment for him, and the tutor pleaded on his behalf. He said to him: ‘Are you asking on behalf of my son? I have already reconciled with my son.’ Rabbi says: He [God] said to him [Moses]: ‘Last night you were saying: “Since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name [he has harmed this people, and You did not rescue Your people]” (Exodus 5:23), and now you are standing [before Me] and praying intensely. “Why are you crying out to Me?” Yesterday, they were saying: “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt [that you took us to die in the wilderness]?” (Exodus 14:11), and now you are praying intensely? “Speak to the children of Israel and have them set forth [<i>veyisa’u</i>].” Have them remove [<i>yasiu</i>] a matter from their heart.’ Rabbi says: The Holy One blessed be He says: ‘The faith that Israel had in Me is enough for Me to split the sea for them, as they did not say to Moses:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When Moses said to them: “Speak to the children of Israel, and they shall turn back” (Exodus 14:2).</i> How can we turn back [towards Egypt] and break the hearts of the children and women who are with us? Rather, they had faith in me and followed Moses.’ Rabbi Eliezer says: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘There is a time to shorten [prayers] and a time to extend. My children are in a state of distress, the sea blocks them and the enemy is in pursuit, and you are standing and extending your prayers? “Speak to the children of Israel and have them set forth.”’ <br>Rabbi Yehoshua says: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Israel only needs to set forth. Let them set their legs forth from the dry land to the sea, and you will see the miracles that I will perform on their behalf.’ Rabbi Meir says: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Israel does not need to pray before Me. If Adam, the first man, who was alone, I made dry land for him, as it is stated: “Let the waters be gathered under the heavens” (Genesis 1:9), for a sacred congregation that is destined to say before Me: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2), all the more so.’ Rabbi Benaya says: [God said:] ‘Due to the merit of Abraham, I will split the sea for them, because of what he did, as it is stated: “He split [<i>vayevaka</i>] the wood for the burnt offering”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For the binding of Isaac.</i> (Genesis 22:3), and it says: “The waters were divided [<i>vayibaku</i>]”’ (Exodus 14:21). Rabbi Akiva says: [God said:] ‘Due to the merit of Jacob, I will split the sea for them, as it is stated: “You shall spread to the west and to the east”’ (Genesis 28:14). Rabbi Shimon says: [God said:] ‘I have already had it written about you [Moses]: “In all My house he is trusted” (Numbers 12:7), and you are under My authority and the sea is under My authority; I have appointed you trustee over it, as it is stated: “Raise your staff.”’
Rabbi Simon said: This is analogous to the holder of the rod [of office]<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Roman lictors (magistrates) carried bundles of rods called fasces as a symbol of their office. </i> who was walking outside with the rod in his hand. They said: ‘Were it not for the rod in his hand, he would not be respected.’ The king heard and said: ‘Put down the rod and go outside. Anyone who doesn’t greet you, I will remove his head.’ So, the Egyptians said: ‘Moses would have been unable to do anything but for the staff; with it he struck the Nile, with it he brought all the plagues.’ When Israel came into the midst of the sea and the Egyptians were standing behind them, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Cast away your staff, so they will not say: Were it not for the staff, he would not have been able to split the sea, as it is stated: “Raise your staff.”’ <sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is commenting on the fact that Moses was commanded in Exodus 14:16: “And you, raise your staff, and extend your hand over the sea, and split it; and the children of Israel will come into the midst of the sea on dry land.” However, in the description of the actual action, only Moses extending his arm is mentioned: “Moses extended his hand over the sea and the Lord moved the sea…” (Exodus 14:21).</i>
<b>“The children of Israel came into the midst of the sea upon dry ground; and the waters were a wall for them to their right, and to their left” (Exodus 14:22).</b> <br>“The children of Israel came into the midst of the sea upon dry ground” – if in the midst of the sea, why on dry ground? If on dry ground, why in the midst of the sea? Rather, from here you learn that the sea was not split for them until they entered up to their noses, and then it became dry land for them. Rabbi Nehorai expounded: An Israelite woman would pass through the sea, with her son crying in her hand, and she would extend her hand and take an apple or a pomegranate from the sea and give it to him, as it is stated: “He led them through the depths, as through the wilderness” (Psalms 106:9); just as in the wilderness they lacked nothing, so too in the depths they lacked nothing. That is what Moses said: “These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing” (Deuteronomy 2:7). Nothing was lacking; all they had to do was mention something and it would be created before them. Rabbi Shimon says: Even speech was unnecessary, but rather anyone who thought something in his heart, it would be prepared, as it is stated: “They tried God in their hearts, asking food for their craving” (Psalms 78:18). Alternatively, “You have lacked nothing,” – that no thing [<i>davar</i>] was lacking in the world. But what was lacking? Repentance, as it is stated: “Take words [<i>davar</i>] with you and return to the Lord” (Hosea 14:3).
<b>“I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them; and I will be glorified through Pharaoh, and through his entire host, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, and so they did” (Exodus 14:4).</b> <br>“I will harden Pharaoh's heart.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: This is analogous to two wrestlers, one weak and one strong. The strong one overcame the weak one and received a crown on his head. Who caused the strong one to receive the crown? Was it not the weak one? So, who caused the Holy One blessed be He to receive praise and glory; was it not Pharaoh, whom He tossed, as it is stated: “He tossed Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:15)? That is why “I will be glorified through Pharaoh.” <br><b>“He removed the wheels of their chariot, and caused them to drive with difficulty. Egypt said: ‘Let us flee from before Israel, as the Lord is fighting for them against Egypt’” (Exodus 14:25).</b> <br>“Egypt said: ‘Let us flee from before Israel.’” What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He indicated to the land of Egypt, and it was elevated. They would see the war at the sea, as it is stated: “Egypt<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It does not say the Egyptians. It says “Egypt.”</i> said: ‘Let us flee from before Israel.’” <br>

Chapter 22

<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand over the sea, and the waters will return upon Egypt, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen” (Exodus 14:26).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Extend your hand over the sea, and the waters will return…” – that is what is written: “Catch for us foxes [<i>shualim</i>], little foxes, [that spoil the vineyards, for our vineyards are in blossom]” (Song of Songs 2:15). When He analogizes the kingdoms, He likens them only to beasts, as it is stated: “Four great beasts arose from the sea” (Daniel 7:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The subsequent verses continue the description of Daniel’s vision of the beasts and state that these beasts represent four kingdoms. </i> When He analogizes Egypt, He likens them only to foxes. Just as this fox is smaller than the four beasts, so, Egypt is smaller than the kingdoms, as it is stated: “It will be the lowliest of the kingdoms” (Ezekiel 29:15). <br>Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon said: The Egyptians were sly; that is why He likens them to foxes. Just as a fox walks and looks behind him, so the Egyptians were walking and looking behind them. What did they say? “Let us be cunning with it” (Exodus 1:10). They said: ‘Come and let us act against them wisely and consider how we can enslave them in such a manner that their God will not be able to bring upon us [a punishment] in a parallel manner. If we judge them by sword, He could bring a sword upon us. If by fire, He could bring fire upon us. We know that He took an oath that He would not bring a flood upon the world. Let us judge them with water, as He is unable to bring it upon us.’ <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Wicked ones, I already took an oath that I will not bring a flood upon the world. But what will I do to you? I will bring you to the flood, and I will drag each and every one of you to his flood.’ That is what David said: “They will be hurled [<i>yagiruhu</i>] to the sword [<i>ḥarev</i>]; they will be prey for the foxes” (Psalms 63:11); these are the wicked Egyptians whom the Holy One blessed be He dragged [<i>garar</i>] to the dry land [<i>leḥarbo</i>] of the sea. What is: “They will be prey for the foxes”? The Holy One blessed be He said: This plague will be designated for the foxes, whom the Holy One blessed be He preserved and did not bring [death] upon them [during] the ten plagues, and they died there. Rabbi Berekhya said: The first <i>shualim</i> is with a <i>vav </i>and the second without a <i>vav;</i> <i>sho’alyam</i> is written, in the sense of the hollow of [<i>sho’olo</i>] the sea [<i>yam</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Based on Isaiah 40:12.</i> <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan of Tzippori said: What would the upright and modest Israelite women do? They would take their sons and conceal them in underground chambers. The wicked Egyptians would bring little ones and take them into the Israelite houses and would pinch them and they would cry. The [Israelite] baby would hear the voice of the other baby who was crying and would cry with him. [The Egyptians] would take the [Israelite] baby and cast him into the Nile. That is why it is stated: “Catch for us foxes, little foxes…” – until our vineyard came into blossom.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This parallels the end of the verse in Song of Songs (2:15). In context, the midrash interprets this to mean that all that were left were undeveloped grapes; all the ripe ones, representing the babies already born, were cast into the Nile.</i> That is why it is stated: “The waters will return upon Egypt,” as the punishment fits their crime. So Yitro said: “Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, as in the matter [that they conspired against them]” (Exodus 18:11). He said: I knew Him in the past, and more so now, as with the [very] strategy with which they thought to judge Israel, the Holy One blessed be He judged them, as it is stated: “As in the matter that they conspired against them.”
Another matter, “the waters will return” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the last of the Israelites ascended from the sea, the last of the Egyptians descended into it. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: For these and for those, the sea was closing in on them from [all] four directions. Moses said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘What should Israel do?’ He said to him: ‘You need not ask. Why? It is because I will perform a miracle on their behalf.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He extended His hand and took them up from the sea, as it is stated: “He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters” (Psalms 18:17). <br>Rabbi Abbahu said: This is analogous to one who saw marauders coming against him and his son was with him. What did he do? He took his child in one hand and battled the marauders with the other. His son said to him: ‘Father, may I never be without these two hands, one that holds me and one that kills the marauders.’ So too, Israel said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Let there be peace upon your two hands; one that rescues us from the sea, and one that would toss the Egyptians,’ as it is stated: “Your right hand, Lord, glorious in power, Your right hand, Lord, [shatters the enemy]” (Exodus 15:6). “The sea will return” is not stated, but rather, “the waters will return” – from here [it is derived that] all the waters returned. “Upon the Egyptians” is not stated, but rather, “upon Egypt,” as the Holy One blessed be He took their angel first and drowned him in the sea, and then all of them descended after him. That is why it is stated: “The waters will return upon Egypt,” and then “upon their chariots and upon their horsemen.”
<b>“Israel saw the great power that the Lord wielded upon Egypt and the people feared the Lord; and they believed in the Lord, and in His servant Moses” (Exodus 14:31).</b> <br>“The people feared the Lord.” Our Rabbis taught: One who recites <i>Shema</i> is required to mention the splitting of the Red Sea and the plague of the firstborn in <i>emet veyatziv</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Literally “true and firm,” these are the first words of the blessing recited after <i>shema</i> in the morning.</i> but if he did not mention them, one does not require him to repeat it. However, if he did not mention the exodus from Egypt, one requires him to repeat it, as it is stated: “So you will remember the day that you departed from the land of Egypt” (Deuteronomy 16:3). What is the difference between the exodus from Egypt and the splitting of the Red Sea? It is that the exodus from Egypt was more difficult, as it is stated: “Or has any god attempted [to go and take a nation for him from the midst of another nation…according to everything that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt?] (Deuteronomy 4:34). “But the Lord has taken you…[from Egypt”] (Deuteronomy 4:20). Know that this is more difficult than that, as regarding the exodus from Egypt it is written: “I am the Lord your God [who took you out of the land of Egypt]” (Exodus 20:2), but regarding the splitting of the Red Sea, it does not mention the Name.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that God says “I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt” but does not say: “I am God who split the sea for you,” indicates that taking Israel out of Egypt was more difficult, and is a greater testament to God’s commitment to Israel. </i> <br>Why must one mention the splitting of the Red Sea in <i>emet veyatziv</i>? It is because after He split the sea for them, they believed in Him, as it is stated: “And they believed in the Lord, and in His servant Moses.” Due to their belief, they were privileged to recite a song, and the Divine Spirit rested upon them, as it is written afterward: “Then Moses [and the Israelites] sang…” (Exodus 15:1). That is why a person must juxtapose redemption to prayer,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">One should recite the <i>Shemoneh Esrei</i> prayer immediately after reciting the blessing mentioning the redemption from Egypt. </i> just as they juxtaposed a song after their belief and the splitting. Just as they purified their hearts and recited a song, as it is written: “And the people feared the Lord; and they believed,” and then: “Then…sang,” so a person must purify his heart before he prays. <br>Likewise, Job said: “For there is no villainy in my hands, and my prayer is pure” (Job 16:17). Rabbi Yehoshua HaKohen ben Rabbi Neḥemya said: Is there a sullied prayer? Rather, anyone whose hands are sullied with robbery, he calls to the Holy One blessed be He and He does not answer him. Why? Because his prayer is [carried out] in sin, as it is stated: “God said to Noah: The end of all flesh [has come before me, as the earth is filled with villainy<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is understood as a reference to robbery. </i> because of them]” (Genesis 6:13). But Job, who did not engage in robbery, his prayer was pure; that is why it says: “For there is no villainy in my hands.” Because there is no injustice in my hands or in my actions, my prayer is pure. <br>Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: From where is it derived that anyone with stolen property in his possession, his prayer is sullied? It is as it is stated: “When you spread your hands…I will not hear” (Isaiah 1:15). Why? It is because “your hands are full of blood” (Isaiah 1:15). From where is it derived that anyone who distances himself from robbery, his prayer is pure? It is as it is stated: “He who has clean hands, and a pure heart” (Psalms 24:4). What is written afterward? “He shall receive a blessing from the Lord…. This is the generation of those who seek Him” (Psalms 24:5–6).

Chapter 23

<b>“Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord, and spoke, saying: I will sing to the Lord, for He is exalted; the horse and his rider He cast into the sea” (Exodus 15:1).</b> <br>“Then [<i>az</i>] Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “Your throne is established of old [<i>me’az</i>]; [You have existed from eternity]” (Psalms 93:2). Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Abahu: Even though “You have existed from eternity,” Your throne was not settled and You were not known in Your world until Your children sang a song. That is why it is stated: “Your throne is established of old.” This is analogous to a king who waged war and was victorious and they made him emperor. They said to him: ‘Until you waged war, you were king, now we have made you emperor.’ What is the difference between the deference accorded to a king and that accorded to an emperor? A king is depicted on a tablet standing, while an emperor is depicted seated.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In illustrations, a king is depicted standing, as though ready to do battle, while an emperor is depicted sitting, having already been victorious over his enemies and no longer being subject to threat. </i> So, Israel said: ‘In truth, before You created the world You were You, and once You created the world You were You, but, as it were, standing, as it is stated: “He stood and measured the earth” (Habakkuk 3:6). But, when You stood at the sea and we sang a song before You with the term “<i>az</i>,” your kingdom was settled, and Your throne established.’ That is: “Your throne is established of old [<i>me’az</i>],” with “then [<i>az</i>] Moses…sang.”
Another matter, “then Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “They believed in His words, they sang His praise” (Psalms 106:12). Rabbi Abahu said: Although it is written that they already believed while they were in Egypt, as it is stated: “The people believed” (Exodus 4:31), they subsequently did not believe, as it is stated: “Our ancestors in Egypt did not comprehend Your wonders” (Psalms 106:7). When they came to the sea and saw the might of the Holy One blessed be He, how He administers justice to the wicked, as you say: “My hand grasps judgment” (Deuteronomy 32:41), and He sunk the Egyptians in the sea, immediately: “They believed in God” (Exodus 14:31). Due to that belief, the Divine Spirit rested upon them and they sang a song. That is what is written: “Then [<i>az</i>] Moses and the children of Israel sang.” <i>Az </i>means nothing other than faith, as it is stated: “It was from when [<i>me’az</i>] he appointed him in his house” (Genesis 39:5), and it is written: “Everything he had he placed in his hands” (Genesis 39:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">When Potiphar trusted Joseph fully and placed him in charge of his entire household, the verse uses the word <i>az</i> in stating that Potiphar appointed Joseph in his house. </i> That is: “They believed in His words, they sang His praise.”
Another matter, “then Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “Your lips drip nectar, [my bride]” (Song of Songs 4:11). Moses said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, with what I sinned before You, I laud You.’ Rabbi Levi bar Ḥiya said: This is analogous to a province that rebelled against the king. The king said to his duke: ‘Let us go and wage war against it.’ The duke said to him: ‘You are unable [to conquer it].’ The king was silent and went himself at night and conquered it. The duke knew, and he crafted a crown and brought it to the king. [The king] said to him: ‘What is the reason for this crown?’ He said: ‘It is because I sinned in this regard and said that you were unable.’ So too, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘I know that I sinned before you with the word <i>az</i>, as it is stated: “Since [<i>me’az</i>] I came to Pharaoh [to speak in Your name he has harmed this people, and You did not rescue Your people]” (Exodus 5:23), and you drowned him in the sea. That is why I am praising you with the word <i>az</i>; that is what is written: “Then [<i>az</i>] Moses…sang.”’ <br>Come and see the path of the righteous, with that with which they sin and they atone; that is: “Your lips drip nectar, my bride.” From whom do they learn this? It is from the Holy One blessed be He, as with that that He strikes, He heals, as it is stated: “For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds” (Jeremiah 30:17); with the wounds that I smite you, I heal you.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “of your wounds” may also be translated “with your wounds.” The midrash interprets the verse to mean that God says: I will use your wounds themselves to heal you. </i> From where is it derived? Know that it is so from the Holy One blessed be He. Come and learn from [what happened with the waters of] Mara. He indicated a bitter item to Moses, [Moses] cast it in the water, and the water was made sweet, as it is stated: “The Lord showed him a tree and he cast it into the water” (Exodus 15:25). Which [tree] was it? Rabbi Natan says: It was oleander. Rabbi Yehoshua says: It was a willow. Rabbi Eliezer HaModa’i says: It was an olive tree. In any case, it was a bitter tree and it sweetened the bitter water. So too, Moses complained only with <i>az</i>, and with what he sinned, he atoned, and said: “Then [<i>az</i>] Moses…sang.”
Another matter, “then Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “She opens her mouth with wisdom and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue” (Proverbs 31:26). From the day that the Holy One blessed be He created the world until Israel stood at the sea, we do not find a person who sang a song to the Holy One blessed be He other than Israel. He created Adam, the first man, and he did not recite song. He rescued Abraham from the fiery furnace and from the kings, and he did not recite song. Likewise, [He rescued] Isaac from the knife and he did not recite song. Likewise, [He rescued] Jacob from the angel, from Esau, and from the residents of Shekhem, and he did not recite song. When Israel came to the sea and it was split for them, they immediately sang a song before the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Then Moses and the children of Israel sang.” That is, “she opens her mouth with wisdom.” The Holy One blessed be He said: “I have been waiting for [people such as] these [to recite song].” <i>Az</i> means nothing other than rejoicing, as it is stated: “Then [<i>az</i>] our mouth will be filled with laughter” (Psalms 126:2). <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: What did Israel see, that led them to recite song with <i>az</i>? They said: ‘Initially, this sea was dry land, and the generation of Enosh arose and incensed Him with <i>az</i>, as it is stated: “Then [<i>az</i>] they began profaning the name of the Lord” (Genesis 4:26). The Holy One blessed be He rendered it [dry land] sea and exacted retribution against them, as it is stated: “Who calls the waters of the sea and pours them on the face of the earth” (Amos 5:8; 9:6). Now it was sea, and it was transformed to dry land on our behalf, as it is stated: “The children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea” (Exodus 14:29). We will laud him with <i>az</i> because he transformed the sea into dry land; that is, “then Moses and the children of Israel sang.” <i>Az</i> means nothing other than security, as it is stated: “Then [<i>az</i>] you shall walk on your path securely” (Proverbs 3:23).
Another matter, “then Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “With me from Lebanon, my bride, [with me from Lebanon, come]” (Song of Songs 4:8). Rabbi Levi said: The standard practice is that a bride is adorned and perfumed and then she is taken to the wedding canopy. But the Holy One blessed be He did not do so, but rather, He said to the congregation of Israel: “With me from Lebanon [<i>Levanon</i>], my bride,” – from the mortar and the bricks [<i>levenim</i>] I have taken you, and I have rendered you a bride. <br>Why does it say “with me from Lebanon” twice? The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘With Me you have been exiled from the Temple that is called Lebanon, as it is stated: “I climbed the highest mountain to the ends of Lebanon”’ (Isaiah 37:24). From where is it derived that the Divine Presence went with Israel into exile? It is as it is stated: “Because of you I sent to Babylon” (Isaiah 43:14), and it says: “The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest” (Ezekiel 1:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This prophecy took place in Babylon.</i> Likewise, Daniel says: “I was by the side of the great river, the Tigris” (Daniel 10:4). Likewise Moses said: “But despite all this, while they will be in the land of their enemies…I am not able to forsake them…as I am the Lord their God” (Leviticus 26:44). I have acted due to the sanctity of My name, and with Me you will return; that is what is written: “With me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon, come” (Song of Songs 4:8). From the kingdoms that are called Lebanon, as it is stated: “Behold, Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon” (Ezekiel 31:3). Likewise it says: “The one who breaches goes before them…and their king passed before them and God is at their head” (Micha 2:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God leads them out of exile, from the kingdoms called Lebanon. </i> <br>“Look from the top of Amana” (Song of Songs 4:8). Rabbi Yusta said: ‘There is a mountain named Amana. Until that mountain is the Land of Israel, and beyond it is outside the Land.’ Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Yosei said: When the exiles will reach there,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">On their return from the exile. </i> they will recite song; that is why it says: “Look from the top of Amana.” <br>Alternatively, “look from the top of Amana [from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of leopards]” (Song of Songs 4:8). Israel is destined to recite song in the future, as it is stated: “Sing to the Lord a new song; as He has performed wonders” (Psalms 98:1). Due to whose merit does Israel recite song? It is due to the merit of Abraham, who believed in the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: ”He believed in God” (Genesis 15:6). This is the faith [<i>emuna</i>] by virtue of which Israel inherits [the Land], and in his regard, the verse states: “But the righteous shall live by his faith” (Habakkuk 2:4); that is: “Look from the top of Amana.” “From the top of Senir” – due to the merit of Isaac; “and Hermon” – due to the merit of Jacob; “from the lions’ den” – the Babylonian and Persian exile; “from the mountains of leopards” – this is Edom. <br>Another matter, “look from the top of Amana” – Rabbi Neḥemya said: Israel merited to recite song at the sea only due to the merit of belief [<i>emuna</i>], as it is stated: “The people believed” (Exodus 4:31), and it is written: “They believed in the Lord” (Exodus 14:31). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Could they have seen all those miracles that were performed on their behalf and not have believed? Rather, Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said: It is because of the belief that Abraham believed in the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated; “He believed in the Lord” (Genesis 15:6). Because of it, Israel merited to recite song, as it is stated: “Then Moses…sang” – that is: “Look from the top of Amana.”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the verse “Look [<i>tashuri</i>] from the top [<i>rosh</i>] of Amana” to mean: You will sing [<i>tashiri</i>] due to the leader [<i>rosh</i>] of those who had faith [<i>emuna</i>], namely Abraham. </i>
Another matter, “then Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “But I will sing of Your might; I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning, [You were a fortress for me and a refuge on the day of my distress]” (Psalms 59:17). “I will sing of Your might” – in the future, as it is stated: “[And in that day you shall say…] Behold, God is my salvation I will trust and I will not fear [for God is my might and song]” (Isaiah 12:1–2). “I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning” – [in] that morning of the day of judgment, as it is stated: “The watchman said: Morning comes and also night” (Isaiah 21:12). “You were a fortress for me” in Edom; “and a refuge on the day of my distress” in Gog and Magog. <br>Alternatively, “but I will sing of Your might” (Psalms 59:17) – when [did this occur]? When Israel was standing at the sea and reciting song, as it is stated: “Then Moses…sang.” What did they say? “The Lord is my strength” (Exodus 15:2). “I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning,” – that morning when You looked down on the Egyptian encampment, as it is stated: “It was at the morning watch, [and the Lord looked down at the camp of Egypt]” (Exodus 14:24). Alternatively, that morning that You brought the manna down for us, as it is stated: “In the morning there was a layer of dew” (Exodus 16:13). Alternatively, that morning of the giving of the Torah, as it is stated: “It was on the third day, when it was morning” (Exodus 19:16). “You were a fortress for me” with Pharaoh and Egypt, “and a refuge on the day of my distress” with Amalek.
Another matter, “then Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “The singers first, then the musicians” (Psalms 68:26). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The angels sought to recite song before the Holy One blessed be He on that night that Israel crossed the sea, but the Holy One blessed be He did not allow them to do so. He said to them: ‘My legions are in distress, and you are reciting song before Me?’ That is what is written: “One did not approach the other [<i>zeh el zeh</i>] throughout the night” (Exodus 14:20), as it is stated: “One called the other [<i>zeh el zeh</i>] and said: [Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory]” (Isaiah 6:3). When Israel emerged from the sea, the angels came to precede [Israel with] their song before the Holy One blessed be He. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Let My children go first.’ That is what is written: “Then [<i>az</i>] Moses…sang [<i>yashir</i>].” “<i>Az</i> <i>shar</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Past tense.</i> is not stated, but rather, “[<i>az yashir</i>],”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Future tense.</i> as the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let Moses and the children of Israel sing [<i>yashir</i>] first.’ Likewise David says: “The singers first,” – these are Israel who stood at the sea, as it is written: “Then Moses…sang.” <br>“Then the musicians,” – these are the angels. Why so?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Why did God say that the Israelites should recite their song before the angels recite theirs? </i> The Holy One blessed be He said to the angels: ‘It is not because I am debasing you that I am saying that they will precede you. Rather, it is so the flesh and blood will recite first, before one of them dies. But you, whenever you seek [to recite song you can, as] you live and endure.’ This is analogous to a king whose son was taken captive and he went and rescued him. The residents of the palace sought to laud the king, and his son sought to laud him. They said to him: ‘Our master, who should laud you first?’ He said to them: ‘My son, and after that, anyone who seeks to laud me may laud me.’ So too, when Israel departed from Egypt, and the Holy One blessed be He split the sea for them, and the angels were seeking to recite song, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: “Then Moses and the children of Israel will sing” first, and then you.’ That is, “the singers first” – these are Israel, “then the musicians,” – these are the angels. “In the midst of young women drumming” (Psalms 68:26) – these are the women who drummed in the middle, as it is written: “Miriam the prophetess took […the drum in her hand]” (Exodus 15:20).
Rabbi Yehuda says: Who was reciting accolades to the Holy One blessed be He? It was the children, those whom Pharaoh sought to cast into the Nile, as they recognized the Holy One blessed be He. How so? When Israel was in Egypt, and one of the Israelite women sought to give birth, she would go out to the field and give birth there. When she would give birth, she would leave the child and deliver him to the Holy One blessed be He, and say: ‘Master of the universe, I did mine; You do Yours.’ Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He Himself would descend, as it were, cut their umbilical cord, bathe them, and smear them with oil. So Ezekiel said: “You were cast in the open field in the loathsomeness of your person [on the day you were born]” (Ezekiel 16:5). And it is written: “Regarding your birth, on the day you were born, your navel was not cut” (Ezekiel 16:4). And it is written: “I clothed you in embroidery” (Ezekiel 16:10). And it is written: “I bathed you in water” (Ezekiel 16:9). <br>He would place two round stone receptacles in [the child’s] hand, one from which he would suckle oil and one from which he would suckle milk, as it is stated: “He gave him to suckle honey from a stone, and oil from a flinty rock” (Deuteronomy 32:13). They would grow in the field, as it is stated: “I caused you to grow like the growth of the field” (Ezekiel 16:7). When they had grown, they would enter the houses of their fathers, who would ask them: ‘Who tended to you?’ They would say: ‘A certain handsome, outstanding young man would descend and provide all our needs,’ as it is stated: “My beloved is clear-skinned and ruddy, more eminent than ten thousand” (Song of Songs 5:10). When Israel arrived at the sea, those same children were there and they saw the Holy One blessed be He at the sea. They began saying to their fathers: ‘This is the One who was doing all those things for us when we were in Egypt,’ as it is stated: “This is my God, and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase “this is my God” is taken to mean that they recognized Him. </i>
Another matter, “then Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “The Lord is known, He executed justice” (Psalms 9:17). It refers to the Egyptians, as the Holy One blessed be He executed justice against them in Egypt and at the sea. Rabbi Yehoshua says: They were afflicted with ten plagues with one finger, as it is stated: “The magicians said to Pharaoh: It is the finger of God” (Exodus 8:15). At the sea they were afflicted with fifty plagues, as it is stated: “Israel saw the great power [<i>hayad hagedola</i>]” (Exodus 14:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The literal translation of <i>hayad hagedola</i> is “the great hand.” </i> The hand has five fingers, and five times ten are fifty. Likewise, you find with Job that he was afflicted with fifty plagues, as it is stated: “Pity me, pity me; you are my friends, as the hand of God has touched me” (Job 19:21). <br>Rabbi Eliezer says: The Egyptians were afflicted with forty plagues in Egypt and two hundred at the sea, as each and every plague that came upon them, they would come as four, as it is stated: “He destroyed their vines with hail” (Psalms 78:47), and it is written: “[He sent upon them] His burning anger; rage, fury, trouble, a band of evil angels” (Psalms 78:49). “Rage” is one; “fury” is two, “trouble” is three; “a band of evil angels” is four. That is, with a finger they were afflicted with forty plagues and with a hand two hundred. That is, “He executed justice.” What is, “the Lord is known”? It is as it is written: “Egypt will know that I am the Lord,” (Exodus 14:18), when I impose punishment upon Pharaoh, as it is written afterward: “When I am glorified through Pharaoh” (Exodus 14:18). And it is written: “With the work of his hands, the wicked is snared” (Psalms 9:17) – this is Pharaoh. What did he say? “Every son that is born [you shall cast him into the Nile]” (Exodus 1:22). The Holy One blessed be He, too, did to him as he had done, as it is stated: “He tossed Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:15). What is: “<i>Higayon Selah” </i>(Psalms 9:17)? Israel said: What is incumbent upon us to do? It is only to recite songs and paeans, as it is stated: “Then Moses…sang [<i>yashir</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>higayon</i> is thus interpreted as referring to song [<i>nigun</i>] and thought (as in Psalms 19:15). <i>Selah</i> means forever (<i>Eruvin </i>54a). Thus, the Israelites realized that they should sing to God forever (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>). </i> Then Moses and the children of Israel sang [<i>yashiru</i>] is not stated, but rather, “then Moses sang [<i>yashir</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>yashir</i> is singular, whereas the plural term is <i>yashiru</i>.</i> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: From here, the passage was sung by Moses, and then our ancestors sang it at the sea.
Another matter, “then Moses…sang” – that is what is written: “I am black but comely [daughters of Jerusalem–like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon]” (Song of Songs 1:5). The congregation of Israel says: ‘I am black in my actions and comely in the actions of my ancestors.’ Our Rabbis said: Do not read “daughters of [<i>benot</i>] Jerusalem,” but rather, “builders of [<i>bonot</i>] Jerusalem,” – these are the Great Sanhedrins of Israel, who sit and fortify it. Alternatively, “daughters of [<i>benot</i>] Jerusalem” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Jerusalem is destined to become a metropolis of all the lands, as it is written: “Ashdod and its environs [<i>benoteha</i>]” (Joshua 15:47). <br>What is “like the tents of Kedar” (Song of Songs 1:5)? Just as the tents of the Ishmaelites are ugly on the outside and pleasant on the inside, so, too, Torah scholars, even though they appear ugly in this world, on the inside they are full of Bible, Mishna, Talmud, <i>Halakhot</i>, and <i>Aggadot</i>. If so, just as the Ishmaelite tents move from place to place, [could it be] that Israel would also be itinerant? The verse states: “Like the curtains of Solomon [<i>shelomo</i>]” (Song of Songs 1:5), – like the curtains of He who spoke and the world came into being,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The verse compares Israel to the “curtains of Solomon [<i>shelomo</i>].” The midrash interprets the word <i>shelomo</i> as a reference to God, as peace is His [<i>shalom shelo</i>] (<i>Shir HaShirim Rabba</i> 1:5). </i> which, from the moment that He stretched them like a tent, they did not move from their place. If so, just as the tents of the Ishmaelites cannot be laundered, [could it be] that Israel is the same? The verse states: “Like the curtains of Solomon,” – just as a garment gets dirty and then becomes clean again, so, Israel, even though they sin, they repent before the Holy One blessed be He. <br>Another matter, “I am black but comely” – In the place where I have become black, I have become comely. They sinned at Ḥorev, as it is stated: “At Ḥorev you provoked the Lord” (Deuteronomy 9:8). And at Ḥorev they said: “Everything that the Lord said, we will do and we will obey” (Exodus 24:7). At the sea they were defiant, as it is stated: “They were defiant at the sea, the Red Sea” (Psalms 106:7). At the sea, they sang a song, as it is stated: “Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song [to the Lord].”
All the songs that were sung in the world are in the feminine form,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shira</i> and not <i>shir</i>.</i> to say: Just as a female becomes pregnant, gives birth, and again gives birth, so it was, with all the troubles that befall them, they would recite songs in the feminine form. That is why Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom arose and enslaved Israel. But in the future, there will be no more troubles, as it is stated: “For the earlier troubles will have been forgotten” (Isaiah 65:16), “They will attain gladness and joy” (Isaiah 35:10). At that moment they will recite song in the masculine form, as it is stated: “Sing to the Lord a new song [<i>shir</i>]” (Psalms 98:1).
Another matter, “then Moses…sang [this song]” – that is what is written: “He raised me from the tumultuous pit,” (Psalms 40:3) – from Egypt. “From the miry mortar” (Psalms 40:3) – from mortar and bricks. “He set my feet upon a rock” (Psalms 40:3) – this is the sea. “He steadies my footsteps” (Psalms 40:3) – as they crossed on dry land. Immediately, “he placed a new song in my mouth” (Psalms 40:4). This is analogous to a woman who was a menstruant. She completed her days of menstruation and became pure. She came to her husband, and he said to her: ‘Who attests that you are ritually pure?’ She said to him: ‘My maidservant will attest that I purified in her presence and I immersed.’ That is why it is stated: “This song,” – we are fit to recite song before you, as there is no impurity among us. The circumcision attests that we are pure; that is why it is stated: “This [<i>hazot</i>] song.” “This”<i> </i>means nothing other than circumcision, as it is stated: “This is my covenant that you shall observe…[circumcise every male]” (Genesis 17:10). <br>“And spoke, saying” (Exodus 15:1) – we will say to our children, and our children to their children, so they will recite a song like this before You when You perform miracles on their behalf.
“I will sing to the Lord, for He is exalted” (Exodus 15:1) – that is what is written: “Adorn yourself now with majesty and excellence” (Job 40:10). All things exalt themselves over others. Darkness exalts itself over the depths, as it is above it. The wind exalts itself over the water, as it is above it. The fire exalts itself over the wind, as it is above it. The heavens exalt themselves over the fire, as it is above it. The Holy One blessed be He exalts Himself over everything, as it is stated: “For He is exalted [<i>ga’o ga’a</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The double term <i>gao gaa</i> implies that God is exalted above all else. </i> <br>Rabbi Avin said: Four types of exalted ones were created in the world: The most exalted of living creatures is man; the most exalted of birds is the eagle; the most exalted of domesticated animals is the ox; the most exalted of beasts is the lion. All of them received kingship, they were granted prominence, and they are fixed beneath the chariot of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The likeness of their faces…the face of a man…the face of a lion…the face of an ox…the face of an eagle” (Ezekiel 1:10). Why was it so? It was so they would not exalt themselves in the world and they would know that the kingdom of Heaven is above them. In that regard it is stated: “For One higher than high watches, and there are higher than they” (Ecclesiastes 5:7); that is, “for He is exalted.”
Another matter, “for He is exalted” – that is what is written: “[I have likened you my love] to a mare [<i>lesusati</i>] in Pharaoh’s chariots” (Song of Songs 1:9). Rabbi Pappos expounded: <i>Lesusati</i> is written<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Without a <i>vav</i>, and therefore it can be read <i>lesisati</i>, meaning My gladness. The Holy One blessed be He exalted over Pharaoh.</i> <as it appears in <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba </i>1:9> until: Do you have wind, do you have wings?<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash in <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba</i> describes Pharaoh as exalting over the sea as he pursues the children of Israel. God responds that He is incomparably more powerful than Pharaoh. The midrash cite the verse: “He rode upon a cherub and flew; He swooped down upon the wings of the wind” (Psalms 18:11). </i> Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He diverted them<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The cherub and the wind.</i> and He brought them from between the wheels of the [divine] chariot and He diverted them to the sea. What is “I have likened you my love” (Song of Songs 1:9)? The waves of the sea were like mares, and the [horses of the] wicked Egyptians like lustful stallions, and they pursued [the waves] until [the Egyptians] sank to the bottom of the sea, as it is stated: “The horse and his rider He cast into the sea [<i>rama bayam</i>]” (Exodus 15:1). The Egyptian would say to his horse: ‘Yesterday I would lead you to have you drink water and you would not follow me. Now you come [rushing toward the water] to sink me in the sea?’ The horse would say to him: ‘<i>Rama bayam</i>, look at what is in the sea [<i>re’eh ma bayam</i>], the heights of the universe [<i>rumo shel olam</i>] I see in the sea [<i>bayam</i>].’
Another matter, “the horse and his rider He cast into the sea” (Exodus 15:1) – “their horses and their riders” is not written, but rather, “the horse and his rider.” This teaches that the Holy One blessed be He took their angel first and cast him into the sea. <br><b>“The Lord is my strength and song, and He has become my salvation; this is my God, and I will glorify Him; my father's God, and I will exalt Him (Exodus 15:2).</b> <br>“The Lord is my strength [<i>ozi</i>] and song” – He is my strength, and a crown<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The letters <i>zayin</i> and <i>dalet</i> can sometimes be interchanged, as is common for words that appear otherwise identically in Hebrew and Aramaic. Thus <i>ozi</i> can be rendered <i>adi</i>, which means ornament or crown (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>). </i> on my head, and He is my might. <br>“And He has become my salvation.” “He will be [<i>yehi</i>] for me” is not written here, but rather, “he has become [<i>vayhi</i>] my salvation,” – He was for me and will be for me. <br>“This is my God, and I will glorify Him.” Rabbi Berekhya said: Come and see how great were those who descended into the sea. Moses, how much he prostrated himself and entreated before the Omnipresent, until he saw the image [of the glory of God], as it is stated: “Please, show me Your glory” (Exodus 33:18). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “You are unable to see My face” (Exodus 33:20). Ultimately, He showed him indirectly, as it is stated: “It will be when My glory passes […You shall see My back but My face shall not be seen” (Exodus 33:22–23). The beasts that bear the chariot do not recognize the image, and when the time arrives to recite song, they say: ‘Where is He? We do not know whether He is here, or whether He is elsewhere, rather, wherever He is: “Blessed is the glory of the Lord from His place”’ (Ezekiel 3:12). Yet those who emerged from the sea, each and every one of them would point with his finger and say: “This is my God, and I will glorify Him.” The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘In this world, you said before Me once: “This [<i>zeh</i>] is My God,” but in the future you will say the same thing twice, as it is stated: “It will be said on that day: Behold, this [<i>zeh</i>] is our God, we waited for Him to save us. This [<i>zeh</i>] [is the Lord; for whom we waited. We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation]” (Isaiah 25:9).

Chapter 24

<b>“Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went out to the wilderness of Shur. They walked three days in the wilderness and did not find water” (Exodus 15:22).</b> <br>“Moses led Israel,”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse implies that the people did not travel willingly and therefore Moses had to direct them to move onward from the sea. </i> that is what is written: “Do you thus requite the Lord?” (Deuteronomy 32:6). Rabbi Sheshe son of Rabbi Abba would write the <i>heh </i>below it and the <i>lamed </i>above it, as though to say: Alas, do you thus requite the Lord?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>heh</i> in the word “do…the Lord [הלה']” appears slightly distinct from the rest of the word, implying that it stood for its own word, alas [<i>hoy</i>]. </i> After all the miracles that He performed on your behalf; that He split the sea into twelve portions, and He submerged the Egyptians into the sea, and one of His hands was submerging them and one of His hands was rescuing you, as it is stated: “Your right hand, Lord, is glorious in strength; Your right hand, Lord, [smashes an enemy]” (Exodus 15:6). He took you up from the sea and gave you their silver and gold, as well as everything that was on their horses that were adorned with silver and gold. He fed you for forty years and did not leave you for even one moment. How many enemies came against you, but He did not allow you to flee, but rather He toppled them before you and protected you. It was not only from your enemies, but also from serpents and scorpions. He illuminated before you, as it is stated: “The Lord went before them by day [in a pillar of cloud…and by night in a pillar of fire, to illuminate for them]” (Exodus 13:21). You forgot all the miracles that the Holy One blessed be He performed on your behalf. Mikha’s idol was crossing the sea with you, and you abandoned matters of Torah and fixated on other matters. “Is it to the Lord that you do this?” <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: Not only did Mikha’s idol cross with them, but they spoke contentiously toward God, as it is stated: “Whom You redeemed for You from Egypt, nations and their gods” (II Samuel 7:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is generally understood to refer to what God did to other nations and their gods on behalf of Israel. It is interpreted here to mean that God took from Egypt Israel and its gods, a reference to the idol of Mikha. </i> <br>Likewise, it says: “They were defiant at the sea, in the Red Sea” (Psalms 106:7). Why twice?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Why “at the sea” and again “in the Red Sea.”</i> Rather, at the sea they were defiant in that they did not wish to descend, were it not for the tribe of Judah that leapt first and sanctified the name of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “When Israel went out of Egypt…Judah became His holy one” (Psalms 114:1–2). From where is it derived that they were defiant while in the Red Sea? When they descended into the sea [the ground] was full of mortar, as it had been until then wet from the water, so it was like mortar, as it is stated: “You trampled the sea with Your horses, the roiling [<i>ḥomer</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>ḥomer</i> can also be vocalized <i>ḥemar</i>, mortar.</i> of mighty waters” (Habakkuk 3:15). Reuben was saying to Simeon: In Egypt “with mortar,” at the sea there is mortar. In Egypt, “with mortar and with bricks” (Exodus 1:14); at the sea: “The roiling [<i>ḥomer</i>]<i> </i>of mighty waters.” That is, “they were defiant at the sea, in the Red Sea.” After all these miracles, you repay Me with evil? <br>“Do you thus requite the Lord, vile and unwise people?” (Deuteronomy 32:6). It is regarding the generation of Jeremiah that he said this verse. “Vile [<i>naval</i>]…people,” who were rendered carcasses [<i>nevelot</i>], as it is stated: “They gave the carcasses of Your servants to birds of the heavens” (Psalms 79:2). Why? Because they were unwise, as it is stated: “Vile and unwise people.” Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: If the mightiest of the mighty is below, and the weakest of the weak is above, [the one above] will emerge victorious, and more so if the mighty is above and the weak is below. How much more so when the Holy One blessed be He, the mightiest of the mighty, is above, and you, flesh and blood, are below, must you not understand?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">You must understand that you must submit to Him.</i> You are a “vile and unwise people.” <br>“Is He not your Father, your Master [<i>kanekha</i>]?” (Deuteronomy 32:6). If you merit it, your father; just as a son is petulant with his father and he performs his will, so you are petulant before Him, and He performs your will. <br>Another matter, if He is your Father, why your Master; if He is your Master, why your Father? Rather, when Israel performs the will of the Omnipresent, He has mercy on them like a father on his sons. When they do not perform His will, He subjugates them like a slave. Just as a slave, whether he likes it or not, serves his master against his will, so too, you will perform the will of the Omnipresent against your will, whether you like it or not. <br>Rabbi Taḥalifa of Caesarea says in the name of Rabbi Pila: Come and see how many miracles the Holy One blessed be He performs for a person, but he does not know. Were one to eat bread as is, it would descend to his innards and scratch them. But the Holy One blessed be He created a water source in his throat<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Pila interprets the term “your Master [<i>kanekha</i>]” as an allusion to the esophagus [<i>kaneh</i>]. The simple fact that one has saliva, which aids in swallowing food, is a great gift that God provided humanity, which they do not even recognize as such (Maharzu). </i> that causes the bread to descend in peace. “He made you, and He established you [<i>vayekhonenekha</i>]” (Deuteronomy 32:6). He made you with everything that you need. After all this, “is it to the Lord that you do this,” you go and speak superfluous matters? <br>Another matter, “is it to the Lord that you do this?” He said to them: After He performed all these miracles on your behalf, you refuse Him? As it is written: “They were defiant at the sea, in the Red Sea” (Psalms 106:7); “at the sea,” on the seashore; “in the Red Sea,” in its plain sense. At that moment, the angel of the sea became filled with rage and sought to wash them away, until the Holy One blessed be He rebuked it and the water dried, as it is stated: “He rebukes the sea and dries it” (Nahum 1:4). And it says: “He rebuked the Red Sea and it dried” (Psalms 106:9). When Moses saw this, he led them from the sin at the sea. That is why it is stated: “Moses led Israel.”
Rabbi Yehuda says: Israel said at that time: ‘Is it not so, that the Holy One blessed be He took us out of Egypt only for five matters: First, to give us the plunder of Egypt; second, to bear us on the clouds of glory; third, to split the sea on our behalf; fourth, to take our vengeance from the Egyptians; fifth, to recite song before Him? Now, He has already given us the plunder of Egypt, borne us on the clouds of glory, split the sea on our behalf, taken our vengeance from the Egyptians, and we recited song before Him, let us return to Egypt.’ Moses said to them: ‘This is what the Omnipresent said to me: “For as you saw the Egyptians today, [you shall not see them ever again]”’ (Exodus 14:13). They said to him: ‘They have all died already. Let us return to Egypt.’ He said to them: ‘Let us repay our promissory note, for so said the Holy One blessed be He to me: “When you take the people out of Egypt, you will worship God upon this mountain”’ (Exodus 3:12). <br>Rabbi Elazar says: They did not travel by the word of the Almighty, but rather, Moses forced them to travel with a rod. Because they saw the carcasses of the Egyptians, who had enslaved them with mortar and bricks, floating on the water’s surface, they said: ‘No one remains in Egypt. “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt” (Numbers 14:4). Let us craft an idol and it will lead us and we will return to Egypt.’ Could it be that they spoke but did not act? The verse states: “They refused to heed and did not remember Your wonders” (Nehemiah 9:17). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai says: There was an idol in the possession of Israel and Moses removed it [<i>hisia</i>] from Israel. That is why it is stated: “Moses led [<i>vayasa</i>] Israel.”
Another matter, “Moses led Israel,” that is what is written: “He led His people like sheep” (Psalms 78:52). Like which sheep? Like the sheep of Yitro; just as the sheep of Yitro emerged from the settlement to the wilderness,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 3:1. </i> so, too, Israel emerged from Egypt to the wilderness, as it is stated: “He guided them like a flock in the wilderness” (Psalms 78:52). <br>Another matter, just as sheep do not enter the shelter of a roof, so too, the Holy One blessed be He led Israel for forty years in the wilderness. Another matter, just as one does not prepare stockpiles for sheep, but rather it grazes every day, so too, He did not prepare them a stockpile for Israel, but rather, [provided for them daily] in the wilderness, as it is stated: “The people will go out and gather [each day’s portion on its day]” (Exodus 16:4). <br>Another matter, just as a sheep, even if it damages the trees, its owners do not charge it, so too, Israel, even though they sin, the Holy One blessed be He treats them like sheep. If so, just as sheep do not receive reward, perhaps the same is true regarding Israel, as He called them sheep. The verse states: “Now you are My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are Man” (Ezekiel 34:31); sheep for punishment and man for the giving of reward. If so, just as a sheep is designated for slaughter, perhaps the same is true regarding Israel. The verse states: “Like consecrated sheep” (Ezekiel 36:38); just as anyone who touches consecrated items incurs liability, so too, Israel, as it is stated: “Israel is sacred to the Lord, the first of His crop, anyone who devours it will be guilty” (Jeremiah 2:3). <br>Just as a sheep, any place that the shepherd leads it, there it follows, so too, Israel, every place that Moses would lead them, they would follow him, as it is stated: “Draw me, after you we will run” (Song of Songs 1:4). That is why it is stated: “Moses led Israel from the Red Sea.” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: He led them away from the sin of the Red Sea, for once they recited song, the song atoned for their having sinned at the sea.
“To the wilderness of Shur.” We do not find that there is a wilderness whose name is Shur. What is [meant by] “the wilderness of Shur”? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is due to the merit of Abraham, with whom I spoke, and I said to him: “And also that nation that they will serve [I will judge, and afterwards they will emerge with great property]” (Genesis 15:14), and in whose regard it is written: “He settled between Kadesh and Shur” (Genesis 20:1). <br>Rabbi Avin said: What is [meant by] the wilderness of Shur? There Israel desired to be configured in rows [<i>shurot</i>] of banners. <br>Another matter, “the wilderness of Shur,” is the wilderness of Kuv. They said regarding the wilderness of Kuv that it is eight hundred parasangs and filled with snakes, fiery serpents, and scorpions. Rabbi Abba spoke before our Rabbi:<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> One time, a person passed through the wilderness of Kuv, and he saw a certain snake that was sleeping and it was as thick as the beam of an olive press. He saw the snake but the snake did not see him. Since he was so overcome with trepidation, he panicked and his hair fell out. They would call him the bald one. That is what Moses said to Israel: “Who guides you in the great and awesome wilderness; [snake, fiery serpent, and scorpion]?” (Deuteronomy 8:15). Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: We do not know regarding what it says “great,” whether it is regarding the Holy One blessed be He, or it is regarding the wilderness. But Moses said to them: ‘Great and awesome is God, whom you would anger, and you would walk in that wilderness that is filled with snakes, scorpions, fiery serpents, and famine, and He guided you through it in peace.’ Moreover, the snakes and the serpents would crouch before them<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">They would position themselves as though bowing in servitude and fear (Midrash HaMevoar). </i> so that Israel would not panic on their account. <br>Another matter, what is [meant by] “the wilderness of Shur”? Until Israel departed from Egypt, the world was a wilderness. When they departed, the world became a wall.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Initially, people felt that the world was like a wilderness in which anyone could come and do as he pleases. After Israel departed from Egypt, they felt as though the world was protected by a surrounding wall in the sense that there were boundaries and an authority, namely God.</i> Alternatively, until Israel received the Torah, the world conducted itself as a wilderness. When they received the Torah, the world became a wall, this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon. The Holy One blessed be He said: In the future, I will do so to Zion, which is a wilderness, as it is written: “Zion became a wilderness,” (Isaiah 64:9). But in the future, I will be a wall for it, as it is stated: “I will be for it, the utterance of the Lord, a wall of fire all around, and for glory I will be in its midst” (Zechariah 2:9).

Chapter 25

<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens and the people shall go out and gather each day’s portion on its day, so that I may test them, whether they will follow My Torah or not” (Exodus 16:4).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens.” That is what is written: “Anything that the Lord desires to do, He does, in the heavens and on the earth” (Psalms 135:6). Anything that the Holy One blessed be He seeks to do, He does, for everything is His in the heavens and on the earth. Reish Lakish said: When flesh and blood crafts a vessel with three compartments and places different sorts of liquids, each and every one by itself; is he able to pour them all out from one place? However, for the Holy One blessed be He it is not so. When He rained fire and brimstone upon the Sodomites it was from the heavens, as it is stated: “The Lord rained [brimstone and fire] upon Sodom [and upon Gomorrah from the Lord] from the heavens” (Genesis 19:24). Dew is from the heavens, as it is stated: “Like dew from the Lord” (Micah 5:6). And the manna was from the heavens. <br>This is analogous to a golden samovar; if one seeks cold water, he removes it from it, if he seeks coals, he removes it from it.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to a samovar that has a compartment for water and an adjacent compartment for coals. One can fill the samovar with cold water, or fill it with hot water and use hot coals to keep the water hot. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is to a samovar that has an additional compartment for cold water, further away from the coals. </i> So too, when the Holy One blessed be He brought the plagues upon the Egyptians, He brought them only from the heavens.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">He brought hail upon the Egyptians, comprised of both ice and fire (see Exodus 9:23). This is parallel to the cold water and hot coals from the samovar. </i> When He exacted retribution from the Emorites, He exacted retribution against them only from the heavens, as it is written: “The Lord cast upon them large stones from the heavens” (Joshua 10:11). When He exacted retribution from Sisera, He exacted retribution from him only from the heavens, as it is stated: “From the heavens they battled” (Judges 5:20). And when He bestows goodness upon Israel, He bestows goodness only from the heavens, as it is stated: “The Lord will open for you His good storehouse, the heavens” (Deuteronomy 28:12). The blessings are from the heavens, as it is stated: “Look from Your holy abode, from the heavens, [and bless Your people Israel]” (Deuteronomy 26:15).
Rabbi Simon began in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: “The Lord is the God of hosts [<i>tzevaot</i>], the Lord is His designation” (Hosea 12:6), He carries out His will [<i>tzivyono</i>] upon His creations. Alternatively, “the God of hosts,” he carries out His will upon His angels. When He wishes, He makes them sit, as it is stated: “An angel of God came and sat beneath the terebinth” (Judges 6:11). At times, He makes them stand, as it is stated: “Seraphs standing” (Isaiah 6:2). And it is written: “I will grant you movement among those standing” (Zechariah 3:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to angels standing.</i> At times He makes them in the guise of women, as it is stated: “Behold, two women emerged and wind was in their wings” (Zechariah 5:9), and at times, in the guise of men, as it is stated: “Behold three men” (Genesis 18:2). At times He makes them into winds, as it is stated: “He renders His angels winds” (Psalms 104:4), and at times, fire, as it is stated: “Flaming fires His servants” (Psalms 104:4). <br>Alternatively, “the Lord is the God of hosts [<i>tzevaot</i>],” He carries out His will [<i>tzivyono</i>] upon the world. When He wished, He produced bread from the earth, as it is stated: “To produce bread from the earth” (Psalms 104:14). He brought down water from the heavens, as it is stated: “From the rain of the heavens, it drinks water” (Deuteronomy 11:11). When He wished, He raised water from the earth, as it is stated: “Rise, well, call to it” (Numbers 21:17), and He brought down manna from the heavens, as it is stated: “Behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens.”
Another matter, “behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens,” that is what is written: “You open Your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living being” (Psalms 145:16). Come and see that the nature of flesh and blood is unlike the nature of the Holy One blessed be He. The nature of flesh and blood is that when a sponge is in his hand, if he opens his hand no drop falls, but if he clenches his hand, it causes water to fall. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so. The sponge is in His hand, as it is stated: “The streams [<i>peleg</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Peleg can also mean body part.</i> of God are filled with water” (Psalms 65:10), and likewise, “who measured water in His palm” (Isaiah 40:12). If He shuts it, the water does not come down, as it is stated: “Behold, He shuts the water and it dries” (Job 12:15), and it says: “He will shut the heavens and there will be no rain” (Deuteronomy 11:17). He opens His hand and the rain falls, as it is stated: “The Lord will open for you His good storehouse, the heavens [to provide rain for your land in its time]” (Deuteronomy 28:12). And it says: “You open Your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living being” (Psalms 145:16). <br>“The food of every living being,” is not written here, but rather, “the desire of every living being,” as He provides for the desire of each and every one. Likewise, in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will give each and every one everything that he seeks. If you wonder about this matter, see what He did for Israel in this world, as He brought down for them manna, in which there were all kinds of delicacies, and each and every one of Israel would taste anything that he wanted, as it is stated: “These forty years the Lord your God is with you, you lacked nothing [<i>davar</i>]” (Deuteronomy 2:7). What is <i>davar</i>? When one would desire to eat something [<i>davar</i>], and he would say so with his mouth: ‘If only I had a piece of fattened meat to eat,’ immediately, it would be transformed into the taste of fattened meat in his mouth. They would say a word [<i>davar</i>], and the Holy One blessed be He would fulfill their will. <br>Rabbi Abba said: He would not even say anything with his mouth, but rather would think in his heart what his soul desired and the Holy One blessed be He would fulfill his will, and he would taste the flavor of what he desired. Know that it is so, as Ezekiel said: “My bread that I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey I fed you” (Ezekiel 16:19). One verse says: “Behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens,” and one verse says: “And its taste was like a cake of honey” (Exodus 16:31), and it says: “Its taste was like the taste of cake baked with oil” (Numbers 11:8). How are the three verses realized? Lads would taste the taste of bread; elders, the taste of honey; babies, the taste of oil.
Another matter, “Behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens,” that is what is written: “I responded to those who did not ask” (Isaiah 65:1). What is written prior to the matter? “The entire congregation of the children of Israel complained” (Exodus 16:2). What complaint was there? The food that they took out with them from Egypt made them sixty-one meals, and they ate it for thirty-one days. That dough was finished and in the evening they complained, as it is stated: “The entire congregation of the children of Israel complained.” They should have come to say to him: ‘That dough is finished.’ Instead, they came to him contentiously, and said: “For you have taken us out of Egypt to this wilderness to kill this entire assembly in famine” (Exodus 16:3). They said: ‘Famine of food and famine of water.’ When they complained, [God’s] anger should have emerged against them immediately, but He did not do so to them. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘They acted characteristically,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Contrarian and complaining.</i> and I will act characteristically.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Merciful and forgiving.</i> Say to them: In the morning the manna will fall for you.’ That is, “I responded to those who did not ask.” It would have been appropriate for them, once their cake was finished, that they would stand and request mercy from before Me. Instead, they stood and poured out grievances toward Heaven. Therefore, the verse states: “Behold Me, behold Me, to a nation that did not invoke My name” (Isaiah 65:1). Why does it say “behold Me” twice? Behold, it was Me at the spring, as it is stated: “Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock” (Exodus 17:6). And behold, it was I [who provided] the manna, as it is stated: “Behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens.”
Another matter, “behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens,” that is what is written: “Cast your bread upon the water, for after many days you will find it” (Ecclesiastes 11:1). Rabbi Ḥanin said: When the Holy One blessed be He called Abraham, he answered Him: “He said: Here I am [<i>hineni</i>]” (Genesis 22:1). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, with that same expression I will reward your descendants,’ as it is stated: “Behold, I [<i>hineni</i>] will rain down bread for you from the heavens.” In his regard, the verse says: “He who walks wholeheartedly is a righteous man” (Proverbs 20:7), this is Abraham, in whose regard it is written: “Walk before Me, and be wholehearted.” (Genesis 17:1). <br>“Happy are his children after him” (Proverbs 20:7). You find that everything that Abraham our patriarch performed himself for the ministering angels, the Holy One blessed be He performed for his descendants in the wilderness. He said: “Let a little water be taken” (Genesis 18:4) by means of an intermediary. The Holy One blessed be He provided water by means of an intermediary. From where is this derived? As it is stated: “Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock” (Exodus 17:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than God providing water for the Israelites directly, He commanded Moses to strike the rock and cause water to emerge.</i> [Abraham] said: “And wash your feet” (Genesis 18:4), and He repaid them in the wilderness, as it is stated: “I will bathe you in water” (Ezekiel 16:9). [Abraham] said: “And recline beneath the tree” (Genesis 18:4), and the Holy One blessed be He “spread a cloud like a curtain” (Psalms 105:39). [Abraham] accompanied them, as it is stated: “Abraham was going with them to see them off” (Genesis 18:16), and the Holy One blessed be He repaid his descendants, as it is stated: “And the Lord was going before them by day” (Exodus 13:21). [Abraham] said: “I will fetch a piece of bread” (Genesis 18:5), and the Holy One blessed be He said: “Behold, I will rain down bread for you.” Rabbi Yehuda Halevi ben Rabbi Shalom said in the name of Rabbi Yona, and also Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina: The manna should have fallen for them for [all of their] forty-two journeys. Where did it [begin to] fall? It was at Alush. Why at Alush? It was due to the merit that Abraham said: “Knead [<i>lushi</i>] and prepare cakes” (Genesis 18:6), that the Holy One blessed be He repaid his descendants: “Behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens.”
Another matter, “behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens,” that is what is written: “There is none like You among the gods, Lord, and there are no deeds like Yours” (Psalms 86:8). Why is there none like You among the gods? Because there are none who can perform Your deeds. How so? The way of the world is that flesh and blood make a path on the way; is he, perhaps, able to make a path in the sea? But for the Holy One blessed be He it is not so, but rather, He makes for Himself a path in the midst of the sea, as it is stated: “Your way was through the sea, Your path through the mighty waters, Your footprints left no trace” (Psalms 77:20). Flesh and blood examine their documents. If someone finds that people owe him, he will produce the document and collect from them, but if he finds that he is in debt to a person, he will suppress it and not produce it. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so. If He finds that we are in debt to Him He suppresses it, as it is stated: “He will again have mercy upon us; He will suppress our iniquities” (Micah 7:19). But if He finds merit for us, He produces it, as it is stated: “The Lord has produced our righteousness” (Jeremiah 51:10). <br>Flesh and blood, when he seeks to build a palace, he builds the lower levels and afterward builds the upper levels. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so; after He created the upper levels, He created the lower levels, as it is stated: “In the beginning God created the heavens,” and only afterward, “and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). Flesh and blood, when he seeks to purchase a slave, if there are claimants,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Individuals who claim that the slave belongs to them rather than to the individual seeking to sell the slave.</i> he does not purchase him, but the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather He says: “Or has a god sought to come and take for himself a nation from the midst of a nation?” (Deuteronomy 4:34). Flesh and blood, the disciple holds the torch before his master, but the Holy One blessed be He is not so: “The Lord was going before them by day [in a pillar of cloud, to guide them on the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to illuminate for them]” (Exodus 13:21). Flesh and blood, the servant bathes the master, but the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather, “I will bathe you in water” (Ezekiel 16:9). Flesh and blood would dress his master, but the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather, “I clothed you in embroidery” (Ezekiel 16:10). Flesh and blood places shoes on the feet of his master, but the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather, “and shod you with taḥash” (Ezekiel 16:10). Flesh and blood bears his master, but the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather, “I have borne you on the wings of eagles” (Exodus 19:4). Flesh and blood, the master sleeps and the servant stands over him, but the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather, the Holy One blessed be He protects Israel, as it is stated: “Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4). For flesh and blood, water is from above them and bread is from below them,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rain falls from the sky and wheat grows from the ground. </i> but the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather, water is from below them, this is the well,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The well that miraculously accompanied Israel through the wilderness and provided them with water. </i> as it is stated: “Rise, well…” (Numbers 21:17), and the bread is from above: “Behold, I will rain down [bread] for you [from the heavens].” That is, “there is none like You among the gods, Lord, and there are no deeds like Yours” (Psalms 86:8).
Another matter, “behold, I will rain down bread for you.” That is what is written: “Come, partake of my bread, and drink of the wine I have mixed” (Proverbs 9:5). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘What caused you to eat of the manna and to drink from the spring? It is because you accepted the statutes and the ordinances, just as it states: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances…” (Exodus 15:25). It is due to the merit of My bread<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the Torah, which is compared to bread (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> that you took the bread of the manna, and due to the merit of the wine that I mixed<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the Torah, which is compared to wine (see Song of Songs 1:2; <i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> that you drank the water of the spring, as it is stated: “And drink of the wine I have mixed.”’ <br>Why did they not recite song over the manna, just as they recited it over the spring? It is because regarding the manna they expressed derogatory statements, as it is stated: “But now our soul is parched, there is nothing at all, other than the manna before our eyes” (Numbers 11:6). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I seek neither your grievances nor your lauding,’ therefore He granted them permission to recite song only over the spring, because they were fond of it, as it is stated: “Rise, well, call to it” (Numbers 21:17). <br>Another matter, “behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens,” that is what is written: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies” (Psalms 23:5). When did the children of Israel state this matter? It was when they departed from Egypt and the nations of the world were saying: ‘These are destined to perish in the wilderness,’ and [Israel] said: “Is God able to prepare a table in the wilderness?” (Psalms 78:19). <br>What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He had them recline [<i>hesiban</i>] under the clouds of glory, as it is stated: “God led the people roundabout [<i>vayasev</i>]” (Exodus 13:18), and he fed them manna, as it is stated: “Who fed you manna in the wilderness” (Deuteronomy 8:16). The height of the manna was higher than the waters of the Flood, as it is stated: “He commanded the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens” (Psalms 78:23), and regarding the Flood it is written: “And the windows of the heavens were opened” (Genesis 7:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Doors in the time of the Sages had four windows. Thus, if the waters of the Flood came through windows, and an unclarified plural term implies two, and the manna came through doors, the implication is that the manna was more plentiful than the waters of the Flood (see <i>Yoma</i> 76a). </i> The nations of the world were seeing Israel reclining, eating, and lauding the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies” (Psalms 23:5). “You anoint my head with oil” (Psalms 23:5), this is the quail. “My cup is full” (Psalms 23:5), this is the spring. Likewise, in the future, He will make peace for them, and they will recline and eat in the Garden of Eden. The idolaters will see their conduct and their manner <a variant reading: And they will melt>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Their hearts will melt due to jealousy or fear.</i> as it is stated: “Behold, My servants will drink and you will be thirsty, [behold, My servants will rejoice and you will be ashamed]” (Isaiah 65:13).
Another matter, “behold, I will rain down bread for you.” That is what is written: “He will dwell On High…[his bread is given, his waters assured]” (Isaiah 33:16). That is what is written: “He raises the poor from dust” (I Samuel 2:8), these are Israel, who were sunken in mortar and bricks in Egypt, and the Holy One blessed be He took them out with their heads held high, as it is stated: “I led you out with your heads held high” (Leviticus 26:13), that is, “He raises the poor from dust.” <br>The Holy One blessed be He set limits for Jacob and said to him: “Your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth” (Genesis 28:14). When your descendants reach the dust of the earth, at that moment: “You shall spread westward and eastward” (Genesis 28:14), that is, “He raises the poor from dust.” The Holy One blessed be He elevated them above everything, as it is stated: “The Lord your God [will set you above all the nations of the world]” (Deuteronomy 28:1). See what is written: “In the wilderness where you saw that the Lord your God bore you” (Deuteronomy 1:31). He said to them: ‘I have elevated you above the entire world. If you will fulfill My will, I will place you in what I created before the world was created, namely the Temple, as it is stated: “Throne of glory, exalted from the beginning is the place of our Temple” (Jeremiah 17:12), there I will elevate you, as it is stated: “And He will bequeath them the throne of glory” (I Samuel 2:8). At that time, I will provide you with the delicacies of the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You”’ (Psalms 31:20). That is why it said: “He will dwell On High” (Isaiah 33:16). <br>Another matter, “He will dwell On High,” that is what is written: “For the Lord your God is bringing you to a good and expansive land” (Deuteronomy 8:7),<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The verse actually states “a good land” without “and expansive.” The phrase “a good and expansive land” is found in Exodus 3:8. </i> to see a table that is set in the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “I walk before the Lord in the land of the living” (Psalms 116:9). As it were, He is reclining above the patriarchs, and the patriarchs and all the righteous are in His midst [<i>betokho</i>], as it is stated: “They sit [<i>tuku</i>] at Your feet” (Deuteronomy 33:3), and He distributes portions to them. If you are astonished by this matter, did He not, in this world, recline for them between the two cherubs, as it is stated: “He will lie between my breasts” (Song of Songs 1:13), all the more so in the Garden of Eden. He brings them fruit from the Garden of Eden and He feeds them from the Tree of Life. <br>Who recites the blessing first? Everyone defers to the Holy One blessed be He that He should designate the one to recite the blessing, and the Holy One blessed be He says to Mikhael: ‘Recite the blessing.’ He says to Gavriel,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Mikhael tells Gavriel to recite the blessing.</i> and Gavriel to the patriarchs of the world,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</i> and they defer to Moses and Aaron, and they to the elders. They defer to David and say: ‘Let the king on earth bless the King in Heaven.’ They give David the cup, and he says: “I will lift a cup of salvation, and I will call in the name of the Lord” (Psalms 116:13). In their regard,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">With regard to those who deferred to him. </i> David praised and said: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20). That is, “for the Lord your God is bringing you” (Deuteronomy 8:7). In that regard it is stated: “He will dwell On High.” <br>Another matter, “He will dwell On High,” that is what is written: “The wing of the songbird beats joyously [are its pinions and plumage of a stork?] For it leaves its eggs on the earth [and warms them on dust. And it forgets that a foot may crush it or a beast of the field trample it]. It is harsh to its young, as though they are not from it [its toil is in vain without fear. For God deprived it of wisdom and did not allot understanding to it]. In time, it will soar on high [and scoff at the horse and its rider]” (Job 39:13–18). This is analogous to a stork that would lay her eggs on the dust of the earth, and the passersby trampled it and destroyed it. What caused it? It is because it would lay its eggs on the ground. But if it would ascend on high and lay its eggs there, no creature would harm it, but rather, it would scoff at everything. <br>So too Israel, “the wing of the songbird [<i>renanim</i>] beats joyously [<i>ne’elasa</i>].” “Wing” – “I will spread My wing over you” (Ezekiel 16:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">This verse, stated regarding Israel, indicates that the term “wing” in the verse in Job also refers to Israel. </i>” “The songbird [<i>renanim</i>]” – “rejoice in the Lord, righteous ones” (Psalms 33:1). “Joyously [<i>ne’elasa</i>]” – “let us delight [<i>nitalsa</i>] ourselves in lovemaking” (Proverbs 7:18). “Are its pinions [<i>evra</i>]” – “I said: Would that I had wings [<i>ever</i>] like a dove” (Psalms 55:7). “Stork” – “Even the stork in the heavens knows its appointed times” (Jeremiah 8:7). “For it leaves [<i>taazov</i>] its eggs on the earth” – “I have abandoned [<i>azavti</i>] My house” (Jeremiah 12:7). “And warms them on dust” – “Our soul is prostrated to the dust” (Psalms 44:26). “And it forgets that a foot may crush it” – “You forgot the Lord, your Maker” (Isaiah 51:13). “Or a beast of the field trample it,” these are the idolaters, as it is stated: “He rendered them like dust to be trampled” (II Kings 13:7). “It is harsh to its young [<i>baneha</i>], as though they are not from it” – “they are foolish children [<i>banim</i>]” (Jeremiah 4:22). “Its toil [<i>yegia</i>] is in vain” – “I am weary [<i>yagati</i>] with my groaning” (Psalms 6:7). “Without fear” – “they did not fear” (Jeremiah 36:24). “For God deprived it of wisdom” – “For My people is stupid, they do not know Me; they are foolish children, and they have no understanding; they are wise to perform evil” (Jeremiah 4:22). “And did not allot understanding to it” – “and they have no understanding” (Jeremiah 4:22). <br>Why all these?<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Why are all these negative things stated concerning Israel? </i> It is because they have forsaken the Holy One blessed be He. However, when they repent and direct their eyes On High, just as it says: “To You, enthroned in Heaven, I lift my eyes” (Psalms 123:1), then “in time, it will soar on high” – “To place the lowly On High” (Job 5:11). “And scoff at the horse and its rider” – “these on chariots and those on horses, but we invoke the name of the Lord our God” (Psalms 20:8). That is, “He will dwell On High.” <br>Another matter, “He will dwell On High,” this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Exalted and holy I will dwell” (Isaiah 57:15). “Rocky citadels are His stronghold” (Isaiah 33:16), this is David, as it is stated: “The Lord is my rock and my fortress” (Psalms 18:3). “His bread is given” (Isaiah 33:16), this is Abraham, as it is stated: “I will take a piece of bread” (Genesis 18:5). “His water assured,” this is the Torah, as it is stated: “Ho, everyone thirsty, go to water” (Isaiah 55:1). <br>Another matter, “his bread is given,” this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He gives bread to all flesh, for His kindness is forever” (Psalms 136:25). “His water assured,” as it is stated: “He covers His upper chambers with water” (Psalms 104:3). <br>Another matter, “his bread is given,” this is the manna, as it is stated: “Behold, I will rain down bread for you from the heavens.” “His water assured,” as it is stated: “Rise, well, call to it” (Numbers 21:17). <br>Another matter, “his bread is given, his water assured,” this is the Holy One blessed be He, who orders those well-versed in Torah: ‘Do not say regarding what you have not heard, I heard.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Do not claim to have heard from your teacher something that you did not hear from him. </i> Do not prohibit for others and permit for yourself. Rather, let [your words] emerge from your mouth truthfully, just as they emerged from Moses’s mouth, and I will show you beauty face to face,’ as it is stated: “Your eyes will behold a king in his beauty” (Isaiah 33:17). Israel said: ‘How can we see Your face? Did you not deliver us into the hand of Edom, of whom it is stated: “Fearsome, terrifying”’ (Daniel 7:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In Daniel’s vision, Edom is represented by a terrifying beast. </i> [God] said to them: ‘Do not fear them, as you are destined to say to Me: Where are they?’ That is what is written: “You will not see a daring people” (Isaiah 33:19), and you will see the rejoicing of Zion, as it is stated: “Look upon Zion, city of our festivals; your eyes will see Jerusalem, a tranquil abode” (Isaiah 33:20).
“And the people shall go out and gather each day’s portion on its day” (Exodus 16:4). That is what is written: “Blessed be the Lord, day by day” (Psalms 68:20). The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘In accordance with the measure that a person metes, so it is meted for him; I gave you the Torah in which you engage each day, as it is stated: “Happy is the man who heeds Me, to persist at My gates each day” (Proverbs 8:34). Likewise, “they seek Me each day” (Isaiah 58:2). As you live, I will sate you with bread from the heavens each day, as it is stated: “And the people shall go out and gather each day’s portion on its day, so that I may test them, whether they will follow My Torah…” (Exodus 16:4). Moreover, I bless you each, as it is stated: “Blessed be the Lord, day by day, He will provide [<i>yaamos</i>] for us day after day” (Psalms 68:20). When you perform My will, I call you: “Those borne [<i>haamusim</i>] by Me from birth” (Isaiah 46:3), and I will provide [<i>maamis</i>] you with a cup of salvation, due to the merit of the Temple,’ which is known as “a stone of burden [<i>maamasa</i>],” as it is stated: “It will be on that day, that I will render Jerusalem a stone of burden” (Zechariah 12:3).
<b>“But they did not heed Moses; men left from it until the morning and it became infested with worms and stank, and Moses became angry with them” (Exodus 16:20).</b> <br>“Men left from it,” these were those among them who lacked faith. Who were they? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: They were Datan and Aviram. Here, “men” is stated, and below “men” is stated, as it is stated: “Depart now from the tents of these wicked men” (Numbers 16:26). Just as the “men” stated below were Datan and Aviram, so, too, the “men” stated here were Datan and Aviram. <br>“And it became infested with worms and stank.” Is there anything that first produces worms and then stinks? Rather, the Holy One blessed be He sought to show people their actions, [and therefore ensured] that it would not stink at night and they would get up and cast it away; rather, that whole night it produced rows upon rows of worms.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">In this way, God ensured that those who had left over the manna would throw it out in the morning, when others were awake and would notice. The large number of worms spread, and caused many people to know about the sin of these individuals. </i> Immediately, “Moses became angry with them.” <br><b>“It was on the sixth day that they gathered double the bread, two <i>omer</i> for each and all the princes of the congregation came and told Moses” (Exodus 16:22). <br>“And he said to them, This is that which the Lord has spoken: Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Shabbat to the Lord: bake that which you will bake today, and what you will boil, boil today; and that which remains over, lay up for you, to be kept until the morning” (Exodus 16:23). <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Until when do you refuse to observe My commandments and My laws?” (Exodus 16:28).</b> <br>When he became angry, he forgot to tell them that they should gather two <i>omer </i>each on the sixth day. When they went and gathered on the sixth day and found double, the princes came and told Moses, as it is stated: “All the princes of the congregation came and told Moses.” What did he say to them? “This is what the Lord has spoken.” It does not say: “This is what I have spoken,” but rather, “He has spoken,” for [Moses] had forgotten. In that regard it is stated: “Until when do you refuse,” as He includes Moses among them.
<b>“See that the Lord has given you the Shabbat; therefore, He gives you on the sixth day bread for two days. Remain each man where he is; no man shall leave his place on the seventh day (Exodus 16:29).</b> <br>“See that the Lord has given you the Shabbat.” It should have said “know.” What is “see”? Rather, this is what the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘If the idolaters were to come and say to you: Why do you observe the Shabbat day on this day, say to them: See that the manna does not fall on Shabbat.’ <br>What is “has given you”? To you it is given, and not to idolaters. From here they said: If idolaters will come and observe Shabbat, not only do they not receive a reward, [they also deserve to be put to death], as it is stated: “And day and night will not cease [<i>yishbotu</i>]” (Genesis 8:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is interpreted to mean: They shall not observe a day and night of Shabbat. </i> Likewise it says: “Between Me and the children of Israel [it is a sign forever]” (Exodus 31:17). This is analogous to a king who is sitting and the queen is sitting opposite him; one who passes between them is liable.
Rabbi Levi said: If Israel observes Shabbat properly, even one day, the son of David<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The Messiah.</i> will come. Why? Because it is equivalent to all the mitzvot. Likewise it says: “For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture and the flock of His hand; today, would you only heed His voice” (Psalms 95:7). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Even though I set a limit for the end, and it will come whether they repent or do not repent, it will come only at its time. If they repent, even one day, I will bring it not at its appointed time. That is, “today, would you only heed His voice.” Just as we saw that for all the mitzvot, the son of David comes, for the observance of one day of Shabbat, the son of David comes, because Shabbat is equivalent to all mitzvot. <br>Rabbi Elazar bar Avina said: We find in the Torah, in the Prophets, and in the Writings that Shabbat is equivalent to all the mitzvot. In the Torah, from where is it derived? From the fact that when Moses forgot to tell them the mitzva of Shabbat, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Until when do you refuse to observe My commandments…” (Exodus 16:28). What is written thereafter? “See that the Lord has given you the Shabbat” (Exodus 16:28). In the prophets, from where is it derived? From that which is stated: “The house of Israel defied Me in the wilderness, they did not follow My statutes” (Ezekiel 20:13). What is written thereafter? “They desecrated My Shabbats” (Ezekiel 20:13). In the Writings, from where is it derived? From that which is stated: “You came down upon Mount Sinai and spoke to them [from heaven and gave them upright ordinances and laws of truth, good statutes and mitzvot]” (Nehemiah 9:13). What is written thereafter? “You informed them of Your holy Shabbat” (Nehemiah 9:14). The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘If you merit to observe Shabbat, I consider it for you as though you observed all the mitzvot<i> </i>of the Torah. If you desecrate it, I consider it for you as though you desecrated all the mitzvot.’ Likewise, it says: “Who keeps the Shabbat from its desecration and prevents his hand from performing any evil” (Isaiah 56:2). <br>When a person observes the Shabbat, he issues a decree and the Holy One blessed be He fulfills it, as it is stated: "If you restrain your walking because of the Sabbath” (Isaiah 58:13). What is written thereafter? “Then you will delight in the Lord” (Isaiah 58:14), just as it says: “Delight in the Lord, and He will grant you the desires of your heart.” (Psalms 37:4). Moreover, everything that you eat in this world is only from the profits, but the principal remains for the World to Come, as it is stated: “I will feed you the inheritance of Jacob your forefather, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken” (Isaiah 58:14).

Chapter 26

“Amalek came [and waged war with Israel in Refidim]” (Exodus 17:8), that is what is written: “I was not serene, was not silent, and I did not rest, but turmoil came” (Job 3:26). “I was not serene” due to Babylon; “was not silent” due to Media; “I did not rest” due to Greece; “but turmoil came” through Edom. Alternatively, “I was not serene” due to the first edict that Pharaoh decreed against me, as it is stated: “They embittered their lives” (Exodus 1:14), and the Holy One blessed be He provided a redeemer for them, namely Miriam, named for the bitterness [<i>merur</i>]. “Was not silent” due to the second edict: “If it is a son put him to death” (Exodus 1:16), and the Holy One blessed be He provided a redeemer, namely Aaron, named for pregnancy [<i>herayon</i>]. “I did not rest” due to the third edict that he decreed, saying: “Every son that is born cast him into the Nile” (Exodus 1:22), and the Holy One blessed be He provided a redeemer, named for the water. This is Moses, as it is stated: “As I drew him [<i>meshitihu</i>] from the water” (Exodus 2:10). “But turmoil came,” this is Amalek.
“Amalek came.” What is written prior to the matter? “The entire congregation of the children of Israel traveled…there was no water for the people to drink” (Exodus 17:1). For the people there was not, but for the flocks and the cattle there was.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The water was fit for animals to drink but not for people. </i> Immediately they came to engage in a dispute with Moses and said to him: “Why did you take us up out of Egypt [to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst]?” (Exodus 17:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This was unnecessarily quarrelsome, as there was actually water for the animals. </i> From here, Rabbi Yehoshua would say: The house collapsed; too bad about the windows –“I and my livestock with thirst” (Exodus 17:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehoshua noted that when people complain, they often complain even about matters that are relatively minor compared to the primary concern. Similarly, after complaining that they would die, the Israelites also added that their animals would die as well. </i> Some say that a person’s animal is nothing other than his life;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">They complained about the animals’ safety because the safety of one’s animals ensures the safety of one’s own life. </i> when a person sets out on the road, if his animal is not with him, he will suffer. <br>Immediately, Moses stood in prayer, as it is stated: “Moses cried out to the Lord, saying” (Exodus 17:4). What is “saying”? He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, inform me whether or not they will kill me.’ He said to him: ‘What concern is it of yours? “Pass before the people”’ (Exodus 17:5). What is “pass [<i>avor</i>]”? He said to him: ‘Overlook [<i>avor</i>] their words.’ Rabbi Meir says: What is <i>avor</i>? He said: ‘Emulate Me. Just as I repay evil with good, you, too, repay evil with good,’ as it is stated: “Who is a God like You, Who pardons iniquity and overlooks [<i>veover</i>] transgression” (Micah 7:18). Rabbi Yehuda says: Pardon [<i>avor</i>] their sins. Rabbi Neḥemya says: “Pass before the people,”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">No need to fear them. Pass before them confidently.</i> let one who has haughtiness come and speak against you. <br><b>“The Lord said to Moses: Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go” (Exodus 17:5).</b> <br>“Take with you some of the elders of Israel,” so they will be witnesses, so they will not say to you: ‘There were springs there.’ “Your staff with which you struck the Nile,” he said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, this staff is a staff of punishment. It rendered the water in Egypt putrid and it brought the ten plagues upon the Egyptians.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘My nature is not like the nature of flesh and blood. He strikes with a chisel and heals with a bandage, but I, with what I strike, I heal.’ That is why it says: “And take in your hand your staff with which you struck the Nile,” so that everyone will know that it is [a staff] of blessing. <br><b>“Behold, I am standing before you there upon the rock at Ḥorev; you shall strike the rock and water will emerge from it, and the people will drink. Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel” (Exodus 17:6). <br>“He called the place Masa and Meriva, due to the dispute of the children of Israel and due to their trying of the Lord, saying: Is the Lord in our midst, or not?” (Exodus 17:7).</b> <br>“You shall strike the rock.” What is “you shall strike the rock”? The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘If they request from this rock, produce it for them, and if from that rock give it to them.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It did not matter which rock was chosen. This was so that the Israelites could not claim that Moses had brought forth water naturally from a rock with a hidden water source. </i> When the water emerged, it provided for all the tents of Israel. <br>What is written there? “He called the place Masa and Meriva” (Exodus 17:7). What dispute [<i>meriva</i>] was there? Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda says: They said: ‘If He is Master over all creations just as He is Master over us, we will worship Him, but if not, we will rebel against Him.’ Rabbi Neḥemya says [they said]: ‘If He provides us our sustenance like a king who is present in the province, and the residents of the province do not require anything from him, we will worship Him, but if not, we will rebel against Him.’ The Rabbis say [they said]: ‘If we contemplate in our heart and He knows what we are contemplating, we will worship Him, but if not, we will rebel against Him.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘If you sought to challenge Me, let the wicked one come and challenge you.’ Immediately, “Amalek came.” What is written there? “Is the Lord in our midst, or not? Amalek came” (Exodus 17:7–8). How does this relate to that? It is analogous to a child who was riding on his father’s shoulders and saw his father’s friend. He said to him: ‘Have you seen father?’ His father said to him: ‘You are riding on my shoulders and you ask about me? I will cast you down and the enemy will come and dominate you.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘I bore you on clouds of glory and you say: “Is the Lord in our midst”? Therefore, let the enemy come and dominate you.’ That is, “Amalek came.”
<b>“Moses said to Joshua: Choose men for us and go out and wage war with Amalek; tomorrow I will be standing on top of the hill and the staff of God will be in my hand” (Exodus 17:9).</b> <br>“Moses said to Joshua: Choose men for us.” Why to Joshua? Primarily, you expound that he was seeking to instruct him in war because he was destined to take Israel into the Land. <br>Another matter, why Joshua? He said to him: ‘It was by means of your grandfather<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua was from the tribe of Ephraim, who was a son of Joseph. The Israelites descended to Egypt due to the strife between Joseph and his brothers. </i> that they descended to Egypt, go and engage in war with the one who attacked them in their ascent from Egypt.’ <br>Another matter, why Joshua? He said to him: ‘Your grandfather said: “I fear God” (Genesis 42:18), and regarding this one<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Amalek.</i> it is written: “And not God-fearing” (Deuteronomy 25:18). Let the grandson of the one who said: “I fear God,” come and exact vengeance from the one in whose regard it is stated: “And not God-fearing.”’ <br>“Choose men for us.” What is the meaning of “men”? Men of wisdom and who fear sin. <br>“Go out and wage war with Amalek,” from here you learn that they were beneath the clouds of glory, as one says “go out” only to those who are located inside. <br>“The staff of God will be in my hand.” He said to him: ‘This staff is in my hand, as the Omnipresent said that it should be in my hand always.’ <br>Another matter, “the staff of God will be in my hand.” ‘When Aaron performed miracles with it, it was called by his name, as it is stated: “The staff of Aaron” (Exodus 7:12). When I performed miracles with it, it was called by my name. When the Holy One blessed be He performs miracles, it is called by His name, as it is stated: “The staff of God.”’ <br>

Chapter 27

<b>“Yitro, priest of Midian, father-in-law of Moses, heard everything that God had performed on behalf of Moses and Israel His people, that the Lord had taken Israel out of Egypt” (Exodus 18:1).</b> <br>“Yitro…heard.” That is what is written: “Do not forsake your friend, and your father’s friend. [Do not enter your brother’s house on the day of your calamity. A close neighbor is better than a distant brother]” (Proverbs 27:10). “Your friend,” this is the Holy One blessed be He, just as it says: “For the sake of My brothers and friends” (Psalms 122:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God calls Israel His “brothers and friends.”</i> “Your father’s friend,” this is Abraham, as it is stated: “The descendants of Abraham My beloved” (Isaiah 41:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, God is referred to both as “your friend” and as “your father’s friend.” </i> “Do not forsake,” and if you forsake, make certain that you “do not enter your brother’s house on the day of your calamity,” this is Ishmael and Esau.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Even if Israel suffers calamity, they should not abandon their identity and join with their “brothers,” Ishmael and Esau (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When Nebuchadnezzar exiled Israel to Babylon their [hands] were bound behind them, as it is written in <i>Midrash Eikha<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">2:4.</i> </i>until “for they wandered due to swords” (Isaiah 21:15). Your ancestor, who was cast in the wilderness, I opened a spring of water for him, and you did this?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God says to Ishmael: ‘I saved you in the wilderness (see Genesis 21:19), yet you caused the Israelites to die of thirst? (see <i>Eikha Rabba</i>, 2:4). </i> That is, “a close neighbor is better than a distant brother.” <br>Another matter, “a close neighbor is better,” this is Yitro, who was unrelated to Israel, [who was better] than Esau, Jacob’s brother. Regarding Yitro, what is written? “Saul said to the Kenite:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Kenite are the descendants of Yitro, who was Moses’ father-in-law (see Judges 1:16). </i> [Go, depart, descend from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they ascended from Egypt]” (I Samuel 15:6). Regarding Esau, it is written: “Remember what Amalek did to you…” (Deuteronomy 25:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Amalek was descended from Esau. </i> You find many matters written in a derogatory manner regarding Esau that are written in a complimentary manner regarding Yitro. Regarding Esau it is written: “They tormented women in Zion” (Lamentations 5:11). Regarding Yitro it is written: “He gave Tzipora, his daughter, [to him as a wife]” (Exodus 2:21). Regarding Esau it is written: “They, who devour my people as if eating bread” (Psalms 14:4). Regarding Yitro it is written: “Call him and let him eat bread” (Exodus 2:20). Regarding Esau it is written: “And not God-fearing” (Deuteronomy 25:18). Regarding Yitro it is written: “And God will command you” (Exodus 18:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is regarding Yitro’s advice to Moses to appoint a judicial system. Yitro advised Moses to heed the command of God. </i> Esau annulled the offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Rome, associated with Esau, destroyed the Temple. </i> Regarding Yitro it is written: “Yitro, Moses’s father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and feast-offerings” (Exodus 18:12). Esau heard of Israel’s departure and waged war with them, as it is stated: “Amalek came [and waged war with Israel in Refidim]” (Exodus 17:8). Yitro heard Israel’s praise and came and joined them, as it is stated: “Yitro…heard.”
Another matter, “Yitro…heard,” that is what is written: “The wise will inherit honor” (Proverbs 3:35), this is Yitro; when he came to Moses he inherited great honor. “He said to Moses: I, your father-in-law Yitro, am coming to you, [and your wife and her two sons with her]” (Exodus 18:6). Rabbi Yehoshua says: He sent a messenger to him. Rabbi Eliezer says: He sent him a letter and said: ‘Act for my sake. If you do not act for my sake, do it for your wife’s sake. If you do not act for her sake, act for the sake of your sons.’ Rabbi Eliezer says: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Go out.’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He interprets the verse to mean not that Yitro sent a message to Moses informing him of Yitro’s arrival, but that God, referred to here as “I,” informed Moses of Yitro’s arrival. </i> “He said to Moses,” the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘It is I who spoke and the world came into being,’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">That is why the term “I” in the verse refers to God. </i> as it is stated: “The Almighty God, the Lord, has spoken, calling the earth” (Psalms 50:1). It is I who brings near and it is I who distances, as it is stated: “Am I God from near, the utterance of the Lord, [but not God from afar?]” (Jeremiah 23:23). It is I who brought Yitro near and did not distance him. This person who came to Me came only in the name of Heaven, and came only to convert; you too, bring him near and do not distance him. Immediately, “Moses emerged to greet his father-in-law” (Exodus 18:7). [The Sages] said: Moses emerged,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 18:7. </i> Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel emerged. Some say: Even the Ark emerged with them. That is why it is stated: “The wise will inherit honor.”
Another matter, “Yitro…heard.” See how much goodness and blessing came to Yitro from the time that he became associated through marriage with Moses. What is written? “Aaron and all the elders of Israel came” (Exodus 18:12). Likewise, you find that when Bilam came to curse Israel, not only did he not curse them, but he blessed them. Moreover, when he saw Amalek, he began to curse it, as it is stated: “He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said: Amalek was the first of the nations; but its end will be oblivion” (Numbers 24:20). However, what does he say regarding Yitro? “He saw the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said: Mighty is your dwelling; set your nest in a rock” (Numbers 24:21). He said to him: ‘Kenite, you participated with us in the counsel;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Pharaoh convened advisers, including both Yitro and Bilam, to counsel him how to deal with the Israelites (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:9). </i> who seated you with the mighty of the world?’ This is analogous to a bird that fled from the hunter and fell into the hands of a royal statue.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The hunter would be unable to catch it there due to the care one must exhibit with regard to a royal statue. </i> When the hunter saw it he began lauding it and said to it: ‘What a fine flight that you fled.’ So too, Bilam was praising Yitro and said to him: “Mighty is your dwelling.”
Another matter, “Yitro…heard,” that is what is written: “Lord, my strength and my stronghold and my refuge on the day of trouble, to You nations will come from the ends of the earth” (Jeremiah 16:19). Israel said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘When You performed miracles on our behalf at the sea, we said to You: “The Lord is my strength [<i>uzi</i>] and song” (Exodus 15:2). Did Raḥav not hear and adhere to You? As it is stated: “She said to the men: I know that the Lord has given you the land…as we heard that the Lord dried the waters of the Red Sea”’ (Joshua 2:9–10). That is, “Lord, my strength and my stronghold and my refuge on the day of trouble.” ‘When You performed miracles in the days of Solomon, as it is stated: “He will give strength [<i>oz</i>] to His king” (I Samuel 2:10), did the Queen of Sheba not come and praise You? As it is stated: “The Queen of Sheba heard Solomon’s reputation” (I Kings 10:1). What did she say? “May the Lord your God be blessed, Who has chosen you” (I Kings 10:9). When You took us out of Egypt and gave us the Torah, which is called <i>oz</i>, as it is stated: “He will give strength [<i>oz</i>] to His people (Psalms 29:11), did Yitro not hear, come, and adhere to You?’ That is, “to You nations will come from the ends of the earth.”
Another matter, “Yitro…heard,” that is what is written: “The stranger does not stay the night outside” (Job 31:32). Just as it is written earlier in the portion [beginning]: “This is the statute of the paschal offering, [no foreigner shall eat from it]” (Exodus 12:43), until: A proselyte who married the daughter of an Israelite and begot a daughter, and the daughter went and married a legitimate priest and bore a son, that son is fit to be the High Priest.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash has referenced an earlier passage (<i>Shemot Rabba</i> 19:4), stated in conncection to Exodus 12:43. That passage cites the verse in Job and states that if a proselyte married the daughter of an Israelite, etc. </i> He stands and sacrifices atop the altar; the result is that the proselyte is inside and the Levite is on the outside. That is, “The stranger does not stay the night outside.” “I opened my doors for the guest” (Job 31:32), this is Yitro, for whom the Holy One blessed be He brought down manna, as it is stated: “He commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven” (Psalms 78:23).
Another matter, “Yitro…heard,” that is what is written: “Strike the cynic, and the naïf will become clever” (Proverbs 19:25). Likewise, it says: “With the punishment of a cynic, the naïf becomes wise” (Proverbs 21:11). Amalek and Yitro were consulted by Pharaoh. When Yitro saw that the Holy One blessed be He eliminated Amalek from this world and from the World to Come, he reconsidered and repented, as it is written above: “For I will expunge the memory of Amalek” (Exodus 17:14) and afterward: “Yitro heard.” He said: ‘I must go only to the God of Israel.’ From where do you derive that Amalek and the Midianites were enemies of Israel?<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that Midian was an enemy of Israel explains why Yitro, who was from Midian, advised Pharaoh to harm Israel. </i> As it is stated: The elders of Moav and the elders of Midian went” (Numbers 22:7). Likewise, “[Whenever Israel would sow,] the Midianites, Amalekites, and the people of the east [would come up against them. They would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the earth]” (Judges 6:3–4), and likewise, the wicked Bilam says: “He saw Amalek” (Numbers 24:20); that it did not change its ways. <br>But when he saw that Yitro had repented, what did he say? “He saw the Kenite” (Numbers 24:21); this is analogous to a hunter who would hunt birds. He trapped the first. He came to trap the second. It went and sat on the statue of the king. The hunter stood bewildered by it. He said to it: ‘If I throw a rock at you, I will be liable to be executed. If I extend the reed, I am afraid that it might touch the king’s statue. I do not know what to say to you; rather, you fled to a fine place and were spared.’ So too, Bilam saw Yitro and Amalek in counsel. He stood [and looked] at Amalek and eradicated its name.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Bilam said about Amalek: “…its end will be destruction” (Numbers 24:20). </i> He came to look at Yitro and found that he repented. He said to him: ‘You fled well.’ That is, “Mighty is your dwelling” (Numbers 24:21), like Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham is referred to as mighty; see, e.g., <i>Bava Batra</i> 15a based on Psalms 89:1. </i> That is, “strike the cynic,” this is Amalek; “and the naïf will become clever,” this is Yitro. <br>“Rebuke the discerning” (Proverbs 19:25), this is Moses, whom Yitro admonished when he saw him sitting and judging Israel all day. He said to him: “Why are you sitting alone?” (Exodus 18:14). “You will wear away” (Exodus 18:18). He said to him: ‘Do not do it because it is my opinion, but rather, consult with the Holy One blessed be He,’ as it is stated: “Heed my voice, I will counsel you [and may God be with you]” (Exodus 18:19). What is written thereafter? “Moses heeded his father-in-law, and he performed everything that he had said” (Exodus 18:24).
Another matter, “Yitro…heard,” that is what is written: “Cast your bread upon the water, for after many days you will find it” (Ecclesiastes 11:1). Are people imbeciles that they place their bread upon the water? Regarding whom is this stated? It is regarding Yitro, who gave his bread to Moses, as it is stated: “Call him and let him eat bread” (Exodus 2:20). That is, “cast your bread upon the water,” this is Moses, as it is stated: “Because I drew him from the water ” (Exodus 2:10). Why? “For after many days you will find it.” “Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread” (Exodus 18:12).
Another matter, “Yitro…heard.” He was called seven names:<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Yeter, Yitro, Ḥovav, Reuel, Ḥever, Putiel, Keini.</i> Yeter, when he was an idolater, as it is stated: “He returned to Yeter, his father-in-law” (Exodus 4:18). When he converted, a letter was added for him, just as it was for Abraham, and he was called Yitro. Alternatively, Yitro, because he added [<i>yiter</i>] one portion in the Torah, as it is stated: “You shall discern from all the people” (Exodus 18:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">He recommended establishing a judicial system.</i> Ḥovav, because he loved [<i>ḥibev</i>] the Torah, as it is written in the portion of: “Moses said to Ḥovav” (Numbers 10:29).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is cited to prove that Yitro was called Ḥovav (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i>
Another matter, “Yitro…heard,” that is what is written: “Heed the word of the Lord, house of Jacob” (Jeremiah 2:4). That is what the verse said: “My son, if you have become a guarantor for your friend” (Proverbs 6:1). Rabbi Neḥemya said: It is stated regarding Torah scholars. As long as a person is a Torah scholar, he is indifferent to the public and is not punished on their account. When a person is appointed as a leader and dons the cloak of leadership, he can no longer say: ‘I tend only to my own benefit; I do not care about the public.’ Rather, all the travail of the public is upon him. If he sees a person performing injustice to another, or performing a transgression, and he does not admonish him, he will be punished for it. The Divine Spirit screams: “My son, if you became a guarantor for your friend,” you are responsible for them. “If you have given your handshake for a stranger” (Proverbs 6:1); the Holy One blessed be He says to him: ‘You introduced yourself into the arena. One who introduces himself into the arena either prevails or is vanquished.’ The Holy One blessed be He says to him: ‘You and I are standing in the arena, either you prevail or I prevail.’<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The leader may be successful in averting Divine punishment from afflicting the community; if not, the Divine attribute of justice will prevail (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> <br>“You have been snared by the sayings of your mouth” (Proverbs 6:2). “Sayings” means nothing other than giving instruction regarding Torah, as it is stated: “My son, observe my sayings” (Proverbs 7:1), and likewise, “incline your ears to my sayings” (Proverbs 4:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, another danger of leadership is that one may issue incorrect rulings and be held accountable (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> “Do this, then, my son, and be delivered, as you have come into the hand of your friend” (Proverbs 6:3); apply yourself to know what to do, since you introduced yourself into this responsibility to become a leader. “Go, ingratiate yourself” (Proverbs 6:3) in the dust of the feet of princes who are greater than you. That is what is written: “And exalt [<i>urhav</i>] your friend” (Proverbs 6:3). <i>Rehav </i>means nothing other than royalty, as it is stated: “I mention Rahav” (Psalms 87:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash may understand this as a reference to the kingdom of Egypt. Some commentaries fail to see the relevance of this verse and suggest others that the midrash could have cited (see Maharzu). </i> If not, your blood is on your own head, like the blood of a gazelle and a deer. That is what is written: “Be delivered like a gazelle from the hand” (Proverbs 6:5) <as it is written in <i>Bereshit Rabba Parashat Vayigash</i> 93:1>. <br>The Rabbis say: “My son, if you have become a guarantor for your friend,” this is Israel, who are guarantors between themselves and the Holy One blessed be He.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This means that each member of Israel is responsible for the conduct of the others. </i> Israel is beloved as they are called friends, as it is stated: “For the sake of my brothers and friends” (Psalms 122:8). What was their guarantee? When the Holy One blessed be He came to give the Torah, none of the nations accepted it other than Israel. This is analogous to a king who had a field and he sought to entrust it to sharecroppers. He called the first and said to him: ‘Will you accept this field?’ He said to him: ‘I do not have the strength; it is too hard for me.’ Likewise, [he offered it] to a second, third, and fourth, but they did not accept it from him. He called the fifth and said to him: ‘Will you accept this field?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ ‘In order to work it?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ When he received it, he left it fallow. With whom would the king be angry, with those who said: ‘We are unable to accept it,’ or with the one who accepted it, but after he accepted it, he received it and left it fallow? Is it not with the one who accepted it? So too, when the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself on Mount Sinai, He did not leave any nation that He did not knock on their door, but they did not accept upon themselves to observe it. When He came to Israel, they said: “Everything that the Lord spoke we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). By right they should have heeded. That is, “heed the word of the Lord, house of Jacob” (Jeremiah 2:4). If not, you will be punished due to the guarantee. That is, “my son, if you have become a guarantor for your friend.” <br>Another matter, “heed the word of the Lord,” this is analogous to a king who said to his servants: ‘Guard these two goblets for me,’ and they were made of fine glass. He said to him: ‘Be careful with them.’ When [the servant] was entering the palace, there was a calf at the palace entrance. It butted the servant and one of them broke. The servant was standing and trembling before the king. He said to him: ‘Why are you trembling?’ He said: ‘Because a calf butted me and broke one of the two goblets.’ The king said to him: ‘If so, make certain to be careful with the second.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You crafted two goblets in Sinai, “we will perform and we will heed.” You violated “we shall perform,” as you made a calf before Me. Be careful with “we will heed.”’ That is, “heed the word of the Lord, house of Jacob.” <br>Another matter, “heed the word of the Lord.” That is what is written: “Heed and your soul will live (Isaiah 55:3). See how beloved is Israel, for He entices them. He said to them: ‘If a person falls from a rooftop, his entire body is hurt. The doctor enters to him and gives him a bandage on his head, as well as on his arms, on his legs, and on all his limbs. The result is that he is covered with bandages. I am not so. Rather, there are two hundred and forty-eight limbs in a person, and the ear is one of them. The entire body is contaminated with transgressions. When the ear heeds, the entire body is enlivened. “Heed, and your soul will live.”’ That is why it says: “Heed the word of the Lord, house of Jacob.” Likewise, you find that Yitro merited life by means of hearing. He heard and he converted, as it is stated: “Yitro, priest of Midian, father-in-law of Moses, heard everything that God had performed on behalf of Moses and Israel His people…” (Exodus 18:1).

Chapter 28

<b>“Moses ascended to God. The Lord called to him from the mountain, saying: So you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell to the children of Israel” (Exodus 19:3).</b> <br>“Moses ascended to God” – that is what is written: “You ascended on high; you took captives” (Psalms 68:19). What is “ascended”? You were exalted.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The term “ascended” is understood in the spiritual sense, but not that Moses physically ascended to heaven. </i> You struggled with angels on high.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Moses debated with the angels as to whether the Torah should be given to human beings (see <i>Shabbat</i> 88b). </i> <br>Another matter: “You ascended on high” – that there was no creature who prevailed on high like Moses prevailed. Rabbi Berekhya said: The length of the tablets was six handbreadths. As it were, there were two handbreadths in the hand of the One who spoke and the world came into being, two handbreadths in the hand of Moses, and two handbreadths separated between the two hands. <br>Another matter: “You ascended on high; you took captives” – the way of the world is that one who enters a province takes an item to which the residents of the province do not direct their attention, but Moses ascended on high and took the Torah, to which everyone directed their attention. That is, “you ascended on high; you took captives.” Is it, perhaps, that because he took it captive he took it for free?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Did Moses perhaps take it without effort or hardship?</i> The verse states: “You received gifts among men” (Psalms 68:19) – it was given to him as an acquisition.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The word for “you received [<i>lakaḥta</i>]” is often translated as, “you acquired.” The implication is that just as one must work to acquire something, Moses had to work hard to receive the Torah. </i> Was he, perhaps, obligated to give Him money? The verse states: “gifts”; it was given to him as a gift. <br>At that moment, the ministering angels sought to harm Moses. The Holy One blessed be He made the image of Moses’s face similar to Abraham. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Are you not ashamed before him? Is he not that one to whom you descended and ate in his house?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘The Torah was given to you due only to the merit of Abraham,’ as it is stated: “You received gifts among men [<i>adam</i>]” (Psalms 68:19). The <i>adam </i>stated here is no one other than Abraham, as it is stated: “The greatest man [<i>adam</i>] among the Anakim” (Joshua 14:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded as a reference to Abraham (<i>Soferim</i> 21:9).</i> That is, “Moses ascended to God.”
“The Lord called to him from the mountain, saying” – due to the merit of the mountain. The mountain is nothing other than the patriarchs, as it is stated: “Listen, mountains, to the Lord’s quarrel” (Micah 6:2). “Moses ascended to God” – he ascended in a cloud, and the merit of the patriarchs ascended and descended with him. <br>“So you shall say to the house of Jacob” – these are the women. He said to him: ‘Say to them the major principles, which they are capable of understanding.’ “And tell to the children of Israel” – these are the men. He said to him: ‘Say to them the fine points, which they are capable of understanding.’ <br>Another matter: Why to the women first? Because they have alacrity regarding mitzvot. Alternatively, so they will guide their children to Torah. <br>Rabbi Taḥlifa of Caesarea said: The Holy One blessed be He said: When I created the world, I commanded only Adam the first man, and thereafter Eve was commanded and she corrupted the world. Now, if I do not summon the women first, they will nullify the Torah. That is why it is stated: “So you shall say to the house of Jacob.” <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “So you shall say to the house of Jacob” – these are the Sanhedrin, as it is stated: “House of Jacob, come, let us walk by the light of the Lord” (Isaiah 2:5). <br><b>“God spoke all these matters, saying” (Exodus 20:1).</b> <br>“God spoke all these matters, saying” – the Holy One blessed be He conducted Himself vis-à-vis Israel with protocols of royalty, as it is stated: “With me, from Lebanon, my bride” (Song of Songs 4:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is not obvious how this verse pertains to the previous statement. See Rabbi David Luria; <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Why was it so? Due to the merit of their saying: “[All that the Lord has spoken] we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7).
“Moses reported the statement of the people to the Lord” (Exodus 19:8) – at that moment, the Holy One blessed be He sought to give them the Torah and to speak with them, but Moses was standing [on the mountain]. The Holy One blessed be He said: What shall I do about Moses? Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to a king who sought to issue a proclamation without the input of his chief official. He said to him: ‘Do such and such.’ He said to him: ‘It is already done.’ He then said to him: ‘Go and summon so-and-so the adviser and let him come with you.’ When he went, the king did what he sought to do. So too, the Holy One blessed be He sought to give the Ten Commandments. Moses was standing to His side. The Holy One blessed be He said: When I reveal the firmament to them and say: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), they will say: ‘Who spoke; was it the Holy One blessed be He or Moses?’ Rather, let Moses descend, and afterward I will say: “I am the Lord your God.” So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and they shall wash their garments” (Exodus 19:10). He said to Him: ‘I already sanctified them,’ as it is stated: “As you have warned us, saying: [Demarcate the mountain and sanctify it]” (Exodus 19:23). He said to him: “Go, descend, and you shall ascend and Aaron with you” (Exodus 19:24). When Moses descended, the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself, as it is stated: “Moses descended to the people” (Exodus 19:25), [and] immediately, “God spoke.”
“All these matters, saying” – He does everything concurrently. He kills and revives concurrently. He strikes and heals concurrently. A woman on the birthing stool, seafarers, travelers in the wilderness, those incarcerated in prison, one in the east, one in the west, one in the north, and one in the south, He hears them all concurrently. Likewise, it says: “I form light and create darkness” (Isaiah 45:7). Likewise, dust is transformed into a person and then transformed back into dust, as it is stated: “He transforms the shadow of death into morning” (Amos 5:8). What is “into morning”? As it was at the outset. What does it say at the outset? “All the water that was in the Nile was transformed into blood” (Exodus 7:20), then the blood was restored to water. Living flesh was transformed into dead, and the dead was restored to living.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This was when Moses’s hand turned leprous and then healed (Exodus 4:6–7).</i> The staff was transformed into a serpent, and the serpent was transformed back into a staff.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">See, e.g., Exodus 4:2–4. </i> The sea was transformed into dry land, and the dry land was then transformed into sea. Likewise it says: “He calls for the waters of the sea…” (Amos 5:8). <br>Likewise in speech, “Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it” (Exodus 20:8), and it says: “On the Shabbat day two lambs of the first year” (Numbers 28:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He commanded Shabbat observance and concurrently commanded the sacrifice of offerings, which requires acts otherwise prohibited on Shabbat. </i> Speech, “You shall not reveal the nakedness of your brother’s wife” (Leviticus 18:16); “when brothers dwell together” (Deuteronomy 25:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is the mitzva of levirate marriage with the widow of one’s childless brother. This mitzva constitutes an exception to the general prohibition to marry a woman who had been married to one’s brother.</i> All were said concurrently. That is, “God spoke all these matters, saying.”
Come and see that the attributes of the Holy One blessed be He are unlike the attributes of flesh and blood. A king of flesh and blood is unable to be a warrior and to be a Torah scholar and a schoolteacher. For the Holy One blessed be He it is not so. Yesterday, at the sea, like a warrior, as it is stated: “The Lord is a Man of war” (Exodus 15:3). And it says: “With His might, He calmed the sea” (Job 26:12). Today, at the giving of the Torah, He descended to teach Torah to His children, and likewise it says: “Behold, God is exalted in His power; who is a teacher like Him?” (Job 36:22). That is, “God spoke all these matters, saying.”
Another matter: “God spoke all these matters, saying” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What the prophets are destined to prophesy in each and every generation, they received at Mount Sinai, as Moses says to Israel: “Rather, with him who is here with us standing today [before the Lord our God], and with him who is not here with us today” (Deuteronomy 29:14). It is not written here, “standing with us today,” but rather, “with us today.” These are the souls [of people] who are destined to be created, which lack substance, in whose regard standing is not stated. Even though they were not there at that moment, each and every one received his due. <br>Likewise it says: “The prophecy of the word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi” (Malachi 1:1). It is not stated, “in the days of Malachi,” but rather, “through Malachi,” as the prophecy was with him since Mount Sinai, but he had not been given permission to prophesy until that time. Likewise, Isaiah said: “From the time that it was, I was there” (Isaiah 48:16). Isaiah said: From the day that the Torah was given at Sinai, I was there and I received this prophecy; however, “now the Lord God has sent me with His spirit” (Isaiah 48:16). Until then, permission had not been given to him to prophesy. <br>Not only did all the prophets receive their prophecy from Sinai, but all the Sages who arise in each and every generation, each and every one received their [wisdom] from Sinai. Likewise it says: “These words the Lord spoke to your entire assembly (Deuteronomy 5:19). <br>“A great voice that did not cease” (Deuteronomy 5:19) – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One voice that was divided into seven voices, and they were divided into seventy languages. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: From it, all the prophets who prophesied stood. The Rabbis say: It had no echo.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>yasaf</i> in the phrase “that did not cease [<i>yasaf</i>]” can be understood as related to the word continue [<i>hosif</i>] such that the verse would mean “that did not continue.” It would seem that the Rabbis interpret the verse in this manner (Maharzu). However, some commentaries dispute this assertion (see, e.g., <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said: What is: “The voice of the Lord is with might” (Psalms 29:4)? Is it possible to say so? Is it not so, that even an angel, there is no creature that can withstand its voice, as it is stated: “His body was like beryl…and the sound of his speech, like the noise of a multitude” (Daniel 10:6)? The Holy One blessed be He in whose regard it is written: “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth” (Jeremiah 23:24), does He need to speak mightily? Rather, “the voice of the Lord is with might [<i>bakoaḥ</i>],” with the might appropriate for each of the voices. In the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, this verse supports him, as it is stated: “My Lord gives the word, and the heralds are great armies” (Psalms 68:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that God’s voice is split into many voices, referred to as members of the great armies. </i>

Chapter 29

<b>“I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery” (Exodus 20:2).</b> <br>“I am the Lord your God” – that is what is written: “Has a people heard the voice of God [speaking [<i>medaber</i>] from the midst of the fire, as you heard, and lived?]” (Deuteronomy 4:33). The heretics asked Rabbi Simlai, they said to him: ‘Are there many gods in the world?’ He said to them: ‘Why?’ They said to him: ‘As, it is written: “Has a people heard the voice of God [<i>Elohim</i>]?”’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Elohim</i> is a plural term.</i> He said to them: ‘Does it say <i>medaberim</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is the plural term for speaking. The verse uses the singular <i>medaber</i>. </i> Rather, it says <i>medaber</i>.’ His disciples said to him: ‘Rabbi, you rebuffed them with a smashed reed;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Your response to them was unconvincing.</i> what do you respond to us?’ Rabbi Levi then interpreted it, he said to them: ‘“Has a people heard the voice of God” – how so? Had it been written: “The voice of the Lord is with His might,” the world would have been unable to survive. Rather, “the voice of the Lord is with might” (Psalms 29:4) – with the might of each and every individual, the lads in accordance with their might, the elders in accordance with their might, and children according to their might. The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: Do not believe that because you heard many voices, perhaps there are many gods in the heavens, but rather, know that I am the Lord your God, as it is stated: “I am the Lord your God”’ (Deuteronomy 5:6).
Another matter: “I am the Lord your God” – that is what is written: “Face to face the Lord spoke with you” (Deuteronomy 5:4). Rabbi Avdimi of Haifa said: Twenty-two thousand [angels] descended with the Holy One blessed be He to Sinai, as it is stated: “The chariots of God are myriads, thousands of angels [<i>shinan</i>]” (Psalms 68:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Since myriad in biblical and Talmudic usage means ten thousand, myriads indicates at least twenty thousand. Likewise, “thousands” indicates at least two thousand. Therefore, together there must be at least twenty-two thousand.</i> They were fine and praiseworthy. Is it, perhaps, that because they were many they were crowded? The verse states: <i>Shinan</i>, they were tranquil [<i>shaanan</i>] and serene. <br>“My Lord is in their midst” (Psalms 68:18) – it is not written with <i>yod</i>, but rather with <i>alef dalet</i>; the Lord of the entire world was in their midst.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse the name of God is not written as the Tetragrammaton, which begins with a <i>yod</i>, but is rather spelled <i>alef-dalet-nun-yod</i>, which is a word that literally means our master, or lord. This emphasizes God’s mastery over the world. </i> Alternatively, “my Lord is in their midst” – Rabbi Levi said: There was a tablet with the ineffable name inscribed over their hearts. <br>Another matter: “My Lord is in their midst” (Psalms 68:18) – the Rabbis say: The name of God<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">El</i> was intermingled with the name of each and every one [of the angels, e.g.], Mikhael and Gavriel. The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Do not think that because you saw many faces perhaps there are many gods in the heavens. Know that I am the one Lord, as it is stated: “I am the Lord your God.”’
Rabbi Toviya ben Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “I am the Lord your God”; for that reason I took you out of the land of Egypt, so that you will accept My divinity upon yourselves. Alternatively, “I am the Lord your God” – this is analogous to a princess who was taken captive by robbers, and the king came and rescued her. Some time later, he sought to take her as a wife. She said to him: ‘What will you give me?’ He said to her: ‘If all you receive from me is that I redeemed you from the robbers, it is sufficient.’
Another matter: “I am the Lord your God” – Rabbi Aḥa ben Rabbi Ḥanina began with this: “Hear, My people, and I will speak” (Psalms 50:7), <as is written in the Ten Commandments,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to a midrash on the Ten Commandments, which is unavailable. Some suggest that the reference should be to <i>Rut Rabba</i> 1:1, where the upcoming quote is cited. </i> until [the words]>: Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘I am the God over all of humanity, but I associated My name only with you. I am not called the God of idolaters, but rather, the God of Israel.’ <br>Rabbi Levi said: Israel requested two matters from before the Holy One blessed be He: That they would see His glory and hear His voice. They were seeing His glory and hearing His voice, as it is stated: “You said: Behold, the Lord our God has shown us His glory and His greatness” (Deuteronomy 5:21), and it is written: “And His voice we heard from the midst of the fire” (Deuteronomy 5:21), and they did not have the strength to withstand it. When they came to Sinai and He revealed Himself to them, their soul departed because He spoke with them, as it is stated: “My soul departed as He spoke” (Song of Songs 5:6). However, the Torah asked for mercy before the Holy One blessed be He on their behalf: ‘Is there a king who marries his daughter and kills the members of his household? The entire world is rejoicing and Your children are dying?’ Immediately, their souls were restored, as it is stated: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul” (Psalms 19:8). Rabbi Levi said: Was it not known before the Omnipresent that if He would show His glory to Israel and let them hear His voice, that they would be unable to withstand it? Rather, the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that they were destined to engage in idol worship. So they would not say: Had He shown us His glory and His greatness and let us hear His voice, we would not have engaged in idol worship, that is why it is stated: “Hear, My people, and I will speak.”
Another matter: “I am the Lord your God” – Rabbi Abbahu said: This is analogous to a king of flesh and blood who rules but who has a father or a brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">These relatives of the king are also given great honor. Additionally, if the king dies, he will be succeeded by another member of the royal family. </i> The Holy One blessed be He said: I am not so. “I am first” (Isaiah 44:6), as I have no father; “and I am last” (Isaiah 44:6), as I have no brother; “and besides Me there is no God” (Isaiah 44:6), as I have no son. <br>Another matter: “I am the Lord your God” – that is what is written: “I related, I saved, and I announced…” (Isaiah 43:12). “I related” to Egypt that you fled, so they would hear, pursue you, and drown in the sea, as it is stated: “It was told to the king of Egypt that the people had fled” (Exodus 14:5). “I saved” you, as it is stated: “The Lord saved Israel on that day” (Exodus 14:30). “And I announced” to the idolaters, as it is stated: “Peoples heard, they were agitated” (Exodus 15:14). “There was no stranger among you” (Isaiah 43:12) – as it is stated: “Moses sent his father-in-law away” (Exodus 18:27); immediately, “In the third month [from the exodus of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, on that day they came to the wilderness of Sinai]” (Exodus 19:1). “You are My witnesses, the utterance of the Lord, and I am God” (Isaiah 43:12).
“I am the Lord your God” – this is analogous to a king of flesh and blood who enters a city. They sweep it, sprinkle water on it, decorate it, spread fine curtains and tapestries, and kindle lamps. The Holy One blessed be He said: I am not so, but rather, when I entered My world, I spread tapestries, as it is stated: “Who spreads the heavens like a curtain” (Isaiah 40:22). I kindled lamps, as it is written: “God said: Let there be lights” (Genesis 1:14). I sprinkled water, as it is stated: “Let the waters be gathered” (Genesis 1:9). I decorated everything that I made, as it is stated: “The heavens and the earth and their entire host were completed” (Genesis 2:1).
“I am the Lord your God” – when a king of flesh and blood builds a palace, can he, perhaps, move it from its place? But I am not so, as it is stated: “I made and I will carry, I will bear and I will rescue” (Isaiah 46:4). “I made,” as it is stated: “The Lord God made for Adam and for his wife” (Genesis 3:21). “And I will carry,” as it is stated: “The Lord God took the man” (Genesis 2:15). <br>Another matter: “I made” (Isaiah 46:4) – “as I regret that I made them” (Genesis 6:7). “I will carry” (Isaiah 46:4) Noah, as it is stated: “The Lord shut him in” (Genesis 7:16). “I will bear” (Isaiah 46:4), as it is stated: “The Lord descended to see the city and the tower” (Genesis 11:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">God bore their sin, meaning that He did not destroy them as He had done to the generation of the Flood (Rabbi David Luria). </i> “And I will rescue” (Isaiah 46:4) Abraham, as it is stated: The Lord “said to him: I am the Lord who took you out of Ur of the Chaldeans” (Genesis 15:7). <br>Another matter: “I made” (Isaiah 46:4) Israel, as it is stated: “He made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). “I will carry” (Isaiah 46:4), as it is stated: “I carried you on the wings of eagles” (Exodus 19:4). “I will bear” (Isaiah 46:4) in the incident of the [Golden] Calf. “And I will rescue” (Isaiah 46:4), as it is stated: “The Lord said: I have forgiven in accordance with your word” (Numbers 14:20).
Another matter: when a king of flesh and blood goes out for a proclamation, he goes out alone. When he wages war, myriads upon myriads go out with him. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so, but rather when He goes out to war He goes out alone, as it is stated: “The Lord is a warrior” (Exodus 15:3). But when He went out to give the Torah at Sinai, myriads upon myriads went out with him, as it is stated: “The chariots of God are myriads, thousands of angels” (Psalms 68:18).
Another matter: “I am the Lord your God” – that is what is written: “A lion has roared; who will not fear?” (Amos 3:8). And that is what is written: “Who would not fear You, King of the nations? For it befits You” (Jeremiah 10:7). The prophets said to Jeremiah: ‘What did you see that led you to say “King of the nations”? All the prophets call Him King of Israel, and you call Him “King of the nations”?’ He said to them: ‘I heard from Him: “I appointed you a prophet for the nations” (Jeremiah 1:5). I said “King of the nations” to say: If He does not spare His children and the members of His household, will He spare others?’ As it is stated: “You are awesome from Your Sanctuary” (Psalms 68:36). “Who would not fear You, King of the nations?” Who will not fear You?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">After seeing what You have done to Israel, they will all fear You.</i> <br>This is analogous to a usurer who filled his purse with gold coins, and he was standing and shouting: Whoever wants should come and borrow. Everyone would hear and flee, saying: When he comes to collect his debt from the borrower, who can withstand him? So too, as it were, the Holy One blessed be He descended to Sinai to give the commandments so the world would not collapse, as it is stated: “The earth quaked, the heavens rained [before God, this is Sinai]” (Psalms 68:9), and likewise: “The mountains flowed before the Lord; [this is Sinai]” (Judges 5:8), and likewise: “The pillars of the heavens sag” (Job 26:11). And Israel was trembling, as it is stated: “and all the people [who were in the camp] trembled” (Exodus 19:16). And the mountain was trembling, as it is stated: “The entire mountain trembled greatly” (Exodus 19:18). Why was all this? It is only because He spoke commandments of life. The prophet shouts: “A lion has roared; who will not fear?” (Amos 3:8). Rabbi Yirmeya said: If at a time when He gives life to the world, “the earth quaked,” when He comes to exact retribution against the wicked who violated the words of the Torah, all the more so, as it is stated: “Who can stand before His fury” (Nahum 1:6), “Who can endure the day of His coming?” (Malachi 3:2). If when He is appeased no person can withstand His power, when He rises in His enflamed wrath, who will stand before Him? That is, “who would not fear You, King of the nations?” (Jeremiah 10:7). <br>Another matter: “A lion has roared” (Amos 3:8) – that is what is written: “They will follow the Lord; He will roar like a lion” (Hosea 11:10). Rabbi Simon said: This is analogous to a king who entered his palace; his queen heard, made room for him, and was trembling. If the queen is afraid, what will the maidservants and slaves do? So too, when the Holy One blessed be He revealed himself to give the Torah to Israel, they heard the sounds and died, as it is stated: “My soul departed as He spoke” (Song of Songs 5:6). If it is true for Israel, for the idolaters it is all the more so. <br>Another matter: “A lion has roared” (Amos 3:8) – the Rabbis say in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya: Baltza asked Rabbi Akiva, he said to him: ‘From where was the noise generated?’ [Rabbi Akiva] said to him: ‘When the Holy One blessed be He looks at the houses of idol worship and its worshippers, how they are situated in serenity and tranquility in the world, and He sees His Temple destroyed and given into the hands of idolaters, as it were, He is jealous and roars. Immediately, the heavens and the earth quake, as it is stated: “[The Lord] will roar from Zion, and from Jerusalem He will project His voice” (Joel 4:16). What does Israel do? As it were, He defends them, as it is stated: “But the Lord is shelter for His people” (Joel 4:16). <br>Another matter: “A lion has roared” (Amos 3:8) – come and see, the Temple is called lion [<i>arye</i>], as it is stated: “Oh Ariel, Ariel” (Isaiah 29:1). The royal house of David is called a lion, as it is stated: “[Take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel and say:] How your mother was a lioness; among lions she crouched” (Ezekiel 19:1-2). Israel is called a lion, as it is stated: “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9). Nebuchadnezzar is called a lion, as it is stated: “A lion rose from its thicket” (Jeremiah 4:7), and he destroyed the Temple, seized the kingship of the house of David, and exiled Israel. The Holy One blessed be He says: “Where is the lions’ den?” (Nahum 2:12). Where are My children? At that moment: “He will roar over His abode” (Jeremiah 25:30). <br>Another matter: “A lion has roared” (Amos 3:8) – the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Do you accept the Ten Commandments?’ They said to Him: ‘Yes,’ as it is stated: “With a ten-stringed lute [<i>alei asor</i>] and with harp” (Psalms 92:4). It is incumbent upon me [<i>alai</i>] to accept the Ten [<i>eser</i>] Commandments. What is “the Lord God has spoken; who will not prophesy” (Amos 3:8)? Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: When the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah, no bird tweeted, no fowl flew, no bull lowed, no wheels<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Divine Chariot</i> flew, seraphs did not say: “Holy, holy” (see Isaiah 6:3), the sea did not tremble, people did not speak, but rather, the entire world was quiet and silent. The voice emerged: “I am the Lord your God.” <br>Likewise it says: “These words the Lord spoke to your entire assembly…with a great voice, and it went on no more” (Deuteronomy 5:19) – Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: What is “and it went on no more”? When a person calls to another, his voice has an echo, but the voice that was emerging from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He did not have an echo. If you are astonished by this, Elijah, when he came to Carmel, he assembled all the priests and said to them: “Call in a great voice…as he is a god” (I Kings 18:27). What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He muted the entire world and silenced the heavenly and earthly beings. The world was emptiness and disorder as though there was no creature in the world, as it is stated: “There was no voice, no respondent, and no listener” (I Kings 18:29). Had anyone spoken, they would have said that Baal responded. All the more so, when the Holy One blessed be He spoke on Mount Sinai, He silenced the entire world, so that the creatures would know that there is no one other than He. He said: “I am the Lord your God.” Regarding the future it is written: “I, it is I who is your Comforter” (Isaiah 51:12).

Chapter 30

<b>“These are the ordinances that you shall place before them” (Exodus 21:1).</b> <br>“These are the ordinances [<i>hamishpatim</i>],” that is what is written: “The might of the King is that He loves justice [<i>mishpat</i>]” (Psalms 99:4). When is might ascribed to the Holy One blessed be He? When He executes judgment upon the idolaters. Thus you find regarding the wicked Nebuchadnezzar that because he boasted and said: “Is this not the great Babylon?” (Daniel 4:27), the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one, putrid discharge, you boasted and said: Due to the greatness of my might and in honor of my splendor. Do you not know that everything is Mine; greatness is Mine, might is Mine, honor is Mine, and splendor is Mine?’ Likewise, David said: “Yours, Lord, is the greatness, and the might, and the splendor, and the triumph, and the glory” (I Chronicles 29:11). And it says: “The Lord my God, You have become exceedingly great” (Psalms 104:1). The Holy One blessed be He said to Nebuchadnezzar: ‘The limited royalty that has been given you is from Me.’ Likewise Daniel said to him: ‘“To whom the God of the heavens has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory” (Daniel 2:37), and you said: Due to the greatness of my might and in honor of my splendor?’ That is, “the might of the King is that He loves justice.” The might belongs to the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He. He loves justice and He gave it to Israel who are His beloved. <br>That which is written: “You established equity [<i>meisharim</i>]” (Psalms 99:4); You established uprightness [<i>yashrut</i>] for Your beloved as, by means of the ordinances that You gave them, when they enter into disputes with one another they come to judgment and make peace. <br>Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, until when will You refrain from executing justice upon the idolaters?’ He said to them: ‘Until their time will arrive to be harvested,’ as it is stated: “On that day, sing about it: a vineyard of wine” (Isaiah 27:2). Does a person pick his vineyard before it ripens? Rather, after it ripens, he picks it, places it into the wine press, stomps it, and sings, and [his fellows] answer after him. Thus the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Wait for Me until the time of Edom will arrive, and I will stomp it, as it is stated: “I will cast my shoe at Edom” (Psalms 60:10). I will open for you and you will answer after Me.’ That is why it is stated: “Sing about it: a vineyard of wine.” <br>‘“I, the Lord, guard it; every moment I water it” (Isaiah 27:3). It is I who guards it in order to give it many [bitter] cups to drink, as it is stated: “Every moment I water it.” If I come to look at them, I will eliminate them from the world. However, “I have no fury” (Isaiah 27:4), like they become filled with fury against My children. Rather, what do I do to them? “I would trample and ignite them together” (Isaiah 27:4).’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God is saying: Although Edom immediately acts with fury against My children, I do not do so against them. I wait for them, until their measure of sin is full, but then I will trample them and set them on fire.</i> <br>Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He said to the idolaters: ‘Israel is Mine,’ as it is stated: “For the children of Israel are servants to Me” (Leviticus 25:55). ‘Fury is Mine,’ as it is stated: “The Lord is vengeful and filled with fury” (Nahum 1:2). ‘You become filled with what is Mine,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Fury.</i> against what is Mine,’ as it is stated: “If only I were given thorns and thistles in war” (Isaiah 27:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is not cited as proof of the preceding statement but as a consequence; God says that He will, eventually, light the idolaters on fire like thorns and thistles. </i> <br>The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘If I alter [<i>meshaneh</i>] My attribute of justice,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If I stop having patience with sinners.</i> I will eliminate them with one lightning bolt [<i>barak</i>], as it is stated: “If I hone [<i>shanoti</i>] My flashing [<i>berak</i>] sword” (Deuteronomy 32:41). But what do I do? “My hand will grasp judgment”’ (Deuteronomy 32:41).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God says: I will continue My general course of judgment, which involves delaying judgment for sinners. </i> Likewise it says: “He will grasp My stronghold [<i>bema’uzi</i>]” (Isaiah 27:5). <i>Ma’uzi </i>means nothing other than justice, as it is stated: “The might [<i>oz</i>] of the King is that He loves justice” (Psalms 99:4). The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Just as I could violate justice for the idolaters, but I do not violate it, but rather grasp justice, so you shall not go outside the bounds of justice, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances [<i>mishpatim</i>].”
What is written prior to the matter: “You shall not ascend on stairs to My altar, [so that your nakedness will not be exposed upon it]” (Exodus 20:23). And it is written: “And these are the ordinances.”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">These verses appear consecutively in the Torah, although the division of the text into chapters separates them into separate chapters. </i> What does this matter have in common with that? Was the nakedness of the priests exposed? But is it not written: “Make for them linen trousers to cover the flesh of their nakedness”? (Exodus 28:42). Rather, Rabbi Avina said: Just as the Holy One blessed be He cautioned the priest to refrain from taking large steps atop the altar; rather, they should walk with measured steps,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The text here reads literally “heel next to toe.”</i> so, the Holy One blessed be He cautioned the judges that they should not take large steps in judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They should skip no steps and make no unfounded assumptions in reaching their judgment.</i>
Another matter, “these are [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the ordinances,” Rabbi Abahu said: Every place where <i>ve’eleh</i> is written, it adds to the previous matter, and every place that <i>eleh </i>is written it rejects the previous matter. How so? “This is [<i>eleh</i>] the legacy of the heavens and the earth on the day that they were created” (Genesis 2:4). What did it reject? He had been creating heavens and earth and examining them. They were not pleasing to Him, and He would restore them to emptiness and disorder. When He saw this heavens and earth, they were pleasing to Him. He said: “This is the legacy of the heavens and the earth,” but what came before was not a legacy. <br>Similarly, “this is [<i>eleh</i>] the legacy of Noah” (Genesis 6:9). What did it reject? It rejected the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and Keinan and his counterparts. Therefore it says: “The sons of Yefet, Gomer and Magog” (Genesis 10:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah enters into great detail when enumerating the descendants of Noah, but not with the preceding generations.</i> <br>Similarly, “this is [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:12), adds to the previous matter. Who are they? What is written beforehand, as it is stated: “She bore him<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ketura bore for Abraham.</i> Zimran and Yokshan” (Genesis 25:2). Here, too, “this is [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham…the firstborn of Ishmael is Nevayot” (Genesis 25:12–13). They were wicked like them.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The sons of Ishmael were wicked like the sons of Ketura. </i> <br>Similarly, “this is [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the legacy [<i>toledot</i>] of Isaac son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:19) adds to the previous matter, to what was written beforehand: “The sons of Ishmael” (Genesis 25:16). Who was it? It was Esau and his sons, for he was a son of Isaac. If so, it may be said that since only “this is [<i>ve’eleh</i>]<i> </i>the legacy” is written, Jacob, too, who was part of the legacy of Isaac, is included with Esau? You find that every [time the word] <i>toledot </i>appears in the Bible it is written defectively,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">It is written without a <i>vav </i>between the <i>tav</i> and <i>lamed </i>or without a <i>vav</i> between the<i> dalet</i> <i> and the tav</i>.</i> except for: “This is the legacy [<i>toledot</i>] of the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 2:4), and “this is the legacy [<i>toledot</i>] of Peretz” (Ruth 4:18). And there is a compelling reason why it says: “This is the legacy [<i>toledot</i>] of the heavens and the earth” in full. It is because the Holy One blessed be He created His world and there was no angel of death in the world. That is why it is complete. When Adam and Eve sinned, the Holy One blessed be He minimized all the <i>toledot </i>in the Bible. When Peretz arose, his <i>toledot </i>became full, because the Messiah will emerge from him, in whose days the Holy One blessed be He will eliminate death, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). That is the reason that <i>toledot</i> of the heavens and earth and <i>toledot</i> of Peretz are full. This is the reason that <i>toledot</i> of Isaac is defective, to exclude Jacob from the category of the wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The Messiah can also be traced back to Jacob, and therefore the word <i>toledot</i> should have been written regarding Isaac with the <i>vav</i>. It is written without the <i>vav</i> as an indication that it is referring only to Esau and not to Jacob. </i> <br>Similarly, “this is [<i>eleh</i>] the legacy of Jacob” (Genesis 37:2), it rejected the chieftains of Esau. <br>Similarly, “these are [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the names of the children of Israel” (Exodus 1:1), adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: The children of Reuben and the children of Simeon.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to the listing of the descendants of Jacob who came down to Egypt (see Genesis 46:8–27). </i> <br>Similarly, “this is [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the legacy of Aaron” (Numbers 3:1) adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: “These are the counted, that Moses and Aaron…counted” (Numbers 1:44). Just like those beforehand were righteous, so, too, these were righteous.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Although the verses regarding Aaron proceed to list Nadav and Avihu, who were killed due to the offering of a strange fire before God (see Numbers 3:2–4), on the whole they were still considered righteous. </i> <br>Here, too, “these are [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the ordinances” adds to the previous matter, that which was written beforehand: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances” (Exodus 15:25). <br>Another matter, “these are [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the ordinances.” What is written before this portion? “They shall judge the people at all times” (Exodus 18:22). And it says here: “These are the ordinances,” and the [Ten] Commandments are in the middle. This is analogous to a noblewoman who was walking, an armed guard on this side and an armed guard on that side, and she was in the middle. So, too, the [giving of the] Torah had justice before it and justice after it and it was in the middle. Likewise it says: “I walk on the path of righteousness” (Proverbs 8:20). The Torah says: In which path do I walk? I will walk in the path of those who perform righteousness. “In the midst of the paths of justice” (Proverbs 8:20), the Torah in the middle and justice before it and after it; before it, as it is stated: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances,” justice after it, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances.”
Another matter, “these are [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the ordinances.” There were three matters to which Moses devoted his life, and they are called by his name. These are: Israel, the Torah, and the laws. Israel, how much he suffered on their account, and they were called by his name, as it is stated: “He remembered the days of old, Moses, his people” (Isaiah 63:11). Torah, as it is stated: “Remember the Torah of Moses My servant” (Malachi 3:22). The laws, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances that you shall place before them.” Likewise, Esther devoted her life on behalf of Israel and they were called by her name, as it is stated: “To plead with him on behalf of her people” (Esther 4:8).
Come and see how excellent this portion is. How many sections are in it, and how many prohibitions the Holy One blessed be He cautioned Israel in this portion: “If you purchase a Hebrew slave” (Exodus 21:2); “if a man sells his daughter as a maidservant” (Exodus 21:7); “one who strikes his father” (Exodus 21:15). <br>What does this matter have in common with that? The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘I acquired you in Egypt with the ten plagues that I displayed, as it is stated: “Wondrous are Your works; I know this well” (Psalms 139:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The previous verse in Psalms states: “For you have formed [<i>kanita</i>] my innermost parts.” The word <i>kanita</i> can also be translated “you have acquired.” Thus, the midrash is interpreting these two verses to mean that God has acquired us through His wondrous works, i.e. the ten plagues, which are referred to as wonders (see Exodus 3:20). </i> Just as you are commanded not to enslave your brother more than six years,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the text should read: Just as you are commanded to work six days and rest on the seventh (<i>Yefe Toar</i>).</i> as I created the world in only six days; therefore, I granted you six years that you are permitted to enslave a Hebrew slave. “If a man sells his daughter as a maidservant,” I had one daughter<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah.</i> and I sold her to you so that you do not take her out, but rather she is stored in the Ark. “She shall not be released like the release of the slaves” (Exodus 21:7). Treat her with respect, as you took her captive from Me, as it is stated: “You ascended on high; You took captives”’ (Psalms 68:19). Likewise, David praises: “Halleluya, for it is good to sing to our God, for it is pleasant” (Psalms 147:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The penultimate verse of the psalm states: “He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances to Israel” (Psalms 147:19). The midrash thus asserts that the reason it is good to sing to God is because of the laws of the Torah.</i> <br>Rabbi Shmuel says: The Holy One blessed be He cautioned them regarding lenient matters with stringent matters, as there are many prohibitions here. For example, “one who strikes his father or his mother [shall be put to death]” (Exodus 21:15). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Ham, father of Canaan did not strike, but merely saw, and now he and his descendants are slaves forever,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ham saw the nakedness of his father, Noah, and as a result was cursed with everlasting servitude (see Genesis 9:22–25). </i> one who curses or strikes all the more so.’ Who were they?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Which Israelites are compared to people who were guilty of improperly treating their father, i.e. God. </i> These were the Ten Tribes, who did not want to place upon themselves the yoke of the Holy One blessed be He, and Sennacheribcame upon them and exiled them. This is analogous to a king who had ten sons and they rebelled against him, and they annulled ten of his royal edicts. He said to them: ‘Just as you annulled what is mine, so I will send a fly and exact retribution from you.’ So too, the Ten Tribes rebelled against the Holy One blessed be He and nullified the Torah, as it is stated: “They denied the Lord, and they said: It is not Him” (Jeremiah 5:12). He brought the fly upon them, as it is stated: “The Lord will whistle for the fly” (Isaiah 7:18), this is Sennacherib. If Israel nullified the mitzvot it is as though they are cursing their father and mother. Father is no one other than the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Now, Lord, You are our Father” (Isaiah 64:7). Mother is the Torah, as it is stated: “Do not forsake the Torah of your mother” (Proverbs 1:8). And she raises you at Sinai, as it is stated: “I have instructed you [<i>horeitikha</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Horeitikha</i> is expounded as an allusion to pregnancy [<i>herayon</i>]; the Torah is its mother.</i> in the way of wisdom” (Proverbs 4:11).
<b>“If men fight and they strike a pregnant woman and her children are miscarried, but there is no fatality, he shall be fined; as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him, he shall give in court” (Exodus 21:22). <br>“But if there will be a fatality, you shall give a life for a life” (Exodus 21:23).</b> <br>Come and see how much the Holy One blessed be He commanded in this portion regarding each and every matter, as it is stated: “If men fight and they strike a pregnant woman” (Exodus 21:22). If she dies, “you shall give a life for a life” (Exodus 21:23), but if she does not die, he is punished with a monetary payment. Until this point, he has not seen the light, but rather, is in his mother’s womb, as the Torah cautions Israel regarding each and every matter.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">If the woman miscarries, since the fetus had not been born there is no death penalty for the attacker, but nonetheless the Torah provides a punishment. </i> This is analogous to a prince whose father cautioned him not to collide with anything and get injured, as he is so dear to him, the apple of his eye. So too, the Holy One blessed be He cautioned Israel regarding the mitzvot. Why? Because they are more dear to Him than the angels, as it is stated: “You are children to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1). Likewise, David said: “Lord our God, You answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, but You took vengeance for their misdeeds [<i>alilotam</i>]” (Psalms 99:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Because You elevated them due to Your love for them, you punish them even for harming fetuses [<i>olalim</i>] in their mothers’ wombs.</i>
<b>“If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five cattle for the ox and four sheep for the sheep” (Exodus 21:37).</b> <br>Rabbi Yehuda says: Israel said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘There are many laws of mitzvot here. “If a man steals an ox,” because we stole an ox and crafted a calf,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash asserts that when God revealed Himself on Sinai He descended in the heavenly chariot, which is drawn by four creatures, one of which resembles an ox. The Israelites fashioned the golden calf after this form on the divine chariot (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 3:2; 48:6). Thus, the sin of the golden calf is compared to theft, as though they stole the ox from the heavenly chariot (<i>Yefe To’ar</i>). </i> therefore, we paid fivefold for it, as our fathers died in the wilderness because of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Although the punishment was administered for the sin of the spies, it included punishment for the sin of the golden calf as well.</i> “And four sheep for the sheep,” the four kingdoms that have ruled over us.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, Israel paid fourfold and fivefold for the sin of the golden calf. </i> And for abducting Joseph, we spent four hundred years enslaved in Egypt.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Joseph is referred to as a flock (see Psalms 80:2). The four hundred years are considered as having paid fourfold for his abduction. </i> <br>Why for the ox does one give fivefold, and for the sheep he gives only fourfold? For the ox he gives fivefold because he takes it out in public. This is analogous to two who went up to the podium for judgment, one who sold the son of a prince and one who cast a stone at a statue of the prince. The one who cast the stone at the statue of the prince received five harsh lashes, and the one who sold the son of the prince paid four hundred to his master.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Although the one who abducted and sold the prince committed an act that was inherently more severe, the individual who threw the stone received the harsher punishment. This was because his act was performed in public and therefore constituted a greater denigration to the honor of the prince. </i> That is why it is written: “Five cattle” (Exodus 21:37). David said: “Do not enter into judgment with Your servant” (Psalms 143:2).
<b>“You shall not afflict any widow or orphan” (Exodus 22:21).</b> <br> “You shall not afflict any widow or orphan.” Rabbi Yosei says: Why does God love orphans and widows? It is because their eyes are directed exclusively to Him, as it is stated: “Father of orphans, Judge of widows” (Psalms 68:6). Therefore, anyone who robs them, robs the Holy One blessed be He, as He is their Father in Heaven, and He becomes angry with him, as it is stated: “My wrath will be enflamed and I will kill you” (Exodus 22:23). This is analogous to the daughter of kings who sinned against her father and he banished her.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is based on an emendation to the Hebrew text accepted by many commentaries (see <i>Yefe To’ar</i>; Rabbi David Luria; Maharzu). </i> She had children and she cast them upon him and left. When [the king] would see them, it was as though he would see his daughter before him. If anyone would touch them, [the king] would exact retribution against him. So too, Israel was in Zion and the Holy One blessed be He was resting in their midst, as it is stated: “This is My resting place forever” (Psalms 132:14). When they sinned, He banished them, and they cast their children upon Him, as it is stated: “We have become orphans, with no father; our mothers are like widows” (Lamentations 5:3). When He sees Israel performing mitzvot, He regrets what He did in Zion and seeks merit for it, as it is stated: “I have returned to Zion, I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem” (Zechariah 8:3). Likewise David said: “Return, Lord, our captives” (Psalms 126:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded to mean that the Lord should return His presence to Zion while He is returning the Jewish captives.</i>
Another matter, “these are the ordinances” (Exodus 21:1), that is what is written: “He declares His words to Jacob” (Psalms 147:19); these are the commandments, “His statutes and ordinances to Israel” (Psalms 147:19); these are the ordinances. Because the attributes of the Holy One blessed be He are unlike the attributes of flesh and blood. The attribute of flesh and blood is that he instructs others to perform, but he does not perform anything. The Holy One blessed be He is not so. What He performs, He says to Israel to perform and to observe. There was an incident involving Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, and Rabbi Akiva, who went to Rome and expounded: ‘The ways of the Holy One blessed be He are unlike flesh and blood, as they issue an edict and say to others to perform, but the Holy One blessed be He is not so.’ There was a particular heretic there. After [the audience] departed, he said to [the rabbis]: ‘Your words are nothing but falsehood. Did you not say that God says and performs? Why does He not observe Shabbat?’<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">God brings rain, makes the wind blow, the heavenly bodies pass through the sky, and all of these violate the prohibition of carrying from one domain to another or within a public domain on Shabbat (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> They said to him: ‘Wicked one of the world, is a person not permitted to carry within his courtyard on Shabbat?’ He said to them: ‘Yes.’ They said to him: ‘The upper and lower realms are the courtyard of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The entire world is filled with His glory” (Isaiah 6:3). And is it not so that even if a person is in a [location where it is] forbidden [to carry]<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The public domain. </i> he may carry a distance equivalent to his height?’<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">One may carry an object in the public domain a distance less than four cubits. </i> He said to them: ‘Yes.’ They said to him: ‘It is written: “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?”’ (Jeremiah 23:24). <br>Another matter, “He declares His words to Jacob” (Psalms 147:19); Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina: This is analogous to a king who had an orchard and he would plant in it all kinds of trees. Only he would enter it, as he guarded it. When his sons came of age, he said to them: ‘My sons, I have been guarding this orchard and I have not allowed any person to enter into it. You shall guard it in the manner that I have guarded it.’ So too, God said to Israel: ‘Before I created this world, I established the Torah,’ as it is stated: “I was with Him as a nursling [<i>amon</i>]” (Proverbs 8:30). What is <i>amon</i>? It is a nurse [<i>omen</i>], as it is stated: “As a nurse [<i>omen</i>] carries a nursing child” (Numbers 11:12). ‘I did not give it to any of the idolaters, but only to Israel,’ as once Israel stood and said: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), He immediately gave them [the Torah]. That is, “He declares His words to Jacob, His statutes and ordinances to Israel. He did not do so with any other nation” (Psalms 147:19–20), but to whom? To Jacob, whom He chose over all the idolaters. He gave [the other nations] only a few [commandments]. He gave Adam six mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The six were: The prohibition of idol worship; the prohibition of murder; the prohibition of incest and adultery; the prohibition of robbery and kidnapping; the prohibition of blasphemy; the obligation to establish courts of law.</i> He added one for Noah;<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">He added the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal.</i> for Abraham, eight,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">He added the mitzva of circumcision.</i> for Jacob, nine.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">He added the prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve of an animal.</i> But to Israel, He gave them everything. <br>Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: This is analogous to a king who had a table set before him with types of cooked dishes. His servant entered and he gave him a piece. The second, he gave him an egg. The third, he gave him a vegetable, and likewise to each and every one. When his son entered, he gave him the entire table that was before him. He said to him: ‘To each of them I gave one portion, but I have placed everything in your possession.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He gave to the idolaters only a few mitzvot. But when Israel arose, He said to them: ‘The whole Torah in its entirety is for you,’ as it is stated: “He did not do so with any other nation.” <br>Rabbi Elazar said: This is analogous to a king who went out to war and his legions were with him. He would slaughter an animal and would distribute to each and every one of them a portion, for him to toil in its preparation. His son looked and said to him: ‘What are you giving me?’ He said to him: ‘From what I prepared for myself.’ Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He gave the idolaters crude mitzvot,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">These mitzvot were given to the nations but their details were not defined; that was left for the nations to figure out. Alternatively, He gave them rudimentary mitzvot only. </i> in which they would toil.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">They would need to toil to define them.</i> He did not distinguish for them between ritual impurity and purity. Israel came and He explained each and every one of the mitzvot<i> </i>to them, its punishment and its reward, as it is stated: “May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth” (Song of Songs 1:2). That is why it says: “His statutes and His ordinances to Israel.”
Another matter, “these are [<i>ve’eleh</i>] [the ordinances],” what is <i>ve’eleh</i>? Come and see how much the Holy One blessed be He loved Moses. When Datan and Aviram demeaned him in Egypt, as they said to him: “Who appointed you to be a leader and a judge over us?” (Exodus 2:14), the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘With what you demeaned him, I will grant him greatness,’ as it is stated: “These are [<i>ve’eleh</i>]<i> </i>the ordinances.”<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash asserts that it was Datan and Aviram who demeaned Moses by saying: “Who appointed you [<i>samkha</i>] to be a leader and a judge [<i>shofet</i>] over us?” Moses received greatness in that he was the one to whom the verse: “These are the ordinances that you shall place [<i>tasim</i>] before them” was said. This is implied by the term <i>ve’eleh</i>, because the <i>vav</i> at the beginning of the word implies a connection to what had occurred earlier (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 30:3), and by the use of the term “place” [<i>tasim</i>], which is from the same root as “appointed you” [<i>samkha</i>]. </i> <br>Another matter, “these are the ordinances,” Moses heard Yitro say: “You shall identify from all the people [capable men, fearers of God, men of truth, haters of ill-gotten gain]” (Exodus 18:21). He said to him four attributes, but he found only one, as it is stated: “Moses selected capable men” (Exodus 18:25) and he appointed them judges over Israel. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I gave you [the duty of] judgment and you appointed others who do not know;<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">They do not know the laws and do not have all the necessary qualities to be ideal judges. </i> you go and teach them.’ As it is stated: “These are the ordinances [that you shall place before them].”
Another matter, “these are [<i>ve’eleh</i>] the ordinances.” “It was on the third day when it was morning” (Exodus 19:16), in the morning the Torah was given, and in the evening the ordinances were given.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>vav</i> at the beginning of <i>ve’eleh</i> links the ordinances in the upcoming passage to the previous portion, in which the Torah was given. The midrash understands this to mean that they were given on the same day. </i> That is what is written: “From morning to evening they are broken; [forever unaware, they perish]” (Job 4:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The wicked are punished due to their having ignored the Torah, which was given in the morning, and the ordinances, which were given in the evening. </i> This is analogous to two men who went to court,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is based on <i>Etz Yosef</i>; see also <i>Matnot Kehuna</i>. </i> one was a professional [lawyer] and one was a layman. What caused the layman to be punished? It is that he had no one to teach him. So too, the Holy One blessed be He was standing on Mount Sinai and was holding back judgment, as it is stated: “My hand grasps judgment” (Deuteronomy 32:41). David said: “Judge me, Lord, in accordance with my righteousness” (Psalms 7:9). He checked, but he did not find anyone to teach him,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">He believed that he was righteous because there was no one to teach him the parameters of the divine attribute of justice.</i> and he was punished. He began shouting: “Do not enter into judgment with Your servant” (Psalms 143:2). When was all this? It was before he organized the ordinances for himself, to realize what is stated: “From morning to evening they are broken; [forever unaware [<i>mesim</i>], they perish]” (Job 4:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>mesim</i> is taken as an allusion to the ordinances, of which it is stated: “These are the ordinances that you shall place [<i>tasim</i>] before them.” Thus, the punishment is due to an insufficient knowledge of the ordinances, and of the extent to which an individual is held accountable in the Divine process of judgment. </i> <br>Another matter, “these are the ordinances.” What is: “Forever unaware, they perish”? (Job 4:20). Job said to the Holy One blessed be He: “If only I could know and find Him…I would organize my case before Him” (Job 23:3–4). This is analogous to a ruffian who was intoxicated. He kicked the prison [door] and freed the prisoners. He stoned the statue of the governor of the city, cursed a policeman, and said: ‘Show me the place where the governor of the city is located and I will teach him justice.’ He entered; they showed him the mayor of the city sitting on the podium. [The governor] incarcerated a noblewoman and expelled a city official, blinded a duke, sentenced a judge, and placed a magistrate in stocks. When [the ruffian] saw the governor of the city doing so, he was afraid. He said: ‘I implore you, I was intoxicated and was unaware of the power of the governor of the city.’ <br>So too, Job was standing and screaming: “If only I could know and find Him…I would organize my case before Him.” He stoned the image, as he said: “Perish the day I was born” (Job 3:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Man is created in the image of God.

[The King] incarcerated the noblewoman: “Behold, Miriam is leprous as snow” (Numbers 12:10). He expelled Moses: “Therefore, you will not bring this congregation [into the land which I have given them]” (Numbers 20:12). He blinded the duke, this is Isaac, as it is stated: “His eyes were dimmed from seeing” (Genesis 27:1). He sentenced Abraham, as it is stated: “Know that your descendants will be strangers” (Genesis 15:13). He placed Jacob in stocks: “He was limping on his thigh” (Genesis 32:32). When Job saw, he said: ‘I implore You, I was intoxicated,’ as it is stated: “Indeed I erred, my error rests with me’ (Job 19:4). Why to that extent?

Another matter, “these are the ordinances,” that is what is written: “He declares His words to Jacob” (Psalms 147:19). One time, Aquila said to the emperor Hadrian: ‘I wish to convert and to become a Jew.’ He said to him: ‘That nation you wish [to join]? How much have I demeaned it, how much of its [people] have I killed! You wish to intermingle with the lowliest of nations. What did you see in them that you wish to convert?’ He said to him: ‘The least among them knows how the Holy One blessed be He created the world, what was created on the first day and what was created on the second day. How long it has been since the world was created and upon what does the world stand. And, their Torah is truth.’ He said to him: ‘Go study their Torah, but do not circumcise yourself.’ Aquila said to him: ‘Even the wisest man in your kingdom or a one-hundred-year-old elder is unable to study their Torah if he is not circumcised,’ as it is written: “He declares His words to Jacob, His statutes and ordinances to Israel. He did not do so with any other nation” (Psalms 147:19–20). But with whom? With the children of Israel.
Another matter, “these are the ordinances,” that is what is written: “A king upholds the land with justice” (Proverbs 29:4), this is the Holy One blessed be He, who created His world with justice, as it is stated: “In the beginning, God created” (Genesis 1:1). “The Lord created” is not stated, but rather “God created.” It does not say: ‘The Lord said: Let there be a firmament,’ but rather, “God” (Genesis 1:6). The same is true of all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">In each stage of creation, the verses refer to “God” rather than “the Lord.” According to the midrash, verses employ the name “God” when He acts with the attribute of justice, and “the Lord” when He acts with the attribute of mercy (see, e.g., <i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 12:16). </i> Likewise, David said: “For God is Judge” (Psalms 50:6), to teach you that the world was created with justice. <br>“But a man of donations [<i>terumot</i>] will destroy it” (Proverbs 29:4); this is Adam. Just as it is the way of a woman when she seeks to separate her <i>ḥalla</i>, she kneads the flour and then takes <i>ḥalla</i>, so God did. He kneaded the world and then took Adam, as it is stated: “Mist would ascend from the earth” (Genesis 2:6), and then: “[The Lord God] formed [man of the dust of the ground]” (Genesis 2:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The comparison here is based on the fact that <i>ḥalla</i> is also referred to as <i>teruma</i>; see Numbers 15:20).</i> When he sinned, God said to him: “The land is cursed because of you” (Genesis 3:17). That is why it is stated: “But a man of donations [will destroy it].” <br>Another matter, “a king upholds the land with justice,” this is Yehoshafat, as it is stated: “Yehoshafat said to the judges: Consider what you are doing” (II Chronicles 19:6). “But a man of donations will destroy it,” this is a Sage who knows <i>halakhot</i>, midrash, and <i>agadot</i>, and an orphan and a widow go to him so that he will implement justice for them, and he says to them: ‘I am preoccupied with my studies, I am not available.’ God says to him: ‘I consider it as though you destroyed the world.’ That is why it says: “But a man of donations [<i>terumot</i>] will destroy it.”<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Such a Sage is referred to as a man of <i>terumot</i> because he is involved in endeavors that are sacred, just as <i>teruma</i> is sacred, and he removes [<i>merim</i>] himself from involvement in justice. </i> <br>Another matter, “a king upholds the land with justice,” this is Israel, as it is stated: “You shall be for Me a kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6). “But a man of donations [<i>terumot</i>] will destroy it,” this is the generation of the flood, which did not implement justice.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">They separated [<i>herimu</i>] themselves from justice. </i> See what is written in their regard: “They drive the donkey of orphans…. They turn the indigent from the way” (Job 24:3–4). Rabbi Aḥa said: The Holy One blessed be He sought to give them four matters: Torah, suffering, the rite of offerings, and prayer, but they did not seek it, as it is stated: “They say to God: Turn away from us” (Job 21:14), this is the suffering. “We do not desire the knowledge of Your ways” (Job 21:14), this is Torah. “What is the Almighty that we should worship Him?” (Job 21:15), these are the offerings. “What good will it do if we encounter Him?” (Job 21:15), this is prayer. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘What caused you to be eliminated from the evening of this world and from the morning of the World to Come?<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">This world is compared to evening or night, and the World to Come is compared to morning. </i> It is because you did not accept the Torah in which there is justice,’ as it is stated: “From morning to evening they are broken” (Job 4:20). Why? “Forever unaware [<i>mesim</i>], they perish” (Job 4:20), and <i>mesim </i>is nothing other than justice, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances that you shall place [<i>tasim</i>] before them.”
Another matter, “these are the ordinances.” David said: “Fear of the Lord is pure, it endures forever” (Psalms 19:10). How is this so? You find that a person may study midrash, <i>halakhot</i>, and <i>agadot</i>, but if he does not have fear of sin, he has nothing. This is analogous to a person who says to another: ‘I have one thousand measures of grain and one thousand of wine.’ The other said to him: ‘Do you have storehouses in which to place them? If you have that, you have everything. If not, you have nothing.’ So it is with a person who studies everything. It is said to him: ‘If you have fear of sin, you have everything,’ as it is stated: “The faithfulness of your times [will be the strength of salvation, wisdom and knowledge]; fear of the Lord, that is His treasure” (Isaiah 33:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">There is an allusion to the six orders of the Mishna in the first part of the verse (see <i>Shabbat </i>31a), but it concludes with the fear of God characterized as His treasure. The word used here for treasure [<i>otzar</i>] may also be translated as storehouse. </i> That is why it is stated: “Fear of the Lord is pure.” And the prophet screams: “Zion will be redeemed with justice and its returnees with righteousness” (Isaiah 1:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that this sentence does not belong here in the text; see Rabbi David Luria; <i>Etz Yosef</i>.</i>
Another matter, “these are the ordinances,” that is what is written: “For Solomon. Endow the king with Your justice, God…May he judge Your people with righteousness” (Psalms 72:1–2). Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] says: Just as the Holy One blessed be He cautioned regarding the commandments, so He cautioned regarding justice, upon which the world is contingent, as it is stated: “A king will uphold the land with justice” (Proverbs 29:4). And by its means, Zion will be rebuilt, as it is stated: “Zion will be redeemed with justice” (Isaiah 1:27). And by its means the righteous are uplifted, as it is stated: “Happy are those who heed the law” (Psalms 106:3). <br>You find that there are many ordinances regarding this matter. For the Holy One blessed be He said: “I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt, the house of slavery” (Exodus 20:2). What does it say regarding the Hebrew slave? “If you purchase a Hebrew slave [he shall serve six years]” (Exodus 21:2). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Just as I created the world in six days and rested on the seventh, so he shall work with you for six years and emerge as a free man.’ What is written alongside it? “If he comes in by himself” (Exodus 21:3); if he entered alone he shall depart alone, if [he came in] with his wife, he shall depart with her. “If his master gives him a wife…” (Exodus 21:4). Israel enters this situation only if they transgressed the mitzvot, because Israel is as dear as the apple of the supernal eye, as it is stated: “As anyone who touches you, touches the apple of his eye” (Zechariah 2:12). It is the scribes and the Sages who instituted this safeguard.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Zechariah is stated by God, such that it should have said “anyone who touches you touches the apple of My eye,” but the scribes changed it to “his eye” in order to avoid the challenges that might be caused by the anthropomorphism. Alternatively, the scribes did not change the text but merely taught that the verse means to refer to God’s eye, as it were (see Maharzu; <i>Etz Yosef</i>; <i>Matnot Kehuna</i> to <i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 49:7). </i> <br>It is analogous to a king who said to his son that he should work for so-and-so, who would not mistreat him.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">The king sought to punish his son by having him work, but arranged for him to work for a master who would not mistreat him. </i> He went and even though he worked without pay, [the master] did not refrain from mistreating him. When [the king] reconciled with his son, he decreed that those who had mistreated him would be put to death. So too, the Holy One blessed be He decreed that Israel would be enslaved in Egypt until He would be reconciled and return them. [The Egyptians] stood over them and enslaved them harshly, and not because [Israel] rebelled against them. Therefore God said of them: ‘They should have treated them like slaves and [Israel] would perform their needs until the decree was completed.’ But, “I was mildly enraged, but they contributed to the evil” (Zechariah 1:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">The Egyptians treated the Israelites far more harshly than they should have. </i> <br>Thus, after the commandments,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">After the Ten Commandments, in which God mentioned that He took Israel out of slavery in Egypt (Exodus 20:2). </i> the Holy One blessed be He cautioned them regarding the ordinances, that they should not violate them, as He would then do to them what He did to Egypt. That is why the prophet said to Israel: “Execute true justice, and…do not exploit the widow, the orphan, the stranger, and the poor” (Zechariah 7:9–10).
Rabbi Natan says: Justice is fitting for God, as He upholds it and does not show favor, as it is stated: “For I am the Lord, who performs kindness, justice and righteousness in the land” (Jeremiah 9:23), as we find regarding Abraham, who withstood ten ordeals, but He did not show him favor even for one matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">This translation is based on the textual emendation of Rabbi David Luria. </i> as He said: “Know, that your descendants will be strangers” (Genesis 15:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">When God told him that he would inherit the land, he asked: “How do I know that I will inherit it?” (Genesis 15:8). It was due to this question that God decreed that Abraham’s descendants would be slaves (see <i>Nedarim</i> 32a). </i> Nevertheless, he asked God to uphold justice, as it is stated: “Will the Judge of the earth not implement justice?” (Genesis 18:25). <br>See how King Solomon was caught in a trap, as it is stated: “He traps the wise with their craftiness” (Job 5:13). How many spirits and demons did Solomon conquer, and he instructed justice for everyone, but ultimately, he was trapped in his old age,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">He sought to outsmart the Torah and allowed himself to marry many wives, purchase many horses, and amass much silver and gold, in opposition to Torah law. He justified this by asserting that he would not fall prey to the dangers that the Torah wished to prevent by the institution of these laws (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 21b). </i> and he began fearing the spirits, as it is stated: “Each man, a sword on his thigh, from fear in the nights” (Song of Songs 3:8). Initially, the spirits were terrified of him, and ultimately, he began to fear them. That is why there is no mitzva<i> </i>that the Holy One blessed be He did not caution in its regard,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah hints to the punishment for the violation of each commandment. </i> as it is stated: “If a man sells his daughter as a maidservant” (Exodus 21:7). What caused this to happen to him? It is the transgression that he violated vis-à-vis others.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">He mistreated his Hebrew slave, which is the topic of the verses immediately prior to this verse. </i> <br>“One who strikes a man and he dies” (Exodus 21:12). What caused this to happen to him? The fact that he did not look into the Torah, in which it is written: “One who sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed” (Genesis 9:6). This is analogous to a person who marred the statue of the king and ascended to the platform.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">For judgment.</i> The king said to him: ‘Did you not read in my royal edicts that anyone who touches my statue is to be eliminated? Why did you not spare yourself?’ So too, if a person kills a person of Israel, it is as though he removes the image of a king, and he is sentenced and has no life, as man was created in the image of the ministering angels. If he kills unwittingly, God provides him with a place to which he can flee. If he kills intentionally, even if he is the High Priest, he is killed. You have no one greater than Saul, as it is stated: “Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul” (II Samuel 1:24). Who collected from him the blood that was on his hands when he died? It was not Israel who collected it, but rather the Givonites, as it is stated: “Let seven men of his sons be given to us [and we will hang them]” (II Samuel 21:6). The priests forgave him,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">They forgave him for the massacre in the priestly city of Nov.</i> but the Givonites did not forgive him. That is why God distanced them, as it is stated: “The Givonites were not of the children of Israel” (II Samuel 21:2). That is what David feared, as it is stated: “Save me from bloodshed, God” (Psalms 51:16).
Rabbi Shimon says: Many warnings are written here, as it is stated: “If men quarrel and one strikes the other” (Exodus 21:18). Nothing good and no peace results from a quarrel. Cain harmed his brother only from the midst of a quarrel, “one strikes another with a stone or a fist (Exodus 21:18). Here God cautions, as it is stated: “If he arises and walks outside…[he shall give only his livelihood and he shall provide healing]” (Exodus 21:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Even if one does not kill the other, he is obligated to pay for the damage he caused, including loss of livelihood and medical costs. </i> <br>Why is judges [<i>elohim</i>]<i> </i>written here, regarding each and every matter?<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">As the Torah presents the ordinances in Exodus chapters 21–23, there are several instances in which the Torah refers to judges as <i>elohim</i>, a term ordinarily reserved for God. See, e.g., Exodus 21:6, 22:7. </i> It is because people are steeped in the evil inclination, as it is stated: “As the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth” (Genesis 8:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, due to man’s weaknesses, the Torah uses a term for judges that also can be used to refer to God, as an indication that people should consider that they will be held accountable not only by man but by God. </i> If the Holy One blessed be He would eliminate the evil inclination, everyone would come under His wings. The Holy One blessed be He will kill it [one day]. You find that the evil inclination accustoms a person to sin, and it kills him, as it is stated: “Its justice and its onus will emerge from it” (Habakkuk 1:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Sin causes man to die. Alternatively, having caused man to sin, it is the evil inclination who then kills man, as the Gemara states: Satan, the evil inclination, and the Angel of Death are one (<i>Bava Batra</i> 16a). </i> That is why the Holy One blessed be He cautioned them regarding the ordinances of the Torah, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Maintain justice in this world and I will rescue you from being sentenced to Gehenna.’ Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He judges the wicked over all these laws, as it is stated: “Behold, I am here, and I will judge between the fat lamb and the lean lamb” (Ezekiel 34:20). <br>Egypt enslaved Israel, and He exacted retribution from them, and judged them in Egypt and judged them at the sea. To what were they comparable? To robbers who entered the king’s vineyard and destroyed grapevines. The king came and found his vineyard damaged. He became filled with rage and descended upon the robbers. He did not need anything or any person, but rather, he descended, cut them, and uprooted them, just as they had done to the king’s vineyard. So too, Egypt judged the children of God [and executed upon them] harsh judgments. The Holy One blessed be He became filled with rage and afflicted them with the first plague, and the second, but was not sated with their blood. He judged them ten times and said: ‘I have not done anything to them.’ They came to the sea and He killed countless multitudes. From where is it derived that Pharaoh will not be consoled over his multitudes until he will see Gog? As it is stated: “Pharaoh will see them and be consoled for his entire multitude” (Ezekiel 32:31).
Rabbi Meir says: “These are the ordinances,” the Holy One blessed be He entrusted justice to the elders of Israel, just as the Sanhedrin On High sits before God, as it is stated: “I was seeing until thrones were set in place, and the Ancient One sat…the court convened, and the books were opened” (Daniel 7:9–10).<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">The Sanhedrin sits before God, just as the heavenly Sanhedrin of angels (see <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 24:2) sits before God. </i> The Holy One blessed be He, who is called the Ancient One, sat to exact retribution against those who came against him arrogantly, as it is stated: “Do not speak exceedingly with arrogance” (I Samuel 2:3). This is analogous to a king whose guardsmen demeaned him regarding the royal garment in which he was clad. The king said to them: ‘You ignored everything [else] and occupied yourselves with the royal garment in which I am clad; as you live, I will change it and I will exact retribution against you.’ So too with these wicked ones who criticized the Ancient One. It is not that He is old, but that [Israel] had exhausted Him with their actions, as it is written: “You wearied the Lord with your words” (Malachi 2:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">God is described as ancient because He refrains from taking action against those who act against Israel, as though He were an old man, incapable of waging war. This is not the case, it is just that Israel has sinned. </i> He said to them: ‘I will change it,’ as it is stated: “Why is there red on Your garment?” (Isaiah 63:2), ‘and I will exact retribution against you,’ as it is stated: “The Lord will emerge like a warrior, He will arouse zealotry like a man of war” (Isaiah 42:13).
Rabbi Elazar said: The entire Torah is contingent on justice, that is why the Holy One blessed be He gave laws after the Ten Commandments. Because people pervert justice, He exacts retribution from them and teaches the entire world that He overturned Sodom only after it perverted justice, as it is stated: “[Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom…] pride, surfeit of bread and tranquil calm, [but she did not support the hand of the poor and indigent]” (Ezekiel 16:49). Jerusalem, too, was not exiled until she perverted justice, as it is stated: “They will not provide justice for an orphan and the cause of the widow will not come to them” (Isaiah 1:23). <br>Why did the Holy One blessed be He give the crown to Judah?<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">The kings of Israel descend from the tribe of Judah. </i> It is not that he was mightier than his brothers; were Simeon, Levi and the others not mighty? Rather, it is because he adjudicated a true judgment for Tamar;<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">See Genesis 38:26. </i> that is why he became a judge of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">In ancient times, the king served as the highest judge in the land. </i> This is analogous to a judge who adjudicated the case of an orphan girl that came before him and he exonerated her. So too, the case of Tamar came before Judah, and [her sentence was] to be burned, but he exonerated her because he found merit on her behalf. How so? Isaac and Jacob were sitting there, as well as all his brothers, and they were protecting him.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Although they recognized that the signet ring, cords, and staff presented by Tamar (see Genesis 38:25) belonged to Judah, the presentation of these artifacts did not prove that she had not engaged in a forbidden relationship. </i> Judah acknowledged the Omnipresent and said the truth of the matter, and said: “She is more righteous than I” (Genesis 38:26). The Holy One blessed be He appointed him king. <br>Likewise, ben Zoma would say and expound: You were shamed in this world; you will not be shamed in the World to Come in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, who is a consuming fire. Why? Because the shame in this world is nothing compared to the shame of standing [guilty] in the World to Come, as it is stated: “Therefore, everyone who is pious should pray to You [at the time of searching]” (Psalms 32:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">The time of searching is expounded to mean the day of death. The previous verse states: “I acknowledged my sin to You; I did not hide my iniquity. I said: I will confess my transgressions to the Lord. And You forgave the guilt of my sin, selah” (Psalms 32:5). Thus, this is understood to mean that every pious individual prays that he has the strength to confess his sins before he dies. </i>
Rabbi Yehoshua said: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Because I commanded you many laws, I will provide you with great reward. I cautioned you regarding all the mitzvot, which are your life, as it is stated: “One who observes a mitzva will not know an evil matter” (Ecclesiastes 8:5). The same is true of every matter that is written in this portion: one who kills a person; one who strikes an ox; one who ignites a field. For each and every one, I wrote its punishment alongside it and its reward alongside it.’ This is analogous to a king who prepared two paths, one filled with thorns, briers, and thistles, and one filled with fragrant plants. The blind walk on the bad path, and the thorns add wound upon wound. Those who can see walk on the good path, with the result that they walk [comfortably] and their clothes are perfumed from [the path]. So too, God prepared two paths, one for the righteous and one for the wicked. One who has no eyes walks on the path of the wicked, stumbles and does not recover, like Bilam the wicked, who was expelled from the world, and like Doeg and Aḥitofel who were distanced from life, and like Geiḥazi, who left the world with nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Bilam, Doeg, Aḥitofel, and Geiḥazi are the four commoners listed in the mishna in <i>Sanhedrin</i> (10:1) as having no portion in the World to Come. </i> However, the righteous, who walk in their innocence, are privileged, and their children after them, as it is stated: “One who walks innocently is a righteous man; happy are his children after him. (Proverbs 20:7).
Another matter, “these are the ordinances,” the punishment that is prepared for the wicked is plentiful. What is written in their regard: “He will rain burning coal upon the wicked…” (Psalms 11:6). Because they violate the mitzvot<i> </i>and the laws of the Torah that were given only after the commandments, their punishment is more severe than that of one who nullifies the commandments.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">One who sins in his relations with other people is punished more harshly than one who sins only toward God. The midrash states this regarding the verse “these are the ordinances” because the laws introduced in this passage pertain to interpersonal relations. </i> How so? Israel nullified: “You shall not have [other gods before Me]” (Exodus 20:3), and He forgave them, as idol worship has no substance but only arouses zealotry, as it is stated: “They would arouse His zealotry with strangers” (Deuteronomy 32:16). Likewise, it is written: “They exchanged their Glory for the molded image of a bull” (Psalms 106:20). But when Israel sinned at Shitim with licentiousness, twenty-four thousand of them fell.<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">See Numbers 25:1–9. </i> This is analogous to a princess who flirted with a eunuch. The king became angry at her. They said to him: ‘But did she not flirt with a eunuch?’<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">The eunuch is incapable of sexual relations. </i> He said: ‘I became angry only because she accustomed herself to flirting and licentiousness.’ Likewise, the Rabbis taught: Lightheartedness and frivolity accustom a person to licentiousness. When she engaged in licentiousness, they told her father that she received twenty-four severe lashes, and he was silent. So too, what benefit did Israel receive from the worship of idols, which do not see, do not hear, and do not speak, as it is stated: “May their makers be like them” (Psalms 115:8)?<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The preceding verses say: “Their idols are silver and gold, the work of the hand of man. They have mouths but do not speak; they have eyes but do not see; they have ears but do not hear; they have noses but do not smell; they have hands but do not feel; legs, but they do not walk; they do not speak with their throats” (Psalms 115:4–7). </i> However, for licentiousness, which is a matter of substance, they were punished. They were forgiven for idol worship, but regarding these laws and mitzvot, the Holy One blessed be He cautioned them, as it is stated: “Observe mitzvot<i> </i> and live” (Proverbs 7:2) and likewise, “Inscribe them on the tablet of your heart.” (Proverbs 7:3).
Another matter, “these are the ordinances,” the idolaters have judges and Israel has judges and you do not know the difference between them. This is analogous to an ill person whom a doctor came to visit. [The doctor] said to the members of his household: ‘Feed him everything that he requests.’ He went to [visit] another [patient] and said to [the members of his household]: ‘Make certain that he does not eat such-and-such item.’ They said to him: ‘To the first you said that he should eat what he wants, and to the second you said that he should not eat such-and-such item?’ He said to them: ‘The first one will not live; therefore, I said that he may eat everything that he wants. However, for this one, who will live, I said to be careful with him.’ So too, for the idolaters who separate themselves and do not engage in Torah study and do not fulfill it, it is stated: “I too gave them statutes that were not good, [and ordinances by which they could not live]” (Ezekiel 20:25). But about the mitzvot it is written: “Which a man shall perform and live by them” (Leviticus 18:5).
Another matter, “these are the ordinances,” that is what is written: “The might of the King is that He loves justice” (Psalms 99:4). Moses said to Israel: ‘The Holy One blessed be He gave you His Torah. If you do not perform the laws, He will take His Torah from you.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote"> A Torah scholar who does not seek to bring about justice among the populace will not succeed in his studies (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). This is derived from the <i>vav</i> at the first word of the phrase “these [<i>ve’eleh</i>] are the ordinances.” This <i>vav</i> connects the ordinances to the giving of the Torah in the preceding passage (Maharzu). </i> Why? Because the Holy One blessed be He gave you His Torah only so you will perform the laws,’ as it is stated: “The might of the King is that He loves justice.” If you perform the laws, the Holy One blessed be He is destined to restore your courts to you, as it is stated: “I will restore your judges as at first” (Isaiah 1:26). What is written thereafter? “Zion will be redeemed with justice” (Isaiah 1:27).
Another matter, “these are the ordinances,” that is what is written: “So said the Lord: Maintain justice and perform acts of charity” (Isaiah 56:1). That is what the verse states: “These too are for the wise: Showing favor in judgment is no good” (Proverbs 24:23). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘What caused the judges to know how to judge? It is due to the fact that you received the Torah in which it is written: “These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws”’ (Leviticus 26:46). But know that “showing favor in judgment is no good.” What is “no good”? When a judge sits and judges truthfully, the Holy One blessed be He forsakes the heavens of heavens, as it were, and rests His Divine Presence alongside him, as it is stated: “And that the Lord would establish judges for them, and the Lord would be with the judge” (Judges 2:18). When He sees that he is showing favor, He removes His Divine Presence, as it were, and ascends heavenward. The angels say to Him: ‘Master of the universe, what is disturbing You?’ He says to them: ‘I saw that the judge is showing favor and I departed from there,’ as it is stated: “Because of the robbery of the poor and the groans of the needy, the Lord says: Now I will arise” (Psalms 12:6). What does the Holy One blessed be He do? He draws His sword against him, to apprise that there is a Judge on high, as it is stated: “Beware of the sword, for fury by the sword will be for iniquity, so that you will know that there is punishment [<i>shadun</i>]” (Job 19:29); it is written <i>shadin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The word is traditionally written with a <i>yod</i>, such that it reads <i>shadin</i>, but it is traditionally pronounced <i>shadun</i>, as though written with a <i>vav</i>.</i> that there is justice [<i>sheyesh din</i>] in the world. Therefore, Solomon said: “These too are for the wise: Showing favor in judgment is no good.” The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘It is not good for you that I forsake you, as it is stated: “The Lord is good; He is a stronghold on the day of trouble and knows those who take refuge in Him” (Nahum 1:7). That is why it is written: “So said the Lord: Maintain justice and perform acts of charity,” and I will bring Myself close to you, as it is stated: “For My salvation is soon to come”’ (Isaiah 56:1). <br>Likewise you find regarding Nebuchadnezzar. When he saw the dream, Daniel entered to him and saw that [God] was destined to drive him away, as it is stated: “You will be driven from men” (Daniel 4:29). He pretended to be trembling and fearful, as it is stated: “Then Daniel, whose name was Beltshatzar, was astonished for some time [and his thoughts terrified him]” (Daniel 4:16). [Nebuchadnezzar] said to him: ‘Why are you afraid?’ [Daniel] said to him: ‘I see the dream but I am unable to say it,’ and said to him: “My lord, may the dream be for your enemy, and its interpretation for your foe” (Daniel 4:16). One who expounds this verse renders Daniel one who spoke impudently vis-à-vis the Most High, as he said to Nebuchadnezzar: “My lord, may the dream be for your enemy.” There was no greater enemy of his than the Holy One blessed be He, as [Nebuchadnezzar] had destroyed His house and exiled His children. Moreover, Israel, too, was his enemy, and he was cursing them.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">It was as though Daniel was cursing them by wishing upon them Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. </i> However, Daniel directed his heart to the Holy One blessed be He, and said: ‘My Master who is in Heaven, bring this dream upon this enemy of Yours.’ Nebuchadnezzar said to Daniel: ‘I saw in my dream: “Behold, a tree in the midst of the land…and there was food for everyone in it”’ (Daniel 4:7, 9). This [symbolizes] a king who issues an edict, blockades the sea and everyone dies; he lifts the blockade on the sea and everyone lives. Therefore, “there was food for everyone in it.” <br>Once [Daniel] told him the meaning of the dream, [Nebuchadnezzar] said to him: ‘What is your advice to me?’ He said to him: “Therefore, king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: redeem your sins with charity” (Daniel 4:24). The Holy One blessed be He said to [Daniel]: ‘I conveyed [the value of] charity to Abraham, as it is stated: “For I have known him, so that he will command…[to perform acts of charity]” (Genesis 18:19), and you say to this wicked one: “Redeem your sins with charity”?’<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">God did not want Nebuchadnezzar to know that he could expiate his sins via charity. </i> Rather, he said to Nebuchadnezzar: ‘Perform acts of charity and open your storehouses’ because he saw that Israel had departed Jerusalem naked, without the value of a <i>peruta </i>in their possession. That is why he said to him to perform acts of charity.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel’s intention in advising Nebuchadnezzar was to provide for the destitute Jewish refugees for the benefit of the Jews, not for the benefit of Nebuchadnezzar. </i> <br>He opened his storehouses and he was supporting Israel for twelve months. “At the end of twelve months [he was walking atop the royal palace of Babylon]” (Daniel 4:26). Nebuchadnezzar heard the sound [of a crowd] gathering. He said: ‘From where is that sound coming?’ They said to him: ‘It is those poor people to whom you said to give a portion, and we have been distributing it to them for twelve months, as you said.’ He said: ‘Had it not been for the wealth that I had, with what would I have constructed this entire province in my honor, as it is stated: “The king spoke, saying: Is this not the great Babylon?” (Daniel 4:27), and I am wasting all my property? If my property will be gone, I will have no honor.’ He locked the storehouses. Once he said that, a Divine Voice responded to him from Heaven, as it is stated: “While the matter was yet in the mouth of the king, a voice fell from the heavens: [To you it is said, King Nebuchadnezzar, the kingdom is removed from you]” (Daniel 4:28). What caused you to sit in tranquility for twelve months? It was the charity. If for this wicked one it is so, for Israel all the more so. That is, “maintain justice and perform acts of charity” (Isaiah 56:1). <br>This is analogous<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">This analogy pertains to the continuation of the verse cited above from Isaiah, “for My salvation is soon to come” (Isaiah 56:1). </i> to a person who entered a province and heard that a gladiatorial exhibition was taking place. He went and he asked a gladiator: ‘When will the gladiatorial exhibition take place?’ He said to him: ‘It is far off.’ He went and asked the one staging the exhibition. He said: ‘It is soon.’ That one said: ‘Did I not ask the gladiator, and he said it was far off?’ He said to him: ‘You thought to ask the gladiator? Does he wish me to stage the exhibition? Does he not know that he will participate and be killed?’ So too, Israel asked Bilam: ‘When will the salvation be?’ He said to them: “I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near” (Numbers 24:17). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Is this what you thought? Do you not know that ultimately Bilam will descend to Gehenna and does not want My salvation to come? Rather, emulate your patriarch: “For Your salvation I await, Lord” (Genesis 49:18). Anticipate salvation, as it is near.’ That is why it is stated: “For My salvation is soon to come” (Isaiah 56:1). <br>Another matter, “for My salvation is soon to come,” ‘for your salvation is soon’ is not written, but rather, “My salvation.” May His name be blessed. Had the matter not been written, it would have been impossible to say it. The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘If you do not have merit, I will do it for My sake. As it were, all the days that you are there in distress, I am with you, as it is stated: “I will be with him in distress” (Psalms 91:15). And I will redeem Myself, as it is stated: “He saw that there was no man and He was astonished…[His arm brought salvation for Him]”’ (Isaiah 59:16). Likewise it says: “Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; cheer, daughter of Jerusalem: Behold, your king will come to you; he is righteous and redeemed” (Zechariah 9:9). ‘And redeeming,’ is not written here, but rather, “redeemed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Although the plain meaning of the verse refers to a human king, the midrash takes it to allude to God, who is described as redeeming Himself. </i> That is, even if you do not have actions to your credit, the Holy One blessed be He will do it for His sake, as it is stated: “For My salvation is soon to come.” <br>Another matter, “maintain justice and perform acts of charity,” (Isaiah 56:1), that is what is written: “I performed justice and acts of charity; do not leave me to my oppressors” (Psalms 119:121). Israel said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, see that we are seeking to perform justice and acts of charity, but we fear the idolaters; do not deliver us into their hands.’ That is, “I have performed justice and acts of charity.” This is analogous<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The following analogy pertains to the conclusion of the verse in Isaiah 56:1, which states “and My righteousness to be revealed.” </i> to a merchant who sought to travel on the road, but heard that there were robbers on the road. What did he do? He took his merchandise and exchanged it for gems and diamonds. He set out on the road and the robbers apprehended him. They said to him: ‘What do you have in your possession?’ He said to them: ‘Glassware.’ They said to him: ‘How much is this worth?’ He said to them: ‘Two for a <i>sela</i>, three for a <i>sela</i>.’ They said to each other: ‘For this will we kill him?’ They left him alone. He entered the city. He began opening the chests and he sat and began selling. Those robbers entered and saw him sitting and selling. They said to him: ‘How much for this?’ He said: ‘This is for twenty gold pieces, that is for thirty gold pieces.’ They said to him: ‘Are you not the one who said to us on the way: Two for a <i>sela</i>, three for a <i>sela</i>?’ He said to them: ‘Yes. However, at that moment I was in a place of death.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">I said so because my life was in danger. </i> Now, if you do not give me its price, you will not take it.’ So it is for Israel. In this world, one who performs mitzvot does not know the reward to be given for them. However, in the World to Come, when they see the reward given for mitzvot, they will be astonished, as the entire world is not able to contain the reward, as it is stated: “They never take heed, they did not they listen; no eye has seen [besides You, God, that which He will do for one who awaits Him]” (Isaiah 64:3). Have they never heard? It is, rather, that they are unable to hear the reward given for mitzvot.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">In this world, they cannot comprehend the reward given for mitzvot. </i> That is why it is stated: “For My salvation is soon to come, [and My righteousness to be revealed]” (Isaiah 56:1). <br>The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I will bring the salvation, as it is stated: “Salvation belongs to the Lord” (Psalms 3:9). One who performs justice, I write in his regard that he brings the salvation near.’ Likewise, you find regarding Yehoshafat, who appointed judges, as it is stated: “He <Yehoshafat> appointed judges” (II Chronicles 19:5). When the children of Amon and Moav came, they were standing, and the Holy One blessed be He was waging their war, as it is stated: “For the war is not yours, but God’s” (II Chronicles 20:15), just as Moses our master, may peace be upon him, said: “The Lord will wage war for you” (Exodus 14:14). Why? Because they performed justice, they caused the salvation to come. That is why it is stated: “Maintain justice and perform acts of charity, for My salvation is soon to come” (Isaiah 56:1). That is, “these are the ordinances.” What is written thereafter? “If you purchase a Hebrew slave, [six years he shall work, and in the seventh he shall go free]” (Exodus 21:2).

Chapter 31

<b>“If you lend money to My people, to the poor who is with you, you shall not be as a creditor to him; you shall not impose interest upon him” (Exodus 22:24).</b> <br>“If you lend money to My people,” that is what is written: “It is good for a man to be gracious and to lend, conducting his affairs with justice” (Psalms 112:5). There is no person who is not in debt to God, but He is merciful and gracious and pardons all former transgressions, as it is stated: “Do not remember for us our former iniquities” (Psalms 79:8). This is analogous to one who borrowed from a moneylender and he forgot about it. Sometime later, he came and stood before him and said to him: ‘I know that I am in debt to you.’ He said to him: ‘Why did you remind me? The original debt is already removed from my mind.’ So it is with the Master of the universe. People sin before Him, He sees that they do not repent, and He absolves them [of their sins] one by one. When they repent, they come to mention their initial liability and He says to them: “Do not remember former matters” (Isaiah 43:18). From where do you derive that if a person repented, even if he has committed numerous iniquities, He transforms them into merits? From what is written: “And when the wicked one repents his wickedness, and performs justice and acts of charity, he will live” (Ezekiel 33:19); all the transgressions that he performed will not be remembered for him. That is why He cautions regarding the poor person: “You shall not be as a creditor to him”; do not make him stand naked.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Act mercifully toward him just as God does toward you, and do not take everything he has. </i> “It will be when he cries to Me, I will hear, as I am gracious” (Exodus 22:26). Likewise, David says: “They cry out and the Lord hears them” (Psalms 34:18).
Rabbi Abahu says: It is written: “Three pilgrimage festivals you shall hold a festival to Me during the year” (Exodus 23:14). The Holy One blessed be He established three pilgrimage festivals, and the Torah, due to the merit of the patriarchs, who would not come before the Holy One blessed be He empty-handed.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, in the merit of the forefathers, Israel keeps the three pilgrimage festivals, on which they are also commanded not to come before God empty-handed (Exodus 23:15). Additionally, the fact that they have not forgotten the Torah is also due to the merit of the forefathers (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Even in these generations, even though they are suffering, the Torah does not move from them, as it is stated: “They will not move from your mouth, or from the mouth of your descendants, or from the mouth of the descendants of your descendants…” (Isaiah 59:21). This is analogous to one who had a case come before the king, and he had advocates pleading on his behalf. So too, if a person performs mitzvot, and he is a learned person and one who performs acts of kindness, when the [heavenly] accuser is standing and prosecuting, advocates are standing opposite him and speaking in [the man’s] favor, as it is stated: “A man’s giving expands him” (Proverbs 18:16). What he does with the poor assists him. That is why it is stated: “Happy is one who attends to the indigent; [the Lord will deliver him in times of trouble]” (Psalms 41:2).
Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” that is what is written: “There is a grave evil that I have seen under the sun: Wealth kept for its owner to his detriment. That wealth is lost in an ill-fated matter” (Ecclesiastes 5:12–13). Happy is the person who withstands his ordeal, as there is no person whom the Holy One blessed be He does not subject to an ordeal. He tests the wealthy as to whether he will be generous to the poor. He tests the poor as to whether he is able to withstand suffering without becoming angry, as it is stated: “And bring the wretched [<i>merudim</i>] poor to your home” (Isaiah 58:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>merudim</i> implies one who is lowly [<i>yarud</i>] in the sense of being contrite and humble (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> If the wealthy person withstands his ordeal and performs acts of charity, he will benefit from his wealth in this world, the principal remains intact for him in the World to Come, and the Holy One blessed be He rescues him from the sentence of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Happy is one who attends to the indigent; the Lord will deliver him in times of trouble” (Psalms 41:2). If the poor person withstands his ordeal and does not rebel, he will receive a double portion in the future, as it is stated: “The Lord added to Job double of everything that he had” (Job 42:10). But the wealthy man who is miserly, he and his wealth depart from this world, as it is stated: “That wealth is lost in an ill-fated matter” (Ecclesiastes 5:13), because he is miserly vis-à-vis the charity collectors. Why? Because there is a rotating wheel in the world; it is not the case that one who is wealthy today is wealthy tomorrow, and one who is poor today is poor tomorrow. Rather, He humbles this one and He elevates that one, as it is stated: “But it is God who is the Judge; He humbles this one and elevates that one” (Psalms 75:8). <br>Come and see: There is wealth that causes harm to its owner, and there is wealth that brings benefit to its owner. [Wealth that] causes harm to its owner, this is the wealth of Koraḥ, who was wealthier than all Israel, and it is written: “They, and everything that was theirs, descended alive into the abyss” (Numbers 16:33). Alternatively, it is the wealth of Haman the wicked, as it is stated: “Haman related to them the honor of his wealth,” (Esther 5:11), and it is written: “They hanged him and his sons on the gallows” (Esther 9:25). [Wealth] that brings benefit to its owner, this is the wealth of Yehoshafat, as it is stated: “Yehoshafat had abundant wealth and honor” (II Chronicles 18:1). What happened to him? “Yehoshafat cried out and the Lord aided him” (II Chronicles 18:31). <br>There is valor that benefits its possessor, and there is [valor] that is harmful for its possessor. [Valor that] benefits its possessor, this is David, as it is written: “Saul smote his thousands, and David his tens of thousands” (I Samuel 18:7). As a result, all of Israel loved him, as it is stated: “All of Israel and Judah loved David” (I Samuel 18:16). [Valor that is] harmful for its possessor, this is the valor of Goliath, who would stand and blaspheme. What happened to him? He died like a dog, as it is stated: “The Philistines saw that their hero had died, and they fled” (I Samuel 17:51). <br>There is wisdom that benefits its possessor, and there is [wisdom] that is harmful for its possessor. [Wisdom that] benefits its possessor, this is Joshua, as it is stated: “Joshua, son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom” (Deuteronomy 34:9). To what was he comparable? To a pool that provides water for an entire city, and everyone praises it. One said to the others: ‘Praise the spring that feeds it.’ So too, they would praise Joshua, who would give all of Israel to drink from his wisdom. He said to them: ‘Praise Moses who produced this,’ as it is stated: “As Moses had placed his hands upon him” (Deuteronomy 34:9). [Wisdom that is] harmful for its possessor, this is Bilam, as it is stated: “The utterance of one who heard the sayings of God” (Numbers 24:16). What happened to him: “Bilam ben Beor, they killed by sword” (Numbers 31:8). That is why it is stated: “Wealth kept for its owner to his detriment.”
Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” that is what is written: “He did not lend his money with usury” (Psalms 15:5). Come and see that anyone who has wealth and gives charity to the poor, and does not lend with interest, it is ascribed to him as though he fulfilled all the mitzvot, as it is stated: “He does not lend his money with usury, nor does he take bribes against the innocent. One who performs these will never stumble” (Psalms 15:5). <br>Who was [an example of] this? Ovadya, who was the wealthy steward of Ahab, as it is stated: “Ahab summoned Ovadya, who was over the household” (I Kings 18:3). He was exceptionally wealthy and he expended all his belongings for charity, as he would sustain the prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See I Kings 18:4. </i> When all that evil transpired,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The great famine described in I Kings chapter 18, which had been brought about by Elijah (see I Kings 17:1). </i> he would borrow with interest from Yehoram son of Ahab, just enough to be sufficient for the prophets. He fulfilled: “He did not lend his money with usury.” However, Yehoram, who lent with interest, God said: ‘Does this one still exist? Let Yehu come and kill him,’ as it is stated: “Yehu drew his bow fully, and he smote Yehoram between his shoulders; the arrow came out from his heart” (II Kings 9:24). Why “between his shoulders; the arrow came out from his heart”? It is because he had hardened his heart and had extended his arms to collect the interest, to realize what is stated: “He gave with usury and took interest, shall he live? He shall not live” (Ezekiel 18:13). That is why He cautions them: “If you lend money to My people…[you shall not impose interest upon him].” <br>In Jerusalem, too, they would do so, as it is stated: “Your silver has become dross [<i>lesigim</i>]” (Isaiah 1:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is expounded to mean: Your money has become more [<i>sagi</i>], meaning that they collected interest.</i> What happened to them? “Rejected silver they called them [as the Lord has rejected them]” (Jeremiah 6:30). Likewise, “they will cast their silver into the streets” (Ezekiel 7:19). Why? It is because they violated what is written in the Torah: “Do not give him your money with usury” (Leviticus 25:37).
Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” when Solomon built the Temple, he said to the Holy One blessed be He in his prayer: ‘Master of the universe, if there is a person who prays before You that You should give him money, and You know that it will be harmful for him, do not give it to him. If you see a person for whom wealth is becoming, give it to him,’ as it is stated: “You shall give that man according to his ways, as You know his heart” (I Kings 8:39; II Chronicles 6:30). In this world, the wicked are wealthy and live in tranquility and serenity, and the righteous are poor. But in the future, when the Holy One blessed be He will open the storehouses of the Garden of Eden for the righteous, the wicked who consumed usury [<i>neshekh</i>] and interest, will bite [<i>noshekhin</i>] their own flesh with their teeth, as it is stated: “The fool folds his hands, and eats his own flesh” (Ecclesiastes 4:5). They will say: ‘If only we had been laborers and we had carried on our shoulders. If only we had been slaves, and it would be like this for us,’ as it is stated: “A handful of tranquility is preferable to two handfuls of toil and herding wind” (Ecclesiastes 4:6). That is why it is stated: “If you lend money to My people…[you shall not impose interest upon him].” <br>Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Who are your people?’ He said to them: ‘The poor,’ as it is stated: “For the Lord has comforted His people and He will be merciful to His poor” (Isaiah 49:13). The attribute of a flesh and blood [person] is that if one has poor relatives and he is wealthy, he does not acknowledge them, as it is stated: “All the brethren of the poor hate him” (Proverbs 19:7). But the Holy One blessed be He is not so, as it is stated: “The wealth and the honor are from before You” (I Chronicles 29:12), and He shelters only the poor, as it is stated: “For the Lord has established Zion and in it the poor of His people will be sheltered” (Isaiah 14:32). That is why it is stated: “If you lend money to My people, [to the poor who is with you].” David said: ‘Master of the universe, let Your world be settled in peace,’ as it is stated: “May he abide before God forever” (Psalms 61:8). He said to him: ‘If I render My world equal, “kindness and truth, that they might preserve him”’ (Psalms 61:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Were everyone equal, there would be no opportunity to perform acts of kindness and charity.</i>
“You shall not be as a creditor to him.” If you lent to him, do not pressure him. If he has a field or a vineyard, do not say to him: ‘Take a <i>maneh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">One hundred <i>zuz</i>.</i> invest it in business, and write a writ designating your field or your vineyard to guarantee repayment to me.’ The next day, he will lose his business investment and you will repossess his field or his vineyard. Therefore, it is written: “You shall not be as a creditor to him.” From here you learn that anyone who takes interest is not God-fearing.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is based upon the verse: “Do not take interest or increase; you shall fear your God” (Leviticus 25:36). Some amend the text of the midrash such that it cites the verse from Leviticus (see Rabbi David Luria). </i> <br>Likewise, Ezekiel says: “He gave with usury and took interest, shall he live? He shall not live” (Ezekiel 18:13). This is analogous to one who had his indictment read before the judge. The judge said: ‘Is he still alive?’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He deserves to have been killed for his previous crimes. </i> So too the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Shall he live? He shall not live, he took usury and interest.’ <br>Another matter, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘One who subsisted from interest in this world will not live in the World to Come. He bore a son and he did not take interest.’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on Ezekiel 18:14–17. After describing a man who takes interest, among other sins, and will die due to his transgressions, the prophet describes this sinner as having a son who does not commit the transgressions of his father, and as a result will not die. </i> They said to Him:<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The angels said to God.</i> ‘His father would take usury.’ He said to them: ‘Why do I care? I wrote: “A son will not bear the iniquity of the father, the soul that sins, it will die”’ (Ezekiel 18:20). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘You say that the son should die. Even the father, had he sought to repent and to reclaim his life, I would accept him, as it is stated: “But the wicked person, if he repents…[he shall surely live, he shall not die]” (Ezekiel 18:21); if he repents wholeheartedly, I accept him.’ That is why it is stated: “You shall not be as a creditor to him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This refers back to the statements above regarding the severity of this transgression. </i> <br>“You shall not impose [<i>lo tesimun</i>] usury upon him” (Exodus 22:24). It should have said only “you shall not impose [<i>lo tasim</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">In the singular.</i> What is “you shall not impose [<i>lo tesimun</i>]”?<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Why is it stated in the plural?</i> These are the witnesses, the guarantor, the judges, and the scribe, as were it not for them, he would not take anything; therefore, they are all punished. From where is it derived that the borrower is punished? It is, as it is stated: “You shall not lend with interest [<i>tashikh</i>] to your brother” (Deuteronomy 23:20).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>tashikh</i> can also be translated such that the verse would mean: You shall not facilitate your brother taking interest. </i> To what is interest comparable? To one whom a serpent bit, but he did not sense what had bitten him, and he did not discover it until [the venom] proliferated in him. So too, with interest, a person does not sense it until it proliferates upon him.
<b>“If you take your neighbor’s garment as collateral, you shall return it to him by the setting of the sun” (Exodus 22:25).</b> <br>“If you take…collateral [<i>ḥavol taḥbol</i>].” God says to him: ‘Although he is indebted to you, you are indebted to Me,’ as it is stated: “When they sin against You, as there is no person who does not sin” (II Chronicles 6:36). There are two matters here, <i>ḥavol taḥbol</i>. The verse teaches you that if he takes the plowshare, he rises early and returns it.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">If a creditor takes an essential item from the debtor that the debtor needs during the daytime, the creditor may take it by night but must return it before the debtor would start work during the day. This is derived from the phrase <i>ḥavol taḥbol</i>, as <i>ḥavol</i> means take, and <i>taḥbol</i> can be translated “give”.</i> One verse says: “You shall return it to him by the setting of the sun,” and one verse says: “With the rising of the sun” (Deuteronomy 24:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Deuteronomy quoted here is often translated “with the setting of the sun,” but the midrash interprets it as referring to the rising of the sun (see <i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> On this basis you deduce that you must return to him an item in which he may sleep, as the verse said: “By the setting of the sun.” In the morning, you must return the plowshare to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The creditor must return the collateral by sundown if it is an item that the debtor would need to use at night, and by sunrise if it is an item that the debtor would need to use by day. </i> Likewise, it states regarding the laborer: “On his day you shall give his wage” (Deuteronomy 24:15). Why? “Because he is a poor man” (Deuteronomy 24:15). And it says: “For that alone is his covering” (Exodus 22:26), as he does not have “in what shall he lie” (Exodus 22:26). He will be sitting all night and the cold will harm him. He will cry out to Me and I will answer him, as it is stated: “[It shall be that when he cries out to Me,] I will hear, as I am gracious” (Exodus 22:26). <br>There are two matters here that are similar to one another. Regarding a day laborer, it is written: “On his day you shall give his wage.” For example, one was walking with his donkey after him. They sold him one sheaf; he placed it on his shoulder, and the donkey came on the road after the sheaf, anticipating to eat it.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The man placed the sheaf on his shoulder so that the donkey would follow him because it anticipated eating the sheaf. </i> What did his master do to it? He tied the sheaf above him. They said to him: ‘Wicked one, all this way it ran for it, and you did not place it before him?’ So too, the day laborer toils and suffers all day because he is anticipating his wage and [yet the employer] sends him away empty-handed. Likewise it is written: “And he has his heart set on it” (Deuteronomy 24:15).
<b>“For that alone is his covering, it is his garment for his skin; in what shall he lie? It shall be that when he cries out to Me, I will hear, as I am gracious” (Exodus 22:26). <br>“You shall not curse judges, and a prince among your people you shall not revile” (Exodus 22:27).</b> <br>“I will hear, as I am gracious.” What is written thereafter? “You shall not curse judges” (Exodus 22:27). What does this matter have to do with that? Our Rabbis said: There was an incident involving one who had a court case and came before the judge, and he exonerated him. The one who was exonerated emerged and said: ‘Judge so and so, there is no one like him in the world.’ Some time later, he had a court case and came before him, and he declared him liable. He emerged from before him and said: ‘There is no judge more foolish than he is.’ They said to him: ‘Yesterday he was praiseworthy and today a fool?’ That is why the verse cautions you: “You shall not curse judges.” If you curse, you are cursing your crops,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment for cursing a judge is that one will have a poor crop. </i> as it is stated: “The surfeit of your crop and the outpouring of your juices you shall not delay” (Exodus 22:28). That is why they are written one after the other. <br>Likewise you find that when judges are cursed, the crops diminish, as it is stated: “It was in the days when the judges judged [<i>shefot hashofetim</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets this phrase to mean “it was in the days of judging the judges.” </i> there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1). That is why it is stated: “The surfeit of your crop and the outpouring of your juices you shall not delay.” Do not tithe improperly. Do not separate the tithe and then <i>teruma</i>, and not the second tithe and then the first tithe. That is why it says: “You shall not delay.” But if you separate them properly, I will grant you male children, as it is stated: “The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me” (Exodus 22:28), as in the wilderness, the firstborn of Israel were priests, as it is stated: “He sent the young men of the children of Israel [and they sacrificed burnt offerings]” (Exodus 24:5). When they sinned with the Calf, the Holy One blessed be He removed them and installed the Levites in their place, as it says: “I have taken the Levites…in place of every firstborn” (Numbers 3:12). That is why it is stated: “The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me.”
<b>“So you shall do to your bull and to your flock; seven days it shall be with its mother, on the eighth day you shall give it to Me” (Exodus 22:29). <br>“You shall be holy people to Me; you shall not eat flesh of a mauled animal in the field; you shall cast it to the dog” (Exodus 22:30).</b> <br>“So you shall do to your bull,” “from the eighth day on [it may be accepted as an offering made by fire to the Lord]” (Leviticus 22:27). Likewise, it is written: “On the eighth day you shall give it to Me.”<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Just as in Leviticus the meaning of the verse is that from the eighth day and on the animal is acceptable as an offering, that is the meaning here as well; the verse is not stating that one is required to offer it on the eighth day. </i> If you give, you are not giving from yours, but from Mine.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash interprets the phrase “you shall give it to Me” as though it said “you shall give it; it is Mine.” </i> Likewise it says: “For everything comes from You, and from Your hand we have given to You” (I Chronicles 29:14). If you do so, “you shall be holy people to Me” (Exodus 22:30). Likewise it is written: “Israel is sacred to the Lord, the first of His crop” (Jeremiah 2:3). Just as this pile of grain, it stands and the priest descends into it and takes <i>teruma</i> from its midst, so too, the Holy One blessed be He made the world into a pile and took our ancestors, who are His <i>teruma</i>, as it is stated: “Israel is sacred to the Lord, the first of His crop.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teruma</i> is also referred to as the first of the crop (see Deuteronomy 18:4). </i> <br>Consequently, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Because you are <i>teruma</i>, you do not have permission to eat a mauled animal,’ as it is stated: “You shall not eat flesh of a mauled animal in the field; you shall cast it to the dog.” Why to a dog? The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You owe it to the dogs, for when I killed the Egyptian firstborn and the Egyptians were sitting all night and burying their dead, the dogs were barking at them, but they did not bark at Israel, as it is stated: “But for all the children of Israel, a dog will not whet its tongue” (Exodus 11:7). Therefore, you owe it to the dogs, as it is stated: “You shall cast it to the dog.” Dogs, when one barks all of them gather and bark for nothing, but you shall not do so, because you are sacred people, as it is stated: “You shall be holy people to Me.”’
Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” that is what is written: “Rejected silver they called them [as the Lord has rejected them]” (Jeremiah 6:30). When Israel was exiled from Jerusalem, the enemies took them out in chains and the nations of the world were saying: ‘The Holy One blessed be He does not want this nation,’ as it is stated: “Rejected silver they called them.” Just as silver is refined and crafted into a vessel, and again refined and crafted into a vessel, and likewise several times, but the last time the person crumbles it in his hand and it is no longer used in crafting, so too, they would say of Israel that they have no possibility of recovery because the Holy One blessed be He has rejected them, as it is stated: “Rejected silver they called them.” <br>When Jeremiah heard this, he came to the Holy One blessed be He, and said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, is it true that You have rejected your children?’ That is what is written: “Have You rejected Judah, has Your soul despised Zion? Why have You smitten us and we have no cure?” (Jeremiah 14:19). This is analogous to one who would beat his wife. Her friend said to him: ‘Until when will you continue to beat her? If you wish to divorce her, beat her until she dies. If you do not wish to divorce her, why are you beating her?’ [The husband] said to him: ‘Even if my entire palace is destroyed, I will not divorce my wife.’ So too, Jeremiah said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘If you wish to send us away, smite us until we die, as it is stated: “For, You have rejected us, You have been exceedingly angry with us” (Lamentations 5:22). If not, why have you smitten us and there is no cure?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Even if I were to destroy My world, I will not send Israel away,’ as it is stated: “So said the Lord: If the heavens above can be measured [and the foundations of the earth below probed, I too will spurn all the descendants of Israel]” (Jeremiah 31:36).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Just as the heavens and the foundations of the earth cannot be measured, so God will not spurn all the descendants of Israel.</i> <br>Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Nevertheless, I have stipulated a condition with them. If they sin, the Temple will be taken as collateral for them, as it is stated: “I will place My abode [<i>mishkani</i>] among you”’ (Leviticus 26:11); do not read it as My abode [<i>mishkani</i>], but rather, as My collateral [<i>mashkoni</i>]. Likewise Bilam said: “How goodly are your tents, Jacob, your dwellings [<i>mishkenotekha</i>], Israel” (Numbers 24:5) – two instances of collateral.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the fact that the word dwellings [<i>mishkenotekha</i>] is in plural. The allusion is to the two Temples, which were destroyed as a form of collection of debt due to Israel’s sins. </i> They are called “your tents,” when they are built, and your dwellings [<i>mishkenotekha</i>]<i> </i>when they are destroyed. ‘It is not because I have a debt to the idolaters that I give them My Sanctuary as collateral, but rather your iniquities cause Me to give them My Temple as collateral. Were it not so, what debt do I have to them?’ As it is stated: “So said the Lord: Where is the your mother's writ of divorce with which I sent her away, or to whom among My creditors did I sell you? Behold, for your iniquities you were sold, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away” (Isaiah 50:1). ‘And so I stipulated with Moses in their regard, as it is stated: “If you lend money to My people, to the poor who is with you, you shall not be as a creditor to him.” But if you violate these mitzvot, I will take two instances of collateral, as it is stated: “If you take your neighbor’s garment as collateral [<i>ḥavol taḥbol</i>].”’<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The double term <i>ḥavol taḥbol</i> implies two instances of the taking of collateral, representing the destruction of the two Temples. </i> Moses said to Him: ‘Will they forever be taken as collateral?’ He said to him: ‘No, only until “the setting of the sun”’ – until Messiah comes, as it is stated: “But the sun will shine for you, those who fear My name, a sun of righteousness and healing” (Malachi 3:20).
Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” that is what is written: “One who increases his wealth through usury and interest amasses it for the sake of one who is gracious to the indigent” (Proverbs 28:8). There is a person who is wealthy, and he lends with interest and amasses much money, but he dies without children and all his money enters the royal treasury. What does the king do with that money? He constructs platforms, bathhouses, benches, and lavatories for the use of the poor. That is, “amasses it for the sake of one who is gracious to the indigent.” <br>Another matter, “one who increases his wealth through usury,” this is Esau the wicked, who was a lender with usury and interest. For whom did he accrue this money? For Israel, as it is stated: “For the sake of one who is gracious to the indigent.” And it is stated: “They will plunder their plunderers and loot their looters” (Ezekiel 39:10). That is why the Holy One blessed be He cautioned Israel not to lend with interest, so that others will not consume their belongings. That is, “if you lend money to My people, to the poor.”
Another matter, “you shall not be as a creditor to him,” that is what is written: “One who cares for the poor lends to the Lord, and He will pay his reward.” (Proverbs 19:17). To what extent? “A borrower is a servant to a man who lends” (Proverbs 22:7). <br>Another matter, “to the poor who is with you,” there is nothing in the world as harsh as poverty, as it is harsher than all the suffering in the world. Our Rabbis said: All forms of suffering on one side, and poverty on the other. If it is your wish to know, come and see: When the accuser was denouncing Job to the Holy One blessed be He and saying to Him: ‘You gave him money and children and You protect them, as it is stated: “[Satan answered the Lord…] Have You not sheltered him, his household, and everything that is his?” (Job 1:9-10), and it says: “Is it for nothing that Job reveres God?” (Job 1:9); “however, extend Your hand now”’ (Job 1:11), the Holy One blessed be He said to [Job]: ‘What do you prefer, poverty or suffering?’ Job said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, I accept upon myself all the suffering in the world, but not poverty, for when I go out to the marketplace and I do not have in my possession a <i>peruta</i> with which to purchase, what will I eat?’ After he suffered, what is written? He began railing against the attribute of justice, as it is stated: “If only I could know and find Him” (Job 23:3). Elihu said to him: ‘Why are you shouting? Did you not say that you do not seek poverty, but rather, suffering? Was it not you who chose the suffering, as it is stated: “Beware, do not turn to injustice, for you have chosen this over poverty”?’ (Job 36:21). Thus, poverty is harsher than all types of suffering. That is why it is stated: “To the poor who is with you.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Is his poverty not enough, such that you are taking interest from him?’ That is, “to the poor who is with you.”
Another matter, “to the poor who is with you,” the poor man is not with you, but rather, he is with Me.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded because the verse states: “If you lend money to My people [<i>ami</i>], to the poor who is with you.” The word for “My people [<i>ami</i>]” can be vocalized <i>imi</i>, meaning with me. Thus, the verse is stating that the poor, who are “with Me,” should also be with you, in the sense that you should have compassion for them (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Likewise, David said: “For You rescue the poor people” (Psalms 18:28). The attributes of the Holy One blessed be He are not like the attribute of mankind. The attribute of mankind is that if someone is wealthy and he has a poor relative, he does not acknowledge him. He sees his relative and hides from him because he is embarrassed to converse with him because he is poor. Likewise Solomon says: “All the brethren of the poor hate him” (Proverbs 19:7). And he says: “The poor is hated even by his friend” (Proverbs 14:20). Likewise, Job said: “My relatives have departed” (Job 19:14). But if one is wealthy, everyone cleaves to him and loves him, as it is stated: “But the lovers of the wealthy are many” (Proverbs 14:20). But the Holy One blessed be He is not so. Who are His people? The poor. He sees a poor man and cleaves to him. If you would like to know, see what is written: “So said the Lord: The heavens are My throne…” (Isaiah 66:1). What is written thereafter? “But to this I will look, to the poor….” (Isaiah 66:2). Likewise, Moses says to Israel: “Not because you are more numerous…did the Lord desire [you]” (Deuteronomy 7:7), and it is written: “For you are the fewest of all the peoples” (Deuteronomy 7:7). When He becomes reconciled with Zion, upon whom will He have mercy first? It will be upon the poor, as it is stated: “For the Lord has established Zion and in it the poor of His people will be sheltered” (Isaiah 14:32). Likewise, “For the Lord has comforted His people and He will be merciful to His poor” (Isaiah 49:13). That is, “to the poor who is with you.” The poor man is not with you, but rather, he is with Me. That is why it is stated: “For You rescue the poor people” (Psalms 18:28). <br>“You shall not impose usury [<i>neshekh</i>] upon him.” Do not bite [<i>tinshokh</i>] the poor man like the serpent bit Adam the first man and uprooted him and his descendants.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The serpent is described as having bitten Adam because it harmed him by speaking with its mouth (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Likewise, you shall not see that the poor man has houses, fields, vineyards, a slave, or a maidservant and seek ways to take it from him. That is why it is written: “You shall not be a creditor [<i>kenoshe</i>] to him.” Do not bite him [<i>tinshekhenu</i>]; do not be like a serpent that is cunning to do evil. <br>“Do not take from him usury or interest; you shall fear your God” (Leviticus 25:36). Do not say to him: ‘Request of me, I will lend to you,’ and the next day the interest rises, and you take what is his. I ascribe to you as though you injured [<i>ḥavalta</i>] him, as it is stated: “If you take your neighbor’s garment as collateral [<i>ḥavol taḥbol</i>]” (Exodus 22:25). From here you learn that anyone who takes interest from an Israelite does not fear the Omnipresent. This is analogous to one who murdered and they brought him before the governor. When he reads his indictment, he says: ‘Is he still alive?’<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">This criminal should already have been put to death. </i> So too, anyone who takes interest, the verse ascribes to him as though he committed all the evil and the transgressions in the world, as it is stated: “He gave with usury and took interest” (Ezekiel 18:13). The Holy One blessed be He says: ‘Is he still alive? “Shall he live? He shall not live. All these abominations he performed, he shall be put to death, his blood shall be upon him”’ (Ezekiel 18:13). However, one who lends without interest, the Holy One blessed be He considers it for him as though he performed all the mitzvot, as it is stated: “He does not lend his money with usury…. [One who performs these will never stumble]” (Psalms 15:5).
Another matter, “to the poor who is with you,” that is what is written: “But it is God who is the Judge; He humbles this one and elevates that one” (Psalms 75:8). To what is this world similar? To a wheel in a garden. The earthenware vessels in it, the lower ones ascend full and the upper ones descend empty. So too, not everyone who is wealthy today is wealthy tomorrow, and not everyone who is poor today, is poor tomorrow. Why? It is because the world is like a wheel. “For it is due to [<i>biglal</i>] this matter” (Deuteronomy 15:10); Rabbi Aḥa said: The world is a wheel [<i>galgal</i>], as it is stated: “A wise king scatters the wicked, and he turns an <i>ofan</i> upon them.” (Proverbs 20:26). <i>Ofan</i> means nothing other than wheel, as it is stated: “He removed the wheel [<i>ofan</i>] of his chariots” (Exodus 14:25). <br>Happy is anyone whose hand is extended to the poor. See what is written: “Wealthy and poor meet; the Lord is the maker of them all” (Proverbs 22:2). And likewise, “The poor and the deceitful man meet; the Lord enlightens the eyes of both of them” (Proverbs 29:13). The poor man acquired life in this world and the wealthy man acquired life in the World to Come. But the poor man who extends his hand but the homeowner does not want to give to him, “the Lord is the maker of them all.” The One who made this one wealthy is destined to make him poor, and the One who made this one poor is destined to make him wealthy. There is no attribute harsher than poverty, as anyone who is suffering in poverty, it is as though all the suffering in the world adheres to him and as though all the curses in the book of Deuteronomy have come upon him. Our Rabbis said: Had all forms of suffering gathered on one side and poverty on the other side, poverty would tip the scales against all of them. <br>“You shall not be as a creditor to him.” Come and see that anyone who lends with interest violates all the transgressions in the Torah and does not find anyone who will come to his defense. How so? If a person sinned, and violated one of the sins, and stands before the Holy One blessed be He in judgment, the angels stand, these speak in his defense, and those speak against him, as it is stated: “I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of the heavens attending on His right and His left” (II Chronicles 18:18). However, for one who lends to an Israelite with interest, not one of them will speak in his defense, as it is stated: “He gave with usury and took interest, shall he live? He shall not live” (Ezekiel 18:13). Any Israelite who lends another and does not take interest, it is as though he fulfilled all the mitzvot, as David says: “A psalm by David. Lord, who will reside in Your tent? (Psalms 15:1), and it is written: “He does not give his money with usury… (Psalms 15:5).
Another matter, “you shall not be as a creditor to him,” that is what is written: “It is good for a man to be gracious and to lend, conducting his affairs with justice” (Psalms 112:5). Come and see all the creations of the Holy One blessed be He borrow from one another. The day borrows from the night, and the night borrows from the day,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In the summer the day is longer than the night, and is thought of as having borrowed time from the night; in the winter, the opposite is the case. </i> but they do not litigate with each other like people, as it is stated: “Day to day gives utterance; [night to night renders understanding]” (Psalms 19:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The following verse states: “There is no talk, nor are there words; their voice is not heard.”</i> The moon borrows from the stars and the stars borrow from the moon,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">When the moon is full the light of the stars is somewhat obscured; when the moon is very small or not visible, the light of the stars seems brighter. </i> and when the Holy One blessed be He wishes, they do not emerge, as it is stated: “Who says to the sun and it does not shine, and seals the stars” (Job 9:7). The light borrows from the sun and the sun borrows from the light,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash considers there to be a light that brightens the world that is not from the sun. At times it shines for longer before the sun rises and at times it shines for less time before the sun rises (see <i>Yefe Toar</i>). </i> as it is stated: “The sun, the moon stand in their abode, [by the light of Your arrows they will go, at the shining of Your glittering spear]” (Habakkuk 3:11). <br>Wisdom borrows from understanding and understanding borrows from wisdom,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Wisdom refers to knowledge, and understanding refers to the ability to use logic to arrive at new conclusions. Knowledge is not sufficient by itself, and logical reasoning must be based upon knowledge; thus, wisdom and understanding need each other, and are therefore referred to as borrowing from one another. </i> as it is stated: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister, [and call understanding an acquaintance]” (Proverbs 7:4). The heavens borrow from the earth and the earth borrows from the heavens,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Condensation on earth rises to the heavens, where it forms into clouds and then falls back to earth as rain (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> as it is stated: “The Lord will open for you His good storehouse, the heavens” (Deuteronomy 28:12). Kindness borrows from charity and charity borrows from kindness,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Depending on the situation, giving charity to the poor may take precedence over performing kindness for another person, or vice versa (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> as it is stated: “He who pursues righteousness and kindness” (Proverbs 21:21). Torah borrows from mitzvot and mitzvot<i> </i>borrow from Torah, as it is stated: “Observe my mitzvot and live, [and my Torah as the apple of your eye]” (Proverbs 7:2). <br>The creations of the Holy One blessed be He borrow from one another and make peace with each other without words. Yet one man borrows from another and [the creditor] seeks to swallow him with interest and robbery. Those who take interest say to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Why do You not exact payment from Your world, payment for the fact that the creatures are in it, payment for the fact that You water it, payment for the plants that You cause to grow, payment for the lights that You illuminate, payment for the soul that You breathed [into people], payment for the body that You protect?’ The Holy One blessed be He says to them: ‘See how much I have lent, but I do not take interest, and what the earth has lent but does not take interest. Rather, I take the principal that I lent and it takes its own,’<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">God takes back the soul and the earth takes back the body. The Torah states that the human body was created from the earth (see Genesis 2:7). </i> as it is stated: “The dust will return to the earth as it was; and the spirit will return to God who provided it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7). <br>Woe is he who takes interest. What is stated in his regard? “He gave with usury and took interest, shall he live? He shall not live” (Ezekiel 18:13). This is analogous to a king who opened his storehouse for someone. [The man] began tormenting the poor with it, killing widows with it, demeaning the indigent, stripping people and causing them to be naked. He performed villainy and robbery with it, he filled it with deceit, and caused the loss of the king’s storehouse. So too, the Holy One blessed be He opens storehouses and gives His creations from His silver and His gold, as they are His, as it is stated: “Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold” (Haggai 2:8). The poor man begins borrowing from the wealthy man; he takes interest from him. He kills widows with it; if a widow borrows from him, he pressures her and takes interest from her. He demeans the indigent; if they ask him for charity, he is very exacting with them. God says: “One who mocks the poor reviles his Maker” (Proverbs 17:5). He strips the naked with it; if he owes him a <i>maneh</i> or more, he takes his garment from him and he sits there naked and is humiliated. He performs villainy and robbery with it; they hand him their collateral and he consumes them. The Holy One blessed be He says: “Woe is to you who pillages and you were not pillaged” (Isaiah 33:1). The Holy One blessed be He gave him money of truth, and he renders it deceit, as it is stated: “You plowed wickedness, you reaped iniquity” (Hosea 10:13). Therefore, you will pass from the world, as it is stated: “When the storm passes, there are no wicked” (Proverbs 10:25). <br>Therefore the Holy One blessed be He cautions in the Torah: “If you lend money to My people.” If he does not repay you, let it suffice for you that I call him wicked, as it is stated: “The wicked one borrows and does not repay; the righteous one is gracious and gives” (Psalms 37:21). This is the Holy One blessed be He, who cautions Israel and says to them: “If you take your neighbor’s garment as collateral,” return it to him so he does not cry out before Me, as it is stated: “It will be when he cries to Me, [I will hear, as I am gracious]” (Exodus 22:26). Likewise, David says: “Happy is one who attends to the indigent; [the Lord will deliver him in times of trouble]” (Psalms 41:2). Likewise, Solomon says: “Do not rob the impoverished, as he is impoverished” (Proverbs 22:22). Why? “For the Lord will fight their battle and will deprive those who deprive them of life” (Proverbs 22:23).
“You shall not curse judges, [and a prince among your people you shall not revile]” (Exodus 22:27). Rabbi Meir said: Above all, the Holy One blessed be He cautioned regarding the judges of Israel, who teach them justice, and regarding the king, as it is stated: “Do not curse judges, [and a prince among your people you shall not revile].”<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Although it is forbidden to curse anyone, the Torah singles out judges and kings and states that one may not curse them. </i> Likewise you find that Koraḥ and his congregation were punished only because he extended his hand against Moses and Aaron. Likewise, the people of Jerusalem were punished because they demeaned the prophets, as it is stated: “They would insult the messengers of God” (II Chronicles 36:16), and it is written: “They have hardened their faces more than a rock, they refused to repent” (Jeremiah 5:3). That is why the Holy One blessed be He cautioned regarding the honor of the elders and the righteous. <br>Likewise it says: “To understand proverbs and aphorisms, the words of the wise and their riddles” (Proverbs 1:6). Why did He caution in their regard?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Why did God caution that one must be careful to honor the elders and the righteous? </i> It is because they caution Israel against idol worship. That is why it is stated: “And everything that I have said to you, you shall observe, and the name of other gods you shall not mention” (Exodus 23:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The implication is that if all of the commands in the preceding passage are observed, including the command not to curse judges, which is based on the respect due to elders, the people will not come to worship idols. </i> What is written thereafter? “Three times a year” (Exodus 23:17). God established three pilgrimage festivals: the festival of unleavened bread, on which He performed miracles on their behalf in Egypt; the festival of the harvest, on which the Torah was given to Israel, whose fruits they eat in this world, as it is stated: “My fruit is better than gold and fine gold” (Proverbs 8:19); the festival of the ingathering, on which God fills their houses with blessing, as it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth [and with the first fruits of all your produce]” (Proverbs 3:9). That is why it says: “The choicest first fruits of your land [you shall bring to the house of the Lord]” (Exodus 23:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The command regarding the pilgrimage festival appears right after the verse regarding idol worship because traveling to the Temple for the pilgrimage festival will also help to prevent idol worship. Alternatively, it is because one who denigrates the festivals is comparable to one who worships idols (see <i>Pesaḥim</i> 118a). </i>
Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” that is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth” (Proverbs 28:22);<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash will explain how this relates to the verse “if you lend money to My people,” but it first cites other interpretations of the verse. </i> this is Cain, who hastened himself to take the world. How so? When he was with his brother, as it is stated: “It was when they were in the field” (Genesis 4:8), they said one to the other: ‘Come, let us divide the world.’ Cain said: ‘You take the movable property, and I [will take] the land.’ They divided it between them. Abel took the movable property and Cain [took] the land. [Cain] plotted to oust [Abel] from the world. Abel was walking on the earth and Cain was pursuing him. He said to him: ‘Leave what is mine.’ [Abel] went to the mountains, and [Cain] said: ‘Leave what is mine,’ until he stood over him and killed him. That is, “a greedy man rushes after wealth.” This is Cain, who was greedy toward his brother. <br>“And does not know that lack will come upon him” (Proverbs 28:22). What lack befell [Cain]? It is that the Holy One blessed be He said: “Restless and wandering you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). What is that? It is that every place that he went, the Holy One blessed be He would bring trouble along with him and they would strike him and pursue him until they would drive him away. Solomon proclaimed in his regard: “If a man would beget one hundred” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); this is Cain who begot one hundred children, “and would live many years” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); he lived as long as Adam lived, “and the days of his years would be numerous” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); he lived seven hundred and thirty-six years longer than his father, “but his soul will not be sated from the goodness” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); as his soul would not be sated with his money, as it is stated: “Restless and wandering you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). “And moreover, he has no burial” (Ecclesiastes 6:3), as he was in abeyance, gradually weakening until the flood came and swept him away. “I say: A stillborn is better than he” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); this is Abel, his brother, as [Cain] rose up and felled him, [leaving him] dead in the field. <br>Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is Ephron. When Sarah died and Abraham was seeking a place to bury her, he said to them [the Hittites]: “Heed me, and intercede for me with Ephron, son of Tzohar” (Genesis 23:8). Immediately, they went and appointed [Ephron] prefect over them that very day. They said to him: ‘Sell the cave to Abraham.’ He said to them: ‘I will not sell it to him.’ They said to him: ‘If you do not do so we will remove you from your prefecture.’ Immediately, Abraham arose and weighed the silver for him. Rabbi Ḥama said: Every shekel stated in the Torah is a <i>sela</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">When the Torah mentions a shekel it refers to the coin known in the Mishna as a <i>sela</i>.</i> in the Prophets is a<i> litra</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Twenty-five <i>sela</i>.</i> and in the Writings is a <i>centenarium</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">One hundred <i>litra.</i></i> Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: Except for the shekels of Ephron, which were <i>centenaria</i>. What did Ephron say to Abraham? If you give me four hundred shekel, from the merchandise of your house you will give it to me.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">This sum is insignificant to a man as wealthy as you (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>).</i> Because he was greedy regarding Abraham’s money, the verse subtracted a <i>vav</i> from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In the verse that states that Abraham paid the money to Ephron, Ephron’s name is spelled without a <i>vav</i> (Genesis 23:16). This symbolizes the fact that Ephron would experience financial setbacks. </i> That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” The verse subtracted a <i>vav</i> from the person who was greedy. Moreover, the cave was not called by his name, but rather, by the name of the children of Ḥet, as it is stated: “That Abraham purchased from the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 25:10); it does not say from Ephron, but from the children of Ḥet. <br>Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is Esau. When Isaac died, Jacob and Esau came and divided everything. Jacob said: ‘Shall this wicked be destined to enter, he and his children, the Cave of Makhpela, and he will have a portion and residence with the righteous buried in it?’ Immediately, he took all the money in his possession and made it into a pile and said to Esau: ‘My brother, do you want the portion you have in this cave, or this silver and gold?’ At that moment, Esau said: ‘This kind of burial place is found everywhere. For one grave that I have in the cave, will I lose all this money?’ Immediately, he rose and took all the money and gave him his portion. That is what Jacob says to Joseph: “In my grave that I excavated [<i>kariti</i>] for me” (Genesis 50:5). “I purchased,” is not written, but rather <i>kariti</i>. He said to them: ‘I gave Esau a pile [<i>keri</i>] of dinars.’ That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” What is the lack? It is that he did not enter the Cave of Makhpela. <br>Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is the borrower who was too miserly to rent two cows, and he borrows one and rents one. Because he rented only one, if it [the borrowed cow] dies or is injured, he pays. If he rented and it dies, the Torah says: “If he is a renter, it goes for his rent” (Exodus 22:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The owner does not receive payment beyond the rent.</i> That is, “a greedy man rushes after wealth,” as he was too miserly to rent [both cows], the result is “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” That is what is written: “[If a man borrows from his neighbor and it is injured or dies,] its owner is not with it, he shall pay” (Exodus 22:13). <br>Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” Rabbi Levi said: This is one who does not separate his tithes properly. There was an incident involving one who would separate his tithes properly, and he had one field that would produce one thousand measures, and he would separate from it one hundred measures as tithe. From the remainder, he and the members of his household supported themselves. At the time of his death, he called his son and said: ‘My son, pay attention to this field, such and such measures it produces, such and such measures for tithe, and from it I supported myself all my days.’ When he passed from the world, the first year, the son sowed it, and it produced one thousand measures and he separated from it one hundred as tithe. The second year, miserliness overcame him and he deducted ten,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">He separated only ninety measures as tithe.</i> and it deducted one hundred;<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The next year, the field produced only nine hundred measures.</i> likewise the third, likewise, the fourth, likewise, the fifth, until it reached the total of its tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Each year, he deducted ten measures from the tithe and the field produced one hundred measures fewer, until ultimately, the field produced only one hundred measures.</i> When his relatives saw that it was so, they rose, donned white garments and wrapped themselves in white outer garments and came to him. He said to them: ‘Have you come to rejoice over my [troubles]?’ They said: ‘Heaven forbid, we came only to rejoice with you.’ In the past, you were the landowner and the Holy One blessed be He was the priest. Now, you have become the priest and the Holy One blessed be He has become the landowner. That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” <br>Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is one who would lend with interest, because he was too miserly to lend to Israelites without interest. “And does not know that lack will come upon him,” as it is written: “He who increases his wealth through usury and interest amasses it for one who cares for the poor” (Proverbs 28:8). Who is “one who cares for the poor”? This is Esau. Is Esau one who cares for the poor? Is he not one who exploits the poor? Rather, he was like generals, commanders, and governors who invade cities, rob, and plunder, and when they return they say: ‘Bring us the poor and we will support them.’ The folk proverb says: She prostitutes herself for apples and distributes them to the ill. <br>Another matter, what is: “Amasses it for one who cares for the poor”? Everything that the Babylonian kingdom gathers in this world, the Holy One blessed be He gives it to Israel in the future, as it is stated: “Its merchandise and its fee will be sacred to the Lord” (Isaiah 23:18). <br>Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you lend money and do not take interest from him, you are My people. Just as I will never stumble, so, too, you will never stumble,’ as it is stated: “He does not lend with usury” (Psalms 15:5) and it is written: “One who performs these will never stumble” (Psalms 15:5).

Chapter 32

<b>“Behold, I am sending an angel before you to protect you along the way and to take you to the place that I have prepared” (Exodus 23:20).</b> <br>“Behold, I am sending an angel” – that is what is written: “I had said: You are divine beings” (Psalms 82:6). Had Israel waited for Moses and not performed that act,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the Golden Calf. </i> there would have been no exiles, and the angel of death would not have had dominion over them. Likewise it says, “[The tablets were the work of God] and the script was the script of God, engraved [<i>ḥarut</i>] on the tablets” (Exodus 32:16). What is <i>ḥarut</i>? Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: Rabbi Yehuda said: Freedom [<i>ḥerut</i>] from exiles. Rabbi Neḥemya said: Freedom from the angel of death. When Israel said: “Everything that the Lord spoke, we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), the Holy One blessed be He said: Adam the first man, I commanded one mitzva for him so that he would fulfill it, and I likened him to the ministering angels, as it is stated: “Behold, the man has become like one of us” (Genesis 3:22); these, who perform and fulfill the six hundred and thirteen mitzvot besides the generalizations, the specificities, and the details, is it not logical that they live and endure forever? <br>Likewise it says: “And from Matana to Naḥaliel” (Numbers 21:19)<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Matana and Naḥaliel are generally understood as the names of places, but the midrash is interpreting the verse to mean that through the gift [<i>matana</i>] of the Torah, Israel received from God [<i>naḥalu El</i>] eternal life. </i> – they received it from the Holy One blessed be He so they would be alive and enduring forever. When they said: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:8), death came upon them. The Holy One blessed be He said: You followed the approach of Adam the first man who did not withstand his ordeal for three hours, and at nine hours he was sentenced to death.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The text in <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> (29:1) states that Adam was commanded in the ninth hour, he sinned in the tenth hour, and his punishment was pronounced in the eleventh hour (see Maharzu). </i> “I had said: You are divine beings,” but you followed the attribute of Adam the first man; “indeed, as men you will die” (Psalms 82:7). What is: “As one of the princes you will fall” (Psalms 82:7)? Rabbi Yehuda said: Either like Adam or like Eve.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Each received the punishment that was appropriate for him or for her.</i> <br>Another matter: “As one of the princes you will fall” – Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen ben Rabbi Ḥama said: The Holy One blessed be He said to them: You have toppled yourselves. In the past, you were served by means of the Divine Spirit; now, you are served only by means of an angel. That is, “behold, I am sending an angel before you.”
Another matter: “Behold, I am sending an angel before you” – that is what is written: “And I said: How shall I place you [<i>ashitekh</i>] among the children” (Jeremiah 3:19). What is <i>ashitekh</i>? The Holy One blessed be He said: From the moment that you stood at Sinai and received the Torah, and I wrote that I love you, as it is stated: “But because of the Lord’s love for you” (Deuteronomy 7:8) – after I loved you, how can I hate you? “How shall I place you [<i>ashitekh</i>]<i> </i>among the children?” <i>Ashitekh </i>indicates nothing other than animosity, as it is stated: “I will place [<i>ashit</i>] animosity” (Genesis 3:15). <br>Another matter: “How shall I place you [<i>ashitekh</i>] among the children?” (Jeremiah 3:19) – Rabbi Yehoshua said: You have obligated yourselves, as it is written: “In accordance with all that shall be imposed [<i>yushat</i>] upon him” (Exodus 21:30). Rabbi Berekhya said: You have laid waste to yourselves, as it is written: “Briers and thistles [<i>shayit</i>]” (Isaiah 5:6). “I gave you a desirable [<i>ḥemda</i>] land” – why is it called desirable? Because the Temple is located in it; that is what is written: “The mountain that God desired [<i>ḥamad</i>] for His abode” (Psalms 68:17). <br>Another matter: “A desirable land” (Jeremiah 3:19) – for all the kings desired it, as between Ai and Jericho is only three <i>mil</i>, and this one had a king and that one had a king. <br>Another matter: “A desirable [<i>ḥemda</i>] land” (Jeremiah 3:19) – the Rabbis say: A land that was made desirable for the patriarchs of the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God made it desirable to Abraham and Isaac by commanding them to live there and by promising them the land. They fulfilled these commands, thereby indicating how desirable it was to them. </i> Abraham, as it is stated: “Go from your land…[to the land that I will show you]” (Genesis 12:1). Isaac – “reside in this land” (Genesis 26:3). Jacob – “you shall transport me from Egypt” (Genesis 47:30). Why did it become desirable for them?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Why was it desirable to them to be in the Land of Israel even after death, as in the case of Jacob? (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Because [those who are buried there] come to life first in the messianic era. <br>What is “a magnificent inheritance [<i>naḥalat tzevi</i>]” (Jeremiah 3:19)? Why is it analogized to a gazelle [<i>tzevi</i>]? Just as the gazelle, when a person flays it, its hide cannot contain its flesh, so too, when Israel took possession of it, the Land of Israel could not contain its produce. <br>Another matter: Just as the gazelle is easy to eat,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">They do not require raising and herding.</i> so too, the produce of the Land of Israel is easy to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">When the people of Israel are deserving, the land produces great bounty without requiring hard work. </i> The Rabbis say: Just as the gazelle, its legs are fleeter than any animal and any beast, so, the Land of Israel is faster to ripen its produce than all the lands. Why to that extent? The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘So that My name will be uniquely associated with you.’ <br>“I said: You shall call Me my Father, and do not turn back from following Me” (Jeremiah 3:19), but you did not do so, but rather, “indeed, a woman has betrayed her lover” (Jeremiah 3:20). The Rabbis say: It is not written here, “her husband,” but rather, “her lover.” Just as a woman cannot rebel against her husband, but she can reject her lover – why, because there is no marriage contract between them – so the Holy One blessed be He says to Israel: ‘You did not render Me a husband but rather a lover; just as a woman betrays her lover, so “you have betrayed Me, house of Israel”’ (Jeremiah 3:20). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: If only [they were] like a woman to her lover. For as long as he gives her a wage, she obeys him; if he stops giving her wage, she says to him: ‘Was I not subservient to you only for the wage?’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Have I withheld anything from you such that you have rejected Me?’ That is, “a woman has betrayed her lover.” <br>Another matter: “Behold, I am sending an angel” – the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: Had you merited, I, Myself, would have become a messenger for you just as I did for you in the wilderness, as it is stated: “The Lord was going before them by day” (Exodus 13:21). Now that you did not merit, I am passing you to a messenger, as it is stated: “Behold, I am sending an angel.”
When were they passed to a messenger? It was when they engaged in idol worship. From where is it derived? For this is what the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Go, lead the people…[behold, My angel will go before you]” (Exodus 32:34).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This verse was stated in the aftermath of the sin of the Golden Calf. </i> Moses said: “If Your presence does not go, do not take us up from here” (Exodus 33:15). Moreover, Moses said to the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, what is the difference between us and the idolaters? We have prophets and they have prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on Exodus 33:16, where Moses continues to plead that God Himself lead Israel, arguing that if He does not do so there will be no difference between Israel and other nations. </i> We have a guardian angel and they have a guardian angel. Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He abolished two good benefits from the idolaters such that prophets would not arise for them and that Israel would not be passed to a guardian angel all the days of Moses. When Moses died, that guardian angel returned to his place, for Joshua saw him, as it is stated: “It was when Joshua was in Jericho.… He said: No, for I am commander of the host of the Lord; now I have come” (Joshua 5:13–14). That is why it is stated: “Behold, I am sending an angel before you.”
<b>“Beware of him and heed his voice; do not defy him, for he will not pardon your transgression, for My name is in him” (Exodus 23:21).</b> <br>“Beware of him” – the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: Beware of the messenger, as he does not renege on My mission; he is the attribute of justice. “Do not defy him” – regarding the past it says: “You have been defiant with the Lord” (Deuteronomy 9:7), and I would accept it from you. But now, “do not defy him, for he will not pardon your transgression.” <br>Another matter: “Do not defy [<i>tamer</i>] him” – do not substitute him for Me and do not render Me his substitute [<i>temurato</i>]. Perhaps you will say: Since he is our guardian angel, it is him that we worship, and he will forgive our sins. No, “for he will not pardon your transgression,” unlike Me, as it is written in My regard: “Pardoning iniquity, and overlooking transgression” (Micah 7:18), but “he will not pardon your transgression.” Moreover, you will cause My name to be removed from within him, as it is stated: “For My name is in him.” <br>Another matter: “For My name is in him” – because ministering angels are sustained only from the aura of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “You sustain [<i>meḥayeh</i>] them all, [and the host of the heavens prostrates itself to You]” (Nehemiah 9:6). What is that?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Why does the verse use the term <i>meḥayeh</i>, which is generally interpreted to mean “bring to life,” given that angels do not die such that they would need to be brought back to life? (Maharzu).</i> Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: You are the life force [<i>miḥya</i>] for them all. Moreover, he incurs liability by their means.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If the angel is worshipped, the worshippers will cause the angel himself to be punished (Maharzu). </i> “For if you heed his voice and perform all that I will say” (Exodus 23:22) – it is not written here, “he will say,” but rather, “I will say.” If you accept it from him it will be as though you are accepting it from Me. If you do so: “I will be an enemy to your enemies” (Exodus 23:22); that is, “behold, I am sending an angel” (Exodus 23:20).
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “And I said: How shall I place you among the children.… Indeed, a woman has betrayed her lover” (Jeremiah 3:19–20). “And I said: How shall I place you among the children” – all the miracles and mighty acts that I performed on your behalf were not so you would give Me My reward, but rather, so you would respect Me like children and call Me your Father. “I said: You shall call Me my Father” (Jeremiah 3:19) – what miracles did I perform for any creature more than you, as you would walk after Me and I would walk before you and illuminate for you, as it is stated: “The Lord was going before them by day [in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to illuminate for them]” (Exodus 13:21). <br>“I said: You shall call Me my Father” (Jeremiah 3:19), but you, what did you do? “Indeed, a woman has betrayed her lover” (Jeremiah 3:20) – it is not written here, “her husband,” but rather, “her lover.” Why? It is because a man who takes a wife and spends many days with her, even if he becomes poor, his wife does not reject him; rather, she says: When he was wealthy, he fed me and clothed me, and now that he has become poor, I do not reject him. But when she is a prostitute,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The prostitute is with a man only because he pays her and not because they share a marriage relationship. </i> if he gives to her she thanks him, if he does not give to her, she does not acknowledge him. That is why it is stated: “Indeed, a woman has betrayed her lover.” <br>Another matter: When a prostitute has a lover and he honors her with an object, she shows it to her friends and says: See how much my lover has honored me. But you, house of Israel, did not do so. Rather, I performed miracles and mighty acts on your behalf, as the clouds of glory were surrounding you, the manna was falling, the spring of water was rising, and the quail was available, but you did not laud Me, and you were not like a prostitute who lauds the fee <see Ezekiel 16:31>, as it is stated: “They did not say: Where is the Lord, who takes us up from the land of Egypt” (Jeremiah 2:6). I, too, “for I will not ascend in your midst” (Exodus 33:3), but rather, “behold, I am sending an angel” (Exodus 23:30).
Another matter: “Behold, I am sending an angel” (Exodus 23:30) – that is what is written: “The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and rescues them” (Psalms 34:8). If a person performs one mitzva, the Holy One blessed be He provides him with one angel to protect him, as it is stated: “The angel of the Lord encamps.” If he performs two mitzvot, the Holy One blessed be He provides him with two angels to protect him, as it is stated: “For He will command His angels on your behalf to protect you in all your ways” (Psalms 91:11). If he performs many mitzvot, the Holy One blessed be He will provide him with half His camp, as it is stated: “A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand” (Psalms 91:7), and that is half His camp, as it is stated: “The chariots of God are myriad [<i>ribotayim</i>], thousands of companies” (Psalms 68:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>ribotayim</i> literally means tens of thousands. Due to the general rule that plural terms indicate two, as nothing more than that can be conclusively proven from the plural usage, tens of thousands and thousands would mean twenty-two thousand, half of which is eleven thousand. </i>
Another matter: “Behold, I am sending an angel” (Exodus 23:30) – that is what is written: “I had said: You are divine beings, celestial beings, all of you” (Psalms 82:6). When the children of Israel stood at Sinai and received the Torah, the Holy One blessed be He said to the angel of death, ‘You have license against all the idolaters, but you have no license against this nation, as they are My portion. Just as I live and endure, so My children endure,’ as it is stated: “When the Most High bequeathed to the nations” (Deuteronomy 32:8), and it is written: “For His people is the portion of the Lord, Jacob the allotment of His inheritance” (Deuteronomy 32:9). But you did not want it, and you corrupted your actions and said to the Calf: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:8). Therefore, “indeed, as men you will die [and as one of the minsters [<i>sarim</i>] you will fall]” (Psalms 82:7) – just as idolaters utilize guardian angels [<i>sarim</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">They are under the auspices of angels. God does not provide for them directly but rather through angels. Similarly, they are susceptible to the angel of death. </i> so do you, as it is stated: “Behold, I am sending an angel.” <br>Likewise, you find that the Holy One blessed be He showed Jacob the guardian angels of each and every kingdom, as it is stated: “He dreamed, and behold, a ladder set on the earth” (Genesis 28:12). He showed him several nations, several officials, and several governors rising from each and every kingdom. Just as he showed them to him rising, he showed them to him falling, as it is stated: “And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending upon it” (Genesis 28:12). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You, too, ascend.’ Jacob said to Him: ‘I fear that I, too, will descend just as they descended.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Fear not, just as I do not descend from My greatness, so too, neither you nor your descendants will descend from their greatness,’ as it is stated: “Behold, the Lord was standing over him” (Genesis 28:13). ‘When? It is when they perform My will. But when they said: “This is your god, Israel,” and you forsook Me and followed the ways of the idolaters, just as idolaters utilize guardian angels, so you will [utilize] guardian angels,’ as it is stated: “behold, I am sending an angel” (Exodus 23:30).
Moses said to Him: ‘Are You sending an angel with me? Were those the terms? Did You not say: “I have descended to rescue it from the hand of Egypt and to bring it up from that land [to a good and expansive land]” (Exodus 3:8), and now You say: “Behold, I am sending an angel before you” (Exodus 23:30)? “If Your presence does not go, do not take us up from here”’ (Exodus 33:15). [God] said to him: “For I will not ascend in your midst” (Exodus 33:3). Moses said: ‘You said angel, and I say: “If Your presence does not go,” let us see whose words will stand’; that is what is written: “Moses said to the Lord: See, You say to me: [Take this people up, but You did not inform me whom You will send with me]” (Exodus 33:12). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, “My Presence will go, and I will give you rest”’ (Exodus 33:14). The Divine Spirit cries out: “Since the king's rule is in his word, [who will say to him: What are you doing?] One who observes a mitzva will know no evil matter” (Ecclesiastes 8:4–5).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash applies the verse in Ecclesiastes to mean that someone of Moses’s stature had the ability to annul the divine decree. </i>
“Behold, I am sending an angel” (Exodus 23:30) – the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: The one who protected the patriarchs will protect the descendants. Likewise, you find with Abraham, when he blessed his son Isaac, he said to him: “The Lord, God of the heavens…He will send His angel before you” (Genesis 24:7). Jacob our patriarch, what did he say to his children? “The angel who redeems me [from all evil]” (Genesis 48:16). He said to them: ‘He redeemed me from Esau, he redeemed me from Laban, he fed me and supported me during the years of famine.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Now, too, the one who protected the patriarchs will protect the descendants, as it is stated: “Behold, I am [sending an angel].”’ <br>Every place that an angel is seen, the Divine Presence is seen, as it is stated: “An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire” (Exodus 3:2), and immediately, “God called to him” (Exodus 3:4). Moreover, when Israel cries out before Him, salvation will come to them. So it was at the bush, as it is stated: “Now, behold, the outcry of the children of Israel has come to Me” (Exodus 3:9). Likewise with Gideon, “An angel [of the Lord] came.… The angel of the Lord appeared to him…” (Judges 6:11–12).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Following this, in verse 13, Gideon complains to the angel about Israel’s oppression at the hands of Midian. The midrash will now cite the angel’s response to Gideon. </i> “He said: Go with this strength of yours and save Israel” (Judges 6:14). Likewise, in the future, when he will reveal himself, redemption will come to Israel, as it is stated: “Behold, I am sending My messenger, and he will clear a way before Me” (Malachi 3:1). <br>

Chapter 33

<b>“Speak to the children of Israel, and they shall take Me a gift; from every man whose heart pledges, you shall collect My gift” (Exodus 25:2).</b> <br>“They shall take Me a gift” – that is what is written: “For a good lesson [<i>lekaḥ</i>] I have given you: My Torah, do not forsake it” (Proverbs 4:2). Do not forsake the acquisition [<i>mikaḥ</i>] that I gave to you. You have a person who acquires an acquisition, there is gold in it but there is no silver in it, there is silver in it but there is no gold in it. But the acquisition that I gave you, there is silver in it, as it is stated: “The sayings of the Lord are pure sayings, like silver purified” (Psalms 12:7), and there is gold in it, as it is stated: “They are more desirable than gold, than quantities of fine gold” (Psalms 19:11). <br>There is a person who acquires fields but not orchards, orchards but not fields; but this acquisition, there are fields in it and there are orchards in it, as it is stated: “Your irrigated fields are an orchard of pomegranates” (Song of Songs 4:13). <br>You have a person who acquires an acquisition, but people do not know what it is. However, from the fee of the intermediary it is known what he acquired. So too, the Torah, people know what it is only from the reward that Moses received, as it is stated: “Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant as He spoke with him” (Exodus 34:29). <br>You have an acquisition that the one who sold it is sold with it. The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: I sold you the Torah; as it were, I was sold with it, as it is stated: “And they shall take Me a gift.”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is usually understood to mean “they shall take for Me as a gift,” but the midrash understands it to mean “they shall take Me as a gift.” </i> This is analogous to a king who had an only daughter. One of the kings came and took her [as a wife], and sought to go to his land and take his wife [with him]. He said to him: ‘My daughter whom I gave to you is an only child. To part from her, I am unable; to say to you do not take her, I am unable, because she is your wife. Rather, do this favor for me; wherever you go, prepare a small bedroom for me, so I can live with you, as I cannot forsake my daughter.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘I gave you the Torah. To leave it, I am unable. To say to you do not take it, I am unable. Rather, every place you go, build a house for Me so I may reside in it,’ as it is stated: “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me, [and I will dwell among them]” (Exodus 25:8).
Another matter: “They shall take Me a gift” – that is what is written: “You ascended on high; you took captives; [you acquired gifts among men; even the deviant, for the Lord God to dwell there]” (Psalms 68:19);<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although this verse is generally interpreted as being addressed to God, the midrash here interprets it as being addressed to Moses. </i> all your greatness was only from On High. “You ascended On High” – “Moses ascended to God” (Exodus 19:3), “and Moses approached the thick cloud” (Exodus 20:18). “You took captives” – a king, when his armies are taken captive, he is troubled. Would you say the same is true here? The verse states: “You acquired” (Psalms 68:19) – when a person sells, he is distressed. The verse states: “Gifts among men” (Psalms 68:19) – this is what He said to them: ‘I ascribe in your regard as though I gave it to you as a gift.’<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, although the verse describes Moses as though he did battle with the angels and took the Torah by force, as one takes a captive, or acquired it as in an acquisition, and a person who had lost something important in one of these ways would be distressed, God is described as happy with Moses bringing the Torah to earth. </i> <br>“Even the deviant” (Psalms 68:19) – the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘What are the idolaters saying? That I will not return to be with [Israel] because they engaged in idol worship, as it is stated: “They have quickly deviated” (Deuteronomy 9:12). Even if they are deviant, I will not forsake them, and I will reside with them,’ as it is stated: “Even the deviant, for the Lord God to dwell” (Psalms 68:19).
Another matter: “They shall take Me a gift” – that is what is written: “I am asleep, but my heart is awake” (Song of Songs 5:2). The congregation of Israel said: I went to sleep regarding the end of days, but the Holy One blessed be He is awake, as it is stated: “God is the Rock of my heart and my portion forever” (Psalms 73:26).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The congregation of Israel is saying: Due to the length and difficulty of the exile I diverted my attention from hoping for redemption, but God is still awaiting my redemption (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> “I am asleep” from the mitzvot, but the merit of my patriarchs stands for me, and “my heart is awake.” I am asleep” due to the act of the Calf, “but my heart is awake,” and the Holy One blessed be He cleaves to me; that is, “they shall take Me a gift.” Open for me, my sister, my love” (Song of Songs 5:2) – until when will I be proceeding without a house, “for my head is filled with dew” (Song of Songs 5:2). Rather, “craft a sanctuary for Me” (Exodus 25:8), so I will not be outside.
Another matter: “They shall take Me a gift” – Rabbi Berekhya began: “Yours, Lord, is the greatness, and the might…for everything that is in the heavens and on the earth” (I Chronicles 29:11). You find that everything the Holy One blessed be He created above, He created below. Above, an abode and thick cloud, as it is stated: “See from the abode of Your holiness” (Isaiah 63:15). Thick cloud, [as it is stated]: “Moses approached the thick cloud [where God was]” (Exodus 20:18), and it is written: “Can He judge through the thick cloud?” (Job 22:13). Below, “then Solomon said: The Lord said that He would dwell in the thick cloud” (I Kings 8:12), and it is written: “I have built a house as an abode for You” (I Kings 8:13). <br>Above, “seraphim were standing above Him” (Isaiah 6:2); below, “standing acacia wood” (Exodus 26:15). Above, cherubs, as it is stated: “who abides upon the cherubs” (Isaiah 37:16); below, “the cherubs shall be” (Exodus 25:20). Above, “the wheels were borne parallel to them” (Ezekiel 1:20); below, “The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of the chariot’s wheel” (I Kings 7:33), and likewise, “and behold, there was one wheel on the ground” (Ezekiel 1:15). Above, “the Lord is in His Holy Sanctuary” (Psalms 11:4); below, “the Sanctuary of the Lord” (I Samuel 1:9). Above, “The kings of hosts flee again and again” (Psalms 68:13); below, “the hosts of the Lord departed” (Exodus 12:41). Above, “let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, [and let it divide between water and water]” (Genesis 1:6); below, “the curtain shall divide for you [between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies]” (Exodus 26:33). Above, “the throne of the Lord” (I Chronicles 29:23); below, “Throne of glory, exalted from the first, is the place of our Temple” (Jeremiah 17:12). Above, “Is there a number to His companies” (Job 25:3); below, “two men, captains of his companies” (II Samuel 4:2). Above, “And count the stars” (Genesis 15:5); below, “and, behold, you are today as the stars of the heavens in abundance” (Deuteronomy 1:10). <br>Above, “Behold the man garbed in linen” (Ezekiel 9:11); below, “He shall don a sacred linen tunic” (Leviticus 16:4). Above, “The angel [<i>malakh</i>] of the Lord encamps” (Psalms 34:8); below, “as he is a messenger [<i>malakh</i>] of the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 2:7). Above, “he took it from upon the altar with tongs” (Isaiah 6:6); below, “You shall make for Me an altar of earth” (Exodus 20:21). Above, “and stretches them like a tent for dwelling” (Isaiah 40:22); below, “how goodly are your tents, Jacob” (Numbers 24:5). Above, “He spreads out the heavens like a sheet” (Psalms 104:2); below, “ten sheets” (Exodus 26:1). Above, “light rests with Him” (Daniel 2:22); below, “pure olive oil pressed for illumination” (Exodus 27:20). Moreover, everything that is below is more beloved that what is above. Know that He forsook what was above and descended to what was below, as it is stated: “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me, and I will dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8). That is, “for everything that is in the heavens and on the earth” (I Chronicles 29:11), and it says: “Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, the utterance of the Lord of hosts” (Haggai 2:8).
Another matter: “They shall take Me a gift” – that is what is written: “A name is preferable [<i>nivḥar</i>] to great wealth” (Proverbs 22:1). The name of Moses is preferable, as it is stated: “Were it not for Moses His chosen one [<i>beḥiro</i>]” (Psalms 106:23), and likewise it says: “I have known you by name” (Exodus 33:17) – to Koraḥ’s wealth, as it is stated: “Two hundred and fifty firepans” (Numbers 16:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The implication of the verse is that all two hundred fifty gold firepans were provided by Koraḥ himself, which is an indication of his great wealth (Maharzu). </i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Because you have wealth you are haughty? The name of Moses is preferable to all your wealth of silver and gold. That is, “and good grace to silver and gold” (Proverbs 22:1). <br>Another matter: The name of Pinḥas is preferable to the wealth of Zimri, who was the prince of the tribe of Simeon. What did Zimri do? In his regard, Solomon said: “A wicked man is insolent” (Proverbs 21:29). “And the upright, he discerns his way” (Proverbs 21:29) – this is Pinḥas. In what way was Zimri insolent? It was, that when Kozbi came, he sought to take her. She said to him: ‘I will not submit to you, as my father commanded me that I should submit only to Moses.’ He said to her: ‘I am greater than Moses, as he is from the third tribe<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Levi, Jacob’s third-born</i> and I am from the second tribe.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Simeon, Jacob’s second-born</i> Do you want to know that I am greater than Moses? I will take you in his presence,’ as it is stated: “And, behold, a man from the children of Israel came and brought the Midianite woman near to his brethren, before the eyes of Moses” (Numbers 25:6), as he was flinging words against [Moses]. He said to him: ‘Moses, is this one forbidden or permitted?’ He said to him: ‘She is forbidden to you.’ Zimri said to him: ‘Are you the one who is most faithful to the Torah, such that the Holy One blessed be He takes pride in you and says: “Not so My servant Moses; [in all My house he is faithful]” (Numbers 12:7)? If you say that this one is forbidden, then the wife that you took is forbidden to you. This one is Midianite and that one is Midianite. This one is the most prominent of her patrilineal family, and your wife is the daughter of a priest.’ That is, “before the eyes of Moses.” Solomon cries out: “A wicked man is insolent.” When they saw him<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">When the Israelite elders saw Zimri’s insolent attack on Moses. </i> they were weeping, as it is stated: “And they were weeping” (Numbers 25:6). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Moses, are you weeping? Where is your wisdom that you said something and you caused Koraḥ to be swallowed, and now you are weeping?’ The Divine Spirit calls out: “The stout-hearted ran rampant. They fell into a stupor” (Psalms 76:6). Moses said to Him: “There is no wisdom, no understanding, and no counsel against the Lord” (Proverbs 21:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Zimri’s attack is purely against the Lord. Therefore, human wisdom is irrelevant, and it is God who should punish Zimri (<i>Yefe To’ar</i>). </i> <br>The Holy One blessed be He said: I know who is prepared for this matter. What is written thereafter? “A horse is ready for the day of battle, but salvation is for the Lord” (Proverbs 21:31). Rabbi Yosei said: Pinḥas himself expounded: If a horse that gives its life on a day of war, even if it dies, it gives its life for its owner, I, for the sanctity of the name of the Holy One blessed be He, all the more so. “Pinḥas son of Elazar saw” (Numbers 25:7) – he began saying to himself: What will I do? Two can prevail over one; can one, perhaps, prevail over two? While he was deliberating to himself, the plague was afflicting and the Holy One blessed be He was saying: “You faltered on a day of trouble” (Proverbs 24:10), “Deliver those taken to death” (Proverbs 24:11). “If you say: Behold, we did not know this” (Proverbs 24:12), I will attest in your regard, as it is stated: “Is He not the assessor of hearts, He understands” (Proverbs 24:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">God said to Pinḥas: If you are concerned that people will suspect your motives, I will attest that your motives were pure (Rabbi David Luria). </i> <br>Pinḥas entered, and he found that the Holy One blessed be He had secured them one to the other; they were intertwined one with the other, and they were unable to separate themselves. And he stabbed them in the place of their attachment, as it is stated: “He stabbed the two of them” (Numbers 25:8). When he exited, the tribe of Zimri entered. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He smote them all with the plague. When Pinḥas saw the plague, he was standing and praying, as it is stated: “Pinḥas stood and he prayed” (Psalms 106:30). Immediately the Holy One blessed be He summoned Moses and said to him: ‘Come and I will inform you who preserved the descendants of Abraham,’ as it is stated: “Pinḥas son of Elazar [the son of Aaron the priest has turned My wrath away from the children of Israel]” (Numbers 25:11). That is why it is stated: “A name is preferable to great wealth” (Proverbs 22:1). <br>Another matter: The name of Mordekhai is preferable to the wealth of Haman. Rabbi Yoshiya said: What did that wicked one do? He took out all the silver and gold that he had and he gave it to Aḥashverosh. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘By your life, “good grace [<i>ḥen</i>] is preferable to silver and gold”’ (Proverbs 22:1). The grace of Esther, as it is stated: “Esther found favor [<i>ḥen</i>]” (Esther 2:15), is preferable. When the wicked one came with the money, the king said to him: “The money is given to you” (Esther 3:11). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Is this how you are selling Mine for what is Mine?’ As it is stated: “For the children of Israel are slaves to Me” (Leviticus 25:55), and it is written: “The silver and the gold are Mine” (Haggai 2:8). ‘As you live, what you said: “The money is given to you…,” so, “on that day, King Aḥashverosh gave the house of Haman to Queen Esther”’ (Esther 8:1).
Another matter: “They shall take Me a gift” – that is what is written: “For a good lesson [<i>lekaḥ</i>] I have given you (Proverbs 4:2). Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen ben Rabbi<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When the term Rabbi is used without mention of which rabbi, it is generally a reference to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. That cannot be the case here, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was not a priest. The meaning of “ben Rabbi [<i>berabbi</i>]” may be that Rabbi Berekhya was a student of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. Alternatively, the term <i>berabbi</i> may be used similarly to the term <i>beribi</i>, which means, “the esteemed.” </i> said: The way of the world is that when a person sells an object from his house, he is sad over it. But the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah to Israel and is joyful; that is, “a good acquisition [<i>lekaḥ</i>].” The way of the world is that when a person acquires an object he exerts himself to protect it, but the Torah protects its owners, as it is stated: “When you walk it will guide you; [when you lie down, it will protect you]” (Proverbs 6:22). The way of the world is that when a person acquires an object from the marketplace, can he perhaps acquire its owner? But the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah to Israel and says to them, as it were: It is I that you are acquiring. That is, “they shall take Me a gift.”
Another matter: “They shall take Me a gift” – that is what is written: “Moses commanded us the Torah” (Deuteronomy 33:4). Rabbi Simlai expounded: Six hundred and thirteen mitzvot were given to Israel through Moses, as that is the numerical value of Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tav</i> is four hundred, <i>vav</i> is six, <i>resh</i> is two hundred, and <i>heh</i> is five, for a total of six hundred and eleven, as the midrash is about to note. </i> If you say it is only six hundred and eleven, and where are the other two; the Rabbis say: “I am [the Lord your God]” (Exodus 20:2) and, “You shall have no [other gods]” (Exodus 20:3) they heard from the mouth of the Almighty, and Moses told them six hundred and eleven, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us the Torah, a heritage…” (Deuteronomy 33:4). Do not read “a heritage [<i>morasha</i>],” but an inheritance [<i>yerusha</i>]; it is an eternal inheritance for Israel. This is analogous to the son of kings who was taken captive overseas when he was young. Even after several years, he is not shy, because he says: I am returning to the inheritance of my ancestors. So too, a Torah scholar who leaves the Torah and engages in other matters, even after several years, if he seeks to return he is not shy, because he says: I am returning to the inheritance of my ancestors. <br>Another matter: “Heritage” – do not read it “heritage [<i>morasha</i>],” but rather, betrothed [<i>me’orasa</i>]. Just as a groom, as long as he has not married his betrothed he is a frequent visitor to his father-in-law’s house; once he marries her, her father comes to her. So too, until the Torah was given to Israel, “Moses ascended to God” (Exodus 19:3). Once the Torah was given, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me, and I will dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8). <br>Another matter: Do not read it “heritage [<i>morasha</i>],” but rather, betrothed [<i>me’orasa</i>]; this teaches that the Torah is betrothed to Israel, as it is stated: “I will betroth you to Me forever” (Hosea 2:21). From where is it derived that it is like a married woman for the idolaters?<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Since the Torah is compared to a woman who is betrothed to Israel, if other nations study it they are compared to one who commits adultery with a married woman. From where is it derived that they are punished as adulterers? </i> As it is stated: “Can a man stoke fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? If a man walks on hot coals, will his feet not be scalded? So is one who consorts with another’s wife” (Proverbs 6:27–29).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The verse compares one who commits adultery to one who touches fire. Since Torah is compared to fire (see Jeremiah 23:29), the comparison indicates that non-Jews who engage in Torah study are considered as though they commit adultery (<i>Midrash HaMevo’ar</i>). </i>
Another matter: “They shall take Me a gift” – when the Holy One blessed be He told Moses about the matters pertaining to the Tabernacle, he said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, is Israel capable of crafting it?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Even one member of Israel is capable of crafting it,’ as it is stated: “From each man whose heart moves him” (Exodus 25:2). The Rabbis said: Jewels and pearls would fall amidst the manna that was falling for Israel, and the prominent among them would come, gather them, and store them. Know that it is so, as it is stated: “They brought him more gifts morning after morning” (Exodus 36:3). Did they bring in the morning, but in the afternoon they did not bring? It is rather that they brought from what the manna would bring down for them. Likewise, it says: “The princes [<i>nesiim</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Another meaning of the word <i>nesiim </i>is clouds (see <i>Yoma</i> 75b). Thus, the implication is that these stones fell from the clouds along with the manna.</i> brought [the onyx stones and the stones for setting]” (Exodus 35:27). <br><b>“This is the gift that you shall collect from them: gold, silver, and bronze” (Exodus 25:3)</b> <br>“This is the gift” (Exodus 25:3) – Rabbi Tavyomei said: When the time arrived for Jacob our patriarch to depart from the world, he called his sons and said to them: ‘Know that the Holy One blessed be He is destined to say to your descendants to craft a Tabernacle; however, all its needs must be ready in their possession,’ as it is stated: “And God will be with you” (Genesis 48:21). Does it enter your mind that when Jacob our patriarch was alive the Holy One blessed be He was not with his sons? Rather, so he said to them: ‘He is destined to say to you: “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me” (Exodus 25:8), and He will descend and rest His presence in your midst, as it is stated: “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me, and I will dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8).’ Some prepared items for themselves and some forgot. When Moses came and they crafted the Tabernacle, some brought from their own, and some brought only from what was already in their possession, as it says: “And every man with whom was found sky-blue, purple, [and scarlet wool” (Exodus 35:23), and it says: “And every man with whom acacia wood was found” (Exodus 35:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The verses stress regarding these items that the individuals with whom they were found brought them, in order to indicate that they had stored these items in advance in preparation for the building of the Tabernacle. </i>

Chapter 34

<b>“They shall craft an Ark of acacia wood: its length shall be two and a half cubits, and its width a cubit and a half, and its height a cubit and a half” (Exodus 25:10).</b> <br> “They shall craft an Ark of acacia wood,” that is what is written: “The Almighty, we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power” (Job 37:23). Our great rabbi<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.</i> said: We must give credit to Job, as everything that Elihu said, he came and added to his statements.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Elihu praised God in an ambiguous manner, such that his words can also be understood as blasphemy. Job expressed the praise of God in a clear manner (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Job said to his comrades: ‘What do you think, that everything you have said is all His praise? Who can relate all the praise and mighty deeds of the Holy One blessed be He. All the statements that you stated “Behold, these are but the tips of His ways”’ (Job 26:14). Elihu came and said: “The Almighty, we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power.” One who hears this verse says: Perhaps it is curses, God forbid. But this is what Elihu was saying: We have not found the [full] strength of the might of the Holy One blessed be He [displayed] toward His creations, as the Holy One blessed be He does not overly exert His creations; He engages a person only in accordance with his strength. You find when the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah, had He come upon them with the full extent of His strength, they would not have been able to withstand it, as it is stated: “If we continue to hear [the voice of the Lord our God, we will die]” (Deuteronomy 5:22). Rather, He came upon them only in accordance with their strength, as it is stated: “The voice of the Lord is with strength” (Psalms 29:4). “With His strength” is not said, but rather, “with strength,” in accordance with the strength of each and every one. <br>Another matter, “the Almighty, we cannot find Him; He is exalted in power.” When the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Craft a Tabernacle for Me,’ he began wondering and saying: ‘The glory of the Holy One blessed be He fills the upper and the lower worlds, and He says to me: Craft a Tabernacle for Me?’ Moreover, he was looking<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This means that he saw prophetically.</i> and saw Solomon arising and constructing the Temple, which is larger than the Tabernacle, and saying before the Holy One blessed be He: “For will God indeed dwell on the earth? [Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You, certainly not this House that I have built]” (I Kings 8:27). Moses said: ‘If Solomon said so regarding the Temple, which is much, much greater than the Tabernacle, how much more so regarding the Tabernacle?’ That is why Moses said:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Psalms 90 is attributed to Moses (see Psalms 90:1), and the following ten psalms are also assumed to have been authored by him (Rashi on Psalms 90:1). </i> “One who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, [who abides in the shadow of the Almighty]” (Psalms 91:1). Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: The One who dwells in shelter, He is exalted over all His creations. What is: “In the shadow of the Almighty”? In the shadow of God, in the shadow of the Merciful, in the shadow of the Gracious are not written here, but rather, “in the shadow of the Almighty” – in the shadow that Betzalel crafted.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Had the verse referred to a righteous person sitting in the shadow of God, it would have used a term for God that denotes His mercy. The fact that it refers to God as Almighty indicates that the verse does not mean “in the shadow of the Almighty,” but rather, “the Almighty [dwells] in the shadow” of the Tabernacle crafted by Betzalel (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). See also Maharzu. </i> That is why it says: “Who abides in the shadow of the Almighty.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You do not think as I think;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">You cannot fathom My Presence confined within a physical space, but I can. </i> but rather, twenty boards in the north, twenty in the south, and eight in the west.

Another matter, “they shall craft an Ark of acacia wood.” What is written above? “They shall take Me a gift” (Exodus 25:2). Immediately, “they shall craft an Ark of acacia wood.” Just as the Torah preceded everything, so too, in the crafting of the Tabernacle, the Ark preceded all the vessels. Just as light preceded all the acts of Creation, as it is written: “God said: Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3), in the Tabernacle as well, the crafting [needed to house the] Torah, which is called light, as it is written: “For the commandment is a lamp, the Torah is light” (Proverbs 6:23), preceded [the crafting of] all [other] vessels. <br>Another matter, “they shall craft an Ark.” Why is it that regarding all [other] vessels, “you shall craft” is written, and regarding the Ark, “they shall craft” is written? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom said: The Holy One blessed be He said to [Moses]: ‘Let everyone come and be involved in the Ark so that all of them will acquire the Torah.’ Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: There are three crowns: The crown of kingship, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna, <i>Avot</i> 4:13.</i> The crown of kingship, this is the table [for the showbread], in whose regard it is written: “A golden crown [<i>zer</i>] all around” (Exodus 25:24). The crown of priesthood, this is the altar, in whose regard it is written: “A golden crown [<i>zer</i>] all around” (Exodus 30:3). The crown of Torah, this is the Ark, in whose regard it is written: “A golden crown [<i>zer</i>]” (Exodus 25:11). Why is it written <i>zar </i>and pronounced <i>zer</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>zer</i> could have been written <i>zayin-yud-reish</i>, but it is written without the <i>yud</i>, so that it can also be vocalized <i>zar</i>. </i> It is to say to you that if a person merits, they become a crown [<i>zer</i>] for him, but if not, they become estranged [<i>zar</i>]. Why is it written regarding all of them, “you shall craft for it” (Exodus 25:24; 30:3), and regarding the Ark, it is written: “you shall craft upon it”? It is to teach you that the crown of Torah is superior to all of them. If a person acquires Torah, it is as though he acquired all of them.
Another matter, “they shall craft an Ark.” What is written above? “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me [and I will dwell among them]” (Exodus 25:8). The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘You are My flock and I am a shepherd,’ as it is stated: “You are My flock, the flock of My pasture; you are man” (Ezekiel 34:31). And ‘I am a shepherd,’ as it is stated: “Shepherd of Israel, listen” (Psalms 80:2). ‘Construct a pen for the Shepherd, so He will come and herd you.’ That is why it is stated: “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me, and I will dwell among them.” <br>‘You are a vineyard,’ as it is stated: “For the house of Israel is the vineyard of the Lord of hosts” (Isaiah 5:7). ‘I am the Guardian,’ as it is stated: “Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4). ‘Construct a hut for the Guardian so He may guard you.’ <br>‘You are children and I am your Father,’ as it is stated: “You are children to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1). And ‘I am your Father,’ as it is stated: “For I have been a Father to Israel” (Jeremiah 31:9). ‘It is an honor for the children when they are with their father, and an honor for the Father when He is with His children.’ Likewise it says: “The crown of elders is grandchildren, [and the glory of children is their fathers]” (Proverbs 17:6). ‘Construct a house for the Father, so He may come and dwell among His children.’ That is why it is stated: “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me [and I will dwell among them].”’

<b>“You shall craft the boards for the Tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright” (Exodus 26:15).</b> <br>“You shall craft the boards for the Tabernacle” (Exodus 26:15). That is what is written: “The trees of the Lord sate themselves, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted” (Psalms 104:16). There were many creations that the Holy One blessed be He created in His world, that the world was not fit to utilize, so the Holy One blessed be He concealed them from the world. What is [an example of] this? The light that was created on the first day, as Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: By the light that the Holy One blessed be He created on the first day, a person could gaze and see from one end of the world to the other. When the Holy One blessed be He saw that the actions of the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and the generation of the Dispersion would be corrupt, He rose and concealed it from them, as it is stated: “He prevented light from the wicked” (Job 38:15). For whom did He conceal it? For the righteous in the future, as it is stated: “God saw the light, that it was good” (Genesis 1:4). What is “that it was good”? That its light was suitable for the world, and was not harmful like this sun.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The light created on the first day would never shine too brightly or create heat too great for a person to bear. </i> Where did He conceal it? In the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “Light is sown for the righteous” (Psalms 97:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Since sowing is done in a garden, this alludes to the fact that God concealed the light in the Garden of Eden (Maharzu; Rabbi David Luria). </i> <br>There were many creations that the Holy One blessed be He created in the world that the world was not fit to utilize and were fit to be concealed, but they were not concealed, in deference to the Holy One blessed be He. What is [an example of] this? Gold. Rabbi Abahu said: The Holy One blessed be He imparted great goodness to the world through gold. A person changes one gold piece and thereby covers several expenditures, as it is stated: “The gold of that land is good” (Genesis 2:12). Its goodness is when it is in his house and its goodness is when it accompanies him on the way.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gold is convenient to store at home because of its value and the fact that it lasts for a long time without decay. It is also convenient to carry on one’s travels because one can take along a significant sum without having to carry a large, heavy quantity. </i> <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The world was not fit to utilize gold. Why was it created? For the Tabernacle and for the Temple, as it is stated: “The gold of that land is good,” just as it says: “That good mountain and the Lebanon” (Deuteronomy 3:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">“The good mountain” is understood as a reference to Jerusalem, and “the Lebanon” is understood as a reference to the Temple (see <i>Sifrei VaEtḥanan </i>25).</i> There were seven types of gold in the Temple: Good gold, pure gold, <i>Shaḥut</i> gold, <i>Sagur</i> gold, refined gold, <i>Parvayim </i>gold, and <i>Mufaz</i> gold. Good gold, in its plain sense. Pure, in that they would place it in a crucible and none of it would be missing. <i>Shaḥut</i> gold, as it was stretched like a thread [<i>ḥut</i>], and they would smear it like wax that is placed on a ledger. <i>Sagur </i>gold, as it would close [<i>soger</i>] all the gold merchants who were there.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">When this type of gold was being sold, gold merchants who were selling other types of gold would have to close up shop because they could not compete with its brilliance.</i> Refined gold, they would overlay the walls [of the Temple] with it. But isn’t it written: “Seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses”? (I Chronicles 29:4). Why do they call it silver [<i>kesef</i>]? Because it would shame [<i>makhsif</i>] all the gold that was there. <i>Mufaz </i>gold, Rabbi Patriki, brother of Rabbi Derosai, says: It is because it resembled sulfur that is ignited with fire.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The fire is very bright gold [<i>paz</i>].</i> <i>Parvayim </i>gold, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Because it resembles the blood of bulls. Some say, because it would produce fruits [<i>perot</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">When Solomon built the Temple he fashioned golden trees that would produce fruits which were used to fund Temple maintenance (see <i>Yoma</i> 21b; <i>Shir HaShirim Rabba </i>3:8:3).</i> <br>The cedars, too, were fit to be concealed, but were not concealed. Rabbi Ḥanina said: The world was not fit to utilize cedars. They were created only for the Tabernacle and for the Temple, as it is stated: “The trees of the Lord sate themselves, the cedars of Lebanon that He planted” (Psalms 104:16). Lebanon is nothing other than the Temple, as it is stated: “That good mountain and the Lebanon” (Deuteronomy 3:25). <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: They are twenty-four species of cedars, but there are only seven that are more outstanding than all of them, as it is stated: “I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle and pine trees [in the wilderness; I will place juniper, ash and boxwood together in the desert]” (Isaiah 41:19). Why were they not concealed? Because the Holy One blessed be He foresaw that [Israel] was destined to perform with them the labor of the Tabernacle, in the place where the Divine Presence was destined to dwell, as it is stated: “That birds will nest there” (Psalms 104:17). Does it enter your mind that birds would nest there? It is, rather, the birds that the priest would slaughter and sacrifice in the Temple. What is, “the stork has its home in the junipers”? (Psalms 104:17). Is the home of a stork in cedars? What is a stork [<i>ḥasida</i>]? This is the High Priest, as it is stated: “Your Tumin and Your Urim for Your pious one [<i>ḥasidekha</i>]” (Deuteronomy 33:8).
Another matter, “You shall craft the boards for the Tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright.” Why acacia wood? The Holy One blessed be He taught proper conduct for the generations: If a person seeks to build his house of a fruit-bearing tree, say to him: If the King of kings, to Whom everything belongs, when He said to craft the Tabernacle, He said: Bring only from a non-fruit-bearing tree; you, all the more so.
Another matter, “You shall craft the boards,” what is written before this matter? “See and craft” (Exodus 25:40).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This verse is addressed to Moses (see Exodus 25:1). </i> Was it Moses who crafted the Tabernacle? Is it not written: “Betzalel and Oholiav and every wise-hearted man crafted”? (Exodus 36:1). Rather, it was Moses in theory and Betzalel in practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Moses received the instructions from God, and Betzalel carried them out. </i> From here our Rabbis said to give reward to the one who causes the action to be performed like the one who performed it, as we find in Moses’s regard that Betzalel performed the labor of the Tabernacle, but the Holy One blessed be He ascribed to him [Moses] as though he had performed it, as it is stated: “The Tabernacle of the Lord that Moses had crafted in the wilderness” (I Chronicles 21:29).
Another matter, “You shall craft the boards [for the Tabernacle].” It should have said only: ‘You shall craft the boards into a Tabernacle.’ What is “for the Tabernacle”? It is because it stands as collateral [<i>lemashken</i>] as, if the enemies of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A euphemism for Israel.</i> become liable to be eradicated, it will be taken as collateral for them.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">It will be destroyed instead of them. </i> Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Are they not destined to have neither a Tabernacle nor a Temple; what will become of them?’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I will take a righteous one from them as collateral on their behalf, and I will atone for them all their iniquities.’ Likewise it says: “He killed all who were delights of the eye” (Lamentations 2:4).
Another matter, “You shall craft the boards.” What is written above? “This is the gift that you shall collect from them: Gold and silver and bronze” (Exodus 25:3). Gold, this is Babylon, as it is stated: “That image, its head was of fine gold” (Daniel 2:32).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The context of this verse is Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, in which Nebuchadnezzar saw an image made of different metals. Daniel interpreted it as representing his kingdom and those that would rise afterward (see Daniel 2:38–40). The head of gold represented Babylon (see Daniel 2:38).</i> Silver, this is Media, as it is stated: “Its breast and its arms of silver (Daniel 2:32). Bronze, this is Greece, as it is stated: “Its belly and its thighs of bronze” (Daniel 2:32). But iron is not written here, neither in the Temple nor in the Tabernacle. Why? It is because Edom, which destroyed the Temple, was analogized to it.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron” (Daniel 2:40).</i> This is to teach you that, in the future, the Holy One blessed be He will receive tributes from all the kingdoms other than Edom. But did Babylon not also destroy it?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Babylonians destroyed the first Temple, while the Romans, identified as descendants of Edom, destroyed the second Temple. </i> It is because it did not raze it. But what is written with regard to Edom? “Who said: Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation” (Psalms 137:7). That is why iron, to which Edom is analogized, is not written regarding the Tabernacle and the Temple. <br>Likewise, you find in the future that all the nations are destined to bring a tribute to the messianic king. Egypt brings first, and he will think he should not accept it from them. The Holy One blessed be He will say to him: ‘They were hosts to My children in Egypt.’ As it is stated: “Noblemen will arrive from Egypt; Kush will hasten to extend its hands to God” (Psalms 68:32). Immediately, he will accept it from them. Kush will draw an <i>a fortiori </i>inference: If he accepted [a gift] from Egypt, which enslaved them, all the more so [will he will accept it from] us, who did not enslave them. Immediately, “Kush will hasten to extend its hands to God.” Immediately, all the nations will hear and bring [gifts], as it is stated: “Kingdoms of the earth, sing to God” (Psalms 68:33). Then, the kingdom of Edom will draw an <i>a fortiori </i>inference for itself and say: If these, who are not their brethren, he accepted [gifts] from them, we, all the more so. It, too, will seek to bring a tribute to the messianic king. The Holy One blessed be He will say to him: “Castigate the beast of the reed” (Psalms 68:31).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Rome, which is identified as descending from Edom, is referred to here as a reed, based on the following statement of the Gemara: “Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: When Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter, Gavriel descended and implanted a reed into the sea, and a sandbar grew around it, and upon it the great city of Rome was built” (<i>Shabbat</i> 56b).</i> <br>Another matter, castigate the beast that resides among the reeds, as it is stated: “The boar from the forest gnaws at it” (Psalms 80:14). “The herd of cavalry horses among the calves of the people” (Psalms 68:31); the one that consumes the wealth of the peoples and comes with the authority of Abraham and says: ‘I am one of them, Esau, son of Isaac, son of Abraham.’<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Rome is identified as descending from Edom, which descends from Esau. </i> “Who grovel for pieces of silver” (Psalms 68:31); even if a person sins against it,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The kingdom of Edom.</i> and it becomes angry at him, it extends its palm, takes the money, and is reconciled. <br>And what is: “He scatters the peoples who desire battle”? (Psalms 68:31). It is that [Edom] scatters Israel from Torah study and assembles them for what the evil inclination desires. Alternatively, “he scatters the peoples who desire battle,” as they scattered Israel from the world. Alternatively, “he scatters the peoples” – they estranged Israel from Me, and they are bringing offerings?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">When they attempt to bring offerings to the messianic king, God will instruct him to reject them because of what they did. </i>
Another matter, “You shall craft the boards for the Tabernacle.” Rabbi Avin said: This is analogous to a king who had a fine visage. He said to a member of his household: ‘Create me [a portrait] like it.’ He said to him: ‘My lord king, I cannot create one like it.’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">I cannot make a portrait that will truly capture your fine appearance. </i> He said to him: ‘You with your paints and I with my glory.’<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Do what you can with the materials you have available, even if it does not match my true beauty. </i> So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “See and craft” (Exodus 25:40). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, am I a god that I can craft [vessels] like these?’ He said to him: “In their form” (Exodus 25:40); with sky blue and purple and scarlet wool. Just as you see above, so craft below, as it is stated: “Acacia wood standing upright”; just as it is in the heavenly host. If you craft it below as it is above, I will leave My supernal entourage and rest My Divine Presence in your midst below. Just as above, “seraphs are standing” (Isaiah 6:2), so, below, “acacia wood standing upright”; just as there are stars above, so, too, below. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: It teaches that the golden hooks in the Tabernacle appeared like the stars visible in the sky. <br>

Chapter 36

<b>“And you shall command the children of Israel, and they shall bring you pure olive oil, pressed for illumination, to kindle a lamp continually” (Exodus 27:20).</b> <br>“And you shall command,” that is what is written: “The Lord called your name a flourishing olive tree, fair of fruit and form” (Jeremiah 11:16). Is the olive the only tree after which Israel was called? Was it not called after all sorts of fine and excellent trees? [Israel was called] a grapevine and a fig tree, as it is stated: “You transported a grapevine from Egypt” (Psalms 80:9); a fig tree, as it is stated: “Like the first fruit to ripen on a fig tree” (Hosea 9:10). A date palm, as it is stated: “This, your stature, is like a date palm” (Song of Songs 7:8). A cedar, as it is stated: “Like a cedar in Lebanon he grows tall” (Psalms 92:13). The nut tree, as it is stated: “I went down to the nut garden” (Song of Songs 6:11). He also called them like all types of growths in irrigated fields, as it is stated: “Your irrigated fields are a pomegranate orchard, [with delicious fruit, henna and lavender, lavender and saffron, lemongrass and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes with all the finest spices]” (Song of Songs 4:13–14). And Jeremiah came to say: “The Lord called your name a flourishing olive tree, fair of fruit and form”? Rather, just as the olive, while it is on the tree one picks it, then one takes it down from the tree and it is beaten, and after it is beaten, it is taken up to the olive press and placed into the mill where one grinds it, then one surrounds it with ropes, brings stones, and then they produce their oil. So too, Israel: idolaters come and beat them from place to place, incarcerate them, bind them in chains, and surround them with fences. Then they repent and the Holy One blessed be He answers them. From where is it derived? As it is stated: “The children of Israel sighed [due to the bondage, and they cried out, and their plea came up to God]” (Exodus 2:23). Likewise, “When you are in distress, and all these matters befall you…[you will return to the Lord your God, and you will heed His voice], as the Lord your God is a merciful God” (Deuteronomy 4:30–31), That is “the Lord called your name a flourishing olive tree, fair of fruit and form.” <br>Another matter, what did Jeremiah see that he likened our ancestors to an olive tree? It is that all liquids intermingle with one another but oil does not mix, but rather it stands alone. So too, Israel does not intermingle with the idolaters, as it is stated: “You shall not intermarry with them” (Deuteronomy 7:3). <br>Another matter, all liquids, when a person mixes them he does not know which is on the bottom and which is on top; however, oil, even if you mix it with all the liquids in the world, it will remain above them. So too, when our ancestors would perform the will of the Omnipresent, they would stand above the idolaters, as it is stated: “[It shall be if you shall heed the voice of the Lord your God to take care to perform all His commandments that I am commanding you today], the Lord your God will place you uppermost [over all the nations of the earth]” (Deuteronomy 28:1). That is “the Lord called your name a flourishing olive tree, fair of fruit and form.” <br>Another matter, “a flourishing olive tree,” that is what is written: “Beautiful in its view, joy of the entire earth, [is Mount Zion]” (Psalms 48:3). What is “beautiful in its view [<i>nof</i>]”? In the Greek language they call a bride, nymph.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Jerusalem was beautiful in the eyes of all beholders, like a bride.</i> “Joy of the entire earth,” it is because there was no one of Israel who was distressed when the Temple was intact. Why? It is because a person would enter it full of iniquities, would sacrifice an offering, and would thereby achieve atonement. There is no greater joy than when one would emerge from there righteous. That is “the Lord called your name a flourishing olive tree, fair of fruit and form.” <br>It is written regarding Tyre: “You, Tyre, said: I am perfect in beauty” (Ezekiel 27:3). You said it, but others do not say it; however, everyone speaks the praise of Jerusalem, as it is stated: “Is this the city of which they said it was perfect in beauty?” (Lamentations 2:15). <br>It is written: “Mount Zion, the northern summit, the city of the great king” (Psalms 48:3), the place in which they sacrifice offerings, as it is stated: “He shall slaughter it on the north side of the altar before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:11). That is why it is stated: “The Lord called your name a flourishing olive tree, fair of fruit and form.” Just as oil illuminates, so the Temple illuminates for the entire world, as it is stated: “Nations will walk by your light” (Isaiah 60:3). That is why our ancestors were called “a flourishing olive tree,” because they illuminate for all with their faith. That is why the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “They shall bring you pure olive oil.”
It is not that I need them,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">God says: It is not that I need the light of the candelabra. </i> but rather, it is so that you illuminate for Me just as I illuminated for you. Why? It is to elevate you before all the nations, so that they will say: ‘Israel illuminates for the One who illuminates for all.’ This is analogous to a sighted person and a blind person who were walking. The sighted person said to the blind person: ‘Come and I will guide you,’ and the blind person was walking. When they entered the house, the sighted person said to the blind person: ‘Go kindle the lamp for me, and illuminate for me, so you will not be beholden to me for accompanying you. That is why I am telling you to illuminate.’ So, the sighted person is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “For the Lord, His eyes range throughout the entire land” (II Chronicles 16:9). The blind person is Israel, as it is stated: “We grope a wall like the blind, like the eyeless we grope; we stumble at noon as in the dark of night” (Isaiah 59:10), with the [Golden] Calf at six hours.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Israel committed the sin of the Golden Calf at noon, six hours into the daytime, and thereby stumbled spiritually at midday. </i> The Holy One blessed be He was illuminating for them and guided them, as it is stated: “The Lord was going before them by day” (Exodus 13:21). When they came to craft the Tabernacle, He called Moses and said to him: “They shall bring you pure olive oil.” Israel said: ‘“For You will kindle my lamp” (Psalms 18:29), and You say that we should illuminate for You?’ He said to them: ‘It is in order to elevate you, so you will illuminate for Me just as I illuminated for you.’ That is why it is stated: “A flourishing olive tree.”
Another matter, “a flourishing olive tree,” see how words of Torah illuminate for a person when he engages in them, but anyone who does not engage and does not know, stumbles. This is analogous to one who is standing in the darkness; if he attempts to walk, he encounters a stone and stumbles over it, or he encounters a sewage pit, falls in, and bangs his face on the ground. Why? Because he does not have a lamp in his hand. So too, a layman who does not have words of Torah which him encounters a transgression, stumbles, and dies, as the Divine Spirit cries out: “He will die for lack of admonishment” (Proverbs 5:23), and admonishment is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “Hold fast to admonition, do not let go; [safeguard it, as it is your life]” (Proverbs 4:13).<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is an allusion to Torah, which is also called “your life” (Deuteronomy 30:20 with <i>Targum Yonatan</i>). </i> Why does he die? Because he does not know Torah and he goes and sins, as it is stated: “The way of the wicked is like blackness; they do not know on what they stumble” (Proverbs 4:19). But those who engage in Torah, they illuminate everywhere. This is analogous to one who is standing in blackness with a lamp in his hand; he sees a stone and he does not stumble, he sees a sewage pit, but does not fall. Why? Because he has a lamp in his hand, as it is stated: “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path” (Psalms 119:105). Likewise, “If you run, you will not stumble,” (Proverbs 4:12). <br>Likewise, “The soul of man is the lamp of the Lord” (Proverbs 20:27). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Let My lamp be in your hand and your lamp in My hand.’ What is the lamp of the Holy One blessed be He? It is the Torah, as it is stated: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light” (Proverbs 6:23). What is “for the mitzva is a lamp”? It is that anyone who fulfills a mitzva is as though he kindles a lamp before the Holy One blessed be He, and sustains his soul, which is called a lamp, as it is stated: “The soul of man is the lamp of the Lord.” What is “Torah is light”? Many times a person desires in his heart to fulfill a mitzva, and the evil inclination that is within him says: ‘What is in it for you to fulfill a mitzva and lose your property? Instead of giving to others, give to your children.’ The good inclination says to him: ‘Give it for a mitzva.’ See what is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp” – just as this lamp, when it is kindled, even thousands upon thousands of wax and tallow candles are kindled from it, its light remains undiminished. So, anyone who gives for a mitzva does not lose his property. That is why it says: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light.”
“And you shall command,” that is what is written: “You would call and I would answer You, You would yearn [<i>tikhsof</i>] for Your handiwork” (Job 14:15). Regarding four matters the Holy One blessed be He longed for his handiwork. “<i>Tikhsof</i>” is nothing other than longing, as it is stated: “Because you longed [<i>nikhsof nikhsafta</i>]” (Genesis 31:30); “My soul longs [<i>nikhsefa</i>], indeed it pines” (Psalms 84:3). These are the four matters: The Holy One blessed be He bears [<i>sovel</i>] His world, as it is stated: “I have done and I will carry, I will bear [<i>esbol</i>] and I will rescue” (Isaiah 46:4), yet He commanded the sons of Kehat to bear Him, as it is stated: “But he did not give to the sons of Kehat, because the sacred service is upon them; they shall bear on the shoulder” (Numbers 7:9). Know, that, as it were, He bore them when they came to the Jordan, as it is stated: “The Jordan was overflowing all its banks” (Joshua 3:15), and the sons of Kehat were unable to cross. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He bore them, as it is stated: “It shall be as the soles of the feet of the priests will rest” (Joshua 3:13). Rabbi Berekhya said: The Ark bears its bearers. The priests did not bear it, but rather, it bore them, as it is stated: “The soles of the feet of the priests were drawn up [onto dry ground]” (Joshua 4:18). <br>The Holy One blessed be He guards [<i>meshamer</i>] His world, as it is stated: “Behold, the Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. The Lord is your Guardian” (Psalms 121:4–5). And He said to Israel that they should guard Him, as it is stated: “And those encamped in front of the Tabernacle, to the east, in front of the Tent of Meeting: [Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, keeping [<i>shomrim</i>] the commission of the Sanctuary]” (Numbers 3:38). He illuminates the world, as it is written: “The earth shone with His glory” (Ezekiel 43:2). And He said of Israel: “They shall bring you pure olive oil.” That is, “yearn for Your handiwork.” <br>21

Chapter 37

<b>“And you, draw Aaron your brother near to you, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, to serve Me: Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, Elazar and Itamar, Aaron’s sons” (Exodus 28:1).</b> <br> “And you, draw Aaron your brother near to you,” that is what is written: “From it will come a cornerstone, from it a peg, from it a bow of war” (Zechariah 10:4). Come and see: When the early nations would seek to appoint a king for themselves, they would bring [a man] from anywhere and appoint him over them, as it says: “He reigned in Edom” (Genesis 36:32), from Dinhava, from Basra, and likewise, all of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah (Genesis 36:32–39) lists various kings of Edom and where they were from; the first two were from Dinhava and Basra, respectively. These places were not in Edom. </i> But Israel is not so. Their great ones are from them, their kings are from them, their priests are from them, their prophets are from them, their princes are from them, as it is stated: “From it will come a cornerstone,” this is King David, as it is stated: “The stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone” (Psalms 118:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages apply this verse to King David (see <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 118), who was a humble shepherd and the youngest and least prominent of his brothers before he was appointed king. </i> “From it a peg” this is the High Priest, as it is stated: “I will affix him as a peg in a secure place” (Isaiah 22:23). “From it a bow of war,” as it is stated: “They were armed with bows, both right and left-handed” (I Chronicles 12:2). “From it every oppressor will be gone together” (Zechariah 10:4), these are the judges’ scribes. And likewise it says: “And you, draw Aaron your brother near to you, and his sons with him.” From where? It is from among the children of Israel. <br>This is analogous to a king who had a friend and sought to appoint a treasurer, and he appointed [his friend] over his entire treasury. Sometime later, he sought to appoint a military chief of staff, and that friend thought that perhaps he would choose him, but he did not choose him. [The king] said to him: ‘Go and appoint a military chief of staff.’ He said to him: ‘My lord, from which noble family?’ He said to him: ‘From your noble family.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He sought to appoint someone over the labor of the Tabernacle, and He selected Moses as the administrator over the judges and over everything. When the Holy One blessed be He sought to appoint a High Priest, Moses thought that perhaps he would become the High Priest. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Go and appoint a High Priest for Me.’ He said before Him: ‘From what tribe shall I appoint for You?’ He said to him: ‘From the tribe of Levi.’ At that moment, Moses rejoiced. He said: ‘My tribe is so beloved.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘It is Aaron, your brother.’ That is why it is stated: “And you, draw Aaron your brother near to you.” <br>The Rabbis say: All forty years that Israel was in the wilderness, Moses served in the high priesthood. Some say: He served only during the seven days of inauguration. Rabbi Berekhya says in the name of Rabbi Simon: All forty years Moses served in the high priesthood, as it is stated: “The sons of Amram, Aaron and Moses; [Aaron was separated that he should be most holy, he and his sons forever, to offer before the Lord, to serve Him, and to bless in His name forever]” (I Chronicles 23:13), and it is written: “And Moses, the man of God, [his sons are named among the tribe of Levi]” (I Chronicles 23:14).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The implication of the verse is that Moses’ sons were regular Levites, but he himself functioned as a priest.</i>
Another matter, “and you, draw…near to you,” they said: When Moses descended from Sinai and saw Israel engaged in that act,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the Golden Calf. </i> he looked at Aaron and he was striking it with a hammer. He intended only to delay them until Moses descended, but Moses believed that Aaron was a partner with them, and he was upset with him. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Moses, I know how Aaron’s intention was for the best.’ This is analogous to a prince who was arrogant, and he took the chisel to undermine his father’s house. His tutor said to him: ‘Do not exhaust yourself, give it to me and I will undermine it.’ The king looked at him and said to him: ‘I know what your intention was. As you live, I will not place anyone in charge of my palace other than you.’ So too, when Israel said to Aaron: “Rise, craft us a god,” (Exodus 32:1), he said to them: “Remove the rings of gold” (Exodus 32:2). He said to them: ‘I am a priest, I will craft it and I will sacrifice before it.’ But he engaged in it only to delay them until Moses would come. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Aaron, I know what your intention was. As you live, I will not place anyone in charge of the sacrifices of My children other than you,’ as it is stated: “And you, draw [Aaron your brother] near to you.” Where did He say this matter to Moses? At the Tabernacle. <br>Rabbi Levi said: [This is analogous] to the friend of a king, who was the finance minister and the justice minister. [The king] sought to choose a military chief of staff and informed [his friend], saying to him: ‘It is your brother.’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He selected Moses as the finance minister, “not so My servant Moses; [in all My house he is faithful]” (Numbers 12:7). He selected him as justice minister, as it is stated: “Moses sat to judge the people” (Exodus 18:13). When He sought to appoint a High Priest, He informed him and said to him: ‘It is Aaron your brother.’
Another matter, “and you, draw…near to you,” that is what is written: “Happy is the one You choose to bring near You to dwell in Your courtyards” (Psalms 65:5). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is analogous to the friend of a king who publicly criticized the king, and [yet the king] made him his protégé, so that he would not move from the palace, and he would eat the king’s remnants. So too, Aaron was the equal to all Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He behaved as Israel did in the act of the Golden Calf, even though his intent was different.</i> and the Holy One blessed be He selected him as the High Priest. He said to him: “He shall not emerge from the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 21:12), and he ate the remnants of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The remnant of the meal-offering [is for Aaron]” (Leviticus 2:10).
Another matter, “and you, draw…near to you,” that is what is written: “Had Your Torah not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction” (Psalms 119:92). When the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “And you, draw…near to you,” [Moses] was upset. [God] said to him: ‘I had a Torah, and I gave it to you. Were it not for it, I would have eliminated My world.’ <br>This is analogous to a wise man who took his relative [as a wife] and she spent ten years with him but did not bear children.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As such, he was required to take another wife in order to fulfill his obligation to have children (see <i>Yevamot</i> 64a). </i> He said to her: ‘Seek me a wife.’ He said to her: ‘I could take without your permission, but I am requesting your forbearance.’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">As a sign of respect to his wife, he asked her consent and assistance in choosing an additional wife. </i> So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘I could have selected your brother High Priest without your knowledge, but I sought that you should be his superior.’ <br>“From among the children of Israel” – from all the lands, the Holy One blessed be He chose the Land of Israel. From the Land of Israel, He chose the Temple. From the Temple, He chose only the chamber of the Holy of Holies. Similarly, the Holy One blessed be He chose Israel. From Israel, He chose only the tribe of Levi. From the tribe of Levi, He chose Aaron, as it is stated: “And choose him from all the tribes of Israel” (I Samuel 2:28). <i>Teruma </i>is on one side and tithe on one side.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teruma</i> is of a higher degree of sanctity and is given to the priests; the tithe is given to Levites (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> Nadav and Avihu are on one side and Elazar and Itamar on one side. Elazar and Itamar were chosen, as it is stated: “And choose him from all the tribes of Israel.” That is why it is stated: “Happy is the one You choose to bring near You to dwell in Your courtyards” (Psalms 65:5).

Chapter 38

<b>“This is the matter that you shall do to them to sanctify them to serve as priests to Me: Take one young bull and two rams, unblemished” (Exodus 29:1).</b> <br>“This is the matter that you shall do to them” – that is what is written: “Forever, Lord, Your word stands in the heavens” (Psalms 119:89). David said: Just as You are truth, as it is stated: “The Lord God is truth” (Jeremiah 10:10), so Your word is truth, as it is stated: “Forever, Lord, Your word stands in the heavens.” Do not say, “in the heavens,” but rather, like the heavens:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The letter <i>bet</i> in “in the heavens [<i>bashamayim</i>]” should be read as a <i>kaf</i>, which looks very similar to a <i>bet</i>, giving the meaning, “like the heavens [<i>kashamayim</i>].” </i> Just as in the beginning, You decreed and the heavens were made, so too, Your statement concerning the sanctification of Aaron and his sons shall endure forever, as it is stated: “It shall be for him and for his descendants after him a covenant of an eternal priesthood” (Numbers 25:13). Why is it so? “So will be My word [<i>devari</i>] that emerges from My mouth; [it will not return to Me unfulfilled]” (Isaiah 55:11). That is why it says: “This is the matter [<i>davar</i>].”
Another matter: “This is the matter” – that is what is written: “Are You not from ancient times, Lord my God, my Holy One? We will not die” (Habakkuk 1:12). Until Adam the first man stood and ate of the tree, I would say: Let him not eat from the tree and he will not die, as it is stated: “Are You not from ancient times, Lord my God, my Holy One? We will not die.” However, because he violated Your command, You brought death upon him to smite people,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Some suggest that the text should say admonish [<i>lehokhiaḥ</i>] rather than smite [<i>lehakot</i>] (see <i>Yefe To’ar</i>). </i> as it is stated: “Lord, You set them for judgment” (Habakkuk 1:12). You decree and say: You shall be sacred to your God,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">See Leviticus 21:6. </i> and likewise, “this is the matter that you shall do to them to sanctify them.” Master of the universe, if you want us to be sacred, rid us of death, as it is stated: “Are You not from ancient times, Lord my God, my Holy One? We will not die.” [God] said to them: It is impossible; “Lord, You set them for judgment.”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Death is a decree that cannot be revoked. </i>
“Take one young bull” – that is what is written: “Great are the works of the Lord, ready for all that is desired” (Psalms 111:2). When He wishes, He calls it in the feminine, as it is stated: “They shall take for You an unflawed red cow” (Numbers 19:2),<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse the feminine term cow is used, indicating that the animal must be female. </i> and when He wishes, He calls it in the masculine, as it is stated: “Take one young bull.” To atone for them for what is destined to transpire,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">These offerings bring atonement for the sin of the golden calf. </i> as it is stated: “He said to Aaron: Take for yourself a young calf as a sin offering” (Leviticus 9:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This offering also brought atonement for the sin of the golden calf. Thus, the three offerings for this purpose were all from cattle, but one was a cow, one a bull, and one a calf. </i> That is why it is stated: “Great are the works of the Lord, ready for all that is desired.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is understood as praising God for providing a means of atonement for the sin of the golden calf. </i> <br>Another matter: [“Great are the works of the Lord”] (Psalms 111:2), in that the Holy One blessed be He honored Aaron, as He clothed him like the ministering angels, as it is stated: “For he is an angel of the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 2:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Not only did God provide atonement for Aaron’s role in the sin of the golden calf, He elevated him and appointed him as priest. </i> Rabbi Yehuda said: From here they said: Every priest who eats <i>teruma</i> but is not a man of Torah will not be a priest in the future. Rather, he is excluded from three matters, as it is stated: “For you have rejected knowledge. I will reject you [<i>va’emasekha</i>] from serving as priests for Me” (Hosea 4:6). There are three <i>alefs </i>in it,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>va’emasekha</i> is spelled here as <i>vav alef mem alef samekh alef khaf</i>, whereas ordinarily it would be spelled without the third <i>alef</i>. </i> as he is rejected from the priesthood, from the Temple, and from serving as a Levite. However, if he is a man of Torah, he is like an angel, as it is stated: “For the lips of the priest will safeguard knowledge, and they will seek Torah from his mouth, for he is an angel of the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 2:7). If not, look what is written: “A land of darkness [<i>efata</i>], like blackness” (Job 10:22) – this is Gehenna, where the wicked fly like birds [<i>kaof</i>]. Alternatively, <i>efata</i>, as the wicked are tired [<i>ayefim</i>] in it. Who descends there? Rabbi Ḥama said: One who is not accustomed to order his studies in an organized fashion and rejects them, as it is stated: “The shadow of death and disarray” (Job 10:22). <br>“And they will seek Torah from his mouth” (Malachi 2:7) – if he toils in it, he does not suffice with that, but he becomes a disciple of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “All your children will be disciples of the Lord” (Isaiah 54:13), and likewise, “But your Teacher will no longer be concealed, and your eyes will see your Teacher” (Isaiah 30:20).
Another matter: “This is the matter” – that is what is written: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3). That is what the verse said: “I wash my hands in purity, [and I circle Your altar, Lord], sounding a voice of thanksgiving” (Psalms 26:6–7). Is it, perhaps, to sacrifice bulls and rams? The verse states: “Sounding a voice of thanksgiving.” Because Israel said: Master of the universe, the princes sin,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the king; see Leviticus 4:22. </i> they bring an offering, and it is atoned for them; the anointed<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the High Priest; see Leviticus 4:3. </i> sins, he brings an offering, and it is atoned for him. We do not have an offering. He said to them: “If the entire congregation of Israel shall err unwittingly.… [they shall bring a young bull as a sin offering]” (Leviticus 4:13–14). They said to Him: We are poor, and we do not have the means to bring offerings. He said to them: I am seeking words, as it is stated: “Take words with you and return to the Lord” (Hosea 14:3), and I will forgive all your sins. “Words” are nothing other than words of Torah, as it is stated: “These are the words that Moses spoke” (Deuteronomy 1:1). <br>They said to Him: But we do not know.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">We do not know Torah. </i> He said to them: Weep and pray before Me, and I will accept it. When your ancestors were enslaved in Egypt, was it not through prayer that I redeemed them, as it is stated: “The children of Israel groaned due to the work, and they cried out” (Exodus 2:23)? In the days of Joshua, was it not through prayer that I performed miracles on their behalf, as it is stated: “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6)? What did I say to him: “Extend the javelin” (Joshua 8:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Immediately, the city of Ai fell before them.</i> In the days of the Judges, through weeping I heard their cry, as it is stated: “It was when the children of Israel cried to the Lord” (Judges 6:7). In the days of Samuel, was it not through prayer that I heard them, as it is stated: “Samuel called out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord answered him (I Samuel 7:9)? Likewise, the people of Jerusalem, even though they angered Me, because they wept, I had mercy on them, as it is stated: “For so said the Lord: Sing with joy for Jacob, and exult.… [they will come with weeping and supplications] (Jeremiah 31:6–8). That is, I ask of you neither sacrifices nor offerings, but rather, words, as it is stated: “Take words with you and return to the Lord” (Hosea 14:3). That is why David said: “I wash my hands in purity” (Psalms 26:6). He does not say: “To sacrifice to you” but rather, “sounding a voice of thanksgiving” (Psalms 26:7), that I thank you for the words of Torah. <br>Another matter: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3) – Moses said: “The abode of the God of eternity” (Deuteronomy 33:27), this is Israel, as by their merit the world was created and upon them the world stands. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] says: “He drove the enemy away from before you” (Deuteronomy 33:27) – this is Haman, as it is stated: “[Esther said:] A man who is an adversary and an enemy, [this evil Haman]” (Esther 7:6). Why “an adversary and an enemy”? An adversary [to God] above and an enemy [to Israel] below; an adversary to the fathers and an enemy to the children;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Haman descended from Amalek, an old enemy of Israel. </i> an adversary to me and an enemy to you.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase in the verse was spoken by Esther to Aḥashverosh. The midrash is asserting that she said that Haman was not just her enemy, he was an enemy to Aḥashverosh as well. </i> “And He said: Destroy” (Deuteronomy 33:27) – these are his sons.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">God said that Haman’s sons would be destroyed. </i> “Israel dwelled securely, alone is the spring [<i>ein</i>] of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:28) – <i>ein </i>is nothing other than prophecy, as it is stated: “For the Lord poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep and He closed your eyes [<i>eineikhem</i>]; [He covered the prophets]” (Isaiah 29:10). <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said: Great is [God’s] love of Israel, as the Holy One blessed be He changes the law of nature for their benefit, as He rains manna for them from the heavens and causes dew to rise for them from the ground, as it is stated: “The layer of dew lifted” (Exodus 16:14), and likewise, “His heavens drip dew” (Deuteronomy 33:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Manna fell from heaven, whereas generally food is grown from the ground. Dew, which was viewed as naturally falling from heaven, came from the ground in addition to coming from heaven. </i> When Moses saw the reward given to the righteous, he said to them: “Happy are you, Israel; who is like you, a people saved by the Lord” (Deuteronomy 33:29), people who are served by the Holy One blessed be He. “The shield [<i>magen</i>] of your assistance” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Abraham, as it is stated: “Who delivered [<i>migen</i>] your adversaries into your hand” (Genesis 14:20). “And who is the sword of your honor” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Isaac, who extended his neck to the sword. “Your enemies will seek to deceive you” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Jacob, as it is stated: “And went to a land, due to his brother Jacob” (Genesis 36:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Esau feared Jacob, but claimed that he left because the land was not large enough for the two of them.</i> “And you will tread on their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – in the days of Mordekhai, as it is stated: “Haman took the garments and the horse” (Esther 6:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Haman took the royal horse and led Mordekhai on a celebratory procession. The Sages relate that in order for Mordekhai to get onto the horse, Haman bent over and Mordekhai stepped on him (see <i>Megilla</i> 16a; <i>Esther Rabba</i> 10:4). </i> <br>What caused Mordekhai to achieve this greatness? Say it is because he would constantly pray, as it is stated: “Mordekhai knew everything that was done […and cried a loud and bitter cry]” (Esther 4:1). Even after he saw himself achieve prominence, he never became haughty and never ceased from prayer, but rather, “Mordekhai returned” (Esther 6:12), just as he was initially.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Even after being paraded around in the king’s garment on the king’s horse, Mordekhai returned to his former position at the king’s gate. He did not grow haughty from the experience. </i> “The Lord your God will place all these curses” (Deuteronomy 30:7), not on you, but “on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who pursued you” (Deuteronomy 30:7). And will you cease from prayer? No, but rather, what is written thereafter: “You will return and heed the voice of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 30:8), just as Mordekhai did, as it is stated: “Mordekhai returned to the king’s gate” (Esther 6:12), as he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. That is why it is stated: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3). Here, too, it says: “This is the matter,” because the Holy One blessed be He acceded to Aaron only through prayer, as it is stated: “The Lord was incensed with Aaron to destroy him, [and I prayed on behalf of Aaron, as well, at that time]” (Deuteronomy 9:20).
Another matter: “This is the matter” – that is what is written: “The wise will inherit honor” (Proverbs 3:35). Honor is nothing other than Torah. Know [this to be true]: What is said at the beginning of Chronicles? “Adam, Seth, Enosh” (Chronicles 1:1), and likewise all of them; you do not find honor written regarding any of them until you reach Yabetz, as it is stated: “Yabetz was honored more than his brethren” (I Chronicles 4:9). Why is honor written in his regard? It is because he toiled in Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Sages assert that Yabetz toiled in Torah and taught Torah to the masses; see, e.g., <i>Temura</i> 16a. </i> That is, “the wise will inherit honor.” Likewise you find regarding Aaron. What is written? “The Torah of truth was in his mouth” (Malachi 2:6). What did the Holy One blessed be He say to Moses? “You shall make holy vestments for Aaron your brother, for honor and for splendor” (Exodus 28:2). All this was due to the Torah in which he toiled. That is, “the wise will inherit honor.”
Another matter: “This is the matter [<i>hadavar</i>]” – that is what is written: “Forever, Lord, Your word [<i>devarkha</i>] stands in the heavens” (Psalms 119:89). Does the word of the Lord not stand on the earth, but only in the heavens? Rabbi Ḥizkiya bar Ḥiyya said: Because the Holy One blessed be He promised something in the heavens, and after two hundred and ten years the promise that the Holy One blessed be He promised to the righteous one was fulfilled. How so? When the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: “Go from your land.… I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:1–2), he said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, what benefit do I have from all these blessings, when I am leaving this world without children?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Do you already know that you will not beget children?’ He said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, I see in my constellation that I will not beget children.’ He said to him: ‘Is it the constellation that you fear? As you live, just as it is impossible for a person to count the stars, so it will be impossible to count your descendants.’ Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin: At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He lifted Abraham above the top of the firmament and said to him: “Look now to the heavens, and count the stars, if you could count them, and He said to him: So will be your descendants” (Genesis 15:5). He said to him: ‘Just as you see these and you are unable to count them, so will your descendants be such that no person will be able to count them.’ <br>Likewise you find regarding Jacob that the Holy One blessed be He promised him and said to him: “Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth [and you shall spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south] (Genesis 28:14), and likewise, “I will descend with you to Egypt, and I will take you up again” (Genesis 46:4), and the Holy One blessed be He fulfilled it for him. That is, “forever, Lord, Your word stands in the heavens” (Psalms 119:89). Likewise you find regarding Aaron that the Holy One blessed be He promised to Moses and said to him: “And you, draw Aaron your brother near to you” (Exodus 28:1). That is, “this is the matter that you shall do to them.”
Rabbi Ḥanina said: Let one who is holy come, enter the holy, sacrifice before the Holy, and atone for the holy. Let one who is holy come – this is Aaron, as it is stated: “To Aaron, the holy one of the Lord” (Psalms 106:16). Enter the holy [<i>lekadosh</i>] – this is the Sanctuary, as it is stated: “The Sanctuary [<i>mikdash</i>], my Lord, that Your hands established” (Exodus 15:17). Sacrifice before the Holy – this is the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “For I am holy, the Lord” (Leviticus 19:2). And atone for the holy – these are Israel, as it is stated: “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 19:2). <br>“Take one young bull [and two rams, unblemished]” – Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Ḥama said: That is what is written: “Telling the outcome from the outset” (Isaiah 46:10). “One [young] bull” – this is Aaron. “And two rams” – these are Elazar and Itamar. He gave him a hint that two of his sons are destined to die, and only two would serve.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The bull was to atone for Aaron’s role in the sin of the golden calf. The two rams served to sanctify two of Aaron’s sons to serve as priests, despite the fact that he had four sons. This hinted to the fact that two would die. </i>
Another matter: “This is the matter” – on the basis of what merit would Aaron enter the Holy of Holies? Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Yishmael said: The merit of circumcision would enter with him, as it is stated: “With this [<i>bezot</i>] shall Aaron come [into the Sanctuary]” (Leviticus 16:3) – this is circumcision, just as it says: “This is [<i>zot</i>] My covenant that you shall observe” (Genesis 17:10). Likewise it says: “My covenant was with him, life and peace” (Malachi 2:5). <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The merit of the tribes would enter with him, as it is stated: “This is [<i>vezeh</i>] the matter that you shall do to them.” The numerical value of <i>zeh </i>is twelve;<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Zayin </i>– 7; <i>heh </i>– 5. Together they sum to twelve.</i> these are the twelve stones that were placed on Aaron’s heart, upon which were the names of the tribes. They were placed in this order: Reuben, ruby; Simeon, topaz; Levi, emerald; Judah, carbuncle; Issachar, sapphire; Zebulun, clear quartz; Dan, jacinth; Naphtali, agate: Gad, amethyst; Asher, beryl; Joseph, onyx; Benjamin, chalcedony. What is the reason? So the Holy One blessed be He would look at them and at the priestly vestments upon [the High Priest’s] entry on Yom Kippur and be reminded of the merit of the tribes.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">The High Priest would wear four garments of white linen when he entered the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur. He would not be wearing the breastplate with the stones representing the tribes. Nonetheless, when the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies in accordance with the Torah’s requirements, the merit of that observance and the merit of the priestly garments he would wear most of the time would arouse Divine mercy. </i> <br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: This is analogous to the son of kings whose tutor would enter before [the king] to speak in favor of his son,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The son had sinned against the king and the tutor sought to assuage the king’s anger. </i> but he feared that perhaps [the king’s] attendants would harm him. What did the king do? He clothed him in his royal purple garment so they would see him and fear him. So too, Aaron would regularly enter the Holy of Holies. Were it not for the many merits that would enter with him and assist him, he would not have been able to enter. Why? It is because the ministering angels were there. What did the Holy One blessed be He do for him? He gave him the [garments] like the holy garments, as it is stated: “You shall make tunics for the sons of Aaron” (Exodus 28:40) just as it is written: “And He donned righteousness like a coat of armor and a helmet of salvation on His head; He donned garments of vengeance [for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak]” (Isaiah 59:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The four references to God’s clothing, as it were, parallel the four garments with which the High Priest enters the Holy of Holies. </i>
“You shall mount it with a stone mounting” (Exodus 28:17) – how were they placed? A row of ruby, topaz; and emerald; on the ruby was written: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Reuben. On the topaz Simeon was written. On the emerald, Levi was written. “The second row, carbuncle, sapphire, and clear quartz” (Exodus 28:18) – on the carbuncle, Judah was written. On the sapphire, Issachar was written. On the clear quartz, Zebulun was written. “The third row, jacinth, agate, amethyst” (Exodus 28:19) – on the jacinth, Dan was written. On the agate, Naphtali was written. On the amethyst, Gad was written. “The fourth row, beryl, onyx, and chalcedony” (Exodus 28:20) – on the beryl, Asher was written. On the onyx, Joseph was written. On the chalcedony was written: Benjamin, tribes of Yeshurun.

Chapter 40

<b>“The Lord spoke to Moses saying: See, I have called by name Betzalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah” (Exodus 31:1–2).</b> <br>“The Lord spoke…See, I have called by name Betzalel,” this is how Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba began: “Then He saw it and related it, prepared it, and also studied it” (Job 28:27). The Holy One blessed be He foresaw that Israel would accept the Torah, as had it not been so, He would not have created the world, as it is stated: “Then He saw it and related it.” What is written thereafter? “He said to man [<i>adam</i>]: Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom” (Job 28:28). <i>Adam </i>is nothing other than Israel, as it is stated: “You, My flock, flock of My pasture, you are man [<i>adam</i>]” (Ezekiel 34:31). “Then He saw it and related it,” at Sinai; “prepared it,” in the Tent of Meeting; “and also studied it,” on the plains of Moav in the book of Deuteronomy. <br>Another matter, “then He saw it and related it,” the Rabbis said: A person must take an example<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">From God.</i> in saying his chapter of <i>halakha</i>, his <i>aggada</i>, or his midrash. When he seeks to say them in public, he should not say: ‘Since I know it well, when I enter to lecture I will speak.’ Rav Aḥa said: You learn it from God. When He sought to relate the Torah to Israel, He said it four times to Himself before He said it to Israel, as it is stated: “Then He saw it and related it, prepared it, and also studied it” and then: “He said to man…” Likewise, “God spoke all these matters” (Exodus 20:1), and then “saying” (Exodus 20:1) to Israel. The Rabbis say: One time Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Toreta came before Rabbi Akiva. [Rabbi Akiva] said to him: ‘Stand and read the Torah.’ He said to them: ‘I did not review the portion,’ and the Rabbis praised him. That is, “then He saw it and related it.” <br>Rabbi Hoshaya said: Anyone who is knowledgeable but lacks fear of sin has nothing, [just like] a carpenter who does not have his tools is not a carpenter. Why? It is because the chains supporting the Torah are the fear of God, as it is stated: “The fear of the Lord, that is his treasure” (Isaiah 33:6).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The beginning of that verse is expounded as a reference to the six orders of Mishna; nevertheless, the true treasure is the fear of God.</i> <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who is knowledgeable in Torah but does not perform, it would have been preferable for him had the placenta overturned and he had not come into the world. That is why it is stated: “He said to man [<i>adam</i>]: Behold, the fear of the Lord, [that is wisdom]” (Job 28:28). <br>Rabbi Ḥiya bar Abba said: What is “Behold, the fear of the Lord…”? God said: ‘If you had good deeds, I will give you reward.’ What reward? Torah, as it is stated: “He said to man: Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and turning away from evil is understanding” (Job 28:28). ‘If you turned away from evil, I will produce from you people who have understanding of the Torah.’ From where do you derive this? From Yokheved and Miriam, when they feared God; as it is written: “The midwives feared God” (Exodus 1:17). Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: The reward for fear is Torah as, from Yokheved, the Holy One blessed be He produced Moses, and he was privileged that the Torah would be ascribed to him, as it is stated: “Remember the Torah of Moses, My servant” (Malachi 3:23), and it is written: “Moses commanded us the Torah” (Deuteronomy 33:4). Miriam, because she distanced herself from evil and from sin, the Holy One blessed be He produced Betzalel from her, and he merited wisdom and understanding. That is what is written: “See, I have called by name Betzalel” (Exodus 31:2), and it is written: “I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge” (Exodus 31:3).
Another matter, “I have called by name Betzalel” is not written here, but rather, “see, I have called.” You find that when Moses ascended On High, the Holy One blessed be He showed him all the vessels of the Tabernacle and said to him: ‘Craft in such and such a manner: “you shall craft a candelabrum” (Exodus 25:31); “you shall craft a table” (Exodus 25:23); “you shall craft an altar” (Exodus 30:1), and so for all the crafting of the Tabernacle. Moses readied to descend [Mount Sinai] under the impression that he would be crafting it. The Holy One blessed be He called him and said to him: ‘Moses, I have made you king; it is not the way of a king to craft anything, but rather, he decrees and others craft. You, too, do not have license to craft anything, but rather, say to them and they will craft it.’ But He did not say to whom he should say.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">God did not tell Moses at that time who would actually craft the Tabernacle and its vessels. </i> Moses said: ‘To whom shall I say?’ He said to him: ‘I will show you.’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He brought him the book of Adam the first man, and showed him all the generations that are destined to stand from Genesis until the revival of the dead, each generation and its kings, each generation and its leaders, each generation and its prophets. He said to him: ‘Each and every one I appointed from that time.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">From the time of creation, each of those individuals was destined for the role he would play in his generation. </i> Likewise, I appointed Betzalel from that time.’ That is, “see, I have called by name Betzalel.”
Another matter, “see, I have called by name Betzalel,” that is what is written: “What was, its name has already been called” (Ecclesiastes 6:10). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The one whom I appointed at the outset so that he would craft the Tabernacle, I have already called him by name.’ What is, “it is known that he is a man”? (Ecclesiastes 6:10). While Adam the first man was still a shapeless mass, the Holy One blessed be He showed him each and every righteous person that was destined to emerge from him. Some were suspended on Adam’s head, some were suspended on his hair, some were suspended on his forehead, some on his eyes, some on his nose, some on his mouth, some on his ear, and some on his earlobes <this is the place of the earrings>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The correlation between a particular person and the location on Adam from which he was suspended depends upon the person’s character and tendencies (see <i>Yefei To’ar</i>). </i> Know that when Job sought to argue with the Holy One blessed be He, and said: “If only I could know and find Him…I would organize my case before Him” (Job 23:3–4), the Holy One blessed be He responded to him: ‘Do You seek to argue with Me? “Where [<i>eifo</i>] were you when I founded the earth?”’ (Job 38:4). What is <i>eifo</i>? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Job, tell me the origins of your soul [<i>haeifa</i>]. From which place was [your soul] suspended, from [Adam’s] head, from his forehead, or from which of his [other] limbs? If you know at what place were the origins of your soul, you may argue with Me.’ That is, “where [<i>eifo</i>] were you…?” <br>The Holy One blessed be He showed [Adam] Abraham. Because he said one matter,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham said: “My Lord God, how shall I know that I shall inherit it” (Genesis 15:8), questioning whether God would fulfill His promise to give him the land. </i> his descendants descended to Egypt and were enslaved in Egypt. He showed him Moses arising and redeeming them. He showed him Joseph supporting the tribes. He showed him Moses anointing prophets. He showed him Samuel anointing kings; Joshua taking Israel into the Land; David laying the foundation for the Temple; Solomon building it; Atalya mother of Ahaziah and her sons detaching the golden nails from the Temple; Yehoyada repairing it; Amon engaging in idol worship; Yoshiya eliminating it; Nebuchadnezzar destroying the Temple; Darius building it; and He showed him Betzalel building the Tabernacle. That is, “see, I have called by name Betzalel.”
Another matter, “see, I have called by name,” this is one of seven people who were called by several names. There were those called by four, such as Elijah; Betzalel, six; Joshua, six; Moses, seven; Mordekhai, two; Daniel, five; Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, four. Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said: Elijah was a Jerusalemite, from among those who sat in the chamber of Hewn Stone, and was from a city in Judah. His property was in two tribes; five portions in Benjamin, as it is stated: “Tzela, HaElef, and the Yevusites, which is Jerusalem [Givat, Kiryat; fourteen cities and their surrounding areas. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin]” (Joshua 18:28), three in Judah, as it is stated: “Tzenan, Ḥadasha, and Migdal Gad” (Joshua 15:37). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Tzenan, as he was a shield [<i>tzina</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Elijah shielded Israel from divine punishment. </i> Ḥadasha, as the Holy One blessed be He will restore it [<i>meḥadesha</i>] in the future; and Migdal Gad, as from there the Holy One blessed be He will emerge and raze [<i>magdid</i>] the foundations of Esau. Elijah was called four names, as it is written: “Yaareshya, Elijah, and Zikhri, the sons of Yeroḥam” (I Chronicles 8:27).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash regards Yaareshya, Elijah, Zikhri, and Yeroḥam to all refer to the same individual. </i> Why was he called these names? It is because when the Holy One blessed be He seeks to shake [<i>leharish</i>] His world, [Elijah] stands and mentions [<i>mazkir</i>] the merit of the ancestors and God has mercy [<i>meraḥem</i>] on His world. <br>Betzalel was called six names and you trace his lineage from the tribe of Judah, as it is stated: “The sons of Judah: Peretz, Ḥetzron, Karmi, Hur, and Shoval, and Re’aya…” (I Chronicles 4:1–2). Ḥetzron is none other than the grandson of Judah, as it is stated: “The sons of Peretz were Ḥetzron and Ḥamul” (Genesis 46:12). And it is written: “After the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb Efrata” (I Chronicles 2:24). Does a person die in a person, that it is written: “After the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb”? Reish Lakish said: What is “after the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb…”? After Ḥetzron died, Caleb consorted with Efrat, namely Miriam, whose name was Efrat. Why was she called that? It is because the children of Israel were fruitful and multiplied [<i>parim veravim</i>] because of her.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Miriam is identified as one of the Israelite midwives in Egypt (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:13). </i> “She bore him Ḥur, Ḥur begot Uri, and Uri begot Betzalel” (I Chronicles 2:19–20). “Re’aya son of Shoval begot Yahat, and Yaḥat begot Aḥumai and Laḥad. These are the families of the Tzoratites” (I Chronicles 4:2). Betzalel, that is what his nation called him. The Holy One blessed be He called him by five names of endearment after the Tabernacle. Re’aya, as the Holy One blessed be He showed [<i>herahu</i>] him to Moses and to all of Israel and said to them: ‘From the beginning I appointed him to build the Tabernacle.’ Shoval, because he built a dovecote [<i>shovakh</i>] for God; this is the Tabernacle, that would stand like a dovecote.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It stood tall, like a dovecote (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: The Holy One blessed be He established a Tabernacle for Israel like a dovecote.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Just as a dovecote protects doves who flock to it, the Israelites would flock to the Tabernacle on the festivals (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Yaḥat, because he imposed fear of Him [<i>ḥitito</i>] upon Israel. Aḥumai, because he united [<i>iḥa</i>] Israel with the Holy One blessed be He, and rendered them like brothers [<i>aḥim</i>] to the Omnipresent. Alternatively, Aḥumai, because he imposed the fear of God upon Israel. Laḥad, because he placed glory and grandeur upon Israel, as the Tabernacle was their glory. Alternatively, Laḥad, because the lowliest of tribes cleaved to him. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Pazi said: You have none greater than the tribe of Judah, and you have no lowlier that the tribe of Dan, as it was from the concubines. And what is written in its regard? “The son of Dan was Ḥushim” (Genesis 46:23).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that Dan had only one son is another reason he was considered of lower status than other tribes (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). Alternatively, the term “son” is written in plural such that a literal rendition of the verse would be: The sons of Dan were Ḥushim. Dan’s only son was referred to in plural as a sign that he was important even though he was from Dan. </i> The Holy One blessed be He said: Let him<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Dan.</i> come and join him,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Judah.</i> so that [people] will not demean him and so there will be no person who is arrogant, because the great and the lowly are equal before the Omnipresent. Betzalel was from Judah and Oholiav from Dan, and he joined him.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Exodus 31:6. </i> <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The great and the lowly are equal. A person should never forsake his strength.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A person should not think that he cannot be strengthened and aided by an individual of humble lineage. </i> The Tabernacle was crafted by these two tribes, and likewise the Temple [was constructed by] Solomon from Judah, and Ḥiram “son of a widowed woman from the tribe of Naphtali” (I Kings 7:14). <br>The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I am your strength.’ Do not forsake your strength or the strength of your fathers, so, too, do not forsake Him, as it is written: “The Almighty shall be your strength [<i>betzarekha</i>]” (Job 22:25). Make Him your strength so that He will be with you in all distress [<i>betzara</i>] that befalls you, as it is stated: “I will be with him in distress” (Psalms 91:15). Alternatively, <i>betzarekha</i>, that if enemies come, I will be against them, as it is stated: “The Almighty shall be your strength [<i>betzarekha</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tzarekha</i> means “your enemies” and therefore the term <i>betzarekha</i> can be understood to mean “against your enemies.”</i> Alternatively, He will become your walls, as <i>betzarekha</i> is nothing other than a wall, just as it says: “The fortification [<i>umivtzar</i>] of your towering walls” (Isaiah 25:12). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘In this world I am a wall for you, and likewise in the future when Zion will be rebuilt, I will become a wall for it,’ as it is stated: “I will be for it, the utterance of the Lord, a wall of fire all around, and I will be in its midst for glory” (Zechariah 2:9), and likewise: “I have called your name, you are Mine” (Isaiah 43:1).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The subsequent verses discuss how God will protect Israel. </i>

Chapter 41

<b>“He gave to Moses, as He concluded speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of Testimony, stone tablets, written with the finger of God” (Exodus 31:18).</b> <br>“He gave to Moses, as He concluded.” Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba began in this way: “With You, Lord, is the righteousness, and with us the shame” (Daniel 9:7). What is the reason that this is so? Rabbi Neḥemya said: Even when we are performing acts of righteousness, we look at our actions and we experience shame. There is no time that we come with demands, other than when we are taking out our tithes, as it is stated: “When you conclude tithing” (Deuteronomy 26:12). What is written at the end? “Look from Your holy abode, from the heavens, [and bless Your people Israel, and the land that You gave us]” (Deuteronomy 26:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The point here is that even when we perform mitzvot we dare not ask for goodness on the basis of our merits. The exception to this is when tithing produce, as this mitzva comes with a guarantee of reward in this world (see <i>Ta’anit</i> 9a) (Maharzu). </i> Rabbi Alexandri said: Great is the power of those who take out tithes, as they transform a curse into a blessing. You find that everywhere that looking<i> </i>is written in the Torah, it is an expression of distress, just as it says: “The Lord looked at the camp of Egypt” (Exodus 14:24). Likewise in Sodom, as it is stated; “He looked over Sodom” (Genesis 19:28), except for this one.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The word looking in the verse regarding tithes (Deuteronomy 26:15) is in the context of blessing. </i> Rabbi Alexandri said: Great is the power of those who take out tithes, as they transform a cursed matter into a blessing, as it is stated: “Look from Your holy abode, from the heavens, and bless Your people Israel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This statement does not seem to add anything to the previously mentioned statement of Rabbi Alexandri, and some commentaries state that its inclusion is a textual error (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: Even when we are looking at our actions we experience shame. How is this manifest? The way of the world is that a person gives his field for sharecropping, and [the sharecropper] provides the seed and provides the labor, and divides it with him equally. But the Holy One blessed be He, may His name be praised and His mention exalted, is not so, but rather, the world and everything that is in it is His, just as it says: “To the Lord is the earth and all it contains” (Psalms 24:1). The land is His, the produce is His, He causes rain to fall and dew to rise to grow them, He protects them, and He does everything. The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘I told you to give me only one-tenth as tithe, one-fiftieth as <i>teruma</i>.’ That is, “with You, Lord, is the righteousness, and with us the shame.” <br>Rabbi Yehuda says: With us the shame and with You the righteousness; Israel was crossing the sea and the silver for the idol of Mikha was crossing the sea, as it is stated: “Trouble will cross the sea” (Zechariah 10:11), and the sea was split before them. That is, “with You, Lord, is the righteousness, and with us the shame.” <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It was befitting for our ancestors to receive the Torah and to say: “Everything that the Lord spoke we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). But was it befitting for them to say: “This is your God, Israel”? (Exodus 32:4). The matter is astonishing! At that moment, Moses was descending from above. Joshua said to him: “There is the sound of battle in the camp” (Exodus 32:17). Moses said to him: “There is not the sound of a cry of valor [<i>gevura</i>]” (Exodus 32:18), [as in]: “It was, when Moses raised his hand, Israel prevailed [<i>vegavar</i>]” (Exodus 17:11), “and there is not the sound of a cry of weakness [<i>ḥalusha</i>]” (Exodus 32:18), [as in:] “Joshua weakened [<i>vayaḥalosh</i>] [Amalek]” (Exodus 17:13). What is “the sound of a cry, I hear”? (Exodus 32:18). It is the sound of cursing and blaspheming that I hear. The members of the Great Assembly stood and explained it: “Even when they made themselves a cast figure of a calf and said: This is your God who took you up from Egypt, and they performed great offenses” (Nehemiah 9:18), is there anything missing?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Would there have been anything missing from the description of this sin, if the final clause had been ommitted? </i> What is “and they performed great offenses”? These are the cursing and blaspheming that were there. After everything they did, the manna should not have fallen; however, what is written? “You did not withhold Your manna from them” (Nehemiah 9:20). That is, “with You, Lord, is the righteousness, and with us the shame.” <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shalom said: That would be sufficient, but furthermore, they would take the manna and sacrifice it before the idol,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It would be sufficiently shameful that Israel sinned while God was performing miracles for them and giving them the manna; but they did even worse than that, and used the manna itself for idolatry. </i> as it is stated: “My bread that I gave you, fine flour and oil and honey that I fed you, you placed it before them for a pleasing aroma” (Ezekiel 16:19), but it would again fall on the next day. That is, “with You, Lord, is the righteousness.” <br>Another matter, “with You, Lord, is the righteousness,” Rabbi Levi said: Israel was standing below and hewing an idol to anger their Maker, as it is written: “He took it from their hand and he fashioned it with a sculpting tool” (Exodus 32:4), and the Holy One blessed be He was sitting above and hewing the tablets for them to grant them life, as it is stated: “He gave to Moses, as He concluded [speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God].” That is, “with You, Lord, is the righteousness.”
Another matter, “He gave to Moses,” that is what is written: “A person’s giving expands for him [and will bring him before great men]” (Proverbs 18:16). A gift that a person gives from his own [possessions] expands for him. There was an incident involving Avin the deceiver <as it is written in the scroll of Esther in the midrash><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This incident is not recorded in <i>Esther Rabba</i> but is found elsewhere in the midrash (see <i>Tanḥuma, Re’eh</i> 5; <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 5:4; see here in <i>Etz Yosef</i>). Avin would create the impression that he was not donating to charity, and would then clandestinely match the sum donated by everyone else. When the Sages discovered the truth they seated him in their midst.</i> until they took him and seated them in their midst, to realize: “A man’s giving expands for him.” <br>Another matter, “a person’s giving expands for him,” this is Abraham. When he pursued the kings,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is referring to when Abraham pursued the four kings and defeated them in battle, thus gaining control of the residents and possessions of Sodom that they had looted; see Genesis chapter 14. </i> the king of Sodom emerged to greet him and said to him: “Give me the people and take the possessions for yourself” (Genesis 14:21). Abraham said: “I have raised my hand to the Lord…not a thread or a sandal strap” (Genesis 14:22–23). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You say: “Not a thread,” as you live, with that same expression I will laud your descendants, as it is stated: “Your lips are like a scarlet thread” (Song of Songs 4:3). You said: “Or a sandal strap,” with that expression, I will laud your descendants, as it is stated: “How fair are your feet in sandals”’ (Song of Songs 7:2). That is, “a man’s giving expands for him.” <br>Another matter, “a man’s giving expands for him,” this is Israel. When Moses said to them to bring a contribution for the Tabernacle, what is written? “They brought him more contributions each morning” (Exodus 36:3). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: In two mornings they brought all the materials [needed for] the Tabernacle. What did they merit? That the Holy One blessed be He would expand their boundaries, as it is stated: “When the Lord your God will expand your boundary” (Deuteronomy 12:20); of each and every one of them. That is, “a man’s giving expands for him.” <br>Rabbi Yonatan says: Three matters were given as a gift [<i>matana</i>]: The rains, the lights, and the Torah. Rain, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “I will provide [<i>venatati</i>] your rains in their time” (Leviticus 26:4). Lights, from where is it derived? As it is written: “God set [<i>vayiten</i>] them in the firmament of the heavens” (Genesis 1:17). Torah, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “He gave [<i>vayiten</i>] to Moses […the two tablets of Testimony].” Rabbi Azarya says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Peace, too, as it is stated: “I will provide [<i>venatati</i>] peace in the land” (Leviticus 26:6).
Another matter, “He gave to Moses,” that is what is written: “For the Lord grants wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding” (Proverbs 2:6). Great is wisdom, but greater than it are knowledge and understanding. That is, “for the Lord grants wisdom,” but to those whom He loves, “from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” Rabbi Yitzḥak and Rabbi Levi, one of them said: To what is the matter comparable? To a wealthy man who had a son. His son came from school and saw a tray before his father. His father took one piece and gave it to him. What did his son do? He said to him: ‘I want only from the one that is in your mouth.’ What did he do? He gave it to him. Why? Because he loves him, he gave him what was in his mouth. That is, “for the Lord grants wisdom,” and to anyone whom He loves more, “from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” And one said: It is analogous to a wealthy man who had a son who came from school, and he gave him a portion. His son said to him: ‘I want only from the biscuit that is in your mouth.’ He took and gave him from his mouth. That is, “for the Lord grants wisdom,” but, “from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The difference between the two analogies is as follows: In the first analogy, the food in the father’s mouth is the same as the food on the tray, but the son wants it because it is in the father’s mouth. In the second analogy, it is a different type of food than that originally given to the son, and served to the others at the meal. This represents Torah, which is different than other areas of wisdom (Rabbi David Luria). Thus, although all wisdom is from God, as expressed in the phrase “for the Lord grants wisdom,” Torah is unique and is considered to have been shared by God in a more intimate and direct fashion, as expressed in the phrase “from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.” </i> <br>Another matter, “for the Lord grants wisdom,” you find that when Israel stood at Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, they requested to hear the commandments from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He. Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen ben Ḥama said: Israel made two requests of the Holy One blessed be He; to see His likeness and to hear the commandments from His mouth, as it is written: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth” (Song of Songs 1:2). Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen ben Ḥama said: Does one accede to every request of a fool? Yet it was known and revealed before the Holy One blessed be He that after forty days Israel was destined to craft the calf. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If I do not accede to their request, they are destined to say: Did we not demand through Moses that the Holy One blessed be He show us His likeness and speak with us?’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘So they will not have recourse to say that it is because we did not hear from His mouth and did not see His likeness that we crafted a god for ourselves.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They could have said that since they only heard from God through an intermediary, Moses, when Moses seemed to have disappeared they therefore created the Golden Calf in his place. </i> Rather, what will I do? I will show them My likeness and speak to them mouth to mouth,’ just as it says: “God spoke these matters, saying” (Exodus 20:1). That is, “for the Lord grants wisdom.” “He gave to Moses,” that is, “from His mouth come knowledge and understanding,” as the Torah was given to them from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He.
Another matter, “He gave to Moses,” that is what is written: “You gave me the shield of Your salvation” (Psalms 18:36). It is speaking of Israel, who place their trust in the Holy One blessed be He, and He shields them, as it is written: “He is a shield for all who take refuge in Him” (Psalms 18:31). “Your right hand assists me” (Psalms 18:36), this is Torah, as it is written: “From His right, a fiery law to them” (Deuteronomy 33:2). “Your humility makes me grow great” (Psalms 18:36); Is there anyone more humble than the Holy One blessed be He? Rabbi Abba bar Aḥa said: The way of the world is that the disciple sits before his teacher, and when he finishes, the disciple says to the teacher: ‘I have exhausted you,’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The disciple apologizes and thanks the teacher for having devoted so much time and energy to him. When God gave the Torah to Israel, He thanked them for their time, as it were (see <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 18). </i> and the entire matter as it is written in <i>Bereshit Rabba</i> until: “He lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, three men” (Genesis 18:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">God came to visit Abraham after his circumcision, and as it were, Abraham was sitting and God was standing. This is a sign of God’s great humility (<i>Bereishit Rabba</i> 48:1). </i> Is there anyone more humble than this? That is, “Your humility makes me grow great.” Rabbi Simon said: Come and see what is written: “The men arose from there and looked toward Sodom…” (Genesis 18:16). It should have said only: The Lord was still standing before Abraham.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The verse a few lines later that continues the story after God speaks states: “Abraham was still standing before the Lord” (Genesis 18:22), but since it was God who was standing and Abraham who was sitting, it would have been more accurate to say: The Lord was still standing before Abraham. </i> It is, rather, a scribal emendation.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is stated in a manner more befitting God’s honor. </i> That is, “Your humility makes me grow great.” <br>Another matter, “Your humility makes me grow great,” ben Azzai said: Come and see the humility that the Holy One blessed be He possesses. Flesh and blood <as it is written there, etc.>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to <i>Bereshit Rabba </i>1:12. The midrash there notes that God inserts a reference to Himself in the Torah only after mentioning creation. </i> <br>Another matter, “Your humility makes me grow great” – the way of the world is that a flesh and blood king, as long as people are completely loyal to him, he attends to them to give them gifts, to distribute stipends to them, and he attends to their lives. But if they, God forbid, rebel against him, he does not attend to them for any matter in the world, and he halts their stipends. Why? Because they denied his kingdom. But the Holy One blessed be He is not so; rather, they engage in angering Him below, and He engages above in giving them the Torah, which is entirely life, as it is stated: “He gave to Moses, as He concluded.” Is there anyone more humble than this? That is, “Your humility makes me grow great.”
Another matter, “He gave to Moses,” the Rabbis say: Had Israel performed that act before the tablets had been given to Moses, they would not have descended in his hand. Rabbi Levi said: It was after they performed that act that the Holy One blessed be He gave Moses the tablets, as it is written: “He gave to Moses, as He concluded speaking with him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">He concluded speaking with him just before he descended, while the calf was crafted the day before he descended.</i> <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: What is “speaking with him”? This is analogous to a disciple whose teacher taught him Torah. Until he taught it to him, the teacher would recite it and he would repeat after him. After he has taught it to him, his teacher says to him: ‘Come, let you and I recite it [together].’ So too, when Moses ascended heavenward, he began reciting the Torah after his Creator. Once he learned it, He said: ‘Come, let you and I recite it.’ That is: “To speak with him.” <br>What is “as He concluded”? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Anyone who expresses words of Torah but they are not pleasant to their listeners like a bride is pleasant to her husband, it would be preferable for him had he not said them. Why? When the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah to Israel, it was beloved to them as a bride [<i>kalla</i>] who is beloved to her spouse. From where is that derived? It is, as it is stated: “He gave to Moses, as He concluded [<i>kekhaloto</i>].” <br>Rabbi Levi said that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Just as this bride is adorned with twenty-four kinds of ornaments, so too, a Torah scholar must be proficient in twenty-four books.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The books of the Bible.</i> <br><i>Kekhaloto</i>, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Just as this bride [<i>kalla</i>], all the days that she is in her father’s home, she secludes herself and no man recognizes her, but when she comes to enter her wedding canopy she reveals her face as though to say: ‘Anyone who knows testimony in my regard let him come and testify about me,’<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Due to her life of modesty, she is unafraid that anyone will have any testimony that she committed misdeeds. </i> so too, a Torah scholar must be as modest as the bride, but renowned for his good deeds like a bride who makes herself known. That is, “He gave to Moses <i>kekhaloto</i>.”
Another matter, “He gave to Moses,” Rabbi Abahu said: All forty days that Moses spent above, he would study Torah and forget. He said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, I have forty days and I do not know anything.’ What did the Holy One blessed be He do? After he completed forty days, the Holy One blessed be He gave him the Torah as a gift [<i>matana</i>], as it is stated: “He gave [<i>vayiten</i>] to Moses.” <br>Did Moses learn the entire Torah? It is written regarding the Torah: “Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea” (Job 11:9), and Moses learned it in forty days? Rather, the Holy One blessed be He taught Moses the fundamental principles [<i>kelalim</i>]. That is, “as He concluded [<i>kekhaloto</i>] speaking with him.” <br>“The two tablets of Testimony,” what is the reason for two tablets? They correspond to the heavens and earth. They correspond to the bride and the groom. They correspond to the two attendants.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The groomsman and the maid of honor who attend to the groom and the bride respectively.</i> They correspond to this world and the World to Come. <br>“Two tablets [<i>luḥot</i>] of Testimony,” Rabbi Ḥanina said: <i>Luḥot </i>is written without a <i>vav</i>, as one was not larger than the other.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Because the word <i>luḥot</i> is written without any <i>vav</i>s, it can be vocalized <i>luḥat</i>, which is a singular term. This is in order to indicate that they were identical.</i> <br>“Stone tablets,” – why of stone? It is because most of the punishments in the Torah are by stoning. That is why it is stated: “Stone tablets.” Alternatively, “stone tablets,” due to the merit of Jacob who was called stone, as it is stated: “From there the shepherd, the stone of Israel” (Genesis 49:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Jacob is the foundation stone of the Jewish people.</i> Alternatively, stone tablets,” anyone who does not render his life like this stone<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Anyone who does not live a hard, demanding life.</i> will not merit the Torah.
<b> “The tablets were the work of God and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets” (Exodus 32:16).</b> <br>“The tablets were the work of God.” Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Each and every day, a Divine Voice emerges from Mount Ḥorev and proclaims: ‘Woe unto the creations for the affront to the Torah, as anyone who does not regularly engage in the Torah is ostracized from before the Holy One blessed be He,’ as it is stated: “The tablets were the work of God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">God’s occupation, as it were, is involvement in Torah, and therefore anyone who ignores Torah ignores God (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>; see <i>Tanḥuma</i>, <i>Ki Tisa</i> 16). </i> <br>“Engraved [<i>ḥarut</i>] on the tablets.” Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yirmeya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda says: Do not read it as <i>ḥarut</i>, but rather as <i>ḥerut</i> – freedom from the exiles. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Freedom from the angel of death. The Rabbis say: Freedom from suffering. Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili said: If the angel of death were to come and say before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You created me in this world for naught,’ He would say: ‘I granted you dominion over every nation in the world except for this nation, to whom I granted freedom.’ That is, “<i>ḥarut</i> on the tablets.” <br><b>“The people saw that Moses tarried in descending from the mountain, and the people assembled around Aaron and said to him: Rise, make us a god that will go before us, because this man Moses, who took us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him” (Exodus 32:1).</b> <br>“The people saw that Moses tarried [<i>boshesh</i>].” What is “tarried [<i>boshesh</i>]”? Six hours had passed [<i>ba’u shesh</i>] and he had not descended. Why? It is because he had stipulated to them: In forty days I will bring you the Torah. When six hours passed [on the fortieth day] and Moses had not descended, immediately, “the people assembled around Aaron.” The Rabbis say: The accuser found his opportunity at that moment, as Moses was seen suspended between the heavens and earth, and they were pointing at him with a finger and saying: “Because this man Moses.” <br>At that moment, Ḥur confronted them and said to them: ‘You fools,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, you whose heads were severed at the neck.</i> do you not recall what miracles the Holy One blessed be He performed on your behalf?’ Immediately, they arose against him and killed him. They surrounded Aaron, as it is stated: “The people assembled around Aaron.” They said to him: ‘Just as we did to that one, so we will do to you.’ When Aaron saw that, he was afraid, as it is stated: “Aaron saw and he built an altar [<i>mizbe’aḥ</i>] before it [<i>lefanav</i>]” (Exodus 32:5). What is <i>mizbe’aḥ</i>? Due to the one who was slaughtered before him [<i>min hazavuaḥ shelefanav</i>]. <br>Another matter, “he built an altar,” they sought to build an altar with him, but he did not allow them to do so. He said to them: ‘Allow me, and I will build it myself, as it is not in keeping with the honor due the altar for another to build it.’ But Aaron intended to delay matters. He said: ‘By the time I build it by myself, Moses will descend.’ He built it, but Moses did not descend. Immediately, they arose early the next day, as the prophet cries out: “However, they arose early and corrupted all their exploits” (Zephaniah 3:7). <br>“The people sat to eat and drink, and they rose to revel” (Exodus 32:6) in idol worship. Wherever you find sitting [<i>yeshiva</i>], you find a mishap, as we found regarding the generation of the Dispersion, as it is stated: “They found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they settled [<i>vayeshvu</i>] there” (Genesis 11:2). What mishap was there? “They said: Come let us build us a city” (Genesis 11:4). “They sat [<i>vayeshvu</i>] to eat bread” (Genesis 37:25), and it is written: “They sold Joseph” (Genesis 37:28). “Israel settled [<i>vayeshev</i>] in the Shitim” (Numbers 25:1). What mishap was there? “The people began to engage in licentiousness with the daughters of Moav” (Numbers 25:1). What was their end? “Those who died [in the plague were twenty-four thousand]” (Numbers 25:9). Here, too, it is sitting, [implying] idol worship: “The people sat to eat….” The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘They rose to revel in idol worship, and you are sitting here? “Descend!”’ (Exodus 32:7). <br>At that moment, Moses sought to descend, but he encountered angels of destruction. He feared them and he did not descend, as it is written: “For I was in dread due to the wrath and the fury” (Deuteronomy 9:19). What did Moses do? He went and grasped the [Divine] throne, as it is stated: “He grasps the surface of His throne and spreads His cloud over it” (Job 26:9); the Holy One blessed be He spread [His cloud] and protected him. He said: “Rise, descend quickly from here” (Deuteronomy 9:12). [Moses] said: ‘I am afraid.’ Come and see how potent iniquities are. In the past he had overcome them, but now he feared them.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In the past Moses had disputed with and overcome the angels, but now he was afraid of them (see Maharzu). </i> “For I was in dread due to the wrath and the fury,” five angels of destruction were there: Wrath, fury, anger, destruction, and annihilation. At that moment, the three patriarchs came, and overcame three of them. Wrath and fury remained. Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, please, arise from Your Throne of Glory and overcome one, and I [will overcome] one,’ as it is stated: “Arise, Lord, in Your wrath” (Psalms 7:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This is understood to mean: ‘Arise, Lord, and hold back Your wrath’ – i.e. the angel of wrath, one of the angels of destruction that remained. </i> And I will overcome fury, as it is stated: “He said to destroy them, had it not been for Moses, His chosen one, who stood before Him in the breach to turn back His fury” (Psalms 106:23). Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Descend, it is a demotion for you.’ He said to Him: ‘Why?’ [God said:] “For your people…have acted corruptly” (Exodus 32:7). <br>Moses said to Him: ‘Now You are calling them my people; they are only Your people. “Relent from Your enflamed wrath and reconsider the evil for Your people”’ (Exodus 32:12). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: Moses did not move from prayer until the Holy One blessed be He called them His people, as it is stated: “The Lord reconsidered the evil that He had spoken of doing to His people” (Exodus 32:14). <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘In this world, because the evil inclination is in them, they craft idols. But in the future, I will uproot the evil inclination from within them and I will grant them a heart of flesh,’ just as it says: “I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh” (Ezekiel 36:26).

Chapter 42

<b>“The Lord spoke to Moses: Go descend; for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have acted corruptly” (Exodus 32:7).</b> <br>“The Lord spoke to Moses: Go descend” – Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba began: “Clouds and wind but no rain, [is a man who glories in a false gift.] With patience, a commander is enticed” (Proverbs 25:14–15). One who says that he will give a gift to another but does not give it, to what is he comparable? To clouds, wind, and lightning that come, but rains do not fall. This was the generation of the wilderness. When they were in Sinai, they were six hundred thousand elders, a like number of young men, a like number of lads, and a like number of women.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states that the children of Israel were “six hundred thousand men on foot besides children” (Exodus 12:37). The midrash asserts that the words “men on foot” serve to teach that there were a like number of elders, who could not travel on foot, as well as a like number of youth, who were not yet “men,” and a like number of women. </i> When they arrived at Sinai and accepted the kingship of the Holy One blessed be He upon them, and they called out in a single voice: “Everything that the Lord spoke, we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7); that was a voice that was a [strong, impressive] voice.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Comparable to the impressive sound of thunder that had accompanied the giving of the Torah. </i> When they arrived at the wilderness, they violated everything and corrupted their actions. <br>When the Holy One blessed be He saw this, He said to Moses: “Go descend, for your people…have acted corruptly [<i>shiḥet</i>].” <i>Shiḥet </i>means nothing other than that they corrupted their actions, just as it says: “They behaved corruptly [<i>shiḥet</i>], not from Him; His children, it is their blemish” (Deuteronomy 32:5). Not only did they engage in idol worship, but they also engaged in forbidden sexual relations and bloodshed. The revelry [<i>seḥok</i>] stated here,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">“They stood to revel [<i>letzaḥek</i>]” (Exodus 32:6).</i> is nothing other than idol worship,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash does not find it necessary to prove that the term <i>seḥok</i> can refer to idolatry, as it is clear from the context of the verse in Exodus that the people engaged in idolatry (see Maharzu). </i> forbidden sexual relations, and bloodshed. From where is it derived that <i>seḥok </i>is bloodshed? As it is stated: “Let the lads arise and play [<i>visaḥaku</i>] before us” (II Samuel 2:14). From where is it derived [that the term<i> seḥok</i> can refer to] forbidden sexual relations? As it is stated: “The Hebrew slave [whom you brought to us] came to me to mock [<i>letzaḥek</i>] me…” (Genesis 39:17). There was no one there greater than Ḥur, and they killed him. This is the approach of Abba, the expounder.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is all stated by Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba, citing his father. </i> <br>Another matter: “[The Lord spoke [<i>vaydaber</i>] to Moses:] go descend,” in anger. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He spoke harsh words against him. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The speech [<i>dibur</i>] stated here is nothing other than harsh words, just as it says: “The man, lord of the land, spoke [<i>diber</i>] harshly with us” (Genesis 42:30). At that moment, Moses saw the ministering angels that were rising and seeking to go out and to harm all of Israel. Moses said: If I forsake Israel and descend, they will never recover. I will not move from here until I ask for mercy on their behalf. Immediately, he began speaking in their defense. He said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘I have a claim to advance in their favor.’ He said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, remember in their regard that when You sought to give the Torah to the children of Esau, and they did not accept it, Israel accepted it,’ as it is stated: “All the people answered together [and said: Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform]” (Exodus 19:8). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘They transgressed regarding the performance,’ as it is stated: “They have quickly deviated from the path…” (Exodus 32:8). He said to Him: ‘Remember in their regard that when I went as Your emissary to Egypt and said Your name to them, they immediately believed and prostrated themselves to Your name,’ as it is stated: “The people believed” (Exodus 4:31), and immediately, “they bowed and prostrated themselves” (Exodus 4:31). He said to him: ‘They transgressed regarding the prostrating,’ as it is stated: “They prostrated themselves to it” (Exodus 32:8). ‘He said to Him: ‘Remember their young men whom I sent and they sacrificed offerings before You,’ as it is stated: “He sent the young men of the children of Israel [and they offered burnt offerings and they sacrificed feast offerings]” (Exodus 24:5). He said to him: ‘They transgressed regarding the sacrifice,’ as it is stated: “They sacrificed to it” (Exodus 32:8). He said to Him: ‘Remember for them what You said at Sinai: “I am the Lord your God”’ (Exodus 20:2). He said to him: ‘They violated it,’ as it is stated: “They said: This is your god” (Exodus 32:8). That is, “clouds and wind but no rain” (Proverbs 25:14). Moses immediately voided the punishment. That is, “with patience, [a commander is enticed]” (Proverbs 25:15).
The Holy One blessed be He began providing Moses with paths for him to ask for mercy on their behalf. From where is this derived? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Above it is written, “Go descend,” and thereafter, it says: “The Lord said [<i>vayomer</i>] to Moses: I have seen this people” (Exodus 32:9). Saying [<i>amira</i>] is nothing other than gentle words. This is like a person who has a grudge against another and seeks to reconcile with him, and he says to him: ‘Say [<i>emor</i>] to me what I did to you that led you to do so.’ When Moses heard gentle words from the Holy One blessed be He, he began asking for mercy on their behalf, as it is stated: “Moses implored…” (Exodus 32:11). <br>“Go descend” – [Moses] said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, yesterday You said to me: “Ascend, you and Aaron with you” (Exodus 19:24), and likewise, “to Moses He said, ascend to the Lord” (Exodus 24:1), and now You say: “Go descend”?’ He said to him: ‘It is not for your honor that you ascend to here, but rather due to the honor of My children. I said to their grandfather: “Behold, angels of God were ascending and descending on it [<i>bo</i>]” (Genesis 28:12). What is <i>bo</i>? Rather, this is what I said to him: When your descendants will be righteous, they are elevated in the world and ascend, and their emissaries are elevated with them. When they descend, they and their emissaries are in descent.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the term <i>bo</i>, which can be translated as “through him,” is interpreted as referring not to the ladder but to Jacob himself and his descendants. </i> “Go descend” – why? “For your people…have acted corruptly.” He said to him: ‘Because they sinned, you and they are in descent.’
Another matter: “Go descend” – Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Moses was ostracized and rebuked.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He was distanced from God and sent down from the mountain, like one who is sent away in shame from a human court. </i> “Descend” is nothing other than ostracism. From where do you derive this? When Joseph’s brothers sold him and they went to console their father, he was not consoled. They said:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The brothers said to each other. </i> It was Judah who did all these things to us, for had he not sought it, we would not have sold him. Just as he said to us: ‘Do not kill him,’ and we heeded him, had he said: ‘Do not sell him,’ we would have heeded him. Instead, he said to us: “Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites” (Genesis 37:27). They stood and ostracized him, as it is stated: “It was at that time, Judah descended from his brothers” (Genesis 38:1). It should have said only: “Judah went”; he was in descent from his brothers.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The reason it states “Judah descended” is to indicate that he did not merely leave. His brothers stripped him of his elevated status and ostracized him. </i> Just as “descended [<i>vayered</i>]” that is stated there connotes ostracism, so too, “descend [<i>red</i>]” that is written here connotes ostracism. This is analogous to a province that sent an emissary to crown the king. Before he arrived, the residents of the province overturned the idols and stoned the images [of the king]. The prominent leaders of the province wrote to the king.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">They informed him of what had occurred. </i> The missives entered before the emissary entered to crown the king. The king said to him…<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The text of the midrash does not include the end of the sentence, but the point is that the king turned back the emissary and informed him that he would not be seen due to the disloyal conduct of the residents of his province. </i> <br>“Your people…have acted corruptly” – were they Moses’s people? Rather, that is what the verse said: “Woe to them, as they have wandered from Me; plunder upon them, as they rebelled against Me. I would redeem them, but they have spoken lies about Me” (Hosea 7:13). They were separating themselves from Me, as it is stated: “Woe to them, as they have wandered from Me.” Is there a person who exchanges a good item for a bad item? A person before whom they place gems and coal, would he forsake the gems and take the coal? But they forsake the living of the world<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The true, living God, who gives life to the entire world. </i> and opt for the dead, as it is stated: “They have eyes, but do not see” (Psalms 115:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">In worshipping the golden calf, the people chose an inanimate object over God. </i> “Plunder upon them” – calamity is destined to befall them. “But they have spoken lies about Me” – what lies did they speak about the Holy One blessed be He? Rabbi Akiva expounded: They said: Was He engaged with us? It was with Himself that He was engaged. He redeemed Himself; He did not redeem us, as it is stated: “Nations and their gods from before Your people, whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt” (II Samuel 7:23). The Rabbis say: “This is your god [that took you out of Egypt]” (Nehemiah 9:18) – it redeemed us. Rabbi Ḥagai ben Elazar says: It is not written here, “this is your god,” but rather, “these are your gods” (Exodus 32:4) – they included Him with them and said: God and the calf redeemed us. They lie about Me; [thus,] “I would redeem them, but they have spoken lies about Me.” I, too, say that they are not My people. That is why it is stated: “For your people…have acted corruptly.”
Another matter: “Go descend”; Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “I will distress the people” (Zephaniah 1:17) – this is Moses; “and they will walk like the blind” (Zephaniah 1:17) – these are Israel. Why? “Because they sinned against the Lord” (Zephaniah 1:17), as they said: “These are your gods, Israel” (Exodus 32:4). “Their blood will be spilled like dust” (Zephaniah 1:17), as it is stated: “Pass to-and-fro from gate to gate in the camp, [and each man slay his brother, and each man his neighbor, and each man his relative]” (Exodus 32:27). “And their flesh [<i>ulḥumam</i>] like dung” (Zephaniah 1:17), as they were killed and their flesh was cast away like dung. Rabbi Levi said: In Arabia, they call flesh <i>laḥma</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated as proof that the relatively obscure term <i>ulḥumam</i> in the verse means flesh. </i> <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: When the Holy One blessed be He said to him, “Go descend,” Moses’s face blackened, and he became like a blind man due to the troubles, and he did not know from which place to descend. The ministering angels sought to kill him.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">They were jealous that the Torah had been given to Moses to transmit to human beings rather than given to the angels. </i> They said: ‘This is the time to kill him.’ The Holy One blessed be He knew what the ministering angels sought to do to him. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo, in the name of Rabbi Ḥanan bar Yosef, in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Aivu: The Holy One blessed be He opened a small opening for him beneath His throne of honor and said: “Go descend,” as it is stated: “The Lord said to me: Rise, descend quickly from here” (Deuteronomy 9:12). Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai: When Moses came to descend, the ministering angels came to kill him. What did he do? He grasped the throne of the Holy One blessed be He, and the Holy One blessed be He spread His garment over him so they would not harm him, as it is stated: “He grasps the surface of His throne and spreads [<i>parshez</i>] His cloud over it” (Job 26:9). What is <i>parshez</i>? It is an acrostic for: He spread [<i>paras</i>], the Merciful [<i>raḥum</i>] Almighty [<i>Shadai</i>], the aura [<i>ziv</i>] of His cloud over him.
Another matter: “Go descend [<i>red</i>]” – Rabbi Meir says: They require discipline [<i>mardut</i>]. From where is it derived that this is what He said to him? You know it from what the Holy One blessed be He said to him, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: I have seen this people and behold, it is a stiff-necked people” (Exodus 32:9). A person does not say that so-and-so is stiff-necked unless he requires discipline. The Rabbis say: What is “go descend”? They require discipline. This supports Rabbi Meir. Know that it is so; come and see that when Moses descended, what did he say to them? “Moses stood at the gate of the camp and said: Whoever is for the Lord, [to me].… And he said to them: So said the Lord, God of Israel: [Each man, place his sword upon his thigh. Pass to and fro from gate to gate in the camp and each man slay his brother and each man his neighbor and each man his relative]” (Exodus 32:26–27). Where do you find that He had said that to him? “Go descend.” What is “descend”? They require discipline. <br>Another matter: “Go descend” – Rabbi Avin said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: Do not consider it grave that I said to you “go descend” from here, as two, three times I descended, as it were, from Heaven to earth in order to see the corruption of the people, as it is stated: “The Lord descended to see the city and the tower” (Genesis 11:5); “Come let us descend [and confound their language there]” (Genesis 11:7);<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">These two verses are in the context of the Tower of Babel.</i> “I will descend and see” (Genesis 18:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This is in the context of the destruction of Sodom.</i> You, too, “go descend” – it is sufficient for a servant to be equal to his Maker. When Moses saw this, he said: There is no forgiveness.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Upon hearing that God compared the people to those who created the Tower of Babel and to the Sodomites, Moses despaired of the possibility of forgiveness for Israel. </i> The Holy One blessed be He knew what was in Moses’s heart and called to him to placate him. He said: ‘Did I not already say to you when you were at the bush what they are destined to do,’ as it is stated: “The Lord said: I have seen [<i>rao ra’iti</i>]” (Exodus 3:7). The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘You see a single sighting, but I see two sightings. You see them coming to Sinai and receiving My Torah, but I see that after I come to Sinai to give them the Torah, and I return in My chariot drawn by four animals, they will look at it and take one of them and anger Me with it, as it is stated: “The face of an ox to the left of the four of them” (Ezekiel 1:10). They will anger me with it, as it is stated: “They exchanged their Glory for the form of bull.” (Psalms 106:20). <br>Alternatively: “I have seen [<i>rao ra’iti</i>] [the affliction of My people]” (Exodus 3:7) – what is “the affliction of My people”? This is the congregation of the calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Some commentaries (see, e.g., Maharzu) substitute the word sound [<i>kol</i>] for congregation [<i>kahal</i>]. Thus, the midrash connects the phrase “the sound of a cry [<i>kol anot</i>] do I hear” (Exodus 32:18) with the “affliction [<i>oni</i>]” God heard when the Israelites were in Egypt. In any event, the point is that God redeemed Israel from Egypt despite knowing that they would commit the sin of the golden calf. </i> <i>Rao ra’iti</i>, this is the sighting that was there, and this is the sighting that is here.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash connects the God’s seeing the affliction of the Israelites in Egypt with His seeing that the people were stiff-necked, stated in context of the sin of the golden calf (see Exodus 32:9). Here too, the point is that God redeemed Israel from Egypt despite knowing that they would commit the sin of the golden calf. All this is meant to assuage Moses’ fears that Israel could not be forgiven. </i>
“Go descend, for your people…have acted corruptly” – it is not written here, “the people,” but rather, “your people.” Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, since when are they my people?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘They are your people. When they were still in Egypt I said to you: “I will take out My hosts, My people” (Exodus 7:4). I said to you not to mix the mixed multitude with them. You, who were humble and upright, said to Me: One always accepts penitents. But I knew what they were destined to do; I had said to you, no, but I performed your will.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Originally God said not to accept the mixed multitude, but He then acquiesced to Moses’ request that they be accepted, due to Moses’ argument (see Rabbi David Luria). </i> It is they who crafted the calf, as they were idolaters; it is they who crafted it and caused My people to sin.’ See what is written: It is not written here, “this is our God,” but rather, “this is your god, [Israel]” (Exodus 32:4), as the proselytes who ascended with Moses, it was they who crafted it, and said to Israel: “This is your god, [Israel].” That is why the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Go descend, for your people…have acted corruptly.”
It is not written here, “they abandoned [<i>averu</i>] the path that I commanded them,” but rather, “they have quickly deviated [<i>saru</i>] from the path” (Exodus 32:8). When they were in Sinai they were lilies and roses; now they have become foul [<i>saryut</i>], they became liars. They did not spend even one or two hours,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">They did not remain loyal to God for even a short time. </i> but they deviated immediately. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: They were with the Holy One blessed be He for eleven days, and for twenty-nine days they were calculating how to craft the calf, as it is written: “Eleven days from Ḥorev” (Deuteronomy 1:2). And then they came to the path [<i>derekh</i>] of Esau – “via [<i>derekh</i>] Mount Seir” (Deuteronomy 1:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Esau dwelled in Seir (see Genesis 36:8–9) and is therefore sometimes called Seir. </i> Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: They were with the Holy One blessed be He for twenty-nine days, and for eleven days they were calculating how to craft the calf, as it is written: “Eleven days from Ḥorev via [<i>derekh</i>] Mount Seir,” that they performed an act of Seir.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">They acted like Esau for eleven days in that they planned on crafting the golden calf. </i> <br>Another matter: “Mount Seir” – just as Esau cursed and blasphemed, they too were cursing and blaspheming before the idol. Just as Esau worshipped idols, they too did so. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai says: They were with the Holy One blessed be He for one day. From where is this derived? It is as Micah explicates: “Yesterday, My people arose as an enemy” (Micah 2:8). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Yesterday you said: “Everything that the Lord spoke, we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), and today: “This is your god Israel” (Exodus 32:4)?’ Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: Two days, as it is stated: “My people has forgotten Me for days without number” (Jeremiah 2:32). How many are days? Two.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">This is the minimum number that can be implied by the plural term days. </i> Rabbi Yona said: The source is from another verse, as it is stated: “They seek Me daily [<i>yom yom</i>]” (Isaiah 58:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is understood to mean that they sought God for two days, as the term day [<i>yom</i>] is stated twice. </i>
Another matter: “They have quickly deviated” (Exodus 32:8) – Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: You took the wrong path at the outset. A person who sets out on the path walks two or three <i>mil</i> and errs in the third. Does he err in the first? So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: Could you not have strayed on the second or the third, that [you strayed] on the first? This is astonishing. Rabbi Meir says: It was not even one day. Rather, as they were standing at Sinai they said with their mouths: “We will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7), but their hearts were directed to idol worship, as it is stated: “But they deceived Him with their mouth” (Psalms 78:36). <br>Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Idi: “I saw, and, behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 9:16) – it was regarding the Lord your God that you sinned.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">It was not simply a transgression, but rather, a sin regarding their very faith in Him.</i> The Holy One blessed be He said: I gave you the Ten Commandments for your honor: “You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal” (Exodus 20:13), and so with all of them. Did you have to sin only with the one regarding Me, as it is stated: “I saw, and, behold, you had sinned against the Lord” (Deuteronomy 9:16)? This is astonishing. <br>Rabbi Abbahu said: “Eleven [<i>aḥad asar</i>] days from Ḥorev” (Deuteronomy 1:2) – in the one that is special [<i>meyuḥad</i>] among the ten [<i>asara</i>] you sinned; regarding My name, which is one and is the beginning of all the commandments: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2). <br>Another matter: “They have quickly deviated” (Exodus 32:8) – Rabbi Yona said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Any prophet who stood, would say the prophecy of another. Why would he say the words of another? It was in order to confirm his prophecy. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: He would relate only to his own prophecy, except for Moses, who said all the words of the prophets and his own. Anyone who would prophesy, it was based on the prophecy of Moses. He said all of the commandments, except for two that the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel with His mouth: “I am [the Lord your God]” (Exodus 20:3) and “you shall not have [other gods before Me]” (Exodus 20:2). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Did you have to sin only with what I commanded you?’ <br>Rabbi Shimon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: This is analogous to a king who betrothed a noblewoman with two gems that he gave her directly from his hand to hers, and he then sent another eight by means of his emissary. While she was cavorting with her paramour, she lost the two gems that the king had given her. When the king discovered that she lost them, he expelled her from his home. Her attendant came to placate the king. He said: ‘My lord the king, when will you find one as praiseworthy and beautiful as her?’ The king said: ‘Heavens! I gave her two gems directly from my hand to hers, and sent her another eight through you. Should she not have lost [two of] yours, or three, or even all of them? But she was so scornful toward me that she lost those gems that I gave her directly from my hand to hers!’ That is what the Holy One blessed be He says to Jeremiah: “For My people have performed two evils” (Jeremiah 2:13). Was it two that they performed? Was that a reason to overlook twenty-two?<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Twenty-four sins are enumerated in Ezekiel 22, yet Jeremiah says that they were held accountable only for two (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>; Maharzu).</i> What is “for My people have performed two evils”? “I am [the Lord your God]” (Exodus 20:3) and “you shall not have [other gods before Me]” (Exodus 20:2). That is, “they have quickly deviated from the path that I commanded them” (Exodus 32:8). <br>“They crafted for themselves a molten [<i>masekha</i>] calf” (Exodus 32:8) – Rabbi Tanḥum ben Ḥanilai said: There were one hundred and twenty-five talents of gold in the calf, the numerical value of <i>masekha</i>, <i>mem</i> – forty, <i>samekh</i> – sixty, <i>kaf</i> – twenty, <i>heh</i> – five. Rabbi Levi says in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: One hundred and twenty talents, the numerical value of <i>masakh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mem</i> – forty, <i>samekh</i> – sixty, <i>kaf</i> – twenty = 120</i> as he removes the <i>heh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">He does not include the numerical value of the <i>heh</i> because it does not make a sound (<i>Etz Yosef</i>; see also Rabbi David Luria).</i> <br>Another matter: Rabbi Ami said: You have woven a bad weave for the generations.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In the midrash, the Hebrew phrase is followed here by its translation into Aramaic. The point is that the sin of the golden calf causes suffering throughout the generations, as the punishment for this sin is meted out gradually over time. </i> Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is an expression meaning noblemen [<i>sardeyotin</i>], <i>masekha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">They viewed the calf as a leader and guide, similar to a nobleman, more than as an actual god (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> The Holy One blessed be He said: That is how I will heal<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Heal is <i>masei </i>in Aramaic, which the midrash is reading into the word <i>masekha</i>.</i> them, as it is stated: “They crafted for themselves a molten calf” (Exodus 32:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">God says that He will allow them to atone for their sin by donating and fulfilling the rituals of the red heifer, just as they donated gold to the construction of the golden calf (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i>
<b>“The Lord said to Moses: I have seen this people and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people” (Exodus 32:9).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: I have seen this people, [and behold, it is a stiff-necked people]” (Exodus 32:9) – what is, “behold, it is a stiff-necked people”? Rabbi Yehuda ben Polvaya said in the name of Rabbi Meir: They were deserving of being beheaded. Rav Yakim said: There are three impudent ones. The most impudent among the beasts is the dog; among the birds, the rooster; and among the nations, Israel. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Redifa said in the name of Rabbi Ami: You think that this is derogatory, but it is only in their praise: Either Jewish or hanged.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">A Jew will not desert his faith even upon penalty of death. </i> Rabbi Avin said: Even today, outside of the Land of Israel, they call Israel the stiff-necked nation. <br>Rav Naḥman said: Know that they are difficult. When the Holy One blessed be He came to give them the Torah, what is written in their regard? “It was on the third day, when it was morning, [there was thunder and lightning and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of a horn exceedingly loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled]” (Exodus 19:16). The Holy One blessed be He said: I will show them all My miracles; if only it will be effective. <br>“Behold, it is a stiff-necked people. Now, let Me be and My wrath will be enflamed against them and I will destroy them” (Exodus 32:9–10) – was Moses restraining the Holy One blessed be He, that He says: “Let Me be”? Rather, to what is the matter comparable? It is to a king who became angry with his son. He took him in to a chamber and began preparing to strike him. The king was shouting from the chamber: ‘Let me be so I may strike him!’ The [son’s] tutor was standing outside. The tutor said: The king and his son are inside the chamber. Why is he saying: Let me be? It is because the king wishes that I will go and placate him regarding his son. That is why he is shouting: Let me be. So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Now let Me be.” Moses said: It is because the Holy One blessed be He wants me to placate Him regarding Israel; that is why He is saying: “Now, let Me be.” Immediately he began asking for mercy for them. That is, “Moses implored the Lord his God” (Exodus 32:11).

Chapter 43

<b> “Moses implored the Lord his God and he said: Lord, why is Your wrath enflamed against Your people that You took out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?” (Exodus 32:11).</b> <br>“Moses implored,” Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba began in this way: “He said He would destroy them, were it not for Moses, His chosen, who stood in the breach before Him” (Psalms 106:23). Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: The effective advocate is respectful in the trial. Moses was one of two advocates who stood to plead in favor of Israel, and who, as it were, were insolent vis-à-vis the Holy One blessed be He – Moses and Daniel. Moses, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “Were it not for Moses, His chosen…”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse continues, “who stood in the breach before Him,” implying that Moses stood in the way of God carrying out His will (Maharzu). </i> Daniel, from where is it derived? As it is stated: “I directed my attention [<i>vaetna et panai</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “I directed my face,” which connotes insolence, as opposed to directing one’s heart, which is more circumspect.</i> to the Lord God, to request…” (Daniel 9:3). These are the two men who were insolent vis-à-vis the attribute of justice, to ask for mercy upon Israel. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said two matters, one in the name of Rabbeinu,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “our rabbi,” this is a reference to Rabbi Berekhya’s mentor, Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon, who was a master in the realm of Aggada (see Maharzu). </i> and one in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman. Rabbeinu said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who was judging his son, and the prosecutor was standing and prosecuting. What did the son’s tutor do? When he saw that [the son] was being convicted, he shoved the prosecutor, took him outside, stood in his place, and pleaded in favor of the son. So too, when Israel crafted the calf, the accuser was standing and prosecuting inside and Moses was standing outside. What did Moses do? He stood and shoved the accuser, took him outside, and stood in his place, as it is stated: “Stood in the breach [<i>baperetz</i>] before Him,” he stood in the place of the one who breaches.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The accuser.</i> <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: “Stood in the breach before Him,” this is a very difficult matter. This is analogous to a king who became angry at his son, sat on the judicial platform, judged him, and convicted him. He took the quill to seal the sentence. What did his aide do? He snatched the quill from the king’s hand in order to suppress his fury. So too, when Israel performed that act,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the Golden Calf. </i> the Holy One blessed be He sat in judgment of them in order to convict them, as it is stated: “Let Me be, and I will destroy them” (Deuteronomy 9:14). He had not yet done so, but He came to seal the sentence, as it is stated: “One who sacrifices to gods, [other than to the Lord alone,] shall be destroyed” (Exodus 22:19). What did Moses do? He took the tablets from the hand of the Holy One blessed be He in order to suppress His fury. To what is the matter comparable? To a prince who sent to betroth a woman through an intermediary. She went and strayed with another man. The intermediary, who was guiltless, what did he do? He took the marriage contract that the prince had given him to betroth her and he ripped it. He said: ‘It is preferable that she be judged as a single woman and not as a married woman.’ So did Moses. When Israel performed that act, he took the tablets and broke them, saying that had they seen their punishment they would not have sinned.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Had they seen the fact that the prohibition of idolatry was written on the tablets, and had they known the severity of the punishment for this sin, they would not have sinned. </i> Moreover, Moses said: It is preferable that they be judged as unwitting sinners and not be intentional sinners. Why? It is because it was written in the tablets: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), and its punishment adjacent to it: “One who sacrifices to gods, [other than to the Lord alone,] shall be destroyed.” That is why he broke the tablets. <br>“He said He would destroy them” (Psalms 106:23); immediately, he began girding himself in prayer. That is, “Moses implored the Lord his God” (Exodus 32:11), that he stood before the Holy One blessed be He disrespectfully, to ask for Israel’s needs. That is, “Moses implored [<i>vayḥal</i>].”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded as though <i>vayḥal </i>was an expression of profaning [<i>ḥilul</i>], meaning that Moses acted in a brazen manner in his defense of Israel. </i>
Another matter, “Moses implored,” that is what is written: “The fury of a king is angels of death” (Proverbs 16:14). It is speaking of Moses. When Israel performed that act, the fury of the Holy One blessed be He intensified and He sent angels of destruction to destroy Israel. That is, “The fury of a king is angels of death.” “And a wise man will appease it” (Proverbs 16:14), this is Moses, who is called a wise man, as it is stated: “The wise goes up against the city of the mighty” (Proverbs 21:22), as he stood and spoke in favor of Israel, to reconcile them with their Father in Heaven. That is, “Moses implored.” <br>Another matter, “Moses implored,” that is what is written: “Cynical men will agitate a city” (Proverbs 29:8), this is Israel, who fanned the flames of fury in the world with the calf that they crafted, as Rabbi Asi said: There is no generation that does not take an ounce from the act of the calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In every generation there is some punishment due to the sin of the Golden Calf. </i> “And wise men will assuage wrath” (Proverbs 29:8), this is Moses, who suppressed the fury of the Holy One blessed be He with the favorable plea that he pleaded on behalf of Israel. That is, “Moses implored.”
Another matter, “Moses implored [<i>vayḥal</i>],” Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda says: Moses became ill [<i>ḥala</i>] when they performed that act. Rabbi Neḥemya says: What is “Moses implored”? It is that he gave God a gift of sorts.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Moses’ prayer was like a gift that he gave God in order to assuage His fury (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> This expression is nothing other than an expression that means gift, just as it says: “The daughter of Tyre will come seeking your favor [<i>yeḥalu</i>] with gifts…” (Psalms 45:13). Likewise, “Now, please implore [<i>ḥalu</i>] God…” (Malachi 1:9). The Rabbis say: What is “Moses implored”? He transformed the bitter into sweet, and <i>vayḥal</i> is an expression of sweetening [<i>ḥilui</i>]. How so? Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiya bar Ada of Yafo, in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: When Israel came to Mara, what is written there? “They came to Mara [and could not drink water from Mara, as it was bitter]” (Exodus 15:23). Moses began ruminating: This water, why was it created? What benefit does the world have from it? It is preferable that it would not have been created. The Holy One blessed be He knew what he was ruminating. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Do not say so. Is it not My handiwork? Is there any item in the world that was not created with a purpose? Rather, I will teach you what you should say. Say this: Transform the bitter into sweet.’ <br>From where is it derived that the Holy One blessed be He taught him to say this? See what is written: “He cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him [<i>vayorehu</i>] a tree” (Exodus 15:25). “He showed him [<i>vayarehu</i>]” is not written here, but rather, <i>vayorehu</i>; <i>vayorehu </i>is nothing other than an expression of instruction, as it is stated: “He instructed me [<i>vayoreni</i>] and said to me” (Proverbs 4:4), and it is written: “He gave him the ability to instruct [<i>ulhorot</i>]” (Exodus 35:34). The matter was a tradition known to Moses, but he had not employed it. Why did he ultimately employ it? When Israel came to the wilderness and God sought to annihilate them, Moses said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, do You seek to eliminate Israel and annihilate them from the world? Did You not say to me in Mara: Pray and say: Transform the bitter into sweet? Now, too, sweeten [<i>ḥali</i>] the bitterness of Israel and heal them.’ That is, “Moses implored [<i>vayḥal</i>].” Rabbi Avin said in the name of Rabbi Levi bar Perata: In the days of Moses, there was someone to sweeten our bitterness; that is, “Moses implored [<i>vayḥal</i>].” However, in the days of Daniel, there was no one to sweeten the bitterness, as it is stated: “We did not implore [<i>ḥilinu</i>] the Lord our God” (Daniel 9:13).
Another matter, “Moses implored [<i>vayḥal</i>],” what is this? Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo, in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: He dissolved the vow of his Maker. How so? When Israel crafted the calf, Moses rose to placate God, so He would pardon them. God said: ‘But I already took an oath: “One who sacrifices to gods shall be destroyed” (Exodus 22:19), and an oath that emerged from My mouth, I do not recant.’ Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, did You not give me [the laws of] nullification of vows, and You said: “If a man takes a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath to impose a prohibition upon himself, he shall not profane [<i>yaḥel</i>] his word”? (Numbers 30:3). He does not profane it, but a Sage may pardon [<i>moḥel</i>] his vow when he requests it. Any elder who issues rulings, who wants others to accept his ruling, must first fulfill it himself. You commanded me regarding the nullification of vows, it is only right that You nullify Your vow, as You commanded me to nullify for others.’ Immediately, he wrapped himself in his cloak and sat as an elder, and the Holy One blessed be He, may his name be blessed, was standing like one who requests nullification of his vow. <br>Likewise, it says: “I sat on the mountain” (Deuteronomy 9:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is usually translate “I remained [<i>va’eshev</i>] on the mountain” but a more literal translation is “I sat on the mountain.” </i> Is it possible that Moses was sitting, and God, may His name be blessed, was standing? Rabbi Derusai said: [God] crafted him a special chair like the chair of the scholars who enter before the sovereign; they appear to be standing but are actually sitting. Here too, it is sitting that appears like standing. That is, “I sat on the mountain.” <br>Another matter, “I sat on the mountain,” is there sitting above? You find that all of them are standing, as it is stated: “Seraphs standing above Him” (Isaiah 6:2); likewise, “when they stood their wings would slacken” (Ezekiel 1:24); and likewise, “I approached one of those standing” (Daniel 7:16). Likewise, even Moses would stand when he ascended on high, as it is stated: “I stood on the mountain” (Deuteronomy 10:10), and it is written: “I was standing between the Lord and you” (Deuteronomy 5:5). No one sits there other than the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “I saw the Lord sitting on His throne” (II Chronicles 18:18); yet he says: “I sat on the mountain”? What is this? Rav Huna bar Aḥa said: He sat to dissolve the vow of his Maker. What did he say to Him? A difficult matter. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The difficult matter he said to Him was: ‘Do You regret it?’<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If the individual who made a vow regrets it, the rabbi may nullify it. Although it is difficult to speak of God as experiencing regret, that is what Moses asked Him. </i> He said: ‘I regret the evil that I said I would perform against My people.’ At that moment, Moses said: ‘It is dissolved for You, it is dissolved for You. There is no vow here and there is no oath here.’ That is, “Moses implored [<i>vayḥal</i>]” – that he nullified the vow of his Maker, just as it says: “He shall not profane [<i>yaḥel</i>] his word’ (Numbers 30:3). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: That is why he is called man of God, to say that he dissolved a vow for God.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Just as a man can dissolve his wife’s vow, Moses dissolved God’s vow. </i> Likewise, “Moses implored [<i>vayḥal</i>].”
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The Holy One blessed be He gave Moses at Sinai an opening for a response [by saying]: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2). When Israel crafted the calf, Moses was placating God, but He did not listen to him. He said to him: ‘Is it possible that the attribute of justice will not be implemented against them for having violated the precept?’ Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, so you said at Sinai: “I am the Lord your God [<i>Elohekha</i>],”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The term is phrased differently in Hebrew when one is talking to an individual or to a group. This is the singular term. </i> <i>Eloheikhem<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">This is the term used when speaking to multiple people. </i> </i> was not stated. Did You not say it to me? Did You say it to them? Did I violate the precept?’<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Moses argued that the precept had been directed only to him on an individual basis and not to the entire nation, and therefore they could not be punished for violating the command. </i> That is, “Moses implored...” Rabbi Shemaya of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: That is why He wrote it again in the plural: “I am the Lord your God [<i>Eloheikhem</i>]” (Leviticus 19:2). Likewise, regarding all the mitzvot, He says: “I am the Lord your God [<i>Elokeikhem</i>], and He did not say again: “I am the Lord your God [<i>Elohekha</i>].”
Another matter, “Moses implored,” what is “Lord, why is Your wrath enflamed against Your people?” (Exodus 32:11). Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: To what is this matter comparable? To a king who had a member of his household whom he placed in charge of all that was his. That member of the household went and lent people by means of guarantors. He lent fifty gold pieces to this one, a hundred to that one, and two hundred to that one. The borrowers fled. Sometime later the king heard and he was unhappy. He said to him: ‘Did I put you in charge of what was mine in order to lose it?’ The member of the household said to him: ‘I lent, and it is my responsibility that they pay. I am restoring all of it to you. So and so is guarantor, and has one hundred gold pieces in his possession, and in the possession of so and so there are fifty.’ So too, Moses said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Why are You angry? Is it not because of Your Torah? It is my responsibility, I and my colleagues will fulfill it; Aaron and his sons will fulfill it, Joshua and Caleb will fulfill it, Yair and Makhir will fulfill it, the righteous will fulfill it, and I will fulfill it.’ That is, “why is Your wrath enflamed against your people?” <br>Rabbi Neḥemya said: When Israel performed that act, Moses rose to placate God. He said: ‘Master of the universe, they assisted You and You are angry at them? The calf that they crafted will assist You; you will cause the sun to shine, and it, the moon; You, the stars, it the constellations; You will cause the dew to fall, it will cause the wind to blow; You will cause the rain to fall, and it will cause plants to grow.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You, too, are mistaken like them; it lacks substance!’ He said to Him: ‘If so, why are you angry at Your children?’ That is, “why is Your wrath enflamed against your people?”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Why do You appear to be jealous due to an object that has no power? Alternatively, since they crafted it thinking it would be useful, they are not deserving of punishment. </i>
Another matter, “Lord, why is Your wrath enflamed against Your people?” Moses said: ‘Did You not say to me as follows: “Because your people has acted corruptly” (Exodus 32:7)? “Your people” has sinned, but not My people?<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">God, addressing Moses, stated that Moses’ people had sinned; He did not refer to them as His people. This is because it was the mixed multitude, whom Moses had allowed to join Israel, that had sinned. </i> If my people sinned, Your people have not sinned.’ That is, “why is Your wrath enflamed against Your people?”<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Moses argued that since it was only the mixed multitude who sinned, God should not be angry at Israel. </i> <br>Another matter, “Lord, why is Your wrath enflamed against Your people?” This is analogous to a king who entered his house and found his wife embracing a wooden figurine, and he became angry. His attendant said to him: ‘Were it capable of begetting children, it would be appropriate for you to be angry.’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">You should not be angry, as she was merely embracing a figurine, which is incapable of intimacy. </i> The king said to him: ‘This item has no capability in this matter; however, I seek to teach her not to act in this way.’ So too, God said: ‘I know that it lacks substance; however, let them not say that they may craft idols.’ [Moses] said to Him: ‘If it lacks substance, why are You angry at Your children?’ That is, “why is Your wrath enflamed against Your people?” <br>“That You took out of the land of Egypt” (Exodus 32:11). Why did he see fit to mention the exodus from Egypt here? Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, from where did You take them out? From Egypt, where they were all worshippers of lambs.’ Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is analogous to a wise man who opened for his son a perfume shop in a marketplace frequented by prostitutes. The alleyway had its effect, the craft had its effect, and the lad, as a young man, had his effect, and he went astray. His father came and caught him with the prostitutes. The father began to shout and say: ‘I will kill you!’ His friend was there and said to him: ‘You caused the lad to stray and you are screaming at him? You forsook all the crafts and taught him only perfumery. You forsook all the alleyways, and opened a shop for him only in the marketplace frequented by prostitutes.’ So too, Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, You forsook the entire world and You enslaved Your children only in Egypt, where they were worshippers of lambs. Your children learned from them and they, too, crafted a calf.’ That is why he said: “That You took out of the land of Egypt” – know from where You took them out.
Another matter, “that You took out of the land of Egypt,” why did he see fit to mention the exodus from Egypt here? Rabbi Yehuda bar Shalom said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon, in the name of Rabbi Levi ben Perata: To what is this matter comparable? To one who came to purchase a slave. He said to the master: ‘This slave that you are selling, is he base or noble?’ He said to him: ‘He is base; that is why I am selling him.’ He purchased him and took him to his home. One time, the slave acted corruptly and his master began striking him. He said to him: ‘I will kill you; what, is it a wicked slave that I seek?’ The slave began screaming: ‘You are subjecting me to injustice.’ His master said to him: ‘You acted corruptly; all this corruption, and you scream: You are subjecting me to injustice?’ The slave said: ‘Indeed. You are subjecting me to injustice.’ He said to him: ‘My master, how did you purchase me, as a good slave or as a wicked slave?’ He said to him: ‘As a wicked slave.’ He said to him: ‘You purchased me as a wicked slave and you expect me to be a good slave?’ So said Moses: ‘Master of the universe, did You not say to me: “Now, go and I will send you to Pharaoh” (Exodus 3:10), and I said to you: ‘On the basis of what merit will You redeem them? They are idolaters.’ You said to me: ‘Now you see them engaging in idol worship, but I see them departing from Egypt, and I will split the sea on their behalf, I will bring them to the wilderness, I will give them the Torah, I will show them My glory face to face, they will accept My kingdom, and they will deny Me after forty days and they will craft the calf. That is what it says: “I have seen [<i>rao ra’iti</i>] the affliction of [<i>oni</i>] My people (Exodus 3:7),” that is the sound of the calf, “the sound of distress [<i>anot</i>], I hear” (Exodus 32:18).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">When God said, in Egypt, “I have seen [<i>rao ra’iti</i>] the affliction of [<i>oni</i>] My people,” that statement alludes to the fact that God foresaw the sin of the Golden Calf. This is implied by the double term used for “seen” as well as the term <i>oni</i>, which has the same root as the term <i>anot</i> used in connection with the Golden Calf. </i> Before You redeemed them, You said to me that they would be crafting a calf, and now that they crafted it, You seek to kill them?’ That is why he mentioned the exodus from Egypt in his plea on their behalf. <br>Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen ben Ḥama said in the name of Rabbi Abahu, in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina: What is “I have seen [<i>rao ra’iti</i>]”?<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Why does the Hebrew verse employ a double term for seeing? </i> The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘You see them now, but I see them how they are looking at Me as I emerge in My chariot of glory in order to give them the Torah,’ as it is stated: “The chariots of God are myriad, thousands upon thousands of companies” (Psalms 68:18) ‘and they take one of My four animals,’ as it is written: “The face of an ox to the left of the four of them” (Ezekiel 1:10). That is why Moses said: ‘“Why is Your wrath enflamed?” You knew them, and now You are angry at them because they crafted the calf?’
Another matter, “that You took out of the land of Egypt,” (Exodus 32:11), why did he see fit to mention the exodus from Egypt here? Rabbi Avin said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: To what is this matter analogous? To a king who had a fallow field. He said to a sharecropper: ‘Go and tend to it and transform it into a vineyard.’ The sharecropper went, tended to that field, and planted a vineyard. The vineyard grew and produced wine, but it fermented. When the king saw that the wine fermented, he said to the sharecropper: ‘Go cut it down, is it a vineyard that produces vinegar that I seek?’ The sharecropper said to the king: ‘My lord king, how many expenditures did you expend on this vineyard before it stood, and now you seek to cut it down? If you say it is because its wine fermented, it is because it is young, that is why it fermented and it does not produce fine wine.’ So too, when Israel performed that act,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the Golden Calf. </i> the Holy One blessed be He sought to annihilate them. Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, did You not take them out of Egypt, from a place of idolaters? Now they are inexperienced,’ as it is stated: “For Israel was a lad and I loved him” (Hosea 11:1). ‘Wait a bit, go with them, and they will perform good deeds before You.’ That is, “that You took out of the land of Egypt.” <br>“Why shall the Egyptians speak, [saying: He took them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from upon the face of the earth? Relent from your enflamed wrath] and reconsider regarding the evil against Your people” (Exodus 32:12). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Abba said: Let reconsideration be common before You.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Moses prayed that even in the future, God should be willing to reconsider punishments that He would decide to impose upon Israel (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘What did you say, “reconsider regarding the evil against Your people”? As you live, so I will do,’ as it is stated: “The Lord reconsidered the evil” (Exodus 32:14).

Chapter 44

<b>“Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You took an oath by Yourself and spoke to them: I will multiply your descendants like the stars of the heavens, and this entire land that I said I will give to your descendants, they will inherit it forever” (Exodus 32:13).</b> <br>“Remember Abraham” – Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba began: “You transported a vine from Egypt” (Psalms 80:9). Why is Israel likened to a vine? Just as a vine, when its owners want it to improve, what do they do? They uproot it from its place and plant it elsewhere, and it improves. So too, when the Holy One blessed be He sought to make Israel known to the world, He uprooted them from Egypt and brought them to the wilderness, and they began thriving there. They began receiving the Torah and saying: “Everything that the Lord spoke we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). Their renown went forth in the world, as it is stated: “Your renown went forth among the nations for your beauty” (Ezekiel 16:14). <br>Another matter: “A vine from Egypt” – You provide support for all the opinions stated in its regard: “Behold, a vine was before me” (Genesis 40:9), “You transported a vine from Egypt”; ultimately You provide support.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God fulfills the various interpretations of these verses, which are understood as comparing Israel to a vine (see <i>Bereshit Rabba </i>88:5; <i>Vayikra Rabba</i> 36:2). </i> Just as this vine is alive and rests on dead branches,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">A grapevine is typically propped up or trellised across sticks or branches to allow it to flourish. </i> so too, Israel is alive and endures, and rests on the deceased; these are the patriarchs. Likewise, you find that Elijah recited many prayers on Mount Carmel so the fire would descend, just as it says, “Answer me, Lord, answer me” (I Kings 18:37); but he was not answered. However, once he mentioned the deceased and said: “Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel” (I Kings 18:36), he was immediately answered.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Although Elijah’s mention of the patriarchs appears in verse 36 and his general plea to “answer me Lord, answer me” appears in verse 37, the verses must be out of order, as it would not make sense to pray in the merit of the patriarchs and then, if that did not work, to pray in a general sense or to pray that he be answered in his own merit (<i>Yefe To’ar</i>). </i> What is written? “The fire of the Lord descended” (I Kings 18:38). Likewise, Moses: when Israel performed that act,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the golden calf. </i> Moses stood and pleaded in their favor for forty days and forty nights, but he was not answered. However, once he mentioned the deceased he was immediately answered, as it is stated: “Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel.” What is written? “The Lord reconsidered the evil” (Exodus 32:14). That is, just as this vine is alive and rests on dead branches, so too, Israel is alive and endures, and rests on the patriarchs, who are deceased. That is, “remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel.”
Another matter: “Remember Abraham” – that is what is written: “I praise the dead who have already died” (Ecclesiastes 4:2). Corresponding to whom did Solomon say this verse?<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Solomon is considered the author of Ecclesiastes. </i> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: He said it only corresponding to David, his father. How so? You find that when Solomon built the Temple, he prayed before God that the fire would descend, but he was not answered. However, once he mentioned the deceased, David his father, he was immediately answered, as it is stated: “Remember the kindness of David Your servant” (II Chronicles 6:42). Immediately, “When Solomon concluded praying” (II Chronicles 7:1) to the Lord, “the fire descended from the heavens” (II Chronicles 7:1). When Solomon saw that he mentioned those prayers and was not answered and once he mentioned David his father, it immediately descended, he began saying: “I praise the dead who are already dead, more than the living who are still alive” (Ecclesiastes 4:2). He said it in his own regard. <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He said it regarding Moses. How so? When he saw that Moses had stood in prayer for forty days and forty nights on behalf of Israel so that the Holy One blessed be He would pardon them for that act that they performed, and he had mentioned their merit but God would not be reconciled, yet once he mentioned the deceased he was immediately answered; what is written thereafter? “The Lord reconsidered” (Exodus 32:14). That is, “I praise the dead who have already died” – this is Moses.
Another matter: “Remember Abraham” – that is what is written: “From hand to hand, evil will not be absolved” (Proverbs 11:21). Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen ben Ḥama said: If you performed a mitzva, do not request to be given reward from one hand to another.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Do not demand immediate reward.</i> Why? Because you “will not be absolved,” as you will not be absolved from your iniquities,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If in this world you are rewarded for your good deeds and not punished for your transgressions, when you die you will have only transgressions on your record. </i> and you will be called wicked, as you did not seek to bequeath anything to your children. Had Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob asked to be given their reward for the mitzvot<i> </i>they performed, how would it have been that “the descendants of the righteous will escape” (Proverbs 11:21)? How could he have mentioned, “Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel”? Immediately, “The Lord reconsidered” (Exodus 32:14). That is, “From hand to hand, evil will not be absolved.”
Another matter: “Remember Abraham” – Rabbi Avin said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: This is analogous to a king whose friend deposited ten gems with him. His friend died and left one daughter. The king stood and took her as a wife, rendered her a noblewoman, gave her a necklace with ten gems, and placed it around her neck. Sometime later, she lost the necklace, and the king began seeking to expel her. He said: I will banish her from my house; I will expel her from being with me. Her attendant entered before the king and was placating him, but the king was not listening to him; rather, he was saying: I will banish her from being with me. He said to him: ‘Why, my lord the king?’ He said: ‘Because I gave her ten gems, and she lost them.’ He said: ‘As you live, my master the king, nevertheless, you must be placated and reconciled to her.’ The king would not listen to him. When the attendant saw what he sought to do to her, and that he was not being reconciled, but rather, he was vehemently saying ‘I will banish her,’ he said to him: ‘For ten gems that she lost, you seek to expel her? Do you not know that I know that her father deposited ten gems with you? Ten are exchanged for ten.’ So too, when Israel performed that act, God was angry at them. The Holy One blessed be He began saying: “Let Me be, and I will destroy them” (Deuteronomy 9:14). Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, why are You angry at Israel?’ He said: ‘Because they violated the Ten Commandments.’ He said to Him: ‘They have a way to repay the debt.’ He said to him: ‘From where?’ He said: ‘Remember that You tested Abraham with ten ordeals; let ten be exchanged for ten.’ That is, “remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel.”
Another matter: “Remember Abraham, [Isaac, and Israel]” – why does he mention three patriarchs here? The Rabbis say: Moses said: ‘If they are liable to be burned, remember Abraham, who gave his life in the fiery furnace to be burned for the sake of Your name. Let his burning be in exchange for the burning of his children. If they are liable to be beheaded, remember Isaac, their patriarch, who stretched his neck atop the altar to be slaughtered for the sake of Your name. Let his beheading be in exchange for the beheading of his children. If they are liable to be exiled, remember Jacob, their patriarch, who was exiled from his father’s house to Ḥaran; and let these be in exchange for those. That is, “remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel.”
Another matter: “Remember Abraham, [Isaac, and Israel]” – why did he mention three patriarchs? Rabbi Levi said: Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, will the dead live?’ He said to him: ‘Moses, have you become a heretic?’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Belief in the future resurrection of the dead is a cardinal tenet of the Jewish faith (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 90a). </i> Moses said to Him: ‘If the dead will not live in the future, it is appropriate that You do to them anything that you wish. However, if the dead will live, what will You say to the patriarchs in the future when they arise and ask You about the promise that You made to them? What will You be able to answer them? Did You not promise them that You would increase their children like the stars of the heavens, and now You seek to eliminate them?’ That is, “remember Abraham, [Isaac, and Israel].”
Another matter: “Remember Abraham, [Isaac, and Israel]” – why did Moses mention three patriarchs here? Rabbi Avin said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘I am asking from you just as I asked from Sodom, ten. Provide Me with ten righteous people from them, and I will not eliminate them.’ He said: ‘Master of the universe, I will provide for You; there are I, Aaron, Elazar, Itamar, Pinḥas, Joshua, and Caleb.’ God said to him: ‘These are seven, but where are the other three?’ He did not know what to do. Moses said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, will the dead live?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘If the dead will live, “remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,” that is ten.’ That is why he mentioned three patriarchs.
Another matter: “Remember Abraham” – what did he see that led him to mention three patriarchs? Rabbi Aloni ben Tabari said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: When they performed that act five angels of destruction, [namely] wrath, fury, anger, destruction, and annihilation, came to eliminate them, as it is written: “For I was in dread due to the wrath and the fury, [that the Lord was angry with you to destroy you]” (Deuteronomy 9:19). Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, You overcome one, and I one. You will overcome wrath, as it is stated: “Arise, Lord, in Your wrath” (Psalms 7:7). And I, fury, as it is stated: “To turn back His fury from annihilating” (Psalms 106:23).’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘If I overcome one and you [overcome] one, what will you do with the three?’ Moses said: ‘The three patriarchs will overcome those three.’ That is why he mentioned them.
Another matter: “Remember Abraham” – Rabbi Zevida said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, were the patriarchs of the world righteous or wicked? Distinguish between these and those; if they were wicked, it is appropriate that You are doing so to their children.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Treat them in accordance with the status of their ancestors. If their ancestors were wicked, it is appropriate for You to destroy them. </i> Why? Because their ancestors did not have worthy actions before You. But if they were righteous, give them the actions of their ancestors.’ That is, “remember Abraham.” <br>Rabbi Shmuel said: Moses said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, grant me permission to speak.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Say anything that you wish.’ He said: ‘They violated the beginning of the statement: “You shall not have [other gods before Me]” (Exodus 20:3); they transgressed it by crafting the calf. But You seek to violate its end, as it is stated: “Who performs kindness for thousands for those who love Me” (Exodus 20:6). And it is written: “The offspring of Abraham, who loves Me” (Isaiah 41:8). You said to Abraham: I will maintain kindness for your children up to two thousand generations, as it is stated: “Who performs kindness for thousands.” How many generations [have passed] from Abraham until now? Seven: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehat, Amram, Moses. If You do not perform kindness for seven, how will You perform kindness for two thousand?’ That is, they violated the beginning of the statement, but You seek to violate its end. <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Are you not a descendant of their children? I will kill these, and I will render you more numerous than they are, and My oath will be thereby fulfilled.’ Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, which document is better substantiated, one that is signed by three or one that is signed by one? You must say: One that is signed by three. Which ruling is better substantiated, one adjudicated by three or by one? You must say: The one that is adjudicated by three. Which testimony is more credible, the testimony of one or the testimony of three? You must say: The testimony of three.’ So too, Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, if You do not fulfill the matter regarding which You took an oath to three, but You seek to void it, how will you fulfill an oath to one? Just as You became angry at their children and You seek to kill them, so it will be with my children. Moreover, just as You took an oath to the patriarchs, and You established a covenant with them, as it is stated: “I will remember My covenant with Jacob, [and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham I will remember]” (Leviticus 26:42), so did You take an oath to the tribes, and You established a covenant with them.’ From where is it derived that the Holy One blessed be He took an oath to the tribes? As it is stated: “The oaths said to the tribes, Selah” (Habakkuk 3:9). From where is it derived that the Holy One blessed be He established a covenant with them? As it is stated: “I will remember for them the covenant with the ancients” (Leviticus 26:45) – this is the covenant of the tribes. ‘According to Your words, You will raise [a nation] only from the tribe of Levi, as I am from his tribe. What do You have to say to the tribe of Reuben and to the other tribes?’ Rabbi Yitzḥak said: At that moment, He was unable to respond to him. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You have spoken well.’ Immediately, “the Lord reconsidered [the evil that He had spoken of doing to His people]” (Exodus 32:14). God said to him: ‘I have reconsidered regarding My earlier pronouncements.’
What is, “to whom You took an oath by Yourself”? Ḥizkiya, Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi],<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Some maintain that the proper version of the text should read: Ḥizkiya ben Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. </i> and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Ḥizkiya said: Moses said: ‘Had You taken an oath to their ancestors by the heavens and by the earth, what you are doing to them would be appropriate, that You are eliminating their children. Why? Just as the heavens and the earth will cease to exist, so, Your oath to them will pass. Master of the universe, did You not take an oath to their ancestors by Yourself that You will not eliminate their children? Did You not say to Abraham: “I have taken an oath by Myself” (Genesis 22:16)?’ What is, “I have taken an oath by Myself”? The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: ‘Just as I live and endure forever and ever, so too, My oath endures forever and ever.’ That is, Moses spoke well, when he said: “To whom You took an oath by Yourself.” Act for the sanctity of Your name, so Your name will not be profaned. <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It was due to the merit of the patriarchs and the merit of the tribes that the Holy One blessed be He did so. From where do you know that Moses mentioned the tribes here? Isaiah came and articulated it, as it is stated: “Return for the sake of Your servants, the tribes of Your inheritance” (Isaiah 63:17). From here, that the tribes are called servants. Therefore, you expound, “remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel” – these are the patriarchs; “Your servants” – these are the tribes. He immediately reconciled with them, as it is stated: “The Lord reconsidered the evil” (Exodus 32:14). When the prophet saw this, he said: “But the Lord did not say that He would erase the name of Israel” (II Kings 14:27). <br>Rav Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan of Beit Guvrin: We find that the Lord said He would erase Israel in the [incident of the] calf and the spies, and he says: “But the Lord did not say that He would erase [the name of Israel]” (II Kings 14:27)? Rabbi Levi said: Since He said to Moses: “Let Me be” (Deuteronomy 9:14), He opened an opening for [Moses] so that he would ask for mercy on their behalf. That is, “but the Lord did not say that He would erase the name of Israel.” Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Since He said to him: “I will render you a great nation” (Exodus 32:10). That is, “but the Lord did not say that He would erase the name of Israel.” Why? Because Moses is from Israel.

Chapter 45

<b> “Moses said to the Lord: See, You say to me: Take this people up, but You have not informed me whom You will send with me. And You said: I know you by name and you have also found favor in My eyes” (Exodus 33:12).</b> <br>“Moses said to the Lord: See, You say to me,” that is what is written: “One moment I will speak of a nation and of a kingdom, [to uproot, to smash, and to eradicate, but if that nation repents of its evil, that which I spoke of,] I will reconsider the evil [that I thought to perform against it]” (Jeremiah 18:7–8). What is, “one moment I will speak”? In the blink of an eye I decree that a person shall die, and he repents and I am reconciled with him, as it is stated: “But if that nation repents of its evil.” Who are they? These are the people of Nineveh. What is written in their regard? “Rise, go to Nineveh, the great city” (Jonah 1:2). Why? “For their wickedness has ascended before Me” (Jonah 1:2). And it says: “Jonah had begun to enter the city, a journey of one day, [and he proclaimed and said: Forty more days and Nineveh will be overturned]” (Jonah 3:4). What is written there? “The people of Nineveh believed in God, and they proclaimed a fast and they donned sackcloth” (Jonah 3:5), “man and animal” (Jonah 3:8). They said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, the animal knows nothing, and you absolve it; we, too, consider us like an animal.’ As it is stated: “Man and animal, herd and flock, shall not taste anything” (Jonah 3:7). Immediately, “God reconsidered the evil that He had said to perform against them and did not perform it” (Jonah 3:10). <br>The Rabbis say: “One moment I will speak of a nation,” this is Israel, as it is stated: “Who is like Your people, like Israel, a unique nation on the earth” (II Samuel 7:23). “And of a kingdom,” this is Israel, who were called a kingdom, as it is stated: “You shall be for Me a kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6). “To uproot, to smash, and to eradicate” (Jeremiah 1:10; 18:7); because they performed that act<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The sin of the Golden Calf. </i> and He sought to destroy them, as it is stated: “Let Me be, and I will destroy them” (Deuteronomy 9:14). When Moses stood and asked for mercy for them, immediately, “The Lord reconsidered” (Exodus 32:14). [Moses] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, You became full of mercy for them; lead them Yourself to ascend to the land, and not by means of an emissary.’ That is what is written: “Moses said to the Lord: See, You say to me: Take this people up.”
What is written above? “The children of Israel were stripped of their ornament” (Exodus 33:6). Rabbi Ḥanin of Tzippori said: This is the crown that He placed on their heads, as it is stated: “And a crown of splendor upon your head” (Ezekiel 16:12). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: It is weapons with which He girded them. Rabbi Simi said: Royal purple garments, as it is stated: “[I clothed you in embroidery…] I decked you with ornaments” (Ezekiel 16:10–11). Likewise, it says: “You have exalted the Lord today…The Lord has exalted you [<i>he’emirkha</i>] today” (Deuteronomy 26:17–18).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>imra</i> in Aramaic refers to wool, and therefore this verse can be rendered “The Lord has clothed you today.” </i> <br>At that time, Moses became angry at them, took his tent, and left, as it is stated: “Moses would take the tent [and pitch it outside the camp]” (Exodus 33:7). Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said: See the honor that the Holy One blessed be He accorded to Moses; He forsook the upper worlds and came to Moses. The ministering angels would come to recite their hymn before Him, but He was with Moses. Likewise, the sun, the moon, and the stars came to prostrate themselves to Him and to receive permission to go out and illuminate the world, as were they not to receive permission and prostrate themselves, they would not go out, as it is stated: “The host of the heaven prostrate themselves to You” (Nehemiah 9:6). They asked the celestial creatures: ‘Where is the Throne of Glory?’ They said to them: ‘Go to Moses.’ From where is it derived that it is so? As it is stated: “It was, that anyone who sought the Lord [would go out to the Tent of Meeting]” (Exodus 33:7). “Who sought Moses” is not written here, but rather “who sought the Lord.” <br>What is written there? “The Lord would speak to Moses face to face” (Exodus 33:11). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Did I not stipulate with you that when you are angry, I will placate you,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A more literal translation of this phrase is: When your face is angry, My face will placate your face. </i> and when I am angry, you will placate Me? Relent and enter the camp,’ as it is stated: “The Lord would speak to Moses face to face.” <br>Another matter, “Moses said to the Lord: See, You say to me,” that is what is written: “I ponder the days of old, the years of long ago” (Psalms 77:6). The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, I am sitting and calculating after how many years You redeemed us from Egypt, and I then say after how many years You redeemed us from Babylonia, and I calculate and say: How many years have I experienced with Greece.’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The redemptions from Egypt and Babylonia came much more quickly than the redemption from Greece and the empires that followed, including Rome. This redemption has yet to occur. </i> That is why it says: “I ponder the days of old.” <br>“Then I said: This is my prayer [<i>ḥaloti hi</i>]” (Psalms 77:11). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: If these are illnesses [<i>ḥola’im</i>], they can be cured, but if they are not illnesses,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">But rather, it is due to a “change in the right of the Most High” (Psalms 77:11), meaning that God is not merely angry at Israel but has permanently rejected Israel, there is nothing I can do.</i> I do not know what to do. That is why it is stated: <i>Ḥaloti hi</i>. Rabbi Alexandri said: All these matters befell us because we did not implore before the Holy One blessed be He, and <i>ḥaloti </i> is nothing other than an expression of prayer, just as it says: “Now, please, implore [<i>ḥalu</i>] God and He will be gracious to us” (Malachi 1:9). “Has God forgotten to be gracious?” (Psalms 77:10). Have You forgotten that You said: “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious”? (Exodus 33:19). “Has He forsaken [<i>afes</i>] His kindness forever?” (Psalms 77:9). In the Greek language, <i>afes </i>is forsaken. That is why it is stated: “Has He forsaken [<i>afes</i>] His kindness forever?” <br>“Will the Lord abandon forever? Will He never again find favor?” (Psalms 77:8). Initially, when Moses would become angry at Israel, the Holy One blessed be He would placate him; when the Holy One blessed be He would become angry at Israel, Moses would placate Him, as it is stated: “The Lord would speak to Moses face to face.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Can two faces pour boiling water?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Boiling water would be tempered with cold water so that it could be drunk. If two people were each to add boiling water, the drink would be too hot. Similarly, God said to Moses, if you and I are both angry at Israel, that is a recipe for disaster. </i> Did I not say: When I will be angry, you placate Me, and when you will be angry, I will placate you?’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, was it not You who became angry at them first?’ He said to him: ‘Go and reconcile yourself with them, return to the camp.’ Rav Aḥa said: At that moment, Moses found the opportunity to speak before the Holy One blessed be He. He said to Him: ‘See, You are unable to remove Your love from them even for a moment,’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Even when You are angry at them, You are telling me to reconcile with them so that I can placate You. </i> as it is stated: “Moses said to the Lord: See, You say to me.”
You find: The Lord spoke with Moses, the Lord said to Moses, and likewise you find: Moses said to the Lord, Moses spoke to the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">These phrases are found in various verses in the Torah. </i> This is analogous to a cave that is located on the seashore. The sea rose and it filled. The sea did not recede from there, but from then on, the sea feeds the cave and the cave, the sea. So too, the Lord spoke to Moses, Moses said to the Lord.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, Moses was on such a high level that he not only received prophecies but also had an ongoing dialogue with God. </i> <br>What is written above? “Remove your ornaments” (Exodus 33:5). Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: These are the weapons that the Holy One blessed be He gave them with the ineffable name etched on them. “Moses would take the tent” (Exodus 33:7). When Moses saw the fine gift had been in their possession and that they lost it, he, too, became angry at them, as it is stated: “Moses would take the tent [and pitch it at a distance from the camp].” How far was he? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One <i>mil</i>; here it is stated: “At a distance [<i>harḥek</i>]” (Exodus 33:7), and it is stated there: “But there shall be a distance [<i>raḥok</i>] between you, two thousand cubits by measure” (Joshua 3:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mil</i> is two thousand cubits. </i> <br>Why was he angry at them? Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is what Moses expounded: One who is ostracized by the master, is ostracized for the disciple. Therefore, “Moses would take the tent.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: This is analogous to a king who had a legion and it rebelled against him. What did his general do? He took the royal ensign and fled. So too, Moses, when Israel performed that act, he took the tent and departed. That is why it is stated: “Moses would take the tent.”
<b>“It would be that when Moses would go out to the tent, each man would rise and each would stand at his tent's entrance; they would gaze after Moses, until he went into the tent” (Exodus 33:8).</b> <br>“It would be that when Moses would go out to the tent, all the people would rise.” They would stand on each side and show him honor, as it is stated: “Each would stand at his tent's entrance and they would gaze after Moses” (Exodus 33:8). What would they say? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Happy is the one who bore him with what she sees in him. <br><b>“It would be that when Moses would enter into the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and would stand at the entrance of the tent and He would speak with Moses” (Exodus 33:9). <br>“The entire people would see the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent and the entire people would rise and would prostrate themselves, each man at the entrance of his tent” (Exodus 33:10).</b> <br>“It would be that when Moses would enter into the tent.” When Israel would see the pillar of cloud they would know that the Divine Presence was revealed to Moses. “And the entire people would rise and would prostrate themselves, each man at the entrance of his tent.” The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Return to the camp.’ He said to Him: ‘I will not return.’ He said to him: ‘If you do not return, there is Joshua, know that he is in the tent.’ This is analogous to a noblewoman<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A wife of the king.</i> who became angry at the king’s daughter and she left the palace. There was an orphan girl who was raised with her in the king’s palace. He said to her:<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The king said to his wife. </i> ‘Return to your place.’ She did not want to do so. He said to her: ‘Know that that orphan girl is in the palace.’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">I will take her as my wife in your place.</i> So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Return to the camp; if not, Joshua is in the tent.’<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">I will appoint him leader in your place.</i> Who caused Moses to return to the camp? It was “his servant Joshua bin Nun” (Exodus 33:11). Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, it was for the sake of Your honor that I became angry at them. “See, You say to me,” see that You cannot forsake them. “But You have not informed me whom You will send with me.”’<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Moses was saying to God: If You are telling me to return, You must also return to the people. </i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I already said to you: “I will send an angel before you”’ (Exodus 33:2). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, are You handing me off to an angel? “If Your presence does not go, do not take us up from here”’ (Exodus 33:15).
<b>“He said: Show me, please, Your glory” (Exodus 33:18).</b> <br>“He said: Show me, please, Your glory.” Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba began: “As it is better that it be said to you: Come up here, than that you should be debased” (Proverbs 25:7). Hillel says: My debasing is my exalting, and my exalting is my debasing.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">When I debase myself I am exalted by others, and when I exalt myself I am debased by others (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> It is preferable for a person that they say to him: Ascend upward, and that they not say to him: Descend downward. David said: “Who sits exalted” (Psalms 113:5). When I exalt myself, they cause me to sit, debased. That is, “who sits exalted.”<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">The verse is understood to mean: He who is exalted is made to sit. </i> But when I debase myself, they exalt me, as it is stated: “Who is lowered to see” (Psalms 113:6). What caused me to see all the lands, as it is written: “David’s renown emerged in all the lands”? (I Chronicles 14:17). It is because I debased myself. <br>Another matter, “As it is better that it be said to you: Come up here,” this refers to Moses at the time when the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself to him at the bush, just as it says: “An angel of the Lord appeared…” (Exodus 3:2). Rabbi Yehuda bar Neḥemya said: Moses was a novice in prophecy. The Holy One blessed be He said: If I reveal Myself to him with a loud noise I will cause him to panic. If with a low voice, he will scorn the prophecy. What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He revealed Himself to him in his father’s voice. [Moses] said: ‘My father has come from Egypt!’ He said to him: ‘I am not your father, but rather, “the God of your father”’ (Exodus 3:6). “Moses concealed his face, [for he was afraid to look upon God]” (Exodus 3:6). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Moses did not act well in that he concealed his face. Had he not concealed his face, the Holy One blessed be He would have revealed to him what is above us, what is below us, and what is destined to be. Ultimately, he sought to see, as it is stated: “Show me, please, Your glory.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘When I sought you did not seek, now that you seek, I do not seek.’ <br>Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Nevertheless, He showed him three; in reward for three, he merited three. In reward for “[Moses] concealed” (Exodus 3:6) – “The Lord spoke to Moses [face to face]” (Exodus 33:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Citation based on <i>Matnot Kehuna</i>; see also <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 3:1. </i> In reward for “for he was afraid” (Exodus 3:6), – “they were afraid to approach him” (Exodus 34:30). In reward for “to look upon God,” (Exodus 3:6), – “he beholds [<i>yabit</i>] the image of God” (Numbers 12:8). <br>Rabbi Hoshaya Rabba said: Moses showed great deference in that he concealed his face, but Nadav and Avihu bared their heads and feasted their eyes on the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “Against the noblemen of the children of Israel He did not extend His hand [and they beheld God and ate and drank]” (Exodus 24:11). <br>Another matter, “he said: Show me, please, Your glory.” He sought to ascertain the granting of reward to the righteous and the tranquility of the wicked.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">He sought to comprehend the reward of the righteous in the World to Come and to understand why the wicked enjoy tranquility in this world. </i> From where is it derived that the granting of reward to the righteous is called glory? As it is stated: “The wise will inherit glory” (Proverbs 3:35). Likewise it says: “Glory before His elders” (Isaiah 24:23). From where is it derived that the tranquility of the wicked is called glory? As it is stated: “After glory You will take me” (Psalms 73:24).<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">After the wicked receive any reward they have earned in this world, they are taken to the next world for punishment.</i> What did the Holy One blessed be He answer him? “He said: You will not be able see My face [<i>panai</i>]” (Exodus 33:20). The expression <i>panai </i>stated here is nothing other than the tranquility of the wicked, as it is written: “He repays His enemies to their face [<i>el panav</i>] to eradicate them” (Deuteronomy 7:10).
<b>“The Lord said: Behold, there is a place with Me, and you shall stand on the rock” (Exodus 33:21).</b> <br>“The Lord said: Behold, there is a place with Me, and you shall stand on the rock.” Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: “Behold I am at this place” is not written here, but rather, “there is a place with Me.” My place is ancillary to Me and I am not ancillary to My place. <br><b>“I will remove My hand and you will see My back, but My face will not be seen” (Exodus 33:23).</b> <br>“I will remove My hand.” The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I will show you the reward of the righteous that I am destined to grant them at the end of days.’ Rabbi Asi said: The prophets saw the feast of the Garden of Eden, but they did not see the granting of reward, as it is stated: “No eye has seen it, God, other than You, who will do for one who awaits Him” (Isaiah 64:3). Likewise, David said: “How great is the goodness that You have stored for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20). <br><b>He said: I will pass all My goodness before you and I will call in the name of the Lord before you, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy” (Exodus 33:19).</b> <br>What is written above? “I will pass all My goodness before you” – the attribute of goodness and the attribute of punishment.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The verse could have stated simply “I will pass My goodness before you,” but instead states “I will pass all My goodness before you.” The word “all” alludes to the fact that even God’s punishments are good. </i> “I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.” At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He showed him all the storehouses of reward that are designated for the righteous. [Moses] said: ‘Who does this storehouse belong to?’ [God] said: ‘It belongs to those who perform mitzvot.’ ‘And who does this storehouse belong to?’ ‘It belongs to those who raise orphans.’ So it was for each and every storehouse. Then he saw a great storehouse.

Likewise, “I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy.”

Chapter 46

<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Carve for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you shattered” (Exodus 34:1).</b> <br>“The Lord said to Moses: Carve for yourself” – that is what is written: “He would tell you the secrets of wisdom” (Job 11:6). You find that when the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Go, descend, for your people have acted corruptly” (Exodus 32:7), he grasped the tablets and did not believe that Israel had sinned. He said: ‘If I do not see it, I do not believe it,’ as it is stated: “It was when Moses drew near to the camp [that he saw the calf and the dancing. Moses’ wrath was enflamed, and he cast the tablets from his hands, and he shattered them at the foot of the mountain]” (Exodus 32:19). He did not break them until he saw with his eyes. Woe to those people who testify about what they have not seen. Is it possible that Moses did not believe the Holy One blessed be He who said to him: “For your people have acted corruptly”? It is, rather, that Moses was informing Israel of proper conduct. Even if a person hears a matter from a trustworthy individual, it is prohibited to accept his testimony and to take action on the basis of his word if one does not see it. <br>Another matter: Because the writing flew off the tablets, he broke them, as it is stated: “I saw, and, behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 9:16). Moses saw that they sinned and he broke the tablets. This is analogous to a prince who took a wife, wrote a marriage contract, and placed it in the possession of a close friend. Sometime later, evil reports emerged about her. What did the close friend do? He tore up her marriage contract. He said: ‘It is preferable that she be judged as a single woman and not as a married woman.’ So Moses did; he said: ‘If I do not break the tablets, Israel will not survive, as it is stated: “One who sacrifices to gods shall be destroyed”’ (Exodus 22:19). What did he do? He broke them. He said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘They did not know what was written on them.’ <br>Another matter: “I saw, and behold, you had sinned against the Lord your God” – he saw that Israel would not survive, and he joined himself with them and broke the tablets. He said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘They sinned and I sinned, as I broke the tablets. If you pardon them, pardon me as well, as it is stated: “Now, if You will bear their sin” (Exodus 32:32) – pardon my sin as well. But if You do not pardon them, do not pardon me, but rather, “erase me please from Your book that You have written”’ (Exodus 32:32). Rabbi Aḥa said: He did not move from there until he cleared their sin, as it is stated: “Moses turned [<i>vayifen</i>] and descended” (Exodus 32:15) – [he descended] once he cleared [<i>pina</i>] their sin. <br>Moses said: Israel had someone to plead on their behalf; who will plead on my behalf? He began regretting the breaking of the tablets. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Do not regret the first tablets, as they were only the Ten Commandments alone. But on the second tablets that I am giving you there will be <i>halakhot</i>, midrash, and <i>aggadot</i>.’ That is what is written: “He would tell you the secrets of wisdom, as sagacity is two-sided” (Job 11:6). Moreover, you will receive the tidings that I pardoned you for your sin, as it is stated: “Know that God may overlook for you some of your iniquities” (Job 11:6).
Another matter: “Carve for yourself” – that is what is written: “To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose.… a time to be born and a time to die” (Ecclesiastes 3:1–2). From here, our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: When a woman sits on the birthing stool, she has a ninety-nine percent [chance] of death, and one [percent chance] of life,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The point is that it is a time of great danger. </i> as it is stated: “A time to be born,” which is “a time to die.” And all of them<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">All of the following verses should be understood in a similar manner. </i> until you reach: “A time to cast stones” (Ecclesiastes 3:5) – “sacred stones are spilled” (Lamentations 4:1). “And a time to gather stones” (Ecclesiastes 3:5) – “the Lord is the builder of Jerusalem” (Psalms 147:2), “the precious stones of the crown exalted over His land” (Zechariah 9:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, “a time to cast stones” alludes to the destruction of Jerusalem, and “a time to gather stones” alludes to its ultimate rebuilding. </i> <br>Another matter: “A time to cast stones” (Ecclesiastes 3:5) – “the wrath of Moses was enflamed, and he cast [the tablets] from his hands” (Exodus 32:19). “And a time to gather stones” – “carve [<i>pesol</i>] for yourself” – the carving debris [<i>pesolet</i>] is for you; from there Moses became wealthy. The Holy One blessed be He said: By right Moses should receive that debris. Why? Israel, which was not engaged in mitzvot, I gave them all the goodness of the land of Egypt, as it is stated: “The Lord granted the people favor [in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they lent to them; and they despoiled Egypt]” (Exodus 12:36), and they became wealthy; shall Moses, who was engaged with Joseph’s bones, remain poor?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Moses took Joseph’s bones from Egypt (see Exodus 13:19) and therefore did not have time to borrow valuables from the Egyptians. </i> I will give him the debris so he will become wealthy.
This is one of three things that Moses did based on his own reasoning, and his reasoning accorded with the reasoning of the Holy One blessed be He. He separated from his wife; Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: He expounded and said: If regarding Mount Sinai, whose sanctity was temporary, it is stated: “Do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15), I, who, each and every moment He speaks with me, is it not right that I should be separated from my wife? Rabbi Akiva says: It was stated to him from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Mouth to mouth I speak with him” (Numbers 12:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">When Miriam and Aaron disparaged Moses for having separated from his wife, God responded by saying “Mouth to mouth I speak with him.” Rabbi Akiva interprets this to mean that God told them that He had commanded Moses to separate from his wife. </i> Rabbi Yehuda said: It was stated to him from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Do not approach a woman”; Moses was included among them and all were prohibited. When [God] said: “Return you to your tents” (Deuteronomy 5:27), He permitted them. Moses said to Him: ‘Am I included among them?’ He said to him: No, “you stay here with Me” (Deuteronomy 5:28). <br>Additionally, [Moses] expounded and said: If at Mount Sinai, which was temporary, He would not have spoken to me until He called to me,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Only after God called to Moses and told him to ascend the mountain was God ready to speak with him. Had Moses ascended before being called, God would not have spoken to him. </i> as it is stated: “The Lord called to him from the mountain, saying” (Exodus 19:3), at the Tent of Meeting<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The sanctity there was permanent.</i> all the more so. The Holy One blessed be He knew, and He called to him, as it is stated: “He called to Moses…[from the Tent of Meeting]” (Leviticus 1:1). <br>Additionally, [Moses] expounded and said: If regarding the paschal offering, which is an offering of lesser sanctity, it is stated: “No stranger shall partake of it” (Exodus 12:43), the tablets that are the handiwork of God, shall idolaters have use of them? That is why he broke them. See the praiseworthiness of Moses. Aaron and the seventy elders were seizing Moses’ hands, but they were unable to overcome him. Not only those, but the will of the Holy One blessed be He, too, was that he not break them, as it is stated: “All the signs and the wonders” (Deuteronomy 34:11).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Moses’ breaking of the tablets was a “wonder” in that he overpowered the elders in order to break the tablets and that he did so without God’s prior approval. Alternatively, God was actually opposed to the breaking of the tablets; He wanted Moses to withhold them from the Israelites but not to break them (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Let there be peace for that hand, as it is stated: “And with all the mighty hand” (Deuteronomy 34:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is to the hand with which he broke the tablets. Thus, God’s blessing of Moses’ hand expressed His approval of Moses’ act after the fact (Rashash). </i>
Another matter: “Carve for yourself” – that is what is written: “But now, Lord, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are our Potter” (Isaiah 64:7). The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Now I am your Father? When you saw yourselves in distress, you called me: Our Father.’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">You relate to me as your Father only when you need me. </i> They said to Him: ‘Yes, as it is stated: “On the day of my distress I sought the Lord”’ (Psalms 77:3). This is analogous to the son of a prominent doctor who encountered a lowly individual and began asking after his welfare. He said to him: ‘My lord, my master, my father.’ His father heard and became angry at him. He said: ‘Let him not appear in my presence, since he called that lowly individual: My father.’ Sometime later, the son fell ill. He said: ‘Please call my father so he will see me.’ They came and told his father. He was immediately overwhelmed with compassion for [his son] and came to him. [The son] said to him: ‘I implore you, my father, look at me.’ He said to him: ‘Now I am your father? Yesterday, you were calling the lowly individual: My father. Now that you are in distress you call me: My father?’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Now you call me: My Father? Yesterday, you were engaged in idol worship and calling it: My father, as it is stated: “They say to wood: You are my father…but in the time of their misfortune they say: [Arise, and save us]”’ (Jeremiah 2:27). That is why it is stated: “But now, Lord, You are our Father.” <br>Another matter: “But now, Lord, You are our Father…” (Isaiah 64:7) – that is what is written: “A son will honor his father” (Malachi 1:6) – this is Esau, who honored his father greatly, as he would go out to the fields, hunt game, bring it [home], cook it, and go and feed his father each day. “And a servant his master” (Malachi 1:6) – this is Nevuzaradan, who was called a servant, as it is stated: “Nevuzaradan, captain of the guards, servant of the king of Babylon, came” (II Kings 25:8), as when he came to Jerusalem, he brought with him a likeness of Nebuchadnezzar and would stand before it in awe and reverence like a servant. But you did not honor Me like a father, and you did not fear Me like a master. That is, “if I am a father, where is My honor? If I am a master, where is My fear” (Malachi 1:6)? Rather, when you see yourselves in distress, you call Me your Father. That is why it is stated: “But now, Lord, You are our Father.” <br>What is, “we are the clay and You are our Potter” (Isaiah 64:7)? Israel said: ‘Master of the universe, You had it written for us: “Behold, like clay in the hand of the potter, so you are in My hand, house of Israel” (Jeremiah 18:6). Therefore, even though we sin and commit provocations before You, do not depart from us. Why? Because “we are the clay and You are our Potter.”’ Come and see this potter, if he crafts a barrel and leaves a pebble in it, when it emerges from the kiln, it leaks from the place of the pebble and loses all the liquid that is placed in it. Who caused the barrel to leak what was inside it? The potter who left the pebble in it. So too, Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, You created in us an evil inclination from our youth, as it is stated: “As the inclination of man's heart is evil from his youth” (Genesis 8:21). It causes us to sin before You, but You do not remove this instigator from us. Please remove it from us so we will perform Your will.’ He said to them: ‘That is what I will do in the future,’ as it is stated: “On that day, the utterance of the Lord, I will gather the lame, assemble the outcasts and those whom I harmed [<i>vaasher hare’oti</i>]” (Micah 4:6). What is <i>asher hare’oti</i>? This is the evil inclination [<i>yetzer hara</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the phrase <i>asher hare’oti</i> is understood to mean, “the evil I have caused,” or, “those I have caused to be evil” via the evil inclination. </i> as it is stated: “As the inclination of man's heart is evil from his youth.” <br>Another matter: “But now, Lord, You are our Father” (Isaiah 64:7) – that is what is written: “Lord, they sought You in distress” (Isaiah 26:16); when they encounter distress they seek You, as it is stated: “Lord, they sought You in distress.” This is analogous to a prominent official who had children; they adhered to wicked people and strayed to the evil path. He stripped them and cast them out. When they saw themselves in distress, they asked prominent people to ask for mercy on their behalf. Their father said to [the messengers]: ‘What are you requesting?’ They said to him: ‘That you reconcile with your children.’ He said: ‘They are not my children; I do not acknowledge them. Their mother committed adultery and bore them.’ They said to him: ‘You cannot renounce them. Why? Because everyone knows that they are your children, because they resemble you.’ <br>So too, the prominent official is the Holy One blessed be He. His children are Israel, as it is stated: “You are children to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1). They mingled with idolaters and strayed to the evil path, as it is stated: “They mingled with the nations and learned their practices” (Psalms 106:35). What did He do to them? He stripped them and cast them away, as it is stated: “They will strip you of your garments” (Ezekiel 23:26), and it is written: “Send them from My presence and let them depart” (Jeremiah 15:1). <br>When they found themselves in distress they began asking the prophets to ask for mercy on their behalf from the Holy One blessed be He. They began asking for mercy for them, as it is stated: “Have pity upon Your people” (Joel 2:17). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘On behalf of whom are you asking?’ They said: ‘On behalf of Your children.’ He said to them: ‘They are not My children. If they perform My will they are My children, and if not, they are not My children,’ as it is stated: “Their mother has committed licentiousness, she who conceived them has shamed herself” (Hosea 2:7). Why? “For she said: I will follow my paramours” (Hosea 2:7) – these are idols. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He said: “Now, I will expose her repulsiveness in the eyes of her paramours” (Hosea 2:12) – these are idols, whom she calls: “Providers of my bread and my water” (Hosea 2:7). But [the idol] has eyes but does not see, ears, but does not hear, and cannot feed itself; how will it feed others? The Holy One blessed be He stripped her, as it is stated: “Lest I strip her bare” (Hosea 2:5). <br>The prophets said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You say that they are not Your children, but they are recognizable by their faces, as it is stated: “All who see them will recognize them, for they are the seed the Lord has blessed” (Isaiah 61:9). Just as it is the way of a father to have mercy on his children even though they have sinned, so too, You must have mercy upon them.’ That is, “but now, Lord, You are our Father” (Isaiah 64:7). <br>Likewise you find that when they crafted the calf, the Holy One blessed be He became angry at them. Moses came to placate Him, and He called them: Not My people, as it is stated: “Because your people has acted corruptly” (Exodus 32:7). The Holy One blessed be He stripped them, as it is stated: “The children of Israel were stripped of their ornament from Mount Ḥorev” (Exodus 33:6). Moses said: ‘They are Your people and You cannot renounce them,’ as it is stated: “Why, Lord, is Your wrath enflamed against Your people?” (Exodus 32:11). ‘Reconcile with them because they are Your children.’ Immediately He reconciled with them, as it is stated: “The Lord reconsidered” (Exodus 32:14). He showed Moses that He reconciled with them, as He restored the commandments to them, as it is stated: “Carve for yourself.”
Another matter: “But now, Lord, You are our Father” (Isaiah 64:7) – the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘What did you see that led you to seek Me now? Above it is written: “There is no one calling Your name, rousing himself to hold on to You, because You concealed Your face from us and melted us because of our iniquities” (Isaiah 64:6). Now that you see yourselves in distress, you come to Me and say: “You are our Father”? Even though everything is My handiwork, I wish to show Myself as Father and Maker only to one who performs My will,’ as it is stated: “Everyone who is called by My name, whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him and I have made him” (Isaiah 43:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This verse indicates that God views Himself as Maker only of those who are “called by My name,” meaning that they are fulfill God’s commands and His will. </i> <br>Another matter: “But now, Lord, You are our Father” (Isaiah 64:7) – the Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Have you forsaken your patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Me you call Father?’ They said to Him: ‘It is You that we acknowledge as a father.’ This is analogous to an orphan girl who was being raised by a guardian who was a good, trustworthy person. He raised her and protected her properly, and sought to marry her off. The scribe entered to write the marriage contract. He said to her: ‘What is your name?’ She said: ‘So-and-so.’ He said to her: ‘And what is your father’s name?’ She was silent. Her guardian said to her: ‘Why are you being silent?’ She said to him: ‘It is because I do not know any father other than you, for it is the one who raises who is called father and not the one who begets.’ So too, the orphans are Israel, as it is stated: “We have become orphans, without a father” (Lamentations 5:3). Their good and trustworthy guardian is the Holy One blessed be He. Israel began calling Him: Our Father, as it is stated: “But now, Lord, You are our Father.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Have you forsaken your patriarchs and Me you call: Our Father,’ as it is stated: “Look to Abraham your father” (Isaiah 51:2). They said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, the one who raises is the father, not the one who begets, as it is stated: “For You are our Father; for Abraham does not know us”’ (Isaiah 63:16). <br>

Chapter 47

<b>“The Lord said to Moses: Write for yourself these matters, as according to these matters I established a covenant with you and with Israel” (Exodus 34:27).</b> <br> “Write for yourself these matters,” that is what is written: “I write for him the many teachings of My Torah, but they are regarded as foreign” (Hosea 8:12). When the Holy One blessed be He revealed Himself at Sinai to give the Torah to Israel, He said it to Moses in order: Bible, Mishna, Talmud, and <i>aggada</i>, as it is stated: “The Lord spoke all these matters” (Exodus 20:1); even what a student asks his teacher, the Holy One blessed be He said to him at that time. After [Moses] learned it from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He, He said to him: ‘Teach it to Israel.’ He said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, I will write it for them.’ He said to him: ‘I do not wish to give it to them in writing, because it is revealed before Me that idolaters are destined to rule over them, and take it from them, and they will be despised among the idolaters.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The idolators will force the Jews to translate the Written Torah for them. Later, they will claim that they are the true Israelites, as they also have the Torah (<i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>; see <i>Pesikta Rabbati</i> 5:1). </i> Rather, I will give them the Bible in writing, and I will give them the Mishna, Talmud, and <i>agadda</i> orally, so if the idolaters come to them and subjugate them, they will be distinct from them.’ He said to the prophet: If I write for them the many teachings of My Torah, they will be regarded as foreign.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Hosea is understood to mean: If I write down the entire Torah, Israel will be regarded as foreigners. </i> What will I do for them? I will give them the Bible in writing, and the Mishna, Talmud, and <i>agadda </i>orally [<i>al peh</i>]. “Write,” this is the Bible; “as according to [<i>al pi</i>] these matters” (Exodus 34:27), these are the Mishna and the Talmud, which distinguish Israel from the idolaters.
Another matter, “write for yourself,” the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘I wrote the first tablets, as it is written: “Written with the finger of God” (Deuteronomy 9:10). But the second [tablets], you write and hopefully I will give a hand.’<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">God would assist Moses in inscribing the tablets. </i> This is analogous to a king who married a woman and wrote her a marriage document of his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">On his paper in his handwriting.</i> Sometime later she sinned and he expelled her from his house. Her attendant came and reconciled her with the king. The king said to the attendant: ‘I have reconciled with her. Prepare a marriage document for her and hopefully I will give a hand.’ That is what is written: “I will inscribe on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets” (Deuteronomy 10:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In this verse, God tells Moses that after Moses carves the tablets, God will inscribe them with the words that were on the first tablets. </i>
Another matter, “write for yourself,” on the basis of your merit I am giving them the Torah. Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta said: That it what Moses said to Israel: “He inscribed on the tablets, like the first inscription…and the Lord gave them to me” (Deuteronomy 10:4). He gave them to me, and I conducted myself generously with you and gave it to you. That is why it is stated: “Write for yourself” – it was on the basis of your merit. “As according to these matters [<i>hadevarim</i>],” everywhere that<i> davar, devarim</i>, <i>hadevarim</i> is written, they are curses and rebukes.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The first tablets were given with the assumption that the Israelites would be free of the evil inclination, and therefore there was no need to warn them that they would be cursed if they would transgress. The second tablets, given after the sin of the Golden Calf, were given along with warnings and curses that would be imposed if the Israelites would transgress (Rabbi David Luria). </i> <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Write for yourself these matters, as according to [<i>al pi</i>] these matters” – the written Torah and the Oral Torah – “I established a covenant with you.” If you exchange it and you render what is oral written and what is written oral, you will not receive reward. Why? Because that is the way I gave it, as a written Torah and an oral Torah. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shimon says: “Write for yourself…as according to…” the written Torah and the oral Torah, “I established a covenant with you,” so that you read them so,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">That you study the Written Torah in writing and the Oral Torah orally. </i> but if you exchange them, know that you are voiding the covenant. That is why it is stated: “Write for yourself these matters.” Likewise, Moses says to Israel: “Only beware, and protect yourself greatly, lest you forget the matters [that your eyes saw]” (Deuteronomy 4:9). What are “the matters”? These are the matters that you see, as they are in writing. “Lest they move from your heart” (Deuteronomy 4:9), these are the matters that I gave you orally. That is why it is stated: “Write for yourself these matters, as according to these matters,” as, were it not for the Torah that you received, I would not have distinguished you and I would not have looked upon you more than other nations. That is why “I established a covenant with you and with Israel.” <br>Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘In the past, you were called like the rest of the nations, like: “Savta, Rama, and Savtekha” (I Chronicles 1:9).<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">These nations were named after their forebears, and so too the name Israel signified only that they were descendants of Israel (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> But when you received My Torah, I established a covenant with you and elevated you. Not only Israel, but you, too, their king, I elevated you in the world only due to the merit of the Torah.’ How did the Holy One blessed be He elevate him? Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak: All the honor that Moses experienced in this world was only the profits, but the principal endures for him for the World to Come.
Another matter, “As according to [<i>al pi</i>] these matters,” that you must toil in them with your mouth [<i>befikha</i>]. Likewise it says: “In your mouth and in your heart to perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:14). What is “I established a covenant with you and with Israel”? Had you not accepted My Torah, I would have restored the world to emptiness and disorder, as it is stated: “If not for My covenant day and night, [I would not have set the statutes of heaven and earth]” (Jeremiah 33:25). Why? Because it was with the Torah that I created heaven and earth, as it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom” (Proverbs 3:19), “with His knowledge the depths were breached” (Proverbs 3:20). If you void the covenant, you cause Me to restore the upper and lower worlds to emptiness and disorder. Therefore, “as according to these matters.”
<b>“He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water. He wrote upon the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten precepts” (Exodus 34:28).</b> <br>“He was there with the Lord.” Is it possible for a person to be forty days without food and without drink? Rabbi Tanḥuma says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Avin in the name of Rabbi Meir: The proverb says: You went to the city, follow its conventions. Above, where there is no eating and drinking, Moses ascended and was like them. Below, where there is eating and drinking, the ministering angels descended and ate and drank, as it is stated: “He stood over them beneath the tree and they ate” (Genesis 18:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham served his three guests food thinking they were men, but in fact they were angels. Nonetheless, they ate the food. </i> Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They appeared as though they were eating, and each morsel disappeared. <br>Another matter, “he was there with the Lord,” there was an incident involving Rabbi Yoḥanan who was ascending from Tiberias to Tzippori. His student, Rabbi Ḥiya, was with him. Rabbi Yoḥanan saw a vineyard. He said to Rabbi Ḥiya: ‘Do you not see that vineyard that was mine and I sold it for such and such a sum?’ At that moment Rabbi Ḥiya bar Abba wept and said to him: ‘Did you not leave anything for your old age?’ He said to him: ‘Is it insignificant in your eyes that I sold an item that was created in six days and I acquired an item that was given in forty days? The world and all that it holds was created in six days, but the Torah was given in forty days.’ <br> “He did not eat bread,” but he partook of the bread of Torah. “He did not drink water,” but he drank the water of Torah. He would study Torah by day and would interpret it himself at night. Why did he do so? It was to teach Israel that they should toil in Torah by day and by night. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish would say to his students: ‘Come and study Torah in the daytime and it will become clear at night.’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Reish Lakish holds that the ideal time for intensive study is at night. Therefore he urged his students to memorize the material by day, and then to analyze it at night, when they would achieve full clarity in understanding it (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). However, see Maharzu and Rabbi David Luria, who offer other interpretations of this statement. </i> Rabbi Yoḥanan would say to his students: Come and study Torah for it is daytime. Nevertheless, Rabbi Yoḥanan would concede that the song of Torah is only at night, as it is stated: “Arise, sing at night” (Lamentations 2:19), and likewise it says: “She arises while it is still night” (Proverbs 31:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This passage in Proverbs is interpreted as referring to one who seeks Torah. </i> The Rabbis say: During the day and at night, as it is stated: “He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights.” That is why the Sages instituted that the teachers of Mishna would have sessions in the morning and in the evening, to realize what is stated: “This book of the Torah shall not depart [from your mouth, and you shall ponder it day and night]” (Joshua 1:8). <br>Another matter, “he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread, and he did not drink water” in this world, but in the world to come he will partake of the bread of Torah and drink its water. That is why “He did not eat bread.” What, then, did he eat? He was sustained by the aura of the Divine Presence. Do not wonder, as the heavenly beasts that bear the Throne are sustained by the aura of the Divine Presence.
<b>“It was, upon Moses’ descent from Mount Sinai, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in the hand of Moses upon his descent from the mountain and Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant upon His speaking with him” (Exodus 34:29).</b> <br> “He wrote upon the tablets” – it teaches that the first and the second were identical, Ten Commandments. How were they configured? There were five on this tablet and five on that tablet, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Ten on this tablet and ten on that tablet, as it is stated: “It was, upon Moses’s descent from Mount Sinai, [and the two tablets of the Testimony].”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is expounded to mean that on each of the two tablets, the entire Testimony consisting of the Ten Commandments was inscribed.</i> The writing was bearing them,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The engraved letters miraculously held up the stone tablets. </i> but they appeared as though they were in Moses’s hand, as it is stated: “And the two tablets of the Testimony were in the hand of Moses.” <br> “Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant.” From where did Moses receive the rays of splendor? The Rabbis say: From the cave, as it is stated: “It will be with the passage of My glory” (Exodus 33:22). Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: The length of the tablets was six handbreadths and their width six handbreadths. Moses was grasping two handbreadths, the Divine Presence two handbreadths, and there were two handbreadths in the middle. It was from there that Moses received the rays of splendor.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">From his closeness to God at that time. </i> Rabbi Yehuda bar Naḥman says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: While he was writing with a quill, a bit [of ink] remained. He passed [the quill] over his head and from it the rays of splendor were formed for him, as it is stated: “Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant [upon His speaking with him].”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">As God spoke to Moses and Moses wrote what God said, the rays of splendor were formed. </i>
Another matter, “the Lord said to Moses: Write for yourself these matters” (Exodus 34:27) – that is what is written: “It is good for me that I was afflicted, so I might learn Your statutes” (Psalms 119:71). It was for Moses’s benefit that he fasted the one hundred and twenty days that he received the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This includes the forty days Moses spent on Mount Sinai before he descended with the first tablets; the forty days he spent on Mount Sinai pleading for forgiveness for Israel after the sin of the Golden Calf; and the forty days he spent there before descending with the second tablets. He studied Torah on all those days (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> From what would Moses eat? It was from the aura of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And You sustain them all” (Nehemiah 9:6). <br>Another matter, from what did he eat? It was from the Torah, as it is stated: “Son of man, eat what you find, [eat this scroll]…I ate it” (Ezekiel 3:1, 3). Why? It is because the Torah is sweet, as it is stated: “And sweeter than honey and the nectar of ripe fruit” (Psalms 19:11). <br>Another matter, it was from the bread of Torah, as it is written: “Come, partake of my bread” (Proverbs 9:5). From where is it derived that he did not sleep and did not doze? This is analogous to a king who was fond of his treasurer. He said to him: ‘Weigh gold dinars for yourself.’<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">He gave him a certain time in which he could collect gold dinars for himself from the royal treasury. </i> In his joy, he sought neither to eat nor to drink. He sought to sleep.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In his eagerness to collect treasure, he did not eat or drink but just collected gold dinars. Eventually, though, he became tired. </i> He said: ‘If I sleep, I will lose these.’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Even when he was tired he did not sleep so that he would not lose out on the unique opportunity to collect golden dinars. </i> So too, Moses was assessing the Torah, and he forgot and neither ate nor drank. He sought to sleep. He said: ‘If I sleep, I will lose, as He told me only forty days.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You afflicted yourself; by your life, you will not lose. On the first tablets there were only the Ten Commandments. Now that you afflicted yourself, I will give you <i>halakhot</i>, <i>midrashim</i>, and <i>aggadot</i>,’ as it is stated: “Write for yourself these matters” (Exodus 34:27). <br>Why did the Holy One blessed be He say: “Write for yourself”? Is it not written: “The script was the script of God” (Exodus 32:16) and it is written: “He inscribed on the tablets, like the first inscription” (Deuteronomy 10:4)? Rather, this is what the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Write the Torah, Prophets, and Writings, as they shall be in writing, but the <i>halakhot</i>, <i>midrashim</i>, <i>aggadot</i>, and Talmud, will be oral.’ When Moses knew this, he began saying: “It is good for me that I was afflicted” (Psalms 119:71); “The Torah of Your mouth is better for me [than thousands of gold and silver pieces]” (Psalms 119:72).
Another matter, how did Moses know how many days he had spent? It is written: “He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights.” From where is it derived that there is no night On High? As it is stated: “Even darkness does not darken for You. The night, as day, illuminates. Darkness and light are the same” (Psalms 139:12). How did he know? As it is stated: “I stood on the mountain like the first days” (Deuteronomy 10:10), and it is written: “I sat on the mountain” (Deuteronomy 9:9). Say, now, when He was speaking with him he was standing, and when He would depart from him, he would sit and review what he had learned. You thus uphold [both verses:] “I stood on the mountain” and “I sat on the mountain.” When He spoke with him, he would know it was day, and when He said to him: ‘Study your Torah,’ he would know it was night. Likewise, David said: “Day to day gives utterance; night to night renders understanding” (Psalms 19:3).
Another matter, “write for yourself” – all the righteous came to the Holy One blessed be He with craftiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">They began with a minor request and gradually moved to a major request.</i> Regarding Abraham, it is written: “How fair are your steps in sandals…the handiwork of a craftsman” (Song of Songs 7:2). He came with craft: “Abraham approached, [and he said: Will You destroy even the righteous with the wicked?]” (Genesis 18:23). Likewise, David says: “I acknowledged my sin to You; [I did not hide my iniquity]” (Psalms 32:5). Initially he presented it as one sin and one iniquity, but ultimately he said: “[I said: I will confess my transgressions to the Lord] and You forgave the iniquity of my sin, Selah” (Psalms 32:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">After he was forgiven for one sin and one iniquity, he admitted to multiple transgressions.</i> Likewise, Moses maligned Israel, as it is stated: “Please; this people has sinned a great sin” (Exodus 32:31). When the angels of destruction saw that he was maligning them, they said: ‘We will not need to be involved in maligning. As long as this one is maligning they will fall by his hand, and their patriarchs will not confront us [saying]: Why are you maligning our children.’ The angels of destruction departed. When Moses saw that they had departed, he said to the Holy One blessed be He: “Now, if You will bear their sin…” (Exodus 32:32). He said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘The entire Torah that You gave is [addressed] to me: “The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,”; “speak to the children of Israel”; “command the children of Israel”; “say to the children of Israel.” If they are eradicated, what will I do with Your Torah?’<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">How will I fulfill these commands to communicate the Torah to Israel? </i> That is why he said: “And if not, please erase me from Your book that You have written” (Exodus 32:32). <br>Another matter, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Why are You angry at them? Not that they engaged in idol worship, for You did not command them.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Did I not say in the second commandment: “You shall not have [other gods before Me]”?’ (Exodus 20:3). He said before Him: ‘You did not command them, You commanded me.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The term “you” in the verse “you [<i>lekha</i>] shall not have other gods” is written in the singular. </i> Did You perhaps say to them: You [<i>lakhem</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Plural.</i> shall not have? You commanded me. If I engage in idol worship, “please erase me from Your book.”’ When the Holy One blessed be He saw that he was giving his life on their behalf, He said: ‘For your sake I am giving them the Torah,’ as it is stated: “Write for yourself these matters.” <br>Another matter, “write for yourself” – the ministering angels began saying before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Are You giving Moses license to write whatever he wishes, such that he will say to Israel: I gave you the Torah; it is I who wrote and gave it to you?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Heaven forfend that Moses would do such a thing. And even if he were to do so, he is trustworthy,’<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Even if he were to write something that God did not tell him to write, he would write only something that would accord with the will of God (Rabbi David Luria). </i> as it is stated: “Not so My servant Moses, in all My house he is trustworthy” (Numbers 12:7).

Chapter 48

<b>“Moses said to the children of Israel: See, the Lord has called by name Betzalel, son of Uri, son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Judah. He filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship” (Exodus 35:30–31).</b> <br>“[Moses] assembled [the entire congregation of the children of Israel and said to them” (Exodus 35:1). “See, the Lord has called by name Betzalel” – that is what is written: “A good name is better than fragrant oil, [and the day of death than the day of one’s birth]” (Ecclesiastes 7:1). How far does fragrant oil waft? It is from the inner chamber to the central hall. But a good name travels from one end of the world to the other, as it is stated: “David’s name spread to all the lands” (I Chronicles 14:17). Fragrant oil falls on a corpse and putrefies, as it is stated: “Flies of death putrefy and froth perfumed oil” (Ecclesiastes 10:1). A good name rests on a corpse, and does not putrefy, as it is stated: “He went up and lay on the child” (II Kings 4:34).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Elisha’s good name prevailed, and the dead boy was brought back to life.</i> “And the day of death than the day of one’s birth” (Ecclesiastes 7:1) – the day of a person’s death is greater than the day of his birth. Why? Because on the day he is born a person does not know his actions, but when he dies, he informs the people of his actions.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">His good reputation informs all those who hear of him as to the nature of his actions. </i> That is, “the day of death than the day of one’s birth.” <br>Rabbi Levi said: This is analogous to two ships that set sail on the Great Sea, one departing from the port and one entering the port. Everyone was rejoicing over the one that was departing but not over the one that was entering. There was one clever person there. He said: ‘I see it just the opposite here. There is no reason for everyone to rejoice over the one that is departing from the port, as they do not know what conditions it will have to withstand, what seas it will encounter, what winds it will encounter. But everyone should rejoice over the one that is entering the port, because they know that it returned safely and emerged safely from the sea. So too, when a person is born, one reckons for him the time to death;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">People keep track of how old they are, which is merely an indication of how much of their life has already gone by. </i> when he dies, one reckons for him the time that he lived.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">His life and achievements are celebrated (Rabbi David Luria). Alternatively, time that goes by brings him closer to resurrection (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). </i> In his regard Solomon said: “And the day of death than the day of one’s birth.” <br>“A good name is better than fragrant oil” – the names of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya were better than the anointing oil with which Nadav and Avihu were anointed. Why? These entered to sacrifice, and they emerged burnt; and those entered a fiery furnace and emerged safely. That is, “a good name is better than fragrant oil.”
Another matter: “A good name is better than fragrant oil” – the name of Betzalel was better than fragrant oil. Why? Because the verse publicized him, as it is stated: “See, the Lord has called by name Betzalel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">God Himself testified that Betzalel was worthy of his fine reputation. This is even better than the situation of the sons of Aaron, whose greatness was indicated by the fact that they were anointed with the anointing oil (Maharzu). </i> <br>Another matter: “See, the Lord has called by name” – that is what is written: “To whom would you liken Me that I would be equal?” (Isaiah 40:25). Flesh and blood, if he walks in the dark and a person comes and kindles a lamp for him, need he not be grateful to him? But as [My] creations are sleeping I cause the light to rise for them, and they need not be grateful to Me. That is, “to whom would you liken Me that I would be equal”? <br>Another matter: “To whom would you liken Me that I would be equal” (Isaiah 40:25)? Consequently, “say holy [<i>yomar kadosh</i>]” (Isaiah 40:25).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew, <i>yomar kadosh</i>, could also mean, “Says the Holy One.” In most cases, the verse would say “the utterance of the Lord” or “said the Lord.” Since here it says: “Says the Holy One,” this is expounded to mean: Since there is no one who is My equal, say holy in reference only to Me.</i> <br>“Lift your eyes on High and see: who created these?” (Isaiah 40:26) – in whose merit were they created? “These are the generations of the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 2:4) – in whose merit do they endure? In the merit of: “These are the names of the children of Israel” (Exodus 1:1). And by what merit do those endure? By the merit of: “These are the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances” (Deuteronomy 4:45). <br>“He who brings out their host by number; He calls them all by name” (Isaiah 40:26), and another verse says: “He calls them all by names” (Psalms 147:4). How can these two verses coexist?<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Do the angels all have one name, as implied by the singular term “name” in Isaiah 40:26, or distinct names as implied by the plural term “names” in Psalms 147:4? </i> It is, that when the Holy One blessed be He seeks to call them all at once, He calls them all one name. When He calls each one individually, He calls each by name, Mikhael, Gavriel. That is why it is stated: “He calls them all by names.” I have derived only regarding above, from where is it derived that the same is true below? “See, the Lord has called by name Betzalel.” <br>Another matter: “See, the Lord has called [by name Betzalel, son of Uri, son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Judah]” – it mentions and affirms;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The verse mentions Betzalel’s name and singles him out for an elevated purpose, thereby affirming his worthiness. </i> “with him was Oholiav ben Aḥisamakh [of the tribe of Dan]” (Exodus 38:23) – praise for him, praise for his father, praise for his family, praise for the tribe from which he emerged. And it mentions and demeans: “[The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed…] and the name of his mother was Shelomit daughter of Divri, of the tribe of Dan” (Leviticus 24:11) – disgrace for her, for her father, for her family, and for the tribe from which she emerged. It mentions and affims: “Count the children of Levi [by their fathers’ houses, by their families]” (Numbers 3:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The Levites were being singled out for elevated status, and were to be counted by their fathers’ houses in order to honor their fathers, who were mentioned along with them. </i> It mentions and demeans: “Akhan, son of Carmi, son of Zavdi, son of Zeraḥ, of the tribe of Judah” (Joshua 7:18) – disgrace for him, disgrace for his father and for his family, and disgrace for the tribe from which he descended.
Another matter: “See, the Lord has called by name Betzalel, son of Uri, son of Ḥur” – why did He see fit to mention Ḥur here? It is that when Israel sought to engage in idol worship, he gave his life for the sake of the Holy One blessed be He and did not allow them to do so. They arose and killed him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When Ḥur sought to prevent the Israelites from committing the sin of the Golden Calf, they killed him. See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 41:7. </i> The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘By your life, I will repay you.’ This is analogous to a king whose legions rebelled against him. His captain of the guard stood and battled against them. He said to them: ‘Are you rebelling against the king?’ They arose and killed him. The king said: Had he given me money, would I not be required to repay him? It is true all the more so that he gave his life for my sake. What will I do for him? I will appoint all the descendants who emerge from him as generals and officers. So too, when Israel crafted the calf, Ḥur stood and gave his life for the sake of the Holy One blessed be He. [God] said to him: ‘By your life, all the descendants who emerge from you, I will elevate them and grant them a good name in the world,’ as it is stated: “See, the Lord has called by name Betzalel, [son of Uri, son of Ḥur].… He filled him with the spirit of God.” <br>Not only this one alone, but everyone who engaged in the labor of the Tabernacle, the Holy One blessed be He infused him with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, as it is stated: “All the wise hearted…crafted” (Exodus 36:8). And not [only] people but animals and beasts as well, as it is stated: “[That the Lord infused] them [<i>bahema</i>] with wisdom and understanding” (Exodus 36:1). <i>Behema </i>is written, as wisdom was infused in man and animal [<i>behema</i>]. But of them all, only Betzalel was publicized. That is, “See, the Lord has called by name Betzalel.”
From where [did he merit] all this distinction? From the tribe of Judah.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is implied by the phrase, “Betzalel, son of Uri, son of Ḥur, of the tribe of Judah.” </i> From where did he merit all this wisdom? It was due to the merit of Miriam, as it is stated: “He established houses for them” (Exodus 1:21).<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is stated in reference to God’s reward to the Israelite midwives in Egypt, who refused to implement Pharaoh’s decree to kill the baby boys. The midrash asserts that these midwives were Yokheved and Miriam (see <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:13). </i> What were those houses? They were a house of priesthood and a house of royalty. Yokheved took priesthood and kingdom; Aaron was High Priest, and Moses was king, as it is stated: “He became king in Yeshurun” (Deuteronomy 33:5). Miriam took wisdom, as she produced Betzalel, from whom David, who became king, emerged,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, she was awarded wisdom and royalty. </i> as it is stated: “[Caleb took for himself Efrat], and she bore him Ḥur” (I Chronicles 2:19), and it is written: “David son of [that] nobleman [<i>ish efrati</i>]” (I Samuel 17:12), as he descended from Miriam, who was called Efrat.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Shemot Rabba</i> 1:17, where the midrash asserts that Miriam was also called Efrat. </i> <br>With these three things the world was created, as it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom, established the heavens with understanding. With His knowledge the depths were breached” (Proverbs 3:19–20). And with these three things the Tabernacle was crafted, as it is stated: “I filled him with the spirit of God; with wisdom, with understanding, and with knowledge” (Exodus 31:3). And with these three things the Temple was constructed, as it is stated: “He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali…he was filled with wisdom, understanding, and knowledge” (I Kings 7:14). Likewise, when the Holy One blessed be He will rise to construct it in the future, it will be constructed with these three things, as it is stated: “With wisdom a house is built, and with understanding it is established” (Proverbs 24:3), and it is written: “With knowledge, chambers are filled” (Proverbs 24:4). <br>Another matter: “I filled him […with wisdom]” (Exodus 31:3) – from where was all this wisdom? It was from the Holy One blessed be He, “the spirit of God.” Likewise you find regarding Joshua, who descended from Joseph; what is written in his regard? “Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom” (Deuteronomy 34:9). Likewise you find regarding Otniel ben Kenaz, who descended from Judah; what is written in his regard? “The spirit of the Lord was upon him” (Judges 3:10). All the miracles that were performed on their behalf were due to the blessing with which Moses blessed the tribes, as it is stated: “And this for Judah, and he said” (Deuteronomy 33:7); when they encounter distress, “You will be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7). Another matter: “Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah” (Deuteronomy 33:7) – as the Holy One blessed be He endowed him with a Divine Spirit for prominence, with which he would prevail. <br>Rabbi Ḥanina said: That is what is written: “Indeed, it is a spirit in man” (Job 32:8). All the understanding that was in Betzalel was from the Almighty; that is, “I filled him with the spirit of God; [with wisdom, with understanding, and with knowledge]” (Exodus 31:3). “With wisdom” – as he was wise in Torah; “with understanding” – as he had understanding of <i>halakha</i>; “with knowledge” – as he was filled with knowledge of the Talmud. The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘In this world, My spirit endows you with wisdom, but in the future, My spirit will give you life,’ as it is stated: “I will place My spirit in you, and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:14).
Another matter: “See, the Lord has called by name” – that is what is written: “Behold I created the smith” (Isaiah 54:16) – this is Betzalel. “Who fans the coal flame” (Isaiah 54:16) – Israel sinned with fire, as it is stated: “I cast it in the fire, and this calf emerged” (Exodus 32:24); Betzalel came and healed the wound. This is analogous to a doctor’s apprentice who placed a bandage on a certain wound and it healed, and they were lauding him. His mentor said to them: ‘Laud me, for I taught him.’ So too, everyone was saying that Betzalel with his wisdom and his understanding crafted the Tabernacle. The Holy One blessed be He said: It is I who created him and taught him, as it is stated: “Behold I created the smith.” That is why Moses said: “See, the Lord has called by name.”
Another matter: “See, the Lord has called by name Betzalel” – that is what is written: “I will heal their waywardness; I will love them gratuitously [<i>nedava</i>]” (Hosea 14:5). What is written previously? “The children of Israel brought it as a freewill offering [<i>nedava</i>] to the Lord” (Exodus 35:29). Thereafter, “See, the Lord has called by name, Betzalel.”<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Why does the verse first relate that they brought all the materials and only afterward mention that Betzalel was in charge?</i> It is, that when they crafted the calf, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Now let Me be…[and I will eradicate them]” (Exodus 32:10). He said to Him: ‘Test them; have them craft the Tabernacle.’ What is written in that iniquity? “Remove the gold rings” (Exodus 32:2). What did they bring? They brought rings.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">They donated gold rings for the construction of the Golden Calf. </i> When they crafted the Tabernacle they brought it as a freewill offering. What is written? “Everyone generous of heart brought a bracelet, an earring, a ring, and a girdle” (Exodus 35:22). With rings they sinned and with rings He was reconciled with them. The Divine Spirit called out through Hosea: “It will be that instead of it being said to them: You are not My people, it will be said to them: Children of the living God” (Hosea 2:1). Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You wrote: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for the ox” (Exodus 21:37). They brought five: Bracelet, earring, ring, nose ring, and girdle.”’

Chapter 49

<b>“All the wise hearted among those who performed the labor crafted the Tabernacle: ten tapestries of spun linen and sky blue, purple, and scarlet wool, with artfully-crafted cherubs, they made them” (Exodus 36:8).</b> <br> “All the wise hearted…crafted,” that is what is written: “Many waters cannot extinguish love” (Song of Songs 8:7). “Many waters,” these are the idolaters, as it is written: “[Woe, the uproar of many nations,] like the roar of seas will they roar” (Isaiah 17:12). Were all the idolaters to assemble to void the love between the Holy One blessed be He and Israel, they would be unable to do so. That is, “many waters cannot extinguish love,” as it is stated: “And I loved Jacob” (Malachi 1:2). “And rivers cannot wash it away” (Song of Songs 8:7), these are the Chaldeans, as it is stated: “The mighty and abundant waters of the River upon them, the king of Assyria” (Isaiah 8:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Chaldeans were a part of the Assyrian Empire. When the prophets speak of “the River” it is a reference to the Euphrates. </i> “Were a man to give all the wealth of his house for love, they would scorn him” (Song of Songs 8:7), but My children crafted a Sanctuary of tapestries for Me, and I descended and dwelled in their midst, as it is stated: “Moses was unable to enter the Tent of Meeting…and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle” (Exodus 40:35).
Another matter, “all the wise hearted,” that is what is written: “I am black but comely” (Song of Songs 1:5). If black, why comely? Is there one who is black and comely? Rather, the congregation of Israel said: ‘I am black in my actions, but I am comely in the actions of my ancestors. I was black in Egypt, but I was comely when I said at Sinai: “Everything that the Lord speaks we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). I was black at the sea, as it stated: “They were defiant at the sea, the Red Sea” (Psalms 106:7), but I was comely when I said: “This is my God and I will exalt Him” (Exodus 15:2). I am black due to the crafting of the calf, but I am comely due to the crafting of the Tabernacle. I am black with a bull, as it is stated: “They exchanged their Glory for the image of a bull” (Psalms 106:20), but I am comely with a bull, “a bull, a lamb, or a goat” (Leviticus 17:3). I am black in the Tabernacle, as it is stated: “They defiled My Sanctuary” (Ezekiel 23:38), but I am comely in the Tabernacle.’ <br>“All the wise hearted…crafted.” What labor did they perform? See what is written: “This is the gift [<i>teruma</i>] that you shall take from them: [Gold, silver, and bronze]” (Exodus 25:3). This is the congregation of Israel, which is a gift, as it is stated: “Israel is sacred to the Lord, the first of His crop” (Jeremiah 2:3).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Teruma </i>taken from produce is also referred to as the first of the crop (e.g., Numbers 18:11–12).</i> “Gold and silver,” this is the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Wings of the dove covered with silver, [its pinions with green and gold]” (Psalms 68:14). “And bronze,” this is the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “And from its mountains you will hew bronze” (Deuteronomy 8:9). “Sky blue [wool],” this is the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “They shall place on the fringe of the corner a sky blue thread” (Numbers 15:38). “Purple [<i>argaman</i>], and scarlet wool [<i>tolaat shani</i>],” this is the congregation of Israel, as it is stated: “Fear not, worm [<i>tolaat</i>] of Jacob” (Isaiah 41:14), and likewise: “Your lips are like a scarlet thread” (Song of Songs 4:3). And it says: “The princes of Judah in their throng [<i>rigmatam</i>]” (Psalms 68:28).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, the labor was to understand the hidden significance in each detail of the Tabernacle, as in the examples cited here in the midrash. Alternatively, the people of Israel themselves were meant to be the primary address of the Divine Presence, and the job of those performing the labor was to prepare them to be absolutely dedicated to divine service (see <i>Etz Yosef</i>; <i>Midrash HaMevoar</i>). </i> <br>Another matter, “gold,” this is Abraham, who was tested in the fiery furnace like gold. “And silver,” this is Isaac, who was purified like silver upon the altar. “And bronze [<i>neḥoshet</i>],” this is Jacob, as it is stated: “I have divined [<i>niḥashti</i>], and God has blessed me on your account” (Genesis 30:27).

Chapter 50

<b>“Betzalel crafted the Ark of acacia wood: its length was two and a half cubits, its width a cubit and a half, and its height a cubit and a half” (Exodus 37:1).</b> <br>“Betzalel crafted the Ark.” That is what is written: “Your opening words enlighten; they bring understanding to the simple” (Psalms 119:130). When the Holy One blessed be He created His world it was entirely water, as it is stated: “And darkness on the surface of the deep…[and God said: Let there be light]” (Genesis 1:2). Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda said: Light was created first and then the world. This is analogous to a king who sought to build a palace, but the site was dark. What did he do? He kindled lamps and torches to determine where to position the rows of building stones. So too, the light was created first. Rabbi Neḥemya said: The world was created first. This is analogous to a king who built a palace and adorned it with lamps. <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, he said to him: ‘Because I have heard about you, that you are an aggadic master, from where was the light created?’ He said: ‘The Holy One blessed be He wrapped Himself in a garment and illuminated the entire world from His aura from its beginning to its end, as it is written: “Covers Himself with light like a garment” (Psalms 104:2), and then “spread the heavens like a tapestry” (Psalms 104:2). Therefore, “Your opening words enlighten.”’ From Him the righteous learned that when they would begin a matter, they would begin with light. You find that when the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses that he should craft the Tabernacle, Betzalel said: ‘With what shall I begin?’ He began with the Ark, as it is stated: “They shall craft an Ark” (Exodus 25:10).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Ark housed the Tablets and a Torah, and Torah is compared to light (see Proverbs 6:23). </i>
That is what is written: “Give to the wise person, and he will grow wiser” (Proverbs 9:9), this is Noah, as the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “From every pure animal, take for yourself seven of each, [a male and his mate; and of the animals that are not pure, two, a male and his mate]” (Genesis 7:2). When he emerged, what is written? “He built an altar to the Lord” (Genesis 8:20). What is “he built [<i>vayiven</i>]”? He scrutinized [<i>hitbonen</i>] and said: ‘For what reason did the Holy One blessed be He increase the number of the pure relative to the impure? Is it not that He wished that I sacrifice to Him from them?’ Immediately, “he took from each species of pure animal [and offered burnt-offerings on the altar]” (Genesis 8:20). That is, “give to the wise person, and he will grow wiser,” because the wise man hears something, fulfills it, and adds to it. <br>Another matter, “give to the wise person, and he will grow wiser,” this is Moses, as it is stated: “The wise goes up to the city of the mighty” (Proverbs 21:22), as he would study Torah from the mouth of the Almighty, and he would come and tell it to Israel and benefit them, and he would give them more life. That is, “give to the wise person, and he will grow wiser.” <br>Another matter, “give to the wise person,” this is Betzalel. You find that when the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Craft the Tabernacle,’ he came and related it to Betzalel. [Betzalel] said to him: ‘What is [the purpose of] this Tabernacle?’ He said to him: ‘It is so the Holy One blessed be He will rest His Divine Presence in it and will teach Israel Torah.’ Betzalel said to him: ‘Where will the Torah be placed?’ He said to him: ‘After we craft the Tabernacle, we will craft the Ark.’ He said to him: ‘Our master, Moses. It is not in keeping with the honor due the Torah to do so; rather, we will craft the Ark and the Tabernacle thereafter.’ That is why it was called by his name: “Betzalel crafted the Ark.”
Another matter, “Betzalel crafted” – that is what is written: “I will bring a remedy for you” (Jeremiah 30:17). The attributes of the Holy One blessed be He are not like the attributes of flesh and blood. The attribute of flesh and blood is to wound with a chisel and heal with a bandage. But the Holy One blessed be He heals with that with which He wounds, as it is stated: “They arrived in Mara and were unable to drink water from Mara” (Exodus 15:23). Why? “Because it was bitter [<i>marim</i>]” (Exodus 15:23). Rabbi Levi said: That generation was bitter in its actions. “He cried out to the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree” (Exodus 15:25). What was it? Some say it was an olive tree, some say it was a willow, some say it was oleander, and some say it was the roots of fig trees and the roots of pomegranate trees.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">All of these materials are bitter. </i> He took it and cast it into the water. Immediately, the water sweetened. That is, “and from your wounds I will heal you” (Jeremiah 30:17). <br>Likewise you find with the water of Elisha, what is written? “The water is bad and the land causes bereavement” (II Kings 2:19). He said to them: “Bring me a new flask and place salt in it, and they brought it to him” (II Kings 2:20). What is written? “The water was cured to this day, in accordance with the word of Elisha that he spoke” (II Kings 2:22). <br>Likewise you find regarding Israel; he rebuked them with [the word] ‘therefore,’ as it is stated: “Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of the Lord” (Ezekiel 16:35), and with [the word] ‘therefore’ He is destined to restore them. as it is stated: “Therefore, behold, I will seduce her” (Hosea 2:16), and one seduces only a virgin. As it is stated: “If a man seduces a virgin” (Exodus 22:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, although Israel is compared to a prostitute by Ezekiel, eventually they are compared to a virgin, who has not experienced sin. </i> So, too, Israel sinned in Shittim. As it is stated: “Israel were residing in Shittim [and the people began to engage in licentiousness]” (Numbers 25:1), and they were healed with <i>shittim</i>, as it is stated: “Betzalel crafted the Ark of acacia wood [<i>atzei shittim</i>].”
What is written previously? “He crafted the curtain of sky blue, purple [and scarlet wool]” (Exodus 36:35). Our Rabbis taught that the thickness of the curtain was one handbreadth, and it was woven on seventy-two heddles and had no knots. They would craft two each and every year, and three hundred priests would immerse it. The priests would descend and immerse it outside,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">In a ritual bath on the Temple Mount outside the Temple courtyard.</i> and they would ascend and spread it atop the rampart. <br>You find that the entire Tabernacle was crafted in order. Initially, he crafted the beams and connected them; then, the tapestries and he spread them upon it, as it is stated: “He crafted tapestries of goats’ hair as a tent over the Tabernacle” (Exodus 36:14). Then he crafted the curtain that would be spread before the Ark. Then he crafted the Ark and the Ark cover that would be placed upon the Ark. Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Yosei said: ‘I saw the curtain in Rome and there were several drops of blood on it. I asked and they said to me that it was from the blood of the Yom Kippur service that the priest would perform.’ Why is it called <i>kaporet</i>? It is because it would atone [<i>mekhaper</i>] for Israel. After he crafted the Ark cover, he crafted the table upon which the showbread was placed, which was positioned before the Ark. Then he crafted the candelabrum that was positioned above the table.
Another matter, “Betzalel crafted” – did Betzalel craft it all himself, that regarding each and every item it says: “Betzalel crafted”? Rather, because he was exceedingly devoted to it, the Holy One blessed be He did not withhold his reward and the verse mentions him regarding each and every item. <br>On a similar note, you say: “Only Yonatan son of Asael, and Yahzeya son of Tikva, insisted on this, and Meshulam and Shabetai the Levite assisted them” (Ezra 10:15). Yonatan was exceedingly devoted to this matter, and because they came and assisted him, the Holy One blessed be He ascribed to them as though they performed the act. But because Yonatan devoted himself to the matter, the verse mentioned him.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The verse mentioned him and Yahzeya as the primary doers because they were especially devoted to the task.</i> <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘You crafted tapestries of goats’ hair, I will protect you in the World to Come with a cloud,’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Because you crafted tapestries of goat hair, which were placed atop the Tabernacle and protected the more delicate coverings underneath it, I will protect you with a cloud in the World to Come. </i> as it is stated: “The Lord will create a cloud by day” (Isaiah 4:5). ‘You crafted an Ark cover [<i>kaporet</i>], I will grant atonement [<i>mekhaper</i>] for your iniquities. You crafted a table,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">There was an arrangement of showbread on the table.</i> I will save you from the arrangement,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to future punishment of the wicked, as in the verse: “For an inferno is arranged from yesterday” (Isaiah 30:33). </i> and I will set a table before you in the future. You crafted a candelabrum before Me, I will illuminate for you sevenfold in the World to Come,’ as it is stated: “The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold” (Isaiah 30:26). ‘You crafted an Ark before Me in which the Torah is placed. I will give you endless reward,’ as it is stated: “How great is the goodness You have stored for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20). <br> <br>

Chapter 51

<b>“These are the reckonings of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Testimony, as they were reckoned at the directive of Moses: the service of the Levites was by means of Itamar, son of Aaron the priest” (Exodus 38:21).</b> <br>“These are the reckonings of the Tabernacle.” Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba began as follows: “A man of trust will abound with blessings” (Proverbs 28:20) – you find that anyone who is trustworthy, the Holy One blessed be He brings blessings through him. Of one who is not trustworthy it is stated: “But one who hastens to become rich will not be absolved” (Proverbs 28:20). “A man of trust” – this is Moses, who is the trusted one of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Not so is My servant Moses; in My entire house he is trusted” (Numbers 12:7). That is, “a man of trust will abound with blessings,” as all the matters over which he was appointed executor would be blessed, because he was trustworthy. “But one who hastens to become rich will not be absolved” – this is Koraḥ, who was a Levite and sought to take the high priesthood. What was his end? “The earth opened its mouth [and swallowed them up]” (Numbers 16:32). <br>Another matter: “A man of trust” (Proverbs 28:20) – this is Moses, who became the executor for the labor of the Tabernacle. Our Rabbis taught: One does not appoint an authority over the public in monetary matters that is fewer than two [people],<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Shekalim</i> 5:2. </i> but you find that Moses was executor himself, and yet you say: One does not appoint fewer than two? Rather, even though Moses was executor himself, he would call others and calculate with them, as it is stated: “These are the reckonings of the Tabernacle.” It is not written here, “as Moses reckoned,” but rather, “as they were reckoned at the directive of Moses” – by means of Moses, “by means of Itamar.”
In his regard it is stated: “They did not require a reckoning from the men [by whose hand] they gave the silver [to give to the workmen, as they acted with trustworthiness]” (II Kings 12:16).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This is describing the situation in the reign of Yoash, king of Judah, but the midrash applies it to Moses.</i> “They did not require a reckoning” – this was in the generation of Yoash, when they would act with trustworthiness. Our Rabbis taught: The one who would enter to collect from the chamber would not enter while wearing a cuffed garment or with a soft shoe, for if he would [do so and] become wealthy they might say he became rich from the collection of the chamber. As, a person must pass [the scrutiny] of people just as he must pass [the scrutiny] of the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “And you shall be vindicated before the Lord and before Israel” (Numbers 32:22).<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Mishna <i>Shekalim</i> 3:2. </i> Yet Moses was the executor of the labor of the Tabernacle by himself. It is because when the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses to craft the Tabernacle, immediately, “Every man [whose heart inspired him] came…[and brought the gift of the Lord for the labor of the Tent of Meeting]” (Exodus 35:21). In how many days did they bring all the gifts? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They brought it in two mornings,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This is based on the double usage of the Hebrew term for morning in Exodus 32:3. </i> and there was a surplus, as it is stated: “The labor was sufficient…[and beyond]” (Exodus 36:7).<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Because the funds were raised so quickly, Moses did not have time to appoint additional executors (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). Alternatively, although Moses was the sole executor his behavior was beyond suspicion, as he announced that people should stop bringing gifts because there was already enough material (Exodus 36:6), and yet he still made a reckoning of what had been done with the materials together with others, as the midrash understands based on Exodus 38:21 (Maharzu). </i> Moses came to Betzalel and saw that he had a surplus [of materials] from the Tabernacle. He said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, we performed the labor of the Tabernacle and have a surplus. What shall we do with the surplus?’ He said to him: ‘Go and craft with them a tabernacle for the Testimony.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Construct a tent for the Ark, within the Tabernacle (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>). Alternatively, construct a tent similar to the Tabernacle outside the camp, to which people will go to study Torah (see Rabbi David Luria; Maharzu). </i> Moses went and he crafted it with [the surplus materials]. When he came to give a reckoning, he said to them: ‘Such and such was expended for the Tabernacle, and with the surplus I crafted a tabernacle for the Testimony.’ That is, “these are the reckonings of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Testimony.”
Why [is the word] Tabernacle [<i>mishkan</i>] stated twice? Rabbi Shmuel bar Marta said: It was twice taken as collateral [<i>nitmashken</i>] on their account.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The reference here is to the two Temples in Jerusalem, and the derivation from the Tabernacle is because the Tabernacle was a precursor to the Temple. Both Temples were destroyed due to the sins of the people, instead of the people themselves being destroyed. In that sense, it is comparable to one who collects a debt from the collateral given by the borrower rather than from the borrower himself. </i> That is what the members of the Great Assembly say: “We have done injury to You, and have not observed the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances” (Nehemiah 1:7). What is “we have done injury [<i>ḥavol ḥavalnu</i>] to You”? That is that it was twice taken as collateral. <i>Ḥavol </i>is nothing other than collateral, as it is stated: “One shall not take as collateral [<i>lo yaḥavol</i>] the lower millstone or the upper millstone” (Deuteronomy 24:6). That is why, in the verse “these are the reckonings of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Testimony,” it is written twice.
What is “the Testimony”? Rabbi Shmuel ben Rabbi Yishmael said: It is testimony for all who enter the world that there is forgiveness for Israel. Alternatively, it is testimony for the entire world that [Moses] was appointed by the Holy One blessed be He.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The fact that God rested His presence in the Tabernacle was an indication that He had forgiven Israel for the sin of the Golden Calf. Alternatively, it was an indication that He had commanded the construction of the Tabernacle, in contrast to the view of those who thought God would never have issued such a command because a finite space cannot contain the presence of an infinite God (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> <br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: To what is this matter comparable? To a king who took a wife and loved her exceedingly. He became angry at her and left her, and her neighbors would say to her: ‘He will never come back to you.’ Sometime later, he sent to her and said: ‘Sweep my palace and make the beds, as on such and such day I will come to you.’ When that day arrived, the king came to her and reconciled with her. He entered the palace [and came] to her, and ate and drank with her. Her neighbors did not believe it. When they smelled the fragrance of perfume, they knew that the king had reconciled with her. So too, the Holy One blessed be He loved Israel and brought them before Mount Sinai. He gave them the Torah and called them a kingdom of priests, as it is stated: “You will be for Me a kingdom of priests” (Exodus 19:6). Forty days later, they sinned. At that moment, the idolaters said: He will never again be reconciled with them, as it is stated: “They said among the nations: They will not reside here anymore” (Lamentations 4:15). When Moses went to ask for mercy for them, the Holy One blessed be He immediately forgave them, as it is stated: “The Lord said: “I have forgiven in accordance with your statement” (Numbers 14:20). Moses said: ‘Master of the universe, I am satisfied that You have pardoned Israel, but proclaim before the eyes of all the nations that there is no residual resentment in Your heart against them.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, I will rest My Divine Presence in their midst,’ as it is stated: “They shall craft a Sanctuary for Me [and I will dwell among them]” (Exodus 25:8), ‘and they will recognize that I have pardoned them.’ That is, “the Tabernacle of Testimony,” as it is testimony for Israel that the Holy One blessed be He has pardoned them.
Another matter: “The Tabernacle of Testimony” – Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: When Hadrian entered the chamber of the Holy of Holies, he was acting with arrogance there and blaspheming God. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: David said: ‘Master of the universe, may it be considered before You in this way: Had they been able to chop down cedars and fashion ladders, they would have ascended on High.’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">David asked God to consider the actions of Hadrian and his men as though they had actually waged war directly against God. </i> From where is it derived? As it is written: “Let it be known as bringing axes upward in a thicket of trees” (Psalms 74:5). ‘However, they are unable to do so, and they leave You and come upon us,’ as it is written: “They devised a plot, but they are unable” (Psalms 21:12). ‘They come upon us,’ as it is stated: “God, nations have entered Your inheritance, [they have defiled Your holy Temple.… They have given the corpses of Your servants as food to birds of the heavens, the flesh of Your devoted ones to beasts of the field]” (Psalms 79:1–2). ‘Why did all this transpire? It is because it was taken as collateral on our account,’ as it is stated: “These are the reckonings of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Testimony.” <br>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: To what are idolaters comparable? To a person who was an enemy of the king and sought to overcome him but was unable to do so. What did he do? He went to a statue [of the king] and sought to topple it, but he feared that the king would kill him. What did he do? He took a bronze chisel and began undermining the wall that was beneath it. He said: By toppling the foundation, the statue will fall. So too, idolaters come to attack the Holy One blessed be He but are unable to do so, so they come and attack Israel. Likewise, David said: “The kings of the earth have assembled, and rulers are gathered together against the Lord and against His anointed one” (Psalms 2:2), but they are unable to do so. What do they do? They attack Israel. What is written thereafter? “Let us snap off their chains [and throw off their bonds]” (Psalms 2:3) – let us uproot [Israel] from the world. When? When they have nothing to give as collateral [<i>lemashken</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">If Israel had nothing to give as collateral, they would be uprooted from the world. </i> But the Tabernacle served as collateral for them. That is, “These are the reckonings of the Tabernacle [<i>hamishkan</i>].” Do not read it in that way, but rather, the collateral<i> </i>[<i>hamashkon</i>].
“The Tabernacle of the Testimony, as they were reckoned at the directive of Moses” – everything that they were doing, they were doing at the directive of Moses, as it is stated: “As they were reckoned at the directive of Moses.” And everything that Moses would do, he would do by means of others,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">He would do it together with others and not by himself. </i> as it is stated: “The service of the Levites was by means of Itamar, son of Aaron the priest.” He did it only in this way: When the labor of the Sanctuary was completed, he said to them: ‘Come and I will make an accounting before you.’ Moses said to them: “These are the reckonings of the Tabernacle”; such and such was expended on the Tabernacle. While he was sitting and calculating, he forgot the one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels from which he crafted the hooks for the pillars. He began sitting and wondering. He said: Now Israel will find justification to say that Moses took them. What did [God] do? The Holy One blessed be He enlightened his eyes, and he saw that they were crafted into hooks for the pillars. At that moment, all of Israel was satisfied regarding the labor of the Tabernacle. What caused this? It was that [Moses] sat and satisfied them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Moses reviewed the expenditures undertaken in constructing the Tabernacle, and therefore the entire nation was satisfied with his honesty. </i> That is, “these are the reckonings of the Tabernacle.” <br>Why did he make an accounting with them [if] the Holy One blessed be He trusted him, as it is stated: “Not so is My servant Moses; in My entire house he is trusted” (Numbers 12:7). Why did Moses say: ‘Come let us engage in the Tabernacle and calculate before you?’ It is because Moses heard the cynics of the generation speaking behind his back, as it is stated: “It would be when Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and would stand at the entrance to the tent, and He would speak with Moses” (Exodus 33:9); “and they would gaze after Moses” (Exodus 33:8). What would they say? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Happy is the one who bore this man. What does she see in him? That all his days, the Holy One blessed be He speaks with him; all his days he is faultless with the Holy One blessed be He. That is, “they gazed after Moses.” Rabbi Ḥama said: They would say: Look at the nape of the son of Amram.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The cynics would claim that Moses’ nape was thick, indicating a life of wealth and indulgence.</i> Another says to him: ‘The person who controlled the labor of the Tabernacle, would you not expect him to be wealthy?’ When Moses heard this, Moses said to them: ‘As you live, when the Tabernacle is completed, I will make an accounting for you.’ He said to them: ‘Come, let us make an accounting.’ That is, “these are the reckonings of the Tabernacle.”
“The Tabernacle of Testimony” – what is “the Testimony”? This is the Torah in which they toil. God said: Due to the merit of the Torah and the merit of the offerings, I will rescue you from Gehenna. Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He showed Abraham the Torah, Gehenna, the offerings, and the exiles, as it is stated: “Behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between those pieces” (Genesis 15:17). These are Torah and Gehenna, as it is stated: “The entire people was seeing the thunder, the flames, the blast of the shofar, and the mountain smoking, and the people saw and trembled and stood at a distance” (Exodus 20:15).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Thus, fire and smoke are associated with Torah. Fire and smoke are associated with Gehenna as well; see Isaiah 30:33 and 31:9.</i> From where are the offerings derived? As it is written: “A three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon” (Genesis 15:9). From where are the exiles derived? As it is stated: “Fear, [a great darkness, fell upon him]” (Genesis 15:12). “Fear [<i>eima</i>]” – this is Babylon, as it is stated; “[For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, the bitter and impetuous nation.…] It is terrifying [<i>ayom</i>] and awesome; from it will emerge its law and its prominence” (Habakkuk 1:6–7).<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonians are also called Chaldeans. </i> “Darkness” – this is Media, which darkened the eyes of Israel with its edicts. “Great” – this is Greece, as it is stated: “The goat became exceedingly great, and as it became powerful, the great horn was broken, and in its place, there were four conspicuous horns toward the four winds of the heavens” (Daniel 8:8). “Fell upon him” – this is Edom, as it is stated: “[Hear the counsel of the Lord that He took against Edom.…] From the sound of their fall, the earth quaked” (Jeremiah 49:21). <br>The Holy One blessed be He said: All the days that your descendants will be engaged in Torah study and offerings, they will be saved from them; however, your descendants are destined to abrogate the offerings. By what means do you wish your descendants to be subjugated, by Gehenna or by exile? Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Abraham chose exile. From where is it derived? As it is stated: “If not that their rock had sold them” (Deuteronomy 32:30) – this is Abraham, as it is stated: “Look to the rock from which you were hewn” (Isaiah 51:1). “And the Lord had handed them over” (Deuteronomy 32:30) – that the Holy One blessed be He agreed after him. Rav Huna said in the name of Rav Aḥa, and a different elder in the name of Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi]: Abraham stood wondering and did not know what he should choose, until the Holy One blessed be He said to him that he should choose exile, as it is stated: “You let people ride over our heads” (Psalms 66:12) – You subjugate us by exile. “We went through fire and water” (Psalms 66:12) – this is Gehenna, half of which is fire and half of which is hail, “but You took us out to comfort” (Psalms 66:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">God saved us from Gehenna by sending us into exile. </i> That is, “these are the reckonings of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.” What is “the Testimony”? As long as Israel engages in Torah study and offerings, it will be testimony for them that they will not descend to Gehenna.
Another matter: “These are the reckonings of the Tabernacle” – what are “these”? When the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah to Israel, they did not warrant having the angel of death have dominion over them, as it is stated: “Engraved [<i>ḥarut</i>] on the tablets” (Exodus 32:16). What is <i>ḥarut</i>? Rabbi Yehuda says: Freedom [<i>ḥerut</i>] from exile. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Freedom from the angel of death. Rabbi Pinḥas ben Ḥama said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The Holy One blessed be He said: Were the angel of death to come and say to Me: Why was I created? I would say to him: I created you as a sentinel over the idolaters, but not over My children, as when they received the Torah, the Holy One blessed be He adorned them with the aura of His splendor. <br>What was the adornment? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He adorned them with crowns. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: He gave them weapons, and the great Name was inscribed on it. As long as it was in their possession, the angel of death had no dominion over them. From where do you derive this? It is from what is written there: “Now remove your ornament from upon you, [and I will know what to do with you]” (Exodus 33:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This verse, stated in the aftermath of the sin of the Golden Calf, implies that as long as they had these ornaments they could not be punished with death. </i> Rabbi Sisa said: He adorned them in a royal purple garment. Rabbi Huna says: He adorned them with belts. <br>When they sinned, the Holy One blessed be He removed all that goodness from them, as it is stated: “The children of Israel were stripped of their ornament from Mount Ḥorev” (Exodus 33:6). This mountain was called three names: The mountain of God, Mount Ḥorev, and Mount Sinai. Why the mountain of God? Because it was there that the Holy One blessed be He made known His godliness. Why Sinai? Because he despised [<i>sana</i>] the residents of the upper world and loved the residents of the lower world. Why Ḥorev? Because it was there that the Torah, which is called a sword [<i>ḥerev</i>], was given, as it is stated: “Exaltation of the Almighty is in their throats, and a double-edged sword is in their hand” (Psalms 149:6). <br>Moses was on Sinai receiving the Torah. They went to Aaron and said to him: “[Arise and] craft us a god that will go before us, because this man Moses, who took us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him” (Exodus 32:1). Aaron said to them: Yesterday, you said: “Everything that God spoke we will perform” (Exodus 19:8), and now you are saying: “Arise and craft us a god”? He saw that they had killed Ḥur and he was afraid. He said to them: “Remove the gold [<i>zahav</i>] rings” (Exodus 32:2). Immediately, “[all the people] removed [the gold rings]” (Exodus 32:3), and the entire people was giving him until he said to them: It is enough for you [<i>dayekhem</i>]. So, Moses rebuked them: “Lavan, Ḥatzerot, and Di-Zahav” (Deuteronomy 1:1). This is analogous to a young man who entered a city. He saw them collecting charity, and they said to him: Give, and he gave, until they said to him: It is enough for you. So too, Israel gave gold for the calf until [Aaron] said to them: Enough, and they donated gold for the Tabernacle until [Moses] said to them: Enough, as it is stated: “[Moses commanded, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying: Let neither man nor woman perform any more labor for the gifts of the Sanctuary; and the people ceased bringing.] The labor was sufficient for all the labor to perform it, and beyond” (Exodus 36:6–7). The Holy One blessed be He said: Let the gold of the Tabernacle come and atone for the gold of the calf. <br>The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: When you crafted the calf, you angered Me with: “This [<i>eleh</i>] is your god” (Exodus 32:4). Now that you have crafted the Tabernacle, with these [<i>be’eleh</i>] I am reconciled with you. That is, “these are the reckonings of the Tabernacle.” The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: In this world, with these [<i>eleh</i>] I reconciled with you. Likewise in the future, as it is stated: “Behold, these [<i>eleh</i>] will come from afar, and behold, these [<i>eleh</i>] from the north and from the west, and those [<i>ve’eleh</i>] from the land of Sinim” (Isaiah 49:12). And it says: “Who are these [<i>eleh</i>] who fly like a cloud and like doves to their cotes?” (Isaiah 60:8). <br>

Chapter 52

<b>“They brought the Tabernacle to Moses: The Tent and all its vessels, its hooks, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets” (Exodus 39:33).</b> <br>“They brought the Tabernacle to Moses.” Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba began: “In embroidery she is led to the king; her virgin companions follow her, brought to you” (Psalms 45:15). What is “in embroidery”? This is the Tabernacle that is embroidered, as it is written: “And an embroiderer in sky blue wool” (Exodus 38:23). That is “in embroidery.” What is “she is led to the king”? This is Moses, who was called king, as it is written: “He became king in Yeshurun, when the heads of the people were assembled, the tribes of Israel together” (Deuteronomy 33:5). “She is led,” this is that they brought him the Tabernacle. “Her virgin companions follow her,” this is Israel, who were called virgins, as it is written: “A locked garden is my sister, my bride; a locked fountain, a sealed spring” (Song of Songs 4:12).<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The imagery of the locked garden and fountain and the sealed spring represents virginity; one who has protected herself from exploitation. The point is that Israel remained unblemished by refraining from idolatry (<i>Yefei To’ar</i>). </i> “Her companions,” as they are the companions of the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “For the sake of my brothers and companions, I now say: Peace be with you” (Psalms 122:8). “Brought to you” – on the day that the Tabernacle was completed, they brought it to him. That is why it is stated: “They brought the Tabernacle to Moses.”
Another matter, “they brought the Tabernacle” – that is what is written: “Mute the lying lips that speak falsehood [<i>atak</i>] against the righteous with arrogance and contempt” (Psalms 31:19). How so? A person confesses on Yom Kippur; if another Yom Kippur comes and he mentions his [past] iniquities, the Holy One blessed be He says to him: ‘Mute the lying lips.’ What is <i>atak</i>? Matters that have already passed, like that which is stated: “He relocated [<i>vayatek</i>] from there to the mountain, east of Beit El, and he pitched his tent, Beit El to the west, and Ai to the east; he built there an altar to the Lord, and proclaimed the name of the Lord” (Genesis 12:8). “With arrogance and contempt” – the Holy One blessed be He says to him: ‘Did you have no sins from this year that you boasted “with arrogance and contempt”?’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Confessing sins from a previous year is arrogant in that it implies that one has no current sins to confess. </i> <br>Another matter, “mute the lying lips” is speaking of Moses. When the Holy One blessed be He said to craft for Him a Tabernacle, Moses immediately said to Israel: “Let them bring Me a gift” (Exodus 25:2). Moses was involved in the Tabernacle, and the cynics of Israel were saying: ‘Is it possible that the Divine Presence will rest by means of the son of Amram?’ Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He was involved with the Tabernacle for six months. They crafted it in three months and they folded it up for three months. Nevertheless, they were mocking him, and saying: ‘It has been crafted, did Moses not say that His Divine Presence would rest in our midst?’<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Despite the fact that the construction of the Tabernacle in only three months would not have been possible without divine assistance, the cynics still expressed their cynicism due to the fact that it was not yet assembled and the Divine Presence was not yet apparent (<i>Yefei To’ar</i>). </i> But the Holy One blessed be He intended to set up the Tabernacle in the month that Isaac our patriarch was born. He did not act,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">God did not command Moses to assemble the Tabernacle for three months after its construction. </i> but when that month arrived the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “On the day of the first month, on the first of the month, you shall erect the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting” (Exodus 40:2). At that moment, the Divine Spirit said: “Mute the lying lips,” those mocking him. He did not act,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Moses did not act on his own. </i> but when the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses to erect the Tabernacle, [the people] began to carry it, each and every one of them [the product of] his labor, as it is stated: “They brought the Tabernacle to Moses.”
“They brought the Tabernacle” – that is what is written: “Might and grandeur are her garment, and she laughs at the final day” (Proverbs 31:25). What is “at the final day”? It is that all the reward of the righteous is prepared for them in the World to Come. That is, “she laughs at the final day.” There was an incident involving Rabbi Abahu who was departing from the world and saw all the good that was prepared for him in the World to Come. He began rejoicing and said: ‘All this is for Abahu? “But I said: For nothing I labored, I expended my strength for emptiness and futility; indeed, my portion is from the Lord and my accomplishment is from my God”’ (Isaiah 49:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">He had thought that he was undeserving.</i> That is, “she laughs at the final day.” <br>Another matter, when is the Torah favorable [<i>mesaḥeket</i>] for one who toils in it? On the final day, as it is stated: “She laughs [<i>vatisḥak</i>] at the final day.” Zavdi ben Levi, Rabbi Yosei ben Patros, and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, each and every one of them recited a verse at the moment of their departure from the world. One of them recited: “Therefore, everyone who is pious to You should pray at the time of searching, so the torrent of mighty waters does not reach him” (Psalms 32:6). One recited: “How great is Your goodness that You have in store for those who fear You, which You have created for those taking refuge in You, to be bestowed before the people” (Psalms 31:20). And one recited: “For our heart rejoices in Him” (Psalms 33:21). That is [proof] that at the time of departure of the righteous, the Holy One blessed be He shows them the reward that they are given and causes them to rejoice. <br>Ben Azai said: “Weighty [<i>yakar</i>] in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His pious ones” (Psalms 116:15). When does the Holy One blessed be He inform the righteous of the honor [<i>yekar</i>] that is prepared for them? It is adjacent to their death, as it is stated: “The death of His pious ones.” At that moment they see and laugh. That is why, “she laughs at the final day.” There was an incident involving a certain disciple of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai who went out of the Land of Israel and returned wealthy. The disciples would see him and envy him, and they, too, sought, to go out of the Land of Israel. Rabbi Shimon knew and he took them to a certain valley near Meron. He prayed, saying: ‘Valley, valley, fill with gold dinars!’ It began flowing with gold dinars before them. He said to them: ‘If it is gold you seek, here is gold, take it for yourselves; however, know that anyone who takes now, it is his portion of the World to Come that he is taking, as the reward for Torah is given only in the World to Come.’ That is, “she laughs at the final day.” <br>There was an incident involving Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta who arrived [home] on the day before Shabbat and he did not have a source of sustenance.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He did not have enough money to buy food for Shabbat. </i> He exited the city and prayed before God and he was given a gem from the heavens. He gave it to a money changer and bought provisions for that Shabbat. His wife said: ‘From where are these [provisions]?’ He said: ‘From the sustenance provided by the Holy One blessed be He.’ She said to him: ‘If you do not tell me where they are from, I will not taste anything.’ He began relating to her, he said to her: ‘This is how I prayed before God, and it was given me from the heavens.’ She said to him: ‘I will not taste anything until you say to me that you will return it at the conclusion of Shabbat.’ He said to her: ‘Why?’ She said to him: ‘Would you like your table to be lacking and the table of your colleagues intact?’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Do you want to be lacking in the World to Come? </i> Rabbi Shimon went and informed Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] of the incident. He said to him: ‘Tell her that if your table is lacking, I will complete it from my portion.’ He went and told it to her. She said to him: ‘Go with me to the one who taught you Torah.’ She said to him: ‘Rabbi, does a person see his counterpart in the World to Come? Does each and every righteous one not have a world to himself, as it is stated: “For the man goes to his eternal [<i>olamo</i>] home, and the mourners will circle in the streets” (Ecclesiastes 12:5)? <i>Olamim </i>is not written, but rather, <i>olamo</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The singular term is used rather than the plural, indicating that each righteous individual sees only his own eternal home and not multiple eternal homes. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi could not refute the argument of Rabbi Shimon’s wife. </i> When [Rabbi Shimon] heard that, he went to return it. Our Rabbis say, the latter miracle was greater than the former. When he extended his hand to return it, immediately, an angel descended and took it from him. Why? Because the reward for Torah is given only in the World to Come, for the final day. That is, “she laughs at the final day.” <br>Another matter, “might and grandeur are her garment” – this is Moses, as it is stated: “Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant” (Exodus 34:29). “She laughs at the final day,” these are the cynics of Israel, who mocked him and said to one another: ‘Is it possible that the Divine Presence will rest by means of the son of Amram?’ He did not act,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Moses did not respond to their mocking (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> but when God said to him to erect the Tabernacle, he began laughing at them, as it is stated: “She laughs at the final day.” He said to them: ‘Come, let us erect the Tabernacle.’ They began to carry it and come to him, as it is stated: “They brought the Tabernacle.”
There were numerous wise men there, and they came to Moses, but they were unable to erect it. As Solomon said: “Many daughters have performed valiantly, but you have surpassed [<i>alit</i>] them all” (Proverbs 31:29); as Moses was the most excellent [<i>meuleh</i>] of them all. “But you have surpassed them all.” Why? Because they crafted the Tabernacle but were unable to put it together. What did they do? Each and every one took [the product of] his labor and they came to Moses. They said: ‘Here are the boards, here are the bars.’ When Moses saw them, the Divine Presence immediately rested upon him and he erected it. Do not say that Moses set it up; rather, miracles were performed regarding the Tabernacle and it stood on its own, as it is stated: “The Tabernacle was erected” (Exodus 40:17).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The verse states that the Tabernacle was erected rather than stating that people erected it, implying that it stood on its own. </i> If you are astonished about this, note that when Solomon built the Temple, it was built on its own. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: Everything assisted him when he built the House of God, [including] the angels<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Translation based on <i>Matnot Kehuna</i>. </i> and the spirits. From where is it derived? As it is written: “The House, in its construction, was built of whole stones that were transported; hammers, the axe, or any iron tools were not heard in the House in its construction” (I Kings 6:7). It was built on its own. Therefore, it was built with miraculous acts.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The reflexive Hebrew term <i>behibanoto</i>, translated as “in its construction,” can also be translated “as it built itself.” </i> Likewise, when the Tabernacle was erected, it was established with miraculous acts. That is, “they brought the Tabernacle.”
Another matter, “they brought the Tabernacle” – that is what is written: “Emerge, daughters of Zion, and look at King Solomon, with the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, and on the day of the rejoicing of his heart” (Song of Songs 3:11). When was this verse stated? On the day that the Tabernacle was set up, when there was great celebration in Israel because the Holy One blessed be He rested amongst them. “Daughters of Zion [<i>tziyon</i>]” – the children who are conspicuously [<i>hametzuyanim</i>] Mine, as acknowledged by the idolaters.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Jewish children, who are conspicuous in their manner of dress, including ritual fringes, in their hairstyle, and in their manner of behavior (<i>Matnot Kehuna</i>; <i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> Just as a signpost is pointed at with a finger, so, too, Israel is pointed at with a finger.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Just as a signpost is conspicuous and easily identified, so are Jews. </i> That is, “the daughters of Zion.” “[Look] at King Solomon [Shlomo],” at the King of Whom [it may be said] that peace [<i>hashalom</i>] is His; that is the King of kings the Holy One blessed be He. “With the crown with which his mother crowned him,” this is the Tabernacle. Why did he call it a crown? Because just as a crown is beautifully designed, so, too, the Tabernacle was beautifully designed, as it is stated: “And the embroiderer in sky blue, purple, and scarlet wool, and in linen, and of the weaver, performers of all craftsmanship and devisers of designs” (Exodus 35:35). That is, “with the crown with which his mother crowned him.” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: I reviewed the entire Bible and I did not find that Batsheva crafted a crown for Solomon.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore, the verse is not to be taken literally but rather as an allusion to the Tabernacle. </i> <br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai asked Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Yosei: ‘Did you, perhaps, hear from your father what is meant by [the phrase]: “With the crown with which his mother crowned him”?’ He said to him: ‘Yes; it is analogous to a king who had an only daughter and he loved her exceedingly. He called her: My daughter. He did not cease increasing his love for her until he called her: My sister, and until he called her: My mother.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A daughter is subservient to her father; a sister is equal to her brother, whereas a mother is owed honor and respect from her child as a matter of course and of law. Thus, each title reflects ever greater levels of love and dedication (<i>Etz Yosef</i>). </i> So, initially, the Holy One blessed be He called Israel a daughter, as it is stated: “Listen, daughter, and take note; incline your ear. Forget your people and your father’s house” (Psalms 45:11). He did not cease increasing His love for them until he called them: My sister, as it is stated: “Open for me, my sister, my love, my faultless dove, for my head is filled with dew, my locks, with drops of night” (Song of Songs 5:2). He did not cease increasing His love for them until he called them: My mother, as it is stated: “Pay attention to Me, My people, and listen to Me, My nation [<i>uleumi</i>]; for Torah will emerge from Me and My judgment I will lay down as a light for peoples”’ (Isaiah 51:4).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Uleumi </i>is expounded as though it were written <i>ule’imi</i>, to My mother.</i> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai stood and kissed him on the head. <br>“On the day of his wedding,” at Sinai; “and on the day of the rejoicing of his heart,” in Jerusalem. Alternatively, “on the day of his wedding,” at the sea; “and on the day of the rejoicing of his heart,” in the Tent of Meeting. Alternatively, “on the day of his wedding,” in the Tabernacle; “and on the day of the rejoicing of his heart,” in the Temple. Likewise, David said: “Beautiful in its view, joy of the entire world, is Mount Zion, the northern summit, the city of the great King.” (Psalms 48:3). <br>“Beautiful in its view, joy of the entire world.” Rabbi Yonatan ben Elazar said: There was an incident involving a certain merchant who went to Jerusalem to sell his merchandise. He went and sat there but did not sell [anything]. He said: ‘Is this [the city] of which they say it is the “joy of the entire world”?’ A short time later he sold all his merchandise. He said: “Beautiful in its view, joy of the entire world.” <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There was a dome of accounting outside of Jerusalem, and anyone who sought to take an accounting would go and take an accounting there,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Anyone who wanted to take an accounting of his expenditures or business activity could stop under this dome and make his calculations. </i> so that he would not take an accounting in Jerusalem and be distressed,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">He might be upset if his business activity was not as successful as he had hoped. </i> for it is called “joy of the entire world.” Why is it the object of all this praise? Because it is “the city of the great King.” But when it was destroyed: “All joy is negated [<i>arva</i>], gladness of the land is exiled” (Isaiah 24:11). What is <i>arva</i>? It grew dark, just as it says: “It was evening [<i>erev</i>] and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). In this world, “the joy of the entire world” is suspended. But when the Holy One blessed be He will rebuild Jerusalem, He will restore all the joy to its midst, as it is stated: “For the Lord will comfort Zion; He will comfort all its ruins; He will render its wilderness like Eden and its desert like a garden of the Lord. Gladness and joy will be found in it, thanksgiving and the sound of music” (Isaiah 51:3).
