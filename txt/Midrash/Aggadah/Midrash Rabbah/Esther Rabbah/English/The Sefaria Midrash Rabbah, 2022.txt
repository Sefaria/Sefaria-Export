Petichta

<b>“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh; that Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (Esther 1:1).</b><br>Rav began: “Your life will be suspended before you, and you will fear night and day, and you will not be assured of your life” (Deuteronomy 28:66). The Rabbis and Rabbi Berekhya; the Rabbis said: “Your life will be suspended before you,” that is one who purchases wheat for a year. “And you will fear night and day,” that is one who purchases wheat for himself from the retailer. “And you will not be assured of your life,” that is one who purchases for himself from the baker. <br>Rabbi Berekhya said: “Your life will be suspended before you,” that is one who purchases wheat for himself for three years. “And you will fear night and day,” that is one who purchases wheat for himself for one year. “And you will not be assured of your life,” that is one who purchases wheat for himself from the retailer. <br>The Rabbis objected to Rabbi Berekhya: What of the one who purchases from the baker? He said to them: The Torah did not speak of the dead. <br>Alternatively, “your life will be suspended before you,” that is one who is placed in the prisons of Caesarea. “And you will fear night and day,” that is one who is taken to judgment. “And you will not be assured of your life,” that is one who is taken out to be hanged. <br>Rav interpreted the verse as relating to Haman:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Specifically, relating to the effect of Haman’s decree on Israel.</i> “Your life will be suspended before you,”  – on the day following the removal of the ring.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Aḥashverosh removed his ring and gave it to Haman when he authorized him to do as he saw fit to the Jews (Esther 3:10-11).</i> “And you will fear night and day” – when the letters were dispatched.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Haman sent written orders to all the provinces for the people to prepare themselves to kill the Jews (Esther 3:13-15).</i> “And you will not be assured of your life” – “to be ready for that day” (Esther 3:14).
<b>“In the morning you will say: Would that it were evening, and in the evening you will say: Would that it were morning – from your heart’s fear that you experience and your eyes’ sight that you see” (Deuteronomy 28:67).</b><br>“In the morning you will say: Would that it were evening” – in the morning of Babylonia you will say: ‘Would that it were its evening.’ In the morning of Media, you will say: ‘Would that it were its evening.’ In the morning of Greece, you will say: ‘Would that it were its evening.’ In the morning of Edom, you will say: ‘Would that it were its evening.’<br>Alternatively, “in the morning you will say: Would that it were evening,” in the morning of Babylonia you will say: Would that it were the evening of Media. In the morning of Media, you will say: Would that it were the evening of Greece. In the morning of Greece, you will say: Would that it were the evening of Edom. Why? “From your heart’s fear that you experience and your eyes’ sight that you see” (Deuteronomy 28:67).
<b>“The Lord will return you to Egypt in ships [<i>baoniyyot</i>], by the route of which I said to you: You will never see it again; and you will offer yourselves for sale there to your enemies, as slaves and as maidservants, and there will be no buyer” (Deuteronomy 28:68).</b><br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “In ships” [<i>baoniyyot</i>] – in poverty [<i>baaniyyut</i>]<i> </i>of good deeds. Why to Egypt? Because a slave experiences humiliation and mistreatment when he returns to his original master. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: In three places, the Holy One blessed be He cautions Israel not to return to Egypt. The first, as it is stated: “For as you saw Egypt [today, you shall not see them ever again]” (Exodus 14:13). The second, it is written: “The Lord said to you: You shall not return again on that way anymore” (Deuteronomy 17:16). This is the third, as it is written: “The Lord will return you to Egypt in ships” (Deuteronomy 28:68).<br>They [Israel] contravened all three of them and were punished for all three of them. The first, during the reign of Sanḥeriv, as it is stated: “Woe! Those who descend to Egypt for aid” (Isaiah 31:1), and what is written thereafter: “Egypt is man, not god […and all of them will perish together]” (Isaiah 31:3). Second, during the days of Yoḥanan ben Kare’aḥ, as it is stated: “It shall be that the sword which you fear [will overtake you there in the land of Egypt]” (Jeremiah 42:16). The third, during the reign of Trajan, may his bones be crushed: His wife gave birth on the Ninth of Av when all Israel was mourning. The baby died on Hanukkah. Israel said: Shall we light [Hanukkah lamps], or not light? They said: We shall light, and anything that he seeks to inflict upon us, let him inflict. They lit. They went and slandered them to Trajan’s wife: Those Jews,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The reference is possibly to the Jews of Egypt who participated in the Kitos War (115-117), a rebellion against the Romans during Trajan’s reign.</i> when you gave birth, they were mourning, when the baby died, they lit lamps. She sent a missive to her husband: Before you conquer the barbarians, come and conquer these Jews who have rebelled against you. He boarded the ship and expected to arrive in ten days, and the wind brought him in five days. He arrived and found them engaged in this verse: “The Lord will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle will swoop” (Deuteronomy 28:49). He said to them: I am the eagle, as I expected to arrive in ten days and the wind brought me in five days. His legions surrounded them and killed them.<br>“And there is no buyer [<i>koneh</i>]” (Deuteronomy 28:68). Why is there no buyer? Rav said: It is because you did not impart the words of the covenant, as there is no one among you who is a buyer [<i>koneh</i>] of [i.e., one who learns] the five books of the Torah, the numerical value of <i>koneh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>koneh </i>– <i>kof</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>heh</i> – can be read as <i>koneh heh</i>, i.e. ‘buyer of <i>heh</i>.’ The numerical equivalent of <i>heh</i> is five.</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Because I went around to all the nations of the world and there was no one acquiring [no buyer of] the words of the Torah like you [Israel] did. Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzhak said: You have acquisition of [members of] the nations of the world [i.e. the ability to buy them as slaves], as it is stated: “Also from the children of the resident aliens who reside with you, from them you shall acquire” (Leviticus 25:45); but the nations have no acquisition of you. Why do you have acquisition of the nations of the world? It is because you imparted: “These are the words of the covenant” (Deuteronomy 28:69). Why don’t the nations of the world have acquisition in you? It is because they did not acquire: “These are the words of the covenant.”<br>Rabbi Yonatan said: You have patrons, and what are they? They are the words of the covenant. Rabbi Yuda said: You are property of the crown; Isn’t the life of one who takes a slave from the property of the crown forfeit? And so Aḥashverosh said to his wife: “Behold, I gave the house of Haman to Esther [and they hanged him on the gibbet]” (Esther 8:7), and Rabbi Yuda bar Rabbi Simon said: It is because he extended his hand to harm the property of the crown, so it befell him.<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: There was an incident in Protzefya involving a certain woman who would redeem captives. One captive woman came, and she redeemed her. A second, and she redeemed her. When her means failed her and she was unable to redeem any more, soldiers immediately surrounded her and killed her. Why did they go to that extreme? In order to motivate future captors.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The local soldiers killed her in order to motivate future captors to kill their prisoners rather than hold them for ransom.</i> <br>Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yitzḥak. Rabbi Levi said: Who acquires a friend, and the next day he is executed? Who acquires a wife, and the next day she is executed? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: You will not be acquired as slaves and maidservants, but you will be acquired to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be eliminated, as Esther said to Aḥashverosh: “For we have been sold, my people and I, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be eliminated; had we been sold as slaves and as maidservants, I would have been silent” (Esther 7:4). And so Moses wrote about us in the Torah: “And you will sell yourselves there to your enemies as slaves and as maidservants, and there will be no buyer” (Deuteronomy 28:68); perhaps to be destroyed, to  be killed, and to be eliminated? When everyone saw, they began screaming: ‘Woe!’ “It was [<i>vayhi</i>],” woe [<i>vai</i>] for what transpired during the reign of Aḥashverosh.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The first verse of Esther begins <i>Va-yhi bi-mei Aḥashverosh</i>, “It was during the days of Aḥashverosh.”</i>
<b>“And despite this, even when they are in the land of their enemies, I have not spurned them and have not rejected them, to destroy them, to violate My covenant with them, as I am the Lord their God” (Leviticus 26:44).</b><br>Shmuel began: “And despite this, even when they are in the land of their enemies, I have not spurned them and have not rejected them, to destroy them, to violate My covenant with them, as I am the Lord their God.” – “I have not spurned them,” in Babylonia; “and have not rejected them,” in Media; “to destroy them,” in Greece; “to violate My covenant with them,” in the evil kingdom;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Rome.</i> “as I am the Lord their God,” in the future. Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “I have not spurned them,” during the reign of Vespasian; “and have not rejected them,” during the reign of Trajan; “to destroy them,” in the days of Haman; “to violate My covenant with them,” in the days of the Romans; “as I am the Lord their God,” in the days of Gog and Magog.
<b>“As when a man fled from the lion and a bear attacked him; he came home and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him” (Amos 5:19).</b><br>Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon began: “As when a man fled from the lion and a bear attacked him; he came home and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him.” Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Aḥa in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: “As when a man fled from the lion,” that is Babylonia, according to: “The first was like a lion” (Daniel 7:4); “and a bear attacked him,” that is Media, according to: “And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a bear” (Daniel 7:5). <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <i>le dev</i> is written [“a second one, resembling a bear (<i>dov</i>)].”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> The words in the verse in Daniel 7:5 <i>domeh le-dov</i>, “resembling a bear,” could be vocalized <i>domeh le-dev</i>, meaning resembling a wolf, as <i>dev</i> can mean wolf in Aramaic.</i> This is the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “Therefore, a lion from the forest smote them” (Jeremiah 5:6), that is Babylonia; “a wolf of the deserts will plunder them” (Jeremiah 5:6), that is Media; “a leopard lies in wait near their cities” (Jeremiah 5:6), that is Greece; “everyone who emerges from them will be mauled” (Jeremiah 5:6), that is Edom; “he comes home” (Amos 5:19), that is Greece when the Temple stood; “and a snake bit him” (Amos 5:19), that is Edom, as it is stated: “Its sound will go forth like a snake” (Jeremiah 46:22).<br>Likewise, it says: “Open for me, my sister, my love, my dove, my faultless one,” (Song of Songs 5:2). “Open for me, my sister,” that is Babylonia; “my love,” that is Media; “my faultless one,” in Greece; “my dove,” in Edom, as throughout the days of Greece[’s hegemony] the Temple was standing and Israel was offering doves and pigeons on the altar.<br>Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina offered an interpretation [of “In my distress I called to the Lord and to my God I cried; from His Sanctuary He heard my voice, and my cry before Him came into His ears” (Psalms 18:7)]: It is written: “In my distress I called to the Lord,” in Babylonia; “and to my God I cried,” in Media; from His Sanctuary He heard my voice,” in Greece, as Rabbi Huna himself said: “My dove,” in Greece, as throughout the days of Greece, the Temple was standing and Israel was offering there doves and pigeons on the altar. That is: “from His Sanctuary He heard my voice and my cry before Him came into His ears,” in the kingdom of Edom.<br>Another matter: “ As when a man fled from the lion,” that is Nebuchadnezzar; “and a bear attacked him,” that is Belshatzar; “he came home and leaned his hand on the wall, and a snake bit him,” that is Haman, who would crush the people like a snake. That is as it is written: “Reḥum the commander and Shimshai the scribe” (Ezra 4:8), that is the son of Haman; “wrote a letter…to Artaxerxes the king, as follows” (ibid.). And what was written in it? “Now issue a decree to cease, and that this city not be rebuilt ….” (Ezra 4:21), [“they will no longer pay] <i>minda</i>” (Ezra 4:13), that is land tax; “<i>belo</i>” (ibid.), that is the poll tax; and “<i>halakh</i>” (ibid.), that is the king’s service; “and the revenue of the kings will be harmed” (ibid.). Rav Huna and Rabbi Pinḥas said: Even things with which the kingdom entertains itself, e.g., theaters and circuses, this people harms. When he sent it, it was received by the king, and he canceled work on the Temple. When they saw that, everyone began screaming: 'Woe [<i>vai</i>];' “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “With the rise of the righteous the people rejoice, and with the rule of the wicked the people sigh.” (Proverbs 29:2). When the righteous achieve prominence, there is joy and happiness in the world; there is joy [<i>va</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The word king [<i>melekh</i>] is preceded with the prefix <i>vav</i> <i>heh</i>. <i>Va </i>is an expression of joy.</i> <i> </i>in the world: “And the King [<i>vehamelekh</i>] David” (II Samuel 3:31), <i>va  </i>that David reigned; “and the King [<i>vehamelekh</i>]  Solomon” (I Kings 2:45)<i> va  </i>that Solomon reigned; “and the King [<i>vehamelekh</i>] Asa” (I Kings 15:22), <i>va  </i>that Asa reigned. This is regarding kings of Israel; from where [do we know] regarding kings of the nations of the world? As it is stated: “And Cyrus the King [<i>vehamelekh</i>]” (Ezra 1:4), <i>va </i>that Cyrus reigned.<br>But when the wicked achieve prominence, woe [<i>vai</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The word reign [<i>yimlokh</i>] is preceded with the prefix <i>vav</i> <i>yod</i>. <i>Vai</i> is an expression of woe.</i> sighing, and enflamed wrath are in the world. “Ahab son of Omri reigned [<i>vayimlokh</i>] over Israel” (I Kings 16:29), <i>vai</i> that Ahab son of Omri reigned. “Hoshe’a son of Ela…reigned [<i>vayimlokh</i>]” (II Kings 15:30), <i>vai</i> that Hoshe’a son of Ela reigned. “Zedekiah son of Yoshiyahu reigned [<i>vayimlokh</i>]” (Jeremiah 37:1), <i>vai</i> that Zedekiah son of Josiah reigned. Regarding kings of the nations of the world, it is as it is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1), <i>vai</i> that Aḥashverosh reigned.
Rabbi Levi began: “But if you will not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, those who you leave will be like  thorns in your eyes, and like stones in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land you inhabit” (Numbers 33:55). [This verse] refers to Saul. When Samuel said to him: “Now go and smite Amalek” (I Samuel 15:3), he said to him: You went innocent and you returned guilty and spared him, as it is stated: “Saul and the people spared Agag” (I Samuel 15:9). A scion will remain from him, who will perform harsh actions against you; “will be like thorns in your eyes, and like stones in your sides.” And who is that? It is Haman, who said: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). When everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).
Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ada began: [“The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace, and the lips of a fool will swallow him” (Ecclesiastes 10:12).] “The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace” – that is Cyrus, as it is stated: “So said Cyrus king of Persia: The Lord, God of the heavens, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and He has commanded me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah” (Ezra 1:2). “And the lips of a fool will swallow him” – as he (Cyrus) said: “He is the God who is in Jerusalem”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The implication being that He is only the god of Jerusalem, which demonstrates Cyrus’ foolishness.</i> (Ezra 1:3).<br>“The beginning of the words from his mouth is foolishness and the result from his mouth is evil debauchery” (Ecclesiastes 10:13). What is the foolishness? “Any of you from all His people, may his God be with him…”<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">“His God,” implying that other nations have their own gods.</i> (Ezra 1:3). “The result from his mouth is evil debauchery,” as he decreed, saying: Whoever crossed the Euphrates, crossed; and whoever has not crossed, shall not cross. <br>Another matter: “The beginning of the words...” that is Aḥashverosh, as it is stated: “In the reign of Aḥashverosh, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote a libel against the residents of Judah and Jerusalem.” (Ezra 4:6). “The result from his mouth is evil debauchery,” as he went up and cancelled the work on the Temple. When everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).
Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon began: “From a hypocritical person’s rule; from snares of the people” (Job 34:30). Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish: Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When the king is a hypocrite and rules the people, “from snares [<i>mimokeshei</i>] of the people,” it is due to the stubbornness [<i>kashyuteihen</i>] and the liabilities of the people who do not perform the will of the Creator of the world. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It is preferable for people to grow themselves wings and fly in the air rather than for them to be turned over and subjugated to a hypocritical king. <br>Alternatively, “from a hypocritical person’s rule,” that is Aḥashverosh, who was hypocritical, who killed his wife because of his friend, and a different time killed his friend because of his wife. <br>Abba Oriyan of Sidon said five things in the name of Rabban Gamliel: <br>When lying judges increase, lying witnesses increase. <br>When informants increase, the property of the people is plundered. <br>When brazenness increases, glory, majesty, and honor are taken from the people.<br>When the actions of beloved children anger their Father in Heaven, He sets over them a hypocritical king who exacts retribution from them.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Abba Oriyan is said to list five things he heard from Rabban Gamliel, and this list contains only four. In <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, Esther, 1,044, the following is inserted here: “When the younger says to the elder: I am greater than you, the lives of people are truncated.”</i> <br>And who is this? It is Aḥashverosh. When everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming; ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).
Rabbi Berekhya began: “Who acted and accomplished it? He who proclaimed the generations from the beginning; I, the Lord was first and with the last, I am He” (Isaiah 41:4). From the beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, instituted for each and every person what is appropriate for him: Adam, head of the created; Cain, head of the killers; Abel, head of the killed; Noah, head of the survivors; Abraham, head of the circumcised; Isaac, head of the bound; Jacob, head of the wholehearted; Judah, head of the tribes; Joseph, head of the pious; Aaron, head of the priests; Moses, head of the prophets; Joshua, head of the conquerors; Otniel, head of the allocators;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">He completed the allocation of the tribal portions that Joshua did not allocate in his lifetime.</i> Samuel, of the anointers; Saul, of the anointed; David, of the musicians; Solomon, head of the builders; Nebuchadnezzar, head of the destroyers; Aḥashverosh, head of the sellers; Haman, head of the buyers; when everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’  “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1).
Rabbi Tanḥuma, Rabbi Berekhya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great interpreted in the name of Rabbi Elazar: This midrash came up with us from the Exile. Everyplace that <i>vayhi</i> is stated, it means nothing but trouble. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman interpreted in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: This midrash came into our possession. Everyplace that <i>vayhi bimei</i> is stated, it means nothing but trouble. <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: They are five:<br>“It was during the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Amrafel king of Shinar, Ariokh, king of Elasar, Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goyim” (Genesis 14:1). What was the trouble there? “They waged war with Bera, king of Sodom…” (Genesis 14:2). [This is analogous] to the beloved of a king who resided in a province and, for his sake, the king attended to that province. When barbarians came and afflicted him [the beloved of the king], they [the other residents of the province] said: ‘Woe unto us that the king is not attending to the province the way that he once did.’ So too, Abraham our patriarch, the beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He, “all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:4). For his sake, the Holy One blessed be He attended to His entire world. That is what is written: “They returned and came to Ein Mishpat, which is Kadesh” (Genesis 14:7). They sought to afflict only the eye of the world [Abraham]. They sought to blind the eye that acts upon the attribute of justice in the world. <sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"> This probably means that Abraham is responsible for the suppression of the attribute of justice, the result of which is that God rules the world through the attribute of mercy.</i> “Which is [<i>hi</i>] Kadesh” – Rabbi Aḥa said: <i>Hu </i>[i.e. he rather than she] is written. He [Abraham] sanctified [<i>kiddesh</i>] the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and he went into the fiery furnace. When everyone saw that all the kings came to afflict him, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the reign of Amrafel.”<br>“It was during the days [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] when the judges judged; there was a famine in the land and a man from Bethlehem in Judah went to stay in the field of Moab, he, his wife, and his two sons” (Ruth 1:1). What was the trouble there? “There was a famine in the land.” [This is comparable] to a province that owed a tax to the king, and the king sent a tax collector to collect it. What did the residents of the province do? They suspended him [on a pole] and struck him and extracted it [the money] from him. They said: Woe unto us when the king becomes aware of these matters; we did to the emissary of the king what he sought to do to us. So too, when one of the people of Israel would perform inappropriate actions, they would take him to the judge, and what the judge sought to do to the defendant, the defendant would do to the judge. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: You humiliate your judges; by your lives, I will bring upon you a matter that you are unable to endure. What is that? It is famine, as it is stated: “It was during the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1).<br>“It was during the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Aḥaz son of Yotam, son of Uziyahu, king of Judah; Retzin, king of Aram and Pekaḥ, son of Remalyahu, king of Israel, went to war against Jerusalem, but he was unable to make war against it” (Isaiah 7:1). What was the trouble there? It was as it is written: “Aram from the east and the Philistines from the west” (Isaiah 9:11). [This is comparable] to a king who handed his son over to a tutor, and his tutor hated him. He said: If I kill him, I will be condemned to death by the king; instead, I will withhold his nurse from him, and he will die on his own. So too, Aḥaz said: If there are no kids, there are no goats, and if there are no goats there is no flock, and if there is no flock there is no shepherd, and if there is no shepherd, the world cannot exist. So Aḥaz thought and said: If there are no children, there are no adults, and if there are no adults there are no students, if there are no students there are no scholars, if there are no scholars there are no elders, if there are no elders there is no Torah, if there is no Torah there are no synagogues and study halls, if there are no synagogues and study halls, the Holy One, blessed be He, will not rest His Divine Presence in the world. What did he do? He arose and locked all the synagogues and study halls, so that no one would engage in Torah study. That is what is written: “Bind the testimony, seal the Torah in my disciples” (Isaiah 8:16). <br>Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: Why was he named Aḥaz? It is because he seized [<i>aḥaz</i>] the synagogues and study halls. Rabbi Yaakov bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Aḥa derived it from this verse, as it is written: “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for Him” (Isaiah 8:17). There was no time that was as grim for Israel as that time, as it is stated: “I will conceal My face on that day because of all the evil that they did…” (Deuteronomy 31:18). But from that moment I hoped for Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the verse quoted above “I will wait for the Lord, who conceals His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope for Him” (Isaiah 8:17).</i> as it is written: “As it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their descendants” (Deuteronomy 31:21). What did you [Aḥaz] accomplish? “Behold, I [Isaiah] and the children whom the Lord gave me are to become signs and wonders in Israel” (Isaiah 8:18). Were they his children? Surely, they were nothing but his students! Rather, from here [we learn] that a person’s student is called his son. Once everyone saw that he seized the synagogues and study halls, they began screaming: Woe [<i>vai</i>]: “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥaz.”<br>“It was during the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Yehoyakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month” (Jeremiah 1:3). What was the trouble there? “I saw the land, and behold, it is emptiness and disorder; the heavens, and their light is not” (Jeremiah 4:23). [This is comparable] to a king who sent letters from province to province and in each and every province that his letters reached, they would embrace and kiss them, standing on their feet, baring their heads and reading them with reverence, fear, quaking, and trembling. When they reached the king’s province, they read them, ripped them, and burned them. That is what is written: “It was, as Yehudi would read three columns or four,” (Jeremiah 36:23) – three or four verses. When they reached the fifth verse: “Its besiegers are ascendant” (Lamentations 1:5), immediately: “He would cut it with a scribe’s razor and cast it into the fire that was in the fireplace” (Jeremiah 36:23). Once everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Yehoyakim.”<br>“It was during the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Aḥashverosh; that Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (Esther 1:1). What was the trouble there? It was “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). [This is comparable] to a king who entered a vineyard and encountered three enemies: The first began picking unripe grapes, the second began trimming the clusters, and the third began uprooting vines. So too, wicked Pharaoh began picking unripe grapes; that is what is written: “Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying: Every son who is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22). <br>Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed, began trimming the clusters; that is what is written: “He exiled Yehoyakhin…and the artisans and the smiths, one thousand” (II Kings 24:14). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Yehuda said: One thousand artisans and one thousand smiths; the Rabbis said: One thousand artisans and smiths. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: These are the Torah scholars. Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: These are the notables. <br>Haman the wicked, may he be crushed and wiped out, began uprooting the vines; that is what is written: “To destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). He sought to undermine the foundation of Israel, he wanted to devastate the whole house [of Israel]. Once everyone saw that it was so, they began screaming: ‘Woe [<i>vai</i>];’ “it was [<i>vayhi</i>] during the days of Aḥashverosh.”<br>Shimon bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yonatan said: Everywhere that <i>vayhi </i>is stated it refers to trouble or to joy; if it is to trouble, it is unparalleled trouble, if it is to joy, it is unparalleled joy. Rabban Shmuel bar Naḥman came and suggested a different distinction: Everywhere that it says <i>vayhi </i>(it was), it refers to trouble, everywhere that it says <i>vehaya </i>(it will be), joy. <br>They objected: Is it not written: “God said: Let there be light, and there was [<i>vayhi</i>] light”? He said to them: Even that is not joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: By the light that was created on the first day, a person could look out and see from one end of the world to the other end. When the Holy One, blessed be He, perceived that the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion (after the Tower of Babel) were destined to sin before Him, He arose and concealed it from them. That is what is written: “From the wicked was withheld their light” (Job 38:15). Where did He conceal it? In the Garden of Eden; that is what is written: “Light is sown for the righteous and joy for the upright” (Psalms 97:11). <br>They objected: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created on the first day is destined to wither; that is what is written: “As the heavens will be eroded like smoke and the earth will be tattered like a garment” (Isaiah 51:6).<br>They objected: It is written: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening and it was morning, a second day,” “…a third day,” through the sixth day. He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as everything that was created during the six days of Creation requires action, as they were not completely made, e.g. wheat requires grinding, and mustard and lupines require sweetening.<br>They objected: “The Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as that resulted in that bear<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Potifar’s wife.</i> confronting him. <br>They objected: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day, Moses summoned Aaron and his sons” (Leviticus 9:1). He said to them: That, too, is not good, as on that day, Nadav and Avihu died and all of Israel lamented them, as it is stated: “Your brethren, the entire house of Israel, will lament the burning” (Leviticus 10:6).<br>They objected: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] on the day that Moses completed assembling the Tabernacle” (Numbers 7:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it was put away when the eternal Temple was built.<br>They objected: “The Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joshua” (Joshua 6:27). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day Ya’ir, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin, was killed; that is what is written: “The men of Ai smote them, about thirty-six men” (Joshua 7:5). Thirty-six men is not written, but rather “like thirty-six;”<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"> The verse says: “The men of the Ai killed about thirty-six [<i>ki-shloshim ve-shisha</i>] men…” The prepositional ‘<i>ki-</i>’ can designate approximation, “about thirty-six” or comparison, “like thirty-six.”</i> that is Ya’ir, who was equivalent to the majority of Sanhedrin [of 70 or 71 members]. What is written there? “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6).<br>They objected: “David was [<i>vayhi</i>] successful in all his ways” (I Samuel 18:14). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as it resulted in what is written: Saul felt enmity to David” (I Samuel 18:9).<br>They objected: “It was [<i>vayhi</i>] when David dwelled in his house” (I Chronicles 17:1). He said to them: That, too, is not joy, as on that day, Natan the prophet came and said to him: “It will not be you who builds Me the House” (I Chronicles 17:4).<br>They said to him: We said ours, now you say yours. He said to them, it is written: “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day, the mountains will drip with nectar and the hills will flow with milk” (Joel 4:18). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day that spring water will emerge from Jerusalem” (Zechariah 14:8). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day, each man shall keep a calf of the herd and two sheep alive, and from the abundance of milk produced, he will eat butter, for everyone who remains in the midst of the land will eat butter and honey” (Isaiah 7:21-22). “The remnant of Jacob will be [<i>vehaya</i>] among the nations, in the midst of many peoples like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he passes, tramples and mauls, and there is no deliverer” (Micah 5:7). “It will be [<i>vehaya</i>] on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, and the lost in the land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt will come and bow down to the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 27:13). “He will be [<i>vehaya</i>] like a tree planted near streams of water which yields fruit in season; its leaves shall not wither, and whatever he does will prosper” (Psalms 1:3). <br>They objected to him: “And it was [<i>vehaya</i>] when Jerusalem was captured” (Jeremiah 38:28). He said to them: Even that is not trouble but joy, as on that day, Menaḥem<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The Messiah.</i> was born and Israel made penance for its sins, as Rav and Shmuel say: Israel made great penance at the moment that the Temple was destroyed. That is what is written: “Your sin is completed, daughter of Zion” (Lamentations 4:22).
Rav and Shmuel: Rav said: Everything that the Holy One blessed be He said, He said about him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Aḥashverosh, who would be the king during whose reign the punishment would be completed.</i> That is what is written: “I will eliminate from Babylonia name and remnant, child and grandchild” (Isaiah 14:22). “Name,” that is Nebuchadnezzar; “and remnant,” that is Evil Merodakh; “child,” that is Belshatzar; “and grandchild,” that is Vashti. Alternatively, “name,” that is their script; “and remnant,” that is their language; “child and grandchild,” that is child and grandchild.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"> Evil Merodakh and Belshatzar.</i><br>And Shmuel said: Everything that the Holy One blessed be He said, He said about him. That is what is written: “I will place My throne in Elam, and I will eliminate king and princes from there, says the Lord” (Jeremiah 49:38). “King,” that is Vashti, “and princes,” these are the seven princes of Media and Persia.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: “The Lord will lead you, and your king whom you have set over you, to a nation unknown to you or your fathers, and you will serve there other gods, of wood and stone” (Deuteronomy 28:36).

Chapter 1

<b>“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh; that [<i>hu</i>] Aḥashverosh; that [<i>hu</i>] Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces”  (Esther 1:1).</b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">What follows is a series of wordplays on the name Aḥashverosh.</i><br>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Who blackened [<i>hishḥir</i>] the faces of Israel like the bottom of a pot. Rabbi Berekhya said: Who weakened [<i>hikḥish</i>] the head of Israel with fasting and abstinence. Rabbi Levi said: Who gave them gall and wormwood to drink [<i>hishka</i>]. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: Who sought to undermine the foundation of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, to undermine the egg of Israel. The wordplay with the name Aḥashverosh is obscure in this case. Perhaps it involves the word הוריש, meaning to dispossess or destroy.</i> Rabbi Taḥlifa bar bar Ḥana said: Who was the brother [<i>aḥ</i>] of a leader [<i>rosh</i>], the brother of Nebuchadnezzar. Was he his brother? Was not this one a Chaldean and that one a Median? Rather, this one canceled the construction of the Temple, and that one destroyed it; therefore, Scripture equated them. That is what is written: “Even one who is lax in his work is brother to a master of destruction.” (Proverbs 18:9). “Even one who is lax in his work,” that is Aḥashverosh, who canceled the construction of the Temple. “Is brother to a master of destruction,” that is Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed the Temple.<br>Alternatively, “Aḥashverosh” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: One said: “Aḥashverosh,” who killed his wife [Vashti] because of his beloved one [Haman]; “that Aḥashverosh,” who killed his beloved one [Haman] because of his wife [Esther]. Rabbi Neḥemya said: “Aḥashverosh,” who canceled the construction of the Temple; “that Aḥashverosh,” who decreed that it should be rebuilt. Was it him who decreed? Was it not Cyrus who decreed? Rather, it is written: “During the first year of King Cyrus” (Ezra 6:3). During that year, all his advisers came to him; they said to him: ‘Your father decreed about it that it shall not be rebuilt, and you decree about it that it shall be rebuilt? Does a king abrogate the decrees of another king?’ He said to them: ‘Bring me the copies of the decrees.’ Immediately, they brought them to him. That is what is written: “A scroll was found in Aḥmeta in the capital” (Ezra 6:2). What was written in it? “Now, issue a decree to cancel” (Ezra 4:21). He said to them: ‘Is ‘forever’ written? It is only written: “Until a decree from me will be issued.” Who can say to me that were my father alive, he would not have built it?’ Therefore, he is included with the prophets; that is what is written: “The elders of the Jews built and prospered [in accordance with the prophecy of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Ido, and built and finished, by the decree of the God of Israel, and by the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaḥshasta<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash identifies Artaḥshasta king of Persia as Aḥashverosh.</i> king of Persia]” (Ezra 6:14).
“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh; that [<i>hu</i>] Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (Esther 1:1). <i>Hu</i> [appears] five [times] for evil, and five for good. Five for evil: “He [<i>hu</i>] was a mighty hunter”<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Nimrod.</i> (Genesis 10:9); “he is [<i>hu</i>] Esau, father of Edom” (Genesis 36:43); “this is [<i>hu</i>] Datan and Aviram” (Numbers 26:9); “he is [<i>hu</i>] King Aḥaz” (II Chronicles 28:22); “that [<i>hu</i>] Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1). Five for good: “Abram, he is [<i>hu</i>] Abraham” (I Chronicles 1:27); “that [<i>hu</i>] Aaron and Moses…that [<i>hu</i>] Moses and Aaron” (Exodus 6:26–27); “David was [<i>hu</i>] the youngest” (I Samuel 17:14); “he [<i>hu</i>], Yeḥizhiyahu” (II Chronicles 32:30); “he [<i>hu</i>], Ezra, came up from Babylon” (Ezra 7:6). Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of the Rabbis from there: We have one that is better than all of them: “He is [<i>hu</i>] the Lord our God; His judgments are throughout the land” (Psalms 105:7), whose attribute of mercy is forever.
“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh…” Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis, Rabbi Levi said: Aḥashverosh is Artaḥshasta. The Rabbis say: [He was called] Aḥashverosh, since anyone who remembers him, his head hurts [<i>ḥoshesh et rosho</i>]. Why did Scripture call him Artaḥshasta? It is because he would anger [<i>martiaḥ</i>] and exhaust<i> </i>[<i>vetash</i>] [others]. Aḥashverosh – Rabbi Yitzḥak and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “Aḥashverosh” – as all the troubles came during his days, as it is stated: “there was great mourning among the Jews” (Esther 4:3). “That is Aḥashverosh” – as all the good came during his days, as it is stated: “Joy and gladness for the Jews, a banquet and a holiday” (Esther 8:17). The Rabbis say: “Aḥashverosh” – before Esther came before him; “that is Aḥashverosh” – after Esther came before him, he would no longer copulate with menstruants.
“It was during the days of Aḥashverosh; that [<i>hu</i>] Aḥashverosh who reigned from India to Kush, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces.”  “Who reigned” – but had not yet reigned.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This is obscure. Perhaps it means that he had not been an heir to the throne.</i> “From India [<i>Hodu</i>] to Kush” – but isn’t it a short distance from <i>Hodu</i> to <i>Kush</i>?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It is unclear what places the Rabbis identified as <i>Hodu</i> and <i>Kush</i>. The Babylonian Talmud (<i>Megila</i> 11a) records two opinions: one that they are at opposite ends of the earth (consistent with their identification with India and Ethiopia) and the other that they were adjacent to one another, as is implied here.</i> Rather, just as he reigned from <i>Hodu</i> to <i>Kush</i>, so he reigned over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces. On a similar note: “For he [Solomon] ruled over the entire region beyond the river, from Tifsaḥ to Gaza” (I Kings 5:4), but isn’t it a short distance from Tifsaḥ to Gaza? Rather, just as he reigned from Tifsaḥ to Gaza, so he reigned from one end of the world to the other end. <br>Similarly, “From your palace to Jerusalem, kings bring gifts to You”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The literal reading of the verse is “From Your Temple above Jerusalem, to You will kings bring gifts.” The midrash is reading the verse to mean that the kings will bring gifts from the king’s palace to the Temple in Jerusalem.</i> (Psalms 68:30) –  is it not but a short distance from your palace [i.e. the king’s palace] to [the Temple in] Jerusalem? Rather, just as it is commonplace that the sacrificial offerings [go] from the palace to [the Temple in] Jerusalem, so too, processions with gifts are destined to be commonplace for the messianic king. That is what is written: “All kings will prostrate themselves before him” (Psalms 72:11). Rabbi Kohen, brother of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said: Just as the Divine Presence is found between the Temple and Jerusalem, so will the Divine Presence fill the world from one end to the other end. That is what is written: “May the whole earth be filled with His glory, amen and amen” (Psalms 72:19).
“…who reigned from India to Kush, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces.” Rabbi Eliezer in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: Are there not two hundred and fifty-two provinces in the world? David ruled over them all; that is what is written: “David’s renown went out to all the lands” (I Chronicles 14:17). Solomon ruled over them all; that is what is written: “Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms...” (I Kings 5:1). Aḥav ruled over them all; that is what is written: “As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom [to where my lord did not send to seek you]” (I Kings 18:10). Does a person take an oath about a place that he does not rule? Additionally, from here: “He counted the young princes of the dominions, and they were two hundred and thirty-two…” (I Kings 20:15). Where were the rest?<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Earlier it was said that there were two hundred and fifty-two provinces, and here there are representatives of only two hundred and thirty-two dominions.</i> Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis: Rabbi Levi said: They ceased to exist in the famine during the days of Eliyahu. The Rabbis said that Ben Haddad came and took them. That is what is written: “Ben Haddad king of Aram gathered his entire army, and thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots; he went and besieged Samaria, and waged war against it” (I Kings 20:1). We need twenty, and you say thirty-two? Rather, there were provinces that were intractable, and he would take two [young princes] from them as hostages in his charge.<br>Rabbi Berekhya and the Rabbis [related to the verse: “He pierced my kidneys with the contents of his quiver [<i>benei ashpato</i>]” (Lamentations 3:13)].  Rabbi Berekhya said: These were the captives [<i>benei ukaifi</i>] and the hostages [<i>benei emuryai</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">These were the “contents of his quiver,” with which God pierced Israel’s kidneys.</i> The Rabbis said: <i>Benei ukaifi</i> – as they were subjugated with manacles [<i>arkof</i>], and <i>benei emuryai</i> – as they were substitutes [<i>temurot</i>] for their fathers. And so it says: “And the hostages [<i>benei hataaruvot</i>]” (II Kings 14:14), they were guarantees [<i>me’uravot</i>] for their fathers.<br>Nebuchadnezzar ruled over them all; that is what is written: “Everywhere the sons of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens dwell, [He has given into your hand and set your rule over them all]” (Daniel 2:38). Cyrus ruled over them all; that is what is written: “The Lord…has given me all the kingdoms of the earth” (Ezra 1:2). Darius ruled over them all; that is what is written: “Then King Darius wrote to all the peoples, [the nations, and the [speakers of different] languages that reside in the entire earth]” (Daniel 6:26). Aḥashverosh ruled over half of them. Why over half of them? Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Aḥa and the Rabbis, Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: You divided my kingdom, as you said: “He is the God, who is in Jerusalem” (Ezra 1:3); by your life, I am going to divide your kingdom. The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: You split My house, as you said: “Its height shall be sixty cubits<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The height of the Sanctuary in Solomon’s Temple was one hundred and twenty cubits.</i> and its width sixty cubits” (Ezra 6:3); by your life, I am going to split your kingdom. <br>Let it say one hundred and twenty-six, for what reason does the verse state “one hundred and twenty-seven provinces”? Rather, this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: You added one ascent [<i>aliya</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Aliya</i> means both second floor and ascent.</i> to My house from your own, as you said: “Any among you from His entire people, may his God be with him, and he may ascend” (Ezra 1:3); I, too, will provide you with an additional ascent from my own, so he added one province to the tally; that is what is written: “One hundred and twenty-seven provinces.”
Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It is written: “The hair of His head like pure wool” (Daniel 7:9); that He has no debt to any creature. Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Ayevu: It is written: “I have trodden a winepress alone and from the peoples there was no man with Me...” (Isaiah 63:3). Does the Holy One blessed be He need the help of the nations, that He said: “And from the peoples there was no man with Me?” Rather, this is what the Holy One blessed be He said: When I examine the ledgers of the nations of the world and no merit will be found for them before Me, at that moment, “I trod on them in My wrath and I trampled them in My fury” (Isaiah 63:3). <br>Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Ḥilkiyya said in the name of Rabbi Simon: It is written: “It shall be on that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations [that come against Jerusalem]” (Zechariah 12:9). Will seek? Is there anyone preventing Him? Rather, this is what the Holy One blessed be He is saying: When I examine the ledgers of the nations of the world and no merit will be found for them before Me, at that moment, I will seek to destroy all the nations. <br>Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is written: “Vengeance and recompense are Mine at the time that their foot will falter” (Deuteronomy 32:35). Is it heroism for a person to say that when the enemies of Israel<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">“Enemies of Israel” refers to Israel. Rabbinic custom was to substitute “enemies of Israel” for Israel when referring to Israel’s evil deeds or the consequences thereof.</i> falter, I will punish them? Rather, this is what the Holy One blessed be He said: When they cease fulfilling the mitzvot that are customary<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Hebrew <i>regilot</i>, a play on <i>regel</i>, foot, in the verse.</i> among them, and no merit will be found for them before Me, at that moment, “vengeance and recompense are Mine.” <br>Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Levi, and Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Levi, and Rabbi Yudan in the name of Rabbi Levi, the three of them said one verse: “Your hand will find all Your enemies; Your right hand will find [<i>timtza</i>] Your foes” (Psalms 21:9). Your hand will be present [<i>metzuya</i>] to repay Your enemies, You will present [<i>tamtze</i>] the attribute of justice to them, You will present [<i>tamtze</i>] them with how few are the good deeds they performed; therefore, it says: “Your hand will find all Your enemies.”
Another matter: “One hundred and twenty-seven provinces” – Rabbi Yuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: Rabbi Yuda said: He conquered seven that were as difficult as twenty; he conquered twenty that were as difficult as one hundred. Rabbi Neḥemya said: He took troops from seven and conquered twenty; he took troops from twenty and conquered one hundred. How did he conquer them? Rabbi Yuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: Rabbi Yuda said: Like a semi-circle, you conquer the outer areas and the inner areas become conquered by themselves. Rabbi Pinḥas said: The world is circular. Rabbi Avun said: It is like the surface of a two-<i>kav</i> vessel.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kav</i> is measure of volume. A two-<i>kav</i> vessel contains slightly less than three liters.</i> Rabbi Neḥemya said: It is like an aqueduct; you conquer the outsides and the insides are conquered by themselves.
Rabbi Akiva was sitting and lecturing and his students [began] dozing. He sought to rouse them; he said: Why did Esther merit to rule over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces? Rather, so said the Holy One blessed be He: Let Esther, the daughter of Sarah, who lived one hundred and twenty-seven years, come and rule over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces. Rabbi Levi said: Everywhere that it says field, it is a town [<i>ir</i>]; a town, a city [<i>medina</i>]; a city, a province. From where is a field a town? As it is stated: “Go to Anatot, to your fields” (I Kings 2:26); from where is a town [<i>ir</i>], a city? As it is stated: “Pass through the midst of the town [<i>ir</i>], through the midst of Jerusalem” (Ezekiel 9:4). A city [<i>medina</i>], a province, as it is stated: “One hundred and twenty-seven provinces [<i>medina</i>].”

<b> “In those days, when King Aḥashverosh was sitting on his royal throne that was in the Shushan citadel” (Esther 1:2). </b><br>This is one of the places<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">The reference to  “places” is unclear. It perhaps refers to places in Scripture. Alternatively, it could mean non-specifically, “one of the times.”</i> that the ministering angels were passing notes before the Holy One blessed be He, saying before Him: Master of the universe, the Temple is in ruins and this wicked man is sitting and making drinking parties. He said to them: Set days against days; that is what is written: “In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on Shabbat...” (Nehemiah 13:15). Rabbi Ḥelbo said: Alas, those were days of woe. Rabbi Bevai said: “Those [<i>hahem</i>] days” – <i>ha</i> (an expression of woe) for those days. That is what you say: “Wail, woe for the day” (Ezekiel 30:2). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Lamentations for those days. That is what you say: “A lamentation will be lamented” (Micha 2:4).
“When King [Aḥashverosh] was sitting [<i>keshevet hamelekh</i>].” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The nations of the world do not sit securely. They objected: Is it not written: “When King [Aḥashverosh] was sitting”? He said to them: <i>Beshevet hamelekh</i> [while the king was sitting] is not written here, rather, <i>keshevet hamelekh</i> [as if the king were sitting] – sitting that is not sitting. However, the sitting of Israel is sitting, as it is stated: “When Israel sat [<i>beshevet</i>] in Ḥeshbon and its environs” (Judges 11:26).
“On his royal throne” – Rabbi Kohen in the name of Rabbi Azarya: “On his royal throne [<i>kisse malkhuto</i>],” <i>malkhuto </i>is written [without the <i>vav</i>]. He sought to sit on Solomon’s throne but they did not allow him to do so. They said to him: Any king who is not ruler of the world may not sit on it. He arose and made a throne of his own, in his image. That is what is written: “On his royal throne [<i>kisse malkhuto</i>],” <i>malkhuto </i>is written [without the <i>vav</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The defective spelling symbolizes the incompleteness of his reign.</i><br>What throne was it? “The king [Solomon] made a great throne of ivory” (I Kings 10:18; II Chronicles 9:17). Rabbi Aḥa said: But isn’t it written: “Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria” (II Kings 10:1). Rabbi Hoshaya said: Just as he had seventy sons in Samaria, so he had seventy sons in Yizre’el. Each and every one had two palaces, one for the winter and one for the summer. That is what is written: “I will strike the winter house with the summer house” (Amos 3:15). Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: Four, as it is stated: “And the ivory houses will be demolished” (ibid.). The Rabbis said: Six, as it is stated: “And many houses will be destroyed – the utterance of the Lord” (ibid.). And here it says: “A great throne of ivory”? (I Kings 10:18; II Chronicles 9:17).<br>Rabbi Hoshaya the Great said: It was made according to the specifications of the chariot of the One who spoke and the world came into existence, the Holy One blessed be He. And so it says: “There were six stairs to the throne” (I Kings 10:19; II Chronicles 9:18) – six stairs corresponding to six heavens. But aren’t there seven? Rabbi Avun said: That where the King resides is separate. <br>Six [stairs] corresponding to six lands [i.e., types of lands]: Land, Ground, Earth, Valley, Desert, Desolation, and World,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">World is the seventh ‘land,’ and is the place from which God judges the others.</i> and it is written: “He will judge the world in righteousness, He will administer fair judgment to the nations” (Psalms 9:9). <br>Six corresponding to the six orders of the Mishna: <i>Zera’im</i> – Seeds; <i>Moed </i>– Appointed times; <i>Nashim </i>– Women; <i>Nezikin </i> – Damages; <i>Kodashim </i> – Consecrations; <i>Teharot</i> – Purities.<br>Six, corresponding to the six days of Creation.<br>Six corresponding to the six matriarchs: Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, Rachel, Bilha, Zilpa.<br>Rav Huna said: Six corresponding to the six mitzvot about which the king is cautioned and commanded, as it is written: “He shall not amass wives for himself” (Deuteronomy 17:17); “he shall not amass horses for himself” (Deuteronomy 17:16); “and silver and gold, he shall not amass greatly” (Deuteronomy 17:17); “You shall not distort judgment, you shall not give preference, and you shall not take a bribe” (Deuteronomy 16:19).<br>When he [Solomon] ascended the first step, the herald would proclaim and say to him: “He shall not amass wives for himself.” On the second, he would proclaim: “He shall not amass horses for himself.” On the third, he would proclaim: “And silver and gold, he shall not amass.” On the fourth, “you shall not distort judgment.” On the fifth, “you shall not give preference.” On the sixth, “you shall not take a bribe.” And so it says [about the throne which was on the sixth step]: “There were arm rests on this side and that side of the place of the seat” (I Kings 10:19). When he came to sit, he [the herald] would say to him: Know before whom you sit, before the He who spoke and the world came into existence.<br>They said: Once Solomon died, Shishak, king of Egypt, came and took it [the throne] from them. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Shishak is Pharaoh, and why is he called by the name Shishak? Because he came against Israel with enthusiasm [<i>bishkikut</i>] and said: I am taking it in payment for my daughter’s marriage contract. He waged war with Zeraḥ the Kushite and he took it from him. Asa waged war with Zeraḥ the Kushite who fell by his hand and he took it from him. It was taught: Asa and all the kings of Judah sat upon it. When Nebuchadnezzar came up and destroyed Jerusalem, he exiled it to Babylon, and from Babylon to Media, from Media to Greece, and from Greece to Edom [Rome]. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei said: I saw its fragments in Rome. Nebuchadnezzar sat upon it, Cyrus sat upon it, Aḥashverosh sought to sit upon it but they did not allow him to do so. They said to him: Any king who has not become ruler of the world may not sit on it. He arose and made one of his own like it; that is what is written: “On his royal throne [<i>kisse malkhuto</i>],” <i>malkhuto </i>is written [without the <i>vav</i>].” <br>“And there was a round top to the throne, at its back” (I Kings 10:19) –  Rabbi Aḥa said: Like this round headrest of an armchair. “There were arm rests on this side and that side of the place of the seat” (ibid.). He ascends the first step, and the lion extends its foreleg to him. On the second, the eagle extends its leg to him. “Of the place of the seat,” this is how they greeted him, and at the place of the seat, there was a golden scepter behind it, and a dove was set in its top with a golden crown in its mouth, so that the king would be sitting on the seat with a golden crown [suspended just above him], touching but not touching.
Rabbi Ayevu said: It is written: “For dominion belongs to the Lord; He rules over nations” (Psalms 22:29), yet you say, “when King Aḥashverosh was sitting on his royal throne”?<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Isn’t it actually God’s royal throne?</i> Rather, in the past, there was royal sovereignty in Israel. When they sinned, sovereignty was taken from them and given to the nations of the world; that is what is written: “I will sell the land into the hands of the wicked” (Ezekiel 30:12). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Into the hands of evil stewards; tomorrow, when Israel repents, the Holy One blessed be He will take it from the idolaters and returns it to Israel. When? “Saviors will ascend Mount Zion” (Ovadya 1:21).
“That was in  the Shushan citadel” – Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Ḥananel: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Cyrus referred to the name of His city and the name of His province,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The name of God’s city and God’s province.</i>as he said: “In Jerusalem, which is in Judah” (Ezra 1:2); I, too, will refer to the name of your city and the name of your province, as it is stated: “That was in the Shushan citadel which is in the province of Elam” (Daniel 8:2).
<b>“In the third year of his reign, he made a banquet for all his princes and his servants, the elite of Persia and Media, the nobles and governors of the provinces before him” (Esther 1:3).</b><br>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: Rabbi Yehuda said: In the third year of the crafting of the throne. Once he completed the crafting of the throne, “he made a banquet for all his princes and his servants.” Rabbi Neḥemya said: In the third year of the cancellation of the construction of the Temple; once three years since the cancellation of the construction of the Temple were completed, “he made a banquet for all his princes and his servants.” Rabbi Shmuel bar Eimi said: There were four good attributes in that man: He went three years without a crown and without a throne; he waited four years until he found a wife appropriate for him; and he would not do anything without consulting. Rabbi Pinḥas said: And anyone who did him a favor, he would record it; that is what is written: “It was found written that Mordekhai had told...” (Esther 6:2).
“He made a banquet for all his princes and his servants.”  Antoninus made a feast for Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who said to him: Perhaps you have not fulfilled your obligation to the lamplighters? He said to him: Of what significance are they to me? He said to him: Perhaps they will put murky oil in the lamps and ruin the feast. He said to him: From where do you know this? He said to him: From Aḥashverosh, about whom it is written: “He made a banquet for all his princes and his servants.”
“The elite of Persia and Media:” It is taught in the name of Rabbi Natan about these ten measures: There are ten portions of licentiousness in the world, nine in Alexandria and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of wealth in the world, nine in Rome and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of poverty in the world, nine in Lydia<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">‘Lydia’ refers to the district in Asia Minor. Alternatively, this could be Lod, the town in Judea.</i> and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of sorcery in the world, nine in Egypt and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of foolishness in the world, nine among the Ishmaelites and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of vigor in the world, nine among the Ishmaelites and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of lice in the world, nine among the Persians and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of attractiveness in the world, nine in Media and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of ugliness in the world, nine in the East and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of power in the world, nine among the Chaldeans and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of courage in the world, nine in Judah and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of beauty in the world, nine in Jerusalem and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of wisdom in the world, nine in the Land of Israel and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of Torah in the world, nine in the Land of Israel and one in the rest of the world. There are ten portions of hypocrisy in the world, nine in Jerusalem and one in the rest of the world; that is what is written: “…for from the prophets of Jerusalem hypocrisy has gone out to all the land” (Jeremiah 23:15).
Another matter: “The elite of Persia and Media” – sometimes Media precedes Persia and sometimes Persia precedes Media. When the throne is in Media, Persia is secondary to it; when the throne is in Persia, Media is secondary to it. [Regarding] Persia, why do they call it Persia [<i>Paras</i>]? Because it received hegemony in pieces [<i>perusot</i>] [non-consecutively], once in the days of Terada, once in the days of Adarkian, and once in the future; that is what is written: “This shall be peace: When Assyria will come into our land and when it will tread in our palaces...”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands Assyria in the verse to refer to Persia.</i>  (Micah 5:4). [Regarding] Media, why do they call it Media [<i>Madai</i>]? Because they acknowledge [<i>modaya</i>] the Holy One blessed be He. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: The kings of Media were upright, and the Holy One blessed be He has nothing against them other than the idolatry that was bequeathed to them by their ancestors.
The nobles – Rabbi Elazar said: The nobles are the king’s two legions, as the king is not called Augustus (i.e. emperor) until they call him that first, and these are they. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The Decumanians and the Augustans [legions].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">These are clearly Latin terms and presumably based on Roman units that were close to the emperor. Some have suggested that these are the Praetorian Guards, transplanted here to a Babylonian/Persian context.</i> It was they who counseled Nebuchadnezzar and he went up and destroyed the Temple. The Holy One blessed be He destroyed them utterly and established others in their stead, and these were they. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Elazar: They were the capable and the literate; Rav Huna said: Those possessing reason and their deputies; Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Those possessing reason were his counselors; that is what you say: “Then Daniel responded with counsel and discretion” (Daniel 2:14).
“And governors of the provinces before him.” Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Rabbi Elazar said: Like the court in Geder, where the king sits in judgment above, and all the people sit before him on the ground. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Like the great basilica filled with people, with the king sitting on his couch and all the people prostrated before him; that is why it says: “And governors of the provinces before him.”

Chapter 2

The fool vents all his spirit, and the wise will soothe it, restraining it” (Proverbs 29:11). “The fool vents all his spirit” – this is Aḥashverosh; “and the wise will soothe it, keeping it back” – this is the Holy One, blessed be He, who soothes Aḥashverosh. That is what you said: “Who stills the raging seas, the raging waves, and the tumult of the peoples” (Psalms 65:8).<br><b>“With his display of the wealth of his glorious kingdom, and the honor of his splendid majesty for many days, one hundred and eighty days” (Esther 1:4).</b><br> “Of the wealth of his glorious kingdom” – the school of Rabbi Yannai and Ḥizkiyya both said that he [Aḥashverosh] would open [his treasury] and display six treasures each day.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The verse lists six words that relate to Aḥashverosh’s wealth: <i>Osher</i>, <i>kevod</i>, <i>malkhuto</i>, <i>yekar</i>, <i>tiferet</i>, <i>gedulato</i>.</i> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: He showed them various types of expenditures. Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said: He showed them the feast of the Land of Israel. Rabbi Levi said: He showed them the vestments of the High Priest. Here it is stated: “His splendid [<i>tiferet</i>] majesty” and there it is stated: “You shall make holy vestments for Aaron your brother, for glory and for splendor [<i>tiferet</i>]” (Exodus 28:2). Just as <i>tiferet</i> stated there refers to the vestments of the High Priest, so does <i>tiferet</i> stated here refer to the vestments of the High Priest.<br>Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: The raven flaunts both what is its own and what is not its own. From where did that wicked one become wealthy? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Nebuchadnezzar, may he be crushed and obliterated, gathered all the riches of the world, and he was possessive of his riches. When he was dying, he said: Shall I leave all these riches to Evil [Merodakh, his son]? He immediately decreed that great bronze ships be built; he filled them with riches, dug and buried them adjacent to the Euphrates, and diverted the Euphrates over them. On the day that Cyrus arose and decreed that the Temple will be built, the Holy One blessed be He exposed them; that is what is written: “So said the Lord to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I held to subdue nations before him…and gates will not be shut” (Isaiah 45:1), and it is written thereafter: “I will give you treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places…” (Isaiah 45:3).
“Many days” – days of suffering, and similarly: “It was during those many days…the children of Israel sighed due to the work, and they cried out, and their plea rose to God from the work” (Exodus 2:23). Were they, in fact, many days? Rather, because they were days of suffering, Scripture related to them as though they were many days. <br>Similarly: “Many days passed, and the word of the Lord was with Elijah in the third year...”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The third year of a drought decreed by Elijah.   </i> (I Kings 18:1). Were they, in fact, many days? Rather, because they were days of suffering, Scripture calls them many days. How many were they? Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: One month in the first year, one month in the last year, and twelve months in the middle, for a total of fourteen months. <br>And similarly: “[And a woman, if her bloody discharge shall flow] many days” (Leviticus 15:25). Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Days – two, many – three. Are they, in fact, many? Rather, because they are days of suffering, Scripture calls them many days.
“One hundred and eighty days” – the last day was like the first day. There was an incident involving a certain man whose name was Barbohin. Our Sages went to him regarding matters of fundraising for the Sages. They heard his son saying to him: ‘What are we eating today?’ He said to him: ‘Endives.’  ‘From those sold at one per <i>maneh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A small silver coin.</i> or from those sold at two per <i>maneh</i>?’ He said to him: ‘From those sold at two per <i>maneh</i>, as those are withered and inexpensive.’ They said: ‘What are we doing going to this [person]? Let us go and do our business in the city and afterward we will come to him.’ They went and did their business and came to him. They said: ‘Give us a donation for charity.’ He said to them: ‘Go to the one who is in the house and she will give you a modius<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A Roman measure of volume, around nine liters.</i>  of dinars.’ They went to the wife and said to her: ‘Your husband said that you should give us a modius of dinars.’ She said to them: ‘What did he say to you, heaping or level?’ They said to her: ‘He did not specify.’ She said: ‘I will give you heaping, and if my husband asks why, I will say that I gave it from the account of my marriage settlement.’<br>They came to him and said to him: ‘May your Creator fill all you lack.’ He said to them: ‘What did she give you, level or heaping?’ They said to him: ‘We said to her that you did not specify, and she said: I will give you heaping, and if my husband says why, [tell him] I gave the extra from my marriage settlement.’ He said to them: ‘Indeed, that is what I intended to give to you. Why didn’t you come to me before?’<br>They said to him: ‘We heard your servant, who said to you: What are we eating today? You said to him: Endives. He said to you: From those sold at one per <i>maneh</i> or from those sold at two per <i>maneh</i>? You said to him: From those sold at two per <i>maneh</i>, as those are withered and inexpensive. We said: A person who has all this money, would he eat endives sold at two per <i>maneh</i>?’ He said: ‘For myself, I am permitted [to be frugal]; however, regarding the commandments of my Creator I am unable and I am not permitted.’<br>Bar Lofyani was marrying his daughter [and the procession was] from Tzippori to Akko. He established stands dispensing wine from Tzippori to Akko and with golden lamps on either side. They said: They did not move from there until he fed them lentils from the threshing floor and gave them wine from the winepress to drink. Rabbi Avun said: And only in charred pots.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">They had already finished all the other food and wine, and all he had left to use were charred pots to serve the last of the food.</i> However, here [at Aḥashverosh’s banquet], the last day was like the first day.
Rabbi Ḥiyya had a gentile friend in Ashna, who prepared a feast for him, during which he served him everything that had been created in the six days of Creation. He said to him: ‘What is your God going to prepare for you in the future that is more than this?’ He said to him: “Your feast has a limit; however, the feast that our God is going to prepare for the righteous in the future has no limit, as it is written: “No eye has seen, besides You, God, what will be done for one who awaits Him”’ (Isaiah 64:3).<br>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai had a friend who lived near his residence in Tyre. One time he came to him and he heard his servant saying to him: ‘What are we eating today, [thin] lentil soup or [thick] lentil stew?’ He said to him: ‘Lentil soup.’ He began speaking to him [the servant], and he [the friend] sensed him [that Rabbi Shimon overheard the conversation]. He sent and told the members of his household: ‘Set for me all these fine vessels.’ He said [to Rabbi Shimon]: ‘Will the Rabbi agree to drink with us today?’ He [Rabbi Shimon] said: ‘Yes.’ When he entered the house, he saw the fine vessels and wondered; he said to him: ‘Does a person who has all these possessions eat lentil soup?’ He said to him: ‘Rabbi, you, your Torah accords you honor; however, we, were it not for our belongings, there would be no person who would honor us.’<br>Bar Yoḥani sought to make a feast for the prominent people of Rome. Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei was there; he said: Let us consult with the resident of our city [Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei]. He came to him and said to him: ‘If you wish to invite twenty, prepare for twenty-five. And if you wish to invite twenty-five, prepare for thirty.’ He went and prepared for twenty-four and invited twenty-five. It was found that there was a portion missing from before one of them; one said it was a <i>kindas</i> [an edible thistle], and one said it was unripe dates.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Both of these are particularly inexpensive, low-quality foods.</i> He brought gold and placed it before him [the guest who had not received his portion]. He took it and cast it in his face; he said to him: ‘Do I eat gold; do I need your gold?’ <br>He [Bar Yoḥani] came before Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei and related the incident to him. He said to him: ‘By your life, Rabbi, I shouldn’t have related it to you, as I did not do what you told me. For this reason I told you – to determine whether the Holy One blessed be He revealed to you [only] the intricacies of Torah, or perhaps the intricacies of feasts as well.’ He said to him: ‘Yes, even the intricacies of feasts He revealed to us.’ He said to him: ‘From where do you know this?’ He said to him; ‘From David, as it is written: “Avner came to David, to Hebron, and with him were twenty men. And David made for Avner, and for the men who were with him, a feast” (II Samuel 3:20). He made a feast is not written here, but rather: “for the men who were with him a feast.”’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He made the feast for all the men who might come with Avner.</i> Here [at Aḥashverosh’s banquet], however, the last day was like the first day [and no one lacked for anything].<br><b>“Upon the completion of those days, the king made for all the people who were present in the Shushan citadel, great and small, a banquet for seven days, in the courtyard of the garden of the king's palace” (Esther 1:5).</b>
“Upon the completion of [<i>uvimlot</i>] those days” – it is written <i>uvimlot</i> [plene, with the extra <i>vav</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear if this is merely a textual note or somehow related to the following dispute between Rav and Shmuel.</i> “the king made for all the people who were present…a banquet for seven days.” Rav and Shmuel: One said: Seven, besides the one hundred and eighty. And Shmuel said: Seven, included in the one hundred and eighty. Rabbi Simon said: This Shushan citadel was like a royal court,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the Hebrew word <i>komititon</i>, which comes from the Latin <i>commesatio</i>, meaning a drunken revel.</i> stocked with food and drink. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: The great men of the generation were there and they fled.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The Jewish dignitaries fled because they heard that the king was displaying the Temple vessels and demeaning them.</i> Rabbi Ḥanina bar Atal said: Jews were there at that feast. That wicked one [Aḥashverosh] said to them: ‘Is your God capable of preparing more than this for you?’ They said to him: ‘“No eye has seen, besides You, God, what will be done for one who awaits Him” (Isaiah 64:3). Were He to make a feast like this for us, we would say to Him: We already ate this at the table of Aḥashverosh.’
“In the courtyard of the garden of the king's palace” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: Rabbi Yehuda said: The garden was on the outside and the courtyard on the inside. Rabbi Neḥemya said: The garden was on the inside and the courtyard on the outside. Rabbi Pinḥas said: I sustain both of your statements; when he wanted, he made it a courtyard, and when he wanted, he made it a garden. How so? He would unfurl the curtain and render it a courtyard, furl the curtain and render it a garden. Alternatively, “in the courtyard of the garden of the king’s palace” – that it cost a lot of money.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, this reading is based on the word <i>bitan</i> (palace) being read as a form of the verb <i>natan</i>, meaning give. Accordingly, the expression “the courtyard of the garden of the king’s palace [<i>bitan</i>] should be understood as “the courtyard of the garden for which the king gave [a lot].”</i>
<b>“Hangings of  white [<i>ḥur</i>], green [<i>karpas</i>] and blue [<i>tekhelet</i>],  fastened with cords of fine linen and purple wool on silver rods and marble pillars, couches of gold and silver, on a floor of alabaster, marble, mother-of-pearl, and onyx” (Esther 1:6). </b><br>“<i>Ḥur</i>, <i>karpas</i>, and <i>tekhelet</i>” – Akelas translated it: White [<i>ḥur</i>] and green [<i>karpas</i>] linen. Rav Beivai said: sky-blue [<i>tekhelet</i>]. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Like garments that free men wear. “Fastened with cords of fine linen and purple wool” –  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Come and see what the clothing of that wicked one was like; everyone hangs [curtains] with cords of [simple] wool and cords of [simple] linen, and this wicked one [hangs curtains] with cords of fine linen and purple wool. “On silver rods” – Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta: One said: They were furled like the curtain of a cabinet. The other said: They were folded like the sails of a ship. <br>“And pillars of marble,” – the quarry [from which the marble came] was not revealed to any creature other than to [those from] this wicked kingdom. They objected: But is it not written [regarding the materials assembled for the construction of the Temple]: “And all precious stones and marble stones in abundance” (I Chronicles 29:2)? Solomon would place a gem on one side and a gem on the other side with the marble stones between them. It was easier for Aḥashverosh to craft pillars of silver and gold than to bring pillars of marble from Perak Onsin to Media. If you say that they were cut [into small pieces and reassembled], Rabbi Mattana said: I slept on the capital of one of them, and it was the width of my height with arms and legs extended.
“Couches of gold and silver” – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya: Rabbi Yehuda said: For one [for whom] silver was fitting, silver, and for one [for whom] gold was fitting, gold. Rabbi Neĥemya said to him: If so, you would be instigating jealousy at the feast of that wicked one. Rather, they were gold, and their clasps were silver. Shmuel said: The outer side facing was gold and the inner side was silver.
“On a floor of alabaster, marble, mother-of-pearl, and onyx.” Rav Naḥman said: Come and see what the comfort of that wicked one was like. His house was paved with precious stones and pearls. “Alabaster [<i>bahat</i>], marble [<i>shesh</i>], mother-of-pearl [<i>dar</i>], and onyx [<i>soḥaret</i>]. Rabbi Nisa of Caesarea said: <i>Bahat</i> is like a pearl whose owner is particularly fond of it. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: [<i>Dar</i>] is like a pearl that sets its owner free; that is what you said: “Proclaim liberty [<i>deror</i>]” (Leviticus 25:10). “Mother-of-pearl [<i>dar</i>]” – Rav Huna said: There is a place where they call a pearl <i>dura</i>. “Onyx [<i>soḥaret</i>]” – Rav Beiva bar Avuna said: Ready merchandise; that is what you said: “Ready currency [<i>over lasoḥer</i>]” (Genesis 23:16).
<b>“Drink was served in vessels of gold and vessels of diverse kinds, and abundant royal wine, in keeping with the king’s bounty” (Esther 1:7).</b><br>“Drink was served in vessels of gold” – all the drinks served by that wicked one were only in gold vessels. They objected: But is it not written: “All the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of the Lebanon were of pure gold”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The question lies in the fact that drinking out of gold vessels does not appear to have been unique to Aḥasheverosh’s court (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> (I Kings 10:21)? Rabbi Pinḥas says in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Is it not disgusting to drink wine in a gold vessel? Rather, these were goblets of finely-crafted crystal, in which their images were mirrored, and they were as beautiful and valuable as gold vessels.
“And vessels of diverse kinds” – he brought his vessels and vessels of Elam, and his were more beautiful than those from Elam. He brought his vessels and the Temple vessels, and they were found to be finer and more beautiful than his. [This is comparable] to a woman who had a beautiful maidservant; whenever she would look at her maidservant, her face would change color. So too, whenever the Temple vessels would be shown with his vessels, his vessels would change and appear like lead. Rabbi Taḥlifa bar bar Ḥana said: [“Vessels of diverse kinds”] – vessels whose form changes after a few days.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning that were extremely fragile and frequently broke (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Naḥman: Vessels that destroy those who use them while they [those using the vessels] persist in their corruption. Who caused Belshatzar’s foundations to be undermined, was it not because he used the Temple vessels? That is what is written: “Belshatzar said, as he tasted the wine, to bring the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father had removed…” (Daniel 5:2). What is written? “During that night, Belshatzar the Chaldean king was killed” (Daniel 5:30).
“And abundant royal wine.” Later it is written: “[King Belshazzar made a great banquet for his thousand nobles,] and before the thousand he drank wine” (Daniel 5:1); however, here it is written: “And abundant royal wine, in keeping with the king’s bounty [<i>keyad hamelekh</i>],” – like the number of goblets in the hand of the king [<i>beyad hamelekh</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Aḥashverosh, in contrast to Belshatzar, allowed his nobles to drink as much as he did.</i>
<b>“The drinking was as customary, without coercion, for so did the king establish with all the stewards of his house, to do as every man desired.” (Esther 1:8). </b><br>“The drinking was as customary, without coercion” – in accordance with the custom of each place. There is a place where people wish to eat and then to drink, and there is a place where one drinks and then eats. According to the custom of every nation; like those Kutites, who do not drink wine from wineskins, they brought them wine in earthenware vessels. “Without coercion” – undiluted wine; Rav said: “Without coercion” – [no one was coerced] to drink wine of libation. Rabbi Binyamin Bar Levi said: There was no coercion [to drink] with a large goblet, because there [in Persia] they would drink excessively; therefore, there was no coercion to drink from a large goblet.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">It was customary for Persians to drink from an unusually large cup.</i> <br>“For so did the king establish [<i>yissad</i>]” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Come and see the comfort of that wicked one, as his house was ornamented [<i>meyusad</i>] with jewels and pearls. “With all the stewards of his house” – to arrange for the prominent subjects of the kingdom, so each and every one of them would be able to enjoy himself with his children and the members of his household.
“To do as every man desired.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I do not fulfill the wishes of all My creatures, and you seek “to do as every man desired?”’ The way of the world is that if two men seek to marry one woman, can she marry them both? Rather, it is either to one, or to the other. Likewise, if two ships were waiting in harbor, one seeking a north wind and one seeking a south wind, can one wind propel both of them together? Rather, it is either for one or for the other. Tomorrow, two people will come before you for judgment, a Jewish man, and an adversary and enemy, can you satisfy both of them? Rather, you elevate one and hang the other. <br>Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Binyamin bar Levi: Because in this world, when the northern wind blows, the southern wind does not blow, and when the southern wind blows, the northern wind does not blow. However, in the future, with the ingathering of the exiles, the Holy One blessed be He will say: ‘I am bringing an unusual wind to the world, in which two winds serve simultaneously.’ That is as it is written: “I will say to the north: Give, and to the south: Do not withhold; bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the ends of the earth” (Isaiah 43:6). Who is it who does the will of those who fear Him? It is the Holy One blessed be He about whom it is written: “He performs the will of those who fear him, and He hears their cry and delivers them” (Psalms 145:19).

Chapter 3

Rav began: “Woe! He gives drink to his neighbor, amplifies your wrath, and intoxicates him, so that you may look upon their nakedness” (Habakkuk 2:15). “Woe! He gives drink” – that is Nebuchadnezzar; “his neighbor” – that is Zedekiah. The Holy One blessed be He said to him [Nebuchadnezzar]: ‘Wicked one, is he not a king like you? Is he not a shepherd like you?’ “Amplifies your wrath” – ‘why are you leveling accusations against him in your wrath?’ He [Nebuchadnezzar] said to him [Zedekiah]: ‘Had you rebelled against me and not rebelled against your God, your God would have stood beside you. Had you rebelled against your God and not rebelled against me, I would have stood beside you. However, you rebelled against your God and rebelled against me,’– that is what is written: “He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had administered an oath to him by God” (II Chronicles 36:13). Upon what did he administer the oath? Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Ḥanina said: He administered the oath on the horns of the inner altar. What would that wicked one [Nebuchadnezzar] do to him [Zedekiah]? He would feed him warm barley bread and give him wine from the winepress to drink. Why did he do so? He did so to empty his bowels; that is what is written: “So that you may look upon their nakedness.”<br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak said: Your honor and the honor of your ancestors: You became royalty only because your grandfather respected his grandfather; that is what is written: “At that time Merodakh Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent scrolls and a gift to Hezekiah; he had heard that he had become ill and recovered” (Isaiah 39:1). They said: Merodakh Baladan was a sun worshipper, and he was accustomed to eat at the sixth hour and sleep until the ninth hour. On that day, when the sphere of the sun reversed its course during the days of Hezekiah, he slept until the ninth hour and awakened at the fourth hour. Once he awoke from his sleep, he sought to kill all his servants. He said to them: ‘You allowed me to sleep the entire day and the entire night.’ They said to him: ‘No, rather, the sphere of the sun reversed its course.’<br>He said to them: ‘Is there a god who is greater than my god, who is capable of reversing it?’ They said to him: ‘Hezekiah’s God is greater than your god.’ Immediately he arose and sent [letters]: Peace to Hezekiah, peace to the God of Hezekiah, and peace to Jerusalem. Once the letters and messengers were on their way, he was calmed and he said: ‘I have honored Hezekiah only because of his God, and I offered salutations to Hezekiah, who is flesh and blood, before [I offered] salutations to his God?’ Immediately, he arose from his throne and took three steps, and sent messengers to recall the letters and wrote other scrolls: Peace to the great God of Hezekiah, peace to Hezekiah, and peace to Jerusalem. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: You arose from your throne and took three steps for the glory of My name; by your life, I will establish from you three kings, who will rule the entire world from one end to the other end, and these are they – Nebuchadnezzar, Evil Merodakh, and Belshatzar. That is why The Holy One blessed be He said [to Zedekiah, the last king of Judah]:  ‘Your honor and your honored grandfather and father became kings only because he [Merodakh Baladan] honored this king’s grandfather [Hizkiyyahu], and you are dishonoring him?’ <br>“You are sated with more shame than glory; you too, drink and be exposed! The cup in the right hand of the Lord shall come around to you, and disgrace upon your glory” (Habakkuk 2:16). “More shame than glory” –  Zedekiah my son is being dishonored in the manner that anyone is dishonored, but you [Nebuchadnezzar], “disgrace [<i>kikalon</i>] upon your glory” – vomiting [<i>ki</i>] above and shame [<i>kalon</i>] below. Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav said: When the two commanders of his legions saw that he was vomiting above and being shamed below, they stood him from his throne, removed his crown from upon his head, and removed his royal cloak from upon him; that is what is written: “They removed his honor from him” (Daniel 5:20), and they stood him in his nakedness; the nakedness of shame.<br>Who were the commanders of his legions? Cyrus and Darius. Rabbi Menaḥem, son-in-law of Rabbi Eliezer bar Avina, said in the name of Rabbi Yaakov bar Avina: The entire household of that wicked one are only judged naked. “You too, drink and be exposed naked” (Habakkuk 2:16), this is Nebuchadnezzar; “you too,” this is Belshatzar, “and be exposed naked,” this is Vashti.
<b>“Also, Vashti the queen made a women’s banquet in the royal palace of King Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:9). </b><br>Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon began: “My people, its oppressors are babes and women govern them” (Isaiah 3:12). “My people, its oppressors are babes [<i>meolel</i>]” – they are exacting with them, as you say: “Do to them [<i>veolel lamo</i>] as You did to me” (Lamentations 1:22). <br>Another interpretation: “<i>Meolel</i>” – they pick their unripe grapes [<i>olelot</i>]; that is what you say: “Your vineyard you shall not harvest completely [<i>teolel</i>]” (Leviticus 19:10). They come against them with false accusations [<i>alilot</i>]; that is what you say: “He made a false accusation [<i>alilot devarim</i>] against her” (Deuteronomy 22:14). Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: There are [male] cult prostitutes among them; that is what you say: “There shall not be a cult prostitute from the daughters of Israel, and there shall not be a cult prostitute from the sons of Israel” (Deuteronomy 23:18); that is what you say: “They abused her [<i>vayitallelu</i>] all night”<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The word <i>vayitallelu</i> is used to the refer to the raping of the concubine in Giva, showing that this word can refer to licentiousness.</i> (Judges 19:25). “And women govern them” – four women assumed dominion in the world: Jezebel and Atalya from Israel, and Shemiramit and Vashti from the nations of the world.
Another interpretation: “Also, Vashti the queen” – Shmuel began: “When they are inflamed, I will set out their banquet [and get them drunk, that they revel and then sleep an endless sleep, never to awake, says the Lord]” (Jeremiah 51:39). The Holy One blessed be He said: When they come to inflame themselves with their monarchy, “I will set out [<i>ashit</i>] their banquet [<i>mishteihem</i>]” – I will cut down their foundations [<i>mishtoteihem</i>]; “and I will get them drunk” – with their troubles; “that they revel” – because they rejoiced over the destruction of the Temple. The Holy One blessed be He said: The Temple is in ruins and this wicked man is making drinking parties. Wicked Vashti is also making drinking parties, as it is written: “Also, Vashti the queen, made a women’s banquet.”
Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “But you did not call Me, Jacob, for you wearied of Me, Israel” (Isaiah 43:22). Rabbi Yoḥanan understood it [the verse in Isaiah 43:22] from this, as it is written: “A prophecy of Damascus: Behold, Damascus is removed from being a city and it will be a heap of ruins. Abandoned are the cities of Aroer; [they will be for flocks, and they will lie down, and none will threaten]” (Isaiah 17:1–2). What is it that stands in Damascus and evokes Aroer? Isn’t Aroer within the region of Moav? Rather, there were three hundred and sixty-five houses of [different types of] idolatry in Damascus, and they would worship [in]  each one of them on its day. They had one day when they would go around to all of them on that day and worship [all of] them, and Israel assembled them together and worshipped them; that is what is written: “The children of Israel continued to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, and they served the Be'alim, and the Ashtarot, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moav, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines; they forsook the Lord, and they did not serve Him” (Judges 10:6), not even in conjunction with other gods.<br>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Shall a priestess not be like an innkeeper?<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">“Shall a priestess not be like an innkeeper” was apparently a popular saying. Here it means: Should not God be worshipped as much as other gods?</i> Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Ḥanina: The Holy One blessed be He said: My children did not even make me like the dessert that comes at the end. Rabbi Levi said: [This is comparable] to a king’s servant who prepared a feast for his soldiers and invited all the king’s legions and did not invite his master. The king said to him: ‘If only you had treated me like all of my soldiers.’ So too, The Holy One blessed be He said: If only My children had treated me like the dessert that comes at the end; rather, “but you did not call Me, Jacob, for you wearied of Me, Israel” (Isaiah 43:22). Regarding the Baal, what is written? “They called in the name of the Baal from the morning until noon, saying: ‘The Baal, answer us.’ But there was no voice, and none responded” (I Kings 18:26). He sits and talks all day and does not tire, but when standing to pray, he tires; he sits and talks all day and does not tire, but when sitting to study,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verb refers specifically to the practice of reviewing the Oral Torah.</i> he tires. That is: “But you did not call Me, Jacob” – if only I had not known you, Jacob – “for you wearied of Me, Israel” (Isaiah 43:22). “You did not bring Me the sheep of your burnt offerings” (Isaiah 43:23) – these are the two daily offerings, as it is stated: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning” (Numbers 28:4). “And you did not honor Me with your offerings” (Isaiah 43:23) – these are the portions of the offerings of sacred sanctity that are burned on the altar. “I have not burdened you with a meal offering” (Isaiah 43:23) – this is the handful of flour taken from the meal offering. “And I have not wearied you with frankincense” (Isaiah 43:23) – this is the handful of frankincense.<br>“You did not buy a cane [<i>kaneh</i>] for Me with silver” (Isaiah 43:24). Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: Cinnamon [<i>kinamon</i>] grew in the Land of Israel and goats and deer would eat it. “And with the fat of your offerings you did not satisfy Me,” (Isaiah 43:24) – these are the portions of the offerings of lesser sanctity that are burned on the altar. “Rather, you burdened Me with your sins, you wearied Me with your iniquities” (Isaiah 43:24) – look what your sins have caused me, Jacob. Isn’t it enough that you count the days for the banquet of the men, but even made a banquet for the women; that is what is written: “Also, Vashti the queen made a women’s banquet.”
It is written: “You have seen, for You behold mischief and spite; to requite is in Your hand: the helpless man commits himself to You; You are the helper of the orphans” (Psalms 10:14).  The congregation of Israel said before The Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the Universe, You saw that Esau the wicked came, and is destined to destroy the Temple, exile Israel from its land, and shackle them in collars – “You behold…to requite is in Your hand” – yet you rested Your Divine Presence upon Isaac, who said to him [Esau]: “Behold, the fat of the earth shall be your dwelling, and from the dew of the heavens from above” (Genesis 27:39). “The helpless man commits himself to You” –  the next day he [Esau/Rome] comes and takes orphans and widows and incarcerates them in prison, and says to them: Will He about whom it is written: “The father of orphans and the judge of widows” (Psalms 68:6), come and rescue you from me? Rather, You helped his [Esau’s] orphan. Two orphans who remained from him, that is Remus and Romulus, you allowed the wolf to nurse them, and ultimately, they arose and constructed two great towers in Rome.’ <br>Another matter: “You have seen, for You behold mischief and spite…” the congregation of Israel said before The Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the Universe, You saw Nebuchadnezzar the wicked, who came and destroyed the Temple, and exiled Israel, and shackled them in collars. “To requite is in Your hand” – yet You rested Your Divine Presence on Jeremiah, who said to us: “All the nations will serve him [Nebuchadnezzar] and his son and his son's son...” (Jeremiah 27:7). “The helpless man commits himself to You” – the next day he comes and takes Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya and puts them in the fiery furnace, and says to them: “Who is the God who will save you from my hands?” (Daniel 3:15). Rather, it is not, “You are the helper of the orphans,” but one orphan girl remained from him [Nebuchadnezzar] and you made her an empress in a kingdom that was not hers, and who was that? Vashti.’
It is written: “From people by Your hand, O Lord, from people from the world [<i>meḥeled </i>], their portion is in life; Your hidden treasures will fill their bellies; their sons will be satisfied and they will leave their surplus to their young ones” (Psalms 17:14). Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Aḥa went to a place and found that this verse was at the head of the discussion: “The remnant of the meal offering shall be for Aaron and his sons…” (Leviticus 2:3, 10), and began: “From people by Your hand, O Lord” – how courageous are those who took their portion from under the hand of God; and who was that? It was the tribe of Levi. “From people from the world” – these are those who did take a portion in the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is reading “from the world” as removed from the land, i.e. the tribe of Levi, since it did not receive a portion in the Land of Israel.</i> “Their portion is life” – these are the consecrations of the Temple offerings. “Your hidden treasures will fill their bellies” – these are the consecrations of the borders.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Consecrations of the borders refers to <i>teruma</i>, the portion of produce allocated to the priests which they may eat anywhere.</i> “…their sons will be satisfied” – “every male among the priests shall eat it” (Leviticus 6:22). “And they will leave their surplus to their young ones” – “and the remnant of the meal offering shall be for Aaron and his sons…” (Leviticus 2:3, 10).
Another interpretation: “From people [<i>mimtim</i>] by Your hand” – who are these courageous men who took theirs from under the hand of God? And who was that? That was the generation of religious persecution. “From people [<i>mimtim</i>]<i> </i>by your hand” – killed [<i>mumatim</i>] by your hand. “From the world [<i>meḥeled</i>]” – those who had sores [<i>ḥaludaot</i>] arise in their flesh for the sanctification of Your name. Who were they? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai and his son Rabbi Elazar, who went into hiding in a cave for thirteen years due to religious persecution until there arose sores in their flesh. They ate carobs and dates. At the end of thirteen years, Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai emerged and sat at the entrance to the cave. He saw a trapper spreading his trap to trap birds. He heard a divine voice say ‘freedom,’ and it was freed. A second time he heard a divine voice, it said ‘killing,’ and it was caught. He said: ‘Even a bird does not escape without a divine decree; that is all the more so true regarding us. Let us go and be healed in the hot springs of Tiberias.’ They went down and were healed in the hot springs of Tiberias. They said: ‘We must do good and benefit these residents of the place, just as Jacob our patriarch did, as it is stated: “He encamped [<i>vayiḥan</i>] before the city” (Genesis 33:18) – he established a market and sold to them at low prices. They established a market and sold to them at low prices.<br>David said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the Universe, say that I have a place with them in the World to Come.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘David, is it not [written] “your hidden treasures will fill their bellies?” Their hidden treasures will fill your belly is not written here, but rather, “your hidden treasures will fill their bellies.” The entire people partakes of what is left over from your wealth.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">David’s merit is the source of the benefit of the entire nation.</i> <br>David received tidings that he had a portion in the World to Come. Moreover, he said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, these come based on Torah, <i>mitzvot</i>, and good deeds that they have to their credit, but I, “I shall see Your face in righteousness” (Psalms 17:15) forever.’
Another interpretation: “From people by Your hand, O Lord” – how mighty are they who took dominion from under the hand of God. Who is that? That is Nebuchadnezzar. “From people from the world” – those are they who took their portion in the Land. “Their portion is life” – those who took their portion while they were alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In other words, they receive their reward in this world, and do not merit the World to Come.</i> “Your hidden treasures will fill their bellies” – they who became rich from what was hidden in the chamber [of the Temple]. “Their sons will be satisfied” – these are Evil [Merodakh] and Belshatzar.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Nebuchadnezzar’s son and grandson.</i> “And they will leave their surplus to their young ones” – one young one remained for him, and you made her an empress in a kingdom that was not hers, and who was that? That is Vashti.
Another interpretation: “Also, Vashti the queen made a women’s banquet.” Why did Scripture see fit to publicize the banquet of Vashti? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Why to that extent? It is to inform you of the [degree] of luxury to which Esther was entering. Rabbi Meir said: If it is so for those who anger Him, all the more so for those who perform His will. <br>Alternatively, “Also [<i>gam</i>], Vashti the queen” – also [<i>gam</i>] is nothing but an amplification. Just as that one [Aḥashverosh’s banquet] was with six treasures, so was this one [Vashti’s banquet] with six treasures. Just as that one was with a great variety of expenditures, so was this one with a great variety of expenditures. Just as that one was a feast of the Land of Israel, so was this one a feast of the Land of Israel. Just as that one was with the vestments of the High Priest, so was this one with the vestments of the High Priest. Rabbi Berekhya said: Like that raven that flaunts both what is its own and what is not its own.<br>Another interpretation: “Also, Vashti the queen.” “Also” [<i>gam</i>] – also the time had arrived for the foundation [<i>mashtota</i>] of Vashti<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The play on words is between Vashti and <i>mashtota</i>.</i> [to be overturned]. The time had come for Vashti to be cut down [<i>ligamem</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A play on <i>gam</i>.</i> The time had come for Vashti to be harvested. The time had come for Vashti to be trampled [like a grape].<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The association of Vashti with the harvesting or trampling of grapes is a play on the word <i>gam</i>, which sounds similar to <i>guma, </i>the pit or depression in which grapes were pressed.</i> Rabbi Huna said: Her time had arrived to die; that is what you say: “She took of its fruit<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The tree of knowledge of good and evil.</i> and ate and she also [<i>gam</i>] gave to her husband…” (Genesis 3:6).
“[Also [<i>gam</i>], Vashti the queen] made a women’s banquet,” she fed them kinds of soup [<i>gema’in</i>]. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: She fed them kinds of sweets. “In the royal palace” – she situated them in spacious rooms because a woman’s way is to cause damage.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The nature of this damage is unclear. Some understand it to mean that it is a woman’s way to be licentious and for this reason she provided the women with private rooms. Others understand it to mean that women’s clothing is likely to become soiled if rooms are too crowded</i> Alternatively, “in the royal palace” – she situated them in decorated houses, as Rabbi Avun said: A woman prefers decorated houses and decorated garments more than eating fatted calves. Alternatively, “in the royal palace” – she situated them in her reception hall, saying that if the husband of one of them would seek to rebel, his wife would be inside and he would not rebel.<br>“Of King Aḥashverosh,” Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Everywhere in this scroll that King Aḥashverosh is stated, Scripture is referring to King Aḥashverosh. Everywhere that king is stated alone, it can be either sacred [referring to God] or profane [referring to Aḥashverosh].
<b>“On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he said to Mehuman, Bizzeta, Ḥarvona, Bigta, and Avagta, Zetar, and Kharkas, the seven officials who attended King Aḥashverosh,” (Esther 1:10).</b><br>“On the seventh day” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: That was the day of Shabbat. “When the king was merry with wine” – idolaters do not have good [<i>tova</i>], as it is written: “And good [<i>vetov</i>] will not be for the wicked…” (Ecclesiastes 8:13). They objected: Is it not written: “When the king was merry [<i>ketov lev hamelekh</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, when the king’s heart was good. The question arises from the fact that the king’s heart was good even though he was an idolater.</i> with wine”?  He said to him [the person who raised the objection]: “In the good [<i>betov</i>] of the king’s heart” is not written here, rather “like the good [<i>ketov</i>] of the king’s heart” –  good but not good.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ketov</i> is usually translated as “when [the king’s heart was] good,” i.e. when he was merry. The midrash is reading the prepositional prefix <i>ke-</i> to mean approximately, i.e. the king’s heart was approximately good, i.e. good but not good.</i> However, the good for Israel is complete good, as it says [regarding Israel after the inauguration of the first Temple]: “…they went to their tents, joyful and good of heart over all the goodness that the Lord had shown…” (I Kings 8:66).
“He said to Mehuman, Bizzeta, Ḥarvona” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He called the angel who is appointed over fury<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">A reference to the verse: “Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's word by means of the officials, and the king was very angry, and his fury burned within him” (Esther 1:12).</i> and said to him: “Bizzeta” – plunder his house [<i>boz beitei</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">“House,” in this context, can mean his wife.</i> “Ḥarvona” – destroy his house [<i>aḥriv beitei</i>]; “Bigta  and Avagta” – Plunder [<i>buz</i>] and despoil [<i>bizbuz</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Replace the <i>gimmel </i>with a <i>zayin</i>.

<b>“To bring Queen Vashti before the king with a royal crown, to display her beauty to the peoples and the princes, for she was of fair appearance” (Esther 1:11).</b><br>Rabbi Aivu said: The atonement of Israel is that when Israel eats, drinks, and rejoices, they bless, and praise, and acclaim The Holy One blessed be He. But when the nations of the world eat and drink, they engage in matters of lewdness. This one says: Medians are most beautiful; that one says: Persians are most beautiful. That foolish one [Aḥashverosh] said to them: ‘The vessel that this man uses [i.e., that I use] is neither Median nor Persian, but rather Chaldean.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">This is a crude reference to Vashti as his vessel.</i> Do you wish to see it?’ They said to him: ‘Yes, provided that she be naked.’ He said to them: ‘Yes, and naked.’ Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Ḥama bar Gurya say in the name of Rav: She sought to enter with only a sash, like a prostitute, and they would not let her. He [Aḥashverosh] said to us [her attendants]: ‘And naked.’ She said: ‘I will enter without a crown.’<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Vashti thought it would be less humiliating if she was not wearing her crown.</i> ‘They will say that this is a maidservant.’ Even if she wears royal garments and enters [they will say she is a maidservant].

<b>“Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's word by means of the officials, and the king was very angry, and his fury burned within him” (Esther 1:12).</b><br>She sent and said to him things that upset him. She said to him: ‘If they consider me beautiful, they will set their sights on taking advantage of me and will kill you. If they consider me ugly, you will be demeaned because of me.’ She alluded, but he did not grasp the allusions; she provoked him, but he was not provoked. She sent and said to him: ‘Weren’t you the stable boy of my father’s house, and you were accustomed to bringing naked prostitutes before you, and now that you have ascended to the throne, you have not abandoned your corruption.’ She alluded, but he did not grasp the allusions; she provoked him, but he was not provoked.

Rabbi Huna said: In their official garments.<br>Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The Holy One blessed be He punishes the wicked to Gehenna only when they are naked. What is the reason? It is as it is written: “On awakening, You will humiliate their image” (Psalms 73:20). Rav Shmuel bar Naḥman said: In the place that the highwayman afflicts, there he is hanged. Rabbi Natan said: Also the Egyptians, in their descent into the sea, were condemned naked [<i>arumim</i>]. What is the reason? “With the blast of Your nostrils the water was piled [<i>ne’ermu</i>]” (Exodus 15:8). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: The wicked one does not leave the world until The Holy One blessed be He shows him his net in which he will be trapped.
“The king was very angry and his fury burned within him.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: At that moment, The Holy One blessed be He said to the angel appointed over fury: Descend and blow wind into his belly, and fan his embers, and cast sulfur into his furnace. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All those years, from the moment that Vashti was killed until Esther entered, the fury of Aḥashverosh did not abate. They raised an objection – but isn’t it written: “When the fury of King Aḥashverosh had abated [<i>keshokh</i>]” (Esther 2:1)? He said to them: With the abating of [<i>beshokh</i>] the fury of the king is not written here, but rather, like the abating [<i>keshokh</i>]<i> </i>the fury of the king; abating that is not abating.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is reading the prepositional prefix <i>ke-</i> to mean “like” rather than “when,” indicating that the king’s fury only abated somewhat.</i> When did his fury abate? When Haman was impaled; that is what is written: “They hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordekhai, and the king's fury abated” (Esther 7:10) – the fury of the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, abated.

Chapter 4

<b>“The king said to the wise men, those knowledgeable about the times, for so was the practice of the king before those learned in custom and law” (Esther 1:13).</b><br>Who were they? Rabbi Simon said: This is the tribe of Issachar; that is what is written: “From the children of Issachar, possessors of understanding of the times, to know what Israel should do; [their leaders were two hundred, and all their brethren were at their command]” (I Chronicles 12:33).

“Those close to him” (Esther 1:14) – they brought the calamity close to themselves. “Karshena” – who was appointed over the vetch<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A plant used as animal feed.</i> [<i>karshinin</i>]; “Shetar” – who was appointed over the wine [<i>shetiya</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Shetiya </i>means drink.</i> “Admata” – who was appointed over land [<i>adama</i>] surveying; “Tarshish” – who was appointed over the house [which was tiled with <i>tarshish</i> – beryl]; “Meres” – who would blend [<i>memares</i>] the [spices for the] fowl; “Marsena” – who would blend [<i>memares</i>] the fine flours; “Memukhan” – the chief food supplier, whose wife would prepare everything they needed.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">It is not clear whether there is a play on words also with the name Memukhan.

Where was the doom of all of them arranged? Rabbi Hoshaya said: It is from Isaiah the prophet, that is as you say: “Prepare a slaughter for his sons for the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise and inherit the earth…” (Isaiah 14:21).
“The seven princes of Persia and Media” – Rav and Shmuel, Rav said: Scripture is referring to the kingdom of Aḥashverosh, and Shmuel said: Scripture is referring to the kingdom of Belshatzar. According to Rav, who said the kingdom of Aḥashverosh, it works out well. According to Shmuel, who said the kingdom of Belshatzar, how were they [still in power after] all those years? Rabbi Huna said: It was because they [these seven princes] did not make use of the Temple vessels [when Belshatzar did]; that is what is written: “Belshatzar, as he tasted the wine, [said to bring the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the Temple which was in Jerusalem, that the king and his lords, his consorts and his concubines, might drink from them.]” (Daniel 5:2), and as a result: “On that night, Belshatzar the Chaldean king was killed” (Daniel 5:30).
“Who viewed the face of the king” – there were two families [who had permission] to appear before Rabbi Yehuda haNasi; that of Rabbi Hoshaya, and that of the household of Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazzi. After the family of Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazzi married into the family of Rabbi Yehuda haNasi, they sought to enter first, but Rabbi Ammi would not allow them to do so. He said to them, it is written: “You shall establish the Tabernacle in accordance with its law [<i>kemishpato</i>] that you were shown on the mountain” (Exodus 26:30).<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kemishpato</i> in this verse is usually understood to mean in the appropriate manner.</i> Is there  law for wood?

<b>“According to the law, what shall be done to Vashti the queen, who has not done the bidding of Aḥashverosh the king [conveyed] by the officials?” (Esther 1:15).</b><br>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: For a pig,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Vashti.</i> according to the law, and for a holy nation, not according to the law, but with cruelty.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Haman’s later plan to annihilate the Jews was not justified by law.</i> “To Vashti the queen” – all the more so to a queen who is not Vashti.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">According to the midrash, Vashti was from royal stock.

<b>“Memukhan said before the king and the princes: It is not against the king alone that Vashti the queen has sinned; rather, it is against all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of Aḥashverosh the king” (Esther 1:16).</b><br>What did Memukhan see that led him to leap and offer counsel first? [One can learn] from here that the ignorant leap first. Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Ḥilkiya in the name of Rabbi Simon, and Rabbi Elazar, and Rabbi Yoḥanan. One said: Our legal system is like their legal system, and one said: Our legal system is not like their legal system. The one who said our legal system is like their legal system, it is as we learned (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 32a): In monetary laws, and in matters of ritual impurity and purity, one commences from the greatest judge. In capital laws, one commences from the side.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning., the lowest ranking judge.</i> The one who said that our legal system is not like their legal system, what is the significance of “Memukhan said?” [It is comparable to:] The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears to be correct. [Likewise:] The statement of Memukhan appears to be correct.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">There is no indication who spoke first, and the reason only Memukhan’s counsel is mentioned is because his counsel was that which was accepted.</i> <br>Rabbi Yoḥanan said there are three <i>amora’im</i> [who explained why Memukhan sought to depose Vashti]. One said: Because she would slap him with her slippers on this side and that. Another said: Because she did not invite his wife to the women’s banquet. And the other said: Because he had a daughter and he sought to marry her to royalty. The one who said: Because she would slap him with her slippers on this side and that, it is as he said: “It is not against the king alone that Vashti has committed an offense” (Esther 1:16). And the one who said: Because she did not invite his wife to the women’s banquet, it is as he said: “For the queen’s deed will get out to all the women, rendering their husbands contemptible in their eyes” (Esther 1:17); that [indicates that] she was not there. And the one who said: Because he had a daughter and he sought to marry her to royalty, as he said: “And may the king grant her queenship to another who is worthier than she” (Esther 1:19).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This opinion is alluded to by the fact that Memukhan brings up the possibility of a better queen.</i>
<b>“For the queen’s deed will get out to all the women, making their husbands contemptible in their eyes; that King Aḥashverosh said to bring Queen Vashti before him, but she did not come”  (Esther 1:17). </b><br>Rav Shmuel said: Even without this, she needed [to be banished].
<b>“This day, the ladies of Persia and Media, who have heard of the queen’s deed, will tell it to all the king’s princes, and there will be no end [<i>kedaiy</i>] of humiliation and wrath” (Esther 1:18).</b><br>Rav and Shmuel: Rav said: The humiliation is deserving [<i>kedaiy</i>] of this wrath. Shmuel said: The wrath is deserving [<i>kedaiy</i>] of this humiliation. Rabbi Ḥanina said: As her father dishonored the Temple vessels, the humiliation [of Vashti] is deserving of the wrath [that was its result], that was wrathful towards her and killed her.
<b>“If it please the king, let a royal edict be issued before you, and let it be written into the laws of Persia and Media, so that it cannot be abrogated, that Vashti shall never [again] enter the presence of King Aḥashverosh, and may the king grant her queenship to another who is worthier than she” (Esther 1:19).</b><br>He [Memukhan] said to him: ‘My master the king, let the word emerge from your mouth, and I will bring in her head in to you on a platter.’ “And let it be written into the laws of Persia and Media, so that it cannot be abrogated…” – Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Abbahu said: It is written: “For He causes pain and He bandages; He crushes and His hands heal” (Job 5:18). In the language that [announced that] the kingdom was being taken from her [Esther’s] ancestor, as Samuel said to him [Saul]: “And has given it to another, who is worthier than you” (I Samuel 15:28), in the same language, the kingdom was returned to him [to Saul, through his descendant Esther]; that is what is written: “And the king will give her queenship to another who is worthier than she” [that being Esther].
<b>“The king’s decree about what he will do will be heard throughout his entire kingdom, vast as it is, and all wives will give honor to their husbands, from great to small” (Esther 1:20).</b><br>Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yitzḥak, Rabbi Levi said: We are destined to hear a great decree from that one who will become queen. What is that? “There was great mourning among the Jews” (Esther 4:3). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: We are destined to hear a great decree from that one who will become queen. What is that? “There was joy and gladness for the Jews” (Esther 8:17). Rabbi Yehuda son of Rabbi Simon said: The decree of the King of kings will be heard, who said in His wisdom and His understanding: “I will expunge the memory of Amalek” (Exodus 17:14). <br>“Vast as it is” – Rav and Shmuel, one said: This kingdom is too vast for this sin; and one said: This sin is too great for this kingdom.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rav and Shmuel disagree as to whether the word ‘vast’ in the verse refers to the kingdom, or to Vashti’s sin.</i> “And all the wives will give honor to their husbands…”

The way of the world is that if a man wishes to eat lentils and his wife wishes to eat peas, can he compel her? No, she will do whatever she wants.

Chapter 5

Rabbi Azarya began: “Do not see wine in its redness, for one who sets his eye on the cup will walk the straight path” (Proverbs 23:31). Rabbi Azarya said: “Do not see wine in its redness [<i>yitadam</i>]” – as he will lust [<i>yitav</i>] for menstrual blood [<i>dam</i>] and for the blood of discharge [<i>ziva</i>]. “For one who directs his eye to the cup [<i>kos</i>]” – <i>kis</i> is written, a euphemism;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This is a euphemism for licentiousness.</i> that is what you say: “We will have one purse [<i>kis</i>] for all of us” (Proverbs 1:14). “Will walk the straight path”<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash understands this phrase in the verse to be ironic.</i> – ultimately his wife says: I have seen like a red rose, and he does not separate from her. Rabbi Asi said: If he is a Torah scholar, he will ultimately purify the ritually impure, and impurify the ritually pure.<br>Alternatively, “do not see wine in its redness” – it will certainly cause him to flush. “For one who sets his eye on the cup” – he fixes his eyes on the cup and the storekeeper fixes his eye on the purse. “Will walk the straight path [<i>bemeisharim</i>]” – ultimately, he will render his house a plain [<i>meishra</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning it will be empty.</i> He says: Whatever this bronze cup does an earthenware cup does, and he sells it and drinks wine with its proceeds. Whatever this bronze pot does an earthenware pot does, and he sells it and drinks wine with its proceeds. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Raddifa said in the name of Rabbi Ami: Ultimately, he will sell all the vessels in his house and drink wine with [what he gets for] them.<br>Rabbi Aḥa said: There was an incident involving a certain person who sold all the vessels in his house and drank wine with [what he got for] them. His sons said: This father of ours is not leaving us anything. What did they do? They gave him to drink, they lifted him up and carried him, and placed him in a certain cemetery. Some wine merchants passed the gate of the cemetery and heard the <i>angaria</i> [military unit commandeering provisions] was in the city. They unloaded their burden in that cemetery. They said: Let us go and see what is being said in the city. The old man awoke from his slumber and saw a wineskin that had been placed above his head. He untied it and put it in his mouth and drank. He drank until he fell asleep. After three days, his sons said: Should we not go and see how our father is doing? They went and found him and there was a wineskin in his mouth. They said: Here, too, your Creator has not forsaken you. Since you have it from Heaven, we don’t know what we to do with you. They made an arrangement among themselves that each of them [in turn] would provide him with drink on each day.<br>It is written:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">These verses relate to the drinker of wine referred to above, and describe the results of drunkenness.</i> “You will be like one lying in the midst of the sea, like one who lies atop a mast” (Proverbs 23:34). You will be like this ship that is becalmed on the high seas.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Some understand this to mean: “like a ship that is tossed on the high seas.”</i>  “Like one who lies atop a mast,” – like a rooster that sits on a rope and goes constantly to and fro; like a captain who sits atop a mast and goes constantly to and fro.  “They struck me, but I did not feel it” (Proverbs 23:35) – they struck him, but he did not feel. “They beat me, but I did not know” – they exploit him, but he is unaware. He drinks five <i>kustin<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A measure of liquid volume, about a third of a liter.</i></i> of beer and they say to him: ‘You drank ten <i>kustin</i>.’ If you say that he will awaken from his sleep and forget it, Scripture says [about the drunk]: “When will I awaken?

To those who linger over wine”] (Proverbs 23:29-30). “To whom is there woe? To whom alas?” Rav Huna said: To one who does not toil in Torah study. “To whom strife?” – to whom disputes? “To whom talk” – to whom prattle? “To whom wounds without cause” – to whom wounds for nothing? “To those who linger over wine” (Proverbs 23:30).<br>There was an incident involving a certain man who was accustomed to drink twelve <i>kistin </i>of wine every day. One day he drank eleven <i>kistin</i>, and he lay down but sleep would not come. He awoke in the dark and went to the storekeeper. He said to him: ‘Sell me one <i>kista</i>.’ He [the storekeeper] said to him: ‘I will not open for you, because it is dark and I fear the watchmen.’ He directed his eyes and saw a hole in the door. He said to him: ‘Give me from it through the hole, you will position it inside and I will drink it outside.’ He did so for him. He drank and fell asleep before the door. The watchmen passed by him; they thought he was a thief, they struck him and they wounded him. They proclaimed about him: “To whom wounds without cause” – to whom wounds for nothing? “To whom redness of eyes” – to whom eyes red like the sun? <br>All these befall whom? “Those who linger over wine” – this is one who enters the store first and leaves last. “To those who come to assess the mixture” – to one who hears that this [particular] person has fine wine and pursues him. What is written about him at the end? “Its [wine’s] end is that it bites like a serpent and secretes [poison] like an adder” (Proverbs 23:32). Just as this adder separates between death and life, so wine separated between Adam and Eve, as Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: The tree from which Adam the first man ate was a grape [vine]. That is what is written: “Their grapes are grapes of gall, bitter clusters for them” (Deuteronomy 32:32).

Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Levi said: This is comparable to a king who had a loyal member of his household. He found him standing at the entrance of his house, and he decapitated him without saying anything and appointed another member of his household in his stead. We do not know the reason that he killed the first one. It is only from what he commanded the second one and said to him: ‘Do not enter the house’ that we know why he killed the first one. Likewise, “Fire emerged from before the Lord and consumed them” (Leviticus 10:2) – we do not know the reason they died. It is only from what he commanded Aaron and said to him “You shall not drink wine or intoxicating drink” (Leviticus 10:9), that we know that they died only due to the wine.<br>Alternatively, “and secretes like an adder” – just as this adder separates between death and life, so wine separated between the ten tribes and the tribes of Judah and Benjamin for exile. That is what is written: “Woe! Those who rise early in the morning pursue intoxicating drink; those who tarry late, wine will inflame” (Isaiah 5:11), as a result: “Therefore, My people is exiled for lack of knowledge” (Isaiah 5:13).<br>Alternatively, “and secretes like an adder” – just as this adder separates between death and life, so wine separated the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin for exile. That is what is written: “These too erred with wine and strayed with intoxicating drink” (Isaiah 28:7); these and those.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Not only the ten tribes of Israel but also the tribes of Judah and Benjamin were eventually exiled.</i><br>Alternatively, “and secretes like an adder” – just as this adder separates between death and life, so wine separated between kingdom and kingdom for death. That is what is written: “Belshatzar said, as he tasted the wine” (Daniel 5:2), as a result it says: “During that night, Belshatzar the Chaldean king was killed” (Daniel 5:30).<br>Alternatively, “and secretes like an adder” – just as this adder separates between death and life, so wine separated between Aḥashverosh and Vashti for death. That is what is written: “On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine” (Esther 1:10) – as a result he became angry and killed her.

<b>“Have the king appoint officials in all the provinces of his kingdom and they will gather every virgin young woman of fair appearance to the Shushan citadel, to the harem, to the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, guardian of the women, and their cosmetics will be provided.” (Esther 2:3).</b><br>“Have the king appoint officials in all the provinces of his kingdom” – What did he [the king] see? Rabbi Huna said: Because they would demean the daughters of Israel and call them ugly, and that no person would look at them; therefore, they [the women of the kingdom] came into the hands of this purveyor.<br>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Shilka and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When a Jew and a gentile are residing in one courtyard, and the Jew places his pot on the fire and the gentile touches it, it is not ritually impure. If the gentile places his pot on the fire and the Jew touches it, he [the gentile] would say it is impure. Even if several repugnant creatures and creeping animals fall into it, he would eat it, but if a Jew places his food in it, he [the gentile] would break it. So, it is written: “Muster archers against Babylon, all who draw the bow, […repay it in accordance with its actions]” (Jeremiah 50:29). Did it take silver that it will repay silver, gold that it will repay gold? “They ravished women in Zion” (Lamentations 5:11). What does it teach? Rather, so said the Holy One blessed be He: You are eager for licentiousness; by your lives, I will bring upon you a nation that seeks neither silver nor gold from you. That is what is written: “Behold, I will rouse Media against them, who do not appreciate silver and do not desire gold” (Isaiah 13:17). What do they seek from you? “And bows will cleave youths, and they will not have mercy on the fruit of the womb” (Isaiah 13:18).<br>“To the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch [<i>seris</i>], guardian of the women” (Esther 2:3) – he was crushed,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">His testicles were crushed.</i> and was appointed over the virgins. Similarly, “to the custody of Shaashgaz, official [<i>seris</i>] of the king, guardian of the concubines” (Esther 2:14) – he was withered and was appointed over the wives.
<b>“The young woman who will please the king will reign in place of Vashti. The proposal pleased the king and he did so” (Esther 2:4).</b><br>“The young woman who will please the king” – who is fitting for this thing? <sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Fit to raise the woman who would be chosen as queen.</i> Mordekhai – “there was a Jewish man in the Shushan citadel, and his name was Mordekhai” (Esther 2:5).<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This is the immediately following verse. This and the subsequent passages are all cases where the midrash addresses the juxtaposition of two verses. It asks about the first verse: who is fitting for this thing? It then finds the answer in the next verse.</i><br>Similarly, “God saw the children of Israel and God knew” (Exodus 2:25). Who is fitting for this matter? Moses – “And Moses was herding” (Exodus 3:1).<br>Similarly, “Samuel said to the men of Israel: Go, each man to his city” (I Samuel 8:22). Who is fitting for this thing [to be appointed king]? Saul, as it is stated: “There was a man of Benjamin, and his name was Kish…[and he had a son and his name was Saul…]” (I Samuel 9:1–2).<br>Similarly, “Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, and they were dismayed and were greatly afraid.” (I Samuel 17:11). Who is fitting for this thing [fighting Goliath]? David – “David was the son of that Efrati [from Bethlehem]” (I Samuel 17:12).<br>Rabbi Yehoshua bar Aviram said two things. It is written: “He [Yavin king of Canaan] oppressed the children of Israel strongly [<i>beḥozka</i>] for twenty years” (Judges 4:3). What is <i>beḥozka</i>? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: With cursing and blaspheming. That is what is written: “Your words have been harsh against Me” (Malachi 3:13). Who is fitting for this thing? Deborah, as it is written: “Deborah was a prophetess, wife of Lapidot” (Judges 4:4). <br>Rabbi Yehoshua bar Aviram said another: “The people, the princes of Gilad, said one to another: Who is the man who will begin to wage war against the children of Amon? He will be the head of all the inhabitants of Gilad” (Judges 10:18). Who is fitting for this thing? Yiftaḥ – “Yiftaḥ the Giladite was a mighty warrior” (Judges 11:1).

Chapter 6

“Happy are those who observe the law, who act with righteousness at all times” (Psalms 106:3). They were counted<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">They assembled to vote to decide matters of halakha.</i> in the loft of Rabbi Tarfon and said: Who is the one who acts with righteousness at all times? If you say that these are scribes<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Those who teach Bible.</i>  and Mishna teachers; do they not eat, drink, and sleep? Rather, are they writers of phylacteries and <i>mezuzot</i>; do they not eat, drink, and sleep? Rather, who is the one who acts with righteousness at all times? You must say: This one, who raises an orphan in his house.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This is an allusion to Mordekhai, who raised Esther after her parents died.</i> Wouldn’t you say that he doesn’t turn over naked at night?<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">When the orphan who is sleepingturns over and is uncovered, he is not benefiting from the kindness of his foster parent.</i> They said: We still need the <i>moda’i </i>[from Modi’in], as Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i came and taught: The Torah referred only to the slice of bread that he eats in his house.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Since the orphan is sustained by the food he eats in his foster parent’s house, righteousness is being done for him at all times.</i><br>Alternatively, “happy are those who observe the law” – that is Mordekhai; “who act with righteousness at all times” – because he raised an orphan girl in his house. David said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe: “Remember me, Lord, when You favor Your people” (Psalms 106:4) – when You bring salvation for Israel by means of Mordekhai and Esther, when Haman sought to destroy Israel and weighed out ten thousand silver talents by means of the king’s craftsmen, as it is written: “And ten thousand talents of silver…” (Esther 3:9). What is written there? “There was a Judean man in the Shushan citadel, and his name was Mordekhai…” (Esther 2:5).
<b>“There was a Judean man in the Shushan citadel, and his name was Mordekhai, son of Ya'ir, son of Shimi, son of Kish, a Benjamite” (Esther 2:5).</b><br>“There was a Judean man [<i>ish</i>] in the Shushan citadel” –  <i>ish </i> teaches that Mordekhai, in his generation, was the equivalent of Moses, in his generation, as it is written about him: “And the man [<i>veha</i>’<i>ish</i>] Moses was very humble” (Numbers 12:3). Just as Moses stood in the breach, as it is written: “He said He would destroy them, were it not for Moses His chosen one, who stood before Him in the breach…” (Psalms 106:23); also Mordekhai did likewise: “A seeker of good for his people and spokesman of peace for all his descendants” (Esther 10:3).<br>Just as Moses taught Torah to Israel, as it is written: “See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances” (Deuteronomy 4:5), also Mordekhai did so, as it is written: “Matters of peace and truth” (Esther 9:30), and as it is written: “Acquire truth and do not sell” (Proverbs 23:23).<br>“And his name was Mordekhai” (Esther 2:5) – the wicked precede their names: “Naval was his name” (I Samuel 25:25); “Sheva ben Bikhri was his name” (II Samuel 20:21). However, the righteous, their names precede them: “And his name was Manoaḥ” (Judges 13:2); “And his name was Kish” (I Samuel 9:1); “And his name was Elkana” (I Samuel 1:1); “And his name was Boaz” (Ruth 2:1); “And his name was Mordekhai.” It is because they are similar to their Creator, as it is written: “But by My name, the Lord, I was not known by them” (Exodus 6:3).<br>“Judean” – why was he called Judean? Was he not a Benjaminite?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mordekhai is identified as coming from the tribe of Benjamin in Esther 2:5.</i> It is because he unified the name of the Holy One blessed be He<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Actions which assert that there is only one God are referred to as “unifying the name.”</i> before all creatures; that is what is written: “[And Mordekhai] would not bow and would not prostrate himself” (Esther 3:2). Was he contrary and violating the king’s decree? Rather, when Aḥashverosh commanded [everyone] to prostrate themselves to Haman, he [Haman] carved an idol [and set it] over his heart, intending that they prostrate themselves to the idol. <br>When Haman saw that Mordekhai would not prostrate himself to him, he was filled with fury. Mordekhai said to him: ‘There is a Master who exalts over all the exalted; how can I forsake him and prostrate myself to an idol?’ Because he unified the name of the Holy One blessed be He, he is called Judean [<i>Yehudi</i>], meaning by himself [<i>yeḥidi</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Just as God is only one [<i>yeḥidi</i>] so was Mordekhai called <i>yeḥidi.</i></i><br>Some say that he was the equivalent of Abraham in his generation. Just as Abraham allowed himself to be put into the fiery furnace and went about causing people to acknowledge the greatness of the Holy One blessed be He – that is what is written: “And the souls they had gotten in Ḥaran” (Genesis 12:5), so too, Mordekhai, in his time, people acknowledged the greatness of the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “Many of the peoples of the land became Jews, as the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them” (Esther 8:17). He unified the name of the Holy One blessed be He, and sanctified it. Therefore, he is called <i>yehudi</i>, as it is written: “A Judean [<i>yehudi</i>] man” – don’t read it as <i>yehudi</i>, but rather, as <i>yeḥidi</i>.
“Was [<i>haya</i>] [a Judean man in the Shushan citadel]….” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everyone about whom “<i>haya</i>”<i> </i>is stated, it is he at the beginning and it is he at the end.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> He was righteous from beginning to end.</i> They objected to him; but isn’t it written: “One was [<i>haya</i>]  Abraham” (Ezekiel 33:24)?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> Abraham began his life as an idolater; he wasn’t the same at the beginning and the end.</i> He said to them: That is not, in fact, a refutation, as Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: At age three Abraham identified his Creator. That is what is written: “Because [<i>ekev</i>] Abraham heeded My voice” (Genesis 26:5). The number of years that Abraham heeded the voice of his Creator is the equivalent of <i>ekev</i> (172),<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ayin</i> – 70, <i>kof</i> –100, <i>beit</i> – 2</i> and he lived one hundred and seventy-five years. [If one does not accept this explanation,] how do I find expression for <i>haya </i>about him? It means that he was fated from the beginning to guide the entire world to repent.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Although Abraham was not a believer in God his whole life, he had the potential from the beginning.</i><br>“[The Lord God said:] Behold, the man has become [<i>haya</i>] [like one of us, knowing good and evil]” (Genesis 3:22) – he became fated to die. “The serpent was [<i>haya</i>] more cunning” (Genesis 3:1) – he was fated for punishment. “Cain was [<i>haya</i>] a cultivator of the ground” (Genesis 4:2) – he was fated for exile, as you say: “Cain departed from the presence of the Lord” (Genesis 4:16); saying that he would be “restless and wandering” (Genesis 4:12). “There was [<i>haya</i>] a man in the land of Utz” (Job 1:1) – he was fated for suffering. “Noah, a righteous man, was [<i>haya</i>] faultless” (Genesis 6:9) – he was fated to acknowledge his Creator. “Moses was [<i>haya</i>] herding (Exodus 3:1) – he was fated for salvation. Mordekhai was fated for redemption.<br>Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis: Rabbi Levi said: Anyone about whom <i>haya </i>is stated witnessed a new world. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: They are five. <br>Noah – yesterday “Water eroded stone” (Job 14:19), as Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even millstones were dissolved during the flood, and now [after the flood] it says: “The sons of Noah who emerged from the ark…” (Genesis 9:18),<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Immediately following this verse, the Torah relates how the earth was repopulated by Noah’s sons while Noah was alive.</i> indicating that he witnessed a new world.<br>Joseph – yesterday “they tortured [his feet] with chains” (Psalms 105:18), and now “And Joseph was [<i>haya</i>] was the ruler over the land” (Genesis 42:6); that is, he witnessed a new world.<br>Moses – yesterday he was fleeing from Pharaoh and now he is drowning him in the sea; that is, he witnessed a new world.<br>Job – yesterday “He spills my bile onto the ground” (Job 16:13), and now “and the Lord gave Job double what he had had” (Job 42:10); that is, he witnessed a new world.<br>Mordekhai – yesterday “he wore sackcloth and ashes” (Esther 4:1), and now “he emerged from before the king in royal garments” (Esther 8:15). <br>“And his name was Mordekhai” (Esther 2:5). Just as myrrh [<i>mor</i>] is first of all the spices,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">It is first on the list of ingredients of the sacred oil of anointment (Exodus 30:23).</i> so was Mordekhai first among the righteous in his generation.
<b>“Who had been exiled from Jerusalem with the exile that was exiled with Yekhonya king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylonia exiled” (Esther 2:6).</b><br>“Who had been exiled from Jerusalem” – Rabbi Berekhya, and Rabbi Yirmeya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rabbi Yosei said: When Rabbi Yonatan and the Rabbis would reach this verse: “…whom Nebuchadnezzar [king of Babylon] exiled,” they would say: Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed. Why didn’t they say so in the book of Jeremiah? It is only because in every mention of Nebuchadnezzar in Jeremiah, he was alive; here however, he was dead.
“<b>He fostered Hadassa, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother, and the girl was fair and beautiful; and with the death of her father and her mother Mordekhai took her for his own daughter” (Esther 2:7). </b><br>“He fostered Hadassa” – just as myrtle [<i>hadassa</i>] has a sweet fragrance and a bitter taste, so was Esther sweet to Mordekhai and bitter to Haman. “For she had neither father nor mother” – Rabbi Pinḥas and Rabbi Ḥama bar Guryon said in the name of Rav: Was she a girl whose parents are unknown, that you say: “For she had neither father nor mother”? Rather, when her mother conceived, her father died, and when she was born, her mother died.
It is written: “And set it in the ears of Joshua” (Exodus 17:14), this is one of four righteous people to whom a portent was given; two sensed it and two did not sense it. A portent was given to Moses, but he did not sense it. A portent was given to Jacob, but he did not sense it. A portent was given to David and Mordekhai, and they sensed it. <br>Jacob – the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “I will protect you wherever you go” (Genesis 28:15), and he was frightened. A person to whom the Holy One blessed be He made a promise was frightened, as it is written: “He was frightened” (Genesis 32:8)? Rather, he said: Perhaps when I was in the house of Laban the impure, I became sullied with impurity.<br>Moses – “and set it in the ears of Joshua,” indicating that Joshua will lead Israel into the land. And it is written: “I pleaded with the Lord [… please let me cross over and see the good land on the other side of the Jordan]” (Deuteronomy 3:23-25).<br>However, David and Mordekhai were given a portent and they sensed it. David said: “Your servant has smitten both the lion and the bear” (I Samuel 17:36). David said: Am I so important that I was able to smite these wild beasts? Rather, he said: Perhaps an event is destined to befall Israel, and they are destined to be rescued by me.  <br>Mordekhai – “Mordekhai would walk before the courtyard of the harem” (Esther 2:11). He said: Is it possible that this righteous one [Esther] will mary an uncircumcised man? Rather, a great event is destined to befall Israel and they are destined to be rescued by her.
Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One blessed be He said to them, to Israel: You wept and said: “We have become orphans, fatherless” (Lamentations 5:3). By your lives, also the savior that I will establish for you in Media in the future will not have a mother or father. That is what is written: “For she had neither father nor mother.”
<b>“On each day, Mordekhai would walk before the courtyard of the harem, to find out how Esther was, and what would be done with her” (Esther 2:11). </b><br>“On each day, Mordekhai would walk before the courtyard of the harem” – [to give her the opportunity] to ask about her blood stains and her menstrual status.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">According to the midrash, Mordekhai was the head of the Sanhedrin and Esther would ask him halakhic questions about her status as a menstruant.</i> “To find out how Esther was” – that they should not cast any spells of sorcery upon her. Rabbi Yaakov bar Aḥa said: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: You sought to ascertain the wellbeing of one person – “to find out how Esther was”; by your life, ultimately you will seek to ascertain the wellbeing of an entire nation. That is what is written: “Seeking good for his people and speaking of peace for all his descendants” (Esther 10:3).
<b>“With the arrival of the turn of Esther, daughter of Aviḥayil uncle of Mordekhai, who had taken her as his daughter, to go to the king, she did not request anything except that which Hegai, the king's official, guardian of the women, said; and Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her” (Esther 2:15).</b>  <br>“With the arrival of the turn of Esther…Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her” – Rabbi Yuda says: Like that portrait that a thousand people look at and it is beautiful to them all. Rabbi Neḥemya says: They positioned Median women on one side and Persian women on the other side and Esther was more beautiful than them all. The Rabbis said: “And Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone who saw her” – in the eyes of the higher beings [angels] and of the lower [humans]; that is what is written: “And you shall find favor and good grace in the eyes of God and man” (Proverbs 3:4).
<b>“Esther was taken to King Ahashverosh, to his royal palace, in the tenth month, which is the month of Tevet, in the seventh year of his reign” (Esther 2:16). </b><br>“Esther was taken [<i>vatilakaḥ</i>] to King Aḥashverosh” – she was rising in price [<i>likuḥin</i>]; this one said: I will give one hundred dinars to escort her to the king, and that one said: I will give two hundred to escort her to the king.
<b>“The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and grace in his eyes more than all the virgins. He set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen in place of Vashti” (Esther 2:17).</b><br>“The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and grace [more than all the virgins]” –  Rabbi Ḥelbo said: This teaches that they brought even married women before him, therefore it is stated: “More than all the women…more than all the virgins.”<br>“He placed the royal crown on her head, and he made her queen in place of Vashti.” Until they made Esther queen, the portrait of Vashti was still extant; once he married Esther, well born and of noble descent, he said: Take down Vashti and hang up Esther; that is what is written: “And made her queen in place of Vashti.”
<b>“Esther did not disclose her family or her people, as Mordekhai had commanded her; Esther followed Mordekhai’s instructions, as it was when she was fostered by him” (Esther 2:20).</b><br>“Esther did not disclose her family” – teaching that she practiced silence for herself, like her ancestor Rachel, who practiced the craft of silence; all her great descendants maintained silence. Rachel adopted the craft of silence – she saw her betrothal gifts in the possession of her sister and she was silent. Benjamin her son practiced silence – know, as his stone in the breast piece was a chalcedony [<i>yashefe</i>], [i.e.,] he had a mouth [<i>yesh peh</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">He knew that his brothers had sold Joseph.</i> but was silent. Saul, her grandson<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Not literally her grandson, but descendant.</i> – “but the matter of the kingdom…he did not tell him” (I Samuel 10:16). Esther – “Esther did not disclose her family or her people.”
<b>“In those days, Mordekhai was sitting at the king's gate; two of the king's officials, Bigtan and Teresh, among the doorkeepers, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Aḥashverosh” (Esther 2:21).</b><br>“In those days, Mordekhai was sitting at the king's gate; two of the king's officials, Bigtan and Teresh […became angry]” – what was the anger there? He relieved two and set one in their place; he relieved two aristocrats who were the doorkeepers and set that barbarian [in their place].<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">They took Mordekhai to be a barbarian.</i> <br>“Was sitting at the king's gate” – Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: It is written: “Come behold the works of the Lord, who made desolations on the earth” (Psalms 46:9). He incited servants against their master, to bestow greatness upon the righteous; that is what is written: “Bigtan and Teresh became angry…” – to bestow greatness upon Mordekhai. He incited masters against their servants to bestow greatness upon Joseph; that is what is written: “Pharaoh became angry with his servants” (Genesis 41:10).
<b>“The matter was investigated, and it was revealed; the two of them were hanged on a gibbet and it was recorded in the book of chronicles before the king” (Esther 2:23).</b><br>“The matter was investigated, and it was revealed” – Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa bar Shila of the village of Temart said: If in the book [of chronicles] of flesh and blood it is so, when the [the time to read from the] book of the Holy One blessed be He comes, about which it is written: “The Lord listened and heeded and a book of remembrance was written before Him…” (Malachi 3:16), all the more so.

Chapter 7

<b>“After these matters, King Aḥashverosh promoted Haman son of Hamedata the Agagite, and he raised him up and set his seat above all the princes who were with him” (Esther 3:1).</b><br>“After these matters, King Aḥashverosh promoted Haman son of Hamedata” – that is what is written: “But the wicked will perish, and the enemies of the Lord will be like the fat of rams” (Psalms 37:20). They are not fattened for their own good, but for slaughter; so was Haman only made great for his downfall. This is analogous to a person who had a filly, a donkey [the mother of the filly], and a sow. He would feed the sow without limit, and the filly and the donkey measured amounts. The filly said to the donkey: ‘What is this fool doing? We, who perform the owner’s labor, he feeds us measured amounts, and the sow that is idle, without limit.’ She [the donkey] said to her [the filly]: ‘The time will come and you will witness its downfall, as they are not feeding it more for its benefit, but rather, to its detriment.’ When the calends<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The first day of the Roman month, which was often a feast day.</i> arrived, they immediately took the sow and slaughtered it. They began placing barley before the daughter of the donkey, and she blew on it and wouldn’t eat. Her mother said to her: ‘My daughter, it is not the food that causes it, but rather the idleness causes it,’ as it is written: “He set his seat above all the princes who were with him” – therefore, “they hanged Haman” (Esther 7:10).
Another matter: “After these matters” – Rabbi Levi said: What the verse says: “When the wicked sprout like grass, and evildoers flourish” (Psalms 92:8); what is written at the end of the verse: “For their eternal destruction.” Haman was made great only to his harm. Why was he made great? It is analogous to a common soldier who cursed the king’s son. The king said: If I kill him, everyone will say: He killed a common soldier. He appointed him to be an officer, and afterwards, a commander, and then beheaded him. So the Holy one blessed be He said: Had Haman been killed when he went down and counseled Aḥashverosh to cancel construction of the Temple, no one would have known him. Rather, let him be made great and then be hanged. Therefore, “he set his seat above all the princes who were with him,” and then, “they hanged Haman.” The enemies of the Holy one blessed be He are made great for their downfall, and it is written: “He exalts the nations and eliminates them” (Job 12:23).
Another interpretation: “After these matters” – it  is written: “Though his haughtiness ascends to the heavens” – to the heights; “and his head reaches to the clouds”– the clouds<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash explains that the word <i>av</i> in the verse means clouds.</i> (Job 20:6). “He will perish forever, like his dung” (Job 20:7) – just as dung is repulsive, so too, he is repulsive. “Those who see him will say: Where is he?”   (Ibid.) –  They see him but do not recognize him: Where is Haman and where is his contentment?<br>Rabbi Pinḥas related these events: The lion made a banquet for all the animals and spread over them [for shade, the] hides of lions, wolves, and predators. After they ate and drank, they said: ‘If only someone would recite a poem before us.’ They fixed their eyes on a certain fox. He said to them: ‘You repeat to me what I say to you.’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said to them: ‘He who showed us with those above, let him show us with those on the ground.’ So: He who showed us the downfall of Bigtan and Teresh and their hanging will show us the downfall of Haman. And He who punished the first ones, let him punish the latter ones. What is written above on the topic? “The two of them were hanged on a gibbet” (Esther 2:23); so, too, this person will ultimately be hanged.
Another matter: “After these matters, King Aḥashverosh promoted Haman” – there were calculations there. Who calculated? Rabbi Yehuda said: Haman calculated. He said: If Esther is a Jewess, she is my relative via my ancestor Esau; that is what is written: “Isn’t Esau a brother to Jacob” (Malachi 1:2); and if she is a gentile, all gentiles are affiliated with each other.
Rabbi Pinḥas said: Two wealthy men arose in the [history of the] world, one from Israel and one from the idolaters, and their property was only to their harm. Koraḥ in Israel, who found the treasures of gold and silver that Joseph had concealed, and Haman among the idolaters, as he took the treasures of the kings of Judah. When the king saw his wealth, and his ten sons [living] as princes, he arose and promoted and raised him up; that is what is written: “After these matters, King Aḥashverosh promoted Haman son of Hamedata…and he raised him up.”  The king commanded that they should bow and prostrate themselves to him. What did Haman do? He crafted for himself an embroidered image on his garment and on his heart, and anyone who would prostrate himself to Haman would prostrate himself to the image.
<b> “All the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed and prostrated themselves to Haman, for so had the king commanded concerning him; and Mordekhai would not bow and would not prostrate himself” (Esther 3:2).</b><br> “All the king's servants who were at the king's gate.” Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina began: “The arrogant laid a trap for me” (Psalms 140:6) – the congregation of Israel said before the Holy one blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, the idolaters have spread a trap before me to bring me down. They say to me: Engage in idol worship. If I heed them, I will be punished. If I do not heed them, they will kill me. It is analogous to a wolf that thirsted for water, but they spread a net at the entrance to the spring. He said: If I go down to drink, I will be trapped, but if I do not go down, I will die of thirst.
<b>“When they [the king’s servants] spoke to him [Mordekhai] daily and he did not heed them, they told Haman, to see whether Mordekhai’s words would prevail; for he had told to them that he was a Jew” (Esther 3:4). </b><br> “When they spoke to him daily” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Binyamin bar Rabbi Levi: The children of Rachel, their miracles are equal and their ascent to greatness is equal. Their miracles are equal; that is what is written: “It was when she spoke to Joseph day after day” (Genesis 39:10). Here it written: “When they spoke to him daily and he did not heed them,” and there it is written: “And he did not heed her to lie with her, to be with her” (Genesis 39:10). And their ascent to greatness is equal; that is what is written: “Pharaoh removed his ring from his hand and he gave it to Joseph, and he garbed him in garments of linen” (Genesis 41:42). Here it is written: “The king removed the ring that he had taken from Haman, and he gave it to Mordekhai” (Esther 8:2). There it is written: “He had him ride in his second chariot, and they cried before him: ‘<i>Avrekh</i>’”<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning of <i>avrekh</i> is unclear. One opinion, based on the ancient Egyptian, is that it means “pay attention.”</i> (Genesis 41:43); here, it is written: “And let the garments and the horse be placed…and they will proclaim before him: So shall be done to the man whose honoring the king desires” (Esther 6:9).
What did Mordekhai say to someone who would say to him: “Why are you violating the king’s command?” (Esther 3:3) Rabbi Levi said: Mordekhai would say: ‘Moses our master cautioned us in the Torah: “Cursed is the man who will craft an idol or a cast figure” (Deuteronomy 27:15), and this wicked one is rendering himself an idol. And Isaiah the prophet cautioned us: “Desist from man, who has breath in his nostrils, as what is he considered?” (Isaiah 2:22). Moreover, I am of the nobility of the Holy One blessed be He, as all the other tribes were born outside the Land of Israel and my ancestor was born in the Land of Israel.’<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Benjamin was born in Canaan, but all his older brothers were born in Padan Aram when Jacob and his wives were still dwelling with Laban.</i> They said to him: ‘We will tell him.’ Immediately, “they told Haman…” (Esther 3:4).<br>Haman said to them: ‘Tell him: Didn’t his ancestor prostrate himself before my ancestor; that is what is written: “The maidservants approached…and prostrated themselves, and afterward Joseph and Rachel approached and prostrated themselves” (Genesis 33:6–7). He responded: ‘But Benjamin had not yet been born.’ They told him; that is what is written: “They told Haman.”
<b>“Haman saw that Mordekhai was not bowing and prostrating himself to him and Haman was filled with wrath” (Esther 3:5).</b><br>“Haman saw that Mordekhai was not bowing and prostrating himself to him” – Rabbi Aivu said: “May their eyes,” of the wicked, “grow dim so they cannot see” (Psalms 69:24). Because the sight of the eyes of the wicked takes them down to Gehenna; that is what is written: “The children of the great saw the daughters of man”<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The children of the great sinned in doing so. See the following verses.</i> (Genesis 6:2); “Ham, father of Canaan, saw [the nakedness of his father] (Genesis 9:22); “Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were objectionable [in the eyes of Isaac his father]”<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Esau had previously married two women from Canaan.</i> (Genesis 28:8); “Balak son of Tzippor saw [all that Israel had done to the Emorites]”<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">He subsequently hired Bilam to curse them.</i> (Numbers 22:2); “Bilam saw that it was pleasing in the eyes of the Lord to bless Israel,”<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Despite his efforts to curse them.</i> (Numbers 24:1); “Haman saw that Mordekhai was not bowing and prostrating himself to him.”<br>However, the sight of the eyes of the righteous brings light, as the sight of the eyes of the righteous elevates them to the highest heights; that is what is written: “He [Abraham] lifted his eyes and saw, and behold, three men” (Genesis 18:2); “He [Abraham] saw, and behold, a ram” (Genesis 22:13); “He [Jacob] saw, and behold, a well in the field” (Genesis 29:2); “He [Moses] saw, and behold, a bush” (Exodus 3:2); “Pinḥas saw”<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">He saw the Israelites sinning with the daughters of Midyan and arose to put a stop to it.</i> (Numbers 25:7). Therefore, they are happy with the sight of their eyes, as it is stated: “The upright see this and rejoice” (Psalms 107:42).
<b>“It was contemptible in his eyes to lay hands on Mordekhai alone, for they had told him of Mordekhai’s people; Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were in the whole kingdom of Aḥashverosh, the people of Mordekhai” (Esther 3:6).</b><br>“It was contemptible [<i>vayyivez</i>] in his eyes to lay hands on Mordekhai alone” – contemptible one son of contemptible one. It is written there: “Esau showed contempt [<i>vayyivez</i>] to the birthright” (Genesis 25:34), and here it is written: “It was contemptible in his eyes.”<br>“Haman sought to destroy all the Jews” – Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya said: In this world, Israel was likened to rocks, as it is stated: “For from the top of rocks I will see them” (Numbers 23:9); “look to the rock from which you were quarried” (Isaiah 51:1). They were likened to stones, as it is stated: “From the shepherd of the stone of Israel” (Genesis 49:24); “the stone that the builders rejected” (Psalms 118:22). The nations of the world were likened to pottery; that is what is written: “He will break it as a potter’s jug is broken” (Isaiah 30:14). If a boulder falls on a clay pot, woe to the pot; if the pot falls on a boulder, woe to the pot; one way or the other, woe to the pot. So it is regarding anyone who confronts them [the Jews]; he will receive his just deserts from them. And so it says in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream: “That a stone was hewn from the mountain, not with hands, and it crushed the iron, the bronze, the clay”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The stone will destroy the image made of the different materials, each representing an empire that will be destroyed.</i> (Daniel 2:45).<br>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yannai said: If the royal purple is sold in the marketplace, woe to the buyer and woe to the seller. Likewise, Israel is the royal purple in which the Holy One blessed be He glories; that is what is written: “My servant Israel, that I glory in you” (Isaiah 49:3); if they are sold, woe to the seller and woe to the buyer. <br>To what is the wicked Haman comparable? To a bird that made a nest on the seashore and the sea swept away its nest, and it said: ‘I will not move from here until the sea becomes dry land and the dry land becomes sea.’ What did it do? It would take water from the sea in its mouth and pour it on the land, and would take dirt from the land and cast it into the sea. Its fellow came and stood alongside it and said to it: ‘Luckless and unfortunate one! Ultimately, what can you accomplish?’ So said the Holy One blessed be He to the wicked Haman: ‘World class fool! I said I would destroy them, so to speak, and could not, as it is stated: “He said He would destroy them, were it not for Moses, His chosen one, who stood before Him in the breach to turn back His wrath from destruction” (Psalms 106:23), and you said “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13) [them]. By your life, your head will be severed instead of their heads, as they are destined for deliverance and you for hanging.’
<b>“In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Aḥashverosh, he had cast a <i>pur</i>, that is, the lot, before Haman for each day and for each month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar” (Esther 3:7).</b><br>“In the first month, that is, the month Nisan” – it is taught: When the wicked Haman sought to eliminate Israel, he said: ‘How can I gain control over them? I will cast lots.’ The Holy Spirit cried out: “Over My people they cast lots” (Joel 4:3). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one son of wicked one, your lot is drawn to be hanged.’ “He cast a <i>pur</i>, that is [<i>hu</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is claiming that pronoun <i>hu </i>refers to Haman: He cast a <i>pur</i>; upon him was the lot.</i> the lot” – upon him the lot fell. Why? “Indeed, the rod of wickedness will not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous extend their hands for wrongdoing” (Psalms 125:3). <br>First, he cast a lot for the days, as it is stated: “for each day.” He cast the lot on Sunday. Its [Sunday’s] angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The heavens and the earth were created on me [my day], and You said: “truly My covenant is day and night, have I not set the statutes of heaven and earth?” (Jeremiah 33:25). There is a covenant in their flesh, as it is written: “You shall observe My covenant [you and your descendants that are after you for their generations…circumcise for yourselves every male]” (Genesis 17:9–10), and it is written: “My covenant shall be in your flesh” (Genesis 17:13). And there is a covenant in their mouths, that is the Torah, as it is written: “The book of the Torah shall not depart from your mouth” (Joshua 1:8). And You said: “If the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below probed…”( Jeremiah 31:37) and it is written: “[when these laws should ever be annulled before Me, says the Lord,] so too will the descendants of Israel cease from being a nation before Me all the days” (Jeremiah 31:35), and this wicked one seeks to eliminate them? Uproot the heavens and the earth first, and then annihilate them.’<br>He cast the lot on Monday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: On the second day you separated the upper waters from the lower waters, and likewise, Israel is separated from the nations. That is what is written: “I have distinguished you from the peoples to be Mine” (Leviticus 20:26), and this wicked one wants to eliminate them? Overturn the upper and the lower worlds and then annihilate them.’<br>He cast the lot and it fell on Tuesday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The third day – on it, seeds were created, from which Israel separates <i>teruma </i>and tithes, and on it trees were created, with which Israel lauds you. That is what is written: “You shall take for you on the first day: The fruit of a pleasant tree…”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The verse refers to the four species; a palm branch, an etrog, myrtle branches and willow branches, that are taken on Sukkot.</i> (Leviticus 23:40). On it the waters were gathered into the sea [during Creation], and the sea split into twelve segments for Israel’s sake. Now, if Israel is eradicated, how do we exist?’<br>He cast the lot on Wednesday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The fourth day – on it the lights were created to provide light for Israel’s use; that is what is written: “Nations will walk by your light and kings by the aura of your shining” (Isaiah 60:3), and on it the stars were created, and your children were likened to stars; if You eliminate them, how do we exist?’<br>He cast the lot on Thursday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The fifth day – on it were created birds [and animals], from which you commanded to present offerings, and with which You grant atonement to and are reconciled with people; if they are eradicated, who will present an offering?’<br>He cast the lot on Friday. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The sixth day – on it Adam the first man was created, and you called Your children by his name; that is what is written: “You, My flock, flock of My pasture, you are men [<i>Adam</i>]” (Ezekiel 34:31). If you seek to uproot them, uproot all men and then let him [Haman] gain control over them.’<br>He cast the lot on Shabbat. Its angel stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe: The Shabbat day – on it all your creations were completed and perfected; that is what is written: “God completed on the seventh day” (Genesis 2:2), and it is written: “It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever” (Exodus 31:17). If you seek to uproot them, uproot the Shabbat and cancel it; then eliminate them.’<br>Once that wicked one saw that the lot would not fall on the days, he moved to months. <br>He began with the month of Nisan, and the merit of Passover arose. <br>Iyyar had the merit of <i>Pesaḥ sheni</i>,<i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to the fourteenth of Iyyar, when those who had been impure or were too distant from the Temple on the fourteenth of Nisan, could present the Passover offering.</i></i> and the merit of the manna that was provided to Israel on the fifteenth of the month. <br>Sivan had the merit of the Torah. <br>Tammuz had the merit of the land.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The allusion is obscure. It perhaps refers to the fact that Ezra came to the Land of Israel on the first of that month (Ezra 7:8-9). Alternatively, there are midrashic traditions that Joshua stopped the sun in his war with the five Emorite kings during that month (<i>Seder Olam Rabba</i>:11).</i> <br>Furthermore, why didn’t the lot fall on Tammuz and Av? Because they said to the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, the calamities that befell your children in us, five in Tammuz and five in Av, are enough. <br>The possibility of Elul arose – [but it had] the merit of the completion of the wall of Jerusalem that was completed during it. That is what is written: “The wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul” (Nehemiah 6:15). There was also the merit of the animal tithe, as it is taught there: On the first of Elul is the New Year for the animal tithe (Mishna <i>Rosh HaShana</i> 1:1). <br>The possibility of Tishrei arose – [but it had] the merit of the <i>shofar</i>, Yom Kippur, and the festivals.<br>The possibility of Marḥeshvan arose – [but it had] the merit of Sarah our matriarch, who died during it.<br>Kislev – [but it had] the merit of Hanukkah. <br>The possibility of Tevet arose – [but it had] the merit of Ezra. That is what is written: “The exiles did so. Ezra the priest…sequestered themselves; [they convened on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter]...they finished with all the men who had settled with foreign women” (Ezra 10:16–17).<br>The possibility of Shevat arose – [but it had] the merit of the members of the Great Assembly. On the twenty-third of it [the month of Shevat] all Israel gathered over the concubine in Giva (Judges 19–21) and the idol of Mikha (Judges 17–18). <br>The possibility of the first of Adar arose, and no merit was found for it. The wicked one began rejoicing.<br>He then checked the signs of the Zodiac. Lamb [Aries] had the merit of the paschal lamb; that is what is written: “Each man, a lamb for each extended family, a lamb for each household” (Exodus 12:3).<br>Bull [Taurus] – the merit of Joseph, who was called a bull, was found. That is what is written: “A firstborn bull is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17). And the merit of an offering, as it is stated: “A bull, or a sheep, or a goat, when it is born…” (Leviticus 22:27).<br>Twins [Gemini] – the merit of Peretz and Zeraḥ [the sons of Judah], who were called twins, was found in it; that is what is written: “And behold there were twins in her womb” (Genesis 38:27).<br>Lion [Leo] – the merit of Daniel, who was from the tribe of Judah, who was called a lion, [was found in it], as it is stated: “A lion cub is Judah” (Genesis 49:9).<br>Virgin [Virgo] – the merit of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, who were comparable to a virgin with whom no man was familiar other than her husband, [was found in it]; thus they did not change their God and their laws, and clung to their Judaism.<br>Scales [Libra] – that is Job, as it is stated: “If only my anger were weighed” (Job 6:2).<br>Scorpion [Scorpio] – that is Ezekiel, as it is stated: “And you sit among the scorpions” (Ezekiel 2:6).<br>Bow [Sagittarius] – that is Joseph, as it is stated about him: “His bow remained taut” (Genesis 49:24).<br>Kid [Capricorn] – that is Jacob, as it is stated: “And the hides of the kids of the goats” (Genesis 27:16).<br>Bucket [<i>d’li</i>] [Aquarius ] – that is Moses, as it is stated: “And he drew water [<i>dalo dala</i>] for us” (Exodus 2:19).<br>He arrived at the sign of Fish [Pisces], that serves during the month of Adar, and no merit was found for it. He immediately rejoiced and said: ‘Adar has no merit and its Zodiac sign has no merit. Not only that, but Moses their teacher died in Adar.’ And he did not know that Moses died on the seventh of Adar and Moses was born on the seventh of Adar. He said: ‘Just as fish swallow, so, I will swallow them.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one, fish sometimes swallow and sometimes are swallowed. Now, this man will be swallowed by the swallowers.’ Rabbi Ḥanan said: That is what is written: “It was reversed, so that it was the Jews who ruled over their enemies” (Esther 9:1). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: “But the Lord had not determined to expunge [the name of Israel]” (II Kings 14:27); rather, so He spoke: “For I will expunge the memory of Amalek” (Exodus 17:14).
<b>“Haman said to King Aḥashverosh: There is one people that is scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from every people’s, and they do not keep the king’s laws; it is not worthwhile for the king to tolerate them” (Esther 3:8).</b>  <br>“Haman said to King Aḥashverosh: There is [<i>yeshno</i>] one people” – the one of whom it is stated: “The Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4); He is asleep [<i>yashen</i>] for His people. The Holy One blessed be He said to him [Haman]: ‘There is no sleep before Me; that is what is written: “Behold, the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4), and you say that there is sleep before Me? By your life, I will awaken from sleep against that man and eliminate him from the world;’ that is what is written: “Then the Lord awoke as if from sleep…He drove his foes into retreat” (Psalms 78:65–66).<br>Another matter: “There is one people” – he [Haman] said: ‘Their teeth are big, as they eat and drink and say: Delight in Shabbat, delight in the festivals. They cause a decrease in the assets of the world; once every seven days – Shabbat, once every thirty days – the New Moon, in Nisan – Passover, in Sivan – Shavuot,  in Tishrei – Rosh Hashana and the great fast [Yom Kippur], and the festival of Sukkot.’ Aḥashverosh said to him: ‘So they are commanded in their Torah.’ Haman said to him: ‘Had they observed their holidays and our holidays, they would have done well, but they treat your holidays with contempt. “And they do not follow the king’s laws” – as they observe neither calends nor Saturnalia.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Wicked one, you are casting aspersions on their festivals, I will bring you down before them and they will add another festival over your downfall.’ These are the days of Purim; that is what is written: “A fool’s mouth is ruin for him” (Proverbs 18:7).<br>“It is not worthwhile for the king to tolerate them.” For everything that Haman denounced Israel below, [the angel] Michael would advocate for them above. He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe! Your children are being denounced not because they engaged in idol worship, and not for engaging in licentiousness, and not for bloodshed; rather they are being denounced for observing your laws.’ He said to him: ‘I have not, and I will not forsake them.’ That is what is written: “For the Lord will not forsake His people for the sake of His great name” (I Samuel 12:22). Whether they are guilty or innocent, in any case it is impossible to forsake them, because the world cannot exist without Israel.<br>“If a man were to give all the wealth of his house…” (Song of Songs 8:7) – that is Haman the wicked, who gave ten thousand silver talents to obliterate Israel, “…he would be scorned” (Ibid.).
<b>“If it pleases the king, let it be written to eliminate them and I will weigh out ten thousand talents of silver by the hands of the king's craftsmen, to bring to the king's treasuries” (Esther 3:9).</b><br>“If it pleases the king, let it be written to eliminate them.” Reish Lakish said: At the moment that Haman the wicked said to Aḥashverosh: ‘Come let us eliminate Israel from the world,’ Aḥashverosh said to him: ‘You cannot overcome them, because their God does not abandon them at all. Come see what He did to the kings who came before us who extended their hand against them, who were greater and more powerful kings than we are. Anyone who came against them to eliminate them from the world, and those who counseled against them, were eliminated from the world and became a proverb for all residents of the world. We, who are not as great as they were, all the more so. Cease speaking of this matter again.’ Nevertheless, Haman would constantly pester Aḥashverosh over this matter and would counsel him with evil counsel regarding Israel.<br>Aḥashverosh said to him: ‘Since this is the situation, we will consult the wise men and the magicians.’ Immediately, he sent for and assembled all the wise men of the nations of the world. They all came before him. Aḥashverosh said to them: ‘Is it your wish that we eliminate this nation from the world?’ They all said to him simultaneously: ‘“Who is he and where is he, who was so presumptuous to do so?” (Esther 7:5) – to seek to cast [lots] in this matter? For if you eliminate Israel from the world, [know that] the world only exists for the sake of the Torah that was given to Israel. That is what is written: “If it were not for My covenant of day and night, had I not set the statutes of heaven and earth, [I would indeed spurn the descendants of Jacob…]” (Jeremiah 33:25-6).<br>Not only that, but all the idolaters are called strangers before the Holy One blessed be He [and Israel are called [His] intimates]; that is what is written: “Also to the foreigner, who is not of Your people Israel” (I Kings: 8:41). But Israel are called intimates; that is what is written: “For the children of Israel, the people who are intimate with Him” (Psalms 148:14). Not only that, but they are called children; that is what is written: “My firstborn son is Israel” (Exodus 4:22); “You are children to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1). And the Holy One blessed be He is called close to Israel; that is what is written: “The Lord is close to all who call Him sincerely” (Psalms 145:18). There is no nation that is close to the Holy One blessed be He other than Israel, as it is stated: “[For who is a great nation that has God near it] as the Lord our God in all of our calling to Him?” (Deuteronomy 4:7) A person who seeks to extend his hand against the intimates and children of the Holy One blessed be He, how can he escape, as He rules over the upper and the lower worlds, and all living beings. He has the capacity to elevate and to degrade, to put to death and to revive. Go see the previous kings, like Pharaoh and Sennacherib, who transgressed by extending their hand against Israel. What befell them?’<br>Immediately, Haman said to them: ‘The God who drowned Pharaoh in the sea and performed miracles on behalf of Israel, and the mighty acts of which you heard, He is already old and is unable to do anything. Nebuchadnezzar has come and destroyed His Temple and burned His Sanctuary, has exiled Israel and dispersed them among the nations. Where is His power and His might now that He has grown old? As it is stated: “They say: The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not comprehend”’ (Psalms 94:7).<br>Once he said this to them along these lines, they immediately accepted his proposal and they reached a consensus to annihilate Israel, and wrote letters and sealed them. This is what they wrote in those letters: Unlimited peace to you. Let it be known to you that there is a person among us, who is of not from our place, but rather a descendant of royalty, from the descendants of Amalek and one of the great ones of this generation; Haman is his name. He asked us a small simple question about a certain people residing in our midst, most despicable of all the peoples, and they are arrogant. They seek our harm, and cursing the king is common among them. What is the curse that they curse us? “The Lord is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land” (Psalms 10:16), and they also say: “To wreak vengeance on the nations, rebuke among the peoples,” (Psalms 149:7).<br>They repudiate those who have treated them well. Come and see, from that unfortunate, Pharaoh, what did they do? When they went down to Egypt, he received them hospitably, settled them in the finest land in the country, provided for them during the famine years, and fed them all that was best in the land. He had palaces to build, they would build there; nevertheless, he was unable to get them to participate.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">That is, until he ultimately forced them to work.</i> <br>Not only that, but they came to him with a pretext and said to him: ‘In order to sacrifice to the Lord our God, we will go on a three-day journey and we will return afterwards. If you want, lend us silver vessels and gold vessels, and garments.’ They lent them their gold, their silver, and all their fine garments. Each one of them loaded a countless number of their donkeys, until they stripped Egypt; that is what is written: “And they stripped Egypt” (Exodus 12:36), and they fled.<br>When Pharaoh heard that they were fleeing, he followed them to recover his property. What did they do to him? There was a man with them named Moses son of Amram, and with his sorcery he took a staff, uttered an incantation and struck the sea, until it became dry. All of them entered the dry land in the sea and all of them crossed; I don’t know how they crossed, and how the water dried up.<br>When Pharaoh saw this, he entered [the seabed] after them to recover his property. I don’t know what pushed him into the sea. He and his entire army drowned in the sea. They did not remember that he had treated them well. Do you not hear that they are ingrates?<br>Moreover, what did they do to Amalek my grandfather, when he came and waged war against them? It is stated: “Amalek came and waged war with Israel in Refidim” (Exodus 17:8). From where did Amalek come? Rabbi Kruspedai said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: He came from the company of wicked Bilam, as he went to consult with him. He [Amalek] said to him: ‘We know that you are a wise counselor and a purveyor of evil plots, and anyone who receives counsel from you does not fail.’ He [Amalek] said to him: ‘Look what this nation did to Egypt, who had performed many kindnesses to them. If they did so to Egypt, who performed many kindnesses to them, to other nations, all the more so. What do you counsel me?’<br>Bilam said to him: ‘Go and wage war against them, and if you do not wage war against them you will be unable to overcome them, because they can rely on the merit of Abraham their forefather and you are also a descendant of Abraham and can rely on the merit of Abraham.’ They immediately came against them in war.<br>What did that Moses, their leader, do? He had a certain disciple, Joshua son of Nun was his name, and he was extremely cruel and had no mercy. That Moses said to him: “Choose for us men and go out and wage war with Amalek” (Exodus 17:9). I don’t know if those men whom he chose were sorcerers, or whether they were great warriors. What did Moses do? He took a staff in his hand, and I don’t know what he did with it, and when he came against them, I don’t know what incantation he uttered that weakened them and they fell before them; that is what is written: “Joshua weakened Amalek and its people by sword” (Exodus 17:13).<br>They came against Siḥon and Og, the mighty of our land, against whom no creature can prevail, and I don’t know how he killed them. The kings of Midian came against them, and I don’t know how they killed them. Moreover, what did the disciple of that man Moses do? He brought Israel into the land of Canaan, and not only did he take their land, but he killed thirty-one of their kings, and allotted their land to Israel. He had no mercy on them, and those whom he did not seek to kill became their slaves. They came against Sisera and his multitudes and I don’t know what they did to the Kishon Stream that it swept and washed them away and cast them into the Mediterranean Sea, as it is stated: “The Kishon Stream swept them away” (Judges 5:21).<br>They had their first king, Saul was his name, and he went and waged war in the land of my grandfather Amalek, and he killed one hundred thousand of their cavalrymen in one day, and he had no mercy on man, woman, infants and suckling babes, and I do not know how he killed them. In addition, what did he do to my ancestor Agag, upon whom they initially had mercy? Ultimately, a man from them named Samuel came and beheaded him, and left his flesh for the birds of the heavens, as it is written: “Samuel cut Agag into pieces” (I Samuel 15:33), and I do not know why he killed him in this unusual way, as you have heard.<br>After this, they had a certain king named David son of Yishai, who destroyed and eliminated all the kingdoms and had no mercy on them, as it is stated: “David would not leave man or woman alive” (I Samuel 27:11). His son Solomon arose after him and built a certain building for Israel and called it the Temple. I don’t know what they had in it. When they go to war, they enter into it and engage in sorcery there, and when they emerge from it, they kill and destroy the world.<br>And with all the prosperity that they had, they rebelled against their God, and in addition, that God of theirs had grown old. Nebuchadnezzar came and burned that Temple of theirs, exiled them from their land, and brought them into our midst, but they have not yet changed their ugly ways. Even though they are in exile in our midst, they mock us and the faith of our gods. <br>Now we have arrived at a consensus, and have cast lots to eliminate them from the world to determine the time that it will be feasible to annihilate them, and the lot fell on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. Now, when these letters reach you, be prepared for that day, to destroy and kill all the Jews among you, from lad to elder, children and women, on one day, and do not leave from them remnant or refugee.<br>When those letters were sealed and given to Haman, he and all the members of his entourage proceeded joyfully. They met Mordekhai, who was walking ahead of them. Mordekhai saw three children who were coming from school and Mordekhai ran after them. When Haman and his entire entourage saw that Mordekhai was running after the children, they followed Mordekhai to ascertain what Mordekhai would ask them. <br>When Mordekhai reached the children, he asked one of them: ‘Recite your verse to me.’ He said to him: ‘“Fear not from sudden terror, and from the cataclysm of the wicked when it comes”’ (Proverbs 3:25). The second began and said: ‘I read today and with this verse I left school: “Take counsel and it will be negated; speak something and it will not stand, as God is with us”’ (Isaiah 8:10). The third began and said: ‘“Until old age I am He and until gray hairs I will bear you; I have done and I will carry; I will bear and I will rescue”’ (Isaiah 46:4). <br>When Mordekhai heard this, he laughed and was overjoyed. Haman said to him: ‘What is this joy that you rejoiced when hearing the words of these children?’ He said: ‘It is over the good tidings of which they apprised me, that I need not fear the evil designs that you counseled against us.’ Immediately, the wicked Haman became angry and said: ‘I will strike at none other than these children first.’<br>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappḥa said: The wicked Haman came with a great scheme to indict Israel; that is what is written: “Upon the completion of those days, the king made a banquet for all the people who were present in the Shushan citadel” (Esther 1:5). The people mentioned here are none other than Israel; that is what is written: “Happy are you, Israel, who is like you? A people redeemed by the Lord…” (Deuteronomy 33:29). Haman said to Aḥashverosh: ‘The God of these people hated licentiousness. Provide them with prostitutes, make a banquet for them, and decree that they must all attend and eat and drink and do as they please,’ as it is stated: “To act in accordance with the wishes of each man” (Esther 1:8).<br>When Mordekhai saw this, he arose and proclaimed, saying to them: ‘Do not go to eat at the banquet of Aḥashverosh, who invited you only to prosecute you, so there will be a basis for the attribute of justice to prosecute you before the Holy One blessed be He.’ They did not heed the words of Mordekhai, and they all went to the banquet house.<br>Rabbi Yishmael said: Eighteen thousand five hundred went to the banquet house and ate, drank, became intoxicated, and were corrupted. Immediately, the Accuser arose and informed on them before the Holy One blessed be He and said before Him: ‘Master of the universe! How long will you cleave to this nation, who remove their heart and their trust from you? If you will, eliminate this nation from the world because they are not repenting before you.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘What will become of the Torah?’ He said to Him: ‘Master of the universe! It will be satisfied with those above.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah will be learned by the angels.</i> He also resolved to eradicate Israel. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Why do I need a nation for which I made many of my signs and wonders against all who rose against them to harm them? “I would terminate their memory from man”’ (Deuteronomy 32:26).<br>Immediately, the Holy One blessed be He said to the Accuser, ‘bring Me a scroll, and I will write eradication on it.’ At that moment, the Accuser went and brought Him a scroll and He wrote on it. Immediately, the Torah emerged in widow’s garb and raised its voice in weeping before the Holy One blessed be He, and the ministering angels screamed in response to its weeping. They said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, if Israel is abolished from the world, what need is there for us in the world, as it is stated: “Behold, their angels cry out outside, the messengers of peace weep bitterly”’ (Isaiah 33:7). When the sun and the moon heard this, they withheld their light, as it is stated: “I will garb the heavens with blackness and make sackcloth their garment” (Isaiah 50:3).  <br>At that moment, Eliyahu of blessed memory ran in a panic to the eternal patriarchs, and to Moses son of Amram, and said to them: ‘How long will the patriarchs of the world remain dormant in sleep, and not pay attention to the trouble which your descendants are undergoing, over which the ministering angels, the sun, the moon, the stars, the constellations, the heavens, the earth, and all the hosts of the heavens are weeping bitterly, and you are standing by, and not paying attention?’ They said to him: ‘Why?’ He said to them: ‘Because they derived benefit from the banquet of Aḥashverosh. Because of that, a decree was issued against them to eliminate them from this world and to expunge their memory.’<br>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob said to him: ‘If they violated the laws of the Holy One blessed be He and their decree was sealed, what can we do?’ Eliyahu then said to Moses: ‘Loyal shepherd, how many times have you stood in the breach on Israel’s behalf, and you cancelled the decree so He would not destroy, as it is stated: “Were it not for Moses, His chosen one, who stood before Him in the breach to turn back His wrath from destruction” (Psalms 106:23). How will you respond to this trouble, “for the children have come to the birth stool, [but there is no strength to give birth]”?’ (Isaiah 37:3).<br>Moses said to him: ‘Is there an honest person in this generation?’ He said to him: ‘There is, and his name is Mordekhai.’ He said to him: ‘Go and let him know, so that he will stand in prayer there, and I will do so from here, and we will ask for mercy for them before the Holy One blessed be He.’ He [Eliyahu] said to him: ‘Loyal shepherd, the letter of annihilation of Israel has already been written.’ Moses said to him: ‘If it is sealed in mortar, our prayer will be heard, but if it is sealed in blood, what was [decreed] will be.’ He said to him: ‘It is sealed with mortar.’ Moses said to him: ‘Go and let Mordekhai know.’ He immediately went and let Mordekhai know; that is what is written: “Mordekhai knew everything that had been done, and Mordekhai rent his garments” (Esther 4:1). When they told Esther, immediately, “the queen was greatly agitated” (Esther 4:4). What is the meaning of agitated? It teaches that she began menstruating.





Another matter: “If it pleases the king, let it be written to eliminate them” (Esther 3:9) – He [Haman] said to him [the king]: ‘You should write to give me the pen,’<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Give me license to send letters in your name.</i> and he said: ‘“I will weigh out ten thousand talents of silver by the hands of the king's craftsmen”’ (Ibid.).<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">I will submit payment even before the letter is written and the decree is fulfilled.</i> Haman said to him: ‘At present, I do not know their number. When they left Egypt, they were six hundred thousand men, and for each of them I will give you one hundred <i>zuz</i>, which equals fifty shekels.’<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Haman offered Aḥashverosh ten thousand silver talents. Each talent is the equivalent of sixty <i>maneh</i>, which is the equivalent of one hundred <i>zuz</i>.</i>
<b>“The king removed his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, son of Hamedata the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews” (Esther 3:10).</b><br>“The king removed his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman.” The Rabbis say: Aḥashverosh hated Israel more than Haman the wicked. The way of the world is that the buyer typically gives collateral to the seller; here, however, the seller gave the collateral; that is what is written: “The king removed his ring from his hand and gave it to Haman.”
<b>“The king said to Haman: The silver is given to you, and the people are yours to do with them as you see fit” (Esther 3:11).</b><br>“The king said to Haman: The silver [<i>hakesef</i>] is given to you” – The numerical value of <i>hakesef</i> is one hundred and sixty-five,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Heh</i> – 5, <i>kaf</i> – 20, <i>samekh</i> – 60, <i>peh </i>– 80</i> the equivalent of the gibbet [<i>haetz</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Heh </i>– 5, <i>ayin </i>–70, <i>tzadi</i> – 90</i> the total of one is equal to the total of the other.
<b>“The king’s scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written in accordance with everything that Haman had commanded the king’s satraps, and the governors who were over every province, and the princes of every people; to every province in its script, and to every people in its language. It was written in the name of King Aḥashverosh, and it was sealed with the king's ring” (Esther 3:12).</b><br>“The king’s scribes were summoned...and it was written in accordance with everything that Haman had commanded.” It is written: “Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying: Every son who is born, you shall cast him into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22). Pharaoh commanded, but the Holy One blessed be He did not command. You [Haman], what power do you have? “Who is this, who said and it occurred, if the Lord did not command?” (Lamentations 3:37). What did He command? “For with a powerful hand he will send them out” (Exodus 6:1); and so it happened to him. Moreover, “He tossed Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:15).<br>Similarly, “in accordance with everything that Haman had commanded” – he commanded, but the Holy One blessed be He did not command. Haman commanded “to destroy, to kill and to eliminate” (3:13), but the Lord did not command. What did He command? “May his evil plot that he had devised against the Jews return upon his head” (Esther 9:25), and so it happened to him, “and they hanged him and his sons on the gibbet” (Ibid.).<br>It is written: “He who elevates his entrance seeks destruction” (Proverbs 17:19). One who elevates the pronouncements of his mouth and utters inappropriate matters from his mouth, the Holy One blessed be He breaks him, and in the pot in which he cooked, he is cooked. Likewise, with Yitro it says: “As it was in the matter that they conspired against them” (Exodus 18:11).
Rabbi Levi said: Accursed are the wicked who are engaged in evil counsel against Israel, and each one of them counsels in his way and says: ‘My counsel is better than your counsel.’ <br>Esau said: ‘Cain was a fool because he killed his brother during his father’s lifetime, and he didn’t know that his father would procreate. I will not do so; rather: “Let the days of mourning my father approach, and I will kill my brother Jacob”’ (Genesis 27: 41). <br>Pharaoh said: ‘Esau was a fool. Did he not know that his brother would procreate during his father’s lifetime? I will not do so [delay before killing Israel]. Rather, while they are still small and just out of their mother’s womb, I will suffocate them’; that is what is written: “Every son who is born, you shall cast him into the Nile” (Exodus 1:22).<br>Haman said: ‘Pharaoh was a fool, as he said: “Every son who is born, you shall cast him into the Nile.” Didn’t he know that girls marry and procreate? I will not do so; rather, “to destroy, to kill and to eliminate…” (Esther 3:13).’<br>[Haman continued:] ‘Even Gog and Magog<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Gog is the prophesied king of Magog in the war that will take place at the end of days. See Ezekiel 38–39.</i> in the future are destined to say: “Those who preceded me were fools, as they engaged in counsel with their kings against Israel, but they did not know that they have a patron in Heaven.” I will not do so. I will confront their patron first, and then I will confront them.’ That is what is written: “The kings of the earth have assembled, and rulers are gathered together against the Lord and against His anointed” (Psalms 2:2). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Wicked one, do you come to confront Me? How many divisions are before Me? How many lightning bolts? How many thunder claps? It is like what is written: “The Lord thundered with a great sound” (I Samuel 7:10); and how many seraphs and how many angels? rather, My power will emerge and wage war with you; that is what is written: “The Lord will emerge and wage war against those nations, like the day that He waged war on the day of battle” (Zechariah 14:3); “The Lord will emerge like the valiant one, He will arouse zealotry like a man of war…” (Isaiah 42:13); “The Lord will be King over the entire earth” (Zechariah 14:9).
<b>“The text of the document was that an edict be issued in every province, to be publicly displayed to all the peoples: Be ready for that day” (Esther 3:14). </b><br>“The text of the document” – an exact copy of the document. That an edict be issued in every province, to be publicly displayed to all the peoples: Be ready for that day.” Rabbi Levi said: The prophecy of the nations of the world is obscure, and they do not know whether it [the edict] is to be killed or to kill. This is analogous to a person who was walking along the way, and from the rigor of the way he sprained his ankle. He said: ‘If only I had a donkey.’ A Roman whose donkey had just given birth to a foal passed by him and said to him: ‘Take this foal and carry it on your shoulders.’ He said: ‘My prayer was answered, but I didn’t ask appropriately, whether it was to ride or to be ridden by.’ So is the prophecy of the nations of the world: “Be ready for that day,” but they do not know whether it is [for them] to kill or to be killed. For Israel, however, their prophecy is explicit: “For the Jews to be ready for that day, to take vengeance against their enemies” (Esther 8:13).
<b>“The couriers went out urgently by the king’s command, and the order was issued in the Shushan citadel; the king and Haman sat to drink, and the city of Shushan was confounded” (Esther 3:15).</b><br>“The couriers went out urgently by the king’s command… the king and Haman sat to drink.” Rabbi Ḥanin said: Anyone who says that the All-Merciful is forbearing, his innards will be forborne. Rather, He withholds His anger, but [later] collects His due. He said to the tribes: ‘You sold your brother while eating and drinking.

Chapter 8

<b>“Mordekhai knew everything that had been done, and Mordekhai rent his garments and donned sackcloth and ashes. He went out in the midst of the city and cried a loud and bitter cry” (Esther 4:1). </b><br>“Mordekhai knew everything that had been done, and Mordekhai rent his garments.” Benjamin caused the tribes [his brothers] to rend; that is what is written: “They rent their garments” (Genesis 44:13). Where was he caused to rend? It was in Shushan the citadel; that is what is written: “Mordekhai rent his garments,” and he was from the tribe of Benjamin.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash is stating that the fact that Mordekhai had to rend his garments is in some respects a punishment for Binyamin having caused his brothers to have to rend their garments. This is because he was not careful enough and did not notice that the silver goblet had been placed in his sack (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i><br>“He donned sackcloth and ashes.” Rabbi Aivu said: Once Jacob our patriarch adopted sackcloth, as it is written: “He placed sackcloth on his loins” (Genesis 37:34), it never again left his descendants. It is written about Ahab: “He placed sackcloth on his flesh” (I Kings 21:27); his son Yoram: “The people saw, and behold, the sackcloth was on his flesh” (II Kings 6:30); Mordekhai, “He donned sackcloth and ashes.”<br>“He [Esau] cried a loud and bitter cry” (Genesis 27:34). Where was he repaid? In Shushan, as it is stated: “[Mordekhai] cried a loud and bitter cry.” Rabbi Ḥanin said: Anyone who says that the All-Merciful is One who forgoes, his innards will be forgone. He is forbearing, but then collects His due. Know that Jacob caused Esau to cry one cry, as it is written: “He cried a loud and bitter cry” [and as a result, Jacob’s descendant, Mordekhai, cried a loud and bitter cry].
<b>“And in each and every province, any place where the word of the king and his decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews” (Esther 4:3).</b><br>Is there great mourning and minor mourning? Rather, the way of the world is that all mourners, their mourning gradually diminishes during the seven days [of mourning]. It is greatest on the first day, and the more it progresses it weakens, until twelve months [have passed]. However, in this case of Haman it continuously intensified, as with each day that passed they would say: One day of [the short time we have left in] our lives is already gone.<br>Alternatively: A standard mourner, when his son dies, the comforters say to him: May your remaining son live. If he did not have another, they say to him: Live long. But here, everyone is being taken to die, “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate.”
<b>“Esther’s young women and her chamberlains came and told her, and the queen was greatly shocked” (Esther 4:4).</b><br>The Rabbis from there<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">From Babylonia.</i> say: She menstruated. The Rabbis from here<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">From the Land of Israel.</i> say: She miscarried her fetus, and once she miscarried, she never gave birth again. Rabbi Yudan son of Rabbi Simon said: With an absorbent cloth<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">This was a form of birth control.</i> she would engage in relations. Rabbi Yudan son of Rabbi Simon said: The last Darius was the son of Esther; he was pure from his mother’s side and impure from his father’s side.
<b>“Esther summoned Hatakh, one of the king’s chamberlains whom he had set before her, and commanded him to go to Mordekhai to know what this is and why this is” (Esther 4:5).</b><br>“Esther summoned Hatakh” – The Rabbis from there say: Hatakh is Daniel; because they demoted him [<i>ḥatakhuhu</i>] from his prominence<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Daniel was a high ranking advisor in the Babylonian government.</i> he was called Hatakh, [similar to] <i>ḥatakh</i>. The Rabbis from here say: [He was called Hatakh] because he decided [<i>ḥatakh</i>] matters [of state].<br>“To know what this is [<i>ma zeh</i>], and why this is [<i>ma zeh</i>]” (Esther 4:5). She said to him: ‘Go and say to him: In all the days of Israel they never encountered trouble like this. Perhaps Israel has denied “this [<i>zeh</i>] is my God and I exalt Him” (Exodus 15:2), or perhaps they denied the tablets, in whose regard it is written: “From this side [<i>mizeh</i>] and from that side [<i>umizeh</i>] they were inscribed”’ (Exodus 32:15).
“Mordekhai told him everything that had befallen him [<i>karahu</i>]” (Esther 4:7). He said to Hatakh: ‘Tell her that the descendant of <i>karahu<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Amalek, the subject of the verse in Deuteronomy 25:18.</i> </i>has come against you; that is what is written: “That he encountered you [<i>kareḥa</i>] on the way”’ (Deuteronomy 25:18).<br>Alternatively, “that had befallen him” in a dream, indicating that he reminded her of a dream that he had dreamed along these lines during the second year of the reign of Aḥashverosh. He saw, and behold, a great and powerful earthquake, panic in the world, and fear and trembling for all its residents. And behold, two great serpents each bellowing toward the other and they waged a war, and all the nations of the world fled due to their noise. There was among them a certain small nation, and all the nations attacked the small nation to eliminate any memory of it from the earth. On that day there was darkness for the entire world, and that small nation was very distressed and they cried to God. The serpents were waging war furiously and there was no one to separate between them. <br>Mordekhai saw, and behold, there was a certain spring of water that passed between these serpents and it separated between them, preventing the war they had been waging. The spring swelled and became a raging stream, like the flow of the Mediterranean Sea, that gradually inundated the land. He saw and the sun shone for the entire land and the world was illuminated. The small nation was elevated, the dominant were lowered, and peace and truth were found throughout the land.  <br>It was from that day forward, Mordekhai kept that dream that he had dreamt, and when Haman was causing him distress, he said to her [Esther] by means of her emissary: ‘This is the dream that I told you in your youth. Now, arise and ask for mercy from the Holy One blessed be He, and come before the king and entreat him on behalf of your people and your family.’
<b>“For if you are silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, and you and your father’s house will perish; who knows if it was for a time like this that you attained royalty?” (Esther 4:14). </b><br>“For if you are silent” – if you [Esther] are silent now and refrain from advocating on behalf of your nation, ultimately you will be silent in the future and you will have no claim. Why? Because you have the opportunity to perform good during your life and you [will have] failed to do so. What, do you think that the Holy One blessed be He will abandon Israel? In any case, he will provide them with a redeemer; that is what is written: “Relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place.”
“Esther said, to respond to Mordekhai” (Esther 4:15). She said to him: “Go, assemble all the Jews who are present in Shushan, and fast on my behalf; do not eat and do not drink for three days” (Esther 4:16). These were the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth of Nisan. He sent her [in response]: ‘But isn’t the first day of Passover among them?’ She said to him: ‘Elder of Israel, why is it Passover?’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The festival of Passover was given to the Jewish people; if they are destroyed, of what value is the festival of Passover? It is better to desecrate Passover once so that it may be observed forever more (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> Immediately Mordekhai heard and conceded to her contention; that is what is written: “Mordekhai went on [<i>vaya’avor</i>] and acted in accordance with everything that Esther had commanded him” (Esther 4:17). There they say: That he violated [<i>shehe’evir</i>] the first day of Passover<i> </i>with a fast.<br>Regarding that same trouble, Mordekhai prayed to God and he said: ‘It is revealed and known before Your Throne of Honor, Master of the universe, that it is not due to haughtiness or arrogance that I did not prostrate myself to Haman; rather, it is due to my fear of You that I acted in this way, and did not prostrate myself to him. It is because I feared You, and did not wish to grant the honor due to You, to flesh and blood, and I did not want to prostrate myself to anyone other than You. For who am I not to prostrate myself to Haman at the expense of the salvation of Your people Israel? For that, I would be prepared to lick the shoes on his feet.<br>Now, God, rescue us from his hand, and let him fall into the grave that he dug, and let him be ensnared in the net that he concealed at the feet of your pious ones. And let this instigator know that You have not forgotten the promise that You promised us: “And despite this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not have spurned them and will not have rejected them, to destroy them, to violate My covenant with them, as I am the Lord their God”’ (Leviticus 26:44). <br>What did Mordekhai do? He assembled the children and deprived them of bread and water, he dressed them in sackcloth and sat them in ashes. They were shouting, weeping, and engaging in Torah study.<br>At that time, Esther was very frightened due to the evil that had developed for Israel. She removed her royal garments and her glory, donned sackcloth, loosened her hair and filled it with dirt and ashes, afflicted herself in a fast, and fell on her face before God and prayed. She said: ‘Lord, God of Israel, who has ruled since the days of yore and created the world, please help your maidservant, as I have remained an orphan from my father and my mother, and am comparable to a poor woman begging from house to house. So, I am requesting Your mercy from window to window in the palace of Aḥashverosh.<br>Now, Lord, please grant success to this poor maidservant of yours, and deliver the sheep of Your flock from these enemies who have arisen against us, as You have “no restraint to save by many or by few” (I Samuel 14:6). You, father of orphans, please stand to the right of this orphan, who has relied on your mercy, and let me be viewed mercifully by this man, for I fear him. Lower him before me because You lower the haughty.’

Chapter 9

<b>“It was on the third day, Esther donned royalty and stood in the inner court of the king’s palace, facing the king’s palace, while the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room facing the entrance of the palace” (Esther 5:1).</b><br>“It was on the third day, Esther donned” – the garments of her beauty and the jewels of her glory. She took her two young women with her; she placed her right hand on one young woman and leaned on her in accordance with the royal custom, and the second young woman walked behind her mistress supporting her jewels, so that the gold would not touch the ground. She put on a joyful face, masked the worry in her heart, and came to the inner courtyard facing the king, and she stood before him.<br>The king was sitting on his royal throne in garments of gold and jewels. He lifted his eyes and saw Esther standing before him, and his wrath was greatly enflamed because she had violated his protocol and she came before him without being summoned. Esther lifted her eyes and saw the king’s face, and his eyes were like fire, blazing from the great fury in his heart.<br>Esther recognized the king’s anger and she was greatly panicked, and her spirit grew faint. She placed her head on the young woman supporting her on the right. Our God saw and took pity on His people, recognized the suffering of the orphan who had placed her trust in Him, invested her with grace before the king, and added beauty to her beauty and magnificence to her magnificence. The king rose from his throne in a frenzy, ran to Esther, hugged and kissed her, and placed his arm around her neck. The king said to her: ‘Queen Esther, why are you afraid? This protocol that we instituted is not incumbent upon you, as you are my beloved and my companion.’ He said to her: ‘Why, when I saw you, did you not speak to me?’ Esther said: ‘My lord the king, when I saw you, my soul was startled due to your greatness.’
“The king said to her: What troubles you, Queen Esther, and what is your request… Esther said: If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet… The king said: Hasten Haman…The king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared…Haman emerged on that day joyful and glad of heart, but upon Haman’s seeing Mordekhai at the king’s gate, and he did not stand, and he did not move on his account, Haman became filled with fury…Haman restrained himself…and brought his supporters and Zeresh his wife, etc.” (Esther 5:3–5; 8–10). <br>Among all of them, there was no one capable of giving counsel like Zeresh his wife. He [Haman] had three hundred and sixty-five advisers, corresponding to the days of the solar year. His wife said to him: The person [Mordekhai] about whom you are asking, “If he is of the progeny of the Jews…you will not prevail against him” (Esther 6:13) – unless you approach him with cleverness, with [a strategy] that has never been attempted against members of his nation. If you drop him into a fiery furnace, Ḥananya and his cohorts have already been rescued [from it]; if [you place him in] the lions’ den, Daniel already emerged from it. If you incarcerate him in prison, Joseph already emerged from it. If you ignite a fire in a vat beneath him, Menashe [king of Judah] already pleaded, and the Holy One blessed be He acceded to his plea and he emerged from it. If you exile him to the wilderness, his ancestors already procreated in the wilderness, and they were confronted with numerous ordeals and passed them all and were rescued. If you blind his eyes, Samson took numerous Philistine lives when he was blind. Rather, hang him on a gibbet, as no member of his people has survived it.<br>Immediately, “the matter was pleasing to Haman and he prepared the gibbet” (Esther 5:14). From what tree was that gibbet crafted? The Rabbis said: When he came to prepare it, the Holy One blessed be He called to all the trees of Creation: ‘Who will give [of its wood] so this wicked one [Haman] will be hanged on it?’ <br>The fig said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel brings first fruits from me. Moreover, Israel was likened to the first fruits [of a fig]; that is what is written: “Like a first fruit on a fig tree in its first season”’ (Hosea 9:10).<br>The grapevine said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; that is what is written: “You transported a vine from Egypt”’ (Psalms 80:9).<br>The pomegranate said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; as it is stated: “Your temple is like a pomegranate slice”’ (Song of Songs 4:3).<br>The nut said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was likened to me; that is what is written: “I have descended to the nut garden”’ (Song of Songs 6:11).<br>The citron said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel takes from me for a mitzva; that is what is written: “You shall take for you on the first day the fruit of a pleasant tree…”’<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This verse refers to the mitzva to take the four species on <i>Sukkot</i>. Rabbinic tradition identifies the “pleasant tree” as the citron.</i> (Leviticus 23:40).<br>The myrtle said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; as it is stated: “And he was standing among the myrtles”’ (Zechariah 1:8).<br>The olive said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; as it is stated: “The Lord called your name a flourishing olive-tree, fair of fruit and form”’ (Jeremiah 11:16).<br>The apple said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; as it is stated: “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the boys” (Song of Songs 2:3), and as it is written: “And the fragrance of your face like apples”’ (Song of Songs 7:9).<br>The palm said: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me; that is what is written: “This, your stature, is likened to a palm”’ (Song of Songs 7:8).<br>Acacia trees and cypress trees said: ‘We will give of ourselves, as the Sanctuary was crafted and the Temple was constructed from us.’<br>The cedar and the date said: ‘We will give of ourselves, as we are analogized to the righteous, as it is stated: “The righteous man flourishes like a palm tree; like a cedar in Lebanon he grows tall”’ (Psalms 92:13).<br>The willow says: ‘I will give of myself, as Israel was analogized to me, as it is stated: “Like willows by streams of water” (Isaiah 44:4); and they take from me for the mitzva of the four species in the <i>lulav</i>.’<br>At that moment, the thorn said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, I, who have nothing to ascribe [<i>litlot</i>] to myself, I will give of myself, and that impure one will be hanged [<i>veyitaleh</i>]. My name is thorn, and he [Haman] is a painful thorn; it is appropriate for a thorn to be hanged on a thorn.’ They found [suitable wood from a thorn] and erected [the gibbet].<br>When they brought it before Haman, he prepared it at the entrance to his house and measured himself on it to show his servants how Mordekhai should be hanged on it. A divine voice replied to him: ‘The tree is suitable for you; this tree has been prepared for you since the six days of Creation.’ The Rabbis there [i.e. Babylonia] say: Where in the Torah is there [an allusion] to Haman? It is, as it is stated: “Was it from the tree [<i>hamin haetz</i>]” (Genesis 3:11), which is expounded to read: Haman <i>haetz</i>.<br>Another matter: “it was on the third day” (Esther 5:1). Israel is never subject to trouble for more than three days, as in Abraham’s regard it is written: “On the third day, Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from a distance” (Genesis 22:4). The tribes, “he gathered them into custody for three days” (Genesis 42:17). Jonah, as it is stated: “Jonah was in the innards of the fish three days and three nights” (Jonah 2:1). And the dead will live only after three days, as it is stated: “On the third day He will raise us” (Hosea 6:2).<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">At the resurrection of the dead, all will be revived for the day of judgement, when some will be granted “eternal life,” and others will receive “reproaches and everlasting abhorrence” (Daniel 12:2). The midrash here is stating that the righteous will experience the anxiety of the impending judgement for three days before they are granted eternal life.</i> This miracle, too, transpired after three days of their fasting; that is what is written: “It was on the third day, that Esther donned royalty” (Esther 5:1). She sent and invited Haman to a banquet with the king on the fifteenth of Nisan. Once they ate and drank, Haman said: ‘The king promotes me, his wife honors me, and there is no one in the kingdom greater than I am,’ and his heart was overjoyed; that is what is written: “Haman emerged on that day joyful and glad of heart” (Esther 5:9).
<b>“Haman said: ‘Indeed, Queen Esther gave a feast and besides the king she did not bring anyone but me. And tomorrow too I am invited by her along with the king” (Esther 5:12).</b><br>“Haman said: Indeed [<i>af</i>], Queen Esther…did not bring anyone.” Four began with <i>af</i> and were eliminated with <i>af</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">One of the meanings of the word <i>af</i> is anger. The midrash is saying that these four individuals or groups, who used the word <i>af</i>, were eliminated by divine anger due to their sins.</i> and they are: The snake, the baker, the congregation of Koraḥ, and Haman. The snake, as it is written: “Did God actually [<i>af</i>] say” (Genesis 3:1); the baker, as it is written: “I, too [<i>af</i>], in my dream” (Genesis 40:16); the congregation of Koraḥ, as it is written: “Yet [<i>af</i>] [you did not take us] to a land flowing with milk and honey” (Numbers 16:14); Haman, as it is written: “Indeed [<i>af</i>], Queen Esther did not bring anyone.”
After he erected the gibbet, he went to Mordekhai and found that he was sitting in the study hall with the children sitting before him, with sackcloth on their waists, engaging in the study of Torah, and they were screaming and weeping. He counted them and found there twenty-two thousand children. He cast iron chains on them and deployed guards over them. He said: ‘Tomorrow, I will kill these children first and then I will hang Mordekhai.’ Their mothers were bringing them food and water and saying to them: ‘Our children, eat and drink before you die and don’t die hungry.’ Immediately, they placed their hands on their books and took an oath: ‘By the life of Mordekhai our master, we will not eat and drink, but will die while fasting.’ All of them began weeping loudly until their cries reached the heavens. The Holy One blessed be He heard the sound of their weeping approximately two hours into the night.<br>At that moment, the compassion of the Holy One blessed be He was aroused, and He stood up from His throne of justice and sat down on His throne of mercy, and said: ‘What is that loud sound I hear that sounds like goats and lambs?’ Moses our master stood before the Holy One blessed be He and said: ‘Master of the universe, they are neither goats nor lambs, but rather the children of Your people, who are fasting today [and have already been fasting for] three days and three nights, and tomorrow their enemy seeks to slaughter them like goats and lambs.’ At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He took those letters that He had decreed against them that were sealed with mortar seals and He ripped them.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">See Esther Rabba 7:14.  </i> He brought fear upon Aḥashverosh that night; that is what is written: “On that night [sleep deserted the king, and he ordered the book of records, the annals to be brought; and it was read to the king] (Esther 6:1).

Chapter 10

<b>“That night, the king’s sleep was disturbed; he said to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king” (Esther 6:1).</b><br> “That night, the king’s sleep was disturbed” – The heavens disturbed the throne of the king of kings, the Holy one blessed be He, who saw Israel in distress.  Does the Omnipresent sleep? Does it not already say: “Behold, the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps” (Psalms 121:4)? Rather, at a time when Israel is immersed in trouble and the nations of the world are at peace [it is said allegorically that God is sleeping, and] for this [reason] it says: “Rouse Yourself; why do You sleep, O Lord?” (Psalms 44:24). <br>King Aḥashverosh’s sleep was disturbed as he saw in his dream that Haman took a sword to kill him; he was frightened and awoke from his sleep. He said to his scribes: ‘Bring the book of records,’ to read and to see what had happened to him. They opened the scrolls and found the matter that Mordekhai reported about Bigtana and Teresh. When they said to the king: “Here is Haman standing in the courtyard” (Esther 6:5), the king said: ‘The thing I saw in my dream is true. This one would not come at this hour except to kill me.’
<b>“The king said: Who is in the court? Haman had come into the outer court of the king's palace, to tell the king to hang Mordekhai on the gibbet that he had prepared for him” (Esther 6:4). </b><br>“To hang Mordekhai on the gibbet that he had prepared for him.” It is taught: He [Haman] prepared it for himself, and about him it is said: “Then against himself he readies deadly weapons, and makes his arrows sharp” (Psalms 7:14), and “He dug a pit and deepened it and he fell into the trap he made” (Psalms 7:16).
<b>“Haman entered, and the king asked him: ‘What is to be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor?’ Haman said in his heart: Whom would the king delight to honor besides myself?”  (Esther 6:6).</b><br>“Haman entered, and the king asked him… Haman said in his heart.” The wicked are controlled by their hearts: “Esau said in his heart” (Genesis 27:41); “The scoundrel said in his heart” (Psalms 14:1); “Yerovam said in his heart” (I Kings 12:26); “Haman said in his heart.” However, the righteous are in control of their hearts. That is what is written: “Hannah was speaking upon her heart” (I Samuel 1:13); “Daniel set over his heart” (Daniel 1:8); “David said to his heart” (I Samuel 27:1). And they are similar to their Creator: “The Lord said to his heart” (Genesis 8:21).
<b>“The king said to Haman: Hurry, take the garments and the horse; as you have said, do so to Mordekhai the Jew who sits at the king’s gate. Do not omit anything that you spoke of. Haman took the garments and the horse, dressed Mordekhai and led him, riding, through the city square and proclaimed before him: ‘So shall be done for anyone the king wishes to honor!’” (Esther 6:10-11).</b><br>“Take the garments and the horse… Haman took the garments and the horse.” He went to Mordekhai. When he [Mordekhai] was told that he was coming, he was very afraid, and he was sitting with his students before him. He said to his students: ‘My children, run and remove yourselves from here that you are not burned with my coal, as the wicked Haman is coming to kill me.’ They said: ‘If you die, we will die with you.’ He said to them: ‘If so, let us stand in prayer and pass away while praying.’ They completed their prayers and sat and engaged in the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Sefirat ha-Omer</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"> The commandment to count the days between Passover and Shavuot. When the Temple stood, they would bring a meal offering of barley measuring one <i>omer </i>(the <i>omer</i> offering) on the 16th of <i>Nisan</i>, the second day of Passover.</i> as that day was the 16th of <i>Nisan</i> and on that day they would bring the <i>omer</i> offering at the time when the Temple stood. Haman came to them and said to them: ‘What are you engaged in?’ They said to him: ‘In the commandment of the <i>omer</i>. That is what it says: “And if you present an offering of the first fruits to the Lord…”’ (Leviticus 2:14). There<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">For the residents of the Land of Israel, “there” refers to Babylonia, and vice versa. In the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Megilla</i> 16a) it is stated that Mordekhai was demonstrating to his students how to take a handful of a meal offering (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> they say: They showed him the <i>halakhot</i> of taking a handful [of a meal offering]. And [these interpretations] are one and the same, as they would take a handful from the <i>omer</i>. He said to them: ‘This <i>omer</i>, what is it? Is it [made] of gold or of silver?’ They said to him: ‘Not of gold and not of silver and not of wheat, but of barley.’ He said to them: ‘What is its value? Is it ten <i>kantrin</i>?’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Kantrin</i>, or singular <i>Kantar</i>, is a measurement of silver equivalent to one talent, ~33 kg.</i> They said to him: ‘It goes for ten <i>manin</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Manin</i>, or singular <i>maneh, </i>in this context is equivalent to the small silver coin known as a <i>ma’a.</i></i> He said to them: ‘Rise, for your ten <i>manin</i> have vanquished my ten thousand <i>kantrin</i> of silver.’ <br>Once [Mordekhai] had finished praying, Haman said to Mordekhai: ‘Put on these royal garments.’ He said to him: ‘Why are you dishonoring the monarchy? Is there any man who would put on royal garments without bathing?’ He [Haman] went and sought a bath attendant and could not find one. What did he do? He girded his loins and went in and bathed him. When he came out, he said to him: ‘Take this crown.’ He [Mordekhai] said to him: ‘Why are you dishonoring the monarchy? Is there any man who would put on a royal crown without a haircut?’<br>He [Haman] went and sought a barber and did not find one. What did he do? He went to his house and brought scissors and sat and gave him a haircut. He began to sigh. He [Mordekhai] said to him: ‘Why are you sighing?’ He said to him: ‘Woe to this man’s<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"> Referring to oneself in the first person was considered bad luck. “This man” in this context is Haman, referring to himself.</i> father – he [Haman] has been removed from being a high official and an overlord and has been made a bath attendant and a barber!’ He [Mordekhai] said to him: ‘That is why I asked you. Do I not know that the father of that man [Haman] was a bath attendant and a barber in Kefar Karyanus and you have found his barber tools?’ He [Haman] said to him: ‘Arise and ride this horse.’ He said to him: ‘I have not the strength [to mount it], for I am old.’ He said to him: ‘Am I not an old man?’ He said to him: ‘Was it not you who brought it on yourself?’ He said to him: ‘Get up, for I will bend my back for support and you step on me and get up and ride, to fulfill for you that which Scripture says: “And you shall tread on their high places” (Deut. 33:29).
Another interpretation: “Haman took the garments and the horse....” (Esther 6:11). He came to Mordekhai and said: ‘Rise and get dressed.’ How unlucky is this man; last night I was engaged in arranging a gibbet for him, and the Holy one blessed be He arranged a crown for him. ‘I would have arranged for you ropes and nails, and the Holy one blessed be He arranged for you royal garments. I sought from the king to hang you on a gibbet, and he said to mount you on a horse. Stand up and get dressed.’ And he did everything we said above. <br>When he [Mordekhai] was riding, he began praising the Holy one blessed be He: “I will exalt You, O Lord, for You have lifted me up and have not caused my enemies to rejoice over me. O Lord my God, I cried out to You and You have healed me. O Lord, You brought my soul up from the grave; You have given me life that I not go down to a pit” (Psalms 30:2–4). What did his students say? “Sing to the Lord, his devout ones, and give thanks to His holy name. For His anger is a moment, life is by His will; in the evening one may lie down weeping, and in the morning, joy” (Psalms 30:5–6). What did that wicked one say? “And I said in my tranquility, I shall never be shaken. O Lord, by Your will You set my mountain strong – You hid Your face, I became terrified” (Psalms 30:7–8). What did Esther say? “To You, O Lord, I will call, and to the Lord I will make supplication. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to destruction? Will dust thank You, will it declare Your truth?” (Psalms 30:9–10) What did the congregation of Israel say? “Hear O Lord and show favor to me; [O Lord, be my aid;] You have turned my lamenting into dance for me; [You have undone my sackcloth and girded me with joy]” (Psalms 30:11–12). What did the holy spirit say? “So that I can sing to You glorious praise, and not be silent, O Lord my God, forever I will thank You” (Psalms 30:13). <br>Haman’s daughter gazed from the window to see the hanging, and when she saw Mordekhai riding and her father declaring before him ‘so will be done for the man…,’ she cast herself to the ground and died.
<b>“Mordekhai returned to the king’s gate and Haman hastened home, mourning and covering his head” (Esther 6:12). </b><br>Mordekhai returned to the king’s gate; [this phrase] teaches that he returned to his sackcloth and fasting. Rabbi Ḥelbo said: Anyone who wears sackcloth and fasts does not cease to do so until his petition is fulfilled.
Mordekhai returned to the king’s gate and Haman hastened home, mourning and covering his head” (Esther 6:12) – Mourning for his daughter, and covering his head because of what had happened to him. He had performed four jobs: bath attendant, barber, orderly, and herald.
<b>“Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had befallen him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him: If Mordekhai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the progeny of the Jews, you will not overcome him, for you will fall before him” (Esther 6:13).</b><br> “Haman told his wife Zeresh…” At that moment the king’s attendants arrived and took him to the feast on the sixteenth of Nisan. When they had eaten and drunk, the king said to Esther: ‘What is your petition?’ She said to him: ‘My lord the king, I am only petitioning you for “my life with my petition, and my people with my request”’ (Esther 7:3).
<b>“The king rose in his fury from the wine banquet to the palace garden and Haman stood to plead for his life from Esther the queen, for he saw that the king has resolved to do him harm” (Esther 7:7).</b><br>“The king rose in his fury from the wine banquet to the palace garden.” What did the angel Michael do? He began cutting the saplings before him, adding fury to his fury; he returned to the wine banquet and Haman stood up to plead for his life. What did Michael do? He pushed him [Haman] onto Esther, and she was crying ‘My lord, the king, here he is overpowering me before you!’ The king said: “Will he also overpower the queen with me in the house?” (Esther 7:8). Haman heard this statement and his face fell. What did Eliyahu, of blessed memory, do? He appeared as Ḥarvona and said to him [to the king]: ‘My lord the king, “indeed, here is the gibbet that Haman had made for Mordekhai…”’ (Esther 7:9). As Rabbi Pinḥas said: One must say ‘Ḥarvona, of blessed memory.’ And Rav said: One must say ‘cursed is Haman, cursed are his sons, cursed is Zeresh his wife, as it is written: “The name of the wicked will rot”’ (Proverbs 10:7). <br>The king immediately commanded to hang him on the gibbet that he had prepared for Mordekhai, and about this, Solomon, in his wisdom, said: “A righteous person will be delivered from trouble and the wicked will come in his stead” (Proverbs 11:8). For Haman got up early to hang Mordekhai and was hanged himself on the gibbet that he prepared for Mordekhai, and [the king] gave everything that was Haman’s to Esther the queen, and Esther gave it to Mordekhai. This is what is written: “On that day King Aḥashverosh gave the house of Haman, adversary of the Jews, to Queen Esther…” (Esther 8:1), and it is written: “As for his harvest, the hungry will eat it and take it from shields [<i>tzinim</i>] and the bound [<i>tzamim</i>] will swallow their wealth”<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"> The midrash understands this verse idiosyncratically. The word <i>mitzinim</i>, here translated as ‘from shields,’ is usually translated as ‘from thorns’ or ‘from baskets.’ The word <i>tzamim</i>, here translated as ‘the bound,’ is usually translated as ‘the thirsty.’</i> (Job 5:5). “As for his harvest,” that is Haman. “The hungry will eat it,” that is Mordekhai and Esther. “Take it from shields,” not with a weapon, and not with a shield, but with prayer and supplication, as you say: “His truth is a shield [<i>tzina</i>] and a buckler” (Psalms 91:4). That is prayer, which protects him from trouble like a shield protects a person in battle. By the merit of prayer, which is called a shield, he will take Haman. From where [is it known] that they engaged in prayer? That is what is written: “Sackcloth and ashes were worn by many” (Esther 4:3). What is the use of sackcloth and ashes without prayer? “And the bound will swallow their wealth.” Who overcame Haman’s wealth? Mordekhai and Esther and those bound to them.
“And you, write about the Jews as is pleasing in your eyes in the name of the king” (Esther 8:8), and send to all the provinces “to destroy and to kill and to eliminate” (Esther 8:11) all the enemies of the Jews, “on the day that the enemies of the Jews had hoped to have power over them and it was reversed” (Esther 9:1) for them: “It will be renown for the Lord” (Isaiah 55:13) – this is the miracle that the Holy one blessed be He performed, the like of which has never been performed. Was there ever in the world an event like this miracle where Israel extracted vengeance against the nations of the world and did to their enemies as they wished?
<b>“The Jews gathered in their cities in all the provinces of King Aḥashverosh, to lay hand on those who sought their harm. And no one stood against them for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples” (Esther 9:2). </b><br>“The Jews gathered in their cities…and no one stood against them for the fear of them had fallen on all the peoples.” Israel was becoming stronger, like a lion that has fallen upon flocks of sheep and continues to prey with none to stop him. That is what is written: “The remnant of Israel will be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion upon the beasts of the forest, and like a young lion among the flocks of sheep…” (Micah 5:7). And they killed Haman’s sons and hanged them. Emperor Hadrian said to Rabbi Yehoshua: ‘Great is the lamb that survives among seventy wolves.’ He said to him: ‘Great is the shepherd who saves it [the lamb] and crushes them before it. That is what is written: “No weapon formed against you will succeed”’ (Isaiah 54:17).
<b>“And Mordekhai went out from before the king in royal dress of blue and white wool, and a great gold crown, and a robe of fine linen and purple. The city of Shushan reveled and rejoiced” (Esther 8:15). </b><br>“And Mordekhai went out from before the king in royal dress…” Rabbi Pinḥas says: Mordekhai reigned over the Jews. Just as the king wears purple, so did Mordekhai wear purple. Just as the king sets a great crown on his head, so did Mordekhai wear “a great gold crown” (Esther 8:15). Just as fear of the king is over the whole land, so was fear of Mordekhai over all of them, as it says: “For fear of Mordekhai had fallen upon them” (Esther 9:3). Just as the king’s coin is accepted in the entire land, so was Mordekhai’s coin accepted. And what was his coin? Mordekhai on one side and Esther on the other. Why? Because he was a good man and a peaceful man and sought peace, as it says: “For Mordekhai the Jew…[a seeker of good for his people and a spokesman of peace for all his descendants] (Esther 10:3). About him scripture says: “Mark the man of integrity and behold the upright one, for there is a future for the man of peace” (Psalms 37:37).
Rabbi Berekhya said: The Holy one blessed be He recorded the redemption of Israel in the Torah, as it is written: “If a stranger who is a resident among you shall prosper…” (Leviticus 25:47). “A stranger who is a resident” – that is Haman, who became great and grew rich, and became prosperous enough  to weigh out ten thousand talents of silver (see Esther 3:9). He is called a resident stranger since he was a descendant of Amalek and was a stranger in Media and Persia. “And your brother becomes poor with him” (Leviticus 25:47) – these are [the people of] Israel who were destitute and poor. “And is sold to a resident stranger” (Leviticus 25:47) – that Aḥashverosh sold them to Haman, to destroy, to kill and to eliminate. “Or to an offshoot [<i>eker</i>] of a stranger’s family” (Leviticus 25:47) – that he made himself an object of idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The midrash here follows the interpretation in <i>Kiddushin</i> 20a–b that an <i>eker</i> is a false god. According to that reading, the verse is referring to a Hebrew slave who was sold to serve in an idolatrous temple.</i> That is what is written: “Bowing and prostrating themselves to Haman” (Esther 3:2). “After he is sold, he shall have redemption” (Leviticus 25:48) – that the Holy One blessed be He redeemed them from his [Haman’s] hand and delivered them from his decree and rescued them. “One of his brothers shall redeem him” (Leviticus 25:48) – that is Mordekhai, as it is written about him “and accepted by most of his brethren” (Esther 10:3). “Or his uncle or his cousin shall redeem him” (Leviticus 25:49) – that is Esther, who was the daughter of his [Mordekhai’s] uncle, and Israel were redeemed by her. “For I will surely erase [<i>maḥo emḥeh</i>] the memory of Amalek” (Exodus 17:14) – erase [<i>maḥo</i>] in this world, surely erase [<i>emḥeh</i>] in the World to Come. “The memory [<i>zekher</i>] of Amalek” – that is Haman. Read with regard to him, “a male [<i>zakhar</i>] of Amalek.”<br>Even Jacob our forefather alluded to it in the blessing of the tribes: “Benjamin, a wolf who will take prey. In the morning he will consume plunder” (Genesis 49:27) – that is Saul, who was the morning of Israel, as he was the first of the kings and was from the tribe of Benjamin, and [he] smote Amalek and plundered everything they had. “And in the evening will distribute booty” (Genesis 49:27) – that is Mordekhai and Esther, who arose for Israel in their exile, which resembles the evening, and distributed the booty of Haman. [Benjamin] is compared to a wolf, as the Holy One blessed be He set him to stand against the wolf – that is the kings of Media and Persia, who are compared to a wolf. That is what is written, “And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling a wolf”<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The word in the verse, <i>dov</i>, is generally translated “bear.” However, when it is spelled without a <i>vav</i>, its meaning in Aramaic is “wolf.” In the verse from Daniel, which is written in Aramaic, <i>dov</i> is spelled without a <i>vav</i> (<i>Etz Yosef</i>).</i> (Daniel 7:5).

The Holy One blessed be He set Mordekhai and Esther to stand against them, as they were from the tribe of Benjamin, as it is written: “A wolf will take prey” (Genesis 49:27).
Rabbi Ḥiya Raba and Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta were walking in the valley of Arbel and they saw the breaking of the dawn’s light. Rabbi Ḥiya Raba said to Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta: So is the greatness of Israel. First a little and then, as it proceeds, it continuously increases. What is the explanation? “Although I sit in darkness, the Lord is a light for me” (Micah 7:8).<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Even while Israel sits in darkness, God is already setting in motion the chain of events that will lead to their redemption. So, too, the midrash cites the verse from Esther 2:21 in which Mordekhai sits at the king’s gate and hears the plot of Bigtan and Teresh. This event leads to the eventual salvation of the Jewish people.</i> So initially “Mordekhai was sitting at the king’s gate…” (Esther 2:21) and afterwards, “And Mordekhai went forth from the presence of the king [in royal dress of blue and white wool, and with a great crown of gold]” (Esther 8:15), and afterwards, “For the Jews there was light and joy and jubilation and honor” (Esther 8:16).
That is what is written: “Say to God: How awesome are Your works” (Psalms 66:3). How terrifying are Your wonders. [Those slated to be] killed, kill those who would be their killers, and [those slated to be] hanged, hang those who would hang them.
