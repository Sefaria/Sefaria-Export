...Another explanation. “As if a man flees from the lion…” (Amos 5:19) This refers to Nebuchadnezzar. “…and the bear meets him…” This refers to Belshazzar. “…and he comes to the house and leans his hand on the wall, and a serpent bites him.” This refers to Haman, who stirred up passions like a snake, as it is written “Rehum was the secretary, and Shimshai was the scribe…” he (Shimshai) was the son of Haman, “…they wrote a letter about Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, as is stated.” (Ezra 4:8) And what was written in the letter? “Now issue an order to stop these men…” and “…they will not give the king's due, the head tax, or the meal tax they will not give, and the tax of the kings will suffer.” (Ezra 4:13) ‘The king’s due (minda),’ refers to the measure of the land. ‘The head tax’ refers to the gold and silver tax. ‘Meal tax’ refers to forced labor. ‘and the tax of the kings will suffer,’ Rav Huna and Rabbi Pinchas said: even those things through which the government makes itself popular, like theater houses and circuses will be damaged. Since they sent the letter, their words were heeded and the work on the Temple was stopped. When the Jews saw this they all began to cry out, woe! “Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus…” (Esther 1:1)...


Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon opened: "From the kingship of the hypocritical man, from the ensnarers of the people."(Job 34:30) Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rosh Laqish – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: "At a time when the king is hypocritical – or any leader of people - it is snares (<i>moqesh</i>) to the people, because of their stubbornness (<i>qashuyot</i>) and the desire of the people who do not act to the will of the Creator of the World." Rabbi Shimon ben Laqish says: "Safer for people to grow wings for themselves and fly in the air, rather than be handed over and submit to the hand of a hypocritical king." Another interpretation: "from the kingship of the hypocritical man" this is Aḥasheverosh, who was hypocritical, for he killed his wife [Vashti] because of his friend [Memukhan], and another time he killed his friend [Haman] because of his wife [Esther]. Abba Oriyan, from Sidon, said five things in the name of Rabban Gamliel: "(1) When lying judges multiply, lying witnesses multiply. (2) When informants multiply, the people's money is stolen. (3) When brazenness multiplies, glory, majesty, and honor are taken from the people. [(4 - not printed here, but found in Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 920:10): When a younger says to an elder, "I am better than you," the years of people are shortened.] (5) When the beloved children act in a way that angers their Father in Heaven, He raises above them a hypocritical king who exacts retribution from them." And who is this? This is Aḥasheverosh. And thus when everyone saw this, they began to cry out, "Woe!" [(<i>vay</i>)] – "and so it was" [<i>vayehi</i>] in the days of Aḥasheverosh.

Rabbi Tanchuma, Rabbi Berakhiya, and Rabbi Chiya Rabbah and in the name of Rabbi Elazar [all] said, "This midrash came up to our hands from the exile - any place that it is stated, 'and it was (<i>vayehi</i>),' it is nothing but a term of grief [hinting to the sound, (<i>vay</i>), meaning woe]." Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan, " 'Any place that it is stated, "and it was in the days of," it is nothing but a term of grief.'" And there are five: (1) "And it was in the days of Amrafel" (Genesis 14:1). What grief was there over there? They made a war to kill Avraham, our father, as it is stated (Genesis  14:2), "made war." [It is comparable] to a dear friend of a king who entered a province, and on his account was the king [concerned] about that whole province. [Then] barbarians came and grappled with him with words. And when he wanted to leave, they all said to him, "Woe that the king will no longer be concerned about the province as he was": So [too,] was Avraham a dear friend of the Holy One, blessed be He - as it is written about him (Isaiah 41:8), "the seed of Avraham, My dear one"; and it is written (Genesis 12:3), "and through you shall all the families of the world be blessed." And when the kings came and grappled with him, they all said, "Woe that the Holy One, blessed be He, will not be concerned with the world as He was; since He was concerned with the world for his sake." This is [the meaning of] that which the verse stated (Genesis 14:7), "And they came to Ein Mishpat (which can be understand as the eye of justice)" - Rabbi Acha said, "They sought to grapple with no less than the eyeball of the world." They said, "They sought to blind the eye that [suppressed] the trait of [strict] judgment in the world." [The verse continues -] "It (<i>hee</i>) is Kadesh," [but] it is written, "he (<i>hu</i>) is Kadesh"; meaning to say, he sanctified (<i>hu kidesh</i>) the name of the Holy One, blessed be He and went down to the fiery furnace. When they saw that the things were like this, they cried out. (2) "And it was in the days of Achaz the son of Yoshiah, King of Yehudah" (Isaiah 7:1). What grief was there over there? "It is what is stated by the verse (Isaiah 9:11), "Aram is in front and the Philistines are behind, etc." [It is comparable] to a king that gave his son over to a mentor, and the mentor hated him. He said, "If I kill him, I will become liable for death. Rather, I will take away his nourishment from him and he will die on his own": So did the evil Achaz say, "If there are no goats, there will be no rams; if there is no flock, there will be no shepherd, [and] where will the world be?" So did he say, "If there are no masters, there will be no students; if there are no students, there will be no sages; if there is no Torah, there will be no synagogues and study halls." What did he do? He passed all the synagogues and study halls and sealed them. And this [is the meaning of] that which the verse states (Isaiah 8:16), "Bind up the message; seal the instruction with My disciples." And when they saw that the things were like this, they all started to cried out, "Woe that the world is being destroyed" - when [study of] the Torah was negated, that was in the days of Achaz. (3) "And it was in the days of Yehoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu" (Jeremiah 1:3). What grief was there over there? "I looked at the earth, and behold it was empty and void; at the heavens and their light was not" (Jeremiah 4:23), [It is comparable] to edicts of the kings that were brought to the provinces of the kingdom. In each and every province, when it came to their hands, everyone would stand on their feet, uncover their heads and read them with fear, trembling and perspiration. But when they were brought to the province of the king, they tore them up and burned them: When the Holy One, blessed be He, sends His messenger to the nations of the world, they repent, cover themselves in sackcloth and fast - as did the people of Nineveh, as it is stated (Jonah 3:7), "from the order of the king and his principals, etc." They, may their memory be blessed, said, "One who had a beam or a stone that was stolen in his house would destroy the house and remove it and return the theft." And because of this did Yonah fear to prophesy to Nineveh. As Rabbi Tarfon said, "The fish was designated, etc." And the nations of the world are afraid in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, and [so, they are] close to repentance, whereas Israel is stiff-necked. This is what the verse stated (Jeremiah 36:23), "And it was when Yehudi would read three columns or four" - meaning to say, he read four verses - and in the fifth verse, he read, "And her tormentors became the head" (Lamentations 1:5) - and it is is written (Jeremiah 36:23), "he would tear it with a scribe's blade and throw it into the fire until the end of all of the scroll." And when they saw this, everyone began to cry out, "Woe for the decree that is hanging over us." And the other (4) - "And it was in the days of Achashverosh" (Esther 1:1). What grief was there over there? [It is comparable] to a king that had a vineyard, and he had three enemies. What did they do? One cut the small berries, the second ripped the clusters and the third uprooted the vines: The king is King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He; His vineyard is Israel, as it is stated (Isaiah 5:7), "For a vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel"; [And] their three enemies are Pharaoh, Nevukhadnetsar and Haman. Pharaoh began with the small berries, as it is stated (Exodus 1:22), "Any son that is born, throw him into the river." Nevukhadnetsar ripped the clusters, as it is stated (Jeremiah 29:2), "the craftsmen and the smiths." Who are the craftsmen (<i>charash</i>)? These are the ones that pray the mute prayer silently, and are victorious with their prayer over all the nations of the world. The smiths?  That all the nations of the world come in a vice in front of them but [then] flee, as they put a vice on all the nations - and Nevukhadnetsar come to destroy them; and he destroyed the craftsmen and the smiths, and exiled them. The evil Haman [then] came [to] uproot the vines, as it is stated (Esther 3:13), "to annihilate, to kill and to destroy." Everyone began to cry out, "Woe," and they mourned in front of the Omnipresent. (5) "And it was in the days when the judges ruled" (Ruth 1:1) - there was famine there; and what grief is greater than famine? And from where [do we know] that there was famine? As it is stated (Ruth 1:1), "and there was a famine in the land." And why was there a famine? Because Israel and the judges were not judging true judgement; as it is is stated, "And it was in the days when the judges ruled" - [and] we find [following it], "he", which indicates evildoers. [As] so do we find, "he was Datan and Aviram" (Numbers 26:9); "he was Achashverosh" (Esther 1:1); "he was [...] Achaz" (II Chronicles 28:22). So too were the judges. And to what is the matter comparable? To a province that was liable a tax to the king. [So] he sent collectors to collect it. The people of the province rose and smote the collectors and hung them. The judgment that they were liable - as they appointed other judges for themselves - they did to the collectors. So did they do at that time, as Elimelekh would judge the judges; [since] he was a strongman and there were many men below him. He saw the distress and the famine, but he did not warn the sinners to repent from their evil. And he stopped living in Beit Lechem for himself to live in the field of Moav - to sustain his soul during the famine, and the soul of his wife during the famine, and the soul of his sons; and he did not know that [it is] the Torah that sustains its masters and not the vanities of the world. And he was one who was important, as it is stated (Ruth 1:1), "and a man went from Beit Lechem, Yehudah." And we only say, "man," about an important man, as it is stated (Numbers 12:3), "And the man, Moshe, was very humble." As Elimelekh was an important man, as they would consider him [so] in his place - and [yet] he went to save his soul and the soul of his household, and did not trouble himself about the matters of the community; even as he was an important man and they would have believed his words, [such as] to make them repent from their evil and bring them to repentance. And therefore, it occurred to him as it is written in the verse (Ruth 1:3), "And Elimelekh, the husband of Naomi died." And so [too,] his sons died, as it is stated (Ruth 1:5), "And [...his] two [sons,] Machlon and Khilyon died, and the woman survived her two children and her husband." As so were they judging their judges, like Sodom. Rabbi Shimon ben Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, "Any place that it is stated, 'and it was (<i>vayehi</i>),' it is used for grief and it is used for joy. And when for grief, there is no grief like it, and when for joy, there is no joy like it." (The text is missing the following integral part of the midrash, found in Bereishit Rabbah 42:3 and other places: Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman came and divided it, "Any place that it is stated 'it will be,' it is used for joy; [but] 'and it was' [is for] grief.") The Sages responded, "Behold 'And God said, "<i>Vayehi</i> (here used as a command form, and not past tense) light"' [is] joy!" He said to them, "It too is not of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. As so did Rabbi Yehudah bar Simon say, '[Regarding] the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam [could] look and observe from [one] end of the world to the [other] end. [But] since the Holy One, blessed be He, saw the deeds of the generation of Enosh and the generation of the flood, He arose and hid it from them. That is [the meaning of] what the verse states (Job 38:15), "From the wicked is their light withheld." And to where is it hidden? [It is] in the Garden of Eden, for the righteous ones, as it is stated (Psalms 97:11), "Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the straight-hearted."'" They responded to him further, "It states, 'And it was evening and it was morning, one day.'" He said to them, "On that day too, it is not of joy, as all the acts of the first day are destined to wither, as it is stated (Isaiah 51:6), 'when the heavens melt away like smoke and the earth wither like a garment.'" They responded to him, "Behold, the [acts of] the second day, the third day, the fourth day, the fifth day, the sixth day." He said to them, "They too are not of joy, as all the acts of the six days of creation require further action - for example, wheat needs to be ground; mustard needs to be mellowed; lupine need to be mellowed." They responded to him, "[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yosef and he was a successful man' (Genesis 39:7)?" He said to them, "It too is not of joy, as that 'bear' chanced upon him from this, as it is stated in the verse, 'after' - 'And it was after these things, and the wife of his master raised, etc.' (Genesis 39:7)." They responded to him, "[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yehoshua, and his reputation was in all the land' (Joshua 6:27)?" He said to them, "It too is not of joy, as Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin, fell at that time; as it is stated (Joshua 7:5), 'And the men of Ai smote of them, like thirty-six men' - and the master said, 'That is Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin.'" They responded to him, "And is it not written (I Samuel 18:14), 'And it was that David was successful in all of his ways and the Lord was with him'?" He said to them, "It too is not of joy, as enmity descended into the heart of Shaul from this, as it is stated (I Samuel 18:9), 'And it was that Shaul eyed David.'" They responded to him, "And is it not written (II Samuel 7:1), 'And it was when the king sat in his house and the Lord allowed him rest from all of his enemies'?" He said to them, "It too is not of joy, as on that same day, Natan the prophet came to David and said to him, 'However you will not build the House' (I Kings 8:19)." They said to him, "Behold, we have said what is ours; [now] say what is yours - that 'and it will be' is joy." He said to them, "'And it will be on that day that the mountains will drip with nectar' (Joel 4:18), that will be in the days of the messiah, and there will be great joy for Israel. And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that a man shall save alive a heifer of the herd and two sheep' (Isaiah 7:21). And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that living waters will come out from Jerusalem' (Zechariah 14:8). And so [too,] 'And he will be like a tree planted over streams of water' (Psalms 1:3). And so [too,] 'And the remnant of Yaakov will be among many nations' (Micah 5:6)." They said to him, "But behold, it is written (Jeremiah 38:28), '<i>vahaya</i> (here used in the past tense, and not like the other examples) when Jerusalem was captured'!" He said to them, "It too is not of grief, as on that day was the verdict of Israel for their sins taken; as so is it written (Lamentations 4:22), 'Your sin has been completed, Daughter of Zion, He will not again exile you.'"





Chapter 1

It was in the days [of Aḥashveirosh, he was Aḥashveirosh]: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said, "Because he darkened the faces of Israel like the sides of a pot." Rabbi B'rekhya said, "Because he withered the head of Israel with fasting and affliction." Rabbi Levi said, "Because he made them drink gall and wormwood." Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said, "Because he tried to destroy the roots of Israel". Rabbi Taḥlifa son of Bar Ḥana said, "Because he was the brother of a leader, the brother of Nevukhadnetzar." Could he have been his brother? Wasn't one a Chaldean and another a Median? But one suspended work on the Temple and the other destroyed it, so Scripture considers them equivalent. So is it said, "Also one one lazy in his work is a brother to the destroyer." (Proverbs 18:9) "Also one lazy in his work" - this is Aḥashveirosh who suspended work on the Temple. "A brother to the destroyer" - this is Nevukhadnetzar who destroyed the Temple. Another interpretation: Of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemia one said "Aḥashveirosh" - that he killed his wife because of his friend, "He was Aḥashveirosh" - that he killed his friend because of his wife. Rabbi Neḥemia said, "Aḥashveirosh" - that he suspended work on the Temple, "He was Aḥashveirosh" - that decreed it be rebuilt. Did he decree that it be rebuilt? Didn't Koresh decree that? It is written, "In the first year of King Koresh." (Ezra 6:3) In the days of the Prophet Ezra there were those in the cities who worshipped him like an idol. In their foolishness all his counselors came to him and said, "Your father decreed that it not be rebuilt and you decree that it be rebuilt?! Can a king cancel the decrees of the most high!" He said to them, "Bring me copies of the decrees". They brought them to him at once, as it is said "It was found in Aḥm'ta in the capitol" (Ezra 6:2). What was written in it? "Therefore make a decree to stop" (Ezra 4:21) He said to them, "Does it say forever? It only said 'until a decree is made by me.' Who can tell me that if my father were alive he would not have built it?" That is why he is included among the prophets, as it is said, "The elders of the Jews built and prospered etc." (Ezra 6:14) 

Chapter 2



Chapter 3


"<b>In addition, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for women</b> (Esther 1:9)": Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Simon began his sermon: ""My people’s rulers are babes, it is governed by women (Isaiah 3:12)". "My people’s rulers are babes (<i>me'olel</i>)": they are demanding toward them, and this verse corresponds: "And deal (<i>'olel</i>) with them (Lamentations 1:22)"". Another interpretation: "Babes": they pick all of their grapes (<i>'oleloteihen</i>), and this verse corresponds: "You shall not pick (<i>te'olel</i>) your vineyard bare (Leviticus 19:10)". [Another explanation:] They came to them with false charges, and this verse corresponds: "And makes up charges (<i>'alilot</i>) against her (Deuteronomy 22:14)". And Rabbi Yehudah son of Simon said: "Gigolos were with them, and this verse corresponds: "There will not be a male prostitute (Deuteronomy 23:18)", and this verse also corresponds: "They raped her and abused her (<i>yit'allelu</i>) all night long (Judges 19:25)". "It is governed by women": Rabbi Chonya said: "They leap on them like a creditor". Another interpretation: "It is governed by women": four women gained rulership in the world, and they were Jezebel and Athaliah from Israel and Semiramis and Vashti from the gentile nations of the world.
Another opinion: ""<b>In addition, Queen Vashti</b>": Samuel began his sermon: ""When they are heated, I will set out their drink (Jeremiah 51:39)". The Holy One, blessed is He, said: "When they come to warm themselves with the kingdom, "I will set out their drink", [in Aramaic] I will arrange their drinks, "And get them drunk" in their troubles, "that they may become hilarious" because they were rejoicing in the destruction of the Temple". The Holy One, blessed be He, said: "The Temple is ruined and this wicked man is celebrating. "<b>In addition, Queen Vashti</b>" this wicked woman is celebrating, as it is written:  "<b>In addition, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for women</b>". 

It is written: "You do look! You take note of mischief and vexation! To requite is in Your power. To You the hapless can entrust himself; You have ever been the orphan’s help (Psalm 10:14)". The congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: "Master of the universe, "You do look" that the wicked Esau came and is going to destroy the Temple and exile Israel from their land and chain them with collars. "To requite is in Your power" and you were resting your shekhinah on Isaac and said to him: "See, your abode shall enjoy the fat of the earth...yet by your sword you shall live (Genesis 27:39-40)". "To You the hapless can entrust himself", tomorrow he will come and take the orphans and widows and imprison them in the prison and say to them, as it is written: ""the father of the orphans and the judge of the widows (Psalm 68:6)" will come and save them from my hand". Rather "You have ever been the orphan’s help ". There were two twins who were left to him, these were Remus and Romulus. You gave them at first to a wolf to nurse, and later they stood and built two great huts in Rome". Another explanation: "You do look! You take note of mischief and vexation!": the congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: "Master of the universe, "You do look!" at Nebuchadnezzar the wicked man who came and destroyed the Temple and exiled Israel and chained them in collars. "To requite is in Your power" and you rested your shekhinah on Jeremiah and he said to us: "All nations shall serve him, his son and his grandson (Jeremiah 27:7)". "To You the hapless can entrust himself" tomorrow he comes and takes Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah and will place them in the midst of a fiery furnace and will say to them: "What god is there that can save you from my power? (Daniel 3:15)". Rather "You have ever been the orphan’s help": a certain orphan was left to him and you made her the <i>augusta</i> empress over a kingdom that was not hers. Who? She was Vashti.
It is written: "<b>From men, O Hashem, with Your hand, from men whose share in life is fleeting. But as to Your treasured ones, fill their bellies. Their sons too shall be satisfied, and have something to leave over for their young</b> (Psalms 17:14)". Rabbi Chanina son of Rabbi Acha went to a certain place and he found there this verse at the head of the order of reading: "And the remainder of the meal offering shall be for Aaron and his sons (Leviticus 2:3)", and he began his sermon: "<b>From men, O Hashem, with Your hand</b>", How great are these men whose  portion is "<b>with Your hand</b>": who are they? This is the tribe of Levi. "<b>From men whose share in life is fleeting</b>" these are those who do not take their portion in the land. "<b>But as to Your treasured ones</b>": these are the holy things of the Temple. "<b>Fill their bellies</b>": these are the holy things of the boundary. "<b>Their sons too shall be satisfied</b>": "Only the males in the priestly line may eat of it: it is most holy (Leviticus 6:22)". "<b>And have something to leave over for their young</b>": "And the remainder of the meal offering shall be for Aaron and his sons".
Another interpretation: "<b>From men, O Hashem, with Your hand </b> (Psalms 17:14)". How great are these men who acquire what is theirs "<b>with Your hand</b>": who are they? This is the generation of the destruction [by Hadrian]. "<b>From men (<i>mimetim</i>) with Your hand</b>": men put to death (<i>mumatim</i>) from your hand. "<b>From men whose share in life is fleeting</b>" these are those who raised up their flesh to be destroyed for the sanctification of your name. Who are they? Rabbi Shimon son of Yochai and Rabbi Eliezer. They were hidden in a cave for thirteen years during the destruction until their flesh was covered with sores and they ate carobs and dates and at the end of thirteen years Rabbi Shimon son of Yochai came out and sat at the mouth of the cave. He saw a certain hunter spreading out his nets to capture birds and he heard a voice calling out saying "<i>demos</i>" ["acquitted"] and the bird flew away, and then he heard the voice call out saying "<i>spicula</i>" ["condemned"] and it was caught. He said: "If a bird without heaven  cannot flee, how much more for ourselves. Let us go down and let us take the water at the pool of Tiberias. So they went down and took the waters in that spring of Tiberias and said: "We must do good and benefit the people of this place according to the way of our father Jacob, as it is said: "And he encamped before the city (Genesis 33:18)": which means he made bazaar stalls and sold them cheap things, so they made bazaar stalls and sold cheaply. David said before the Holy One, blessed be He: "Master of the universe, will you say that I have a portion with them in the world to come?" and the Holy One, blessed be He, replied to him: "David, no. "<b>Your treasured ones fill their bellies</b>"; "their treasured ones fill their bellies is not written" but rather "<b>Your treasured ones fill their bellies</b>": all people are going to fill their bellies and eat, and David was shown that he had a portion in the world to come. Further he said before Him: "Master of the universe, these came with the strength of Torah, commandments and good deeds and they are in their hand, but "then I, justified, will behold Your face (Psalms 17:15)" forever.
Another interpretation: "<b>From men, O Hashem, with Your hand</b> (Psalms 17:14)".  How great are these men whose rulership is beneath "<b>Your hand, O Hashem</b>": who is this? This is Nebuchadnezzar. "<b>From men</b>" these are those who take their portion in the land. "<b>Whose share in life is fleeting</b>": these are those who take their share when they are alive. "<b>But as to Your treasured ones, fill their bellies</b>": they are  wealthy from what was hidden in cellars. "<b>Their sons too shall be satisfied</b>": this is Evil Merodach and Belshazzar. "<b>And have something to leave over for their young</b>": one orphan was left to his and you made her the <i>augusta</i> empress over a kingdom which was not her own. And who is this? This is Vashti.
Another interpretation: "<b>In addition, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for women</b> (Esther 1:9)". What did the scripture mean when it described the banquet of Vashti? Rabbi Yehoshua son of Karchah said: "This is why, to reveal what kind of life of ease Esther was joined to". Rabbi Meir said: "If thus it goes for the one who provokes him, it is a <i>qal vechomer</i> inference; [how much more] for those who do his will". Another interpretation: "<b>In addition, Queen Vashti</b>". The word "<b>in addition</b>" is a term of hermeneutic expansion (<i>ribbuy</i>). As this one with six wonders, so that one with six wonders. As this one with with expenses going out, so that one with expenses going out. As this one with a banquet in the style of the land of Israel, so that one with a banquet in the style of the land of Israel. As this one with the garments of the Kohen Gadol, so that one with the garments of the Kohen Gadol. Rabbi Berechya said: and see, she was a crow that wears what his hers and what is not hers". Another interpretation: "<b>In addition, Queen Vashti</b>". "<b>In addition</b>" the banquet of Vashti would happen, the time would also come for Vashti to be ended, the time would come for Vashti to be cut off, the time would come for Vashti to be pressed. Rabbi Huna said: "The time would come for her to die, and this verse corresponds: "She took of its fruit and ate. She also gave some to her husband (Genesis 3:6)". 
"<b>Gave a banquet for women</b> (Esther 1:9)": she had them eat all sorts of delicacies. Rabbi Yitchak says: "She had them eat all sorts of sweets". "<b>In the royal palace</b>": she placed them in large rooms because according to the way of women which is to act disgracefully. Another interpretation: "<b>In the royal palace</b>": she placed them in decorated rooms, on which Rabbi Avun said: "A woman wants to be in decorated rooms and in decorated clothes, instead of eating fat calves". Another interpretation: "<b>In the royal palace</b>": she placed them in her reception room, saying that if the husband of one of them would rebel, then his wife would be placed in front of her and he would not rebel. "<b>Of King Ahasuerus</b>": Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: "Even place where it is said in the megillah "<b>Of King Ahasuerus</b>" the scripture means  to refer to King Achashverosh, and every place where it is said "of the king" without specifying, it can refer to the Holy King or an earthly king.
"<b>On the seventh day</b> (Esther 1:10)": Rabbi Yehoshua son of Levi said: "This was the day of Shabbat". "<b>When the king was merry with wine</b>": Rabbi Yitzchak said: "Idolaters do not have merriment (<i>tov</i>), as it is written: "And it will not be well (<i>tov</i>) with the scoundrel (Ecclesiastes 8:13)". They objected: "Is it not written: "<b>When the king was merry with wine</b>""? He said to them: ""In  merriment (<i>betov</i>) was the king" is not written but "<b>As if merry (<i>ketov</i>) the king</b>" merry and not merry, but the merriment of Israel is complete merriment, as it is said: "And went to their homes, joyful and glad of heart over all the goodness (<i>kol hattovah</i>) (1 Kings 8:66)". 
"<b>He ordered Mehuman, Bizzetha</b> (Esther 1:10)": Rabbi Yochanan said: "At that very time the Holy One, blessed be He, called to the angel appointed over wrath (<i>memunnah al hachemah</i>) and said to him: "Bizzetha, plunder (<i>boz</i>) his house; "<b>Harbona</b>" I will lay waste (<i>achareiv</i>) his house. "<b>Bigtha, Abagtha</b>" and I will spoil and plunder (<i>buz uvizbuz</i>)"". Rabbi Shimon son of Rabbi Yannai said: "The Holy One, blessed be He: "I am laughing at them; I will bring women who tread wine from behind the beams"". "<b>Zethar</b>": Rabbi Yaakov son on Avina before Rabbi Yitzchak translated: "Lewdness (<i>zenut</i>), see it is of the wicked". "<b>And Carcas</b>": <i>karkasa</i> is written; Rabbi Samuel son of Nachman said: "This is in the Greek language, it is the word <i>karkason</i> [<i>keruxon</i> meaning "announce!"]. "<b>The seven eunuchs in attendance on King Ahasuerus</b>" the kingdom does not appoint less than "<b>seven eunuchs in attendance on the king</b>".
"<b>To bring Queen Vashti before the king wearing a royal diadem</b> (Esther 1:11)": Rabbi Aybo said: "Atonement of Israel! When Israel eats and drinks and celebrates, they bless and praise and glorify the Holy One Blessed Be He. But when the nations of the world eat and drink, they occupy themselves with tasteless words. This one says: "Median women are fair!", and this one says: "Persian women are fair!". The fool said to them: "The vessel that this man uses is neither Median nor Persian, rather Chaldean. Do you all desire to see her?" They said to him: "Yes, but only if she is naked". He said to them: "Yes, and naked"".  Rabbi Pinchas and Rabbi Hama bar Guria said in the name of Rab: "She requested to enter even wearing bells like a prostitute, but they did not allow her. He said to them: "and naked". She said: "I will enter without my crown". They [will] say she is a maidservant. Put on royal garments and enter! [=Even in royal garments, they will say that a maidservant can masquerade as a queen.]" Rav Huna said: "A commoner does not make use of royal garments".
"<b>But Queen Vashti refused</b> (Esther 1:12)": She sent and said to him words that touched his heart. She said to him: If they see that I am fair, they will try to make use of me and kill you. But if they see that I am ugly, you will be denigrated through me". She was speaking subtly to him but he did not understand her subtlety; she was pricking him but he was not pricked. She sent and said to him: "You were the <i>comes estabularius</i>, the stable master of my father's house and you were experienced in leading before yourself prostitutes naked and now that you have come into kingship you have not changed from your debauchery". She was speaking subtly to him but he did not understand her subtlety; she was pricking him but he was not pricked. She sent and said to him: "The <i>ekdikus</i>, one found guilty in court, of my father's house were not judged naked. See! It is written: "So these men, in their shirts, trousers, hats, and other garments (Daniel 3:21)"". Rabbi Yudan said: "In their robes", and Rabbi Huna said: "In their official uniforms". Rabbi Shimon son of Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: "The Holy One, blessed be He, does not judge the wicked regarding Gehinnom except naked. And how do we know that? It is written: "When You are aroused You despise their image (Psalm 73:20)"". Rabbi Samuel son of Nachman said: "Those of bandits are executed where he lies in ambush". Rabbi Nathan said: "But Egyptians in their descent into the sea they were not judged except naked. How do we know this? "At the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up (Exodus 15:8)"". And Rabbi Samuel son of Nachman in the name of Rabbi Yonatan said: "The wicked does not go out of the world until the Holy One, blessed be He, reveals the net in which he is going to be snared". 
"<b>The king was greatly incensed, and his fury (<i>chamato</i>) burned within him</b> (Esther 1:10)": Rabbi Yochanan said: "At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke to the angel appointed over wrath (<i>chemah</i>): "Make him feel hate, blow the ash in his belly, and ignite with his sparks and throw sulfur in his oven"". Rabbi Yochanan said: "For all the years from the time that Vashti was executed until Esther was chosen, the anger of Achashverosh was not forgotten". They objected: "But it is written: "<b>When the anger of King Ahasuerus subsided</b> (Esther 2:1)". He said to them: "It is not written "when the anger (<i>beshokh</i>) subsided of the king" but rather "<b>as the anger (<i>keshokh</i>) subsided of the king</b>": he was forgetting it but he had not forgotten it. When was his anger forgotten? When Haman was impaled. See! It is written: "<b>So they impaled Haman on the stake which he had put up for Mordecai, and the king’s fury abated</b> (Esther 7:10)": the anger of the King of kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He". 

Chapter 4

"<b>Then the king consulted the sages learned in procedure</b> (Esther 1:13)": who were they? Rabbi Simon said: "This was the tribe of Issachar. See! It is written: "Of the Issacharites, men who knew how to interpret the signs of the times, to determine how Israel should act; their chiefs were 200, and all their kinsmen followed them (1 Chronicles 12:33)"". Rabbi Tanchuma said: "For the calendar". And Rabbi Jose son of Katzrat said: "For intercalation". "To determine how Israel should act": because they knew how to heal skin ailments. "Their chiefs were 200": these were the 200 heads of the Sanhedrins which arose from the tribe of Issachar. "And all their kinsmen followed them": and all of them agreed in their halakhah with the halakhah of Moses from Sinai. That evil man said to them: "Because I made a decree for Vashti that she come before me naked and she did not come, what is the judgment for her?". They said to him: "Our lord king, when we were in our land we were asking the urim and tummim and now were are shaken", and they read before him this verse: "Moab has been secure from his youth on— He is settled on his lees And has not been poured from vessel to vessel— He has never gone into exile. Therefore his fine flavor has remained And his bouquet is unspoiled (Jeremiah 48:11)". He said to them: "Is there one from that country [Moab]?". They said to him: "Their relations (<i>qariveihon</i>)". See! It says this: "<b>His closest advisers (<i>haqqarov</i>) were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven ministers of Persia and Media</b> (Esther 1:14)". "The righteous man is rescued from trouble, and the wicked man takes his place (Proverbs 11:18)". ""The righteous man is rescued from trouble": this is the tribe of Issachar. "And the wicked man takes his place": these are "<b>the seven ministers of Persia and Media</b>". Another interpretation: "<b>His closest advisers</b>": it is written: "The impious man destroys his neighbor through speech, but through their knowledge the righteous are rescued (Proverbs 11:9)". "The impious man destroys his neighbor through speech": these are "<b>the seven ministers of Persia and Media</b>". "But through their knowledge the righteous are rescued": this is the portion of Issachar. Another interpretation: "<b>His closest advisers</b>": it is written: "A wise man is diffident and shuns evil, but a dullard rushes in confidently (Proverbs 14:16)". ""A wise man is diffident and shuns evil": this is the tribe of Issachar. "But a dullard rushes in confidently": these are "<b>the seven ministers of Persia and Media</b>". Another interpretation: "<b>His closest advisers</b>": it is written: "The shrewd man saw trouble and took cover; the simple kept going and paid the penalty (Proverbs 22:3)". "The shrewd man saw trouble and took cover": this is the tribe of Issachar. "The simple kept going and paid the penalty": these are "<b>the seven ministers of Persia and Media</b>".  
"<b>His closest advisers (<i>haqqarov</i>) were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan</b> (Esther 1:14)": "<b>His closest advisers (<i>haqqarov</i>)</b>": they drew near (<i>hiqrivu</i>) punishment on themselves. "<b>Carshena</b>": because he was appointed over the carshina plants. "<b>Shethar</b>": because he was appointed over the wine. "<b>Admatha</b>": because he was appointed over the bazaar (<i>attunas</i>) in the land. "<b>Tarshish</b>": because he was appointed over the house. "<b>Meres</b>": because he pureed (<i>memares</i>) birds. "<b>Marsena</b>": this man ground (<i>memares</i>) the flour. "<b>Memucan</b>": this man was the procurer of food for all of them. His wife prepared for them all which they needed. The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: "If what this evil man is successful who will bring offerings before you? "<b>Carshena</b>": who will ever offer before You an ox (<i>par</i>) of the first year (<i>shanah</i>)? “<b>Shethar</b>”: who will ever offer before You two turtledoves (<i>shetei torim</i>)? “<b>Admatha</b>”: who will ever build before You an altar of earth (<i>adama</i>): "Make for Me an altar of earth (Exodus 20:21)"? “<b>Tarshish</b>”: who will ever minister before You in the priestly vestments: “A beryl (<i>tarshish</i>), an onyx, and a jasper (Exodus 28:20)"? “<b>Meres</b>”: who will ever stir (<i>memares</i>) the blood of the bird offerings before You? “<b>Marsena</b>”: who will ever stir (<i>memares</i>) the meal-offering before You? “<b>Memucan</b>”: who will ever establish (<i>mekhin</i>) before you the altar, exactly as it says: "They set up (<i>vayyakhinu</i>) the altar on its site (<i>mekhonotav</i>) (Ezra 3:3)"? To them the Holy One, blessed be He, said of Israel: "They are my children, they are my friends, they are my close ones, they are my beloved ones, they are the children of my beloved": this is Abraham, as it is written: "Seed of Abraham My beloved (Isaiah 41:8)". I am exalting their horn, just as it is said: "He has exalted the horn of His people (Psalm 148:14)". Another interpretation: "<b>Carshena</b>": the Holy One, blessed be He said: "I will scatter carshina plants before them and remove them from the world". "<b>Shethar</b>": "I will force them to drink a cup of reeling (<i>shel tar-'elah</i>)". "<b>Admatha, Tarshish</b>": "I will treat their blood (<i>daman</i>) like water. "<b>Meres, Marsena, Memucan</b>": "I will crush (<i>memares</i>), twist (<i>mesares</i>) and smash (<i>mema'ekh</i>) their souls in their insides". And from where was the fate of all of them prepared? Rabbi Hoshaya said: "From Isaiah the prophet, for agreeing it says: "Prepare a slaughtering block for his sons Because of the guilt of their father. Let them not arise to possess the earth! (Isaiah 14:21)". 
"<b>The seven ministers of Persia and Media</b> (Esther 1:14)": Rab and Samuel: Rab said: "The scripture is speaking about the kingdom of Achashverosh", and Samuel said: "The scripture is speaking about the kingdom of Belshazzar". On the opinion of Rab who said it was about the kingdom of Achashverosh, that is the preferred opinion. On the opinion of Samuel who said it was about the kingdom of Belshazzar, in what respect were they all those years? Rabbi Huna said: "Because they did not make use of the vessels of the Temple. See! It is written: "Under the influence of the wine, Belshazzar ordered the gold and silver vessels that his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple at Jerusalem (Daniel 5:2)" so from  this: "Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was killed at night (Daniel 5:30)". 
"<b>Who had access to the royal presence and occupied the first place in the kingdom</b> (Esther 1:14): two of the families were allowed to come before Rabbi [Yehudah]. One was from Rabbi Hoshaya and one was from the house of Rabbi Yehudah son of Pazzi, and when Rabbi Yehudah son of Pazzi was married into Rabbi's [family], they sought [the privilege] to come in first, and Rabbi Ammei did not allow it; he said to them: "It is written: "Then set up the Tabernacle according to the manner of it that you were shown (Exodus 26:30)". And is there a judgment for trees? Rather a wooden board which was worthy to be placed on the north will be placed on the north, and one which was worthy to be placed on the south will be placed on the south". In investigation, whence did they decide? Rabbi Simon said to them: "From the south, as it is said: "Hashem replied, “Let [the tribe of] Judah go up" (Judges 1:2)". Rabbi Manei said to him: "This is in war, but as to voting on appointment, "<b>Who had access to the royal presence and occupied the first place in the kingdom</b>", so here those "<b>Who had access to the royal presence</b>".
"<b>“What shall be done, according to law"</b> (Esther 1:15)": Rabbi Yitzchak said: "for this pig "<b>according to law</b>". And for a holy nation which is not according to the law but is instead in cruelty. "<b>And with Queen Vashti</b>": how much more so with a queen who is not Vashti.
"<b>Thereupon Memucan declared in the presence of the king and the ministers</b> (Esther 1:16)": why did Memucan choose to jump in first? From this: a commoner jumps to the head. Rabbi Pinchas and Rabbi Chilkiyyah in the name of Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Yochanan: One side said: "Our judgment is like their judgment" and the other side said:"Our judgment is not like their judgment". Based on what did one say: "Our judgment is like their judgment"? Their judgment "In non-capital cases and those concerning uncleanness and cleanness [the judges declare their opinion] beginning from the eldest, but in capital cases they begin from [them that sit at] the side (Sanhedrin 4:2)". And based on what did one say: "Our judgment is not like their judgment"? How does one account for "<b>Thereupon Memucan declared</b>"? Acceptable are the words of Rabbi Yehudah; acceptable are the words of Memucan". Rabbi Yochanan said: "The Amoraim have three explanations: One said: "Because she struck him sideways with her shoe on his face on both this way and that". Another said: "Because she did not notify his wife of the banquet for women". And another said: "Because he had a daughter and he was seeking to marry into the kingdom". On what basis did he say: "Because she struck him sideways with her shoe on his face on both this way and that"? He said: "<b>Queen Vashti has committed an offense not only against Your Majesty</b>". On what basis did another say: "Because she did not notify his wife of the banquet for women"? He said: "<b>For the queen’s behavior will make all wives despise their husbands</b> (Esther 1:17)". On what basis did another say: "Because she was his daughter and he was seeking to marry into the kingdom"? He said: "<b>Bestow her royal state upon another who is more worthy than she</b> (Esther 1:19)". 
"<b>For the queen’s behavior will make all wives despise their husbands</b> (Esther 1:17)": Rab Samuel said: "Even if not, this was needed".
"<b>This very day the ladies of Persia and Media, who have heard of the queen’s behavior, will cite it to all Your Majesty’s officials, and there will be no end of scorn and provocation</b> (Esther 1:18)": Rab and Samuel: Rab said: "This "<b>scorn</b>" was appropriate for "<b>provocation</b>"" and Samuel said: "This "<b>provocation</b>" was appropriate for "<b>scorn</b>"". Rabbi Chanina said: "This "<b>contempt</b>" was appropriate because her father had contempt for the vessels of the Temple, for "<b>provocation</b>" because he provoked her and killed her".  
"<b>If it please Your Majesty, let a royal edict be issued by you</b> (Esther 1:19)": He said to him: "My lord king, you bring forth the word from your mouth and I will gather her head on a plate". "<b>And let it be written into the laws of Persia and Media, so that it cannot be abrogated</b>": Rabbi Chanina son of Rabbi Abbahu said: "It is written: "He injures, but He binds up; He wounds, but His hands heal (Job 5:18)". In the language in which the kingdom was removed from her ancestor, which Samuel said to him: "And has given it to another who is worthier than you (1 Samuel 15:28)". With the language in which the kingdom was restored to him, see, it is written: "<b>And let Your Majesty bestow her royal state upon another who is more worthy than she</b>". 
"<b>Then will the judgment executed by Your Majesty resound</b> (Esther 1:20)": Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yitzchak: Rabbi Levi said: "A great judgment will "<b>resound</b>" from this one who has entered into the kingdom. What is that? "There was great mourning among the Jews (Esther 4:3)"". And Rabbi Yitzchak said: "A great judgment will "<b>resound</b>" from this one who has entered into the kingdom. What is that? "<b>There was gladness and joy among the Jews</b> (Esther 8:17)"". Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Simon said: "<b>Then will the judgment will resound</b>" of the King of kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, who said in his wisdom and understanding: "I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven! (Exodus 17:14)". "<b>Great though it is</b>": Rab and Samuel: One said: "See, the kingdom was "<b>great</b>" because of the sin", and the other said: "See, the sin was <b>great</b>" because of the kingdom". "<b>And all wives will treat their husbands with respect, high and low alike</b>"
"<b>The proposal was approved by the king and the ministers</b> (Esther 1:21)": He decreed and he brought her head on a plate.
"<b>Dispatches were sent to all the provinces of the king</b> (Esther 1:22)": Rabbi Huna said: "Achashverosh, his decree was stupid. The custom of this world is a man seeks to eat lentils and his wife seeks to eat beans, is he able to bend her? Is not that she eats what pleases her?" Rabbi Pinchas said: "Not only that, but also he was made ridiculous in the world. The custom of this world is a Mede marries a Persian woman and does she speak Median as her language? A Persian marries a Median woman and does she speak Persian as her language? But the Holy One, blessed be He, speaks with Israel in the language which they learned. See! It is written: "I (<i>anokhi</i>) am Hashem your God (Exodus 20:2)", the language is <i>chanokh</i> [the word for "I" in Coptic Egyptian]. Rabbi Nathan from Beit Gurvin said: "Four beautiful languages there are which are used by those in the world: Greek for singing, Persian for laments, Hebrew for speaking, and Latin for fighting", and there are those who say: "Aramaic for writing". Hebrew is spoken but it does not have a writing system. Aramaic has a writing system but is not for speaking. They chose to write in Aramaic letters and to speak in Hebrew. A certain man in a guard house said: "Carve for them the Latin language from the Greek language". Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Simon said: "It is a disgrace that that they [the Romans] seal documents in a language not their own. And Rab Chanin son of Ada said: "Claws of bronze (Daniel 7:19)": she does not seal except in her own language. Rab Samuel the son of Nachman said: "From this a man must repeat his <i>parshiyot</i>, if Moses did not repeat the Torah to us [in Deuteronomy] we would not know from there about the "camel (<i>shesu'ah</i>) (Deuteronomy 14:7)", and if Daniel did not repeat the dream to us we would not know from there "claws of bronze". 

Chapter 5

Rabbi Azariah began his sermon: "Do not ogle that red wine as it lends its color to the cup, as it flows on smoothly (Proverbs 23:31)". Rabbi Azariah said: ""Do not ogle that red wine": because one will covet the blood of a menstruating woman and the blood of a woman with a flow. "As it lends its color to the cup (<i>bakkos</i>)": <i>bakkis</i> ("in a bag") is written as a euphemism, and this verse agreeing says: "We shall all have a common purse (<i>kis</i>) (Proverbs 1:14)". "As it flows on smoothly": in the end, his wife speaks to him: "I saw [a mark] like a red rose", and he does not refrain from her". Rabbi Asei said: "If he is a wise student, at the end he makes clean the contaminated and contaminates the clean". Another interpretation: "Do not ogle that red wine": it definitely reddens him. "As it lends its color (<i>'eyno</i>) to the cup": he fixes his eyes (<i>eynav</i>) on the cup; the bartender fixes his eyes on the purse (<i>bakkis</i>) [hence explaining what is written]. "As it flows on smoothly (<i>meisharim</i>)": in the end he will empty out (<i>meisher'a</i>) his house. He says: "What does this ladle of bronze do? What does a ladle of clay do?" and he sells it and he drinks wine with its price. And [he says]: "What does this pot of bronze do? What does a pot of clay do?" and he sells it and he drinks wine with its price. Rabbi Yitzchak son of Radifah said in the name of Rabbi Amei: "In the end he sells all the furnishings of his house and drinks wine with them". Rabbi Acha said: "There is a story about a certain man who sold all the furnishings of his house and drank wine with them, and his children said to him: "This old man drink away everything and then die? What do we do? Let us get him alcohol and get him drunk and prepare him for burial and lay him out in the cemetery". They did that, and left him in the cemetery. The wine merchants were passing by that cemetery and they heard that that province's taxes were being collected so they abandoned their wineskins  in the cemetery. When the man woke up he saw wineskins piled around his head. He took it and began to drink. His children said three days later: "Let us go and see how our father is". They came and found him drinking! They said: "See how your Creator cares for you. This is your fate from heaven, and we do not know what do do with you!". His children decided that a different one each day would give him a drink. It is written: "You will be like one lying in bed on high seas, like one lying on top of the rigging (Provers 23:34)". You will be like one lying in bed on high seas"
"<b>Some time afterward, when the anger of King Ahasuerus subsided</b> (Esther 2:1)": Rabbi Ayyvu in the name of Rabbi Jose son of Zimra said: "Every place where "afterward" (<i>achar</i>) is said it means "immediately" [but where it says] "after" (<i>acharei</i>) it means "some time later". And the Rabbis based on Rabbi Jose son of Zimra: "Every place where "afterward" (<i>achar</i>) is said it means "some time later" [but where it says] "after" (<i>acharei</i>) it means "immediately". "<b>When the anger of King Ahasuerus subsided</b>", "right when it subsided" (<i>beshokh</i>) is not written here but rather "as it subsided" (<i>keshokh</i>): it was subsiding but had not subsided. "<b>He remembered Vashti</b>": that decree which he had decreed upon her that she come naked before him and if she did not come, it would apply to her and kill her and after he did this he had regret. Why? "<b>What she had done</b>" was appropriate. "<b>And what was decreed against her</b>" was improper. And why did it happen to her thus? Because she did not release Ahashverosh to begin the rebuilding of the Temple, and she said to him: "What my fathers destroyed, you seek to rebuild?". "<b>The king’s servants who attended him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for Your Majesty</b> (Esther 2:2)". 
"<b>Let Your Majesty appoint officers in every province of your realm to assemble all the beautiful young virgins at the fortress Shushan</b> (Esther 2:3)". Why? Rabbi Huna said because they were despising the daughters of Israel as unattractive, and every foreigner would not look at them, and so they came to the hand of theman assembling them. Rabbi Chanina the son of Shilka and Rabbi Joshua of Sikhnin and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: "An Israelite and a gentile are neighbors in one courtyard and the Israelite crushed his food in a jar and the gentile touched it, it is not contaminated, and if a gentile crushed his food in a jar and an Israelite touched it, he says that it is contaminated? But rather there fell together in it foul things and creeping things, the gentile would eat it, and if the Israelite were to have the same thing happen he would break it. So it is written: "Summon archers against Babylon, All who draw the bow! Encamp against her roundabout, Let none of her people escape. Pay her back for her actions (Jeremiah 50:29)". And did she take silver for which she should give silver? Did she take gold for which she should give gold? "They have ravished women in Zion, Maidens in the towns of Judah (Lamentations 5:11)": what does this teach? So the Holy One, blessed be He said: "You burned after nakedness; by your lives I am bringing upon you a nation which will not seek gold and silver from you. See! It is written: “Behold, I stir up the Medes against them, Who do not value silver Or delight in gold (Isaiah 13:17)". And what do they seek from you? "Their bows shall shatter the young; They shall show no pity to infant (Isaiah 13:18)". "<b>Under the supervision of Hege, the king’s eunuch, guardian of the women</b>": he was blotted out [a eunuch, whose name is blotted out because he has no children] and he was appointed over the maidens and similarly later "<b>in charge of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, guardian of the concubines</b> (Esther 2:14)", he was blotted out [a eunuch] and he was appointed over the women. 
"<b>And let the maiden who pleases Your Majesty be queen instead of Vashti.” The proposal pleased the king, and he acted upon it</b> (Esther 2:4)": Who was suitable for this thing? Mordechai: "<b>In the fortress Shushan lived a Jew by the name of Mordecai</b> (Esther 2:5)". And similarly: "God looked upon the Israelites, and God took notice of them (Exodus 2:25)". Who was suitable for this thing? Moses: "And Moses was a shepherd (Exodus 3:1)". And similarly: "Samuel then said to the men of Israel, “All of you go home (1 Samuel 8:22)". Who was suitable for this thing? Saul, as it is said: "There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish (1 Samuel 9:1)". And similarly: "When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine they were dismayed and terror-stricken (1 Samuel 17:11)". Who was suitable for this thing? David: "David was the son of a certain Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah (1 Samuel 17:12)". Rabbi Yehoshua son of Aviram said two things: "It is written: "And he had oppressed Israel strongly (Judges 4:3)": what does "strongly" (<i>chazaqah</i>) mean? Rabbi Yitzchak said: "With shaming and blaspheming". How? It says: "You have spoken hard words (<i>chazqu</i>) against Me (Malachi 3:13)". Who was suitable for this thing? Deborah. See! It is written: "Deborah, wife of Lappidoth, was a prophetess (Judges 4:4)"". Rabbi Yehoshua son of Aviram said another: ""The troops—the officers of Gilead—said to one another, “Let the man who is the first to fight the Ammonites be chieftain over all the inhabitants of Gilead (Judges 10:18)". Who was suitable for this thing? Jephthah: "Jephthah the Gileadite was an able warrior (Judges 11:1)"". 

Chapter 6

"Happy are those who act justly, who do right at all times (Psalms 106:3): they were counting a vote in the upper room of Rabbi Tarfon and they said: "What is this person "who does right at all times"? If you say they are the scribes and teachers of the mishnah, do they not eat, do they not drink, do they not sleep? Or rather those who write tefillin and mezuzot, do they not eat, do they not drink, do they not sleep? What is this person "who does right at all times"? There are some who say that this is the one who raises the orphan in his own home. Could you say to that that he turns to and fro naked in the night?" They said: "We have need for the Moadite". Rabbi Eleazar the Moasite came and he taught: "The Torah did not say that, but rather the piece of bread which he eats within his house". Another opinion: "Happy are those who act justly, who do right at all times (Psalms 106:3): this is Mordechai "who did right at all times" as he raised an orphan girl in his own home. David said before the Holy One, blessed be He: "Master of the universe, "Be mindful of me, Hashem, when You favor Your people (Psalms 106:4)" you who will cause deliverance for Israel by the hand of Mordechai and Esther, at the time when Haman seeks to destroy Israel and weighs out 10,000 bars of silver for the hands of those who do the work for Achashverosh, as it is written: "<b>And I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the stewards for deposit in the royal treasury</b> (Esther 3:9)". And what is written right there? "<b>Lived a Jew</b> (Esther 2:5)". 
"There was a Jewish man in Shushan the capital" -- [The word] 'man' (ish) teaches us that Mordechai was the equivalent of Moses in his generation as it says about [Moses] "and the <em>man</em>(ish) Moses was exceedingly humble." Just as Moses stood in the breach as it says (Psalm 106) "And He planned to destroy them if not for Moses who stood in the breach.." so to Mordechai as it says "He sought good for his nation and brought peace to all his people" Just as Moses taught Torah to Israel, so to Mordechai as it says [about Moses] "See, I have taught you laws," so to Mordechai as it says [that Mordechai sent out] "words of Peace and Truth" and it says "buy truth and sell it not" [about the Torah.] "And his name was Mordechai" -- When evil people are introduced in the text, they precede their names e.g. "Naval was his name" or "Sheba son of Bichri was his name." But the names of the righteous precede them e.g. "his name was Manoah," "his name was Kish," "his name was Saul," "his name was Elkana," "his name was Boaz," and in our text, "his name was Mordechai. This is to make them emulate their Creator as it says [about God] and My name, Jehovah, I did not make known to them. "Jewish" -- Why was he called 'Judean' if he was of Benjamin? Because he attested to the unity of God in the world as it says "[and Mordechai] would not kneel and would not bow] (therefore he was called a part of Judah which means 'to acknowledge God'). And [why] was he a contrarian that ignored the king's decree? Because when Ahasuerus  decreed that everyone should bow to Haman, Haman started wearing an idol so that everyone would bow to the idol, and when he saw that Mordechai refused to bow he became very angry. Mordechai told him "there is a Lord who is above all the arrogant. How can I forsake him and bow to an idol?" Thus, because he attested to God's unity, he was called The Jew i.e. the only Jew.  There are those who also compare him to Abraham. Just as Abraham threw himself into the furnace, came out alive, and caused people to recognize God -- this being what is referred to by the verse "and the souls they made in Haran" -- Mordechai also helped pepole recognize God in his own day as it says "And many people of the land converted to Judaism." [In conclusion] he attested to the unity of God and His holiness and was therefore called "the Jew".

"<b>Who had been exiled from Jerusalem</b> (Esther 2:6)": Rabbi Berechya and Rabbi Jeremiah and Rabbi Chiyya in the name of Rabbi Jose: "When Rabbi Yonatan and the Rabbis came to this verse which mentioned Nebuchadnezzar, they said: "Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones rot!" And why did they not say when they came to verses [that named him] in Jeremiah? Rather because Nebuchadnezzar was alive in the Book of Jeremiah and here he was dead".
"<b>He was foster father to Hadassah</b> (Esther 2:7)": why is she named Hadassah? Her smell was sweet and her taste was bitter. Thus Esther was sweet to Mordechai and bitter to Haman. "<b>For she had neither father nor mother</b>": Rabbi Pinchas and Rabbi Chama son of Gurion in the name of Rab: "And was she of unknown parentage, as it says: "<b>For she had neither father nor mother</b>"? Rather her mother was pregnant when her father died and when she was born her mother died". 
It is written: "And read it aloud to Joshua (Exodus 17:14)": this is one of four righteous men to whom a secret was given; two accepted it and two did not accept it. A secret was given to Moses and he did not accept it; a secret was given to Jacob and he did not accept it. A secret was given to David and Mordechai and they accepted it. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Jacob: "I will protect you wherever you go (Genesis 28:15)", but he "was greatly frightened", a man in whom the Holy One, blessed be He, trusted was frightened, as it is written: "Jacob was greatly frightened (Genesis 32:8)"? Rather, Jacob said: "Maybe when I was in the house of Laban the unclean I was affected by uncleanliness". Moses: "And read it aloud to Joshua (Exodus 17:14)": this says that you will die and Joshua will bring Israel into the land, as it is written: "I pleaded with Hashem at that time (Deuteronomy 3:23)". But on the contrary, a secret was given to David and Mordechai and they accepted it. David, as it is said: "Your servant has killed both lion and bear (1 Samuel 17:36)": David said: what am I so illustrious to kill these evil animals?" Rather, David said: "Perhaps some issue is going to threaten Israel and they will be delivered by my hand". Mordechai: "<b>Every single day Mordecai would walk about in front of the court of the harem</b> (Esther 2:11)". Did Mordechai say: "Can it be that this righteous girl be married to an uncircumcised man?". Rather he said: "A great issue is threatening Israel and they will be delivered through her hand". 
, but righteous peoples' names precede them e.g. "and his name was Manoach," his name 

[9]"When the turn came for Esther...And Esther won the favor of all eyes that that gazed upon her." Rabbi Judah says, Like this sculpture that is gazed upon by a thousand people and is pleasant for all of them. Rabbi Nehemiah says, They placed the Medean women on the one side, and the Persian women on the other, and Esther was more beautiful than them all. The Rabbis say, "And Esther won the favor of all eyes that that gazed upon her," both in the eyes of the upper worlds and the lower worlds, as you find (Proverbs 3: 4)  "Then you will find favor and a good name in the eyes of God and humans."

Chapter 7













Reish Lakish said:  At the time when the wicked Haman said to Ahasuerus, “Come, let us destroy Israel from the world”, Ahasuerus replied: You cannot overcome them, because their God does not forsake them at all.  Come, see what they did to the ancient kings who came before us who raised up their arms against them.  Those kingdoms were mighty and more numerous than we are.  And yet everyone who came upon them to annihilate them from the world and to scheme against them, they were annihilated from the world and became a lesson for all those who dwell on earth.  And we who do not have their advantages, how much the more so!  Enough of your chatter, recant this decree. Even so, the wicked Haman bothered Ahasuerus about the decree all the time and advised him with wicked schemes about Israel.  Ahasuerus said:  If so (if it really means this much to you), let’s consult the advisors and soothsayers. Immediately, he sent and gathered all the advisors from the nations of the world.  They all came before him.  Ahasuerus said to them:  Is it your will for us to destroy this nation from the world?  They said all at once:  Who is the one who wishes to do thus?!  For if you destroy Israel from the world, the world will cease to exist!  The world only exists because of the Torah which was given to Israel. (As it is written “As surely as I have established my covenant with day and night-- have I not ruled the heavens and the earth?” (Jer. 33:25).  And not only that, but all idolaters are called foreigners before the Holy Blessed one, as it is written, “Or if a foreigner who is not from your nation of Israel…” (1 Kings 8:41), and Israel is called close ones, as it is written “For the Children of Israel, God’s nation of close ones” (Ps. 148:14).  And not only that, but they are also called God’s children, as it is written, “My eldest son is Israel” (Ex. 4:22) and “You are children of the Lord your God” (Deut. 14:1).  And the Holy Blessed One is called a close one of Israel, as it is written, “God is close to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth” (Ps. 145:18).  There is no nation closer to the Holy Blessed One than Israel, as it is written, “(For what great nation has a god as close to it) as our God whenever we call upon Him?” (Deut. 4:7).) And if a person wants to raise a hand against the Holy Blessed One’s close ones and children, how can he survive?  For God rules over the upper and lower worlds and every living soul!  God has the ability to raise up and knock down, to kill and to give life!  Go and investigate what came to pass with the ancient kings who raised their hands against Israel-- what happened to them, like Sanheriv and Pharaoh? Immediately, Haman said to them:  The God who drowned Pharaoh in the sea and did all those miracles and wonders for Israel that you have heard about-- He is elderly and powerless!  Nebuchadnezzar was able to ascend and destroy His house, burn His sanctuary, and exile Israel and scatter them among the nations.  And where is his power and might?  He has aged!  As it says, “They say: The Lord sees not, the God of Jacob does not attend.” (Ps. 94:7) When he presented this argument, they immediately accepted his words and were of one mind to end Israel.  And they wrote proclamations and signed them. And thus was written in those proclamations: Greetings to you who are innumerable!  You surely know that among us there is a man who is not from our place but rather he is from the royal bloodline and from Amalek’s bloodline and he is among the greatest men of our generation -- and his name is Haman. He was asked a small, insignificant question about one of the nations in our midst, lowly among the nations but exceedingly haughty.  They seek our downfall and regularly curse the king. (And what is the curse they curse us with?  “God is King forever, nations shall perish from His land” (Ps. 10:16) and they further say, “To impose retribution upon the nations and punishment upon the peoples” (Ps. 149:7).) And they rebel against those who have done them good.  Come and see what they did to poor Pharaoh.  When they went down to Egypt, he greeted them warmly, settled them in the best of the land, sustained them in the years of famine, and fed them all the best from his land.  His palaces needed to be built and they were employed to build there. Nonetheless, he could not overpower them. And not only that!  They also treated him with deception.  They said, “To sacrifice to our God, we will walk a distance of three days’ travel (Ex. 5:3) and then come back.  If it is your will, lend us silver and gold and clothing.” And they lent their silver and gold and all the nice clothing they had and packed up untold numbers of donkeys.  Thus they completely ransacked Egypt-- as it is written, “They completely ransacked Egypt” (Ex. 12:36) -- and escaped. When Pharaoh heard that they were escaping, he went after them to reclaim his money.  What did they do to him?  They had a man with them named Moshe ben Amram.  With his sorcery he lifted some stick and cast a spell on it and hit the sea until it split.  They all entered on dry land in the midst of the sea and all of them passed through.  I do not know how they passed or how the sea dried up.  When Pharaoh saw this, he went after them to reclaim his money.  I do not know how they pushed him into the sea, but he and all his soldiers drowned.  And they did not recall the good he had done for them.  Do you not agree that they are ingrates?! And further -- what did they do to Amalek my grandfather?  At the time when they did battle -- as it says, “Amalek came and did battle against Israel at Refidim” (Ex. 17:8). And from where was Amalek coming?  Rabbi Keruspedai said in the name of Rabbi Yohanan, he was coming from the wicked Bilaam.  Amalek had gone to seek advice from him.  He said, “I know that you are a schemer and also a wicked planner and all who take advice from you succeed.”  Bilaam said to him, “Look what that nation did to Egypt, who had done so much good for them-- if that’s what they did to Egypt, what would they do to the other nations?!”  Amalek said, “How do you advise me?”  Bilaam said to him, “Go do battle with them.  If you do not do battle with them you will never overcome them, because they rely on the merit of their ancestor Abraham -- but you also are a descendant of Abraham who can rely on his merit!”  Immediately, he went to do battle with them. What did their leader Moshe do?  He had a disciple named Yehoshua bin Nun.  He was exceedingly cruel and had no mercy.  That Moshe said to him, “Choose men for us to do battle with Amalek” (Ex. 17:9).  I do not know whether those men he chose were sorcerers or warriors.  What did that Moshe do?  He picked up his staff.  I do not know what he did with it.  And when they met for battle I do not know what kind of spell he cast, but [the Israelites] let loose and [the Amalekites] fell before them.  Thus it is written, “Joshua subdued Amalek and his people by sword” (Ex. 17:13). They came to Sihon and Og, warriors of our land, before whom no creature can stand.  I do not know how they killed them.  They came to the kings of Midian.  I do not know how they killed them. And further -- what did that disciple of that Moshe do?  He brought the Israelites into the land of Canaan.  It wasn’t enough to take their land, but they also killed thirty one kings and divided up their land among the Israelites.  They were merciless -- those who they did not seek to kill were taken as slaves. They came to Sisera and his troops.  I do not know what they did to Wadi Kishon, which swept them up like ashes and carried them off and threw them in the great sea.  As it says, “The Wadi Kishon swept them away” (Judges 5:21). And they had a first king named Saul.  He led them to battle in the land of my grandfather Amalek.  He killed 100,000 soldiers in one day and he did not take pity on any man, woman, baby, or infant.  I do not know how he killed them.  And further, what did they do to Agag, my ancestor, on whom they had taken pity initially?  In the end, a man came from among them named Samuel and cut him up and fed his flesh to the birds of the sky.  As it says, “Samuel cut down Agag” (1 Sam. 15:33).  And I do not know why he killed him by this unusual method, as you have heard. And after that they had a king named David ben Yishai.  He slaughtered and annihilated all the kingdoms and did not take pity on them, as it says “David left alive neither man nor woman.” (1 Sam 27:11) And after him arose his son, Solomon.  He built a house for the Israelites and called it “The House of Holiness” (beit hamikdash).  I do not know what they had  inside it but when they were going to battle, they would go inside it and do sorcery. And when they came out, they killed and destroyed the world. And in spite of all of the good they had, they rebelled against their God.  And also their God had aged. So Nebuchadnezzar came and burnt their house and exiled them from their land and brought them among us.  Yet they still have not changed their repulsive ways.  Even though they are exiled among us, they mock us and our faith in our gods. So now we have all come to a consensus.  We drew lots to destroy them from the world, to decide at what time we should end them.  The lot fell for them in the month of Adar on the 13th day. Now, when these proclamations arrive to you, you are invited on that day to massacre and destroy all the Jews among you, from child to elder, babies and women in one day.  Thus there will be no shred or survivor left. When the proclamations were signed and given into Haman’s hand, he and all his crew were joyful.  They encountered Mordecai who was walking ahead of them.  Mordecai saw three children coming from school.  He ran after them.  When Haman and his crew saw that Mordecai was running after the children, they followed him to find out what he would ask them.  When Mordecai caught up to the children, he said to one of them, “Quote to me the verse you are learning.”  He said, “Do not fear sudden terror or the disaster of the wicked when it comes” (Prov. 3:25).  The second joined in and said, “I also learned Tanakh today and the last verse I ended on was: Hatch a plot-- it will be foiled!  Agree on an action-- it will not succeed.  For with us is God!” (Isa. 8:10) The third joined in and said, “Til you grow old, I will still be the same.  When you turn gray, it is I who will carry.  I was the Maker and I am the Carrier, I will carry and rescue you.” (Isa. 46:4) When Mordecai heard this, he laughed and was overjoyed.  Haman asked him, “Why are you so joyful about the words of these children?”  Mordecai said, “Because they have given me the good word that I shouldn’t fear from the wicked scheme you are plotting against us!”  Haman was angered and said, “I will lift my hand first against these children.” 

Chapter 8







<b>And Esther said to respond to Mordechai:</b> She said to him, "'Go and gather all of the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast for me - do not eat or drink for three days' - these are the 13th, 14th, and 15th of Nissan." He (Mordechai) sent to her, "Behold, in them is the first day of Pesach." She said to him, "The Elder of Israel, what is Pesach for?" Immediately, Mordechai understood and conceded to her words. That is [the meaning of] that which is written, "Mordechai passed and did like everything that Esther commanded him." There they say, that he passed  the holiday of Pesach  in  a fast. And about that anguish, Moredechai prayed to the Lord and said, "It is revealed and known before Your throne of Glory, Master of the worlds, that it is not because of pride of heart and from a haughty eye that I did not bow down in front of Haman, but rather form Your fear did I do this - not to bow down to him. As I was fearful in front of You to give Your honor to flesh and blood, and I did not want to bow down to anyone besides You. As who am I not to bow down to Haman for the salvation of Your people, Israel? For Your sake, I would have licked the shoes of his feet. And now, our God, please save us from his hand, and let him fall in the pit that he has dug and be trapped in the net that he hid for the feet of Your pious ones, and that this angering one should know that You have not forgotten Your promise that You promised us (Leviticus 26:44), 'And also with this; in their being in the land of their enemies, I will will not reject them and I will not abhor them to destroy them, to rescind My covenant with them, as I am the Lord, their God.'"   And what did Mordechai do? He gathered the children, and afflicted them from [receiving] bread and water and clothed them with sackcloth and sat them in the dust, and they were calling out and crying and involved in Torah [study]. And at that time, Esther was very scared because of the evil that had grown in Israel and she took off the clothing of her royalty and splendor and wore sackcloth, and she uncovered the hair of her head and covered it with dust and ashes, and she afflicted herself with fasting. And she fell on her face in front of the Lord and prayed and said, "Lord, God of Israel, who has ruled from the days of yore and created the world, please help Your maidservant, as I was orphaned without father or mother and am comparable to a poor woman who goes to beg from house to house; so do I beg Your mercy, from window to window in the house of Achasverosh. And now, Lord, please give success to Your maidservant  - this poor woman – and the flock of Your shepherding from these enemies that have risen against us, as You have no impediment from saving with the many or with the few. And, You, O Father of orphans, please stand to the right of this orphan, who trusted in Your kindness, and give me mercy in front of this man, as I feared him; and bring him low in front of me, as you bring the proud ones low."

Chapter 9




After Haman made the tree he went to Mordechai and found him sitting in the study hall with the children surrounding him wearing sackcloth, studying Torah screaming and crying. He counted them and found 12,000 (or 22,000) children. He put chains of iron on them and assigned guards to watch them. He said “Tomorrow, I will first kill these children and then hang Mordechai.” Their mothers brought them food and drink and told them to eat and drink today so they don’t die hungry. Immediately they put their hands on the Torah and swore by the life of Mordechai their teacher not to eat or drink, but rather to die fasting. Their moaning and crying went up to heavens and Hashem heard their crying. At that time, the mercy of Hashem was awakened and he got up from the seat of judgement and sat in the seat of mercy. He said what is this great cry that i hear, like sheep and goats? Moshe Rabeinu stood up and said, it is not sheep or goats, it is the children of your nation who are fasting and praying because tomorrow they will be slaughtered like sheep and goats. At that time, Hashem took the letters that he signed with the decree against the Jewish people and ripped them up. He then caused Acheshveirosh great discomfort, as it is written “At that night, the king couldn’t sleep” 

Chapter 10

[Esther 6:1] "That night the sleep of the king wandered" - Heaven's [sleep] wandered. This is the throne of the King of all kings, the Holy One , blessed be He, who saw Israel in sorrow. And is there sleep in relation to the Omnipresent? Does it not already say (Psalms 121:4) "Behold, he does not slumber, nor sleep, He guards Israel"? Rather, [God is only asleep] in a time when Israel is embroiled in distress, and the nations of the world are in peace, and therefore  it says, (Psalms 44:24) "Awake! Why do You sleep, O God?" "The sleep of the king wandered" - Ahashverosh, for he saw in his dream Haman drawing a sword to kill him. He panicked and awoke from his sleep. He said to his scribe: Bring me the book of chronicles, to read and to see what happened to him. And the scribes began, and they found the matter of Mordechai informing about Bigtan and Teresh. And once they said to the king, "Behold, Haman is standing in the courtyard," the king said, "What I saw in my dream was true! He has only come at this time to kill me."
[Esther 6:4] "To hang Mordechai on the tree that he had prepared for him" - It was taught: He prepared it for him, and about him it is said, (Psalms 7:13, Psalms 7:15) "And he prepared for him instruments of death, his arrows against the persecutors... A pit, he made it and dug it out, and he has fallen into the ditch he made."
"And Haman said in his heart..." (Esther 6:6) - The wicked are ruled by their hearts. "And Esav said in his heart" (Genesis 27:41). "The fool says in his heart" (Psalms 14:1). "And Yeravam said in his heart" (I Kings 12:26). "And Haman said in his heart" (Esther 6:6). But the righteous rule their hearts. That is as it is written: "And Chanah spoke upon her heart" (Samuel 1:12). "And Daniel decided upon his heart" (Daniel 1:8). "And David said to his heart" (I Samuel 27:1). And they are emulating their creator, "And God said to His heart" (Genesis 8:21).
He went to Mordechai: Once it was told to Mordechai that he was coming, he became extremely frightened. He was sitting and his students were in front of him. He said to his students, "My sons! Run away from here, so you will not be burned by my coals, for the wicked Haman is coming to kill me." They said, "If you die, we will die with you." He said to them, "If so, let us stand in prayer, and we will pass away in the midst of prayer." They finished praying. They delved into the laws of the commandment of the Omer, for that day was the 16th of Nissan, and on that day they would have been offering the Omer when the Holy Temple was still there. Haman came to them. He said to them, "What are you dealing with?" They said to him, "The commandment of the Omer. That's what is written: [Leviticus 2:1] 'And when you bring a grain offering to God...' There they said the laws of the handful [of the barley for the priest]." They showed it to him. "One of those would they do the handful from the Omer." He said to them, "The Omer, is it of gold or silver?" They said to him, "It is not of gold, nor silver, nor wheat, but barley." He said to them, "How much is its price, 10 Kantars [i.e. a lot]?" They said to him, "It's enough [to buy it] with but 10 Mon [i.e. very little]." He said to them, "Get up from the dirt! The 10 ma'ahs of yours will [surely] triumph over my 10,000 bundles of silver." Once [Mordechai] finished his prayers, Haman said to him, "Get dressed in the royal clothes." He said to him, "What, do you mean to disgrace the kingdom? Is there anyone who dresses in the royal clothes without getting washed [first]?" [Haman] went and sought a bathkeeper, but he could not find. What did he do? He wrapped his loins and brought him in to wash [in his private bath]. Once he left [the bath], [Haman] said to him, "Old man, put on this crown." He said, "What, you mean to disgrace the kingdom? Is there anyone who puts on a royal crown without getting a haircut [first]?" [Haman] sought a barber but couldn't find. What did he do? He went home and brought scissors, and he sat him down and was cutting his hair. He began to groan. [Mordechai] said to him, "What's with you that you're groaning?" He said to him, "Woe to the father of that man [me], who is letting go of his opportunity as king, to control everything, and has become a bathkeeper and a barber!" [Mordechai] said to him, "Is it any wonder? I don't know the father of that man [if he was] a bathkeeper and a barber in Kfar Krainos, but you indeed found his scissors!" [Haman] said to him, "Get up! Ride upon these horses!" [Mordechai] said to him, "I don't have the strength. I'm old!" He said to him, "And I'm not an old man?" He said to him, "Didn't you do this to yourself [i.e. this is your fault]?" He said to him, "Get up, I'll lean my neck, and you can step on top of it, and you will go up and ride, to fulfill for you that which is written, (Deuteronomy 33:29), 'You shall tread on their high places.'"

(Esther 6:12) "And Mordechai returned to the gate of the king" - This teaches that he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. Rabbi Chelbo said: Anyone who wears sackcloth and fasts should not remove it until his request is fulfilled.
