He completed the week: Meaning to say the days of feasting for Leah. Rabbi Yaakov [bar Acha] said, "From here [we learn], that we should not mix a joyful occasion with [another] joyful occasion, an obligatory joyful occasion with [another] obligatory joyful occasion. And hence, we do not marry women on the holiday, since we do not mix the joyful occasion of a wedding with the joyful occasion of the holiday of the festival. It is as it is written, 'You are to rejoice in your festival' (Deuteronomy 16:14) - and not in your wife."

"And when your children will say to you, What is this work for you?" (Exodus 12:26) At that time Israel was informed of bad tidings, for in the future their children would forget the Torah. [The child] is deliberately asking this way, meaning  [What is this work] for you and not for him[self]. He is one of the four sons that the Torah spoke about, one wise, one wicked, one simple, and one who does not know to ask. This [verse] is the wicked one who removes himself from the collective and denies his creator:

Verse 8

"You shall tell your son". This is the one who does not know to ask. The Torah spoke about four sons, and for each one the Torah gave a way to answer according to its situation. The world was created with four types of people, one wise, one wicked, one simple, and one who does not now to ask:
"You shall tell your son". I would learn that [you] should begin teaching the laws of Passover to [your son] from the first of the month. It was taught saying "on that day". If it must be on that day, I would learn [you] should begin [teaching] from the start of the day. It was taught saying "because of this" At the time when unleavened bread and bitter herbs are placed before you on your table. Lift them and say to [your son] "Because of this":
"The Lord did for me". Why is this said? Because the wicked asks what is this work for you? and since he takes himself out of the collective [by saying 'for you'] and he did not definitely say heresy, accordingly you take him out of the collective [but don't call him a heretic]. And say to him, "Because of this the Lord did for me" and not for you. For if you were [in Egypt] you would not have been freed. Meaning you would have already died in the three days of total darkness. (see Mekhilta 12:25)
