Introduction







Chapter 1

Chapter 1
From Adam to the flood was 1,656 years and this is their specification:Adam 130 years, Seth 105 years, Enosh 90 years, Kenan 70 years, Mahallel 65 years, Jared 162 years, Enoch 65 years,Metuselah 187 years, Lamech 182 years and Noah was six hundred years old etc. (Genesis 7:6) Enoch buried Adam and afterwards lived for 57 years, Metuselah lived until the flood. The time from the flood to the generation of the dispersion was 340 years. Noah lived for 10 years after the dispersion. Abraham our forefather was 48 at the time of the dispersion. Rabbi Yosi said "Eber was such a great prophet that he called his son Peleg (division) by divine inspiration as is written "in his days the land was divided" (Genesis 10:25)". If it was in the beginning of his [Peleg's] days: Wasn't Joktan his brother younger than him and he had 13 families which were afterwards dispersed? If it was in the middle of his days then the verse is confusing and verses only come to explain not to make ambiguous and therefore wouldn't use the phrase "in his day the earth was divided" unless it was the end of his days. Abraham our forefather was at the time he was spoken to by God at the pact between the halves 70 years old as is written "it was at the end of 430 years etc." (Exodus 12:41). After he was spoken to he went to Haran and stayed there five years as is written "and Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran" (Genesis 12:4). It comes out that from the time of the dispersion until Abraham left Haran was 27 years. "For 12 years [the five kings] served Chedorlaomer [of Elam] and for 13 years they rebelled and in the Fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came." (Genesis 14:5). The year Abraham left Haran was a year of famine and he went down to Egypt and stayed there for 3 months. He then went up and came to the terebrinths of Mamre that are in Hebron and this was the year that the Kings conquered it. He stayed there for 10 years married to Sarah until he married Hagar as is written "and Sarai the wife of Abram took Hagar the Egyptian as a midwife at the end of 10 years if staying in the land of Canaan. (Genesis 16:3). And it is written "and Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael" (Genesis 16:16). We find that Ishmael was 14 years older than Isaac. From the time of the dispersion to the birth of Isaac was 52 years. The settling in Sodom was 51 years of those years there was quite and serenity for Lot and his daughters 26 years. From the flood to the birth of Isaac was 192 years and this is the specification of those years: "And these are the chronicles of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old and he gave birth to Arpachshad 2 years after the flood" (Genesis 11:1) Arpachshad was 35 years, Shalach was 30 years, Eber was 34 years, Peleg was 30 years, Reu was 32 years, Serog was 30 years, Nahor was 29 years Terah was 60 years and Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born to him (Genesis 21:5). At the time of the binding Iaaac was 37 and Abraham dwelled in the land of the Philistines many days (Genesis 21:34). These were more years than he spent in Hebron which was 25 years, his dwelling in Philistine lands was 26 years. At the time Rebecca was born and Isaac married Rebecca when she was 14 (alternatively:3). Abraham buried his father Terah two years before the death of Sarah. Jacob served Abraham our forefather 15 years and Shem 50 years making it come out that Jacob served Shem 50 years, Shem served Metuselah 98 years and Metuselah served Adam 243 years.  It comes out that there are 4 among the first 22 generations and 7 men who overlapped an entire world (lived many generations) and these are: Adam, Metuselah,Shem, Jacob, Abram, Achyah, Achiyah of Shilo and Elijah and he is still alive.

Chapter 2

Chapter 2
Our forefather Jacob was 63 when he was blessed. Ishmael died at that time as is written, "Esau saw that Isaac had blessed...Jacob listened to his father...Esau saw [the Canaanite women] were bad [in the eyes of Isaac]...Esau went to Ishmael..."(Genesis 28:9). There seems no need for the verse to state "sister of Nebaioth." What do we learn from the fact that it says "sister of Nebaioth"? We learn that Ishmael died and Nebaioth [Ishmael's firstborn therefore] married off his sister to Esau. Jacob our forefather hid [from Esau] 14 years in the land of Israel and served Eber. Eber died two years after Jacob went to Aram-Naharaim (test this)
