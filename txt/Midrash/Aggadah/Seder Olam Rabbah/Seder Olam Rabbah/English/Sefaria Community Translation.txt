Introduction







Chapter 1

Chapter 1
From Adam to the Flood was 1656 years, and this is  their enumeration: Adam 130, Seth 105, Enosh 90, Kenan  70, Mahalalel 65, Jared 162, Enoch 65,  Methuselah 187, Lamech 182, and Noah was six hundred years old, etc." (Genesis 7, 6). Enoch buried Adam, and lived after him 57 years. Methuselah exhausted his days just before the Flood. From the Flood to the division [of languages] was 340 years. Noah lived ten years after the division [of languages]. Our father Abraham was at the division [of languages] 48 years old. Rabbi Yosei said: Eber was so great a prophet that he [preemptively] named his son Peleg ["division"], [aided] by the Holy Spirit. [Eber having foreseen what was to come] as it says "in his days the earth was divided" (Genesis 10, 25). 

Chapter 2

Chapter 2
Our forefather Jacob was 63 when he was blessed. Ishmael died at that time as is written, "Esau saw that Isaac had blessed...Jacob listened to his father...Esau saw [the Canaanite women] were bad [in the eyes of Isaac]...Esau went to Ishmael..."(Genesis 28:9). There seems no need for the verse to state "sister of Nebaioth." What do we learn from the fact that it says "sister of Nebaioth"? We learn that Ishmael died and Nebaioth [Ishmael's firstborn therefore] married off his sister to Esau. Jacob our forefather hid [from Esau] 14 years in the land of Israel and served Eber. Eber died two years after Jacob went to Aram-Naharaim. [Jacob] left and went to Aram-Naharaim and he was found by the well when he was 77 years old and he was in Laban's house for 20 years: 7 before he married any matriarchs, 7 from when he married in the Matriarchs and 6 years after the 11 tribes and Dinah were born. It comes out that all the tribes were born in seven years besides Benjamin. Each and every one each 7 months. He left Aram-Naharaim and came to Succoth and stayed there 18 months as is written "And Jacob went to Succoth" (Genesis 33:17). He left Succoth and went to Bet El and made 6 new encampments close to the place.

Chapter 6


On the seventh day after the Ten Commandments Moshe went up on the mountain, as it says "The Presence of the LORD abode on Mount Sinai, and the cloud hid it for six days..." (Shemot 24:16) This was in order for Moshe to purify himself. "On the seventh day He called to Moses from the midst of the cloud." (ibid.) "Moses went inside the cloud and ascended the mountain; and Moses remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights." (Shemot 24:18) On the 17th of Tammuz he  came down and shattered the tablets, "The next day Moses said to the people, “You have been guilty of a great sin. Yet I will now go up to the LORD; perhaps I may win forgiveness for your sin.” Moshe went back up on the 18th of Tammuz and pleaded for mercy on behalf of Israel, as it is written "When I lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights, because the LORD was determined to destroy you," (Devarim 9:25) At that moment, the Holy One once again viewed Israel with favor and said to Moshe to carve new tablets and to come up the mountain once again, as it says "Thereupon the LORD said to me, “Carve out two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain; and make an ark of wood." (Devarim 10:1) He came down on the 28th of Av and carved the second tablets, as it says "So Moses carved two tablets of stone, like the first, and early in the morning he went up on Mount Sinai..." (Shemot 34:4) He went back up on the 29th of Av and the Torah was repeated to him a second time, as it says "I had stayed on the mountain, as I did the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD heeded me once again: the LORD agreed not to destroy you." (Devarim 10:10) 'As I did the first time,' just as the first was a time of favor, so too the second were a time of favor- we can derive from this that those in the middle were a time of anger. He came down on the 10th of Tishre, which was Yom Kippur, and announced to them that they had found favor before God (Hamakom), as it says "Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Your own!” (Shemot 34:9) Therefore it was established as a fixed day and a remembrance for the generations, as it says "This shall be to you a law for all time: to make atonement for the Israelites for all their sins once a year..." (Vayikra 16:34)

Chapter 9

Chapter 9
They [the Israelites]--the entire congregation--came to the wilderness of Tzin in the first month, and the nation settled there, and Miriam died there and was buried there, and therre was not water for the congregation, and they gathered against Moses and Aaron (Numbers 20:1-2). When the well disappeared, it was Year 40, and it was the first of the month of Nissan, there in the episode when Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the King of Edom (ibid. 20:14), and Israel made [themselves] there for 3 months. Aaron the Priest went up etc., and Aaron was 123 years old when he died at the hill of the mountain (ibid. 33). When Aaron died, the clouds of glory disappeared, and the Canaanites came to make war against Israel. The Canaanites, King of Arad, heard etc. (ibid. 33:40), but what hearing did he hear? He heard that Aaron died, and he the greatest scout traveled among them, and the cloud of glory disappeared, for he had fought for them, and he came to fight with them, and they retreated seven stations and camped at Moserah, for it says "The Israelites traveled from Be'erot Beney Ya'akan towards Moserah; there Aaron died" (Deuteronomy 10:6). Did Aaron die in Moserah? Lo, did he not die at the hill of the mountain? Rather, starting from the location where Aaron died, they retreated seven stations, until they encamped at Moserah, and, from there they traveled towards HaGidgad, etc. (ibid. 10:7), and, from there, towards Be'er etc. (Numbers 21:16), which is the well to which they returned. The Israelites traveled and encamped in Avot, and they traveled from Avot and encamped in Iyyey Ha'avarim etc., and from there they traveled and encamped at the Wadi Zered, and from there they traveled and encamped beyond Arnon etc. (ibid.). There they fought with Sihon, and Israel struck him with the sword etc., and they turned and arose on the path of Bashan etc., "and the Lord said to Moses: 'Do not fear him etc.' and they struck him and his children etc." (ibid.). "The Israelites traveled and encamped at Arvot Mo'av etc." (ibid. 22:1). "It was after the plague etc." (ibid. 26:19), "for these the land shall be divided etc." (ibid. 26:53), and, when staying in Arvot Mo'av, the children retreated to their parents, and their parents retracted and gave inheritance to their children. Serah bat Asher was among those who came to Egypt and those who left it. [She was] from those who came to Egypt, as it is written, "And Serah their sister" (Genesis 46:17), and [she was] from those who came to the Land [of Israel], as it says, "And there was the daughter of Asher, Serah" (Numbers 26:46). And Yokheved was among those who came to Egypt and those who left it. [She was] from those who came to Egypt, as it is written, "And the name of the wife of Amram was Yokheved, daughter of Levi etc." (ibid. 26:59). Ya'ir son of Menasheh and Makhir son of Menasheh were born in the lifetime of our ancestor Jacob, and they died after the death of Moses our teacher, and Novach was among those born in Egypt, and he died after the death of Moses our teacher, and he was buried beyond the Jordan, but there was no man among them left etc. (ibid. 26:65).

Chapter 12



Chapter 13

Eli led Israel for forty years, and the day Eli died, he forsook his tabernacle, as it is said, “He rejected the tent of Joseph” (Psalm 78:67), and “He gave His strength into captivity” (Psalm 78:61). And the Ark of the Lord was in the field of the Philistines for seven months. The Philistines called and said (1 Samuel 6:1-2). The men of Kiriath-Jearim came and took it, and it was from the day the Ark rested (1 Samuel 7:2). Subtract from these seven years the time David reigned in Hebron over Judah, which remained there for thirteen years, and subtract eleven years for Samuel himself and two years for Samuel and Saul. It was from the day the Ark rested (1 Samuel 7:2). At the beginning of these twenty years, the Tabernacle was brought to Nob. Although the Ark of the Lord was in Kiriath-Jearim, in Nob they offered sacrifices for thirteen years and for seven years in Gibeon. At the end of twenty years, David moved the Ark of the Lord from Kiriath-Jearim to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite, and the Ark of the Lord stayed in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months (2 Samuel 6:11). From this, we learn that Obed-Edom was blessed only because of the Ark of God. <br>Saul was one year into his reign (1 Samuel 13:1). Samuel said to Saul at the time of his anointing, “You will go down before me to Gilgal” (1 Samuel 10:8). Saul went down in the first year and struck the Ammonite king, and the Israelites anointed him. In the second year, he went down and did not keep his promise. Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the Lord” (1 Samuel 13:13). In that chapter, David was anointed, as it is said, “And the Lord said to Samuel, ‘How long will you mourn for Saul?’” (1 Samuel 16:1). Then Samuel took the horn of oil (1 Samuel 16:13), and he was twenty-nine years old. And Saul was hostile towards David (1 Samuel 18:9), and it is said, “The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul” (1 Samuel 16:14). In that chapter, Nob was destroyed, and they came to Gibeon. <br>All the days of Samuel the Seer were only fifty-two years. It is also said, “Eli the priest sat on the seat” (1 Samuel 1:9), and she was bitter in soul (1 Samuel 1:10). In that chapter, he was appointed as a judge, and it is said, “And he judged Israel forty years” (1 Samuel 4:18). Thirteen years remained. Subtract one year for the intercalation, eleven years for Samuel, and one year for Saul. Thus, fifty-two years. Samuel died about four months before Saul's death, as it is said, “And the number of days that David stayed in the field of the Philistines was days and four months” (1 Samuel 27:7). And afterward, David inquired of the Lord, saying (1 Samuel 30:8). Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, was forty years old when he began to reign (2 Samuel 2:10), and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. The kingdom of Israel was therefore nullified for five and a half years. All the elders of Israel came to King Hebron (2 Samuel 5:3). In that chapter, David was anointed again, being thirty years old at his anointing (2 Samuel 5:4), and he reigned for forty years.

... Rabbi Yossi says, "A merit ends up being on a day of merit and a punishment ends up being on a day of punishment. For you will find to say that when the First Temple was destroyed, that day was the culmination of the Shabbat, and it was at the culmination of the sabbatical year and it was during the watch of Yehoyariv and it was the ninth of Av. And likewise with the Second. And in both this one and that one, the Levites were standing on the platform and reciting song. And what song did they recite? 'He will make their evil recoil upon them' (Psalms 94:23)."
