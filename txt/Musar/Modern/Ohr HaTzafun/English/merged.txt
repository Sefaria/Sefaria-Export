But behold, if we examine [it], for example, with the claim against our mother Sarah that she listened from the opening of the tent, we will find that it it very, very slight. What did Sarah's ears hear? The conversation of the angels that were sent from God, may He be blessed, to announce to her that a son would be born to her, which are prophetic words. And there is a certainly a very high level in this, and only a prophet is fit to hear words like these from the mouths of supernal angels. And not only that, but the words were concerning her, that she would bear a son. And the listening was also unintentional; for the ears are one of three things that are not in the control of a person (see Tanchuma, Toldot 12). And indeed Sarah did not descend from her level of extra understanding that was given to her beyond that of a man as a result of this. For behold even after this story, it was said to Avraham, "everything that Sarah says, listen to her voice" (Genesis 21:12). And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (see Rashi there), "We learned [from this] that Avraham was secondary to Sarah regarding prophecy." So it then comes out that there was a blemish here that is beyond our ability to comprehend. And it is only the Holy One, blessed be He, who examines hearts and evaluates thoughts, who discovered that there was some lack with this, such that she did not reach her full perfection, according to her level.

...next after a greeting with love and respect among all the Kaddish group, it is enough in the shadow of the wisdom of the great Talmud house where Torah and prayer are held.
