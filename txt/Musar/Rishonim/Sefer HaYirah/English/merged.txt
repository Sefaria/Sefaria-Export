Sefer HaYirah

<small><i>Sefer ha-Yirah,</i> the Book of Awe, of our Pious Rabbi Yonah Gerondi of blessed memory. To show the people of God the way of God and the deeds which they may do all of their days, when they lie down and when they rise up, when they go and when they come, so that it may be good for them and their children, in this [world] and in [the world-to-] come. <sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Superscription in Me’ah She’arim edition. Vilna edition reads: “That was made by our completely pious Rabbi Yonah Gerondi, may his memory be for a blessing.” Moriah edition reads, “of the Genius, the pious Rabbenu Yonah of Gerondi, may his memory be for a blessing.”</i></small><br><br>I.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Arabic-numeral line numbers follow the edition of מקור היראה, by R. Benjamin Moshe Zilber (Zilber ed.). The Roman-numeral section numbers follow the edition containing the gloss of R. Moshe Negrin (Negrin ed.).</i> <b>It is good</b> that a man<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">גבר</i> should take up the Yoke [of the commandments] in his youth.

Now he should remember his Creator in the days of his youth.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Zilber, Moriah read “כחו,” “his strength.” Mea She’arim reads בחורותיו, “his youth.” Vilna gives כחו in round brackets, בחורותיו in square brackets, and resolves the variation thus, “and so it must be read. From the written language, Ecc. 12:1. “Remember your creator in the days of your youth.”<br>Makor ha-Yirah, “I have learned in Duties of the Heart (R. Bachya Ibn Pakuda) which explains that the distinction between today and tomorrow is the same difference as between youth and age, and this is the language in the chapter on making personal accounting (חשבון הנפש) #13 therefore put yourself to this length as much as you are able to pay what you owe to the Creator every day (which means every day you remain (lit., lengthen) upon this earth one should pay back, relieve, and complete today what you owe to the creator, etc.) and do not put off to tomorrow what can be done today lest it should be weighty for you to separate (i.e., die) if you arrive tomorrow and it shall be hard from this if it shall come to your end and closed off for you and your error shall end for the world is like a market that will be gathered and afterward separated and he that pays the reward is happy and he that causes loss feels sorry for it therefore the wise one (Solomon) says “remember your creator…” Thus far his words. [Zilber goes on to cite R. Yonah’s own work, The Gates of Repentance, II:32, “...when one defers repentance, his transgressions age and lose their sting and he does not worry over them as in the beginning.” (The Gates of Repentance, trans. Shraga Silverstein. Feldheim: New York, 1967. 73.)</i>
Each and every day he should strengthen and be encouraged in the commandments of the Creator of the World,
he should bring His love into his heart<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">There are several 3ms pronouns in a row here – the translation tries to keep which refer to God and which refer to man straight by use of capitalization.<br>Makor ha-Yirah: a long exigesis arguing on the basis of Rambam <i>sefer mitzvoth gedolot</i> that to bring love into one’s heart means to act like Abraham in his great love for his fellowmen.

And thus he may set the fear<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The first occurrence of the word “יִרְאָה” . There are several translation options available: fear, awe, or reverence. "Awe" and "reverence" would both be legitimate choices, and would sound more euphonious to a modern audience, especially one familiar with Abraham Joshua Heschel and his idea that radical amazement is the foundation of faith. But "fear" seems more in keeping with Rabbeinu Yonah's medieval sensibilities and closer to what he actually meant.</i> of the Rock [of Israel] upon his face, and

and lower his spirits and lower his stature and the height of his eyes,
let him go [along] bent [over], regretting the sins of his youth,
and always crying over them.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Although pietist, this is not a chassidic spirituality. This halachah stands in sharp contrast to the teachings of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, who would say, מצוה גדולה היא להיות בשמחה.</i>
So let him keep with all his strength from sinning more in secret, and let him not do it in dark deeds. And so he will be beloved and treasured in the eyes of the Creator and all who see him will rejoice in him.
II. <b>These are the things that a man may do and live life everlasting by them</b>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Boldface in Moriah edition.</i> Every morning when he awakens from his sleep, let him tremble and be startled and seized by the fear of the Creator when he remembers the loving kindness<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">חסד.

The מ"א wrote get up immediately not only so (דוקא) but rather stay (שהה) a little as is spelled out (?) in BT, Gittin 70. Therefore our rabbi wrote precisely (דוקא) that he should not sit in bed in a lazy manner but before he gets up from his bed it is good or well that he should tarry a little in his sleep. (אוהל יוסף) Now it seems to me that where our rabbi wrote to sit (יושב) its meaning is is like “to dwell in praise” (יושב תהילות) or “so you dwelt in Kadesh (many days)” (Deut. 1:46) which is the language of delay.</i> but rather with speed and vigor let him rise immediately.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">See e.g., Shulchan Aruch1:1.

Or, if he needs to go to the service of the prince<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Zilber ed., Moriah, Mea She’arim all have המלך, "the king"; i.e., the gentile authorities.</i> let him get up and not be lax. Otherwise, they may heap abuse upon him.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The verb עלל does not occur in the hiphil according to Jastrow, but in the kal it means “abuse.”</i> Or [just] to find favor in the eyes of the prince.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Again, Zilber ed., Moriah, Mea She’arim read המלך, the king.</i> How much the more so in the service of the King of Kings of Kings, the Holy One Blessed be He, so he must take heed to rise with speed, vigorousness, and awe, else he may be late to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Makor ha-Yirah: (at his n. 13) [He gives a list of halachic authorities for early rising:] M. Avot 4. (but quoting R. Yehuda b. Teimah, M. Avot 5:20); Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 1:1, Tur 1:1, 2:1, R. Moses Isserles (mappah, gloss on Shulchan Aruch 1:1). And the ב"ח draws an inference that despite that he agrees about rising early, he should get up before the light of the morning.<br>So it is in the older edition, and our rabbi writes here three which are really six reasons which by their hand a man should wake up to conquer his natural inclinations to get up immediately: (a) fear of a man and respect due the man, (b) financial gain and loss, (c) fear and respect of the king to find favor in his eyes. And not to connect solidifying (?) that to write of the most stubborn of them to learn, how much the more so to rise immediately because of the King of Kings, the Holy One Blessed be He. Since just as knowledge has no conclusion, feeling has no conclusion, and each one gets up according to his own marker and level just as one who is a prince and a head does not connect himself to the accounting of fear and honor of man … but this should be understood… thus as written in Duties of the Heart, 30 accountings but for each accounting a man has it in his ability to reverse the accounting from one extreme to the other and to bring himself close to the Blessed Creator. And on the other hand this one must explain always excite a man’s good impulse over his evil appetite, and there is no more room to continue here.</i><br>III<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Negrin ed. includes a whole section here labeled (ג) which does not appear in the other four eds. It is in square script, as part of the text, not the Negrin gloss.</i> And how good and pleasant it is if he should rise before the light of the morning to supplicate himself before his Creator and to direct the hours of the different night-watches dividing the night into three equal parts<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Lit., “which are one-third of the night and at the end [of that one] the second third of the night and to the end of the night…”</i>, since these are the times the Holy One<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">הב"ה = הברוך הוא</i> is reminded of the destruction of the Temple and the exile of Israel among the nations and the prayer that a man may pray at that hour about the destruction and the exile is desired and his supplication falls before the Omnipresent One, whether he lengthens or shortens<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">אחד המרבה ואחד הממעיט This phrase appears in the regular text at line 54 in the context of a discussion of prayer.</i> [his prayers] so long as he directs his heart (BT <i>Berachot</i> 5b) with his supplications, for better to say little with intention than much without intention.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">AMEN (III). Negrin does not discuss the injunction to rise swiftly. However, he recommends that as soon as a man rises, he should learn the Torah portions of the Binding of Isaac (Gen. 22) and of the Manna (citing the Tur). Learning the Binding of Isaac, he explains will lessen God’s harsh judgment of us (in mystical thinking, by sympathetically linking us to the meritorious actions of our ancestors) and learning the portion of Manna will mystically invoke blessing and prosperity upon us, too. He mentions that it is not necessary to learn the Binding of Isaac on Shabbat because on that day God’s judgment is dormant and God feels only loving mercy (רחמים). Instead, one should learn the 10 commandments for the sake of mystically unifying the disparate aspects of God. For the same reasons, he recommends learning the portions of the Torah involving the daily sacrifices in the ancient Temple, as a way of symbolically offering them ourselves, and thereby mystically invoking God’s love.</i>
Now, he should think to do all of his deeds for the sake of Heaven. And he should, as much as he is able, go by the way of the sages. But let him be humble.
Let him not get out of bed naked but only sit up. As Rabbi Yossi explained, “In all my life the inside of my tunic did not see the beams of my house.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Makor ha-Yirah: BT, Shabbat 118b. Shulchan Aruch 2, Be’ur ha’Gra (Vilna Gaon). That is, he would not pull his undershirt off over his head, thereby turning it inside out and exposing it to the rafters above. We see the value of modesty here, an important value underlying this entire work. See also Leviticus Rabbah 20:11!</i> Instead, let him take his undershirt and put his head and arms in it, so that when he gets up he will be covered. And he should not say, “Why, here I am in the inner rooms of a dark house, who will see me and who will know it is me?”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Vilna: [יודעני] (וידעני): (and will know me) [will know me]. Zilber ed.: (יועדני)[יודעני] [will know me] (will designate me) (?). Moriah: יוֹעִדֵנִי, will designate me? Meah She'arim: מעדני, will designate me.<br>Makor ha-Yirah: (with respect to the textual variance): In the <i>Tur</i> it is written, מי יועדני ומי רואני, “who will designate me and who will see me?” and it is written in the ב"ח (=בדפוס חדש?) new edition, but this language is to say, ‘who will know it is me, why, there is no man with me and even if there were a man with me, who would see me in the middle of the night?,’ as in the verse in Isaiah, “(…and their works are in the dark,) and they say ‘who sees us?’ and ‘who knows us?’” (Is. 29:15). Not like in <i>sefer ha-Yirah,</i>who will designate me, from language of witnessing. So far his words. And on the basis of this explanation it is possible to say what our Rabbi meant by [the apparent redundancy of] “inner rooms” and “dark house”: “will know me,” in the inner rooms and “wil see me” in the dark house.</i> for the whole earth is full of His glory. Before Him, the darkness is like light.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">AMEN (ה): The reason for this is that the man’s limbs hint at things of the upper worlds, as Job wrote: (19:26) “…from my body, I would see God.” Even the [sign of] the holy covenant [i.e., the circumcision] and therefore it is not fitting to reveal them, for the honor of God is in the secret of his limbs.<br>Negrin further comments on the issue of modesty (his ו’): the inner spark (הפנימי) is pure, but the outer side (הצד החיצון) is susceptible to impurity. Therefore it is not fitting to make the inner outer and the outer inner.</i>
Now he should put on his clothes. He should have a tallit katan<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">That is, a four-cornered, fringed ritual undergarment meant for wearing all day.</i> and let him put it on underneath his outer garments<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Negrin ed. תכף בקומו כדי שלא ילך ארבע אמות בלא ציצית, “when he gets up in so that he should not walk four cubits without ritual fringes...”</i> for the crux of the commandment of wearing fringes is always remembering when getting dressed.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Zilber ed. deletes the phrase כי עיקר מצוה and simply says כי לזכרון המצוה נתנה, “because the commandment was given for memory.”</i> Because the commandment was given for remembering, and so that a man should not turn away after the stubbornness of his heart or after the gaze of his eyes which cause his body to sin. But this way will not be found unless he should go on the way in which the naked things <sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 18, <i>Acharei Mot</i>. One will not stray into sin unless he goes on a way where he will find temptations.</i> are found.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">AMEN (ח): Negrin quotes from Zohar, Shelach Lecha 83:331 -- apparently Tallit gadol and tallit katan are symbolic.</i>
Therefore let him dress himself immediately without a blessing if he has not washed his hands. But it is good to be strict to wash his hands first<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">AMEN (ט): The explanation of “first” -- that he touch his clothes according to the custom of the first Chassidim [i.e., in Hasmonean times] (See note כ) who would prepare vessels of water by their bed in order to wash their hands and purify them and not handle their clothes with their impure hands, as mentioned in the Zohar, Bereisheet p. 36:146, and in such manner they would bless before doing it.<br>AMEN (כ) Negrin continues at his XX: “The rabbi ends here, but I need to explain: Know that it is forbidden for a man to walk 4 cubits with impure hands. The first chassidim would prepare a ladle of water by their beds so that when they stirred in the night they washed their hands while they were still in bed in order that they not contaminate their clothes with impure hands.”</i> and to bless after he has done it.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">עובר לעשייתוֹ – high flown Hebrew in original.</i>
Now it is necessary to wrap himself in a tallit<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., the more familiar four-cornered ritual garment.</i> in a standing position.
And it is good for that same tallit katan to be a kind of cloak<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">כעין סרבל</i> for there is no shaking with this.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">פִּיקפּוּק. Makor ha-Yirah: It should be as big as a kind of cloak so that it should be appropriate for [completely] wrapping oneself in, for any kind of shaking, as explained in the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (ב"י) § 8 and see in Shulchan Aruch (__?) 8:10.</i>
Now let him put on his right shoe first and the left one afterwards but tie the left one [first] and afterwards the right, as our rabbis said, “Awe of heaven coming out of all of them,” to fulfill the words of the Mishnah and the words of R. Yochanan: just as his prayers, thus his shoes: just as his prayers on the left, so his shoes on the left.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Makor ha-Yirah: BT <i>Shabbat</i> 61a; SA __ 2:4.</i>
And as soon as he gets up to walk on the road he should bend his height and he should cover his head for the <i>shekhinah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the divine indwelling feminine presence of God on earth.</i> is above his head.
And therefore it is correct to cover his head and not to go bareheaded.
Now, let a man go and and let him take care of his needs<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">lit, “check himself.”</i> in the bathroom.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">AMEN (XIV). Negrin sets forth a prayer that one entering the bathroom should recite, calling on the ministering angels who accompany each person to guard him and help him: “be clean, O honorable holy ministering angels of the most high, guard me, guard me, help me, help me, wait upon me as I enter until I leave, for such is the way of men.” (Tur, top of § 3). He then discusses the need to repeat “guard me,” and “help me.”</i>
And there he should be modest.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Negrin ed., “Now let him be modest in the bathroom and not expose himself until he sits; afterwards he may expose in front of him two hands-breadths and behind him one hands-breadth; and a woman, behind her one handsbreadth and and in front of her, nothing.” (emphasis mine.)</i> He should not expose himself but for a hands-breadth in front of him and two hands-breadths behind him. And for a woman, one hands-breadth behind her and in front of her, nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">AMEN (XV). From here, one must be strict not to expose even his arm when he lays tefillin because all the limbs of a person hint at great and awesome things and there is not praise like modesty.<br>Once again, Negrin shows the kabbalistic idea that the limbs of a person reflect aspects of the divine being.<br>Negrin continues: When he sits, he should face south with his back to the north. The south is associated with [the sefirah of] Hesed, the characteristic of Abraham, as is said, “loyal love (חסד) to Abraham” (Micah 7:20 following Koren), and his back to the north, as is said, “out of the north the evil shall break forth,” (Jer. 1:14, Koren). And he should not sit between east to west, since the Shekhina is in the west and since everlasting memory לזכר בעלמא … is between east to west it is forbidden in whatever place may be. And by my opinion the secret [meaning] of east to west the crown of Tiferet, in order not to divide them, and it is enough to understand.<br>Makor ha-Yirah: But see, in the Shas (the Talmud) BT Berachot 62b, 23__ it is explained the opposite, (as we see in the Negrin ed.), in front of him two hands-breadths because of spouting urine. And behind him one hands-breadth, and so it turns out that there is no distinction between a man and a woman as to the matter of behind. But according to the edition of our rabbi goes the <i>Bet-Yosef</i> and the <i>Tur, Orach Chaim</i>, and the scrivener’s error has falllen into the books, in front instead of behind and behind instead of in front. Now the words of our rabbi do not mention but in the new printing (?) הב"ח writes that since even in Sefer ha-Yirah the version is so, it is difficult to dismiss as a scrivener’s error, one falling in all the books but rather it is certain that the versions in the <i>shas</i> ibid, and distinguish between a man and a woman, it appears that as to the woman the stricture is greater. But in the new printing (?) it explicates a different reason: to choose the stricter of the two versions. And see in the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> in the name of the Latter [sages]. (אחרונים)</i>
He should not urinate standing up in case there be sprinkles splashing upon his legs and he should appear like one whose urinary canal is mutilated. Rather, let him stand in a high place or urinate in dust. But if he does urinate standing up he should take care lest he take hold of the membrum virile – rather, [he should hold it] from the corona on down the lower side<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">lit., “to the side of the earth.”</i> even if he be married.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Evidently, a man should never masturbate, nor even touch the top of his own penis.<br>Makor ha-Yirah: BT <i>Niddah</i> 13a; Shulchan Aruch __ 3:13,14. “Even if he be married…” see the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (ב"י) which brings our Rabbi’s words (as) the source for the <i>Tur</i>, which forbids (it (masturbation)) even for a married man, and where the <i>Beit Yosef</i> explains the characteristic of piety he means according to our Rabbi, and thus it is decided in the Shulchan Aruch. [He appears to disagree with the <i>Taz</i> (Turei Zahav?)] <i>Rambam</i>, ch. 21 of Laws of forbidden sexual entry: it is not permitted to a married man except to urinate; <i>Be’ur ha’Gra</i> (Vilna Gaon); Shabbat 41a (R. Abahu was married.)</i> For the punishment for it<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">That is, masturbation.</i> is so great as to destroy the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">lit., “bring the flood to the world.” Presumably capital punishment, or he may refer to a divine punishment.</i> He must strengthen himself and sanctify himself, even in what is permitted to him. And thus our holy Rabbi: in all his days he did not put his hand under his belt.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">BT, Shabbat 118b.</i>
When he sits to relieve himself he shall sit and uncover and cover and stand.
But he should not strain<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Vilna and Zilber ed.: יפצר. Moriah: יִפְצַּר and Mea She'arim: [יְצַעֵר] (יַפְצֵּר). All mean "strain."</i> himself hard in case he should tear the glands of the rectum and be in danger.
He should wipe off with the left (hand) but not with the right because he points out the tropes of the Torah and eats with it.
He should inspect himself very well afterwards for his guts and his bowels need to bless the Creator always, as is said,<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Vilna, Moriah, Mea She'arim have this quotation from Psalms here; Zilber ed. omits it.</i> “Bless the ETERNAL, O my soul, and all my innards His holy name,” (Ps. 103:1).

Others לברכוֹ, to bless Him.</i>
Let him take care lest he soil his clothes, whether with urine or with excrement.
If he can, he should have two pairs of pants: one that he wears at the time of prayer only for the sake of being the most clean when praying, but if he cannot, he should be careful not to soil his<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Me’ah She'arim has: [שֶלּוֹבֵש](שֶלּוֹ), (his)[that he wears].

He should always wash them to take away the stains of filth from off of them.
XX.<br>He should wash his hands completely.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Lit., "with cleanness."</i> with water if he has it. He should wash them exceedingly well and recite the <i>al netilat yadayim</i>, “concerning the washing of the hands” blessing over them.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">AMEN: (A continuation of the note above) Now know that when a man sleeps at night the soul goes out from his body and immediately שורה the unclean spirit upon his hands, and the reason [for] the hands is that they are against two arms of teh world/eternal which seize powers of impurity and therefore the שורה upon the hands. Now the one who walks four cubits with impure hands is liable for death from Heaven since he brought to the Other in his hands and about him it is said, “The tents of robbers prosper, and they who provoke God are secure; they who bring their God in their hand.” (Job 12:6 following Koren). Who they who provoke God?

He should come to the synagogue and say when he enters, “As for me, in your great love I shall come to your house, I shall bow down to your holy temple in fear of You,” and he should sit in his seat.

First, he says that the words and letters must be carefully separated because each and every word and letter in the Torah is a hint of the sefirot and the upper worlds. One should sing “Baruch she’amar” beautifully because it contains 87 (פ"ז) letters, which equals “his head is most fine gold” ( ראשו כתם פז) (Song of Songs, 5:11). Such is Ashkenazi practice, established by the men of the Great Assembly (c.f. M. Avot 1:1) But it is important not to add to the 87 letters because it would detract from the kavvanah. They also say it while standing in all lands of Ashkenaz and Tzarfat. “Baruch she’amar” contains 10 “baruch…” statements, according to the 10 statements by which the world was created (i.e., “And God said, ‘let there be light,’ and there was light...”) He continues through the early parts of the morning prayer service, mentioning “kol ha’neshamah t’hallel yah” and “yishtabach” mentioning the Talmudic requirement to recite praise with song and melody before praying (the Amidah) [BT Berachot 32a]. He adds that the air is full of evil spirits and that prayer will protect against them. Later in this lengthy comment he says that when reciting פותֵחַ את ידיך in the Ashrei, one should pronounce ידיך as יוּדיך (“your yuds”) as the secret meaning of the two letterֿs yud (perhaps in the abbreviation of the divine name יְיָ) that draw down the great light and the holy flow into the world. This is also the meaning of the 3 letters yud in the [beginning of each phrase of the] priestly blessing. And from Ashrei through “l’olam va’ed” there are 613 letters, so that by reciting them correctly it is as if one had fulfilled all 613 mitzvot. The ten psalms that begin and end with “halleluyah” are compared to praise of a king. But if one cannot recite them all, he should say at least: ברוך שאמר, תהילה לדוד, הללו אל בקדשו which accompish something of the same purpose. Reciting shirat ha-yam will merit seeing the messiah, as when Israel first recited it they were crowned with the same crown that God will in the future crown the messiah. It has 18 verses corresponding to the 18 vertebrae in the spine [a concept seen elsewhere in Sefer ha-Yirah] adn the placement of “then Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the shore of the sea” next to “so Moses sang” hinting at the death of the nations but the life of Israel. He discusses the need to pronounce the letter Kaf in מי כָּמוֹךָ to avoid language of blasphemy or else it would sound like “Michah is like you, O God” asserting that the Biblical prophet Micah secreted away the pronunciation of the divine Name. Negrin segues into how responding forcefully enough to the prayers such as “amen” or “y’hei shmei raba” or “baruch hashem hamevorach” causes unfavorable heavenly judgments to be ripped up. He goes so far as to say that the letters of the prayers should be said with as much exactitude as the letters of the Torah. Eventually, he concludes by saying each and every letter is like a candle corresponding to one of the 248 positive mitzvot (the metaphor comes from “the commandment is a lamp and Torah is light.” Prov. 6:23)</i> [one] needs to separate them, this one from that one, and so with “ [adonai] elocheichem emet” and [such] as come out with these.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">There are siddurim that actually place stars over such letters to make clear the need to enunciate where the letters would run into one another.</i>

<b>When he recites</b><sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Boldface in Vilna and Moriah.</i> the Sh'ma he should be very careful to utter with his lips and hear with his ears all 248 letters that are in it.

And with each and every one of the three [divine] names that are in the first line<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">The first line of the Sh'ma has three occurrences of the divine name: יי ,אלוקינו and יי the second time.</i> he should lengthen them until he thinks [of] past, present, and future but he should not lengthen the aleph ("one").
And he should not hurry the [letter] chet [in the word echad] as if to read it with a chataf.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">That is, one should not shorten the ח' in the word אחד to read אֶחָד as if it were אֶחֳד.</i>
And he should lengthen the [letter] dalet [in the word echad] until he considers in his heart that the Creator of the world is king above and below, in heaven and on earth, and the four winds of the world, from east and the west, north and south, and the great depth, and the 248 limbs that are in him.
But if he just cannot direct his heart so much (have so much kavvanah) let him direct himself to Hashem, who is now our God, in the future to be one.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">C.f. <i>Aleynu lishabeach</i>, “on that day the age-old dream shall be fulfilled: He shall be one and His name shall be one.” This is a very interesting law, for Rabbenu Yonah, who seems so dour and so exacting, to be so understanding of and lenient here toward human nature. Also very interesting temporal theology.</i>
And each time he mentions the Specific Name<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">That is, the four-letter name of God.</i> let him think on it the meaning of its reading: that He is Lord of all.
[When he recites] “With all your heart,” he will need [to meditate] on two [things]:<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">בשני יצרך</i> the good appetite and the evil appetite. “And with all your soul,” [is] even taking your soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., even martyrdom for the sanctification of the Divine Name.

“Upon your heart,” thus far, the intention of the heart and the crux of the acceptance of the Yoke of the kingdom of heaven, and even when walking on the road, being directed until he arrives at “upon your heart.”
But even from the first verse, he has fulfilled his obligation.<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Another surprisingly lenient rule.</i>
From here on he should read according to his usual way with as much intention as he can.
And for when he arrives at “bind them for a sign upon your hand” he should touch the arm-tefillin and “for totafot between your eyes,” he should touch that of the head.
And when he comes to “and look at it” he should look at his tzitzit .
Plus, he should enunciate [the letter] zayin in [the word] Tizkaru ("you shall remember");<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">לְמַעַן תִּזְכְּרוּ וַעֲשִׂיתֶם | אֶת-כָּל-מִצְוֹתָי, at the conclusion of the recitation of the Sh'ma.</i>
