Chapter 1



Verse 1

"In the beginning God created" - Rabbi Isaac said: The Torah should not have begun except from "This month is to you" (Ex. 12:2) which was the first commandment that the Israelites were commanded. And what is the reason that He opened with "In the beginning"? So that if the nations of the world would say: "you are thieves, that you conquered for yourselves the lands of the seven nations" they would respond to them "all the land is the Holy One Blessed Be He's, and He gave it to whomever it was fit in his eyes; and at His will He gave it to them, and at His will, He took it from them and game it to us." And this is a tale in the words that Rabbeinu Sholomo [Rashi] wrote in his commentaries. And one can question it, because there is great need to begin the Torah with "In the beginning God created" for it is the root of faith; and one who doesn't believe this and believes that the world is primordial, he is an apostate and has no Torah whatsoever. And the answer, it is because the work of creation - it is a deep secret, is not intelligible from the verses, and will not be understood by its students except through the received tradition up until Moses our Master from the mouth of God [lit. "The Strength"], and those who know it are required to hide it. Therefore Rabbi Isaac said that beginning of the Torah doesn't require "In the beginning God created" and the story of what was created on the first day, and what was done on the second day and the remaining days, and the lengthy telling of the creation of Adam and Eve, and their sin and punishment, and the story of the Garden of Eden and Adam's exile from it, for all this cannot be understood with full understanding from the texts. And all the more so the story of the generation of the Deluge and the Division, for their is not great need of them. And it would be sufficient for the people of the Torah without these texts, and they would believe in the included that was reminded to them in the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:10): "For in six days God created the heavens and the earth, the sea and all they contain, and He rested on the seventh day", and the knowledge would remain to the few individuals among them, as law passed to Moses from Sinai, along with the Oral Law. And Rabbi Isaac gave reason for this, that the Torah began with "In the beginning God created" and the story of the whole topic of creation until the creation of Adam, and made him ruler of the work of His hands and all that was given over beneath his feet, and the Garden of Eden - which is the best of all the places created in this world - became established for his dwelling, until his sin drove him from there. And the people of the generation of the Deluge, by their sin were driven from the entire world, and the righteous one among them alone was spared, him and his sons. And their descendants, their sin caused them to be scattered in places and planted in lands, and they captured for themselves the places according to their families among their peoples, as the opportunities arose to them. If so it is appropriate, that when a people continues to sin, it will be destroyed from its place and another people will inherit his land, for this is the law of God in the land from always. And all the more so with what is told in the text that Canaan is cursed and was sold as an eternal slave, and it is not appropriate that he inherits the choicest places of setllement, but it will be inherited by the slaves of God, the seed of he who loved Him, like the issues which is written (Psalms 105:44): And He gave them the lands of nations and the labor of peoples they shall inherit so that they shall keep His laws and guard His instructions. That is to say, He chased out those who rebelled against Him, and settled in His servants, so that they would know that by serving Him they possess it - and if they sin against Him, the land will vomit them up as it vomited up the nation before them.

"In the beginning" - Rashi wrote: If you would like to interpret it, do so literally, like so: "In the beginning of the creation of the heavens and the earth, the earth was chaotic and void and dark, and God said, 'Let there be light.' Thus, all is directed towards the creation of light. Rabbi Avraham [Ibn Ezra] interpreted it [the Torah's first verse] in a similar manner, but corrected [Rashi] in that the [usually conjunctive] vav in the word "and the earth," does not serve a purpose, and there are many such examples in Scriptures. The reason for this: because in the beginning of the creation of the firmament and the land, there was no civilization. Rather it [the land] was entirely chaotic and empty, covered with water. "And God said, 'Let there be light!'." In his opinion, light was all that was created on the first day.

"And the reason for the words 'the woman you gave to me'-in other words, she gave me from the tree, and i figured that whatever she would say to me would be for my benefit and help. That is why in the punishment God says "because you listened to the voice of your wife", that you should not have listened to her advice in lieu of following my command. This is what the rabbis called 'ingratitude'. For we would want to explain that Adam answered God 'you caused me to fail in this area, that you gave me a woman to help and she ended up advising me to sin'. "

Verse 1

"and Elokim remembered Noah and all the animals" - The remembrance of Noah was because he was righteous and whole and God established a covenant to save him. And, Noah includes his offspring who were with him there, they (the offspring) were not mentioned because they were saved through his (Noah's) merit.  However, the remembering of the domestic and wild animals is not because of some merit. This is because of all the possessors of souls, only mankind has merit and fault. Rather, the remembrance of them (domestic and wild animals)is that He remembered His own holy words that He spoke and the world came into being. Additionally, the desire to create the world which He had, came before Him and He desired the existence of the world and the species He had created in it. He therefore acted to take them out, as they could not persist in the ark. He did not remember the birds and the fish because the remembrance of the land mammals included them.

Verse 1

"Go, yourself" - "For your benefit, and for your own good, and there I will make you into a great nation. Here you will not merit children. And what's more, I will let the world know all about you." That's the language of Rashi.  But there is no need, for the structure of the language is like that: "The rain is over and gone (itself)." (Songs 2:11); "I will go (myself) to the mighty..." (Jer. 5:5); "Arise, and cross  over (yourselves) over wadi Zered."; and many more like that.  But our rabbis (in Talmud Yoma 3:, 72:) came up with an interpretation from what is written (in Deut. 10:1): "Make for yourself an ark of wood," and "Make for yourself two silver trumpets," (Num. 10:2). Since the work doesn't really belong to them, it should have said something like what it says about the tabernacle: "Make the tabernacle." ( Exod. 26:1)
From your land and from your birthplace - Rashi wrote: But did he he not already leave from there with his father? And Rabbi Abraham explained that God already said to Avram, ‘Go forth from your land,’ and so this is restating what was already said in Ur Kasdim, and it was there that He commanded him to leave his land, his birthplace, and his father’s house there.   And this is not correct. Because if this were so, the point of the journey would be Avram’s leaving his father’s house on God’s command, and Terach would just be accompanying him out of his own personal desire.  But the verse says, “Terach took Avram his son” (Gen. 11:31), which shows that Avram was following his father, and it was his father’s idea that they leave Ur Kasdim to go to the land of Canaan.  And furthermore, the verse (in Joshua 24:3) says, “I took your father, Abraham, across the river, and led him across the whole of the Land of Canaan,” where it should have said, “I took your father, Abraham, from Ur Kasdim, and led him across the whole of the Land of Canaan,” for it was from there he was taken and there he was commanded.

And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem - I will tell you a general princible to understand all these passages about Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and is a great concept.  THe Rabbis mention it in a brief way. And said they (Tanhuma I): Everything happened to our forefathers is sign for the children. and therefore the Scriptures extend in the story the journeys and digging wells and other events. One can think that these are unnecessary details with no purpose. But all of the events come to teach about the future, for when an event occurs with one of the Patriarchs they can contemplate it and can derive its implication and decree for their descendants....

Verse 7

And the reason "to the Lord who had appeared to him" -- that he acknowledged honored God and offered a thanksgiving offering to him when He appeared to him, because until this point God had not appeared to him and had not acknowledged him in an appearance or vision.  When it is said to him, "Go for yourself from your land," [this is] in a dream or [through] the holy spirit......

Verse 10

And there was famine in the land (Gen. 12:10) – behold, Avraham went down to Egypt due to hunger, to live there temporarily in order to save his life in the days of drought, and the Egyptians exploited him without cause to get his wife, and the Holy One of Blessing avenged them with great afflictions, and brought him out from there with cattle, silver and gold, and Pharaoh had commanded men to send him. And it is a hint from (Avraham), since his children went down to Egypt because of hunger to live temporarily in the land, and the Egyptians did evil to them and took their wives, as it says (Exodus 1:22) And every (baby) girl you shall let live, and the Holy One of Blessing avenged them with great afflictions until they were taken out (laden) with silver and gold and sheep and cattle, with many possessions, and they (Egyptians) pressed them to be gone from the land. Not a single incident that befell the father didn't befall the children. And this matter is explained in Bereshit Rabbah 8:6: "Rabi Pinchas said in the name of Rabbi Oshaya - The Holy One said to Avraham: ‘Go and conquer the way for your children.’ And you find that everything that was written regarding Avraham was also written regarding his descendants: regarding Avraham it is written and there was famine in the land, regarding Israel it is written (Genesis 45:6) this is already two years of famine in all the land." And you should know that our father Avraham committed a great sin unintentionally, in which he brought his righteous wife to stumble into transgression because of his fear of getting killed, and he should have trusted the Name to have saved him, his wife and all that was his, because Elohim has power to help and to save. Also his going out from the land - of which he had been commanded at the beginning - due to famine was a transgression that he committed, because Elohim would have saved him from dying (even) in a famine. And because of this deed it was decreed that his seed would be in exile in Egypt under the hand of Pharaoh.

Verse 2

"And Avram listened to the voice of his wife"- the Torah does not say "and he did this" rather that he listened to her voice, to hint to us that even though Avram wanted desperately to have sons, he would not act without the permission of his wife. Even once acting he would not plan on building a family with Hagar rather Sarah. All of his intent was to do Sarah's will so she would be pleased with her family and maidservants.
And it said as well "Sarah took" to teach us that Avram didn't rush to take Hagar rather that Sarah took her and gave her to Avram. "To Avram as his wife"--to hint to us that Sarah never gave up from being with Avram, never removed herself from him--he is her husband and she is his wife, but she wanted the Hagara would also be his wife...this was done by Sarah to honor her husband (that he would not have a child just with a concubine rather a wife).

He was born to him in his old age. And Onkelos translated it as, "A son of wisdom he was to him". What he had learned from [the yeshiva of] Shem and Ever, he handed over to him. This is the interpretation of Rashi. And said Rabbi Abraham [ibn Ezra], a son of old age that was born to him in old age, at the age of ninety-one years, and his brother Benjamin [was also] called a "little child of his old age" (Genesis 44:20). But this is not true to me, because Scripture said (above) "and he loved Joseph more than all his sons for he was a child of his old age", but all of his sons were born in his old age, and Issachar and Zebulun were not one year or two years older than Joseph. And seems to me that the custom of the elders was that they take one of their young sons to serve them, and he would lean on his arm and would never be parted from him, and he called him "a son of his old age", for he served him in old age, and here Jacob took Joseph for this thing and was always with him, and therefore he did not work with the sheep when they grazed in far away places. And Onkelos said "A son of wisdom". He wanted to say that he was a wise and knowledgeable son to his father, and he had understanding like elders. In the case of Benjamin, where is says] "child of his old age", [Onkelos] translates as "son of his old age" that it was not written here that said "he was a son of his old age," but [rather] it said "he was to him", which means in his eyes [i.e. that this was the way he perceived him as being wise]. As our sages say (Genesis Rabbah 84:8), what he had learned from [the yeshiva of] Shem and Ever, he handed over to him. This is to say that he [Jacob] told him [Joseph] the wisdom and secrets of the Torah and found him to be an intellectual and a master of the secrets [of the Torah] as if he was an elder and had many years.

"Swear to me, and he swore" - Jacob was not suspecting that his righteous beloved son would defy his father's word, about which [Joseph] already promised that "[he] would do according to [Jacob's] word". [Jacob] did this in order to strengthen his position versus Pharaoh, for he might have not given permission Joseph to depart and say, "take your brothers and servants, and go [to the land of Canaan]"; or he might have wished for the prophet [Jacob] to be buried in Egypt as an honor and merit. Therefore, [Jacob] adjured [Joseph] so that [Pharaoh would feel] it was improper [to make Joseph] violate his oath. (Also, because of the oath, Joseph would put extra effort into it.) And so it happened, as [Pharaoh] said (50:6), "Go and bury your dead, as you have sworn".
