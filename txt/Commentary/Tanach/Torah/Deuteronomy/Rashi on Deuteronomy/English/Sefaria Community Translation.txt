You made me weak like a female, for I was worried over you, and you weakened my hand. For I saw that you no longer yearned to come close [to G-d], with love. Would it not have been better to learn direct from the Almighty rather than myself?

You may take her as your wife: The Torah speaks only in deference to the wicked inclination, for if God would not permit her [to him], he would take her illicitly. However, if he does marry her, he will ultimately come to hate her, as it says afterwards, "If a man has [two wives]" and ultimately he will father from her a wayward rebellious son. This is why these topics are placed one after the other.
