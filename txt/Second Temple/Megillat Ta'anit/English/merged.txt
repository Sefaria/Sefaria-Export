This is what is written “And David conquered the stronghold of Zion which is the city of David.” (Shmuel I 5:7) this is the place of the karaites (?) right now. Since they were troubling the people of Jerusalem and they were unable to go out or in except at night, they declared the day they were driven out as a holiday.

<i>The Tzaddukim had a book of laws - "These are stoned, these are burned, these are killed by sword, these are stangled."  When it was written, a person would ask (what to do) and go look in the book.  If you asked them, "How do you know this one is stoned or burned or decapitated or strangled?", they wouldn't be able to bring a proof from the "the instructions given to you" (Devarim 17:11).  Because we don't write laws in a book. ...

On the day that Herod died, it was a day of joy because Herod hated the sages. Joy is before the Almighty when the wicked are removed from the world, as it is stated: 'And also the hand of the Lord was upon them to destroy them.' It is written: 'And it came to pass when all the men of war had completely died from among the people.' And it is written: 'And the Lord spoke to me, saying.' Similarly, it is said: 'A good man brings forth good tidings.' And he said: 'So too, the king commanded Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him, and he died.'

<b>On the twenty fifth of the month is Channuka, eight days on which one does not eulogize</b> 
because when the Greeks entered the Temple they defiled all the oil there. When the hand of the Hasmoneans was made strong and they defeat the Greeks, they checked (in the Temple) and only found one jar of oil sealed with the mark of the High Priest which remained undefiled. Though there was only enough in it to light for one day, a miracle occurred through it and they lit the Temple lamps from it for eight days. The following year they decreed these to be eight days of celebration. And what justification did they see for making Channuka eight days? Wasn’t the dedication (channuka) which Moshe did in the wilderness only seven days? As it says “And you shall not leave the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for seven days…” (Vayikra 8:33) And it says “The one who brought his offering on the first day was…” (Bamidbar 7:12) and on the seventh day Ephraim made his offering. So too we find at the dedication which Shlomo made that it only lasted seven days, as it says “…for the inauguration of the altar they made seven days, and the feast seven days.” (Divre HaYamim II 7:9) So what reason did they see to make this dedication eight days? In the days of the kingdom of Greece the Hasmoneans entered the Temple, built the altar, plastered it with plaster and for seven days they were preparing the vessels for service. The re-dedication done by the Hasmoneans it to be marked for all generations. And why is it a practice for all generations? They fixed it when they came out from a narrow place into broad spaces, and they said praises and thanksgiving, lighting lamps in purity. Since the Greeks had gone into the Temple and defiled all the vessels, there was nothing with which to light. When the Hasmoneans were victorious, they brought seven skewers of iron, covered them with tin and began to light.

<b>On the thirteenth of that month is the Day of Nikanor.</b>
Nikanor, general of the Greek kings, when passing through to Alexandria daily would wave his hand against Jerusalem and the Holy Temple blaspheming, insulting and disparaging them, saying ‘when will she fall into my hands that I may destroy her?’ When the hand of the Hasmoneans became strong they went down amongst his soldiers and killed until they came to those closest to him. They cut off their heads and chopped off their thumbs and big toes, and then cut off his head, chopped off his limbs and hung them across from the Holy Temple. They said ‘the mouth that spoke arrogantly and the hand which waved against Yehudah, Jerusalem and the Holy Temple – let this revenge be done to them. They made the day that they did this a day of celebration.

One final word:
And these are the days on which we fast from the Torah, and all those who fast on them neither eat nor drink until the evening. On the first of Nisan, the sons of Aaron died. On the second [of Nisan], Miriam the prophetess died and the well was hidden. On the twenty-sixth [of Nisan], Joshua son of Nun died. On the second of Iyar, Eli the priest and his two sons died and the Ark of the Covenant was captured. On the twenty-ninth [of Iyar], Samuel the prophet died and all Israel mourned him. On the twenty-third of Sivan, the first-fruits were nullified from going to Jerusalem in the days of Jeroboam son of Neat. On the twenty-fifth [of Sivan] Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha and Rabbi Ḥanina the vice high priest died. On the twenty-seventh [of Sivan], Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradion was burned with a Torah scroll. On the seventeenth of Tammuz, the tablets were shattered and the daily-offering was nullified and Apostomos burned the Torah and an idol was placed in the Temple. On the first of Av, Aharon the high priest died. On the ninth of Av, it was decreed that our ancestors would not enter the land, and the first and second Holy Temples were destroyed, and Beitar was taken and the city was plowed. On the eighteenth [of Av], the western light was extinguished in the days of Ahaz. On the seventh of Elul, those who brought bad reports about the land died in a plague. On the third of Tishri, Gedaliah son of Aḥiqam son of Shafan and the Jews who were with him in Mitzvah were killed. On the fifth of [Tishri], the twenty people from [the northern kingdom] Israel died, and R. Akiva son of Joseph was confined in the prison-house and died. On the seventh of [Tishri], sword and famine was ordained on our ancestors. On the tenth of [Tishri, Yom Kippur, there] is atonement for the matter of the Calf. On the sixth of Marḥeshvan, they blinded the eyes of Zedekiah king of Judah and slaughtered his sons before his eyes. On the seventh of Kislev, Jehoiakim burned the scroll that Baruch son of Norah wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah. On the eighth of Tevet, the Torah was written in Greek in the days of King Ptolemy, and darkness came over the earth for three days. On the ninth of [Tevet] our rabbis did not write why [we fast]. On the tenth of [Tevet] the king of Babylon placed his head against Jerusalem to destroy it. On the eighth of Shvat, the righteous people in the days of Joshua son of Nun died. On the twenty-third of [Shvat], all Israel gathered against the tribe of Benjamin and against the concubine in Gibeah and against the idol of Micah. On the seventh of Adar, Moses our master died. On the ninth of [Adar], a fast was established for the debate of the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel. These are the fast days which were received upon Israel from the Torah. And our rabbis also decreed that some would fast on Mondays and Thursdays on account of three things: the destruction of the Temple, the Torah that was burnt, and blaspheming the name. And in the future the Holy Blessed One will turn them to joy and happiness, as it is said, "And I will turn their mourning to joy, and comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow." (Jeremiah 31:12). Rabbi Elazar said Rabbi Ḥanina said, students of the sages increase peace on earth, as is said, "And all your children are learned of God, and great is the peace of your children." (Isaiah 54:13). "May there be peace in your walls, tranquility in your palaces. For the sake of my brothers and friends, let me speak, please, peace in You. For the sake of the house of the LORD our God let me wish your good." (Psalm 122:7-9). "Great peace to those who love Your torah, they will have no obstacle." (Psalm 119:165). "The LORD grants strength to His people; the LORD bless His people with peace." (Psalm 29:11).
Finished is the tractate of the scroll of fasts!
