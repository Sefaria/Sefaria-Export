Editor's Preface



The Foundations of Chasidut



[Chapter 1



[Chapter 2
















Chassidut's answer to this question is the 'shattering of the vessels (<i>shevirat hakelim</i>).' Taken from the Kabbalah, this concept has a special explanation in Chassidut. The great Kabbalists explained the idea of the shattering of the vessels in this way: The vessels could not withstand the flow of light that streamed into them without limit, so they shattered in the same way that the life force of a person is not able to withstand sudden great joy, such that it breaks apart.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">See Shaarei Gan Eden by R. Yaakov Koppel, etc.</i>However Chassidut explains the matter of the shattering of the vessels in an deeper internal way. The essence of the idea of the Chassidim in this case is fully understood by its comparison to the new findings about thought.
