<b>I will sustain My covenant between Me and you:</b> It is known that the right is called the trait that impacts, and it is called the trait of kindness, as it is written (Psalms 89:3), "The world is built by love." For the world was created with the trait of kindness. Whereas the left is called the trait of power which restricts and limits the impact. So the world was created according to both of them. Well-known are the words of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, that there was an expansion of creation with no end, until the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked [it], and said, "Enough!" And that is the limiting force. And behold that between the trait of the right and the trait of the left, there is a middle trait which is the determinant, and it is called the righteous one, foundation of the world. It receives from them and regulates the impact in proper order. And that is called the establishment of the covenant (<i>brit</i>), as is well-known. And behold each source of impact must have a corresponding receiver. For without that, it cannot impact. So it is certainly fitting that the receiver should be in the form of the source of impact, meaning right, left and the middle trait. And this is [the meaning of] that which is written, "I will sustain My covenant between Me and you." And that is the secret of, "it is a sign between Me and the Children of Israel." And the enlightened one will understand. And alongside, I will explain that which the Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote about the intention in the eighteen blessings (of the daily prayer) with the last letters of, "Your name is great, and You are fitting to praise (<i>lecha naeh lehodot</i>)," which is the [Godly] name, <i>kaf, hey, tav</i>, see there: It appears that the reason is because the last three last [blessings] is where the unification is made. And there must be protection that the impact not be lost, but received. That is why he wrote to have intention for this name, which is good for pregnancy. As this name is the limiting force, and it comes out from the last letters of, "behold you are pregnant and will give birth (<i>hinach harah veyoladet</i>)" (Genesis 16:11), see regarding this in another place. And behold that the Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote that in the blessing, "Place peace" (the last of the eighteen blessings), one should have the intention for the name of the Lord (the Tetragrammaton), together with the name, God (Elohim) interspersed. That is <i>alef, yod, lamed, hey, hey, vav, yod, hey, mem</i>, see there. And this is with the secret of the unification that includes the source of impact with the receiver, and likewise the name of the Lord with the name, God. And the order of joining the beginning of the name with its end is <i>alef-mem</i> (spelling, <i>em</i>, mother), such that the receiver should form the impact in the form of an embryo. So it is called, <i>em</i>; which leaves the letters,<i>yod, lamed, hey</i>, which has a numerical count of <i>mem, hey</i> (a mystical name of God), through which unification is done. And their other letters, <i>hey, vav, yod, hey</i>, together with <i>yod, lamed, hey</i> is 71, corresponding to [the members of ] the Sanhedrin, which sat in a circular half threshing floor. And the one who understands will understand.

In the gemara <b>at ohr to the 14th we search for chametz</b> I already explained that the chametz is the yetzer hara [inclination to selfishness] as the Rambam explained that chametz comes from the expression for stealing, from the verse (Isaiah 1:17) 'aid the wronged', and therefore chametz alludes to the yetzer hara, since whoever goes according to the advice of the yetzer hara steals from their [soul] root. Therefore one needs to burn the chametz on erev Pesach and to make preparations so that the great holiness that is revealed in night of Pesach will infused itself upon oneself, since Pesach comes from the expression leaped and skipped because in all festivals holiness does not come to a person in one moment, a person needs to continue the holiness with the prayers of Night, Morning and Afternoon. But on Pesach, the holiness comes to a person in one moment, like the expression to skip, as we explained, and therefore there is the need for preparations, since even though the shining light comes, even though it does come, a person needs to cleanse oneself so as to be able to receive the shining light. For example,the sun, even though it shines strongly, the windows need to be open, because if they are closed the sun cannot shine within the house. And in all festivals one needs to continue the holiness on oneself, through the prayers, as the verse says 'that you will call them in their time, a holy convocation' (Leviticus 23:2) - that is one needs to call [to convocate] the holiness. But on Pesach the shining light needs to come in one moment, because 'in haste you came out of Egypt'(Deuteronomy 16:3) Chipazon [haste] its letters are chet"peh [and] zayin"nun, that is to say all the holidays the holiness comes from the Holy One as male [zayin] and female [nun], groom and bride; that is, the more the bride (the people of Israel) adorns herself all the more the groom (the Holy One) comes closer and closer to her. But on Pesach, because Israel needed to get out from Egypt, because were they to stay there for yet another moment they would not have been able to get out of there, and this is why the redemption needed to be in haste [chipazon] that is to say covered [from chupah] from the way of the male [zayin] to the female [nun], so the shining light comes in a skip and a leap but regardless [that fact] obviously a person needs to prepare oneself, as explained above in the simile of the sun and the windows.
Or one may say - at evening [ohr] of the 14th we check for chametz by the light [ohr] of a candle. It is explained that the essence of chametz is the yetzer hara, as explained above, and as explained in the gemarah "who prevents? The yeast in the dough". And behold the essence of the chametz is the yetzer hara, which comes because the building-block of humans is desire and pleasure of sex, as David Hamelech peace be upon him, says: " Indeed I was born with iniquity; with sin my mother conceived me" (Psalms 51:7), therefore a person needs to sanctify oneself at the moment of sex since the more one sanctifies oneself the more one gives to the fetus a holy soul, since from the holiness of sex a yetzer tov comes to the fetus. And from desire and lust comes the yetzer hara, therefore one should diminish one's desire so as to diminish the yetzer hara of the fetus, and the yetzer hatov can conquer with ease the yetzer hara. And regarding this it is written "at evening [ohr] of the 14th we search for chametz by the light [ohr] of a candle - that is to say, by the light of one's soul, since "the candle of Hashem is the soul of a person", since candle [ner] is the acronym of "neshamah, ruach" and "nefesh, ruach", which is appropriate for searching and burning the chametz completely.




<b>All places where one does bring chametz in, need to be searched</b> meaning, one needs to search every place where their yetzer harah, which is the chametz, usually resides. And this place is different for each and everyone: the one whose yetzer resides on finding fault on others, God forbid, or whose eyes are always turned to that that should not be seen, God forbid, they need to search, and destroy, and completely return from that path so they won’t do it anymore, and if they return from what did in the past in a complete return (teshuvah) obviously the Holy One of Blessing will forgive them. And in places where one does not put chametz in, there is no need to search ~ and it appears to me that this is a remez, hint: there are those who do not notice their own behavior, but only the behavior of other people. And the warning of our mishnah is regarding this: and in places where one does not put … there is no need to search, meaning, one should not investigate other people’s behavior, but should investigate their own, and fix their own behavior.
<b>Those (holes) that are too tall for the hand to reach, and those that are lower than nine inches do not need to be searched</b> here we read it as a remez,  hint: one should never say ‘I won’t be able to check all my misdeeds and sins, because I don’t remember them all!’ To this is the reference Holes that are too tall for the hand to reach – if you don’t remember them, there is no need to search there. Yet regarding those one does remember, one needs to search, to fix and to return. And those one does not remember immediately will be cancelled, since the Holy One of Blessing will say ‘if s/he had remembered their earlier misdeeds and sins, obviously s/he would regret them and turn from them, just as s/he regrets and returns from those s/he remembers.
<b>Every person has to sweep his rooms before checking for chametz</b> this is a hint: every person needs to clear their thoughts on the 13th of Nisan, and get ready on the 13th so they can begin the search at night. This is because if one does not clear their thoughts beforehand, and wants to search suddenly, out of the blue, obviously they won’t see in themselves any chametz, and they will say “I am perfectly righteous!” One only needs to clear their thoughts beforehand, and obviously they will find chametz there.

<b>You stand:</b> In the Yalkut (Yalkut Shimoni 940:11) - Moshe said to them, "Do you want to stand [firm] in the world? Occupy yourselves with Torah." What is written above? "So you are to take care regarding the words of this covenant" (Deuteronomy 29:8). And afterwards, "You stand." To here are its [words]. As behold we always read this section before Rosh Hashanah, since it hints to all of the Jewish people [that] you stand and are prepared and positioned before the Lord, your God, from the great to the small, such that each person of Israel must ready himself before the great and awesome day of judgement. And this is, as has become the custom, to arise at the [last] watch [of the night] to say penitential prayers the week before Rosh Hashanah. That is that when Rosh Hashanah comes out on Thursday, it is sufficient to [begin] on the Sunday before it. But if it comes out on Tuesday, we then precede to arise from Sunday of the past week. And behold the Magen Avraham forced himself to give a reason and wrote that there needs to be four days before Rosh Hashanah so that there be ten days of fasting. To here [are his words]. But one can also say [another] reason. It is because the world was created on the twenty-fifth of Elul. For Adam, the first man, was created [on the first of] Tishrei and he was [then] judged. So the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, "Behold this is a sign for your children, etc.," as if found in Midrash. And even though we say on Rosh Hashanah, "Today is the creation of (<i>harat</i>) the world," and the Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote that <i>charat</i> is an expression of pregnancy (<i>hirayon</i>) - and, if so, it is possible that it implies that the creation of the world was [only] in a hidden thought, just like the pregnancy of one's mother - nevertheless, the truth is like its simple meaning, that the world was created in Tishrei, and like the words of the Midrash mentioned above. It is only that the aspect of Kingship (<i>Malkhut</i>) was in an aspect of pregnancy and hidden thought. So His Lordship and Kingship was not recognizable until the Jewish people went out of Egypt in Nissan. And that is the 'beginning of the year for kings,' meaning the time though which it was revealed that God is the only King over the whole world. But the truth of the matter is that the world was created in Tishrei, but its beginning was on the twenty-fifth of Elul. Hence the Sages, may their memory be blessed, ordained to arise at the [last] watch [of the night] to say penitential prayers in order to sanctify the days of the creation up until the sixth day [of creation], which was the day sanctified [with] the creation of man - Rosh Hashanah. For everything  is aroused in its time. And we have already prefaced earlier that the angels that said, 'What is man that You should remember him,' were prosecuting angels that are aroused every year on Rosh Hashanah, since the Jewish people did not fix their ways or their misdeeds towards God. 'And, if so, should You not act measure for measure and - God forbid - not be called the God of Israel?' So behold the Children of Israel below fast and sound the alarm below with the sound of the shofar and accept upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of God through repentance and good deeds, until the kindness of God, may He be blessed, is aroused to bring out their righteousness like the light. So He [then] shows their merit in front of the angels above and justifies them in the trial. That is until they all concede that He is our God, and we are His people, Israel. And so is it fit to be always. So they all agree about all the goodnesses, salvations and redemptions. And all of it comes to us because of our faith, since we trust in His great mercy, and His great kindness. So we bathe and cut our hair in honor of the day of judgement. And they 'rejoice in trembling' and in the arousal of repentance in joy. And the words of our master, our teacher and rabbi, the Gaon, the Master, the Rabbi Dov Ber (of Mezeritch) are well-known - that the explanation of the writing for life in the book is that it is etched into the thought of a person. For the wicked one, when he remembers his iniquities, he becomes afraid and trembles and he is not in control of his heart to repent to God - 'this one is inscribed immediately for death.' This is a sign for the matter that [these] thoughts confuse him and weaken his heart with fear of death. But this is not the case with the righteous - even though they squirm and tremble from the fear of God, may He blessed, there are certain of His salvation and His kindness. So they strengthen themselves and repent to God, and 'they are immediately inscribed for life.' So the inscription for the good is etched into their hearts. And even though some thoughts come to [the righteous] that remind him of his iniquities that signal to the prosecution above, [righteous people] nevertheless steer their minds to the greatness of repentance and the abandonment of sin from that day onwards, and about the acceptance of the Kingdom of Heaven, and to have faith in His great kindness; and they focus on [God's] name [made of letters, the numerical count of which is] 72, which indicates the kindness of the Creator, may His name be blessed. To here are his [words]. And behold we draw forth the great kindness that is called Long (<i>Arikh</i>) to the aspect of the God of Israel, which works with us measure for measure. That is why the trumpet blasts in the Temple would be short and the shofar blasts would be long (<i>ma'arikh</i>). As the trumpets (<i>chatzotzerot</i>) hint to the expression of half forms (<i>chatzi tzurot</i>), as I have written in another place - meaning either the whiteness or the redness. As the full form is called that which is made up of whiteness and redness, as it is written (Song of Songs 5:10), "My beloved is clear-skinned and ruddy. "And we do not want half forms on Rosh Hashanah, as I wrote above, but rather the appearance of a man that includes everything and the aspect of the God of Israel, and to draw forth the aspect of <i>Arikh</i> with the shofar. And the Yalkut hints to this also - Moshe said to them, "Do you want to stand, etc? Occupy yourselves with Torah." For the root of the Torah is the twenty-two letters, which hint to the number of the name [of God], <i>tet-dalet heh-dalet</i> (the numerical count of these four letters being twenty-two). As <i>tet-dalet</i> hints to the thirteen words of mercy. For the numerical count of <i>tet-dalet</i> is thirteen. And also since the understanding of <i>ted</i> (the word formed by the letters, <i>tet-dalet</i>) is an expression of modesty, as was written by the Tosafot Yom Tov in Tractate Middot 1:3, see there. And the number of <i>heh-dalet</i> is nine, which hints to the nine attributes of the Small Face (<i>Zeir Anpin</i>). And <i>hed</i> (the word formed by the letters, <i>heh-dalet</i>) is an expression of revelation and and uplifting, from the usage, <i>heidad</i> (an uplifting shout). But they need to be connected though occupation with the Torah of twenty-two letters. And when they are connected, they form the name <i>tet-dalet heh-dalet</i> mentioned above, which is the name [of God] that precedes the essential name [of God] in the letters of the alphabet (the letter <i>tet</i> precedes the letter <i>yod</i>, the letter <i>dalet</i> precedes the letter <i>heh</i> and so forth). And that is why the Yalkut placed this statement adjacent to the verse, "You stand before the Lord." Meaning to say, "If you want to stand before the Lord" - meaning before the essential name, and that would be the name, <i>tet-dalet heh-dalet</i> - "occupy yourselves with Torah," which is based on twenty-two letters. And that is why we say the thirteen attributes [of mercy] in the penitential prayers. And one should focus on 'and His throne shall be established upon kindness and He shall sit upon it in truth (<i>emet</i>).' This hints to the exact image, man (<i>adam</i>), for he is the tithe of Him (the numerical count of <i>adam</i> without the <i>alef</i> is a tenth (tithe) of the count of <i>emet</i> without the <i>alef</i>), as it is written in the Tikkunim. And also because <i>emet</i> contains the twenty-two letters: <i>Alef</i> is at the head and <i>tav</i> is at the end of the letters, and <i>mem</i> is in the middle. But the essence of the matter is to repent and to draw down the thirteen words of mercy into oneself. That is as the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, "'And you shall walk in His ways' (Deuteronomy 28:9) - just like He is merciful, you too should be merciful, etc." And this is hinted to in that which was written by the Magen Avraham in the name of the Levush, "One must wrap oneself at the time that we say the thirteen attributes, etc." That is that he must truly wrap himself and make himself similar to God, may He be blessed, to be merciful and gracious and that which is similar to them. And he must distribute charity to the poor, so that he arouses charity and kindness Above to all of Israel. And the repentance must be joyful and trusting of the kindness of the Creator, may He be blessed. 'For the Lord will not forsake His people. Hence it is possible to give a reason for that which one does not need to lower the head (in supplications) on the eve of Rosh Hashanah - it is to show that there is no need to lower the head, but rather to stand with love and joy before the Omnipresent. And behold, that which is written in the Shulchan Arukh (Orach Chaim 582:9), to pray out loud on the Days of Awe, the intention is not like people are accustomed to doing, to yell out during the prayer of the 'eighteen benedictions' (<i>shmoneh esreh</i>). About this it has been said, 'She raised her voice against Me.' Rather the essence is that the heart should cry to God out loud and that one should raise his heart to God. And [the Shulchan Arukh] said [further], "and we are not concerned about causing himself to err" - meaning that he will certainly not cause himself to err in the thing - "since they have a <i>machzor</i> (prayer book) in their hand." That is to say that everyone brings themselves back (<i>machzirim</i>) to God and prays. The essence is that He comes back to being the King over all of the world and that His mercy appear in the world, so that His name be known throughout the world. And through that, He will impact with the holy bounty of children, life, sustenance and all that is good upon us and upon all who seek refuge in Him. Amen.

Rabbi Eliezer said a 'good eye': According to the simple understanding, this means that his eyes will look with gladness on what his friend possesses and will not be mean.  This (meanness) comes from a certain level of denial (of G-d) because if a man considers that everything comes from G-d, he will not be jealous of anything that belongs to his friend.  If G-d gave his friend something, it is definitely proper that he should have it.  If on the other hand he doesn't think that, and that really he should have what his friend possesses he denies the lot that G-d has given him.  this is the meaning of a 'good eye'.

And one whose heart is presumptuous in giving a judicial decision, is foolish, wicked and arrogant (Avot 4:7). And one could understand this as it the verse 'You shall appoint judges and officers for your tribes.' And there are seven gates to the soul. And a person needs to judge themselves, such as the eyes should be turned to see only what is appropriate to be seen; and the ears should only listen to words of Torah and mitzvot, and the mouth should only speak words of Torah and prayer. And an individual is [also] called 'city', as it is written in Kohelet "a small city with a few men in it" (Ecclesiastes 9:14-15), and so one needs to judge and direct oneself towards the good path that they should take, particularly in the times of the counting of the Omer, and even more in the sixth week, when one has to fix the aspect of Yesod, which is symbolized by the verse "Yours, Ad-nai, are greatness, might, splendor, triumph, and majesty—yes, all that is in heaven and on earth; to You, Ad-nai, belong kingship and preeminence above all." (I Chronicles 29:11). And its targum [explanation, Zohar Bereshit 35:339] is "only One in heaven and earth", since Yesod hints that the Holy One of Blessing is the Yesod [basis] and the essence of all the worlds, and this is "only One in heaven and earth", and this is "And one whose heart is presumptuous in giving a judicial decision" is that they are presumptuous in thinking that they do not need to judge themselves, and that they think that do not impair themselves when they see inappropriate things, it is just seeing. And the truth is also found in the simple meaning: when one becomes arrogant and presumptuous, immediately a spirit of foolishness enters in one's heart.
