Genesis

Bereshit



Section 1




Rashi quotes "Rabbi Yitzhak said: The Torah should have started at "From this very month..."...the first mitzvah...[because of] 'the strength of His deeds...". One must understand the solution given regarding all of the Torah portions from Bereshit until "...this very month". The interpretation of the matter is that the essence of the Torah is the mitzvot--this is the written Torah--but the Holy Blessed One wanted to clarify that this world and the entire Creation [exists] because of the 'power of Torah', as it says "B-reishit": He looked within the Torah and created the world [according to it]." And this matter [is in contrast] with Oral Torah, which is dependent on human activity. Thus, all the Torah portions concerned with the stories of forefathers [are there] to show how Torah was created by their deeds. This is what is meant by "the strength of His deeds"--the power that the Holy Blessed One suffused within Creation. This is why it is called "the work/deed of Creation" to declare that the world was created with ten utterances, and the life-force of the world by means of the Torah. The task of humanity, then, is to understand that every deed is a result of the Holy Blessed One's life-force. When a person performs any action, it is [only] because of the power of Torah to fulfill the will of the Creator, thus renewing the light hidden within Creation. This is hinted at in the verse "I have put my words in your mouth...who laid the foundations of the earth and say to Zion 'You are my people'." The sages interpret the verse: Don't read ami/my people--rather immi/with me, as a partner in the work of Creation. The Zohar interprets 'Zion' as the inner point within all things as a imprint and sign to remember that the Holy One is [the source] of all things. This is the life-force which animates all things. The person who clings to this inner point and all of His life-force which flows from this point becomes a partner in the work of Creation. As a result of this ..."in order that He might give them the inheritance of the nations”--an inheritance without restraints. When a person joins the natural world to its active potential, nature cannot obscure the power of holiness.

Section 1





The Rambam noted a difficulty in our parsha - that God says "Go forth..." without first mentioning why Avraham in particular was so precious as to receive such a command. It appears to me that the holy Zohar sees this very fact as what makes Avraham praiseworthy. He heard the call of 'go forth' which comes out from God to all people at all time, as it says 'oy to those who sleep in their holes (and do not hear)!' Our father Avraham heard the call and received its message. Perforce the Divine word was calling to him alone, because there was no one but he listening. Certainly this itself is his greatest praise - that he was ready to receive the call.

Bezrat Hashem
Go, to yourself, from your land. This is because a person is called "goer", and one needs to always be going from one level to another level, and even when one merits getting to a certain level in one's dedication to the Blessed Creator, even this becomes to the person a second nature. And therefore we always need to renew the ways of one's soul in the service of the Holy Name. And Avraham our father a"h was tested with ten tests, and in every test he was made into a new being/creation until he merited to be above nature, as it is written "Wisdom is more of a stronghold to a wise person than ten forces that a city may contain" (Eccl. 7:19) - there is always a force from the from the strength of nature, that tries to bring all back to nature alone - all those wise people that raised above all of it, as it is written "on three the evil impulse had no control, the three Avot" (Bava Batra 17a)

Vayera



Chayei Sara



Section 1





In Rashi - The years of the life of Sarah: All of them were equally good: It can be said that it is the way of a simple person that by way of growing older and increasing his knowledge, his ways become settled. So it comes out that the more he ages, the more he discards bad traits and actions that he would do [in the past]. And if so, only his last moment is called the days of his life, such that he has attained a proper completeness, if he merits it. But with the righteous Sarah, all of her days were proper and without corruption. Even if she certainly elevated herself in her old age, it was not by way of pushing off the earlier actions from the days of her youth. Rather she elevated herself, according to how she was created. For all of a person's days are measured to fix something particular every day, and to raise oneself from one level to another. But she had no flaw or corruption to reform and act more properly. And that is [the meaning of] that which he wrote, "All of them were equally good." And understand [this].

On the verse "And Yaacov wrestled.. until dawn", our Rabbis commentated that they made a cloud of dust that reached the throne of glory. Yaacov's portrait is engraved under the throne of glory, as it is written, "Give truth to Yaacov" and God's seal is truth. This is the portrayal of Yaacov, from which all of Am Yisrael come from as it is written, "all come from the seed of truth". This world is the world of lies, and truth can cannot fully appear, as the midrash tells us "truth said – don’t create a world of lies". There is opposition to the facet of Yaacov under the throne, Eisav and his power. As the midrash connects the name Eisav "עשיו" to the word "שוא" – worthless and unreal. Bnei yisrael, via the Torah which is truth, as our Rabbis teach "there is no truth but Torah" , and so "give truth (to Yaacov)" is in the present tense, as everyday Bnei Yisrael have a revelation what the truth is via the Torah. Bnei Yisrael's task is to reveal truth in the world of lies

Vayeshev



Section 1

...תרל"א
...Baruch HaShem
The word Vayeshev is the the idea of Shabbos. For until now Yaakov was involved with the difficult task of combating the 'klipa' the spiritual husk covering the holiness, of Eisav , Lavan and Shechem. Now Yaakov settled down and connected to his source, which is the idea of Shabbos, which is the idea of completely nullifying oneself to the source. This is what is meant by the Medrash that Yaakov gathering in of himself and his children saved him. Just as it says by Shabbos that it becomes one with the secret of Oneness. And through this connection with the oneness all the negativity falls away. And similarly when Yaakov ran away from Eisav. The Medrash says לֹא שָׁלַוְתִּי וְלֹא שָׁקַטְתִּי, לֹא שָׁלַוְתִּי מֵעֵשָׂו, וְלֹא שָׁקַטְתִּי מִלָּבָן, וְלֹא נָחְתִּי מִדִּינָה, וַיָּבֹא רֹגֶז, בָּא עָלַי רָגְזוֹ שֶׁל יוֹסֵף. Yaakov did not have any rest From Eisav, Lavan Dina and Yosef. When tzadikim want to also have calmness in this world Because the will of the tzadik is to add more glory to HaShem in this world where his glory is covered and hidden. (Through revealing HaShem in everything). This is the idea of Yosef, which is connected to the concept of adding onto Shabbos before and after Shabbos. For through all the work of the 6 days, one yearns to receive the Shabbos with love. And through this one is able to even add Shabbos to the days of the week. [This idea is like the idea that water reflects whatever it sees, so too one's heart is reflected in another person. Just as a bridegroom goes to his bride, she comes out to greet him]. And this is indeed a great task to bring the holiness of Shabbos literally into the days of the week. (Certain laws of Shabbos apply during that time) This therefore is the meaning of the Medrash: The tzadikim wish to be at ease in this world. For they are bringing the idea of The world to come, a world which is always Shabbos, into this world. However they also want to be at ease in this world, and having this come easy in this world is not possible and therefore there is much hiddenness. (Bringing the concept of the world to come into this world, cannot be the same way as it is in the world to come. It is restricted, and covered by the husk of these worldly matters. This is what is meant by the adversity of Yosef. As Rashi explains Yosef was the Flame whereas Yaakov was the fire. And a fire without a flame cannot reach far. Yosef’s mission was to bring the flame of the fire to far places (even into this world, and therefore he was able to be Eisav’s adversary). This is what is mentioned in the Medrash that He saw a group of dogs and he sat between them. Yaakov also wanted to purify and extract the holiness even from the ‘dogs’, from the lowliness of this world. Similarly after the end of last week's parsha which goes through all the kings of Eisav, Yaakov goes and sits between them and through his flame is able to burn down all their ‘husks’

Miketz



For Chanuka



Section 1



(First Night) My master, my elder, my teacher, may the memory of the tzadik be for the world to come, said the reason why we bless "that made miracles" when we see the light of Chanukah. This is because the clarification of the miracles happens through the lights. And in truth it is written "these lights are holy". And it seems that after that there was the lightning of the menorah in those days through a miracle, even if there was no oil for the children of Israel to kindle. And now, even though at this moment when we do not have the menorah and the pure oil, it is still relevant to kindle because of the miracle, since this miracle remains for the generations. Yet the vessel for this kindling is the mitzvah of kindling the candle of Hanukkah as it is written "the candle is a mitzvah and Torah is light" (Prov. 6:23), meaning, the candle is the vessel to receive oil and wick and light. So too, the [positive] mitzvot corresponding to the 248 members of the body, plus awe plus love sum up 250, as candle (ner) does, as it is written in the Tikkunim. And it is important that the mitzvot are in action, and the light of the Torah hangs on them, and the mitzvot are written in the Torah and through them the deeds are also fixed. And this is also the fixing of the members of the body of a person. And the Torah brings awareness and wisdom to a person. And also the language "light of Chanukah", that was fixed by our sages z"l, in the blessing of the mitzvah, also, is explained as above, since they did not write "to kindle a light on Chanukah." There is the light of Chanukah. And through the fulfillment of the mitzvah we kindle this known light. And truly, the Tabernacle was hidden, and the menorah was hidden, and after that in those days there was the kindling - and then, through a miracle, even today the light shines. And regarding this my teacher, my master, my father, my elder, may the memory of the tzadik be for the world to come, said that since the western light shines due to a miracle, it also shines in the darkness, where it is hidden, as explained. And our sages fixed this, that we are to arouse and kindle that light through the mitzvah of the light of Chanukah, since through this mitzvah the revelation of the miracle comes about. [And see that the language used in the Tur is "to remind" and not "to remember", see there on paragraph 679 (Tur, Orach Chaim 682:1)]. And all those issues, the Tabernacle and the Menorah, they are found as a hint inside every person in Israel, in that there is in every person in Israel a piece in the Torah [and the revelation of the Menorah, that is hidden, also happens to a person, and in the days of the festival it can also be revealed, through the aspect of character traits].
In the book Kedushat Levi the explanation for " at this time" is that it is really now, that there is in every year a revelation of the miracles that were then, see there. However, in any instance, to feel the revelation of a  miracle one needs to be separated from nature. And according to the level that one is not stuck in nature and physicality, is the ability to feel, since a miracle is above nature. And yet, in any instance, through the mitzvah of kindling the light of Chanukah a person clings onto what is above nature, since the essence of the mitzvah is to cling and connect with what is above nature. Even when a person is doing things, dealing with daily actions and preoccupations, one can still be connected through the light of the mitzvah since they are in the aspect of doing in the physical, as explained. And my master, my elder, my teacher, may the memory of the tzadik be for the world to come, said that we determine holy days through Hallel and Thanks, since they fixed that a person reveals the days through Hallel and Thanks so that the days will open and illuminate for the person. And so he explained "a memory God made for God's wonders" (Ps. 111:4) - that a person should be reminded of the revelation of miracles and wonders in every years on those days, these are his words, may his memory be for a blessing....
(Second night) It is written "the candle of Ad-nai is the soul of a person, searching all one's inner parts" (Prov. 20:27). And in the Gemarah: "a search from candles. One candle from one candle" "I will search Yerushalayim with candles" (Pesachim 7b and Zeph. 1:12) see there. The issue is that the Tabernacle and the Temple are found inside every person in Israel, just as the verse "and I will dwell in them" (Ex. 25:8). And according to what a person clarifies for themselves, that all aliveness of the soul, about which we say every day "the soul You gave me is pure" - that is, that there is one pure point inside every person of Israel, just that this point is truly hidden and concealed. And in the time that the Temple was standing, it was revealed that all aliveness comes from the Holy One of Blessing. And this is the issue of the inspiration of the Shechinah, which is a proof that the Holy One of Blessing soaks Israel completely. And now, that the Tabernacle is hidden, in any instance a person can find this through searching with the candles, as explained. And the explanation is that the candles are the mitzvot, as explained above, and when we search with all our heart and soul [exert ourselves] to do a mitzvah with all aliveness, since the candle [ner] is soul, spirit and also the 248 parts of the body with which we do a mitzvah with awe and love, since the gematria of candle [ner] is as above, then this preparation and strength enables a person to find through the aspect of Tabernacle, and to arrive to that hidden point we spoke about before. And all the more so in those days, in which miracles were made that lights were kindled through a miracle, even though the aspect of candles was then missing from the Children of Israel. And also now, there is an immediate help through the mitzvah of the Hanukkah light to find, through the aspect of hidden [light], since the essence of hiddenness is darkness, in which we need candles to search and find, as explained. And the book Kedushat Levi explaines that Hanukkah is in the aspect of Koh, since Moshe received his prophetic powers through this word, and it is the most clarified inspiration. And the prophets in "Koh", even though it is concealed, it is a lens that is not seen. And in Hannukah there is a revelation also of the aspect Koh, which is set also in the dark and hidden place, as explained. And in any instance, since it is written "I will search ... with candles" it is explained that one can find, even today, the aspect of the Temple and Yerushalayim through searching. And so it is written "from 'no one seeks her' can be inferred that it requires seeking" (Sukkah 41a quoting Jeremiah 30:17). And this happens through the strength that a person has when they do mitzvot with all their aliveness, they will awaken the inner aliveness that is the pure point, and about which is said "searching all inner parts", that one is able to find with the force of innerness the Hidden Light that is in all inner parts, as explained. [And this is the issue of "one should consider oneself as having a holy object in one's innards" (Taanit 11b). And when a person fixes themselves like this, the verse about them is "and they will make Me a sanctuary and I will dwell in them" (Exodus 25:8). In them, really, as explained.]



Zot [THIS IS] Chanukah. It’s not clear what is meant by “Zot (THIS].”  I heard from my teacher (acronym not known by translator) that the meaning in the Midrash is that following the word Zot, comes Aaron [the High Priest] like in the words “with THIS I have faith.”  The Kingdom of Heaven is called Zot which is everything.  The point that gives everything life is called Zot which is the life-force in all things. On Chanukah we clarify this point that all comes from the blessed Hashem.  It’s written that “Aaron did (כן) thus” and Rashi explains this means that Aaron did not sleep.  The meaning of כן is like Zot.  

Section 2



Section 3




(Second night) In the sefer Kedushat Levi it is explained that "at this time" means that the miracle renews itself in every year, see there. And this means that the miracle that is fixed in time fixes a clarification of holiness through the time, for the generations, even though every miracle happens beyond [the concept of] time, since in any instance the root of time and nature is connected to Above. And a person needs to believe that there is no change, and this is what we say "in those days in at this time", since every one unit of time is just a moment hidden in nature, and then it goes up to its root, as explained. And in truth, a miracle that is left connected in time and nature is a greater marvel, and maybe it was because of that that one cruse of oil was left over, even if it would be possible to have light through a miracle without oil, but this would mean that there was no pertinence of this miracle in nature, and for it remain forever [this is necessary]. And through the lights we can find the Hidden Light in these days, and this is the point of the mitzvot, to illuminate, to find through them the Hidden Light in this world. And the mitzvot of the lights of Chanukah, that are specific for these days, since the search is with the candles, as explained. And so my teacher, my elder, PBUH, said, regarding "a memory God made for God's wonders" (Ps. 111:4) that due to the mitzvot a memory was made, to arouse the wonders that happened on those days, as explained. ...
"Made in truth and equity" (Ps. 111:8). It seems that we can understand that this verse applies to a person who does a mitzvah that can only be done in truth. Meaning, a person who is truth and equitable in those character traits are made [by them] and this is why the expression "made" is better.

Hanukkah and Purim are illuminations deriving from the three Biblical holidays. Only the three holidays explicitly mentioned in the Torah are considered “Written Torah.” Corresponding to them are the holidays are of the “Oral Torah.” These are lights that are received similarly to how the light of the moon derives from the light of the sun, as everyone knows. Thus, by virtue of the Jewish people accepting the holidays properly, each holiday leaves an impression on the congregation of Israel. And by virtue of this, [the Jewish people] established other, corresponding holidays. Hanukkah derives from the holiday of Sukkot, and Purim derives from the holiday of Shavuot. We hope that there will yet be another deriving from the holiday of Passover, as it says, “I will show him wondrous deeds As in the days when You sallied forth from the land of Egypt” (Micah 7:15).

Section 14



Section 15



Section 16







The name Chanukah comes from the expression of renewal, and so there was the inauguration of the altar. And the point is there through the affixing of Halel and Thanksgiving [to those days]. And the midrashim state: "not everyone who wants is able to say a song, only someone for whom a miracle was done can, and if one says a song it is known that all one's sins were forgiven, and one is made into a new creation, see the Song of Deborah in Judges. And so too in these days, that they merited to sing Halel and to give thanks for the miracle in which there is renewal, and that renewal remains forever. And the reason is that through the song there is renewal because a miracle is a door to the Root Above Nature, and in there, there is always renewal, since "there is nothing new under the sun" - but above the sun there is. And one who says a song about a miracle makes known that one belongs to and clings to the miracle, and there is renewal in that person. And so too I heard from my elder, my teacher, z"l, "until the foot (regel) stops in the marketplace": through the Chanukah candles the repetition [regilut] is cancelled, and we can come out of the and nature and come into renewal: and more, through the name Chanukah comes intruction [chinukh], which is preparedness for future redemption.

For Hanukkah and Parashat Miketz
(a) In the name of my grandfather and teacher, of blessed memory:  He explained the disagreement between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel as to whether one increases day by day or decreases.  He explained that, in the lamp, there is an aspect of illumination and one of combustion, that being to burn the waste material and to purge the inside by the fire of desire for Him, may He be blessed.  And Beit Shammai are of the view that, initially, it is necessary to "depart from evil [and (then) do good]" (Ps. 34:14), and thus the practice of decreasing day by day.  And Beit Hillel are of the view that the main idea is to increase day by day, such that the enthusiasm that illuminates through him will purify his body and will automatically purge the waste material.  (b) And this is also what is written that Yosef placed Menashe first, while Ya'akov placed Efraim first.  For the name Menashe is from "God has made me forget [nashani] ... my travail" (Gen. 41:51), as with "forget your people and your father's house" (Ps. 45:11), and he thought this about Ya'akov.  But Ya'akov our ancestor, peace be on him, realized that not everyone is prepared for this, and he placed Efraim first [see Gen. 41:52:  Efraim "for God has made me fertile (hifrani)"], corresponding to the view of Beit Hillel.  Thus far [my grandfather's] statement, may his memory be for a blessing.  (c) And according to this, both the formulation "increases day by day" and the formulation "decreases day by day" make sense, for they are in truth two paths.  There are those who proceed by diminishing the subjugation of the body, and there are those who proceed by increasing the light of the spirit and of the insides.  And this is a matter of "Ehad marbeh v'ehad mam'it" [originally, it is all the same whether one does much or one does little, provided that one directs one's mind towards Heaven.  Ber. 5b, 17a].  And these two aspects are of Hallel and Thanksgiving, as we have said elsewhere.

R’ Elazar of Worms says in his work ‘the Rokeach’ that the thirty-six candles we light on Hannukah parallel the thirty-six hours for which the original light of the six days of creation shone, before it was hidden away. If this is so, then it appears that each Hannukah candle draws from the or haganuz, the hidden light of creation, and gives light in great darkness, as our Sages hinted with their description of the or haganuz as a light which shined from one end of the world to the other (Chagigah 12a). There is no hiddenness or obscurity (he’elem) before this light. We call the world (olam) which obscures (ma’alim) and hides this light ‘the natural,’ but the original light of creation shone through all these layers of concealment and it was hidden away for the righteous; on this it is written “A light shines for the upright in the darkness…” (Psalms 112:4) It is also written “The people that walked in darkness have seen a brilliant light…” (Isaiah 9:1) The generation which lived in the days of the wicked Greeks walked in darkness, as the Sages taught “darkness refers to Greece which darkened the eyes of Israel…” (Bereshit Raba 2:4), nevertheless they served God with a spirit of self-sacrifice even in the midst of this darkness. That is why they merited that the hidden light shine for them, and some of its illumination remains, radiating from year to year even in these lowly times. Every servant of God must rejoice during these days when a touch of the hidden light illuminates Divine service. The primary intent of the wicked ones was to make us forget God’s laws and Torah, and the Hannukah lights bring us to remembrance.

In the verse, 'Thus shall you say' etc., for the 'women [...] with gentle language' etc., 'and tell [...] harsh matters'. And there's a difficulty, that with one expression being said, according to Rashi, 'in this language and in this order'. And perhaps one could say that really these words are for women and those who are lacking understanding. They are only words of encouragement how the Holy One, blessed be He, brought us close and uplifted us. But people that understand, know that this is not a small thing and that they are receiving with this, a great and awesome yoke to serve the Creator of the world and to clarify his kingdom, may it be blessed, in the world. And therefore it says with this expression and in this order that it was revealed before Him, may He be blessed, that with this expression each person will continue according to their path. The women with encouragement. And the men with an awesome undertaking. And in the Gemora we also find a disagreement whether commandments were given to us to derive benefit from. And the law is that they weren't given to us to derive benefit from, as mentioned above.

"And Mordechai returned to the gate of the king" etc. Our sages say, may their memory be blessed, that he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. The explanation for 'and he returned' is that he returned in repentance. This is the way of the tzadik {righteous}, through which he is assisted by HaShem, may He be blessed. He subjugates himself further through the shame from before Him, may He be blessed. And Mordechai regretted that he caused the whole decree. And now HaShem, may He be blessed, did a kindness like this for him. He became further ashamed. And he returned/repented. Because certainly, repentance through the shame is not like that like before {one has shame}. That there are two (ways of gaining) humility. Firstly, through worthlessness {that a person understands that he is worthless}. And the second, through greatness as it is written elsewhere {that a person realises his greatness - who he is and what he has - and  realises that he doesn't deserve  any of it}. And this is the difference between a tzadik {righteous person} and a rasha {a wicked person} as it is written "and Haman went out etc." ... "happy and with a good heart" because of the feast. And this was his downfall. But by Mordechai it says 'and he returned/repented' as written above. Furthermore it is apparent that Mordechai knew that HaShem, may He be blessed, will certainly help the Jewish people as it is written "relief and deliverance" etc. And so it's written "and he knew all that had happened" etc. However through this way, that all tzadikim {righteous}, that even though they know of the salvation, nevertheless they are able to cry out with a truly complete heart as if they didn't know. And someone that isn't {on that level}, the true salvation isn't shown to him. And this is dependent on complete faith that one nullifies his intellect to HaShem, may He be blessed, and he knows and believes that there is no contradiction in any of this, that the salvation arrives through the outcry of man. Even though HaShem, may He be blessed, will not forsake the Jewish people, without question. Nevertheless it is necessary to cry out in a time of distress as it is written "a time of distress" etc. and from that, one will be saved.

And in the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 8:3), "'This is the offering of Aharon' (Leviticus 6:13) - the offering of Aharon was considered as beloved as the offering of the chieftains, as it is written (Numbers 7:17), 'This was the offering of Nachshon, etc.'" And the idea is that the princes' dedication [of the tabernacle] was so that the enlightenment of the rebirth that occurred with the erection of the tabernacle would remain. For it is written (Numbers 7:2), "And the chieftains of Israel offered (<i>hikrivu</i>, which more literally means, brought close)" - that they felt a coming close in their souls to the Holy One, blessed be He. And the dedication was so that an impression of this would remain for future generations. However Aharon the priest was always cleaving to this rebirth. And this is what Scripture was consoling him with, "Yours lasts forever" - see there in the Midrash of Behaalotekha - to say, that he does not need the dedication, since he feels rebirth every day. This is as it is written (about Aharon), "This is the offering" - and that is as if it is pointing with the finger that this thing does not get old for him. And in fact we see that the tribe of Levi did not volunteer during the dedication of the tabernacle. And at first glance, this is a wonder! For the bringing of their offerings began from themselves, with the advice of Netanel ben Tzuar. If so, why did the tribe of Levi not also participate in this? Hence it appears that the tribe of Levi, which was not involved in the sin of the [golden] calf did not feel excitement about the erection of the tabernacle, like the other tribes did. For their level was above the construction of the tabernacle, just like the Children of Israel were [all] prepared to be before that sin. But behold they themselves are the servants of the tabernacles, so that they are called the vessels of the tabernacle and the temple. But the other tribes did bring offerings, so that the enlightenment of the erection of the tabernacle would remain with them forever. So does it appear to me.

B'H - from the first days of Pesach, not written in the order of the seder from the first night
In every generation one is obligated see themselves as if they had personally left Egypt, etc, and after, the Haggadah says "and took us out".  And it appears that it is through this that the faith that there is an Egypt in every generation is revealed. And the Maharal wrote that there is a general assumption that every one that was in the coming out of Egypt is  obligated only to see as if they had come personally out of Egypt, see there. And one could say also as above, that it is through belief that one enters into the general assumption, and obviously, in the general assumption that there was a coming out of Egypt for the life-force point [that exists in every Jewish soul], that from there flows life to every Jewish person, and through faith we come to that. And after that [it is possible to] see oneself as if they came out of Egypt. And one knows and believes that the understanding that one has can only exist because of coming out of Egypt. And this is the explanation in the telling of the story of coming out of Egypt, even if we are all wise etc, since even if one is very wise and connected to God, one's life exists so he will know that all this is due to the coming out of Egypt, because in truth it is so, and one needs to clarify this through faith. And 'telling' really is 'clarifying' and 'revealing' since in every generation there is a coming out of Egypt, according to what is happening in that generation, and all this happened in the time of the Exodus. And according to a person's faith as if one came out, it is revealed in one's life, and one can feel the coming out of Egypt of this moment, and one is able to come out from their own constricted place [their Egypt].

CORRESPONDING TO FOUR CHILDREN, ETC.  This seems to correspond to the four expressions of redemption, for the redemption was from all four of the exiles [Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, and Rome].  And these questions apply to every Jew.  [Hacham]  With regard to intellectual analysis, since through this means, the evil inclination doubts the hukkim.  And to this, the answer must be prepared in the person's mind -- that carrying out the will of God, may He be blessed, brings greater pleasure (ta'am) and joy than understanding the rationale (ta'am) of the mitzva.  And this is [the meaning of] "There is no after-party following the Pesah" (Ein maftirin ahar haPesah afikoman) -- that the pleasure (ta'am) from the mitzva of matza, even though it has no taste (ta'am), is sweeter to him than dainties (mat'amim).  [Rasha]  The Rasha actually casts off the yoke:  "Why the service (avodah)?"  And his saying "to you" (lachem) means "how can [mere] flesh and blood be of service to God, may He be blessed?"  And in this way, he doubts the supernal caring [hashgaha], as is said in the literature.  And the answer, "For the sake of this" (ba'avur zeh), means that [precisely] by virtue of his being flesh and blood and not having the ideal (kara'ui) intellect, our service is important before Him, may He be blessed, more than [that of] the supernal angels.   [Tam]  The question of the Tam through his simplicity, when the Holy One, blessed be He, provides some enlightenment through His grace, the person is susceptible to becoming conceited, in saying "What's this," and he must recognize that this is only through supernal grace, and this is [the meaning of] "With a mighty hand, etc." -- in the absence of any merit of the person.  [She'eino yodea lish'ol]  And the one who does not know how to ask is in the bitterest exile, for he has no idea at all how to open his mind.  And regarding this, it says "you open it for him" (At p'tah lo).  And for this we give praise, for the redemption from Egypt was in all four types of "exile," collectively and individually, for these aspects are found in each individual Jew.  And they are called "banim" (sons, children) because in fact the "binyan" (structure) is completed through these inquiries into the human mind when he merits to enter the true path and to leave the vanities of this world and their matters. 

Section 5









Pesach is the New Year for the Festivals. This is because at the very beginning one needs to distance themselves from the Evil Inclination, as is referred to in the Holy Zohar: Matzah is from the language of trial and argument.  On this holiday everyone can leap from their connection to the "Other Side" even if they are not on the level to do so.  After this, they merit Torah.  After that, they merit to bring in the light of the Torah to their inner humanity. "Draw me" (Shir Hashirim 1:4) is on Pesach - which is drawing it in.  The children of Israel are drawn in from the Idol Worship in Egyp, even though they weren't prepared with all their heart.  Thus it happened with a "Strong Arm" in the way that a person is drawn from the womb of their mother in the Midrash.  After this "Let us run" (ibid) on the seventh day of Pesach that they ran into the sea - a willingness to sacrifice their lives.  "The King has brought me into his chambers" (ibid) The chambers of Torah on Shavuot. "Let us delight and rejoice" (ibid) Which is the holiday of Sukkot.

For He has triumphed gloriously.  One should say, "Even though He has triumphed gloriously."  As Rashi said, "however much I may praise Him there will still remain something additional in Him to be praised," as it is written (Exod. 15:11), "awesome of praises [t'hilot]."   And this was their uncertainty, whether to sing, as Rashi said, "it entered his mind to sing, and he actually did so."  This is similar to what I heard from my grandfather, z"l, regarding King Hizkiyah, who, because he failed to respond with song to the downfall of San'heriv, he was not made the Messiah -- he said that His Kingdom, may He be blessed, was apparent, such that they did not have to take any action regarding the miracle.  And thus it says in Shir HaShirim Rabbah (4:8:3), "This has already been made known" (Isa. 12:5); see there on verse 4:8.  However, in truth, one must rouse oneself and sing the song, so that the joy and the love overcome the fear, and this is what is added (Exod. 14:31):  "The people feared, etc.," and nevertheless, "they believed" and they responded to the miracle and sang a song before Him.  And the Israelites had to establish this clearly, that, while "He has triumphed gloriously," He is nevertheless close to His People, and [they had] to refute the evil ones who say that God does not concern Himself with what happens in the world.

On the verse, "Then sang" (Exodus 15:1), Rashi explained that "it entered his heart that he would sing." But the Sages, may their memory be blessed, expounded from here that the revival of the dead is from the Torah. And it can be said that it is all one: That that which Rashi said that it entered his heart that he would sing, is that they were not able to actualize everything they wanted. For the world was not fit to receive more than these words [which they actually sang]. And that is [the meaning of] that which is written, "and they said, saying." That they said these words, implying that they had still more in their hearts. And it is from this itself that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, expounded that the revival of the dead is from the Torah - so that they will then finish the song, like it was in their hearts. And the general principle is that everything to which a person takes effort in this world in service to the Creator, may He be blessed, is not for naught. There will still be a time that he will complete what he wanted [to do], either in this world or in the future. And that is the hint to the revival of the dead, as mentioned above.

This verse make these afflictions depend upon the skin. This is based on the verse that says: "...the Lord God fashioned garments of skin for the man and his wife and God dressed them." (Genesis 3:21) The Midrash refers to a distinction between the "garments of skin" and "garments of light." It was because of sin that they came to be garbed in this coarse clothing, the skin of the snake. All of corporeality derives from there. Previously, they were in a spiritual state, as is said of the future. At the giving of the Torah, too, Israel were ready for this state. That is why it says of Moses that the skin of his face shone. (Exodus 34:29) He so redeemed "skin" that he was lit up through the shining speculum. But we did not remain at that rung. Therefore, the afflictions reappeared; the Midrash teaches that it was sin that made us again impaired. It is also known, however, that the skin is porous, containing many tiny holes. These allow the light to shine through its "shells." Only sin clogs up those pores, so that "darkness covers the earth." (Isaiah 60:2) That is why "the leprous affliction" is translated [into Aramaic] as <i>segiru</i> or "closing." Now we also understand why the purification rites are assigned to Aaron and his sons the priests; it was they who set right the sin of the Golden Calf.

In the verse, 'Like the practice of the land of Egypt' etc., 'my judgements' etc., 'to follow/walk in them'. Rashi explains 'you are not permitted to be exempt' from them. As it's written 'like' the practice, not actually 'the practice' of the land of Egypt. Because the Bnei Yisroel were already a holy congregation and what is the relevance to warn them from acting like these sinners? But the explanation (comes to teach us) that there should not be any act of a Jew that is like/similar to the acts of the wicked that all their acts are for worldliness alone. Rather the Bnei Yisroel need to sanctify all their actions to cleave to the source of the life-force and to take from it life-force. Because the action needs to be only for the purpose that man 'walks' in the service of HaShem (may He be blessed) and simple Jews are directed to eat and drink to add strength in their service of the Creator which is also a general (form of) 'walking'. And what also of the righteous that all their actions are for the sake of Heaven, and so too with every commandment that a person does, it needs to be directed (one should perform it with the intent) that through this (the performance of the commandment) he will come to greater holiness that he could add at all times from one (spiritual) level to the next (spiritual) level. Like (the concept that fulfilment of a) 'commandment brings another commandment'. And it won't be that the commandment was done simply to be discharged from the obligation, rather on the contrary, that through the merit of this, one will receive (the opportunity for) other commandments, as it's written, that the reward for (fulfilling a) commandment is (the opportunity to fulfil another) commandment. And this is what it means 'to follow/walk in them' etc., and to take from them life-force as it's written 'and live (by) them' (or possibly, and life is within them).

Sefat Emet – Rabbi Yehudah Leib Alter of Ger, translated by Rabbi Arthur Green
“Take unto yourselves the fruit of the goodly tree.” (Lev. 23:40)
Scripture also says: “Tell me the ways to live, to be sated with joy in Your presence.” (Psalms 16:11). Lulav is numerically equal to hayyim (life), Israel desire the true life of their inner selves. This is what it means to be “sated with joy” – the more deeply you take life into your heart, the more you are sated. This happens through the lulav and the species that accompany it. Israel actually point to God, taking in the light of the Sukkah, which is given to them as a gift. When the King invites guests, he gives them what their heart desires. “Whoever invites someone does so with the intent that they eat and drink.”
That is why God says to us: “Take unto yourselves,” meaning that we should choose life for ourselves…Awareness for the whole year comes about on Sukkot, the last of the three “legs” on which the year stands. The mitzvah of Sukkah stands on its own, but the lulav/species represent the awareness that Israel receive and take into the depths of their hearts…5:181

In the parsha of "bread of faces (lechem hapanim), on Shabbat he shall arrange them etc" - and it is written "Come, eat My food" (Prov. 9:5). This is the receiving of the Flow of heaven, that clings to the Upper Root and this is the internalness (penimiut) of the Flow. As it is written in the Holy Zohar regarding the day of Shabbat, that even though manna did not come down on that day, all blessings are dependent on the seventh day, see there (Zohar 2:184a:7). And this is why the bread is called lechem hapanim, it is the internalness of the Flow, as it is written "not on bread alone does a person live, etc, comes out from God's mouth" (Deut. 8:3) - this is Torah. And a hint of this is what is written there: "Face to face did Hashem speak with you on the mountain, from the midst of the fire" (Deut. 5:4) - and here "bread of faces". And the root of the bread from heaven is that it flows from the holy Shabbat to all the days of the week, with the force of the Torah, according to the readiness of the children of Israel that Torah gave to them. And just as there are 53 parshiot in the Torah and in each Shabbat we read a different parsha, this is also true in heaven, see Zohar on Vayakhel. And this is that the Torah, being all made of Divine Names, still has the parsha that changes every week, and every Shabbat has different combination of phrases. This too is hinted by the bread of faces, that on every Shabbat is was set. And according to the 12 loaves that the children of Israel set in order, so too the Flow of heaven continues. And it is written "as face answers to face in water" (Prov. 27:19) and this is an aspect of the Torah, that is Oral and Written. And in our parshe it is written "on the day of Shabbat". There is Shabbat that comes from Above to Below and there is Shabbat that comes from Below to Above, as explained in the Holy Zohar. And therefore the Text said "according to the arranging of the of the bread on the day of Shabbat in a Awakening from Below, so too in the day of Shabbat from Above to Below it will be this arranging, and as it is written in Chagigah 26b "as its arranging is its taking away." And the Torah is a gift to the children of Israel, and according to their level is the Torah's revealing itself to them, since there are seventy faces to the Torah, and "face to face". And on every Shabbat the Flow is renewed through the force of the Torah. ["The One who renews each day Creation with goodness", Bereshit is Torah, which is called good, and regarding Shabbat it is written "it is good to thank Hashem", a hint that every moment a new interpretation is invited] and so too on Shavuot when the Torah was given there are two loaves of bread. And "on every Shabbat" is a level below "twelve loaves", since the Torah is understood and interpreted and gives life and sustenance to every level until this world. And twelve limits and twelve requests that are in the Prayer they are the Lower Supports of the Upper Root, as it is written in different places.

Briefly, because I forgot.
Death and Life are held in the tongue. A coal burns when you blow on it, and extinguishes when you spit on it. [Midrash Rabbah, 33:1, if there was a loaf that was subject to a tithe, and a man eats it before tithing, death is on his tongue, but if he first tithed it and then ate, life is on his tongue.] Certainly there is sacred vitality in every thing in the world, because the world was created with the light of torah. So the torah is called Fire, and the strength of the fire of torah is in each thing. Yet it is concealed inside and bound together as if in a coal. So we must search and find the light of the Torah that is in each thing. And it is in the language, because the essence of people's life-force is the breath that is within, as it is written, "And he breathed in his nose, the breath of life. And this we need to protect--that every articulation should be to the full strength of humanity's life-force. And from this, the life-force within all things awakens and is revealed. But when we act materialistically, it is as if we are spitting on a coal--not using our breath--only using the physical body of the mouth, and so we conceal the internal aspects, as mentioned above. And likewise, the Tevel compliments the Ma'aser, since we set aside a portion from the outset, to clarify that all the life-force comes as a miracle, and so it is the Ma'aser that gives life-force to the rest. The life-force is brought out from the internally concealed, as mentioned above. And if we do not set aside the Ma'aser, it is as if the husk is still stuck to the seed, and the life-force within cannot awaken, as mentioned above. 
is death in the power of the tongue, but if he first tithed it and then ate 
there is life in the power of the tongue

Regarding the verse (Vayikra 25:55) “The Children of Israel are servants to Me; they are my servants…” My claim came before [any other claim]. This is still true today, for according to the level at which one accepts the yoke of Heaven, enslavement to governments is removed, as our sages have taught (Avot 3:5), “One who accepts the yoke of Torah, has the yoke of government removed.” There are also roles of servant and child… [The roles of servant and child] parallel the aspects of Torah and commandments, for one who engages in Torah [as a child of G-d] is free. (Avot 6:2) However, everyone must accept the yoke of Heaven and of commandments upon themselves [as a servant]. This is the meaning of the verse, “They are My servants”, as it is written “Israel, in whom I am glorified.” (Isaiah 49:3) It is glorious for G-d when Israel accepts servitude to Him, despite being His children. It is not only praise of Israel, but it is also true testimony to the Creator… There are always levels of servant and child, servant and child, in that the greater one’s grasp of the secrets of the King [as G-d’s child], the more one lowers one’s self to accept the yoke of Heaven as a servant. Consequently, one merits to see and grasp, as a child, and then one returns to being a servant… In Nisan, we become free and receive the yoke of Heaven. All the days of the Sefirah, we are like servants, doing His will, until we achieve seven complete weeks, which is the oath we swore and in which we have stood since Mount Sinai. We then merit on Shavuot to receive the Torah, like children who search through the vaults of the king. However, we then return to being servants, which is Sukkot, when we return and repent on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, and accept the yoke of Heaven anew, which is the glory mentioned above, as the Holy One finds glory in them…Similarly, daily, one accepts the yoke of Heaven [as a servant] in the morning and thereby merits Torah [as a child] according to his level. And at night, one returns to accept the yoke of Heaven. And the level of the “second servant” is greater, as can be understood.

Regarding the Reading of the Book of Ruth on Shavuot:
This is really about the Oral Torah. The Kadosh Barukh Hu wants the children of Israel to expand the Written Torah through their deeds--for we know that the deeds of the righteous are “Torah”. Through the deeds of Boaz and Ruth, a scroll was produced by Divine Guidance. 
It is written “And Elohim said...saying”, meaning: the children of Israel said words like these to themselves. It’s also written “who gave us a Torah of truth, and within us, planted eternal life”--this refers to Oral Torah,  the unique quality of Torah which is Israel’s. They have a unique intellectual approach to understand secrets within the Torah which are hidden and not explicit within the Torah itself. 
This itself is the matter of Boaz, whose name means Bo Oz--strength within him--that is to say, he had deep faith in the words of the Sages who explained “an Amonite--excluding an Amonitess”. He had no doubt in the matter, like Ploni did who said “lest I endanger my inheritance”. On the contrary! He was ecstatic to show that the interpretation of the Rabbis was the Torah given on Sinai. 
“Trust in the Sages” is the foundation of Oral Torah, and this is what is meant by “Truth and Trust”. Written Torah is explicitly exoteric. Yet, it is the will of the Divine that in this downcast world, Israel achieve ‘truth’ by way of ‘trust’.
The ego gives itself over to remove that trust from a person. It makes it seem in one’s eyes as though they are alienated from Hashem Yisbarakh, and tells them that it is arrogant to even try to seek Hashem Yisbarakh in silent prayer, and the like. But the truth is the exact opposite! Seeking God at all fosters the fear of Heaven. 
One should contemplate to see that it is in no way disgraceful to contemplate the trivialities of the world for “the entire world is filled with His Presence”. How could someone be ashamed of pondering that what is His true desire?
Now what emerges is the reason that Israel wished to hear the first two commandments from God Himself: to believe the truth of God as the lifeforce of every human being. As it says “I am the Lord your God”--literally, all of your lifeforce. That’s why it is addressed to the second person singular, for the innermost life force of every Jew is is the same point which gives life to all of creation as it is says “You ‘give life’ to all things”. Thus our Sages taught: A person should always see themselves as if the Holy Presence abides in one’s insides.”, for a holy person should be able to uncover the holy presence within themselves. A person doesn’t create something new by some sort of deed, rather she reveals the innermost life force within her as it says “And He breathed into his mouth life breath”. If a person can believe in this life force, to not forget about it,  and always strive to cleave to the root of this life force, they can merit the “truth by means of trust”, mentioned above. 
One should believe that as the Holy One said “Let there be light”, that the light can shine one more day. Just as God said “I am the Lord your God”, there is a divine life force in every Jew.

This holiday is called the Festival of Shavuot (Weeks) based on the oath (<i>shavuah</i> that they swore and remains, from [the experience] at Mount Sinai. And this is by way of a true sacrifice of the self - as they said, the soul of the Israelites departed. It is like they said (Weekday Siddur, Aleinu), "To You every knee will bend, every tongue will swear" - before a man is created, he is made to take an oath. And likewise when he departs from the world, he sees the Divine Presence, as it were, and is negated to Him, may He be blessed - and that is the oath. And so too was the revelation of, "I am the Lord, your God," at Mount Sinai; and that is why their souls departed. And that is why they are also able to properly accept the yoke of His Kingdom, may He be blessed, today on this festival. And we have already written in another place that the Festival of Pesach and of Shavuot [correspond to] the aspect of the hand tefillin and the head tefillin. The acceptance of the Kingdom of Heaven on Pesach to subjugate the body and the animal spirit is the aspect of the hand tefillin - to subjugate [physical] strength; but on Shavuot, it is the head tefillin. It is as they said (Berakhot 6a:19), "'And all the nations of the earth shall see, etc. the name of the Lord is called upon you' (Deuteronomy 28:10) - this is [a reference to] the head tefillin." It is to subjugate the mind and the intellect to Him, may He be blessed. So too is the order: First one must abnegate himself without complete knowledge; afterwards we merit to know that this is the Torah and the purpose of the three holidays. This is according to the order that our Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 15a:1): One should relieve himself, wash his hands, don tefillin, recite Shema, and pray - this is the complete [acceptance of] the Kingdom of Heaven. So too is the matter more generally of the three holidays and Shemini Atzeret, which is [associated with] the aspect of prayer. That is why the two breads are on Shavuot, as it is stated (Psalms 9:5), "[Wisdom says,] Come, eat my bread." The hand tefillin and the head tefillin [correspond to] the aspect of, "man and beast You deliver, O Lord" (Psalms 36:7). For the hand tefillin [corresponds] to the aspect of the Oral Torah, the arousal of man; and afterwards he merits the flow of knowledge from the Heavens, [corresponding to] the aspect of the Written Torah.

Concerning the issue of "zachor" and "shamor:" "Shamor" is the holiness that descends on Shabbat. And we must be vigilant to avoid violating this aspect of Shabbat's holiness. This aspect of Shabbat--the holiness that descends from above--is the aspect of Shabbat regarding which it is written that we must "guard" the mitzva of Shabbat. But "zachor" refers to the holiness that the Jewish people draw into the Shabbat, adding to its holiness by renewing the day and reciting the Shabbat prayers.  And this (i.e., the "zachor" aspect of Shabbat) is a higher level. But our sages taught that anyone who has "shmira" also has "zechira." This is because one who "guards" the Shabbat will ultimately merit the higher level of "remembering" the Shabbat.

5664. ...
From the holiday of Shavu'ot. 
They established [reading of] Ruth on Shavu'ot, to say that, by means of B'nai Yisrael being chosen through the Giving of the Torah, they are instruments to draw near the converts, because B'nai Yisrael are called the First of His Crop which is the fruit for which everything was created. This is as it says (Gen. R.), "B'reishit -- for the sake of Israel which is called 'reishit.'" The meaning is that "reishit" is the beginning and the inner essence, as it says (Prov.), "The 'reishit' of wisdom is the awe of God." Therefore it is called the Day of Bikkurim, when the fruit is ripe. But B'nai Yisrael "are excepted from the generality in order to teach to the entire generality" (Sifra, principles of R' Yishma'el), as it will be in the future (Zeph. 3:9), "For then I will make the peoples pure of speech, etc. [so that they all invoke Adonai by name and serve Him with one accord]." And then (Eccl. 7:8) "The end of a matter is better than the beginning of it" [see Ruth 3:10]. And in truth, according as B'nai Yisrael elevate from the nations, they are themselves exalted even more. And this itself is the meaning of putting "na'aseh" before "nishma," for B'nai Yisrael understood this, that they were chosen in order to draw everyone near, and they said (Ex. 24:7), "Everything that Adonai has spoken we will do." It is written here "na'aseh" and it is written there (Gen. 1:26), "Na'aseh adam," as it says (Gen. 12:5) "the souls that they had made," which Onkelos translated "that they had subjugated to the Torah", and it is through this that "we will hear." As it is with the particular -- as the improvement [tikkun] of the deeds, in order to draw each physical deed close to the spirit so that the soul shines in the person -- so it is in general -- as the improvement [tikkun] of K'lal Yisrael to draw near from the nations, so that the Torah shines in them. It is written (Micah 7:20), "You will give truth to Ya'akov, hesed to Avraham," for B'nai Yisrael are in truth God's portion and His Torah, but it is also part of the aspect of Truth to do hesed, to bring near those who are far off and who come for the sake of Heaven: "truth to Ya'akov" is the Torah, "hesed to Avraham" is that we should draw close also from the descendants of Lot -- Ruth the Moabite....

"May God show you favor." The Midrash asks (Bamidbar_Rabbah.11.7): but doesn't the Torah elsewhere say Hashem does not play favorites, אשר לא ישא פנים ולא יקח שוחד? Answer: this verse applies when we do God's will, and this verse applies when we don't. Sfas Emes asks: but when we're doing God's will, why would we even need favoritism? Answer: it means may God count a little as if it were a lot. (A Midrash (Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nasso.10) also says, in connection with our verse, that Hashem says, "My people show extra favor to Me! I said to recite a blessing when they eat to satisfaction, but they recite a blessing even on an olive-size morsel of food." So you see this is what it means to show extra favor: rejoicing in the tiniest opportunity and counting it as significant.) And it depends on how the person sees it. If a person rejoices at being able to do God's will even in a small way, then God too finds that mitzvah immensely precious. This rejoicing is an expression of the person's innermost essence. And this is what it means וישם לך שלום. Shleimus, completeness, is that innermost point of truth, whose radiance, even the tiniest ray, contains its everything. God is called Shalom; that means God is the completeness of all that exists. When our focus is God's will, that means we're focusing on that innermost point of a mitzvah which is its everything. It's shleimus. The size of a mitzvah is irrelevant when you focus on this essence, on doing God's will.

The prayer of Moshe our teacher peace be upon him to enter the land and was not answered positively. It seems that it was to elevate all the prayers of the Children of Israel that weren't able [the prayers] to go up. All those ineffective prayers had a fixing needed, and this happened through this prayer. And it was all with a certain measure, since Moshe our teacher peace be upon him sacrificed his life for the Children of Israel and even this request of going up to the Land of Israel was also only for the goodness of the Children of Israel. Because he knew that if those prayers did not make it in, the Children of Israel would destroy their own ways, as it is written "if while I am still living etc" (Deut. 31:27). Therefore, this prayer was helpful to the Children of Israel, even if his request was not responded positively, the prayer was not for nothing, God forbid.

(Deuteronomy.5.19) "The Lord spoke those words to all of your congregation." The word 'all of' seems superfluous. The implication: 
This verse applies to all congregations, whenever Jews gather, in all times. As the Sages said, (Pirkei_Avot.3.6) "When ten sit together and occupy themselves with Torah, the Shechinah abides among them." 
This reality came into being at the time the Torah was given. As it says (Deuteronomy.4.10), "Gather the people to Me that I may let them hear My words" -- this was the needed preparation and illumination so that every gathering of Jews for all generations has the ability to awaken those words. As it says (Deuteronomy.5.19, see Targum): "A mighty voice that never stopped." 
Just as the 'Ten Utterances' form the foundation and structure for all of Creation, so too the Ten Commandments are the foundation and structure for all the future of the Jewish People. The only difference is that the 'Utterances' were by the will of the Creator alone, while the Commandments were also by the readiness of the Jewish People, when they said "We will do" first, before "We will hear," and gave their lives for the glory of His blessed Name. Accordingly, today, as well, this power is awakened by man's readiness. 
Similarly, within the individual person, when he gathers all his powers to submit willingly to God, he is included under 'all of your congregation.' Thus we find (Pirkei_Avot.3.6) "And how do we know that even if one [sits and studies, the Shechinah is present]."

Section 9



Explanation of “and you shall love”: “Whom else have I in heaven?” The philosophers raise a difficult: how is it appropriate to command love? But the truth is that B'nei Yisrael have in their core a connection and deep attachment to the One God. And that is what meant by what’s written “Whom else have I in heaven?” He is the Source; only below are their other wills. And through the daily acceptance of the yoke of heaven, “And having You, I want no one on earth.” And through this we can awaken love in this world as well. 

Section 10



Section 11



Section 12



Section 13



The verse says (Deuteronomy.6.5-6) "You shall love the Lord your God... And these words shall be upon your heart." Sifri and Rashi explain: "What is this love? By taking these words to heart, you will come to recognize the Holy One blessed be He, and cleave to His ways."
This means: this love is the Torah, and the Holy One has ingrained these words into each Jewish soul. As it says (Deuteronomy.5.19), "The Lord spoke these words to all of your congregation... a mighty voice that *never stopped*." For all time, every Jew has the ability to find in his heart words of Torah. As it says (Megillah.6b) "If someone says to you 'I have struggled and I have found success,' -- believe him."
This is *the fire of love* of which it says (Song_of_Songs.8.7) "Many waters cannot quench the love." As we find (Sotah 21a), "A sin extinguishes a mitzvah, but does not extinguish Torah." (The Sages (Vayikra_Rabbah.2.3) similarly expounded the verse (Jeremiah.31.20) "A darling child to Me is Ephraim... whenever I just speak with him" -- "sufficient is My Speaking that I placed within him.") And it says (Jeremiah.23.29) "My words are like fire, declares the Lord."
This Torah that God gave us is testimony that He loves us, as it says (in the blessing before the morning Shema) "Who chooses His nation Israel with love." And with this power we can find love in our hearts for God's blessed Name.
This love is not dependent on anything, as it says (Deuteronomy 7.7-8), "Not because you are more numerous than all the nations did the Lord want you and choose you... but by the Lord's love for you." That means it is love that is unconditional -- it is simply (Deuteronomy.32.9) "for the Lord's portion is His people."
We find that in a time of sinning it says (Jeremiah.12.8), "She raised her voice against Me, therefore I rejected her" -- the hatred is only by cause. When the cause becomes canceled, the hatred disappears. The love, in contrast, is intrinsic, absolute. So it says (Hoshea.14.5), "I will love them freely."
In the haftarah ('Comfort, comfort My people') it says (Isaiah.40.6-8), "What shall I proclaim? All flesh is grass." The Sages teach (Perek Shirah 1.49) that the fly declares this when Jews are not occupied with Torah. And the response: "Grass withers, flowers fade, but the word of our God stands forever!" For no sin can extinguish Torah.
Sins cause the love to be hidden temporarily. But ultimately, "Grass withers, flowers fade, but the word of our God stands forever."

In the midrash Tanchuma "this day, Hashem, etc, commands you to do the decrees etc let us sing etc bow and kneel etc Moshe our teacher, peace be upon him, saw that in the future there would be no more first fruits, and so he established prayer etc" (Midrash Tanchuma, Ki Tavo 1:1). My master, my father, my elder, my teacher, my rabbi may his memory be for a blessing said that the explanation [for this midrash] is that prayer is also giving the first/best to the Holy Blessed One every day, just as the first fruits, see there (Pri Tzadik, Ki Tavo 9:1). Yet an explanation of the pertinence to "this day" is still needed. And in the midrash and in Rashi they explained: "this day[the mitzvot] should be in your eyes as new every day." And is it possible that a person would desire to make mistakes even if in truth there is no renewal, Heaven forfend? Yet, a person has the power to renew everything, since obviously there is in every thing the aspect of renewal, behold, the Holy Blessed One renews Creation continuously every day, and the explanation is that continuously means every moment. And also, there is no thing that doesn't have Liveness from the Holy Blessed One, and the Point from God forever, and so it can't become old since God's words are alive and flow constantly. However, when darkness covers the face of the land the external husks hides the Flowing Point. And this is why it is written "there is nothing new under the sun", and this is nature and this world, that hide the renewal. However, a person has the strength to illuminate the Point from the darkness, and this is why it is written "this day the One commands you to do" - meaning, to find the aspect of "this day" which is the uncovering and revealing the light, in the aspect of Mirror of Light. This is also true within an action, which can be what hides said Point. And this [revealing the Point] is done through mitzvot, since "a mitzvah is light" (Prov. 6:23), since a mitzvah is a physical action and it contains the Liveness of the Holy Blessed One, in the command to do it, in the strength of a person to cling oneself to the Hidden Light through the action of doing a mitzvah, as explained above and as I wrote in other places. And what is written "the decrees etc" which is to say through the mitzvot of the Blessed One, you are given strength to find the aspect of "this day" also in an action. And this is also the aspect of Shabbat, since it is written "to make the Shabbat" (Exodus 31:16). And the explanation of my grandfather, my elder, my teacher and rabbi, of blessed memory, [on the verse] "faces east" (Ezekiel 46:1) is as the issue that is written "the children of Israel came first in thought", see there (Chiddushei HaRim on Torah, Eikev 4:4). And it is as we explained above, that on Shabbat the Source and the Root from which New Aliveness continuously flows to all creatures is revealed. And one could also say that this is the explanation for "they are crowned with new souls" (Siddur Sefard, Shabbat Eve Maariv, Shabbat Eve Maariv 3), that the Aliveness is renewed in the souls of the children of Israel. And the explanation of "to make the Shabbat" is that we need to bring the aspect of renewal from the Shabbat to the days of making [ie, the week] as it is written in Sha'ar haKedusha, see there, and also as it is written in other places, that on Shabbat one opens the other days of the week through the aspect of Shabbat, as explained. And according to what a person sorts out and clarifies Aliveness in every thing, and in that person's eyes they are like new, truly Renewal is revealed to that person, and this is what is written: If you listened [shamo’a] to the old,  then you will listen [tishma] to the new (Berakhot 40a), since given that one believes that there is an aspect of the Holy Blessed One hidden in every thing even in the most external, then one merits to reveal the internal, as we explained. And so too "we will bow and kneel" - meaning, bowing is one's desire to surrender, and kneeling, is a nif'al verb, which means that according to the will, truly one merits to reveal the truth, to surrender to the real, real truth.

Sukkot 5637
In the verse (Lev. 23:43), "In order that [your future generations] may learn that I made [the Israelites] live in sukkot," and the verse (Jer. 2:2), "I remembered to your favor the lovingkindness [hesed] of your youth [... How you followed Me in the wilderness]," the general idea of the matter is that in Nisan Hashem brought us out of Egypt, and it was through Hashem's lovingkindness alone, as it is written (Ezek. 16:7), "And you were naked and bare."  However, Hashem wanted that this lovingkindness be through the merit of good deeds of the Israelites, so that it would endure forever.  And so it is written (Ps. 62:13), "The lovingkindness is yours, Lord, for You will repay each person according to his deeds."  The meaning is that the Holy One, blessed be He, engineers through His lovingkindness that the person merits this lovingkindness on his own, through his or her own deeds, for everything is ultimately attributable to the Cause of all causes.  And this happened afterwards in that the Israelites traveled into the wilderness and merited the clouds of glory.  The meaning is that the fact that they merited this through their own deeds removes the Accuser from B'nai Yisrael; "One who eats what is not his, feels ashamed [to look in the face of his benefactor]" (Yerushalmi, Orlah 1:3), but one who merits through his own deeds is honored.  And see what I have said below [in another piece from Sukkot the same year].  And this matter appears every year.  At Pesah there is the exodus from Egypt through Hashem's lovingkindness.  And afterwards, at Rosh Hashana, a person is judged with regard to whether he has repaired his deeds the lovingkindness.  For all of Hashem's lovingkindness is so that a person will repair his deeds by means of the lovingkindness.  And when he merits by right, the lovingkindness winds up being repaid, even according to the criterion of justice [midat hadin].  And this is the lovingkindness of the holiday of Sukkot -- the lovingkindness that comes by right.  All of this happened to our ancestors, and this is why it says, "I remembered to your favor the lovingkindness of your youth [... How you followed Me in the wilderness]"  The meaning is that the Holy One, blessed be He, caused the lovingkindness to be remembered throughout the generations in that it was on account of Israel's own good deeds, and the remembering is by right.  The meaning is that lovingkindness is just for a moment, except that, for one who merits that lovingkindness by right, it endures forever.  (And this is "[I will make with you an everlasting covenant,] The enduring lovingkindness promised to David.")  And this why it says, "I made [the Israelites] live in sukkot," for even the sukkot are a reminder of the exodus from Egypt, but they are a reminder of the lovingkindness that was done through the merit of B'nai Yisrael, etc.  And in this way the question of the Tur [why Sukkot is observed in the Fall rather than in Nisan] is resolved.

On the eighth day, there shall be a convocation for you: For there is Hallel and joy on eight. And they expounded, "'And you shall be altogether happy' (Deuteronomy 16:15) - to include the [night of] the eighth, etc." As the joy needs to be for the sake of the Heavens. And the hint [to this] is that there is Hallel and joy on eight. For the eighth is above the nature that is in the seven days of building. And it is written (Jeremiah 9:22-23), "Let not one glory... But let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me." And that is Shmini Atzeret; and for that reason this day has no point of contact with any [other] nation. As on the seven days of Sukkot, there is joy from the angle of nature, but on Shmini Atzeret, it is the root of joy, as mentioned above. And there is a hint in the verse (Proverbs 25:14), "Like clouds and wind without rain, so is one who vaunts himself over a false gift." For in the first seven days there are clouds and wind - the sukkah (hut) is clouds of glory and we wave the four species to the four winds (<i>ruchot</i>, which is usually understood here as directions). So because of that, there is something for everyone to grab. But the rain that is on Shmini Atzeret was only given over to people of truth, for the joy and Hallel is in it (eight), as mentioned above. Hence, "without rain is one who vaunts himself over a false gift," are the nations of the world except for the Children of Israel, who are rooted in joy. To them is rain given. And the essence of rain is Torah, which is compared to rainfall, since it quenches the hearts of the Children of Israel, like rain quenches the land. Hence the internality of rain is Torah, and the Children of Israel cling to internality; so they are the internality of the Creation. And enlightenment in the Torah comes to them and simple rain comes to the superficial ones. And likewise that which is said, "On the festival, they are judged about water" - internally that is Torah, which is called water. And that is why the Children of Israel merit enlightenment of the Torah on the festival. And the judgement is whether they are fit to receive enlightenment of the Torah. As it is written (Psalms 51:12), "Create a pure heart for me," and then, "renew a steadfast spirit." For a person has to request a pure heart in order to be a vessel that is prepared to receive the Torah. And during these days when the hearts of the Children of Israel are purified, they automatically feel the enlightenment of the Torah afterwards. And with this, the verse (Ezekiel 38:25), "I will sprinkle pure water upon you," is fulfilled. And since everything is in any event dependent upon the internal, the Children of Israel have the choice part also in the external flow. This is like the matter that the Sages, may their memory be blessed, expounded on the verse (Numbers 23:9), "a people which shall dwell alone and will not be reckoned among the nations" - as they eat and drink with the nations, but it does not get reckoned in the tally. And the reason is because this is not their major comfort; rather their main comfort is Torah. And in the Mishnah (Avot 5:19): "What [difference] is there between the students of Abraham, our father, etc. [they] eat in this world and inherit the next world." The inheritance is the essence of the principal, whereas they eat from the fruits in this world. And likewise during the days of Sukkot, that is called eating in this world, however it is nevertheless not reckoned. But on Shmini Atzeret, it is called inheriting the next world. And so, "which shall dwell alone," is fulfilled, as it written, "there shall be a convocation for you." And the three traits of the students of Abraham, our father, are fulfilled in the Jewish people in these days. For on Rosh Hashanah, it is the humble spirit, as it is said, "the commandment [of the shofar ideally] is with the bent." And on Yom Kippur, it is the small appetite , as it is written, "you shall afflict your souls." And on Sukkot, is is the good eye, as they offer [sacrifices] for the 70 nations. That is why they merit the reward to eat in this world and inherit the next world, as mentioned above.

On the eighth day, this is an Atzeret for you – a gathering in. For Sukkot is the Festival of ingathering. And the Children of Israel, when they bring themselves together in the name of heaven – in order that their should descent upon the Succah the name of heaven, their end shall be that they shall sustain and remain in this state of Achdut/Oneness. And this is the meaning of this is an Atzeret for you – that you should remain in Oneness. And so all gatherings, this is their explanation – if they gather for the sake of heaven, they shall remain sustained even as each one goes to their own home. And so to on the holy Shabbat – they are drawn into Oneness, and if this is for the sake of heaven, they shall so be sustained in the days of action. So too the Oneness from Sukkot goes with us also home.
