Paragraph 1


















And this is as the Scripture states <b>"beyond the river dwelt your ancestors from olden times; Terach, the father of Avraham" (Yehoshua 24:2). That is to say, Terach the father of Avraham, his dwelling and his level was in the attribute of "beyond the river", which is, the second side of the river, to perform evil deeds [<i>chasadim hara'im</i>] in the world. "But I took your father Avraham from beyond the river" (Yehoshua 24:3) - from that level itself of "beyond the river" I took Avraham, to the other, opposite side: to do and to increase good deeds in the world [<i>chasadim tovim</i>]. And this is a great and wondrous level, the attribute of one who is forgiving [lit. "passes over their traits"], who the Sages of blessed memory praised (Ta'anit 25b:5). Since They took evil attributes and reversed their attributes to be made into good attributes, regarding this the Scripture says (Yirmiyahu 15:19) "If you produce what is noble out of the worthless, you shall be like My mouth". And our Sages of blessed memory said (Bava Metzia 85a) that even if the Holy Blessed One decrees a decree, They will nullify it for the sake of such a one. And behold, our sages of blessed memory said, blood is spoiled up and made into milk (Niddah 9a), as it is said "Who will make pure from impure?" (Iyov 14:4). And they explained it, that the impure blood alone, it itself is spoiled and made into pure milk. Regarding this it says "Who will make pure from impure?" -- like Avraham from Terach, from the impurity of Terach, Terach himself who was accustomed to do evil deeds in the world and to make known matters of idolatry, how to serve every different idol: from this impurity itself Avraham reversed and made it pure, and taught the people the ways of God and converted the converts, as it is said!</b>

Paragraph 1


And what appears [correct] to me about this is that it is well known that the secret of the commandment of circumcision is very, very deep - 'who can find it?' And it is greater than all of the positive commandments in the Torah, since there is no commandment from all of the 248 positive commandments for which one is liable excision besides [eating the] Pesach sacrifice and circumcision; and thirteen covenants were sealed upon it; and the essence of creation rests upon it - as per the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed (Nedarim 31b), "Rabbi said, etc. Great is circumcision, for were it not for circumcision, the Holy One, blessed be He, would not have created His world - as it is stated (Jeremiah 33:26), 'If it were not for my covenant day and night, I would not have made the laws of heaven and earth.'" For the whole matter of the creation of the worlds was to impact on the creatures with His goodness, to give over from the radiance of His blessing to the world. Yet the whole time the circumcision is covered with the foreskin, the kindnesses cannot descend into the Foundation (<i>Yesod</i>), in order that the external forces not draw sustenance from them, such that no enlightenment comes out from it. So all of the worlds are impacted by harsh judgements (as it is found in the words of the Ari about the intention of circumcision). Hence the world cannot endure with the negation of circumcision. And that is why Scripture stated (Malachi  2:5), "My covenant was with him for life and peace." As every aspect of life - which is the essence of the endurance of creation - is all through the aspect of circumcision. And therefore the numerical count (<i>gemartria</i>) of <i>brit</i> is nine times life (<i>chaim</i>) - since it is in the aspect of the Foundation (associated with circumcision) which is the ninth trait going downwards and the aspect of life descends from every trait to the aspect of the Foundation, and it is the [trait] that gives the bounty of life to those that come to the world. And it is well known from the words of the Ari that the name of the Foundation is peace, because it creates peace among all the traits and every aspect of the kindnesses and the restrictions descend into it. So the restrictions are grouped into the kindnesses there and are sweetened there. And that is why it stated, "My covenant was with him for life and peace" - it is to say that the aspects of life and peace are with the aspect of the covenant, since the whole aspects of life and peace receives their bounty from it, as stated. And that is why thirteen covenants were sealed upon it, to hint to the one aspect within which all the traits unite and which unifies them into one. For it is 'a ladder planted towards the ground and its head reaches to the heavens.' As the bounty that descends upon it descends from a high and very awesome place, the hidden Mind, the Source of mercy and kindnesses, the aspect of the thirteen attributes of mercy. And that is why thirteen covenants were sealed upon it.

Lot could see that the angels didn't want to do anything until he left the city.  He thought that since the decree of destruction did not fall upon him, he would be able to withhold the destruction from entering the city (of Sodom) by not leaving it. 
He, therefore, delayed a bit because he thought that the people of Sodom would repent and not be destroyed.
The angels knew that it was the opposite- the punishment wouldn't be delayed because of Lot, and that he would also be consumed by the sins of the city held him and took him out.  The reason for his salvation is because G-d took pity on him - he wasn't able to prevent the destruction, and it was enough for Lot to save himself once he left the city.

Paragraph 21

<b>Moshe agreed</b> to reside, etc. and he gave his daughter, Tzipporah, to Moshe: And at first glance, the word, "to Moshe," is extra; and it should have said, "and he gave him, Tzipporah, his daughter." Indeed, when Scripture says that he gave his daughter, Tzipporah, to Moshe, it is saying that this was like Moshe's intention of taking this this one from all of his daughters. For she had appeared individually to him. And it also seems that it can be said that even Yitro knew that Tzipporah was fit for Moshe, since he was a great sage. That is why it said, "And he gave." Meaning that he gave Tzipporah, because he knew she was his [proper] mate. And hence he gave his daughter, Tzipporah, to Moshe; meaning she was the one fitting for the level of Moshe. For she was the most proper of women, 'maidens see and acclaim her, etc.'
<b>Also</b> its saying, "Moshe agreed. etc. and he gave his daughter, Tzipporah, etc.," is, in this way, to express our teacher Moshe's great modesty, peace be upon him. As even though Tzipporah ran after him like a bird (<i>tzippor</i>) and he knew clearly that that she was his mate, since she appeared individually to him at the well -  nevertheless, he did not request her from [Yitro]; he did not claim his portion with his mouth and did not speak about this at all. Rather he desired to stay with him until things developed from the Heavens, [that] they would automatically give him Tzipporah. And so it was: During the days of his stay, behold Yitro himself 'gave him his daughter, Tzipporah,' to him, without a request from the mouth [of Moshe]. This was not even like our father, Yaakov, peace be upon him - who said, in order to father children (Genesis 29:18), "I will work for you seven years for Rachel, etc." - and that which is similar. But he, due to his great modesty, did not say anything. And that is why Scripture says later...

Paragraph 28

<b>The waters returned and covered the chariots, etc. including Pharaoh’s entire army, etc. not one of them remained:</b> At first glace, this is repetitive language. After it stated, "including the entire army, etc.," why did it repeat and state, "[none] remained, etc.?" Indeed, however, Scripture is reporting an amazing miracle with this. For have we not already written that the return of the water was while Israel was still in the sea and the sea was split into pieces, such that in one part, He brought through the Israelites within it; and in another part, 'He hurled Pharaoh and his army, etc.!' And that is why the splitting of the Red Sea in the words of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, is always called difficult. Like they said (Sotah 2a), "Pairing them up is as difficult as splitting the Red Sea," and that which is similar to it. All of this is [about] the essence of its splitting, that it was cut into halves. As He made a half, sea; and [the other] half dry land - punishment and mercy - at one instant. And that is difficult before the Holy One, blessed be He - as it is found in the holy Zohar (Vayera 113b), "There was miracle and punishment as one." See there, that it spoke at length about this aspect. And, if so, it comes out that if this was indeed the commandment to the sea - to scramble the Egyptians while the Israelites were still within it - it is certain that it did not delay the words of the Holy One, blessed be He. Rather, immediately when one of the Egyptians came into the sea, the water would come over him and wash him away. Likewise, the second and the third, until the were finished. And such is implied in the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, that we cited above. As they said (Shemot Rabbah 22:2), "When the last of the Israelites ascended from the sea, the last of the Egyptians descended into it." Behold that they were entering one by one; and likewise were they washed away one by one. But, at first glance, how was the understanding of Egypt so wanting and their wisdom so depraved? As the second one saw with his eyes that the first one was washed away into the sea and he yet went in after him, likewise the third and the fourth. However it was already not their will and their intellect that did this. It is like the statement of the Sages, may their memory be blessed (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1:9:6 on "to a mare in Pharaoh’s chariots"), "The waves of the sea appeared like female horses and [the horses of] Egypt were like aroused stallions, and they pursued them until they sank them in the sea. The Egyptian would say to his horse, 'Yesterday, I would drag you to the Nile and you would not follow me; and now, you are sinking me in the sea?' The horse would say to its rider (Exodus 15:1), '"He cast into the sea (<i>rama bayam</i>)" - see what is in the sea (<i>reu ma bayam</i>),' etc." And that is why it stated, "The waters returned and covered the chariots (a noun form that is usually singular, chariot)." The understanding is that one chariot, the first chariot that came into the sea was washed away; "including Pharaoh’s entire army," which came from behind. That is to say, this was also done to Pharaoh's entire army. Once they came into the sea, they were immediately washed away. And nevertheless, not even "one of them remained," outside. Rather, they all went into the sea, even though they saw the first ones drowning. It was not in the power of the rider to stop the chariot, that it not descend [into the sea]. He was driven against his will and drowned in the depths, as mentioned.
