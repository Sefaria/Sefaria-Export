The Israelites shall camp each with his standard, under the banners of their ancestral house; (Bamidbar 2:2) May we shout for joy in your victory, arrayed by flags in the name of our Gd. (Tehillim 20:6) The Explanation of that verse is someone who hasn’t got up to this attribute; several days and weeks have passed and during the days of the Sefira, they have not managed to improve anything.  How can they ascent the Mountain of Gd on the holy festival? However when you unite with your creator and you don’t do something for your own sake it is possible to skip ledaleg  that is why it says (Shir Hashirim 2:4) his flag of love was over me  Do not read it as their ‘flag’ diglo rather their ‘skipping’ dilugo; When this person serves with love it is possible to jump to the highest level even though it is not following the usual order…
Since we are doing it not for our own sake but for our Gd – then we are able to skip to the highest level

And behold, the ese three characteristics, that are bashful, merciful, and performers of kindness - we find their opposites in thise who are divided from the community of Israel. For the attribute of kindness is nonexistent in all other nations, as it is written "chesed to the nations is a sin" (Mishlei 14:34). And the attribute of mercifulness is not in the Giv'onim, who are the Netinim, who did not have mercy on the sons of Sha'ul. And the attribute of bashfulness is not found in mamzerim, as it is written "and a harlot's forehead" (Yirmiyahu 3:3). And it also says, "any arrogant priest is from these" [servants who assimilated into the priesthood] (Kiddushin 70b).
