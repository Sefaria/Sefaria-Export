Mareh Yechezkel on Torah

Bereshit

<b>In the beginning, God created, etc.:</b> In the Tikkunim (Tikkunei Zohar 90a:8), it is said, “Shabbat was there, circumcision was there.” The explanation of this is that it is known that the world was created for three things, and they are the world, the year and the soul (Sefer Yetzirah 6). The world is the heavens and the earth and all of their hosts; the year is time; and the soul is the soul of man – and they all include each other. And behold the author of the Ikkarim (Sefer HaIkkarim, Maamar 1:1), based his book on three fundamental principles. [The first is] the existence of God – meaning that it is necessary to know that there is a Being that runs the world and supervises it and that all actions are recorded in a book. The second is that there is a divine Torah, through which one will know the actions that are proper to do in the eyes of God and those which one must be careful to refrain from doing. And the third is that there is reward and punishment, to believe that there is remuneration for one’s deeds, such that he will need to give an account and reckoning if he transgresses the will of his Maker. And without these three, the purpose of man will not be fulfilled.  
And these three correspond to the three [items] mentioned previously. For we can recognize the existence of God, by way of the heavens and the earth. This is like their statement, may their memory be blessed, “When Avraham died, [God] hung [Avraham’s healing stone] upon the sphere of the sun” (Bava Batra 16b); and like the Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 2:2), “and when [a person] will think of all these matters, and those like them, he will be taken aback and stricken with awe.” And it is like David said, “When I behold Your heavens, etc. (Psalms 8:4). And knowledge of the truth of the Torah is [attained] by way of circumcision. For the Jewish people are one of [God’s] acquisitions (Pesachim 87b), since we were acquired by him as His slaves – and it is customary that when one acquires a slave for life, a tag is placed upon [that slave]. And since we are his slaves, we are obligated to do [His will] – as it is written, “today upon your hearts,” such that they should be in your eyes like new items every day (Deuteronomy 6:6 with Rashi) –  just like we run to find out a [new] decree of a king. And hence circumcision (<i>brit</i>) has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematriya</i>) of 612; and with [the addition of] this commandment, itself, it adds up to 613. Therefore, one who rejects idolatry is as if he assents to the entire Torah (Kiddushin 40a); as the main thing is that he takes on the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven upon himself – ‘and the rest is commentary.’ And the third is [knowledge of the existence of] reward and punishment; and it is felt by way of the Shabbat, which is ‘a taste of the world to come, the day of Shabbat rest.’ And therefore Scripture opened with, “In the beginning,” to hint about the three of them together, since they are the purpose of existence – the creation and the day came ‘together with circumcision.’  
In the beginning (<i>Bereshit</i>) is a covenant/circumcision of fire (<i>brit esh</i>, which is made up of the same letters as <i>bereshit</i>, Zohar Chadash, Bereshit 276-280). This is in accordance with that which is written (Genesis 1:26), “Let Us make man,” in the plural. As it is found in the Gemara, that they asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Channaniah, “Why was man not created circumcised?” And the reason is that for everything, there must be arousal from below by a human action; and then one merits assistance from the heavens. Hence by way of our being engaged with the commandment of circumcision, which is a major action, we give the child the merit with which to have a holy soul and a heart circumcised for Torah.
And that is the meaning of that which is written, “Let Us make man.” Meaning to say, in partnership [with man], by way of the act of circumcision from below. And that is the meaning of that which was said (Yevamot 61a), “[Jews] are called Adam (a man).” Meaning to say, it is [like] the expression, “I will resemble (<i>edameh</i>) the Most High” (Isaiah 14:14) – for he takes the image of God upon himself. And that is the meaning of that which is written in the Midrash (Avot D'Rabbi Natan 2:5), “Adam (the first man) was born circumcised, as it is stated (Genesis 1:24), ‘And God created man (Adam) in His image.’” And that is why this commandment is hinted to at the beginning of the parasha, with the expression, “<i>Bereshit</i>” - <i>bet reshit</i> (two beginning[s]). That is that the Torah is called, the beginning; and circumcision is also [the beginning, in that] it is the first commandment of a man. “And the end of a matter is better than (<i>tov me</i> the beginning of it” (Ecclesiastes 7:8) – meaning to say, when he is good from (<i>tov me</i>) his beginning.
And in the songs of Shabbat (<i>zemirot</i>), we find, “One who keeps the Shabbat – a boy and a girl (<i>bat</i>) – [will be accepted] like a meal offering on the griddle (<i>machbat</i>).” I was asked what is the connection of a boy and a girl to this; also why did it not mention the incense which is more beloved [than a meal offering]? And even though it worked as a rhyme scheme, there is nevertheless surely an explanation for this. And it appears to me that it is [explained] according to that which is written concerning a poor person [who is being purified from <i>tzaraat</i>] (Leviticus 14:32), “whose means are not sufficient in his purification.” And at first glance, this is a wonder – what can he do that about not being able to bring [the full sacrifice]? Why should he be called, someone who is not able to purify himself? (Editor’s note: The question is based on a homiletical reading of the verse. In fact, the verse is simply describing this person, as someone whose means did not suffice for the full sacrifice, but is nevertheless completely purified with what he brings.)
And the idea is that there are four levels [of existence] – the [totally] inanimate, that which grows, the animate and that which speaks. The inanimate only has one function and that is [existence]. And that which grows has two functions – [existence] and growth. And with the animate, there is yet another function – it has [existence], growth and animation. However that which speaks – meaning man – has all four functions. And so when man sins, he damages all of the four groups - the inanimate, that which grows, the animate and that which speaks. And that is why he must bring a sacrifice that will go up as ‘a fire of a pleasing smell to the Lord (<i>eeshe riach nichoach laHashem</i>).” For these four words correspond to the four letters of God’s name. That is, that the priest that offers it is the one that speaks, the sacrifice is the animate, the meal offering is that which grows and the serving instruments are the inanimate. And behold that these four correspond to God’s four-letter name. That is that the one that speaks corresponds to the <i>yod</i>; the animate corresponds to the <i>hay</i>, and so forth for all of them. Hence concerning a poor person who is [being purified from <i>tzaraat</i> and] is unable to bring an animal sacrifice but only a meal offering, he did not rectify all of the letters of the name, but rather only the <i>vav</i> and the final <i>hay</i> – which are the worlds of formation and of action. (Nevertheless Scripture has mercy upon him to purify him.) Hence he is called, someone who is not able to purify himself.
It is well known that Shabbat corresponds to the final <i>hay</i> of God’s name, and that it is called, a daughter. And anyone that observes Shabbat ‘merits the inheritance of Yaakov’ – as is well known. And Yaakov is the <i>vav</i> of the name, and is also called, son – as is elucidated in several places. And that is the meaning of that which is sung, “One who keeps the Shabbat” – who merits to raise up the <i>vav</i> and the <i>hay</i> of the name – which is, “a boy and a girl – will be accepted like a meal offering on the griddle.” That is because it is only from the inanimate and from that which grows – which also only correspond to the <i>vav</i> and the <i>hay</i> of the name. Yet the Holy One, blessed be He, accepts it willingly. And in another place, I explained that this song has seven rhyming stanzas which hint to the seven characteristics (see Avot 6:8). ‘And knowledge comes easily to the intelligent man.’  
<i>Said the one who brought this to the printers: Since many precious pearls of wisdom on the Torah, and especially on Parashat Bereshit, were lost from the holy manuscripts of the author, may his merit protect us – alas, for those that are gone – I therefore saw fit to copy a sermon about this parasha here from the holy writings of the author’s son:</i>
From the son of the author, the great rabbi, etc., our teacher, Chaim Betzalel of Tasnad, may the memory of the righteous be for a blessing:
<b>Sermon on Parashat Bereshit</b><br><b>In Midrash Tehillim, it says,</b> “’The beginning of Your words gives light’ (Psalms 119:130) – the beginning of Your words in the Creation was (Genesis 1:3), ‘Let there be light’; From there, ‘You make the fools understand,’ and they will begin with words of Torah” – and Rashi on Psalms cites this midrash. And it appears that his words can be elucidated according to the Mishnah (Avot 5:1), “With ten utterances the world was created, etc.” And see the book, Orchot Tzaddikim, as he explains that the teacher [of this mishnah] had two questions: One is, what was the benefit of having informed us that the world was created with ten utterances? And also, why was it created with ten utterances? And he answered about the first question, that an evildoer should know to be careful not to sin – for his punishment will be great, since he is destroying the world that was created with ten utterances. And about the second question, he answered that it is to give a goodly reward to the righteous. But that itself is difficult – why should the evildoer be punished with a severe punishment? As what does it matter that it was created with ten utterances, was He not able to have created it with one utterance? For if a craftsman makes a utensil in ten days that he could have made in a day, is his payment any greater as a result; and does one who breaks it have to pay any more? Likewise is it difficult – why should the righteous receive any more reward [as a result of this]? And see what he writes.
And it appears to me [that it can be explained] according to [Rashi’s] approach. And along the way, we will be exacting about the expression, “a goodly reward.” For is there a reward that is not goodly? And it appears that this is in accordance with that which he wrote (Rashi on Genesis 1:1:3), “At first, it came up in [God’s] thought to create the world with the attribute of strict justice, [but] He saw that the world could not endure like this. Hence He had the attribute of mercy join with the attribute of strict justice.” And this requires study. For what did He think at first; and what did He think at the end? For behold there is no variance in front of Him, may His name be blessed. And it appears at first glance that according to strict justice, a man could not seek and claim reward in the world to come for his good deeds that he did. For ‘who has a claim on Me from before, that I should repay him?’ And it is as the commentators have written (that man was preceded by all of God’s gifts that enable him to fulfill the commandments, such that he could really do nothing on his own without them). And if so – according to that which the commentators [also] wrote, that the reason for the creation of man is that by man’s acquiring [fulfillment of] commandments in this world, the delight that he will receive [in the world to come] will not be ‘bread of embarrassment’ – based on what we have just said, that even after fulfilling commandments in this world, one cannot make a just claim [for reward], the question reverts to its place! For also before man was created, the soul experienced delight in the place of its source – if so, what was the advantage of creating it?
But it appears that [it is because] the world was created with the joining of the attribute of mercy to the attribute of strict judgement. Hence His wisdom, may His name be blessed, decreed that the reward for [fulfilling] a commandment not be paid in this world under any circumstance, so that one’s reward for [fulfilling] commandments be saved for him in its entirety for the world to come. And that which the Holy One, blessed be He, has goodness flow upon a man in this world is [only] from the angle of kindness; and it is a gift that He gives to him. And perhaps this is the meaning of that which the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe (Exodus 33:15), “I will make all My goodness pass over you” – its understanding is that all of the reward for [fulfillment of] commandments will be preserved and saved for the world to come; but in this world, He will have [that] reward pass over him, such that ‘there is none in this world.’ And that [good] which He has flow in this world is a free gift – and that is the meaning of “and the grace that I grant.” And that is from that which “I will proclaim before you the name, Lord” – that is the trait of mercy (traditionally associated with that name) that the Lord, may He be blessed, uses in this world. And according to that which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 7a) that the question of Moshe, peace be upon him, was why is there a righteous person that has bad occur to him – the Holy One, blessed be He, answered that it is because I give a free present to the completely righteous, to the one that I can give [a full] reward in the next world (as he has no sins that require a deduction from the full reward). But regarding one who is not completely righteous, it is mercy if I punish him a little in this world, in order that I can have mercy upon him (and give him a full reward) in the world to come.  
And behold, the purpose of every thing is called [its] beginning. And that is the meaning of that which he wrote, “At first, it came up in [God’s] thought” – that the purpose that came up in thought before Him, may His name be blessed, was to create the world with the attribute of strict justice, such that [man] receive his reward in the world to come according to strict justice, such that it not be, ‘bread of embarrassment.’ But in order that a claimant not come to argue and say, “Did he not already receive his reward in the world” – hence He had the trait of mercy join and be placed first; such that what one benefits in this world is from the angle of kindness and a gift, rather than the receipt of a reward. And it is an obvious thing that He was also able to create the world with thought (as opposed to speech), as it is written (Exodus 15:6), “Your right hand, O Lord, is grand in power” – as was written by the Binah LeIttim: “And He did not need speech, except that it went up in His will to create [the world] with the attribute of mercy and to plough over the trait of strict justice. And it is as it was written by Binah LeIttim, regarding the matter of the “strong hand” that is mentioned about Egypt. And that is what he wrote: “I said that which I need speech in creating the world is because ‘the world is built upon kindness.’” And that is the meaning of that which is written (in the prayer book), “Blessed is the One who spoke and created the world.” And therefore there was a need for speech in each and every creation.   
And that is the meaning of that which is written, “With ten utterances the world was created.” And it is about this that [its author] was asking, “Nevertheless, what do we learn from this”; and also, “Nevertheless He did not need ten utterances; could He not have prepared the world with one utterance and that would have been enough?” And he answered about the first question, that it was so the evildoers know to what extent the evil of their deeds extends – that they are turning the trait of mercy into the trait of strict judgement; even though each and every creature was created with the trait of mercy, nevertheless, everything will be destroyed. And he answered about the second question, that He magnified His kindnesses in this world in order that everything that is given to the righteous in this world be all from the angle of kindness; but the reward of the [fulfillment of the] commandments be saved in its entirety for the world to come according to the attribute of strict justice, and it not be ‘bread of embarrassment.’ And this is the meaning of that which is written, “to give a goodly reward to the righteous” – it is exact; [it is goodly, in that it is] without bread of affliction. 
And with this we can understand [the Gemara’s statement] (Rosh Hashanah 32a), “’In the beginning’ is also considered an utterance, as it is stated (Psalms 33:6), ‘By the word of the Lord the heavens were made’” – and see Rashi’s commentary. For the holy Torah also caused and assisted the Creation, that it be able to exist – and as it is written (Kiddushin 30b), “I created the evil impulse, [and] I created the Torah as a remedy.” And this is the intent of the midrash at the beginning: That because the Holy One, blessed be He, only started using the expression, “And He said,” with, “Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3); but, “And He said” is not said regarding the creation of the heavens and the earth – therefore [we derive that] the heavens and the earth exist on account of the Torah, and did not need an utterance [other than the Torah itself]. And that is why the Torah weakens the strength of the evil impulse. Hence the fools will understand the Torah’s uniqueness, “and they will they will begin with words of Torah.” And this is the meaning of that which is written (Jeremiah 33:20), “Were it not for My covenant […], I would not have made the laws of heaven and earth.” For the heavens and the earth were created by way of the Torah.
From this they will see the greatness of the status of Torah and the obligation of Torah study – especially to raise one’s children with Torah and the fear [of God]: That they should begin with words of Torah; and not like those that make the languages of the nations and their wisdom, the main study for their children, and do not make the Torah – that our ancestors bequeathed to us – even an auxiliary [subject of study]. ‘They have forsaken living waters, to hew out broken wells.’ And even if it is necessary to learn the language of the nations among whom we live – as the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 29a), “A man is obligated to teach his son a trade” – that being said, they should not leave what is central, studying Torah, Gemara and the decisors [of Jewish law]. For this is our life. And all the more so should we not employ teachers called, “<i>lehrer</i>,” that do not have fear of God; and many of them are ‘rebellious Jews [who have sinned] with their bodies’ (in Rosh Hashanah 17a, this term is explained as referring to Jewish men who do not put on tefillin) – and the Torah that they teach certainly has no sign of blessing. Just the opposite, when the children and the infants of the schoolroom see their teachers sinning openly and privately, they will learn this from then – on account of our great sins. And they will stupefy the hearts of the children and also contaminate the house and the members of the household of those who employ them, as is well-known. For there have been many proper Jewish homes that – when these evildoers began to be employed there – ‘it appeared like a blemish in the house.’ So much so, that in the end, they would eat [non-kosher] meat and pork, and the father of the children would become a heretic because of them. 
And it is possible that it is about this that it was stated (Malachi 3:24), “And He shall bring back the hearts of the fathers for the children” – the explanation is that God, may He be blessed, will bring back the hearts of the fathers from the sins that they did through their children. As they employed a <i>lehrer</i>, until they too veered from the path of the Lord. Alternatively perhaps it is that the fathers have to repent for the children, in that they did not guide their children in the path of fear [of God] and Torah. And there is truly no way back for a man that does not possess Torah knowledge and does not support those who study the Torah, for he cannot overpower his evil impulse.” And this is as it is written, “I created the evil impulse, [and] I created the Torah as a remedy.”
And behold the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 5a), “If this wretched one, (the evil inclination), encounters you, pull it into the study hall. If it leaves, excellent; if not, he should recite Shema. If it leaves, excellent; if not, he should remind himself of the day of death.” And they attached it upon that which is written (Psalms 4:5), “Tremble, and sin no more, etc.” And the question [about this] is already well known: Why should one occupy himself with Torah and recite Shema, when there is a doubt if that will be effective? Let him immediately remind himself of the day of death, which is something easy and certainly effective! But, in fact, it is not a question at all, as all of [these steps] are necessary. For reminding himself of the day of death without Torah does not help at all. Just the opposite – it is written (Psalms 73:4), “For there are no pangs at their death; their body is firm.” And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Shabbat 31b), “They know that they will die, and their hearts are as unyielding for them as a hall [is wide].” As it is understood that it is just the opposite – since they know they will die, their hearts are firm to fulfill all of their desires. For they will say, “Eat and drink while we have the power, for tomorrow we will die; and there are neither actions nor accounting after death. So therefore now is the time to eat and drink and to do all of the abominations.” And if that is so, it is certain that reminding himself of death will not save him from sin. Rather it will only do so after he has studied Torah. And through that, he will come to the level that he can recite the Shema – meaning that he will accept the sacrifice of his life for the commandments of God. And, then, reminding himself of the day of death will certainly be effective to save him from sin. 
And I have said that there is a hint to this in that which is written (Deuteronomy 1:1), “These are the words that Moses addressed to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan – through the desert, in the Aravah facing Suf.” The understanding is that at first he must study Torah, which is called a desert, as it is written (Numbers 21:18), “from the desert (homiletically interpreted as a reference to Torah) to Matanah”. And afterwards, he should recite Shema, as it is written (Mishnah Berakhot 1:1), “From when do we recite Shema at night (<i>arvit</i>)?” And then it will be effective to remind himself and face the end (<i>sof</i>), meaning the end of a person. And that is the meaning of that which is written (Avot 4:22), “And do not let your [evil] impulse assure you that (thought he conjunction can also mean, since) the netherworld is a refuge for you.” The understanding is that you should not let it reassure you that you will be saved on the day of judgement, because you [will claim that you] were not able to subdue your evil impulse, as it is stated (Psalms 37:32), “The evildoer (here understood as the evil impulse, see Kiddushin 30b) watches for the righteous.” About this, it said to him, “Was not the netherworld – meaning death – a refuge for you?” As by reminding yourself of the day of death, you are able to be saved from the evil impulse. However it is certainly not effective without Torah [study first]. And I have been lengthy in this [discussion].
So let us come back to the first matter. Regarding that which I wrote above, we should look at the words of the Midrash (Kohelet Rabbah on Ecclesiastes 12:10): “’Kohelet sought to find a desirable thing’ – he sought to understand the giving of reward for the righteous in the future to come. [God] said to him, ‘I have already had it written (Psalms 31:20) – “How abundant is the good that You have in store for those who fear You”; and I say (Malachi 3:12), “for you shall be a land of desire.”’” And we may be exacting – what did Shlomo (Kohelet) find difficult? And also, what is the meaning of, “and I say?” And it appears that Shlomo is coming to teach two things. The first is that which I wrote above – that even in the world to come there is nothing coming to him according to strict justice, because of ‘who has a claim on Me from before, that I should repay him?’ And how does creation of the world help? And about this, He answered him with the answer mentioned above, and we can find it in the verse, “How abundant is the good” – that the abundant good of the world to come is saved, such that one does not benefit from the reward of the commandments in this world. And [the kindness] which ‘You have already done’ in this world “for those who take refuge in You” – meaning for the righteous – is from the angle of kindness, because they took refuge in You. And it is like the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said, “Everything that Israel benefits from in this world is for the sake of faith and is for [its impact on other] people. For if they, God forbid, saw that there was no good [coming] to the righteous in this world, it would be a desecration of [God’s] name that it would be ‘the same for the righteous and the evil’ – and they would not distinguish that the reward for the commandments is all stored for the world to come. However it can still be asked, “Behold the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 30a), ‘Were it not that the Holy One, blessed be He, helps him, he could not [overcome] it’ – if so, how can he claim reward in the next world, according to strict justice? Behold everything was from God’s help, may He be blessed, and not from his own actions! Rather it appears that it is certainly because the will is the main thing; and the desire to do the commandments is exclusively from the person. And hence they said (Berakhot 33b), “Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven” – for that is something that is dependent upon the heart. It is only if a person wants to do a commandment but is unable to go through with it in practice – because the evil impulse is standing in his way to make him stumble – that the Holy One, blessed be He, helps him. And that is the meaning of that which is written, “for you shall be a land of desire” – for desire and will is yours alone, so you will receive a full reward for your desire.
<b>The Gates of Zion</b><br><b>“And brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that would be its name” (Genesis 2:19):</b> This verse is very difficult to understand. For what reason is there for this calling; especially according to that which they said in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 17:4) that the Holy One, blessed be He, exalted Himself over the angels about that which they could not call the animals, names. It is difficult – what wisdom is there in this? And also that which He said, “I am the Lord, since that is the name that the first man (Adam) called me.” And also Rashi had to stretch a great deal to explain the end of the verse. But we shall not be lengthy about the nuances.
And what appears to me is as follows: The Sages, may their memory be blessed, said in Tractate Chullin (Chullin 91b), “Israel is more beloved than the ministering angels. As they only mention the name of God after three words, but the Jewish people mention [it] after two words.” But this needs explanation – for what is the reason for these three words; and what is [the Jewish people’s greater] importance? Also, behold Israel mentions [the name] even after one word, such as, “Praise to the Lord” (“to the Lord,” is one word in Hebrew). And sometimes we [even] begin with the name, such as with thirteen traits of mercy. And were it only that we would fulfill, “and he was afraid before My name” (Malachi 2:5) – these are the people that fear and tremble to mention the name of the Heavens with their mouths (see Berakhot 12a). For when one mentions the name of God, he needs to tremble. And also difficult is that which is said (in Chullin), “Behold there is [the case of the angels saying], ‘Blessed is the glory of (two words in Hebrew) Lord, etc.’” – and it was answered, “It is the <i>ofanim</i> (a higher category of angels) who say it.” And that is difficult. As there are in fact holy righteous ones that climb even beyond the <i>ofanim</i>, as we find with our teacher, Moshe, peace be upon him.   
And that which appears to me is from that which we say in the prayer of Rosh Hashanah, “And every created being will know, etc. and Your rulership is over all of the dominion (<i>mashalah</i>). And [the last word] is the initials of (Psalms 92:1), “A psalm – a song for the day of Shabbat (<i>Mizmor Shir Leyom HaShabbat).” And likewise is it said (in the Shabbat morning prayers}, “This is the song of praise of the Shabbat day… ‘It is good to praise the Lord (<i>Tov hehodot laShem)’ (Psalms 92:2)” – the explanation of the matter is that these three words are the three names [represented by], “He scatters frost like ashes (<i>kefor ke’effer yifazer</i>)” (Psalms 147:16, see Mekor Mayim Chayim on Baal Shem Tov, Vayigash 6:4): And that is that <i>tov</i> [has a numerical equivalent of] seventeen, which is the name of <i>aleph-hay-vay-hay], the initials of <i>et hashamyim ve’et haaretz</i> (the heavens and the earth), which indicates the past. And the [four-letter] name of the Lord indicates the present. And <i>hodu</i> [has a numerical equivalent of] twenty-one (the name, <i>aleph-hay-yod-hay), which indicates the future, as I have explained about the verse, “I will be what I will be” (Exodus 3:14). And this name indicates the ‘sweetening of harsh judgements’ at their root. And that is that when we observe all of the Creator’s oversight over all of His creatures; such that even if we do not feel the good now, nevertheless, good will come out of it in the future. And one who considers this will take good counsel from it, to accept everything with love – as he will not concentrate on the apparent bad, but rather on the good in the future. And through this, he will ‘bless the bad just like the good,’ and bring the thing back to its root. As above (in its roots), everything is good, such that the matter will automatically be sweetened. And understand this. For, in my humble opinion, this is the intention of Nachum, the man of Gimzo (Taanit 21a; see further, Parashat Tzav, p. 162.). And hence this name is composed of the letters, <i>hey-vav-dalet-vav</i>, an expression of raising, such as “his hand he shall place above (<i>hadah</i>)” (Isaiah 11:8); “voices raised joyfully (<i>hed</i>) on the hills.” For the matter must be raised to its root; and it will automatically be sweetened.</i></i></i></i>
Hence I derived pleasure when I was precise about the prayer (in the blessings before Shema), “To the blessed (<i>barukh</i>) God (understood by the author, as, To God; bless!) they give pleasant hymns, etc. for He alone does mighty deeds, etc., plants righteous acts, raises salvations, etc.” For, at first glance, there is no predicate (meaning, there is no indication of what God is being blessed for). And it appears to me that it can be explained based on the Gemara (Megillah 25a, and see there that the text is slightly different), “One said [in prayer], ‘The bold, The mighty, etc.’” And they rebuked him, “Have you concluded all of the praises of your Master?” “As it is stated (Psalms 106:2), ‘who can declare all of His praises’” (Megillah 18a). But, in fact, we say many praises. For the verses of song (<i>pesukei dezimrah</i>) in the morning prayers are full of – and even all of the blessing of the shmoneh esreh (standing prayer) are all – praises. Rather the matter is that there are two types of praise. The first are essential praises, such as when we praise a man as a sage, or as learned, or as a scribe, wealthy or strong and that which is similar to this – such things only help himself. But the second type is when we praise a man for being generous, a doer of good deeds or as a kind soul and that which is similar to this – things that help others. So behold, concerning the first type, it is forbidden for us to greatly praise the Lord, may He be blessed, for the reason found in the Gemara above. However, we do praise God, may He be blessed, [without limit] for the good things that He does for us. And even though we do not sense everything – as we say, ‘and there are wonders without comparison’ (and see Ketuvot 8b), which are wondrous miracles that a person does not know about, and as it is said in the Gemara (Yoma 22b), “How little does a person sense or have concern for how much he has the support of his Lord” – nevertheless, we are obligated to thank God, may He be blessed, for all about which we are aware; to make known and reveal that we believe that everything is from Him. So we give Him praise and thanks for everything. And also with the songs and praises, we benefit and bring down flows [of blessing]. And that is the understanding of the word, blessed (<i>barukh</i> [above]. It is an expression of extending (<i>berakha</i>) and pulling down, etc. Hence [referring back to the prayer with which the paragraph begins,] “they extol” is sweetening; and “they blessed” is pulling down. And this is the understanding of all the blessings in the shmoneh eshreh – it is all to, accordingly, pull down [the flow] from the Source of the blessings. And we hence say, “Praised king,” an expression of praise and sweetening; “and extoled,” meaning unified; until always (<i>aad</i>), which is the transposed name of God (when each letter except aleph is replaced by the letter before it), the numerical equivalent of which is seventy four. When the name of God (understood to represent strict justice] is transposed, it is sweetened, as is written in the Shelah (Schnei Luchot HaBrit). And then, “His great name” is the filling out [of the four letter name] of seventy two, which is the numerical equivalent of kindness (<i>chessed</i>). We have merited all this – us, His treasured nation – for He oversees us with kindnesses, and strict judgements which are concealed kindnesses. And for all of this, we give Him praise and thanks. But about His essential characteristics, we are not allowed to expand upon His praises. 
And behold it is certain that the angels also do not have permission to expand upon his [essential] praises – since they too do not fathom Him. And so, according to my humble opinion, also that which the angels laud Him is regarding his goodnesses that He has flow upon us. And hence we can say [the meaning of the prayer is as follows]: “To God – bless, [meaning, as] the One who is pulling down His goodnesses upon His creations – they give pleasant hymns, etc.; for the reason that He plants righteous acts, creates healings, etc.” And because of this, their prosecution about not creating man is silenced. For if man was not created, with what would they praise Him? And it is about this that Israel is more important than the angels – since we praise the Holy One, blessed be He, about the kindnesses and the strict judgements. And it is as it is said (in the morning prayers), “We praise You Lord, our God (the two names representing kindness and judgement respectively), with praises and songs.”
And that is the explanation of, “Holy and blessed”: That He is holy over internality, in that the Holy One, blessed be He, conceals His being in the worlds; and it appears that He acts according to nature. And that is why the angels say, “holy,” three times – corresponding to the three worlds. And that is why it is written, “the Lord of hosts” – since He makes all the varieties in the world exist, the whole world below is full of His glory. But “blessed,” is the pulling down of the flow from the Source of blessings – to be revealed. And hence the Jew – whom the Holy One, blessed be He, oversees with both – may praise the Holy One, blessed be He, with both of them. And that is the meaning of the two words, “Hear Israel” – which is male and female, which are strict justice and mercy – “the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.” For the trait of strict justice and the trait of mercy are all one. And therefore we say afterwards, “And you shall love” – even if He takes your life (Mishnah Berakhot 9:5). But the Holy One, blessed be He, does not oversee the angels like this, so they are only permitted to praise what is given over [to them]. And hence this praise is divided into two: The angels praise Him with, “holy,” which is internality; whereas the <i>ofanim</i>, with, “blessed,” which is externality. But Israel has merited both of them, and say, “Holy and blessed.“
And I have already explained the verse, “There is none holy like the Lord, since there is none besides Him” (I Samuel 2:2) – see there. And there it is explained that every physical thing of this world has the four letter name of God sustaining it from nothingness to being, such that it not be nullified in existence – and that is through the holy letters of the four letter name of God and their substitutes. For example, the word, <i>even</i> (stone), has three letters which come out of the four letter name, by way of many substitutions and combinations. Hence it is very physical – as is written in the Tanya (Tanya, Part Two, The Gateway of Unity and Belief  1) about the verse, “Great, etc. and full of power” (Psalms 147:5) – see there. And there is hence also internality and externality in all things – meaning the internality is the letters that make and sustain them from nothingness to being; whereas the externality is that which is seen by the eyes. And that is an illustration of the “holy and blessed” that was referred to.  
And that was the matter of Adam’s calling the animals, names. As his vision was pure, so he saw the internality of [the animal] that was making it exist. And in this way, he called it a name. [And] therefore the angels could not call him a name; as they did not merit these two things of “holy and blessed” – which was not the case with [Adam], who was more elevated than them. And he therefore called them the names [that came from] the four letter name – as he saw that He, may He be blessed, was causing the existence of everything from nothingness to being. And if so, Adam did not invent anything with this. For the letters were already clothed in that thing; however the angels did not know about it, as only God knew it. And this is the meaning of that which is written, “and whatever the man called each living creature” – [living] because of the life force in it – “that would be its name,” in truth, since it was already its name, etc. Blessed be God forever and ever, Amen.
<b>Novel Understandings of Aggadah for Weddings or a <i>Channukat HaBayit</i> </b><br><b>“Male and female He created them; […] and He called them, Man (Adam)” (Genesis 5:2):</b> We must understand the matter of being called a name – of her first also being called Adam, but afterwards He called her “woman (<i>eeshah</i>), for from man (<i>eesh</i>),  was she taken” (Genesis 2:23); and afterwards [Adam] called her, Chava (Genesis 3:20). [This can be understood] according to that which is written (Deuteronomy 22:8), “When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof, etc.” For it must be understood why He mentioned specifically a new house, since this law applies even to an old house and in any situation in which one needs to remove a hazard from his home. And [we must] also [understand] that which is written, “if the faller should fall from it” – as Rashi had to stretch. And it appears to me [that it can be explained] according to that which was written in Noam Meggadim on the verse, “Wealth and riches are in his house [and his charity will last forever]” (Psalms 112:3), and by way of further explanation according to that which is written (Avot 4:1), “Who is wealthy? One who is happy with his portion.” I mean to say that the way of most people is to become sad about expenses and happy about that which remains to them. But it is just the opposite! For what remains to him is not his, as it was written about Moonbaz (Bava Batra 11a), “My ancestors stored up [money] in a place where the hand can reach (such that it is not assured).” But [as opposed to them,] he was happy with what he spent on charity and for good deeds, as this is truly one’s portion. And this is the meaning of that which is written, “Wealth and riches are in his house” – meaning to say, and he cannot be certain that there are his – however the charity that he has done is what will last him forever.
And behold anyone who is involved in building a house must be concerned with two evils. The first is that one who is involved in building may become poor; and as a result, he will be tight about household expenditures, that he should not also be tight with charity. The second is that his heart not become haughty from the building that he is building ‘with turrets’ – as is written in Noam Meggadim on the verse, “For the Lord delights in His people, etc.” (Psalms 149:4): That even at the time of salvation and much plenty, they are still lowly. This is as it is written (Deuteronomy 7:7), “It is not because you are the most numerous” – [but rather because] you make yourselves small. And that is the meaning of, “When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof.” It teaches about haughtiness – that one should not raise his heart (but put a limit on it). That is one point. The other is that “you shall not place blood (<i>damim</i>, which can also mean money, though that is clearly not the plain meaning of the verse here) in your house: When they ask money from you for charity, do not say, “I have spent the money that I had to build the house. And the reason for the matter is, “for the faller should fall, etc.” – and a poor person is called a faller, as there is no one to hold his hand. 
And in a different way, [we can explain it] according to that which is written (Bava Batra 98a), “One who is haughty is not accepted even by the members of his household.” And Rashi explains, “The members of his household, [means] his wife.” And the reason for the thing is that the Divine Presence dwells between a man and his wife, as is well known. But anyone who is haughty pushes away the feet of the Divine Presence, so he does not have a harmonious domestic life. Rather there is a voice of claims, strife and dissension between them. And that is the meaning of that which is written, “When you build a new house” – his house is his wife (Yoma 2a) – then “you shall make a parapet for your roof,” [understood] as mentioned above, that he should not become haughty. For otherwise, “you shall not place <i>damim</i> in your house” – which is an expression of quiet – there will [instead] be yelling, strife and disagreement. And so Adam first called her, Adam, as they were perfectly united – before being split. But when she was separated from him, he called her, woman – since God was still dwelling between them. But then after the sin, when there was no longer peace between them, he called her, Chava – which is an expression of speech, as in, “expresses (<i>yechaveh</i>) knowledge” (Psalms 19:3). And this is as it is written in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 18:4), “’This time (<i>paam</i>)’ (Genesis 2:23), as it says (Exodus 28:34), ‘A golden bell (<i>paamon</i>),’ etc. – that will yell out in the future, etc.” And this is especially with a second marriage, which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Sotah 2a) is [determined] according to his actions. And that is because it is impossible for a first marriage to be according to his actions – for what he will be like is not known before conception (which is when the match is determined). As [while many things are determined before conception,] whether he will be righteous or an evildoer is not (Niddah 16b). But with the second marriage, he is matched according to his deeds. And hence he must improve all of his traits for the sake of Heaven, so that his match will go well.
<b>From the Pesach Haggadah:</b> “And God saw all that He had made and behold, it was very good” (Genesis 1:31): As on each day, it is stated, “And God saw that it was good” – that from God, may He blessed, seeing it, it was good. But afterwards (on the sixty day), God saw again (a second time) – and that was very good.

The Israelites shall camp each with his standard, under the banners of their ancestral house; (Bamidbar 2:2) May we shout for joy in your victory, arrayed by flags in the name of our Gd. (Tehillim 20:6) The Explanation of that verse is someone who hasn’t got up to this attribute; several days and weeks have passed and during the days of the Sefira, they have not managed to improve anything.  How can they ascent the Mountain of Gd on the holy festival? However when you unite with your creator and you don’t do something for your own sake it is possible to skip ledaleg  that is why it says (Shir Hashirim 2:4) his flag of love was over me  Do not read it as their ‘flag’ diglo rather their ‘skipping’ dilugo; When this person serves with love it is possible to jump to the highest level even though it is not following the usual order…
Since we are doing it not for our own sake but for our Gd – then we are able to skip to the highest level

And behold, the ese three characteristics, that are bashful, merciful, and performers of kindness - we find their opposites in thise who are divided from the community of Israel. For the attribute of kindness is nonexistent in all other nations, as it is written "chesed to the nations is a sin" (Mishlei 14:34). And the attribute of mercifulness is not in the Giv'onim, who are the Netinim, who did not have mercy on the sons of Sha'ul. And the attribute of bashfulness is not found in mamzerim, as it is written "and a harlot's forehead" (Yirmiyahu 3:3). And it also says, "any arrogant priest is from these" [servants who assimilated into the priesthood] (Kiddushin 70b).

<b><i>Like a nation that does righteousness, etc.</i></b> The explanation is that which it is stated, <i>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and those that return to her with righteousness</i> (Isaiah 1:27). As it is on account of these two, namely judgment and righteousness, that the redemption is hastened. But there is a need to understand the reason for the thing. And it appears to me that when we want to fix some corruption, there is a need to see its basis. So behold, the Temple was destroyed on account of jealousy [and] hatred. Hence if we want to hasten the redemption and bring back the [Godly] flow to the Jewish people, there is a need to pursue peace and to be forbearing with one's traits. And these two traits, namely judgment and righteousness, are a charm for peace, as it is written: <i>And the work of righteousness shall be peace</i> (Isaiah 32:18); <i>the judgment of truth and peace</i> (Zechariah 8:16). And hence it stated here that they are complaining about My traits and want to know My ways as if they were supporting judgment and righteousness. So they therefore say, <i>Why, when we fasted, did You not see, etc.</i> (Isaiah 58:3). But He answered to this, <i>Because you fast in strife and contention, etc.</i> (Isaiah 58:4). And that is that which is written, <i>they ask of Me judgments of justice; they desire that God should be near</i> (Isaiah 58:2). For it is just the opposite — they apply the laws upon themselves and mention their sin in searching, as per the below, and I have written ethical teachings and rebukes about this at length. But the Lord does not desire burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as obedience to His voice [alluding to I Samuel 15:22]. So what will words of fasting and the recital of Psalms help when he lays an ambush for [his fellow] inside himself [alluding to Jeremiah 9:7]? And one should truly not likewise blame the rest of the uneducated people, since they follow their leaders who do not speak peacefully among themselves. And it is because of these individuals that they do not have the yoke of Torah and judgment upon them.
