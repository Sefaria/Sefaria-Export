Bnei Yissaschar

Introduction

The children of Issachar are those who possess  understanding to discern the times and know  what Israel should do (1 Chronicles 12:32). They were consecrated for specific times (Berakhot 49a), and they serve as vessels to receive their sanctity. Therefore, their souls are keenly aware of the changing times for the better, and their souls are filled with pleasant and harmonious bonds that flow with the abundance of holiness according to the beloved and pleasant order of times.
They are the ones who receive the abundant gifts that the Holy One, blessed be He, bestows upon the souls of Israel, and they utilize them to do good for others. The humble will rejoice in the Lord and the poor among mankind will exult in the Holy One of Israel (Isaiah 29:19). It is the joy of the soul that delights in the sanctity of the "hidden light" that envelops the heads of the children of Israel, each according to their own preparation. It becomes sanctified, transcending its impurities from daily mundane sins, resembling the pattern of the World to Come, where each individual is rewarded according to their own preparation, as our Sages of blessed memory said, "Every righteous person is handsome in the imprint of their friend's chuppah."
Likewise, wisdom grants strength to the wise through the sanctity of time, according to their place and the hour that flows to them from the supernal holiness. Even though the entire congregation, including the Holy One, blessed be He, is holy, there is still no comparison or value in the equality of all souls in receiving. Therefore, our Sages of blessed memory said (and they learned it from Scripture): "A person is obligated to receive the countenance of their teacher as a face-to-face encounter." For the sublime holiness that flows from the sanctity in time, the value of the teacher is not comparable to that of the student. Through receiving the countenance of their teacher, they become individuals whose faces are turned toward each other, influencing and receiving, becoming one flesh, like lighting one candle from another.
And behold, the supernal sanctity that flows into the soul according to the times of the season is perceived through the letters of the Torah. For indeed, the soul itself is spiritual letters. Therefore, it is the custom of our ancestors to gather as a unique congregation during sacred times to receive the countenance of their teacher. This custom entails the teacher sharing words of Torah with them so that through the letters of the Torah, the abundance of the supernal holiness that flows into the teacher is transmitted to the congregants, and they, in turn, will receive from it as a flock of holy sheep.
And these letters will serve as conduits through which the flow of holiness will be drawn. Consequently, the words of Torah that the holy teacher imparts to their disciples correspond to the sanctity of the time and the unique preparation of the soul. This time is not comparable to another time, and no soul is similar to its companion.
And behold, the soul that delights in the holiness of the letters of the Torah, which flow to it from the higher realms through the sanctification of time, even on weekdays, it will have assistance, support, and benefit to walk in the path of Torah and fear of Heaven. This is similar to what is said in the holy Zohar regarding the interaction between a teacher and a student: "Whoever gazes upon that word that his teacher says to him, his teacher and so on." From this, one can understand that the student constantly contemplates every matter from the words of Torah received from their teacher. Wisdom is called "holiness," as you have said (Psalms 20:3), "He will send you help from the sanctuary." With each instance, an additional level of wisdom is given to delve into one matter from within another matter.
Similarly, the individual themselves, when they constantly contemplate those words of Torah that flow to them from the holiness during the sanctification of time, will also gain additional heightened wisdom on weekdays, which hints at holiness. Therefore, I have written this as a reminder for myself and for my children, all the things that have arisen in our memory regarding what the Almighty has prepared for us during sacred times.
May our words be pleasing before the Lord, and may we merit complete redemption swiftly in our days, and may the Lord rejoice in His deeds.

<b>Why this Sabbath is called "Shabbat HaGadol" ("The Great Sabbath")</b> <br>We must still explain why we call this Sabbath "Shabbat HaGadol," the Great Sabbath. It is based on our interpretation of the verse, "Great are the works of the Lord; they are pondered by all who delight in them." (Psalm 111:2) As is known, the end of this verse does not seem to fit with its beginning, and it is unclear. We explained this matter based on the words of the Sages (Chazal). In Jewish Law, there are two categories: action and thought. An adult, even if he only thought about making something into a vessel, that item is considered a vessel for the purposes of ritual purity and impurity. However, a minor can only act; they do not have the capacity for the kind of thought that creates a vessel in a ritual sense. <br>We know that for the Jewish people, God considers a good intention as an action, as the Sages taught, "For those who fear the Lord and for those who hate His Name, even if a person only thought about performing a commandment..." (Kiddushin 40a) This is not the case with non-Jews. It is fitting to provide a reason for this difference. <br>Does it really matter to me if a non-Jew's thoughts are considered an action? It would be fitting if this were so (and we have already provided various reasons for this). But this concept originates from the time when God, blessed be His Name, desired to create the world. The Jewish people were present in God's thoughts. "In the beginning, God created the world" (Genesis 1:1) for the sake of the Jewish people, who are called "the first" (Reshit). At that point, the Jewish people had not yet performed any actions. Nevertheless, their presence in God's thoughts was sufficient. Their existence in thought was equivalent to action. <br>Therefore, Jewish Law states that for the Jewish people, a good thought is considered an action, which is not true for the other nations of the world. <br>The creation of the world described in the Torah began on the evening preceding the first day, "And there was evening, and there was morning, one day" (Genesis 1:5). Since the Jewish people existed in God's thoughts before the creation of time, that time – the Sabbath that preceded the creation of time – is called the "time of the afternoon prayer of the Sabbath," the "time of desire." Since God, blessed be His Name, desired to create the world on that Sabbath, that Sabbath is called "the day of knowledge," as the verse states, "To know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you" (Exodus 31:13). This is the meaning of the Sages' statement, "A good gift...and the Sabbath is its name for you. And He informed them, as it is said, 'To know..." (Shabbat 10b). <br>When the Jewish people left Egypt, God wanted to give them the wondrous quality that they possess more than any other nation: that their thoughts about performing commandments are considered equivalent to actually performing them. God commanded them to perform the first commandment, the offering of the Passover sacrifice. He commanded them to take the lamb on the tenth of the month (which is different from the Passover in later generations), which was then a Sabbath, to show them that the thoughts they have about performing the commandments, such as the slaughtering of the Passover lamb, are considered to be the commandment itself (which is not the case for the other nations of the world). The reason for this is the Sabbath, the time when the Jewish people existed in God's thoughts. <br>This understanding allows us to interpret the verse, "Great are the works of the Lord; they are pondered by all who delight in them." (Psalm 111:2) Actions done for the sake of God, blessed be He, are called "great," for "He will surely be gracious to the good, even the desire and the thought that a person has to do the deeds of the commandments for the sake of God." Thus they are called "great," like an adult who can create a vessel merely through thought. Because this concept was revealed to the Jewish people on this Sabbath, it is called "Shabbat HaGadol," the Great Sabbath, in remembrance of the fact that we have been given the laws and status of an adult, who can create a vessel merely through thought.

<b>A Tour in the Orchard<br>Sermons found in my writings that I presented on Shabbat HaGadol [the Shabbat preceding Pesach], according to the the ways of the orchard [<i>pardes</i>, which is made of letters that form an acrostic for the four levels of interpretation — the simple, the hermeneutic, the hinted and the esoteric]. That is why I have called it A Tour in the Orchard. The first sermon is one I presented still in the days of my youth:<br>Shmuel said,</b> "<i>The bread of affliction [lechem oni]</i> (Deuteronomy 16:3), [bread over] which one answers [<i>onim</i>] matters." It was likewise taught [in a baraita], "<i>Lechem oni</i> is bread over which one answers many matters. Alternatively, <i>leḥem oni</i> is written [in such a way as to spell out], <i>ani</i> [a poor person]. Just as it is the manner of a poor person to eat a piece of bread [and not a loaf], so too, here [he should use] a piece. Alternatively, just as the manner of a poor person is that he heats the oven and his wife bakes [quickly], so too here; he heats the oven and his wife bakes." (Pesachim 116a-b) Behold that Tur, Shulchan Arukh, and all the later authorities decided like all of these variations. That means, like Shmuel and all of the first teaching in the baraita — that we answer matters over it, which is why they determined that there is a need to bring back the [seder] plate with the matzah when we recite the Haggadah — and all of the later teaching, specifically [to use] a piece for the eating of the matzah that is commanded. But we should wonder about Rambam, who wrote explicitly that it is not necessary to bring back the plate until he says, "this matzah" [after the main discussion in the Haggadah]. It follows that he holds that reciting the Haggadah need not be over the matzah. If follows [further] that he does not reason like Shmuel and the first variation in the baraita. So he holds that the central variation is the later one, the precise inference that it is written [in such a way as to spell out], the bread of a poor person: Just as it is the manner of a poor person to eat a piece of bread, etc. Accordingly, he brings this teaching from the verse about the law of [eating] a piece. But behold, on account of what did he push off the words of Shmuel, and especially since Rabbi Akiva, in the chapter [entitled] Kol Sha'ah, has the same position? And likewise, the baraita here in the first variation. And behold I saw that [the author of] Beit Chadash, may his memory be blessed, wrote in Section 473 [on Tur, Orach Chaim 473], that Rambam holds that that which Shmuel said, and also in the baraita, that we answer, etc. is not exact. It is that [the discussion] should be at the time of the engagement with the eating of matzah. That means, on this night, that is when we are answering and recounting the matter of the exodus. But these words are not understood by me, the small one. As if you are to think that Rambam held like this, Rambam should have hence brought this verse as a proof, <i>the bread of affliction</i>, over which one answers, etc., like he brought this verse as a proof for the law of the piece. And even if we say that that which Shmuel said that we answer over it is not exact, but rather to make us understand that it is necessary to recite the Haggadah on the night of eating matzah; behold we do not need to learn that from <i>the bread of affliction</i>! They brought a complete verse in a braita in the Haggadah, "In order that you will remember, etc. <i>For the sake of this</i> (Exodus 13:8). I didn't say 'for the sake of this,' except [that it be observed] when [this] matzah and bitter herbs are resting, etc. [meaning, on the night of the fifteenth]." Hence we need to say that Shumuel meant exactly over [the matzah] and came to teach us this novelty that the Haggadah must be exactly over it. That is, the matzah should be visible, close to him, at the time of reciting the Haggadah. So the question on the Rambam returns: Why did he not decide this way, and just the opposite, decide that there is no need to bring back the plate?

Blessed is the Holy One, Blessed is the One who gave us Torah. One should ponder on the relevance here of giving the Torah. It appears to me, however, that the letters of the Torah were also in exile in Egypt. And it was on account of the iron furnace that the exiles were able to leave their exile and come to the time of the giving of the Torah. This is what is meant by (Exodus 3:12) "And this shall be the sign (<i>ot</i>)" - meaning the letters (<i>otiot</i>) of the Torah. Now the 27 letters of the Torah are pure, (<i>zach</i>), and each of them consists of all of them. 27 multiplied by 27 is equal to "Pesach, Matzah and Maror." Therefore these are the three things that Rabban Gamliel obligated us to declare on Pesach, in order to show the greatness of using the mouth to express the letters of the Torah which we are commanded to speak.

And now, blessed are you by God, oh sweet reader. Be enlightened and understand that on this day began the revelation of the goodness of the Torah within which was hidden “the light that was good,” that light which allowed Adam to see from one end of the world to the other, and through which we can see the mysteries of the Creator. R’ Shimon bar Yochai was called “the holy lamp” because through him were revealed the secrets of Torah, that is the secret of “the light that was good” which is hidden in the Torah. Therefore his holy book is called the Zohar (lit. brilliance), meaning a light which shines from one end of the world to the other – the ‘good light’ which  is hidden away in the Torah. That is why this day is the best of days for the giving of Torah. This is when the good light in the Torah began to shone forth, as we have learned. And this day is the 33rd day of the Omer, Lag Baomer. This is the day of the hilulah (lit. rejoicing) of R’ Shimon bar Yochai, the very day on which he ascended to the highest heavens. It also makes sense to assume that he was born on this day as well, because the Holy One sits and completes the years of the righteous from day to day (Kiddushin 38a). The very day on which ‘the light that is good’ began to shine out from the Torah, that is the best of days before the giving of the Torah, is the very day on which the holy soul that would reveal the path of ‘the light that is good’ in Torah was itself revealed. That is why this holy soul was called “the holy lamp,” on the very day that he rose up to the highest heavens he commanded R’ Aba to write down all the storehouses of hidden knowledge which he had revealed in order to leave behind a blessing from the illumination of the hidden light (that is good, as it says “How abundant is the good that You have in store for those who fear You…” (Psalms 31:20)) It is preserved there for us and our children until the light of our righteous Messiah is revealed, speedily and in our day! It is as our Sages said “And God said, let there be light…” this refers to the light of the King Messiah (Pesikta Rabbati 36), in the merit of our occupation with ‘the light that is good’ which the holy lamp left behind as a blessing and life, and a light for all Israel.

One particular custom practiced on the day of Lag B'Omer is unique: Children go to parks and fields to play with bows and arrows. What is the reason for this peculiar custom? One well-known explanation[5] has to do with the fact that during Rabbi Shimon's lifetime, no rainbow ever appeared in the sky[6]. This is profoundly significant, because Genesis relates[7] that the rainbow represented G-d's covenant never to destroy the world again even if the human race would degenerate to its status prior to the Flood. But as long as Rabbi Shimon was alive, his merit and piety alone were enough to ensure that G-d would not regret His creation, with no need for the rainbow. On the day of Rabbi Shimon's passing, however, the world was in need of the rainbow. Thus, each year on that day we recall this man's greatness by playing with the bow[8].

...Notice how our teachers say, “Forty days before an embryo is formed a Divine Voice announces in the heavens: The daughter of so-and-so is destined to marry so-and-so” (See Sotah 2a, above). Forty days before the 25th of Elul is the time before us of Tu b'Av. [At this time] Israel arise in thought to be wedded to the most honored Sovereign.

And so it is with Tu b'Shvat which is celebrated as a festival. It is the new year for the trees, and notice how it is also forty days before the 25th of Adar, as hinted by the verse, “For the person is a tree of the field” (Deut. 20:19).

R' Eliezer holds that the universe was created in Tishrei and R' Yehoshua holds in Nisan.
And they're both true according to our master the Arizal, this one in action and this one in thought.

<b>Regarding</b> the dreams that Yosef dreamt, it is written, "He had another dream, etc. and behold, the sun, the moon, etc. He told it to his father and to his brothers, etc." Behold, in its stating, "another dream," the word, "another," is extra. And did we not know that it was another one? And it also fitting to contemplate why he told the first dream only to his brothers, but the second dream was also told to his father. And it appears that it can be explained that this dream was [truly] another, and not related to the content of the first. As the interpretation of the first one was that he would be appointed as ruler and governor in Egypt and that his brothers would come and bow down to him. And that was on account of the grain, since they came to buy grain from Egypt. Hence the dream was with the sheaves of the grain fields. And only his brothers bowed down to him then. Whereas the second dream was a different dream; that dream was with the heavenly retinue, the sun and the moon - when the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, the intention being to the future, may it come speedily in our days! Behold in his month, that is the month associated with his son, Menashe - being the month of MarCheshvan - in which the Temple will be dedicated in the future, all flesh will then come to bow down before the Lord on the holy mountain. And Yaakov, Rachel and the tribes of Yeshurun will also come to bow down. And this is [the meaning of[ of that which is written, "bow down to me": Meaning, in the month attributed to me, to my son, Menashe. And behold that is a different dream. Therefore he told this dream to his father as well, since the Third Temple corresponds to Yaakov, who called it a House. But behold, to dispel it from the hearts of his brothers, Yaakov said in wonder, "Are we to come, etc. to bow down to you?" For the intention is not only about your month. Therefore, "his father guarded the thing." For he was discerning about the thing.

The miracle of the light of the Menorah during this month is derived from the hidden light that was concealed within the Torah. And see what is written [further on] in the name of the Rokeach (Rokeach HaGadol 225) that for this reason they instituted [a total of] thirty-six candles, to parallel the thirty-six times that “light” “candle” and “luminaries” are mentioned in the Torah, which hints to the hidden light that shined for Adam HaRishon for thirty-six hours but was then hidden away and concealed within the Torah. And in my opinion, this is the reason that the name of this month (in which there is an illumination from the light hidden and concealed within the Torah) is “Kislev” - ki”s le”v - a covering [kisui] for the thirty-six [l”v] appearances of “light”, “candle” and “luminaries” of which an illumination is revealed during this month. And attached to this light is Tevet, “the light was good.”

2. For this reason these days are called Chanukah, from the word chinuch [preparatory training] and practice for what is to come, for the future redemption. For then, the hidden light will be revealed to us in its fullness, as the Sages taught that “God hid it away for the righteous in the future”, as it says, “the sun will no longer be your light in the day, nor will the glow of the moon be a light for you. But God will be an eternal light for you” (Isaiah 60:19). And this will be at the end of this exile that began with the fourth Kingdom. But even before the end of the third Kingdom, the Kingdom of Greece, the Blessed God shined a small bit of that light for us, even after prophecy had ceased, so that the light can remain with us in this current exile in place of prophecy. For through this light a person can gaze from one end of the universe to the other. And it is therefore called the Chanukah candle, the candle of chinuch [preparatory training] and practice for the eternal light of the future redemption, when that hidden light - about which it was said “let there be light” - will be revealed.

This discourse will discuss the reasons why the miracle was performed through oil. The discourse is called "Oil for Lighting": The reason why Hashem performed the miracle through oil is because the Greeks wanted to abolish the wisdom of the Torah and increase foreign wisdom, Greek philosophy. At the time of salvation, “The Jews had light” (Ester 8:16) - this refers to the Torah (Megillah 16b). Hashem performed the miracle through oil which is alluded to the wisdom of Torah, as Chazal say (Menachot 85b): “Yoav sent (a messenger) to Tekoa to bring a wise  woman from there” (Shmuel II 14:2). He sent specifically to Tekoa because the oil in Tekoa was second to none, and wherever olive oil is found, wisdom is found. (As I mentioned above several times).

In Sefer Yetzirah (5:10) it is written:
“He made the letter Tzadik king over taste
And He bound a crown to it...
And with them He formed Aquarius in the Universe
Shevat in the Year
And the Korkeban in the Soul
Male and female.”
The early commentators taught that the constellation of the Bucket (Aquarius) is the constellation of Israel. And even though we have learned, “there is no constellation for Israel,” meaning Israel overturn the judgement of the constellation through their actions and Torah learning, nonetheless they do have a constellation concerning their time of birth (See Shabbat 156a).
And one could say that the bucket is the constellation of Israel because the bucket is made to draw water, and this is its function.
See, it handles and serves with the water.
And “there is no water but Torah” (Bava Kamma 17a), as it is written: “Ho, all who are thirsty, Come for water” (Is. 55:1). This teaches that the constellation of Israel is a servant handling and serving with the Torah.
And even if the judgement of the constellation obligates [i.e. burdens] one in a certain [negative] way, through engaging with Torah and mitzvot, everything is turned to good. And the constellation will incline towards everything they want, for their constellation is a servant serving the Torah.
And you will understand through this what our Sages taught about the faithful servant of Abraham, our father, that he was the very first of those connected to us, and the blessed Holy One raised him higher than the constellations (see Gen. 15:5 with Rashi). The verse “his servant, the elder of his household” (Gen. 24:2), they explain with, “he one in charge of my household is Dammesek Eliezer!” (Gen. 15:2), meaning that he draws [doleh] and gives drink [mashke] to others from his master’s Torah (Yoma 28b).
And this is alluded by [the name of Abraham's] servant to teach the above, that the bucket is the constellation of Israel, for the bucket is a servant, serving the water, which is Torah.
And the servant has no will of their own, rather only the will of their master, as the pious one wrote in Obligations of the Heart (Gate of Divine Service, ch. 4-5). And understand this matter.

According to the order of their banners [in the wilderness], this month relates to the Tribe of Asher, about whom it is written: “Asher’s bread will be rich, [And he will produce delicacies fit for royalty]” (Gen. 49:20); and also, “May he dip his foot in oil” (Deut. 33:24), because there was much olive oil in his portion [of the land], and every place where olive oil is found, there Wisdom is found. 
As it says, “And Joab sent to Tekoa [Tekoa produces fine olive oil] and brought a wise woman from there,” (II Samuel 14:2 with Menachot 85b). Because the constellation of this month is the Bucket (Aquarius) the constellation of Israel, the servant who serves with water, which is Torah, the essence of Wisdom:
 “Torah emerges from Wisdom” (Zohar 2:121a).
“In the beginning” (Gen. 1:1) is translated [by the Jerusalem Targum] as “With Wisdom” meaning “With the Torah” (See Genesis Rabbah 1:1). Therefore this month is connected to the tribe of Asher, whose portion contains olive oil, which cultivates Wisdom.

Rosh Hashanah for the 'tree',  not for the 'trees,' unlike the others in the mishnah (which are plural). This hints at that which we have received from our rabbis - that on Tu B'Shevat one should pray for God to provide them with a beautiful, perfect, kosher etrog at the time it is needed for the mitzva. This is the day when the sap rises in the trees according to the merits of each member of Israel, and how good and pleasant it is that one pray on this day, the foundational moment of new growth, for God to provide for them in the right time the 'fruit of the hadar tree.' (Lev. 23:40) Behold, their prayers will bear fruit! This is what the Tanna hinted at when he used the singular 'tree,' in order to indicate the specific tree which the Torah clearly intends for fulfilling a commandment.

Consider and reflect the teachings on Sivan (1:6 and 1:7) about the would-be convert who approached Shammai (Shabbat 31a), who embodies the quality of Severity and Awe (Zohar 3:245a).
The would-be convert said, “Teach me the entire Torah [while I stand] on one leg” and Shammai pushed him away with the measuring stick he was holding. Shammai embodies Severity and Awe, and was holding a measuring stick that a builder uses at the start, to depict the entire building as one entity in their thoughts. And this plan does not endure. Afterwards, they build according to various [necessary] constrictions. In truth, the building changes from one day to the next, until it is finished, and then that is what endures. Understand.
And Hillel comes close to this would be convert, because Hillel is the embodiment of Kindness and Love. He teaches him about love, “What is hateful to you, [do not do to others]” which is the mitzvah of “Love your fellow as yourself...” (Lev. 19:18).
See the above-mentioned teachings, and understand for I grew tired from repeating the matter at length.
See, when the moon is renewed in her monthly renewal, she is a tiny point which increases and grows each day until she stands at her fullness on the fifteenth [day].
And increasing every day resembles the Torah, which a person adds to every day to their mind's understanding, until the understanding of their soul is brought out from potential to manifestation.
And the fullness of the moon resembles the Torah that a person reflects on [in the womb] before they are born into the air of this world, when they are taught the entire Torah (Niddah 30b). 
See the above-mentioned teaching about the Torah of Kindness and the Torah from the “Mouth of Severity” [i.e. G!d] and see what I wrote above about the constellation of the Bucket (Aquarius) being the constellation of Israel. And the bucket serves the water, which is Torah, therefore [this month contains] the New Year for the Trees for “a person is a tree of the field” (Deut. 20:19). 
And now you may understand that the first of Shevat is the [New Year for Trees] according to Beit Shammai, who come from the side of Severity.
And the Fifteenth of the month is the [New Year for Trees] according to Beit Hillel, who come from the side of Kindness and Love. Therefore [for Beit Shammai] the Mishnah (Rosh Hashanah 1:1) says “like the House of Shammai” using a Chaf to mean “like.” Understand these allusions.

<b>And</b> magic can not rule over someone born in the second Adar (Rabbenu Ephraim on the Torah, cited by the great Rabbi Chida [Chaim David Azulai] in the book, Devash LeFi). And it appears to me that this is because magic is done according to the order of the constellations at a certain time and a certain day with unusual acts; but this month has no constellation (<i>mazal</i>), since it is added to the twelve. And I heard in passing that the decree of Haman was on a second Adar; and so is it found in the books of the earlier ones. And what appears correct to me in this is that the wicked Haman was surely a great magician - and see about this in the writings of the Ari, may his memory be blessed. And you should know that he was in the aspect of the primordial serpent (<i>nachash</i>), he was a diviner (<i>menachesh</i>) and a magician; and so too with all Amalekites. But behold, God, may He be blessed, reversed his plan, with that which He acted and made the lot fall out on the month of second Adar, when there is no constellation. So magic does not rule over it. And it is also mentioned above concerning the towering heights that there is no constellation (<i>mazal</i>) with the Jewish people, since they are above the constellations. And this will be explained, God willing, later on on the verse, "Hence they called these days Purim (Lots) because of the lot" (Esther 9:26). And with this you will find a good reason why they established the reading of the Scroll [of Esther] specifically in the second Adar (and not the first).

<b>In this it will be spoken about the commandment of the Purim meal, and that a person is supposed to become 'spiced,' etc. And the name of this essay is, The Party and the Joyful Occasion:<br>The custom</b> of the Jewish people is [considered like something from the] Torah. They have followed the practice to change into different clothes during the meal and Purim party, and 'this is not an empty matter.' So behold I have contemplated 'from the lattice' at the Torah (creative work) of the famous rabbi, our master, the rabbi, Moshe Chagiz - that it is in memory of that which our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said, "They only did it (when they bowed down to an image in the days of Nevuchadnezzar) on the surface (<i>lefanim</i>, which is related to the word for face); so too did the Holy One, blessed be He only do it (the decree of annihilation) on the surface with them. Hence they change their clothes at the time of the joyous occasion, so that it will not be known whose face it is. This is something pleasant concerning the simple understanding of the custom.

<b>But</b> I [also] want to say that which I found in my heart: I saw in the Zohar, Sh'lach 169b: Rabbi Shimon said to him, "I certainly know that you are clothed there (in the Garden of Eden) with precious garments of a holy body. [But] is there like this in this world - people that appear with that body in the way you are appearing in that world?" (Meaning to say, whether it once happened in this world that a person was clothed with this garments and the precious spiritual body that exists in the Garden of Eden.) He said to him, "This thing they asked before the head of the yeshivah, etc. And he said to them, 'Indeed it has been so in this world.' From where do we [know it]? Since it is written (Esther 5:1), 'On the third day, Esther put on royal (<i>malkhut</i>) apparel.' She was clothed with that appearance from that world. <i>Malkhut</i> is the holy spirit. For behold the kingdom (<i>malkhut</i>) of the Heavens blows the spirit from the spirit of the air of that world, and Esther was clothed with it. So when she came before Ahasuerus like that and he saw that she was dressed in light, her appearance similar to that of an angel of God, his soul departed from him temporarily. (In this [manner], the verse, 'And it was (<i>Vayehi</i>), when the king saw Esther, etc.' is set aright. [Otherwise], why do I need, '<i>vayehi</i>,' which is an expression of distress? It should have said, 'And when the king saw.' Rather it is to make us understand that 'oy' and distress came - his soul departed temporarily from the great fright - so does it appear to me.) And Mordekhai was also like this, as it is written (Esther 8:15), 'Mordeakhi left the king’s presence in royal (<i>malkhut</i>) garments.' Certainly <i>Malkhut</i>) garments; it was the appearance of that world! And that is why it is written (Esther 9:3), 'since the fear of Mordekhai fell upon them.' The fear of Mordekhai, and not the fear of Ahasuerus?!?" Rabbi Shimon said, "How sweet are these words, fortunate is my portion! I knew that the righteous in this world are clothed by garments that are called royal (<i>malkhut</i>) garments, and it is certainly so!"  He said to him, "The air of the Garden of Eden blows the holy spirit which they are, and the righteous are clothed in the way that is the case in that world. And afterwards, the holy spirit sits upon the head of each and every one and crowns them, and it becomes a crown for him. And so it was with Mordekhai (in this world, so does it appear to me): As it is written, 'in royal (<i>malkhut</i>) garments' - the appearance of that world. And afterwards, 'with a magnificent crown of gold' - that is the crown that sits on the head of the righteous in that world. The Jewish people received the Torah in that fashion. As they had it until, etc." To here is [the Zohar]. And from here, behold 'what is yours is before you.' The custom of the Jewish people is [considered like something from the] Torah. They have followed the practice to change into different clothes during the joyful occasion in memory of the miracle and the wonder that God, may He be blessed, performed with Mordekhai and Esther. For they were clothed with precious spiritual garments that clothe the righteous in the Garden of Eden. And behold you see in the words of the Zohar that it was such with the Jewish people at the receiving of the Torah. And according to this, you can understand what our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 88a), "They received [the Torah] again during the days of Ahasuerus."
