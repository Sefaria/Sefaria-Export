Afterwards, the cantor got up on his feet and testified that once they studied Torah before our Godly master, the Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be blessed; and a fire burned all around them; until they were purified very much and received the Torah from the mouth of our teacher in the same way that the Israelites received [it] on Mount Sinai. It was with voices and lightning - 'and the call of the shofar was very powerful.' It was truly like Mount Sinai. 
For these voices were never removed, as they were Godly; but they require holiness and purification. And our aforementioned holy rabbi answered, "I have not grasped this, but it is not a wonder. Since his service and his holiness were from Israel, our Godly teacher was very very [great]; and especially when his service was on the Dniester River, which is a place of purity. And [such is referred to] from the mouth of Achiyah the Shiloni - 'fortunate is the one born from a woman that merited this.'" And all those who had awe who heard this understood that all of these virtues that were mentioned above were also [found] in our Rabbi Elimelekh - may his memory be a blessing for life in the world to come - or similar to [them].

Comment 1

1. With the help of Hashem Yisbarach, in His Holy United name...
2. Breishet. I received from the Rav Hamochiach (preacher or reprove) who said in the name of the Baal Shem Tov, that when the Messiah comes, speedily in our days, the whole Torah will be explained (or interpreted) from the beginning to the end, on all the combinations in each and every word. And after this, he will make from the whole Torah one word, and he will elevate combinations without number, and he will expound upon all the combinations. (Teshuot Chen, Parshah Tazria). 

Comment 2

1. "In the beginning G-d created", etc. To resolve the problem that was difficult for all the Rishonim, may their memories be for a blessing, why did the Holy One not create the world before this time? In that this action/deed is immediate good from absence. And why did His Will, may He be blessed, change, will to will in the moment of creation and not before this, behold He, blessed is His Name, is not a Master of Change? Of this it is written (Malachi 3:6) "I Hashem do not (or have not) change".
2. And the solution of this [problem is] that He does not resemble the acts of flesh and blood. The wisdom that he has now he did not have from before. And his wisdom he acquired (or possessed), and he is (at) a disadvantage. For instance, because of what he needs prior to living in it, therefore he acquires wisdom to build himself a house, then he builds himself the house. But He, praise His Name, His Wisdom is intrinsic and not acquired and He is not at a disadvantage. And therefore this is the Will that rose in His Will to create the world, not that he renewed for Himself this Will at the time of the creation of the world. Rather, like He is ancient, so his His Will is ancient. And this (early desire) was His immediate Will to create the World in this moment when He created it and not before. And therefore in the moment the world was created it was created truly in that moment and in that time, just like it was in His Will before to create it. Specifically in this moment, and if so reasonably He had no change in His Will whatsoever.
The proof of this is the world as it will be in the time to come, "the world that is entirely Shabbat, [where] the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads" (Berachot 17:a), and none but God will be exalted on that day (Isaiah 2:11). Certainly that world is at a higher [spiritual] level than the world is now, and such an event/reality certainly is better than its absence. So why did the Holy One Blessed Be He not begin with this, [but rather arrange it so that] all this must come at its own era and time - just as Shabbat comes only after the six profane days?  In regard to the creation of the world, even though the Holy One Blessed be He knew that its existence was better than its absence, nonetheless, He placed His Will in opposition to His [fore]knowledge and so made this [present world] come first.  Though he knew that this act [creating the world in an ideal state] was good, still He desired to not bring this about until its appointed time. So He ignored His knowledge and followed His will.  That which preceded creation can be likened to the world that is entirely Shabbat, and this is as the verse says (Kohelet 3:11) He brings everything to pass precisely at its time, even the world [this is reading against the p'shat of the Kohelet verse].  This is a very deep secret that one who understands [Kabbalah] will comprehend.

We learned "a person sees all defects, except (chutz) their own defects" (M. Nega'im 2:5) and the holy Ba'al Shem Tov explained that "a person sees all defects outside (chutz)" - what they see is a continuation of that person's defects, as our sages say "he disqualifies others with his own flaw."

<i>Amud Hatefillah</i> - The Pillar of Prayer

Comment 15

"Make an opening [<i>tzohar</i>] for the ark [<i>teivah</i>], closing up to a cubit at the top." (Genesis 6:16) -- The Baal Shem Tov, peace be upon him, explained these words in the following way: let the word (<i>teivah</i>) said in Torah or in prayer radiate light  (<i>matzhir</i>)! For in every letter there are worlds, souls and divinity, that rise up and interconnect and cleave to one another and to the divine. Afterwards, these letters connect and conjoin, finally becoming a word. After that, they connect and unify unifications of  truth in the Divine - and one must unify one's soul with each of the aforementioned aspects. In this way, all the worlds rise and become as one, and then there is immense joy and immeasurable delight. This is the meaning of "...bottom, second, and third decks," (Genesis 6:16) - that is the worlds, souls and divinities, as it says (Zohar I:159a) "there are three worlds, etc." In each and every word one must listen to what is being spoken, since the Shechina is the world of speech, as it is says (Zohar III:230a) "She speaks and He is Her escort." "<i>Tzohar</i>" - this 'opening' for light - that everything should be illuminated with clarity, giving pleasure to the Creator. One needs great faith (<i>Emunah</i>) for this, since the Shechinah Herself is called <i>Emunat Amen</i>, faithful faith (Zohar II:16b). Without faith, Heaven forbid, She is called (Proverbs 16:28) "A querulous one who alienates their friend." As for the end of the verse, "closing up to a cubit (<i>amah</i>)" -- this is the Mother (<i>Ima</i>). It could be said that after the word leaves one's mouth, it does not need to be remembered again, one does not see that it rises to an elevated place, just as one can not look at the sun, as it says, "closing up at the top." How does one do all this? "Go into the ark [<i>teivah</i>], you and all your household." (Genesis 7:1) -- this means that with all your body and strengths, you shall enter the word [<i>teivah</i>]!

Comment 16

In prayer, one needs to exert all one's energy in the speech, moving from one letter to the other until one completely forgets corporeality. One should see the letters joining and combining with each other, and this is great joy! If it is joyful in the material world, how much more so in the realm of the spirit - the world of <i>yetzirah</i> , formation. Once the thought is directed towards the letters, one does not even hear what one is saying - this is arriving at the world of <i>beriah</i>, creation. Afterwards, one arrives to the aspect of <b>Nothingness</b>, when all one's bodily forces are annulled, and this is the world of <i>atzilut</i>, emanation, and the sefirah of <i>chochmah</i>, wisdom. 

Comment 17

"Make an opening (<i>tzohar</i>) in the ark (<i>teivah</i>)" (Genesis 6:16) --My grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov, may he rest in Eden, illuminated this passage. He said that <i>teivah</i> actually means 'word', and the meaning of making an opening for the word is that you should be careful to bring light into the words that come from your lips. The verse continues: "Make bottom and second and third floors." This seems to be what my grandfather related to me, saying that in every word are worlds, souls, and divinities. This is what is meant by <i>teivah</i>, speech, which also has at its most basic level worlds. The second level is also known as <i>mishneh</i>, secondary, which has the same letters as <i>neshamah</i>, soul - this is the level of souls. And the third level (<i>shelishim</i>) is divinities, which is hinted at in the verse (Exodus 14:7), "Officers (<i>shalishim</i>) [ruling] over all of them," like the Divine who rules over all things. All of these levels you should "Make" - the speech and the word coming out of your mouth should have this intention and be in complete faithfulness, knowing that in each act of speech there are bottom and second and third levels, the worlds, souls and divinities --- Understand this!

Comment 18

The Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory said on the verse (Gen 16:6) "Make an opening for the ark (<i>teivah</i>)" - one should let light flow into the word (<i>teivah</i>) of prayer. The verse continues, "closing up to a cubit above" -- meaning, one draws sustenance to the Shechinah from above.

Comment 19

I heard in the name of the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, that he explained the verse (Genesis 16:6) "Make an opening for the ark (<i>teivah</i>)" - one should turn the words (<i>teivah</i>) of Torah and of prayer into an illuminated opening, to look and see from the beginning of the world until its end.

Comment 20

The Baal Shem Tov, may his memory guard us, would explain the verse (Genesis 6:16) "Make an opening (<i>tzohar</i>) for the ark (<i>teivah</i>)."  <i>Tzohar</i> actually means light, and  <i>teivah</i> actually means speech. This means that when a Jew wants to speak, they must make sure that one's thought illuminates the words first, because thought (<i>machshavah</i>) is the same letters and connected to <i>chashav mah</i>, 'think of the object'.

Comment 21

My grandfather of blessed memory explained the secret of the verse (Genesis 6:16) "lower and second and third decks" - that one should make ones petitions from the letters, from the mystery of the divine light that dwells within them, and make the petition come from there, etc.

Comment 22

One should certainly make their petitions from the letters themselves, as I heard from my father of blessed memory. He explained that these petitions can come from the divine mystery within them, to ask that for help, that one may express these letters with true intention, for their own sake. In this way, all harsh judgements are sweetened at their core.

Comment 23

I heard from my father of blessed memory that the letters are without meaning. 

Comment 24

I also heard that each and every word includes within it the entire world -- and "words from the mouth of the wise are grace!" (Kohelet 10:12)

Comment 25

Know that each and every word is an entire body, and one's entire strength must be put into it, for if not, it will be like one with a missing limb.

Comment 26

One who says their prayers with all the intentions (<i>kavannot</i>) that they know - this person is not only intending in the way that they know, but in saying the words with great communion with God, each and every word naturally comprises of all the intentions on its own. For each letter is an entire world, and when one says the word with great communion, certainly those supernal worlds are aroused, and one makes great actions thereby. Therefore, one should be careful to pray with passion and with great communion, and this will certainly cause reaction in the supernal worlds, since every letter causes arousal above.

Comment 27

So too, if one's prayer be pure and clear, one's sacred breath coming out of their mouth in prayer will join and connect with the supernal breath that constantly comes into one. As our Holy Sages said on the verse (Psalms 150:6) "Every living soul (<i>neshamah</i>) will praise God," - this means that with each and every breath (<i>neshimah</i>) that one breathes out, from below to above and returns from above to below - certainly through this some piece of divinity from the person is now connected to its root.

Comment 28

The Rabbi's soul told him that the reason that he merited that supernal things were revealed to him was not because he had studied much Talmud and halachic codes, but because he had always prayed with great intention, <i>kavannah gedolah</i>, and for this he merited to attain such a level.

Comment 29

The Baal Shem Tov revealed that even though one prays with great cleaving and with the proper levels of love and fear - even so, one must be sure to also have the proper submission to the Holy One. One time he and his disciples were praying with great cleaving, but without submission, and there was great opposition above, and only one of them who had submitted and was thereby saved.

Comment 30

The Baal Shem Tov said that one who reads from the Torah and sees the light of the letters in the Torah -- if even they didn't understand the cantillation correctly, since they had read with great love and passion, the Holy One is not exacting with the reader, even though the words weren't read correctly. This can be compared to a young child beloved by her father. When she asks for something from her father, even if she stutters and makes mistakes, the father has great joy. Therefore, when one says words of Torah with love, the Holy One has much love towards them and isn't exacting as to whether they spoke correctly, as our rabbis of blessed memory taught (Song of Songs 2:4) "His banner (<i>diglo</i>) of love is over me." - don't read this word as <i>diglo</i>, but as <i>ligluglo</i>, His mockery of love is over me. 

Comment 31

One needs to guard one's mouth and tongue with regard to all speech. Even in terms of permitted speech our blessed sages were strict, as they said (Berachot 14a) that one should not even say hello to a person, since even this is destructive before the morning prayer. It is known that the world was created through thought, speech and action. Thought is the most primary, and speech is a branch of thought, and action is a branch of speech. So too, when a person wakes up from their sleep and becomes a new creature, as it is written (Eichah 3:23) "Renewed every morning" - if one begins by speaking permitted speech, and all the more so that which is not permitted! - even if one continues by praying and studies Torah, everything branches out from this first speech-act. Just as speech is a branch of thought and inferior to it, so too is the second speech-act to the first, as it says in the Zohar 2:83a and in the writings of Isaac Luria on respecting one's older brother, since the eldest brother takes the principal share and the other siblings are continuations from him. So too here, and therefore one should be careful to sanctify one's first speech-act, purifying one's first thought that it cleave to holiness so that it draws towards it all subsequent acts of speech. Afterwards, standing in prayer with the joy of performing a commandment, just as one's speech and thought were sanctified in this way, one's prayer will surely be answered. 

Comment 32

Everything one sees should be a reminder of the Holy Blessed One! If it is love, one should recall the love of God. If it is fear, one should recall fear of God. We know this from several sources. And even when one goes to the toilet, one should think: behold, I am separating bad from good, and the good will remain to worship Him, may He be blessed! All such thoughts are divine unifications.

Comment 33

"Justice goes before Him, as He sets out on His way." (Psalms 85:14) -- There is a moral teaching here. There are some people who, on their way to fulfil the <i>mitzvah</i> of prayer or some such thing, stop to speak to other people. Even though they afterwards go on to the <i>mitzvah</i>, they have transgressed in not having run with passion, and their punishment after their death will be similar in nature. We know from several books that [after death] one passes over a river on a very narrow bridge, and this is considered as difficult suffering, for one has fear and trembling and needs to run very fast. This is the only way, on a very narrow bridge, to run fast. And then in the middle of the bridge, the Holy One sends an interrupting angel! And this is the very same angel that was created from that <i>mitzvah</i> that was interrupted and caused pain to this angel. From the thought that one had at home, intending to perform the <i>mitzvah</i>, a soul was created for the angel, and in actually performing the <i>mitzvah</i>, a body was created. But since one delayed the creation of that body, tarrying along the way and speaking to people, this angel comes to delay one, and not allow one to run, and this will be very frightening. This is the meaning of "Justice goes before Him," -- the simple meaning is that all one's <i>mitzvot</i> walk before one after death. But when one is careful to go quickly and passionately when going to perform a <i>mitzvah</i> or to the synagogue, and not with laziness, "He sets out on His way" and doesn't interrupt the person crossing the river.

Comment 34

"Kindness is yours, God, and You will pay each man according to his deeds." (Psalms 62:13) The difficulty on this verse is well-known. Yet it seems to apply to the story told by the holy Baal Shem Tov, that once there was a strong indictment against the Jews on Yom Kippur. Satan said that he was not talking at all about the wicked people, but rather about good and God-fearing people. Such people who would come to pray in the synagogue every day, but on their way to pray would see a carriage carrying firewood, and would start haggling over the price and get a small discount, on account of which they would come to the synagogue late, after <i>barechu</i> and <i>kedusha</i>. All the defending angels above have nothing to say in defence of this. But the Baal Shem Tov had something to say. He said: it is true that before performing the <i>mitzvah</i>, they were willing to give it up for a small sum. But after performing the <i>mitzvah</i>, even if they would have been offered a large sum of money, nobody would give it up, not even the simple-minded. And on account of this defence, the harsh decrees were sweetened. This is the meaning of the verse "Kindness is yours, God, and You will pay each man according to his deeds" - that is, according to the <i>mitzvah</i> after it was done, not before it was done. 

Comment 35

I heard from my teacher of blessed memory that it happens that some need to strengthen themselves before prayer, in order to have the mental channels (<i>mochin</i>) open to pray without any foreign thoughts at all, or to pray with cleaving. This is done by singing or by studying Torah before standing to pray, and this opens up the mental channels. There are some, however, who when they begin with many songs and Torah study have no mental channels open for prayer. This is the meaning of the Talmudic teaching (Menachot 110a): "One who brings much or one who brings little [are equal], as long as their heart is directed towards heaven" - as long as one has these mental channels, <i>mochin</i>, they are equal. We have thus solved the difficulty brought up by the Taz (on Orach Chayim 1:4) - and the words of the wise are pleasant. 

Comment 36

One should not recite many psalms before prayer, in order not to tire the body and not be able afterwards to say the main parts of the prayer, the obligation of the day, with great cleaving: namely, the [obligatory] psalms, the Shema, and the standing prayer. One loses their strength on other things before getting to these parts of the prayer. At first, one should only say the main parts of the prayer with great cleaving, and if God gives them additional strength then they should also say other psalms and the Song of Songs with great cleaving. The same applies on Yom Kippur before Neilah, one should say the fixed order of prayer minimally, in order to be able to pray with great cleaving.

Comment 37

Our sages taught (Pesachim 117a) that whenever a psalm begins with "A song to David (<i>mizmor leDavid</i>)", that indicates that he would first play music and only then would the <i>Shechinah</i> descend on him. The song would bring the holy spirit to David. And whenever the psalm begins "To David, a song (<i>leDavid mizmor</i>)", first the <i>Shechinah</i> would descend upon him with the holy spirit, and afterwards he would recite poetry. But when we recite the Book of Psalms ourselves, we should be humble and embarrassed, for when does the holy spirit enter us, whether before or after? As such, we should be careful to say the psalms in holiness and in purity, in awe and wonder.

Comment 38

It was taught in the name of the Baal Shem Tov, that he used to instruct his disciples to study a teaching of Zohar before every time they prayed.

Comment 39

One should take care to pray, whether in summer or in winter, before the rising of the sun. That is, the majority of the prayer, almost up to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, before the sun rises. For the distance between before and after sunrise is as the distance between East and West, since before it rises one can still easily nullify the forces of harshness. This can be seen in the verse (Psalms 19:6) "And he (the sun) is like a groom going forth from his canopy, eager as a hero, etc... and nothing is hidden from his heat (<i>michamato</i>)." Don't read this word as <i>michamato</i>, but rather <i>micheimato</i>, "from his anger!" This means that once the sun has gone out over the land, then nothing is hidden from the forces of harshness that derive from the fiery angels of the sun. This matter, therefore, should not be seen as insignificant in your eyes, for it is a great matter. The Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be a blessing, would be very particular about this, and occasionally he would rather pray at this time alone, if a <i>minyan</i> could not be gathered.

Comment 40

In the name of our master, the Baal Shem Tov - may his soul rest in the chambers up high - the reason for it being forbidden to start one's Amida prayer before the rest of the community begins (as mentioned in the Talmud, Berachot 28b, and in the Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 90:10) is because it is prior to the will and the consent of the limbs.

Comment 41

One should sense oneself, before prayer, that one is ready to die in the upcoming prayer, from the intensity of the feeling of <i>kavvannah</i>, attunement. There are those who are so strongly attuned that occasionally they could physically die, in two or three words that they present before the Blessed One. When one reflects upon this, one should say in one's heart: what request or pride should I have in this prayer, since I am prepared to die after two or three words. In truth, it is out of great kindness from the Blessed One that one is given the strength to complete their prayer and remain alive.

Comment 42

It is from the enormous kindness of the Blessed One that anyone remains alive after prayer, since in the way of nature one ought to have died after expending all their strength, having put all their strength in prayer, from the intensity of their attunement. 

Comment 43

In the name of the Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be a blessing, it was said that it is truly a miracle that one lives after prayer, and that that one's soul did not depart from the intensity of cleaving.

Comment 44

One who speaks without thinking is like one who spills their seed, God forbid! For man's conception is an entire body (<i>shiur koma</i>), and the proof of this is that when one thinks of someone else during sexual intercourse, one gives birth to a 'child of substitution' (cf. Nedarim 20b), while when one imagines nothing at all, one can not engage in intercourse. Thought is of the divine aspect of <i>Chochma</i>, Wisdom, and speech is born from it. Even in thought there are letters, for one's thoughts are structured by letters, and when doesn't think while speaking he is like one who spills his seed, since speech is his vitality.

Comment 45

When one is on a lowly spiritual level, it is surely better to pray from the <i>siddur</i>, the prayer book, since the power of seeing the letters brings one to pray with more intense attunement. Yet when one cleaves to the supernal worlds, it is far better to  close one's eyes in order not to interrupt the vision that is cleaving to those supernal worlds.


Comment 46

The wise person has the sense and 'eyes in their head' to know: if the time is ripe to become attuned through inner mysteries and delight etc., how good! But if one sees that they are in the mystery of smallness and cannot find attunement, when distracting thoughts overpower them - in this case, one should pray like a day-old child from the written text. This was attested to by my teacher, when he was in a foreign land for some time in such a state, and everything escaped him - he would cleave himself to the letters. He said that when one prays from the written text and cleaves to the letters themselves, they rise to the level of Action. (For the word '<i>ktav</i>', 'writing,' is an abbreviation of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Malchut</i>, which is the letter <i>tav</i>, through <i>Binah</i>.) All this was instructed to a certain individual who did so until he returned to his higher state - and the words of the wise are gracious!


Comment 47

One needs to proceed step by step in prayer, and not spend all one's strength at the beginning. Rather, one should start slowly, and in the middle cleave with intense cleaving, so that one can utter all the words of the prayer quickly. Even if at the beginning of the prayer, one is unable to pray with intense cleaving, one should still say the words in utter attunement. Slowly, one builds up the strength until God helps them be able to cleave intensely in prayer.

Comment 48

So too, when one falls from one's high level in prayer, one should say the next word with as little <i>kavannah</i> as possible, and then draw strength to return to one's place, doing so even multiple times for each level. At first, one should cleave the the body of the word. Next, one should give a soul to the word! One should also physically arouse oneself at the beginning with all one's strength, so that the soul is illuminated. This was explained in the Zohar (Zohar 3:168a) "If wood doesn't kindle, it should be struck until it lights." Afterwards, one can worship in thought only, without movements of the body. 

Comment 49

It is impossible to attain attuned prayer without encouragement; one needs, therefore, to plead to the Holy One for assistance and help.

Comment 50

One should think and hope that the Blessed God will give  assist them in attaining attunement for half of the prayer service, or even the majority of it. In the end, when one loses strength and the cleaving is broken off, what is to be done? One should pray as best as one can, with lesser attunement, until the end of <i>Aleinu</i>.

Comment 51

It can happen that one is praying on a lowly level, and suddenly in a flash their soul is illuminated and rises to upper worlds, like a person ascending a ladder, as it is written (Psalms 43:3) "Send forth Your light and Your truth, they shall guide me," - referring to the supernal illumination.

Comment 52

It can happen that one is worshipping only on a lowly level - that is, they don't enter upper worlds at all - yet they can ponder that the entire world is filled with God's glory, and that God is close to them. In times like this, the praying person is like a child, whose mind is not very great at all. Even if one is worshipping thus on a lowly level, they are still worshipping with intense cleaving. 

Comment 53

Even when one falls from their spiritual level, one should cleave to the Creator in smallness of thought. For even above there is smallness too, in <i>Ze'ir Anpin</i>, the 'small face' of the Divine. And from this smallness one can come to greatness, like with coals: if there even one spark that remains, one can blow on it strongly until it becomes a huge fire. This is not the case when there is not even one small spark, there no fire can be raised. So too, if one is not constantly cleaving with a small thought to the Blessed One, their soul might be extinguished - God forbid!

Comment 54

There are times that you cannot pray - yet in such situations you should not believe that you will not pray at all on this day! Rather, you should find even more strength, and let more and more fear fall upon yourself. This is similar to a king going out to battle and disguising himself: the wise recognise him from his movements; and those who are not so wise recognise him from his effect, since wherever there is heavy security, that is where the king is. So too, when you cannot pray with attunement, you should know that there are guards around the king - truly, the King is there, but one cannot draw close on account of the guards around him. Therefore, you must find strength and awe, and with great might and focus, in order to draw close and pray before the Blessed One - only then can you pray with intense attunement.

Comment 55

One should not say that "When I am able to pray with passion I will pray, but if not, I will not force myself to pray." On the contrary! This is similar to a king who goes out to battle and disguises himself. Those close to the royal court recognise the king from his movements; those far from royal life only see that the people come close together in a certain place, and infer that surely the king is there. So too, when one cannot pray, the King is being guarded in order not to be revealed. Therefore one should find more strength, since the King is nearby, and being hidden from one's view.

Comment 56

When one is on a lowly level, they should also cleave well to the <i>Shechina</i>, and then - suddenly! - in a single moment when one thinks of the higher worlds, they will immediately be there. Because one is always in the place of one's thoughts, and if one was not in the higher worlds, one would not be able to think of them at all. 

Comment 57

None can properly pray unless they are surrounded by <i>Or Makif</i>, by illumination from all sides, and one should feel it surrounding them. 

Comment 58

When one first desires to pray, it should come from a sense of awe, which is the gate to reach the Holy One (Shabbat 31b). One should say in their heart: "To whom do I wish to cleave? To the Creator, to the One who spoke all worlds into being, who grants them existence and sustains them!" One should ponder God's greatness and power, and in this can enter the higher worlds. 

Comment 59

There are some who pray in melancholy, from an excess of black bile, and think that they are praying with great awe. So too, there are some who think that they are praying out of great love for the Creator, on account of their blood, the red humour. When, however, one is in a state of loving God, and as a result shame falls upon them, and they want to glorify the Blessed One and defeat the evil urge on God's account - this is very good. One is not considered a worshipper of God without the qualities of awe and love. One should allow awe to fall on them, and not arouse themselves to awe, which would be drawing up the <i>mayim nukvin</i>, the feminine waters. Real awe is when fear and terror fall upon you, and out of fear you have no idea where you are, and the mind clears and tears fall on their own. When it is not like this, even though it may seem that one loves the Creator, it is surely not so for "This is the gate to God" (Psalms 118:20): awe is the gate that leads to love, and if one does not go through the gate of awe, how can one be in a state of love? Such a person is not even a servant, much less a person on the level of having awe fall on them - they are not worshipping in a way that befits a Jew at all, only serving God out of automatic reflexes (Isaiah 29:13) and fooling themselves that they are actually serving God and worshipping God with joy. This is nothing but flippant joy, and one should return to God with their entire heart and soul. 

Comment 60

Prayer in the midst of great joy is certainly more accepted before the Blessed One than the prayer of sadness and tears. This is similar to a poor person who begs and pleads before the king, crying profusely: nonetheless, the king only gives them a small amount. But when the minister joyfully praises the king, and presents a request alongside it, the king generously gives a much greater amount.

Comment 61

"We will make wreaths of gold with spangles of silver" (Song of Songs 1:11). 'Wreaths of gold' - this is awe; 'Spangles of silver' - this is love. One should not, therefore, speak Torah and prayer to the outside, since from this the <i>kelipot</i>, the hard outer shells are created and take the form of evil people who take revenge on us. I heard such things from my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov. This is what the sages meant (Rashi on Genesis 6:18) in saying that Noah needed protection not to be killed by the wicked of his generation. Try to understand this! One needs awe more than one needs love, the 'spangles of silver'. All this I heard from my teacher. 

Comment 62

I heard from my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov, that one's external motives, which are themselves an entire body, create the person who comes to harm them.

Comment 63

You should't say "On Shabbat I will pray with <i>kavannah</i>, but not during the week." Do not be like servants of the king who work fervently in his presence, and when he is not present, have no eagerness in their work. Such a person is not a faithful servant. But since it becomes evident that being without the king is bad for you, you must push past all the guards until you come before the king - even if you don't know how to speak in his presence, and are not fit to stand before him. Be that as it may, the King will respond to your desires, for he is flowing with great mercy. 

Comment 64

"All the days of poverty are wretched" (Proverbs 15:15) -- In light of what our Sages of blessed memory taught (Nedarim 41a), "Poverty means nothing but a lack of wisdom", this verse means the following: "All the days of poverty" - this is lack of wisdom - "are wretched" - meaning, your prayer and your learning are nothing to the Blessed One, because they are lacking in awe and in love, and they do not fly upwards (cf. Tikkunei Hazohar 10). On this verse, the Talmud (Bava Batra 146a) questions - but what about Shabbat and festivals? Surely on these days every person is aroused from above, and prays in a state of attunement. The answer is given that there is a change of habit, which causes wretchedness: you see yourself praying with attunement and are filled with pride and grandeur. Seeing yourself rise to this high level, even so, there is wretchedness since "a change of habit leads to sickness of the bowels" - the evil urge only acts during eating and drinking (Zohar 1:110a), and in this sense, you are filled with pride. This is evident to those who can understand. 

Comment 65

I heard this in the name of the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, who would say: A grave transgression is committed by the praying community, when the leader of prayer doesn't lengthen the singing and wants to end a part of the prayer, but the community continues with a lengthy prayer. By doing so, they prevent the leader of prayer from channelling the Divine Flow. If he needs to wait until the public finishes their prayer, this way or that his heightened consciousness will be weakened, and he won't have the correct consciousness to channel the Flow from the Divine Presence. If so, how careful must the community be in order to make sure that they do not cause such a thing, God forbid, and lose such great goodness. On account of this, the Baal Shem Tov truly saw what a weighty task both sides, the leader and the community, take upon themselves in knowing how to act during prayer - especially the leader. 

Comment 66

There are times when you desire to pray with passion but cannot, because your limbs feel heavy to you. The Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory said that King David prayed on this matter, saying (Psalms 71:9) "Do not cast me away in my old age" - meaning, when my limbs are heavy as if I were old. 

Comment 67

The Baal Shem Tov explained the verse (Psalms 71:9) "Do not cast me away in the time (<i>le'et</i>) of my old age." This means that you should not cast away the moment (<i>et</i>) and let it grow old. For sometimes it happens that your worship grows old as time goes by. 

Comment 68

The words of the divine master, the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory. Regarding the verse (Psalms 71:9) "Do not cast me away in my old age," one could ask - did he not need help also in his youth? Rather, the meaning is that sometimes you have passion for something, Torah or prayer, but this desire doesn't mature but rather drops off suddenly. It is as if the mitzvah grew old, as in the phrase (cited in Tur, Orach Chaim 61) "like an old letter." It was in this regard that he said: Don't cast me away from passion! Don't let me see myself as an old person reading an old letter - let it become a new letter for me!

Comment 69

You should accustom yourself to pray even songs in a low voice, and to shout silently. You should say each word, whether in song or in study, with all your strength, as it is written (Psalms 35:10) "All my bones shall speak, etc." The shouting that comes from intense cleaving should be like a whisper.

Comment 70

Sometimes, you must worship the Holy One with your soul alone, in thought, and the body stays in its place so it does not get hurt through being used intensely. Sometimes, you can pray with love, awe and passion without a single movement, and it will seem to someone else that they are being said without any intense cleaving. This can only be done with the utmost cleaving to the Holy One; only then can God be worshipped in the soul alone with great love. Such worship is better and goes faster and with stronger cleaving to the Holy One than prayer that can be seen outwardly in the limbs. The external forces, the <i>kelipot</i>, have no way to grasp a prayer that is utterly internal. 

Comment 71

Sometimes, you can say the prayer very quickly out of the love for the Holy One  burning fiercely in your heart, and the words leave your mouth on their own.

Comment 72

In order to purify the mind, I have received a tradition from my teacher the Baal Shem Tov (may his memory guard us, and may God protect and guard him): one should attune the mind to the divine name <i>KUZU</i>. Our teacher wrote that this name stems from wisdom, <i>chochmah</i>, from which thought derives, and it has the aspect of <i>din</i>, judgement. The full spelling of this name, consisting of the letters <i>Kaf, Vav, Zayin, Vav</i> spelled out, is equal to <i>taftafiah</i>, the name of thought. So he said. 

Comment 73

I fear to put down in writing the awe-inspiring words I heard from my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov, regarding the path to sweeten the harsh judgements known as '<i>Shach v'Par</i>', and to ameliorate mental distractions by using the name <i>Shadai</i> and its inverse, as well as the four-letter name of God and its inverse. However, I scribbled down notes for myself. 

Comment 74

This is the mystery of the name <i>KHH</i> and its inverse, <i>Shadai</i>, by which Moses killed the Egyptian, and cast the spark dwelling in a place of filth back to its source. This name is fitting for this, as we know from the holy master, the Baal Shem Tov, may his memory guard us, who described how to use this name to raise all the sparks, etc.

Comment 75

I heard in the name of the Baal Shem Tov that the name <i>KUZU</i> is the 'back' of the four-letter name. The four-letter name is mercy, and <i>KUZU</i> is the aspect of the concealed back, and is power. The first and last letters of the name equal twenty-six, like the four-letter name itself. The remaining letters are <i>zu</i>. This is why it is said (Taanit 21a), "This (<i>zu</i>) too is for the best" - because even <i>zu</i> is truly for good, and included in loving-kindness.

Comment 76

I heard from my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, that whether learning or praying - if you understand the simple meaning of the words of prayer, or the halachic law, you connect the aspect of royalty, <i>Malchut</i>, which is speech, to understanding, <i>Bina</i>, which is thought. And the words of the wise are glorious!

Comment 77

The root of prayer is to connect the harsh justice at the core of <i>Malchut</i>, the divine aspect of Royalty. You need to sweeten the harsh judgements at its root, which is <i>Bina</i>, the divine aspect of Understanding. This I wrote elsewhere in the name of my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory.

Comment 78

The mystery of <i>Chashmal</i> mentioned in Ezekiel 1:4, the rabbis (Chagigah 13b) interpreted it as creatures that are sometimes silent (<i>Chashot</i>) and sometimes chattering (<i>memalelot</i>). From the language of <i>Chash mal</i>, learn that you must be silent until you strike out and cut up (<i>mal</i>) the evil forces, then speak up and cleave to the divine, to sweeten these harsh judgements at their root. This is the secret of prayer, as explained by my teacher the Baal Shem Tov, in the name of his teacher. 

Comment 79



Comment 80

You should intend in prayer to awaken the letters by which the heavens and the earth and all creatures and worlds, above and below, were created by. As such, in reciting prayer and praise, you are speaking together with all the worlds and all the creatures, because you are awakening the letters, and the letters are the vitality of all creation. Therefore, you are speaking together with all of them, and raise up all creatures, in heaven and on earth, by praying so. The enlightened ones who pray in such attunement are even able to awaken the letters of the simple people, and then they are also able to pray with greater attunement and passion, and return to being their best selves. The Baal Shem Tov revealed this, and told his disciples: you need to pray even for that chirping bird flying there. So too, in preaching words of Torah in order to rebuke people, this intention can be for their benefit - and he would remind us of this often. 

Comment 81

I heard it taught in the name of the Maggid, our master Menachem Mendel, that when giving over words of encouragement and rebuke to the people of the town, you should see to it that first connect yourself with the Blessed One, and then cleave and connect with all those people, in an aspect of unity and communion, for the leader of the generation shares a common root with the people of the town. When you do this, then your God is with you, and you should rise up together with them, to have them cleave to the Blessed One. This is what is said (in the Zohar 2:128b) "Happy is the one who holds the hand of the sinner etc.," seizing them by the hands and raising them up. As such, you achieve something immediately by rebuking and encouraging the people of Israel - and the words of the wise are glorious! I also heard such things from my teacher regarding prayer, that they can be raised in a similar way.

Comment 82

I heard in the name of my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov, regarding attuned prayer and unification: that you need to unite yourself with everything. Know that you are a miniature world, and with the arousal below there will be arousal above too, with bountiful goodness flowing down until it reaches the level of the person in attuned prayer, ready to receive it.

Comment 83

My master the Baal Shem Tov, whose soul now dwells in lofty chambers, explained the verse (Isaiah 7:11) "Ask for a sign (<i>ot</i>) from the Lord your God." The meaning is: you should plead and cry out to God for a letter (<i>ot</i>) - asking God that the letters spoken in prayer and in Torah study should be those joined to the Lord your God, and you should merit to connect them to their root. 

Comment 84

When you pray, contemplate on the letters that the Blessed God is clothed in. For we don't know what somebody thinks unless they speak - speech, therefore, is a garment of thought. You should say in your heart: I am creating a garment for the great King! I should do so with joy! Speak with all your strength, for by doing so you are able to unite with the Blessed God. For your strength is in the letters, and in the letters dwells the Holy One - and through these letters, therefore, unity is achieved.

Comment 85

There is no speech without thought, for you think before you speak. Therefore, when you think before prayer about what and to whom you are about to speak, certainly awe and shame will fall upon you, until speech itself seems an awesome thing. When you contemplate on the fact that the world of speech is actually the holy Shechina speaking through you, and unites all the aspects: fear, love, pride, and so on -- when you contemplate this, how can you not feel awe and shame, knowing that you are arousing the Shechina, as it were, and all these aspects. This is the meaning of (Psalms 103:20) "Those who do God's word-" that they turn speech into action. 

Comment 86

When you speak - keep in mind the mysteries of Voice and Speech, and speak with fear and with love. Think that the world of Speech is actually speaking through your mouth, and raise up all that you speak. 

Comment 87

The parable is a vessel of the mind, and so too are words the vessels of thought. When you speak without intention, this is a shattering of vessels, for there is no life in the vessels. And when you remove yourself from materiality, which is your body and your vessel, then you can see the essence of vessels: the life and lights in each of the letters. When you remove yourself from materiality and clothe yourself in words - then you cleave to the Blessed Creator, who is also clothed in words. Take care not to fall from these thoughts, and hold yourself, raise yourself upwards!

Comment 88

Bring all your thoughts into the power of the words that you speak, until you can see the sparks flashing in and between the words, and the light that is born of them. This is the meaning of (Psalms 97:11) "Light is sown for the righteous, and happiness for the upright." The letters of the Torah are chambers of the Blessed One, who fills them with the emanations of divine light. This is written too in the Holy Zohar (II:85b), that the Holy Blessed One and the Torah are essentially one. Into these chambers you must direct your attuned self, which is the soul. This is the act of cleaving, and as such, the Holy Blessed One and Torah and Israel are all one. This is what is meant by removing yourself from materiality, namely, that your soul is removed from your body, and rather have it clothed in the thoughts that are being spoken. Then you will surely see many supernal worlds. 

Comment 89

Contemplate this: the World of Speech speaks through you, and were it not so, it would not be possible to speak. This is the meaning of (Psalms 51:17) "Adonai, open my lips." So too with thought, which could not exist were it not for the upper World of Thought. You are like a Shofar, and what is blown into you is the sound that comes out. If you remove yourself from the breath blown in, no sound will come out. Therefore, without the strength of the Blessed One, God forbid, you could neither speak nor think. 

Comment 90

Contemplate this: in speech, it is the World of Speech that speaks through you; an enormous world by which all worlds were created. This is the meaning of the word (Genesis 2:4) בְּהִבָּרְאָם , "In their creation", which can be read 'created with ה' - referring to the five openings of the mouth. Contemplate further on the greatness of the Blessed One, in that all the life-force of all the worlds is contained in speech. This is the world of Awe, in which it is as if the Shechinah constricts itself and dwells within your words and in your mouth, as it says (Sefer Yetzirah 2:3) "God fixed the letters in the mouth." If speech is so, what is with the World of Thought? Even more brilliant lights, with no end and no way of grasping. When you contemplate such things and say in your heart: this is the contraction of the World of Thought in my mind, in my wisdom and understanding. Before such an enormous world, I should feel in awe. 

Comment 91

This is the meaning of praying <i>lishmah</i>, for its own sake. This really means for the sake of Speech, since Speech longs and yearns to cleave close to Thought. And when you speak with love and with awe, Voice and Speech join and play with each other, with wisdom watching over them, joyous like a father full of joy for his child. Thought craves to join together with Voice, in order to be expressed by Speech. 

Comment 92

The speech of a Jew comes from the upper world of Speech, which gives life to the world. So too, the thought of a Jew is from the upper world of Thought, a world that derives the letters that become speech through the divine attributes of <i>Chesed</i>, <i>Din</i> and <i>Rachamim</i> - Kindness, Judgement and Mercy. Because the world we inhabit has space and limitations, it can only receive through the channel of these attributes. It is like the sun, which can not be looked at directly on account of the intensity of its brightness, yet you can look at the light that comes from it, and enjoy and benefit from it because of its diminished intensity. Were it at the intensity of the sun itself, you would not be able to comprehend it at all. This is the meaning of (Psalms 84:12) "For God is sun and shield."

Comment 93

When you speak with love and with awe, the <i>Shechinah</i>  herself yearns to listen to your words, like a mother yearning for her child to speak some intelligible words and make her husband proud. So too, when your powerful words ascends on high and are adorned, this power gives rise to intense wonder, and all the angels ask: (I Chronicles 27:21) "Who is like Your people Israel, one nation." It is crucial, therefore, to speak at least one word of prayer with love and with awe, because this is enough to arouse the angels to sing to the Holy One, and you arouse all the worlds when you are devoted to the Holy One - all the worlds become devoted to the Holy One too.

Comment 94

"God heard my voice from God's temple" (Psalms 18:7) - The word 'temple', <i>heichal</i>, applies to Speech. You need to pray only in order to bring the divine quality of Speech before the Holy One. When you pray in this way, all the guards leave you alone. For example, if a simple villager carries the king's signet ring, even if he is usually unworthy of coming before the king, all the royal guards leave him alone, since the king longs for this ring. Instead, they rush him towards the king, so that the king has pleasure sooner. So too, the Holy One longs for Speech, and this then is the meaning of "God heard my voice from God's temple-" because of the longing for Speech.

Comment 95

I heard from my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov, speaking about the morning prayers: that it should be similar to the description in the first chapter of the <i>Tur </i>, that "I should awaken the dawn, rather than the dawn wakening me." You should work hard and strain yourself progressively until reaching the prayer <i>Baruch She'amar</i>, which is analogous to the World of Action, the lower world and the abode of <i>kelippot</i>. Afterwards, you should find more attunement as you progress from <i>Baruch She'amar</i> to <i>Yishtabach</i>, which is analogous to the World of Formation, filled with less <i>kelippot</i> than before. From <i>Yishtabach</i> up to the <i>Amida</i>, have even stronger attunement -- until coming to the <i>Amida</i> itself, which is true and intense embrace and conjoining -- at this point, cast off the garments of corporeality. (See Orach Chayim 98:1) In this way, you begin with <i>Mayim Nukvin</i>, the feminine waters that arouse the <i>Mayim Duchrin</i> and give birth to a male child. This does not happen, however, when one comes to arousal alone (God forbid!), which is a sign of trouble, as hinted at in the verse (Psalms 109:7): "His prayer becomes a sin." The way to rectify this is to pray as described above, and tremble greatly, and pray from the depths of the heart, and so on. 

Comment 96

When you begin to pray, as soon as you utter the words "<i>Adonai Sefatai Tiftach</i>, God, open my lips" - in this moment the Shechina adorns you and speaks through you. If you truly trust that it is the Shechina speaking these words, surely great dread and fear will fall upon you. Even the Holy One, in a way, constricts God's being and dwells with you. This is as it says (Song of Songs 2:9) "Peeking through the lattice," - these are the letters, which are chambers, and you journey from one chamber to the other, and in each chamber you are judged whether you are worthy to enter. If you would notice that you are being judged at every instance when a foreign thought enters your mind, you would certainly pray with fierce attunement. But sometime you forget that you are being judged.

Comment 97

The Baal Shem Tov, peace be upon him, remarked on what is written in the Zohar (1:234a), that you are judged in each and every chamber, and banished from that chamber. This can be understood, since words are also called 'chambers', and when the mind dwells in them, and, when praying, you journey from letter to letter and from word to word - when you are unworthy you are banished. This comes in the form of a foreign thought, and at that point - you are already on the outside. 

Comment 98

When a foreign thought falls into your mind, you should fill with shame, since you have been banished from the royal chamber. You can return to the chamber meekly and ashamed, since entertaining a foreign thought is as great a transgression as giving birth to a bastard child. We find this in the Talmud (Ketubot 63a), that "a sheep follows a sheep." Just as Thought has masculine and feminine aspects, so too are Voice and Speech masculine and feminine. If you entertain a foreign thought and speak words of holiness - this is like creating a mongrel with the outer appearance of a respectable human and an evil interior. So too, when your speech follows holy letters but the thought is misaligned, thinking about something else, a mongrel is created from the holy speech. Imagine the Holy One saying to you: Why are you entering this word? I am not present in this word - since your thoughts are wandering to different places.

Comment 99

If you pray while holding another thought in mind, it is as if - God forbid! - the <i>klippot</i>, the rough husks of reality are riding along on your words. Because Thought rides on Speech, and this is the meaning of (Song of Songs 1:9) "To a horse in Pharaoh's chariots -" speech is likened to horses, and when Pharaoh (that is, the foreign thought) rides upon them, then "I have likened you, my beloved." It would be far better to be silent. Yet what comes from the heart enters the heart, to the supernal heart by means of breath, as is well known. 

Comment 100

The essence of unification is not to separate the mind from speech, and not to mix evil into the good. This is the meaning of (Genesis 2:9) "The tree of knowledge of good and evil," and (Proverbs 30:23) "A slave-girl who supplants her mistress -" all hinting at the upper waters.

Comment 101

In prayer, you need to be as if stripped of materiality and not feel your existence in the world at all. This is the teaching (Avot 1:14) "If I am not for myself, who is for me?" meaning, if I arrive at the state where I do not know and do not feel all that 'I am me', or whether I am in this world or not, then I certainly have no fear of foreign thoughts. For what foreign thought could come close to me when I am stripped of this world, and this is 'who is for me', what kind of foreign thought will come to me. But 'when I am for myself,' when I think of myself as something existent in the reality of this world, then I am considered all the more worthless; that is the meaning of 'what am I', what am I worth and what is my devotion worth before God. Then foreign thoughts will confound me, and then I will be as if not in this world, for the purpose of mankind's creation in this world was to serve God, and I cannot serve God on account of these confusing foreign thoughts. In this way, we can also understand the Talmudic statement (Sukkah 53a) "If I am here, everything is here."

Comment 102

When Jews pray and cleave to the Holy One, a voice calls out (Song of Songs 3:11) "Go forth and gaze, daughters of Zion!" Whoever is unworthy of such unification should get away - this is 'go forth'. And anyone who is worthy and open to it will see - this is 'and gaze'. When the <i>kelippot</i>, the husks of darkness, hear this voice they try to interrupt you in your prayer with foreign thoughts of temporal delights. The wise one, though, cleaves to their love and awe of the Holy Creator, and elevates the living sparks in such thought, and says in their heart: What do I get from cleaving to such materiality? better that I should cleave to its vitality, which is a manifestation of one of God's divine energies, namely, wisdom, as it says (Psalms 104:24) "You formed everything in wisdom."

Comment 103

I heard from my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, the meaning of the verse (Psalms 10:17) "Prepare their heart, incline Your ear." This is a sign given to mankind, that if you can prepare your heart to pray before the Holy One, without any foreign thoughts at all, with all the love and awe you can muster, then you can be sure that the prayer has been accepted. This is the meaning then of "Prepare their heart, incline Your ear," for while you pray you can know that it is being received and heard by God's ears. And the words of the wise are wonderful!

Comment 104

I heard from the holy mouth of the pious and heavenly teacher, the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, who warned about zeal and care in the matter of prayer for people like us, that we might be saved from foreign thoughts. He said a parable in the name of his brother-in-law, the pious Rabbi Gershon of Kitov of blessed memory: there are people who can't feel in their prayers whether they had foreign thoughts or not. For example, there was one road that was very dangerous, and when somebody had to traverse a forest that was full of hidden bandits and thieves waiting for travellers, they would rise from their hiding places and beat, harass and rob him, leaving him covered with wounds and bruises. Anybody who had to go through this forest would go as fast as they possibly could, not giving the bandits time to come out of their hiding places. One time, two men were going though the forest together. One was extremely drunk, and the other was in a normal state of mind. As they went through the forest, the one with the sound mind went as fast as possible until he passed the forest unharmed. His drunken friend went slowly, step by step, and the murderous bandits attacked him and left him bruised and wounded, but he didn't feel a thing because of his drunkenness, until the bandits started attacking each other. The first friend found him and asked how he had survived such a beating, and the second  wondered at his friend's wonder, and said that he had no idea what he was talking about. For he felt he had gone without being harmed, until his friend showed him his wounds and bruises in a mirror, and showed him the bloodstains on all his garments. He was still shocked. The meaning of this parable is apparent. 

Comment 105

The Holy Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory said that if you encounter foreign thoughts during prayer, actually this is a good sign! This is like the following parable: before a human king there are many barriers and guards at every entrance, that nobody can come close to him. Sometimes, someone wants to approach the king with a request, and the guards know that they will suffer from it themselves. If this person is lowly and worthless, they know that the request will be rejected because the king won't take notice of it at all. As soon as such a person asks the guards to pass, they open up the gates, for what do they care for such a person. If, however, the person is an important minister then they try their best to get rid of him, saying 'go and return', for they do not want the minister to come before the king and be accepted, knowing that they will suffer from the request themselves. So too in prayer. It is well known that through communion you can raise holy sparks even from the evil side and from all lowly things. This is their suffering, and therefore, if a lowly person comes before the Holy Blessed One, and whose prayer is in any case improper and unimpressive, the foreign thoughts leave such a person alone and don't confound them. If, however, a godfearing person comes, whose prayer has roots above and fruits below, then the evil side uses all its strength to confound such a person with foreign thoughts. The wise one who understands this gathers all their own strength to overcome them, and cries out in a bitterness "Father! Save me!" The Holy One who yearns for the prayer of Israel throws open all the gates and barriers and puts in place all that is needed in order to raise up these divine sparks, and miracles abound.

Comment 106

In the name of the Baal Shem Tov it was taught that if a foreign thought falls into your mind, consider that it, like everything, is constructed of letters and that the letters are holy. It is just that they were badly reconfigured in the mind and became idiocy. Therefore, if you can transform these letters into holy words, this would indeed be very good - whether by reading the words of the foreign thought backwards, or by splitting the words into two, or by reading the initials of the thought. But all this is only as long as you don't interrupt your attunement in prayer.

Comment 107

Each person has within them potential powers. In one realm they need to use one power, and in a different realm another. As your soul ascends through the various worlds that it needs to pass through, it is tested: if it is unworthy of ascending to such a world, it is cast out. Sometimes, a foreign thought is sent to you in order to cast you out. If you are wise, however, with this very thought you might be able to connect to the Holy One. This is because thought is composed of letters, which themselves are organs of the <i>Shechina</i>, the Divine Presence. Yet these letters descended from their proper place on account of the force of the shattering, and their configuration is wrong. Just like some foods, even though each on their own is good, when they are mixed together they taste terrible - so too these letters, mixed as they are, are terrible.
Understand the essence of the thought - if it's a desire, it comes from the World of Desire; a fear comes from the World of Awe; pride comes from the World of Splendour; and so too with all the others. All these fell from the seven days of construction - and when you reconnect them to the Holy One through love of the Creator and awe of the Creator, you bring them back to their source. So too with all dispositions - each thought fell from a certain quality and can be reconnected to that quality. Then, the husks fall off and the configuration is restored. This is the meaning of the Talmudic passage (Shabbat 153a) "One unties the knots and the sacks fall on their own -" the 'sacks' are the unwanted husks.
The Holy One rejoices in such things, just like a prince who falls into captivity - when he is finally brought before the king, the king rejoices even more than with the child who is always close to him.

Comment 108

In the name of the Baal Shem Tov: when a foreign thought comes to you, during prayer or study - smash that thought and cleave to the Blessed Creator. Doing this will rectify the holy spark that was residing within this thought. This is  like a man who was counting his money, while his son had been kidnapped, and the son calls out to his father: you have the coins! Redeem me from captivity!

Comment 109

If you are engaged in Torah study and in prayer without awe and without love, you will not soar upwards (Tikkunei Hazohar 10). This is especially so if you entertain foreign thoughts, which are called 'unfit sacrifices' that have been given over to the external forces. When you realign yourself, however, you can raise up these sacred sparks that had been with the external forces. Therefore, whenever you begin to pray or to study Torah, the foreign thoughts are poised to confuse your prayer and study. These foreign thoughts are actually your sins, they stand before you as if prepared for warfare, but truly they wish to be repaired and elevated from their heavy husks. This can be done by opening up in awe, and feeling that they are remnants of sins, and regret them. All these explanations I learned from my Master, but I can not expound any more here. 

Comment 110

I heard from my master an explanation of the alphabet, how each letter demands submission and distinction and sweetening. He wanted to say that regarding the harsh judgements known as <i>'Shach v'Par'</i> hinted at in the word <i>Adonai</i> that opens up the prayer, these can all be found and sweetened there, since the first letter is <i>Alef</i>, which holds the secret of wonder ['<i>Pele</i>', the same letters as <i>Alef</i>], and this is hidden in the next letter,<i>Bet</i>, which is simply two times <i>Alef</i>. The next letter <i>Gimmel</i> is three times <i>Alef</i>, and so on until <i>Tav</i>, which is four hundred times<i>Alef</i>. The further the letter is from the life-source, the more it is concealed by layers known as <i>klippot</i>, until the level called <i>Malchut shebaMalchut</i>, the source of evil thoughts. When you focus your thoughts on this exile of the <i>Shechina</i>, whose spark is concealed in these ugly layers of <i>klippot</i>, you will be filled with dread. At that moment all the evil forces will leave, and a mighty act of unification through awe will have been accomplished. The holy spark will be distinguished from the rest,and be able to rise and join its life-source, in the manner of (Ezekiel 1:14) "the living-angels run to and fro". This is freedom from exile, and submission of the self, for it is as if not you are speaking but the <i>Shechina</i> herself. This is distinction, in that the <i>klippot</i> are cast off, and a sweetening, in that the words rise and are sweetened at their divine roots. How beautiful are the words of the wise!

Comment 111

The words <i>Alufeinu mesubalim</i> (Psalms 144:14), can be interpreted so: when you know that the Master (<i>Aluf</i>) of the Universe is in every action, then you are able to bear (<i>lisbol</i>) everything, and nothing is able to breach this. Moreover, as I heard from my Teacher, that when you comprehend that the presence of the Holy One fills the entire world, and that every action and thought is divine - even if it seems that some words of our prayers say otherwise - even so, "all evildoers shall be scattered." (Psalms 92:10) I also heard this: you need to possess the qualities of submission, distinction and sweetening, which reflect the ancient shattering, by which divine sparks fell within the <i>klippot</i>, the harshness of the world. You need to be able to separate improper thoughts from within the <i>Shechina</i>, the divine presence. Truly, the words of the wise are beautiful! The wise will discern here that there are two aspects, one general and one particular. I have written more about this elsewhere, commenting on the Talmudic passage (Ketubot 16b): "How does one dance before the bride? Beit Shammai say that one praises her as she truly is, while Beit Hillel say that one always calls her a beautiful and modest bride." Beit Shammai hold that during this era of exile, it is enough to treat her [the <i>Shechina</i>] in general as she truly is; Beit Hillel hold a particular method, that she needs to be adorned until she is beautiful and modest, etc. Truly, the words of the wise are beautiful! So too, if you are able to purify your thoughts, how good and wonderful it is to be particular and to use these qualities of submission, distinction and sweetening, since these are very profound. And if not, you should accept that in general, everything is from the Blessed God, and you will be able to stand firm; the <i>klippot</i> will be unable to harm you at any level, since you cleave to God firmly. This is God's promise (Zachariah 3:7) "I will permit you to move about among these standing attendants" - these are the angels, and the external forces will be unable to move you from your firm position. 

Comment 112

I heard this from my Master of blessed memory, regarding the Talmudic teaching (Ketubot 16b): "How does one dance before the bride? Beit Shammai say to praise her as she truly is, while Beit Hillel say to call her a beautiful and modest bride." He explained this as follows: in the future, the <i>Shechina</i> will be called  a bride, which is not the case now, when she is referred to as <i>zot</i>, 'that'. Now you can understand how we dance at this time, in the era of exile of the <i>Shechina</i>, before she is referred to as a bride. 'Dancing' is the raising of holy sparks from the lowest levels to higher ones, like a sacred dance. This is difficult to do properly during exile, as the Holy Ari of blessed memory taught regarding the prayers of <i>Nefilat Apayim</i>, the essence of which is to raise sparks from the world of action upwards. His disciple, R. Hayim Vital, commented that none of us know, etc. Therefore, Beit Shammai said that one praises the bride as she is, as it is written (Zohar 1:103b) on the verse 'The groom is known within the gates' - that each one can know God according to their own comprehension and ability. This can be done generally, if you can't do it in detail by adorning the <i>Shechina</i> and unifying her - in any case, you can comprehend the bride as she is. Beit Hillel, however, said that the bride is beautiful and modest - that you need to know in detail how to remove the garments of filth and excrement, and dress her in detail, so that the bride is beautiful and modest. Truly, the words of the wise are beautiful! 

Comment 113

I've written elsewhere in the name of my Master of blessed memory the explanation for the argument (Ketubot 16b) between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, regarding how to dance before a bride. Beit Shammai hold that the bride is praised as she actually is, in general terms - you should know that the presence of the divine is concealed everywhere, etc. Beit Hillel, however, hold that every bride should be called beautiful and modest - you should know every detail, how the light of the divine sparks fell into the husks, and how, during prayer, when base thoughts arrive, they should be separated from their husks and the divine sparks should be elevated to adorn the bride, so that she be beautiful and modest. 

Comment 114

It is upon you to know and to believe that the presence of God fills the universe, and every action and thought all derive from God. "Then all evildoers will scatter" (Psalms 92:10). This is the meaning of the verse (I Chronicles 28:9) "Know the God of your father" - which my Master explained in a similar way.

Comment 115

I heard from my Master of blessed memory about foreign thoughts and how to enter their essence and repair them, removing the outer parts. If you do not know the details, at least know the general principle, that in each and every thing there is a unification of the two names <i>h v y h</i> and <i>a d n y</i>, etc. Truly, the words of the wise are beautiful! I also heard on these matters the secret of the spear, etc. [See Baal Shem Tov on Parashat Balak]

Comment 116



Comment 117

The Baal Shem Tov, may his soul rest in supernal gardens, explained the Talmudic passage (Berachot 34a), that one who does not have <i>kavvanah</i> in prayer should be 'beaten with a blacksmith's hammer' - this is the death of the soul.

Comment 118

In the books, we find a tradition in the name of the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, regarding that which was said by the sages of blessed memory (Berachot 34a) "One who repeats the Shema etc. ... if they have such absence of any intention, they are beaten with a blacksmith's hammer." See what was written there in his holy name. And the root of the matter is such: that the foreign thoughts that fall into your mind during your prayer, or during your study, they are actually the holy sparks that you yourself let fall into the outer husks, the <i>kelippot</i>. This was done either in this lifetime or in an earlier incarnation, or even by the sin of Adam, in whom all the souls of Israel were included. This is why each person has the duty to repair the sparks that arrive to them. Therefore, when you stand in prayer and want to cleave to holiness, then these specific sparks come to you too, in order to be repaired, etc. I myself heard his holy mouth phrase it in this way: You need to be very sneaky with the foreign thoughts that come to you during prayer, because they are your own forces coming back to you to be repaired.

Comment 119

I heard from my teacher an explanation of the verse (Psalms 109:7-11) "Let his prayer be considered a sin... may his children be orphaned and his wife widowed... let the creditor take all he has." He explained this in light of the Talmudic statement (Kiddushin 40b) "Great is study, since it leads to action." It can be countered that this implies that action is greater than study etc., but he explained that study has both aspects within it, in the way that the rabbis said (Menachot 110a), "All who study the laws of the <i>olah</i> sacrifice, it is as if they offered an actual <i>olah</i>." If so, both study and action are included in study, which is not the case with action on its own. Now, since the soul (<i>nefesh</i>) is a garment for the spirit (<i>ruach</i>), and <i>ruach</i> is a garment for the <i>neshamah</i>-soul, if so, <i>nefesh</i> is considered the 'wife' of <i>ruach</i>, which in turn is the 'wife' of <i>neshamah</i>. Similarly, the sages taught (Megillah 6b) that the wicked devours one who is more righteous than he, and so too, King David of blessed memory said of Do'eg and Ahitofel who at least taught him some Torah, which is considered feminine waters with regards to prayer. The Maharsha wrote that all Torah is preparation for the awe that we call prayer, and in prayer you receive masculine waters. When you study for its own sake, the feminine waters arrive just like the masculine waters. This is not so when you study for an ulterior motive, and you receive a similar kind of [impure] inspiration, and then is your prayer considered a sin, since your prayer is confused by foreign thoughts. So too, your soul, your <i>nefesh</i> is a widow, since it is no longer connected like a 'wife' to the spirit, <i>ruach</i>, giving feminine waters. And your children, which are your good actions, are orphaned, since Torah study is considered action, as we explained, ans since it is not done for its own sake, these actions are scattered about and do not rise upwards, and are therefore orphans. "The creditor will take all he has," because the evil inclination lends you some mitzvah that you can do in order to show off and glorify yourself, or you will teach some Torah which is also called 'an act of glory', leading to masculine waters flowing down. Much harm and sorrow is in store, for the evil inclination then comes to take back what he lent, and then "takes all he has" - may the Merciful One protect us! Wonderful are the words of the wise.

Comment 120

In the works of the Ari, may he be remembered in the coming world, he explains that the prayer of this day is not like the prayer of tomorrow, until the coming of the Messiah. This is the meaning of the mishna (Berachot 28b): "One who makes their prayer regular, it is not considered a supplication." Now, I heard in the name of my master a wonderful teaching about this about the foreign thoughts that come to you in the middle of your prayer, reflecting the mystery of the breaking of the vessels, and the 288 sparks that one is required to discern each day. They come to you in order that you repair and elevate them. And the foreign thoughts of today are not like the foreign thoughts of tomorrow, and this is clear to one who pays attention to them. This is what I learned from my master on the matter of repairing foreign thoughts: if they are thoughts of sexuality, one can elevate them and bring them to their root of <i>hesed</i>, which is the secret of the verse (Leviticus 20:17) "If a man takes his sister... this is <i>hesed</i>." Thoughts of idolatry are rooted in a flaw in <i>tiferet</i>. But this is enough on this subject.

Comment 121

Within prayer, there are gifts and there are battles. You need to battle against the foreign thoughts until each one can be bound to its root. This is what my master taught on the matter of the three pillars, etc. Afterwards, you will receive it as a gift - this is what used to be a foreign thought, now attached by its holy root to our Heavenly Father.

Comment 122

Even if foreign thoughts arrive, my master taught me how to discern whether a thought is from the pillar of kindness, <i>hesed</i>, that fell through the breaking of the vessels and needs to be elevated. Some thoughts, however, are thoughts of transgression, and when such a thought arrives, you should know that there is judgement against you that want you to be punished, and you should tremble greatly at this understanding. By doing so, you can unite Awe and Awed, and "all evildoers will disappear." In this way he interpreted the verses "I know that you are a beautiful woman" (Genesis 12:11) and "Lest they kill me" (Genesis 26:7) - a hint at the punishment of one who harbours this type of thoughts of sexuality.

“And it came to pass, at the end of two years . . .” (Genesis 41:1) “He makes an end to darkness” (Job 28:3). A limit was set as to how long the world will remain in darkness. For as long as the evil inclination is in the world, there is darkness and distress; when the evil inclination is removed from the world, there will be no more darkness and distress. (Midrash Rabbah, Miketz 89:1) <br> The mystical writings of the Arizal explain the concept of the extraction of the holy sparks, that fell in the time of the breakage [of the vessels], and how a person must raise these sparks from the level of mineral to vegetable, animal and speaker. Extracting these sparks of holiness from among the “shells” is the purpose of all a Jew's actions, in Torah study, fulfillment of the commandments, and in the mystical intentions of eating.
Each spark found within these lower levels of existence has a complete form, with 248 [spiritual] organs and 365 sinews. However, as long as it is on that level, it is imprisoned, with its head on its knees and belly, unable to extend its hands and feet. A person, with the goodness of his thoughts and intentions, can uplift the spark of holiness from the [level of a] plant to [that of a] speaking being. He brings them out to freedom. This is the greatest fulfillment of the mitzvah of redeeming captives. And since it is the king’s son himself who is in captivity, a person works to free him from his imprisonment will certainly receive abundant reward. Nevertheless, everything follows the supernal judgment that puts a limit to darkness, and has determined just how long something will remain imprisoned, when it will deserve to exit, and through whom it will attain freedom.<br>(Ben Porat Yosef, p. 74b)

I heard from my master an explanation of the Talmud (Berakhot 35b): Many did like Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, and they did not succeed, etc. And that idea is that there are two types of people — there is one who behaves according to nature, he plows at plowing time, he harvests at harvest time, etc.; the second one acts above nature to trust God, that He will bring sufficient sustenance from his few business dealings, such that he can devote himself to being occupied in the service of God, may He be blessed, all of his days. And then his work will be done by others. And this is [the idea of] <i>But the righteous person shall live by his faith</i> (Habakkuk 2:4) that they expounded in Makkot (24a:27), "Habakkuk came and established [all of the commandments] upon one [statement], etc." This is not the case with one is not on the level of trust, but wants to act like R. Shimon ben Yochai. For he leaves his level of nature but has not reached the elevated level. So he ends up shorn here and shorn there. And this is the meaning of what they said, "Many did like R. Shimon ben Yochai," even those who are not in this category; hence "they did not succeed." And the words from the mouth of a sage are graceful [hidden wisdom]. And this is with my own expansion to explain it. Although I also heard that it was because many did like R. Shimon ben Yochai, that is why they did not succeed. And the words from the mouth of a sage are graceful [hidden wisdom]. (Toledot Yaakov Yitzchak, Parashat Miketz 35b)

Issachar is a strong-boned ass, crouching down between the stables (Gen. 49:14). In the name of Rabbi Israel Ba’al Shem, on the verse Issachar is a strong-boned [garem] donkey: that is to say, there is reward [s’khar] by way of that which the “donkey” causes [gorem]. (Tzava'at HaRivash p.12b)

Comment 4

In the name of the Ba’al Shem Tov, this is the explanation: “There is reward that the ‘donkey’ [hamor] causes,” meaning by way of food and drink, which are physical [homer] matters, he causes this reward – by way of his elevating to the Cause of Elevation the holy spark that was crouching down between the stables, which was among the lower elements. (Or HaGanuz le-Tzadikim, Vayehi)

Comment 5

It is stated in the Talmud: “The Torah has mercy on Israel’s money” (Rosh HaShanah 27a), and why so? Because this is an important principle, that whatever thing a person wears, or eats, or uses as a tool – he benefits from the life-force that is within that thing; for without the spirituality that thing would have no existence, and there [in the thing] are holy sparks relevant to the root of his soul. And I heard that for this reason there is a person who loves a certain thing, and there is a person who hates that thing and loves another thing; and when he uses that tool, or eats foods even for his body’s needs, he fixes the sparks. For afterward he serves [God], with that same power that comes to his body from that food or clothing or other things, with that power he serves Blessed God, and we find that through this [the sparks] are fixed. Therefore sometimes it happens that when he has already finished fixing all the sparks that were in that thing, which were related to the root of his soul, then Blessed God takes that tool from him and gives it to someone else, since the sparks that [remain] in that tool are relevant to a different root.
And Rabbi Israel Ba’al Shem, peace be upon him, said that people eat and people drink and people use [tools], meaning the sparks that are in those things; therefore a person must be sensitive about his tools and everything else that he has, meaning from the side of the sparks that are within them, in order to have mercy on the holy sparks.

And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face.

I heard from my teacher (the Baal Shem Tov) regarding the verse "behold, darkness will cover the land etc" (Isaiah 60:2) and on the verse "love covers all sins" (Prov. 10:12) that the base is the center and the root of all construction. If the base is unstable and weak the building will fall. So too a person whose base is unstable and weak, such as when a person has arrogance, then all that person's good deeds are built on a basis that is weak and unstable. This is not the case with a strong base, that is able to deal lovingly with hatred and sin, covering them. And those are words of a wise mouth. (Tzfonat Paneach, Terumah, 5:36)

I heard from the holy mouth of the late rabbi, pious man and outstanding preacher, our teacher Rabbi Yehudah Leib Polnoyer, when he gave a reason for the [sages'] statement, may their memory be blessed, when they said (Arakhin 15b), "Three are struck by the iniquity of evil speech: The person who speaks evil speech, the person who accepts it, and the person who they are speaking about." As all of [our] predecessors had difficulty with this: What did this one who they are speaking evil speech about do [wrong], that he should be struck with them? And the pious rabbi, may his memory be blessed, said — and it appears to me that he said it in the name of the Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be blessed — that it is from the causes of the matter that bring a certain person to speak evil speech about his fellow. Behold, the one that causes this thing is the person himself who they are speaking about. It is like what the sages, may their memory be blessed, said about the verse: <i>For He pays a man according to his actions</i> (Job 34:11). That it means to say, that the sin itself which a person sinned is that which afflicts him. And that means that through the sin that one sinned, a husk [<i>klipah</i>] is then created, and that husk itself is what afflicts him with afflictions according to the measure of the sin that he sinned. And it is also like that with this thing. For is it not known that something is created for every word a man puts out of his mouth?  If the word is one of holiness, something holy will be created from it. And also the opposite, if the word has a transgression in it, some husk is created from it. However, there are types of words that are not from this side nor that side, like words that a person speaks that are not needed at all, not for the body and not for the soul, or if he speaks words that are a little self-serving. Also from them is something created. However, this creation does not have its own power to afflict him, so it clings to a wicked person. And then that man to whom it clings, he speaks evil speech from that power about that very person from whose speech that power was created. And that is why it is good for him also to be struck; to rectify those words. (Divrei Moshe, Parashat Mishpatim)

<b>And you shall love your neighbor like yourself, [I am the Lord]:</b> The explantion of the verse, "and you shall love your neighbor," is [that] just like you act towards your neighbor with love and unity - "like yourself, I am the Lord"; that I the Lord will be like yourself. And this is according to the secret of, "the Lord is your shadow" (Psalms 121:5), that is explained in the words of our Godly teacher, the Baal Shem Tov: That like a person behaves below with his friend and neighbor, with love and with proper traits, so too will the supernal King behave towards him. And it is like a shadow - that every movement that a a person makes, the shadow corresponds to it. So too is He, may He be blessed, with man. And that is [the meaning of], "and you shall love your neighbor" - that like yourself, I am the Lord," to also act towards you with love and all goodness.

In the name of the Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be a blessing for the world to come: He was troubled; what is the reason that we only mention the merit of the three forefathers, who are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and why we do not mention the merit of Reuben, the merit of Simon, etc.; the merit of Chanoch and Palu, even though they were also greatly righteous people? Another difficulty is that we find in the holy Zohar, a few teachers whose souls would come to study the secrets of the Torah after they died with Rabbi Shimon Ben Yochai and his colleagues — for example, the elder Rav Hamnuna and his son, etc. Yet we do not see that [other] teachers came back once they died, neither them nor their souls! The Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be a blessing for the world to come, explained like this. That a righteous person whose service and prayer was always for the generation continues with his traits even after his death. So he comes to rectify the generation by way of teaching them Torah, etc. And it is like they, may their memory be blessed, said in the holy Zohar (Tikkunei HaZohar 69), "Our teacher Moses, peace be upon him, extended over several generations, etc.," for every sage and righteous person. It is because, just like while he was alive, he gave over his life for the sake of all of the Jewish people — like the statement:<i> if You will forgive their sin [well and good]; but if not, etc.</i> (Exodus 32:32 in Parashat Ki Tissa) — so too, after his death, did he come to rectify each sage and righteous person. So the whole generation is rectified through him. Likewise with the forefathers whose actions and service was to rectify all the generations, as per our rabbis' statement, may their memory be blessed, "Were it not that the forefathers consumed and received their reward in this world, etc." (Bemidbar Rabbah, Bechukotai 30:3). That is why their merit is mentioned for all of the generations, which is not the case with righteous people whose actions and service were only to rectify themselves. That is why their merit is not mentioned, and their souls also do not come to study Torah with the other righteous people in order to rectify the generation.

“…lest your heart grow haughty and you forget the LORD your God…” (Devarim 8:14) They said in the gemara (Sotah 5a) This is a warning to the proud in spirit, as it is written ‘lest your heart grow haughty and you forget.’ The Rav Moshe m’Kotzi counted this as a negative commandment and wrote that God revealed to him in a dream, that the essential warning of all the Torah is the commandment to remember and that forgetting, which is its opposite, God forbid destroys the whole Torah. And the Holy Ba’al Shem Tov explained  - when the blood is clouded, then one is in the aspect of the ‘back end’ which has the numeric value of ‘and you forget’ because memory flows from the names of zachor and forgetting from the ‘back end’ of Aba and Ima which is the numeric value of ‘and you forget’ as is written in the Yichudim (Sha'ar Ruach ha-kodesh, tikun 26 (daf 17, column 3)). As it is with an individual, so it is with humanity – exile flows from forgetting and redemption from remembering. “The words of a wise man’s mouth find favor…” (Kohelet 10:12)

Traducción al Español: Por Jaim Yoel ben Avraham
"Y ahora, Israel, ¿qué pide el Señor tu Dios de ti, sino que temas al Señor tu Dios...? Y se dice en el Talmud (Berajot 43b): ¿Acaso el temor de los cielos es un asunto pequeño...? Para Moisés no es un asunto pequeño... Escuché de mi maestro una explicación del Talmud... y la dificultad es conocida: pues a Israel se le dijo esto... Y explicó que el Rashba escribió que 'temer al Señor tu Dios' incluye a los sabios (Baba Kama 82b), porque un ignorante no teme el pecado, y al ser un sabio llega al temor de Dios... Y he aquí que en Moisés encontramos (en la porción de 'Tetzaveh') 'y el pueblo temía acercarse a él'. Si ya habían alcanzado el temor de un sabio, entonces fácilmente podrían llegar al temor de Dios. Y esto es lo que se dijo: 'Para Moisés no es un asunto pequeño', es decir, ya que habían alcanzado el temor de un sabio, que es en relación a Moisés, como se dice 'y el pueblo temía acercarse a él', entonces es un asunto pequeño llegar también al temor de Dios, ya que esto se deriva de aquello. Y una dificultad adicional..." (Tikkunei Zohar, hoja 73).

And the explanation is that the rich one who gives <i>tzedakah</i>, they are the one who fulfils the commandment of 'you shall surely give to them... you shall surely open up your hand to your kin... ' (Devarim 15:7-8). But the poor one who receives it, it seems that this one does not do any mitzvah. However, this is specifically in the case that the poor person who receives the tzedakah receives it with this intent: 'Since I need to receive, such as if my wages are not enough to live on', for regarding this it is said (Talmud Yerushalmi Peah 37b): "All who need to take alms and do not take, they are a shedder of blood", and in Mishna Peah 8:8 "If one had 199 <i>dinarim</i>, even if a thousand gave to one at once, behold one should take". If so, when the poor person receives with this intent: 'Since I need to receive, behold, I am causing the rich who do <i>tzedakah</i> with me to merit!', it turns out that the deed is greater than the doer (Bava Batra 9a). For behold, the poor person who receives, they can on one day receive <i>tzedakah</i> from many people, more than the giver can give to. And this was said explicitly by our rabbis regarding the verse (Ruth 2:19) - "The man with whom I worked today is Boaz". 'The man who worked with me' is not said, rather, 'the man with whom I worked', since more than the homeowner does with the poor, the poor does with the homeowner. And behold the poor person who receives <i>tzedakah</i> for the sake of Heaven, it's fitting for them that they only receive from righteous donors, that they will merit by the poor person's hand. But not from wicked donors, as we find with Elisha, that from righteous men he received <i>tzedakah</i>, but from Na'aman he did not want to take - and this is even though Na'aman converted and became a resident alien (Gittin 57b), he still didn't want to receive from him since he was not worthy to receive merit by Elisha's hand. And this is the the explanation of the Gemara: the one who wishes to benefit should benefit like Elisha, meaning, that they should intend in their taking of <i>tzedakah</i> to merit the rich who give to them, and if so they should only receive from righteous Jews who are worthy to receive merit by their hand. And one should not say, 'since it's a <i>mitzvah</i> to receive <i>tzedakah</i>, by this path, if so I should chase after any taking!' Regarding this it is said that even though this is permissible, the one who does not wish to benefit should not benefit, like Shmuel the Ramatite [?] who did not benefit from other creatures.

<b>When it happens that you come to the land, etc. You are to take of the first of all the fruits of the ground, etc.:</b> The words of our Godly teacher: The secret of the first fruits is the return of the lights of the feminine (<i>nukva</i>, another characterization of <i>malkhut</i>) to the priest, who is kindness (<i>chesed</i>), in order that the external forces not derive sustenance from it. And the explanation of the words of our teacher refer to that which we have learned (Ketuvot 105b) - "anyone who brings a gift to a Torah scholar is as if he offered first fruits": Why are specifically first fruits differentiated [here] from all [other] gifts to the priesthood. And the clarification of this matter is that it is because 'The Lord has made every thing for His purpose' - as He created everything for His glory, to extract the sparks of purity that have been scattered into all things. And the community of Israel is elevated with all of the extractions, and it becomes 'a new offering to the Lord.' This is like the explanation of the '<i>kav</i> (a measurement, whose numerical equivalent has kabbalistic significance) of the new and <i>kav</i> of the old,' that is known to those that know. And a man that clings to his God makes a unification of His name with everything that he sees, hears, smells and feels; and through this, the Divine Presence (the feminine, <i>malkhut</i>) is 'adorned with adornments that [previously] did not exist' (the language of the holy Zohar, Mishpatim 3:15), 'and all doers of iniquity shall be scattered. So the evil will be sweetened and the good will be purified. And he hints with the lower and makes a tremendous unification in the upper.

Our sages, may their memory be blessed, established that we should blow [the shofar] every year from the first day of Elul, like the shofar of the desert (Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 46). And the understanding of this is that if the heads of the generation improve (<i>meshaper</i>) their deeds, like Moshe in the wilderness, they will then ascend and attach themselves to the people of the generation. But that is not the case if the heads of the generation do not do this, but are rather in the exile of the evil impulse. Then the people should make efforts for themselves. This is like I heard in the name of my master, may his memory be a blessing for life in the world to come, about the prayer leaders - that they are heads of the war party, such that it is fit that they should wear armor, etc.; but if not, each one should make efforts for himself, since they cannot be relied upon, etc. And these are words from the mouth of a sage of [the hidden wisdom]. (Tzafnat Paneach, page 25d)

Master of the Universe, You said to Jonah, "You cared about the plant, which you did not work for and you did not grow, which appeared overnight and perished overnight. And should not I care about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not yet know their right hand from their left, and many beasts as well!” -Why will you not care and show mercy on us, who have the minds of human beings?

To rectify all the disqualified prayers that are imprisoned in the hands of the angels designated over this, and those are the prayers that have external thoughts mixed with them. For the disqualified prayers are given over to the hands of the appointed ones the whole year until a person prays a proper prayer. Then the disqualified prayers arise from the appointed one called Sahadiel to the angel that is called Sandalfon, and he brings it up above. But if one does not pray a proper prayer, then the appointed one waits until [Rosh Hashanah] and Yom Kippur. And when one then prays properly, then the disqualified prayers also arise. But if not, the appointed one hurls them to the disqualified sanctified [offerings], which is outside of the firmament. And that is where the woman of licentious, Lilith, holds sway. So she takes the disqualified prayers and makes a firmament out of them, a worthless firmament. Then she goes up and prosecutes about those prayers, God forbid.
