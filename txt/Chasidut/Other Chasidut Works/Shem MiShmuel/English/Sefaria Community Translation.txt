The summary of these things is that it is all in one pattern: The four decrees, the four expressions of redemption, the four empires and the four holinesses - which are the three forefathers and our teacher, Moshe, peace be upon him; and the three festivals and Shabbat. And the fourth in all of these encompasses the three previous ones.

We should contemplate about the idea of TuBiShevat, why we do not say the supplicational prayers (Tachanun). Is not its being the new year of trees something natural? That most of the year’s rains have fallen, such that the sap has risen in the trees; and from then on, the fruits emerge! If so, what is the idea of not saying the supplicational prayers on it? For it has no holiness and no commandment; no miracle happened on it, nor anything [else] that relates to the Jewish people. About the 15th of Av, [the Sages,] may their memory be blessed, spoke at the end of Taanit in the Talmud about some of the reasons [for it], that there were things that occurred on it that related to the Jewish people. But what is the novelty of Tu BiShevat? And it appears [to me as follows]: That behold it is written (Isaiah 55:10-11), "For as the rain or snow drops from heaven and returns not there, but soaks the earth and makes it bring forth vegetation, etc. So is the word that issues from My mouth, etc." Behold the prophet compared the word of God to the rains that bring things forth [produce]. So it appears that the idea of a tree is something that connects the fruit to the ground; and it is what is in the middle between the fruit and the ground and has the power of connection. And it appears that it carries a hint in its numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>). <i>Ilan</i> (tree) is 91, the numerical equivalent of the names of the Existence and Lordship of God, to which the Heavens and Earth relate. So it is the connection of the Heavens and the Earth.  And we can learn from the essence of the physical about the spiritual; and this is why man is compared to [a tree], as it is written (Deuteronomy 20:19), "for are the trees of the field human beings." For the form of man is to connect the upper realm and the lower realm, in that he has a soul from the upper realm and a body, which bears the soul, from the lower realm. And [the Sages,] may their memory be blessed, said about the reason for the beheaded calf (being killed in its prime, is that it is symbolic), that he (the man murdered) was not allowed to make fruits. What are fruits [here? The fulfillment of] commandments. For the commandments are comparable to the fruit that grows on trees. As in the fruit, it has the spiritual power to sustain and give life to man. This is as per the explanation of the Ari, may his memory be blessed, to the verse (Deuteronomy 8:3), "not by bread alone does man live, but rather by all that issues from the mouth of the Lord does man live" - meaning by that which issues from the mouth of the Lord that is in the bread. And the body of the fruit is what bears the spirituality that is in it. So too are commandments the 248 limbs of the King. and the body of the commandments are what bears the spirituality in the commandment. And when a person does a commandment - since he has the power to connect the higher realm and the lower realm, it therefore comes out that there is the power in the act of the commandment that he does to connect and attach the higher realm and the lower realm, the act of the commandment from the lower realm and the spirituality in it from the higher realm. This is comparable to a tree that has the power to connect, and issues fruit that connects, as mentioned above. And this is so even though there are fruits of the ground (that grow straight from the ground and not from trees) and they have spirituality and that which issues from the mouth of the Lord in them, and it is nevertheless not made by way of an intermediary. And that is like there is also, among places in the world, the place of the Temple, that was always a connection for the upper realm and the lower realm, as per the Midrash, even without man as an intermediary. However the holiness in the commandments is [always] with man as an intermediary.

The Medrash on the verse :"אדם כי יהי' בעור בשרו"...This can be compared to a matron that entered into the palace of the king.  When she saw the fools who were gathered there, she became frightened of them.  The King said: Don't be afraid these are man and maid servants, but you only need to drink and be happy.  So too, when the Jews heard the laws of leprosy they became frightened, Moses said these laws belong to the nations of the world, but you only have to eat and drink and be merry." The question is famous: The nations of the world never become impure through leprosy! (How then could Moshe have said that the laws of leprosy belong to the nations of the world?) (3) My father answered that the very fact that we separate the METZORA and send him out of the camp is precisely to prevent negative forces any connection to the entire Jewish community who are left completely pure. (4)  However, what is left unclear is why the laws of Metzora are used specifically as a way of siphoning off the impurity of negative forces?  Even those who serve idols, immorality and murder are not sent out of the camp of the Jewish camp, and those with seminal emissions are also not sent out the camp, (but the Metzora is completely cast out!)
(1)It would appear that we see in the Medrash Rabbah at the end of the Torah portion: שאת refers to Babylon, ספחת to Media, בהרת is Greece, and נגע צרעת refers to Rome.   This is difficult to understand, because צרעת is the accumulation of all the other elements, and is not a affliction in and of itself? (Why then is צרעת compared to a new nation of Rome?)  (2)This could be understood by examining the Medrash at the end of Shmini which states that Daniel saw the first three kingdoms on one night and the last kingdom on one night.  Moses devoted 1 verse to the three kingdoms, and 1 verse to the final kingdom.  why is this? Rabbi Yochanan says that the final kingdom is equal to all three of them, and Reish Lakish says that the final kingdom says that the final kingdom excedes the three. (3) The matter is thus: the fourth kingdom being equal or  exceeding the first three is not by chance.
It appears that man has 3 elements to him - his NEFESH, RU'ACH and NESHAMA, or his body, his soul and his intellect, and there is no real difference between these terms.  Philosophers have attempted to understand how the soul which is spiritual can connect to the physical soul.  My teacher of blessed memory stated that there is a fourth force and that is called the 'image of G-d' which connects all three of these elements because it is equivalent to all of them, and the philosophers do not know this.  It would appear that the four names we call man - , ENOSH,GEVER, ISH, ADAM(relate to these 4 elements).  ENOSH is the perspective of the body which is a mortal, weak strength.  GEVER relates to the NEFESH which has in it the capability to overcome the physical desires of the body, and ISH relates to his intellect.  (ISH) has connotations of being on top of all the others like ISH NAOMI.  ISH means the master of the house.  This (gives added depth to what) the Rabbis have explained that the evil inclination.  First it is like a traveller, then a guest in one's house, and then finally ISH (i.e. it becomes the master of the house).  ADAM corresponds to the image of G-d which connects them all, and in Gematriya ADAM = 45 which relates to G-d's holy name.  These words are ancient.
..However it is known that G-d made a balance of these concepts so that the strength of the dark forces (against the 4 levels of greatness of man mentioned previously) whose purpose is to pull against man, and to put him into their power.  These are the three cardinal sins which are the head and source of all the sins.  They are idolatory, immorality and murder. As the Maharal has explained (in Netzach Yisrael). (1)Idolatory stands against the intellect of man.  In contrast to the straight intellect which is planted in the heart of man, a crooked intellect has been created which will  lead to serving idols as were served in the time of Enosh (as expounded in the Rambam, Yesodei Hotorah) that they created the concept of idols in their intellects. (2)Immorality is created against the body.  The body was created to be the 'carrier' of the soul, and to be subservient to its tasks (according to the writings of the Kuzari pt.3). Against it was created the strength which pulls one to be pulled after animal actions (of immorality), and (3) murder is balanced against the spirit, because it was created to rule over both the intellect and the body, and to lead them wherever the spirit is taken to serve G-d.  This is the meaning of "Limshol" to rule over the world and pull it towards G-d.  This is what Man first said "Let us go and bow to G-d.  Against this, was created the force to rule over everything, and to smash under his feet anything which stands against his desires, until he comes to anger, jealousy, and murder.
Against these three things that pull a person

And on the face of it, it is an impossible thing! How could the text say that all of the congregation of Israel should be holy! Holiness is beyond even the greatest among Israel, since not every person can merit to be called holy. And it is a positive commandment for every human. And this is extraordinary: even though every person is what they are, they can still be holy. And it seems that the explanation is that each, according to what The Holy One commands each person, that person needs to separate and comprehend their standing. The holiness of simple people is not appropriate for those who are in a higher standing, and a person who understands what for them is materialism and coarseness and separates themselves from it, that is holiness. But for those in a higher level that is not holiness at all, and a person in that standing needs to separate from other things, constantly - even if for the simple people their separating constantly from their materialism is real and great kedushah. And the general rule is that this is a general mitzvah but for each person it will look like a different mitzvah, as there is a different holiness, as each person needs to make holy their tendencies that their nature gives them.

<b>"And these words will be, which I command you today, on your heart"</b> (Devarim 6:6) And there's what to understand that seemingly the language "<i>in</i> your heart" would be more justified, like it says <b>"In your mouth and in your heart to do it"</b> (Devarim 30:14). And so said the elders of our master, our teacher, our rabbi, the great, the memory of the righteous be for a blessing and the world to come, from Kotzk. He told that the words need to be laid like a stone on the heart. And when the heart opens at special times, they will fall into it (this being the end of his [direct] holy speech). Meaning, the heart at most times is closed and the words don't enter within the heart. And in any case, a person cannot give up, rather they should do their own, and should not pay attention to their feeling that the words are not entering into their heart and are not having any action. Rather, the words should be laid like a stone on the outside of the heart and [a person] should not be concerned, and so, when a time comes that the heart opens, at sacred times and suchlike, then immediately the words will fall into the heart.

<b>The matter</b> of sheva berakhot (seven blessings said in honor of a bride and groom) is that seven is a communal number. And at the time of marriage, one becomes a communal person. This is like [the Sages'] statement, may their memory be blessed (Rosh Hashanah 32b), "Since many will come out (be born) from her, she is like a community." And since the number, sheva berakhot, is relevant to him - meaning, that the communal force which is in Him, may He be blessed, is [now also] within him - this [new status] requires sheva berakhot. 
<b>The reason</b> for the commandment to cause the groom and bride to rejoice is surely that which the Ikkarim (Maamar 3 33:9) wrote - that joy gives permeance to a thing. And by marriage, a person makes it that there will permeance to his line forever. It is like it is written in the [text of the] sheva berakhot, "an everlasting structure." That is why the commandment to make them rejoice appears; in order that there will be everlasting permanence [for them].

And in contemplating the commandment of the first fruits (<i>bikkurim</i>), it can be said that its special property is also that it has the lofty power within it to draw a person to accept the yoke of the kingdom of the Heavens upon himself. Meaning, to negate all seven of the traits of his soul to God, may He be blessed, as mentioned above. And that is since the first fruits is practiced with seven species. And in the Yalkutei Torah from the Ari, may his memory be blessed, [it is said] that the root force of the seven species is in the kingdom of the Heavens, from the seven supernal traits. To here are his words. And even though we do not have any business with the secrets, it can nevertheless be explained on a simple level regarding the first fruits. For a person desires the new fruit, especially if he toiled upon them for a whole year, such that a person 'wants his singular portion.' So 'when a person sees a fig that has come out first, etc.,' and he separates it out for the Heavens, this is symbolic of giving over all of his desires to God, and the seven species hint to the seven traits. And we have already said that this is the matter of the seven commandments that exist in the first fruits, as is written by the Rambam. Hence it can be said that the special property of this commandment for a Jew is to arouse a negation of his seven traits to the will of God, may He be blessed, regarding all things for the whole year. And hence a heavenly voice blesses him, "May you repeat the bringing of the first fruits today next year." And it is implied that the power of this special quality continues for the whole year; and that is the idea of accepting the yoke of the kingdom of the Heavens, as mentioned above. And that is the start and the foundation of all matters of service [to God], as per the holy Zohar mentioned above. For if he does not first accept that, he has not done anything. And according to what has been said, the reason for the prohibition of placing [the separation of] the tithe before the first fruits is understood. For without having the yoke of the kingdom of the Heavens first, one cannot serve [God].

And the content of the blowing of the shofar is a broken heart - moaning, wailing, like sick people moan or like one wails about his dead. And that is that a person sees himself as if his powers have already disappeared due to his sickness, or as if he has already died and has no hope. But behold he is purified by the breaking of his heart, like the matter of a clay vessel, which is purified by breaking it. So the Satan is no longer able to accuse [them of sins], since their impurity has removed itself from them. Yet there is nevertheless hope about them for the [Satan]. He is [however] a foolish old king, as he thinks that maybe because of their subjugation and the breaking of their heart they will fall into the pits of sadness, despair and black humor, as this is the worst of all. Hence he still makes efforts to bring piles of iniquities and to accuse, in order that this will cause sadness and despair to the Jewish people below, God forbid. However when he sees that they go back and blow the shofar while they are standing - that is, that they are aroused with new life and hold the commandments dear - then the hands of the Satan weaken and he loses all hope. So he is confused and no longer knows what to do. But he is afraid to continue bringing piles of sins and to accuse, lest from the accusation, the Jewish people will add to their arousal and their new life to the point that the [verse] will be fulfilled, "If only My people would listen to Me, if Israel would follow My paths, then would I subdue their enemies at once, strike their foes again and again" (Psalms 81:14-15). And it is as they said, 'If you will listen to His voice today, He will blow the great shofar [of redemption],' so that the time will come for [the Satan] to be swallowed up.
