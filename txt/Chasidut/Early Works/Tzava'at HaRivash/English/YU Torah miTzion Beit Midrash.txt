Tzava'at HaRivash



Chapter 1



Chapter 2

‎“I place <i>(shiviti)</i> Hashem before me, always” <small>(Tehillim 16:8)</small>. <i>Shiviti</i> is an expression of equating. ‎That is, every matter that arises before a person must be considered as equal. This is true when ‎others praise or denigrate someone, and so too with all other matters. Similarly, regarding food, ‎whether eating delicacies or anything else, all should be equal in one’s eyes, because the evil ‎inclination has been removed from him entirely.
Whatever arises, a person must declare, “This too ‎is from Hashem, and if it is proper in His eyes, etc.,” and all of a person’s actions should be for the ‎sake of Heaven, although from the individual’s perspective there is no difference [between good ‎and bad events] at all.  This is a very high level.‎ 

Chapter 3

Every person must serve Hashem with all their strength, for it is all necessity, for Hashem desires ‎that people serve Him in every way.
Meaning: there are times when a person engages in ‎conversation and is unable to learn  Torah. At these times, a person must maintain focus on ‎Hashem and perform [Kabbalistic] yichudim. And when a person is going on the way and is unable ‎to pray or learn as usual, and one must find other ways in which to serve Hashem,
one must never ‎be distraught about these things. Hashem wishes to be served in many ways, and therefore He ‎grants the opportunity to travel or converse in order to serve Hashem in that way. 

Chapter 4

“Commit your ‎deeds to Hashem, and your thoughts will be established” <small>(Mishlei 16:3)</small>. Everything that occurs, a ‎person should think that it is from Him.‎ It is appropriate for one to ask Hashem to always grant what Hashem knows to be in one’s best ‎interest, and not what a person thinks based on their own mind. It is possible that what is good in ‎one’s eyes could be detrimental. As such one should cast everything, all of one’s matters and ‎needs, upon Hashem.‎
