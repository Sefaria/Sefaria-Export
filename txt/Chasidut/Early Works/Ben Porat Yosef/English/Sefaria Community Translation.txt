Foreword



Introduction











































































































































































Rather the Torah presented us with a didactic hint about the service of God in general, when doing the commandments – shofar, sukkah, Pesach, tefillin and the like – that each one contains action, speech and will, which is the thought and intention of the commandment and of the prayer. And that is great and awesome, and not everyone – even with those involved in growth – know one part of the thousands and thousands of parts that the Men of the Great Assembly had in mind with the intentions of the prayers. And likewise with the intentions for the commandments. And, in truth, every single Jew has a great need for all three of these aforementioned aspects. As from the act of the commandment, the garment for the soul is made in the lower Garden of Eden; whereas the garment for the soul in the higher Garden of Eden is made from the intention of the commandment. Hence the advice that is given is to include himself and his intention – whether in prayer or in a commandment, or the intention of his eating during the week, and all the more so with the eating of the three Shabbat meals – and join his intention with that of the other Jews of complete faith, who know the intentions of prayer and of a commandment and about the secret of the intention of the Men of the Great Assembly and that which is similar to it. And this is the secret that the Ari, may his memory be blessed, wrote: Before prayer, one must say, “love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18), in order to fulfill the positive commandment. This is so as to include his prayer and his intention with those that know [how] to unify the higher traits. And it is enough with that.
