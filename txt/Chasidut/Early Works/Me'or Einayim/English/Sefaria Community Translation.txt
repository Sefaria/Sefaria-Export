Introduction



Bereshit

<i>With the beginning</i> — with the Torah, which is called the beginning of his work (Prov. 8:22) — the Holy Blessed One created the world (Zohar 1:5a). We find that every thing was created by way of the Torah and the power of the actor is in that which is acted upon, in which case the power of the Torah is in each thing and in all the worlds, and also in the person as is written, <i>This is the Torah: A person</i> (Num. 19:14) as we will clarify. And the Torah and the Holy Blessed One are one (Zohar 1:24a), so we find in all things the life-force of the Holy Blessed One. 
<i>And you give life to them all</i> (Nehemiah 9:6), you contract, as if it were possible, down to the lowest levels; and a portion of Divinity from above is placed within the darkness of materiality. For the whole essence of the intention is so that the lowest levels can rise above and have <i>the advantage of light over darkness</i> (Ecclesiastes 2:13). And this is the meaning of Joseph’s descent to Egypt, the lowest levels, “the ocean strait;” for through this enjoyment is increased as is written, <i>the advantage of light</i>, that enjoyment advances when it is lifted <i>over darkness</i>, and therefore he is called Joseph, connoting addition [<i>tosefet</i>]. And that is [the meaning of the verse (Gen. 42:1)] <i>when Jacob saw that there was grain</i> [<i>shever</i>] — connoting breakage [<i>shvirah</i>], which are the degenerations of Heavenly Wisdom, Torah that has fallen and broken; all that descends from its level is called “broken.”  <i>In Egypt</i>, in the ocean strait: for he saw there degenerations of Torah that fell there and needed to be clarified and elevated. And he said, <i>Go down there</i> (Gen. 42:2) to elevate and descend to bring [them] to the life-force of the root and the self. And that is the meaning of <i>Joseph died</i> (Gen. 50:26), for the fact that the Torah descended until the final level is called “death,” for whatever descends from its level is called “death” (Zohar 3:135b). <i>And they embalmed him</i> (Gen. 50:26): for the Torah is called “Tree of Life,” and with trees we go according to the ripening of fruit, which is to say even though he descended to the final level he bore fruit. <i>And he was put in a coffin</i> (Gen. 50:26), as in the statement [of our Sages] of Blessed Memory, “The Tablets and the Broken Tablets were placed in the ark” (Bava Batra 14b): even the degenerations have elevation to be in the ark just like the Tablets, which are the Torah itself. And we will return to the matter at hand: since in every thing it is the Torah that gives that thing life, one should not look at any thing in its materiality, only at the internality of the thing in the secret of <i>The wise person has his eyes in his head</i> (Ecclesiastes 2:14); and in the Zohar they said, “And where else should a person’s eyes be? Rather, a wise person gazes to see who stands above his head” (Zohar 3:187a), which is to say that in every thing he should gaze toward the beginning of that thing: from where it evolved and who is that thing’s root.
And that is [the meaning of] <i>With the beginning created</i> etc., with the Torah were created <i>the heavens and the earth</i>, which are the collective of everything and all things within them. And as was stated by our Sages of Blessed Memory, “את includes the derivatives;” <i>and the earth</i>, which is to say one who is immersed in worldliness, <i>was chaos and void</i>, since he does not gaze at the life-force and of their own accord they are <i>chaos and void</i> [<i>tohu va-vohu</i>]. And Rashi explained that a person is astonished [<i>toheh</i>] and amazed at the emptiness [<i>bohu</i>] within it, which is to say that someone who is “a person” is astonished at the fool who is immersed in worldliness: for “it is within him” [<i>bo hu</i>], which is to say that the Holy Blessed One’s life-force is within him, yet he does not understand and distances himself from [God]! But when a person looks in all things toward the life-force he fulfills <i>I have set YHVH before me always</i> (Psalm 16:8), that in every matter he sets before him “Existence,” the one who forms all existence.
And our Sages of Blessed Memory said, “Anyone who learns not for its own sake, it would have been better for him if his placenta had been overturned” etc. (Kallah Rabbati 5.1); but another time they said, “A person should always engage in Torah and mitzvot, even if not for their own sake, since through [the performance of mitzvot] not for their own sake, [one] comes [to perform them] for their own sake” (Pesahim 50b). And we can understand this along these lines: for we can ask, how can you find the aspect of “not for its own sake” in the world, when the life-force of all things is the Torah — and who is it that gives life-force to the aspect of “not for its own sake?” But is it not the case that one learns not for its own sake on account of some evil characteristic, or because of human self-glorification or self-aggrandizement, or an account of desire for money and the like? And that is a characteristic of glorification that fell into brokenness; but its essence is glorification of the Creator and [God’s] desire. And this [person] took the glorification and desire for himself; but when he understands that this evolved from the Creator’s glorification, and from his love grasps onto the thing’s root and beginning — for <i>The wise person has his eyes in his head</i> as we have stated — we find that when he gathers the thought of desire and glorification into himself, he returns through it to its root, we find that he comes from the aspect of “not for its own sake” immediately to the aspect of “for its own sake.” And that means a person should always engage and teach himself that through “not for its own sake” he brings himself into “for its own sake.” But when he does not do this and remains in “not for its own sake” — that is when they said, “It would have been better for him” etc. Now, the Torah is called “light,” <i>but the fool walks in darkness</i> (Ecclesiastes 2:14), for he engages not for its own sake; but one who sites in darkness must kindle a light. And that is [the meaning of the verse], <i>and darkness over the face of the deep</i>, because he is immersed in worldliness and does not kindle the light of Torah; and on accont of this we find the aspect of “not for its own sake” in the world. Regarding this it says, <i>And the Spirit of God hovers over the face of the waters</i>, that through this one can return and bring oneself to the essential life-force and [God’s] Divinity as we have said.
<i>And God said, “Let there be light.”</i> When a person engages for its own sake, for God’s sake, his speaking then kindles light. Initially, light and darkness served in mixture; for the Torah is called “light” and the foreign turning is called “darkness.” But now <i>God separated the light from the darkness</i>. And that is [the meaning of the Sages] of Blessed Memory’s statement, “Why do goats [<i>izzim</i>] walk in front?” (Shabbat 77b), which is to say Israel, who are called “strongest” [<i>azzim</i>] of the nations as in [the Sages] of Blessed Memory’s statement (Beitzah 25b). What is the reason they have the power to go and attach themselves to the Head, which is the beginning of everything? And they said that “at first [it] was dark,” they are in the darkness of the levels, and they return from there to light, attaching themselves and elevating themselves from there to light, and sweetening the small mind with greatness; therefore they have this power. 
But this is not true of the Nations of the World, who remain in smallness and materiality; and therefore our Sages of Blessed Memory said about Balaam, “He does not even know how to divine the mind of his animal!” (Berakhot 7a), and it is understood. A person is created small — in small mind — and yet the Holy Blessed One’s intention in creating humanity was to serve [God], so why did [God] create him initially without mind, without awareness to serve [God]? But this is also for the previously stated reason, for <i>wisdom has the advantage over folly</i> (Ecclesiastes 2:13), and darkness yearns to merge into light (Zohar 1:17a). For smallness is considered “feminine” with respect to greatness, <i>Your desire shall be for your husband</i> (Gen. 3:16). The feminine awakens longing in the groom; the person is initially in the aspect of smallness and afterward, when he comes into great mind, he attaches everything — even the smallness — to greatness and he has the aspect of “coupling.” And that is [the meaning of the verse], <i>as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you</i> (Isaiah 62:5), and it will be clarified elsewhere. And it is impossible to come to the light of greatness immediately, therefore smallness comes first. And that is the second interpretation [of the question], “Why do goats [<i>izzim</i>],” which means a person’s arrogance [<i>azzut</i>], “walk in front.” That is to say, smallness comes to a person first; and the answer is “According to the creation of the world, which at first was dark” etc. as was stated. And that is [the meaning of the verse] <i>And God called the light Day</i> etc. — just as there is no day without night, just so <i>there was evening</i>, which is the smallness first, and afterward <i>there was morning</i>, the great mind that inspects his deeds. <i>One day</i>: they are made into a single unity. And this is the general order according to which every person should walk, that upon arriving at thirteen years awareness should enter him. “Awareness” connotes attachment from the lower level to the upper; and that is complete awareness along the lines of <i>Return, wayward children</i> (Jeremiah 3:22), which is to say things that have been made <i>wayward</i> as in <i>he went wayward in the way of his heart</i> (Isaiah 57:17), return and attach together. However, there are those who do not merit awareness even at thirteen years, and they are called “small.” And a person who has no awareness is seduced after his Inclination; and that is the meaning of the seduction that is written in the Torah, in the incident of Potiphar and Joseph. And one must save oneself as Joseph saved himself. And my Teacher, may he be remembered for life in the World to Come, commented on what [our Sages] of Blessed Memory said, that he saw a vision of his father’s image (Sotah 36b) and the clothes that she wore for him in the morning she did not wear for him in the evening (Yoma 35b): but Joseph gazed at the source of beauty and glorification — from where does it come? For the essence of glorification is God’s life-force, which is the characteristic of Jacob, Splendor. And that is [the meaning of] “a vision of his father’s image;” and we find that each person needs to do so.

Noach



<i>Noah walked with God</i> (Gen. 6:9) Rashi explained: “But regarding Abraham it says, [<i>Walk before me</i> (Gen. 17:1)], <i>Before whom I have walked</i> (Gen. 24:40); Noah needed assistance to support him, but Abraham strengthened himself with his righteousness and walked independently.” But this is difficult to understand as well, for does the verse not say <i>[Noah was a] completely righteous [man]</i> (Gen. 6:9)?  And if [Rashi’s comment is correct,] then he is not “complete” since he lacks the level of Abraham!
But it is known that everything depends on Arousal from Below, which is the aspect of Feminine Water like the Desire of the Feminine for the Masculine.  And we, the Nation of the Children of Israel, have the aspect of Feminine with respect to the Holy Blessed One; and when we arouse ourselves to attach to our Blessed Creator from Below to Above, we arouse (as if it were possible) Desire in our Blessed Creator to channel us all Good, <i>selah</i>!  And the flow descends from Above to Below with abundance and blessing and compassion and life and peace. So we, the Assembly of Israel, along with the Holy Blessed One are a single complete entity, when we are attached to Blessed God.  And one without the other (as if it were possible) is not called “complete,” as in the statement “The Name is not complete nor is the Throne complete” (Tanhuma, Ki Tetze 11).  For we are called the Blessed Creator’s Throne, since (as if it were possible) without us the Blessed Creator is not called “complete” and obviously without Blessed God we [are not called “complete”]. Only when we first arouse the Feminine Waters, meaning our Desire from Below to Above to attach to Blessed God, through this we arouse Blessed God’s Desire from Above to Below.  And then, when the two Desires come together then it is one complete entity.  And this is the meaning of the verse <i>You shall be complete with Adonai your God</i> (Deut. 18:13), which is to say you with Blessed God are called a complete entity. And so the essence of Creation was on this condition, that we would walk to Blessed God by way of Arousal from Below initially.  And if not, God forbid, meaning when we do not arouse ourselves through Arousal from Below and need Blessed God to arouse us from Above, then we have done nothing. And so regarding Noah there was no Arousal from Below, [and Noah was saved] only because Blessed God wanted the preservation of the world, which would be preserved through Noah.  Therefore Blessed Good needed to arouse him from Above, and needed to channel onto Noah the Desire to attach to Blessed God.  And this is [what Rashi meant by] “Noah needed assistance to support him.”  But Abraham our Ancestor, peace be upon him, “strengthened himself with his righteousness and walked independently” through Arousal from Below. And now it makes sense that [Noah] was called <i>completely righteous</i>, since he was attached to Blessed God but not through Arousal from Below; and therefore it is written, <i>These are the records of the skies and the earth in their creation</i> [<i>be-hibar’am</i>] (Gen. 2:4), the letters of “Abraham” – meaning, as we have explained, that the Essence of Creation is through this: that the way of walking is like the walk of Abraham our Ancestor, peace be upon him, through Arousal from Below as we have explained.


Lech Lecha

































<i>Go yourself</i> (Gen. 12:1): Rashi explained, “For your pleasure and your benefit.” Now, our Sages of Blessed Memory said, regarding the verse, <i>Do you indeed, who are mute, speak righteousness?</i> (Psalm 58:2): “How should a person act in this world? Let him make himself as a mute. Could this even apply to words of Torah? The verse teaches, speak righteousness” (Hullin 89a). For it is known that it is written, <i>Lord, open my lips</i> (Psalm 51:17), because the Blessed Creator, <i>the whole earth is full of [God’s] glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3), no place is void of [God]; but [God’s] glory connotes cloaking as is known, that Blessed [God] is cloaked in each thing. And this aspect is called Shekhinah because it dwells [<i>shokhein</i>] in each thing; and that is the Blessed Name <i>Lord</i>. And it is also called the world of speech since <i>By the word of YHVH the heavens were made</i> (Psalm 33:6) and “the Holy Blessed One created the world through Torah” (Zohar 1:5a), meaning through the twenty-two letters of the Torah – the world of speech – all the creations were created. And it is stated in <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>,  “They were set in the human mouth” (<i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> [Luria ver.] 2.3), and that is the meaning of Lord, open my lips. And therefore our Sages of Blessed Memory said that “Evil speech is equivalent to idolatry” etc. (Arakhin 15b), for a person who speaks evil speech does not believe that his words are the world of speech, the charateristic of Lordship. And that is [the meaning of the verse], <i>With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?</i> (Psalm 12:5), as we have explained elsewhere. And that is [the meaning of the Talmud’s statement], “Make himself as a mute,” meaning his essence. That is, he should not speak any speech unless he believes that of his own account he is mute, and his only speech is the world of speech, the characteristic of “Lord” as we have explained. And they ask: “Could this even apply to words of Torah,” that a person should not learn unless he believes as we have explained? “The verse teaches, <i>speak righteousness</i>,” it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to learn even if it is not for its own sake. And that is [the meaning of] what our Sages of Blessed Memory said, “Someone who converses meaningless conversation transgresses a positive commandment, as it says, <i>you shall speak of them</i> (Deut. 6:7) and not of meaningless things” (Yoma 19b). And it would seem, how could it be possible that a person should speak no speech other than words of Torah as is implied by the language of <i>you shall speak of them</i> etc.? But the explanation is this: <i>you shall speak of them</i> means to say that whatever you speak, you should believe that you speak with the Torah, whose speech is the world of speech, the twenty-two letters of the Torah as we have explained. And when you speak through world-guiding, do not worry, for the Holy Blessed One created the world through Torah and guides the world through Torah; all the world are led by the twenty-two letters of Torah, the world of speech, but only if you believe this as we have explained. But if you speak not for the sake of world-guiding, that is called “meaningless things.”
And that is also [the meaning of] what our Sages of Blessed Memory said, “Let all your deeds be for the Name of Heaven” (Avot 2.12). For this aspect that dwells in the lower things, which we call Shekhinah, which is the Blessed Name “Lord,” which is cloaked in every thing, is called “Name;” and the Blessed Name YHWH is called “Heaven,” connoting clarity. And that is [the meaning of] “for the Name of Heaven,” meaning to unite these two aspects as we have explained many times.  And that is [the meaning of] <i>Go yourself</i> as Rashi explained, “For your pleasure and your benefit.” For it would seem difficult [to understand] – why would Blessed God open with [the idea that] he should do this on account of a turning toward his own pleasure and benefit? For even without this he certainly would have done Blessed God’s will! But Blessed God teaches us how to serve [God], and said to him: <i>Go yourself</i>, meaning even a thing that you do for yourself, for your pleasure and benefit, in this you should also find a pathway to Blessed God, in that “All your deeds be for the Name of Heaven” as mentioned above.

Vayera

<i>And the LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three [men were standing in front of him]. When he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the earth</i> (Gen. 18:1-2). It is written in the Holy Zohar, “Who were these three men? Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” (Zohar 1:98a). Now, it is known that the Holy Torah must be in every person and in every time, since it is eternal; but the truth is that the Blessed Creator is found in each Jew, and even in the most wicked person and in the worst sinner, God forbid. And the proof is that every wicked person has notions of teshuvah each day,  and that is [the meaning of] Blessed God’s appearing to him.  And when he goes with this, when he elevates his mind, then he begins to ask, “When will my actions arrive at the actions of my Ancestors?” (cf. <i>Tanna D’Vei Eliyahu Rabbah</i> [Friedmann ed.] ch. 23). For the Ancestors are themselves the chariot; and what is the chariot? It is written in <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>, “The horse is secondary to the rider, but the rider is not secondary to the horse” (Tikkun 70, 134a) such that the horse could go any place it wants, leading him into the river and to filthy places; instead, it must go to the place where the rider wills it to go. And when a person is a chariot for [God’s] Great Name, he goes only to the place where Blessed God wants [him to go], he does only Blessed God’s will and not the Evil Inclination’s will.
And that is [the meaning of] <i>And the LORD appeared to him</i> written plain instead of being written “to Abraham,” for it applies to each Jew that Blessed God will appear to him. <i>By the oaks of Mamre</i>: <i>oaks</i> connote strength; <i>Mamre</i> connotes rebellion [<i>hamra’ah</i>], meaning even in the strength of rebellion, when a person rebels [<i>mamre</i>] against Blessed God’s word.  That is, even a very wicked person, God forbid – Blessed God appears to him, which are the notions of <i>teshuvah</i> that come to him as we have explained above. <i>As he sat at the door of his tent</i>, meaning that this opens a door for him in the heat of the day, when the passion of notions of teshuvah come to him. <i>He lifted up his eyes</i>, meaning that when he elevates his mind <i>and looked, and behold, three men [were standing in front of him]</i> – Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which is to say that it is the level of the Ancestors, who were a chariot for [God’s] Great Name. <i>When he saw them, he ran to meet them</i>, that he said, “When will my actions arrive at the actions of my Ancestors?”  And he also wants to arrive at this level, to be a chariot for Blessed [God], to go only to the place where Blessed [God] wants [him to go]. <i>From the tent door</i>, from that door which they opened for him as we have explained above. Then he <i>bowed</i> on his face: this bowing is a channeling [of divine energy], meaning he channels [divine energy] into the aspect of Earthliness – and understand this.



In the Talmud of Shabbat (127a): Rav Yehudah quoted Rav: Welcoming guests is more important than receiving the Face of the Shekhinah, as it says, <i>do not pass by your servant</i> (Gen. 18:3).  Rabbi Elazar said: Come and see that the character of the Holy Blessed One is not like the character of flesh and blood – the character of flesh and blood, the lesser can not say to the greater, “Wait until I come to you;” but regarding the Holy Blessed One, [Abraham] says, <i>do not pass by your servant</i> etc.
Now we must understand the language of the verse, do not pass by etc.  For it is impossible to say this about the Blessed Shekhinah since <i>all the earth is full of God’s glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3) and no place is void of Him; and how could he say, <i>do not pass by</i> etc., which implies that place (as if it were possible) is not a place of God’s glory, which is impossible. And, according to this, we must also understand the interpretation of Rav Yehudah, quoting Rav, who said, “Welcoming guests is more important” etc. – how can he prove from this verse that welcoming guests is more important?  Perhaps [Abraham acted this way] because in fulfilling the <i>mitzvah</i> of welcoming guests he will also receive the Face of the Shekhinah.  As is known, that is why they are called <i>mitzvot</i> – <i>mitzvah</i> on account of the Attachment with which the person attaches the Godly part that dwells within him to the collective Blessed Endless, from the terminology of Fellowship [<i>tzavvta</i>].  And if so, then it is possible that the <i>mitzvah</i> itself is not more important than receiving the Face of the Shekhinah, but only in [Abraham’s] case there was also receiving the Face of the Shekhinah and he could fulfill both of them. And regarding the interpretation of Rabbi Elazar as well, who said, “the character of the Holy Blessed One is not like … the lesser can not say to the greater, ‘Wait…’ but regarding Abraham” etc., it is difficult as we have explained – in [Abraham’s] case, was there not also receiving the Face of the Shekhinah [as well as welcoming guests]?  And specifically, since <i>tzaddikim</i> are called Faces of the Shekhinah because the Blessed Shekhinah dwells within them as is known from the Book of the Zohar, when he received the guests, i.e., angels who appeared like people, he was certainly receiving the Face of the Shekhinah.
But the truth is as follows: the performance of a <i>mitzvah</i> is primarily based on the aspect of receiving the Face of the Shekhinah, which is the Attachment, from the terminology of Fellowship which is implied by the terminology of <i>mitzvah</i>.  Just as [the Sages] said in [Pirkei] Avot, “The reward of <i>mitzvah</i> is <i>mitzvah</i>” (Mishnah, Avot 4.2), the essential reward from the <i>mitzvah</i> is the <i>mitzvah</i>, i.e., the Godly Attachment and the Spiritual Enjoyment that is in the performance of a <i>mitzvah</i> in the aspect of receiving the Face of the Shekhinah.  For without this, the <i>mitzvah</i> is called “empty,” meaning it is without life-force and soul, and is merely the body of the <i>mitzvah</i> as is known.  It is only called <i>mitzvah</i> through the Desire and Attachment of the Godly part that dwells within him to the Blessed Root along with all the parts of Israel, as is known.  For all Godly Service, whether in speech or action, has the aspect of Body and Soul, which gives life to that speech or action and without which it is without life-force.  And therefore “the wicked are called ‘dead’ in their lifetime” (Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 18b) because their actions are without life-force. But in truth the request made by Abraham our Ancestor, peace be upon him, was this: <i>do not pass by</i> etc., because he was engaged in receiving the Face of the Shekhinah with certainty as is explicit in the verse <i>And the LORD appeared to him</i> (Gen. 18:1).  And at the moment he saw the guests he asked Blessed God that even when he went to fulfill [the <i>mitzvah</i> of] welcoming guests <i>do not pass by your servant</i>: let the <i>mitzvah</i> not be empty, God forbid, but may You be with me even there, so that I can fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> with Attachment, which is the aspect of receiving the Face of the Shekhinah. And the proof of Rav Yehudah’s [interpretation], that welcoming guests is greater than receiving the Face of the Shekhinah, is that if welcoming guests were not greater, Abraham our Ancestor, peace be upon him, certainly would not have set aside the certainty of receiving the Face of the Shekhinah and gone to welcome guests, which is in doubt [as to whether it will or will not include receiving the Face of the Shekhinah].  For [Abraham] needed to request, regarding [welcoming guests], that there would also be receiving the Face of the Shekhinah and Attachment to Blessed God.  And specifically it is known what our Sages of Blessed Memory said, “They appeared to him as Arabs” (i.e., ordinary passersby; Babylonian Talmud, Kiddushin 32b), and so as far as he could tell they were not called “Faces of the Shekhinah.”  Rather, certainly the <i>mitzvah</i> itself is much greater, even if – God forbid – it would not include receiving the Face of the Shekhinah; but [Abraham] requested to do this <i>mitzvah</i> in complete wholeness, as he said, do not pass by etc., and understand this.
And this is also the meaning of the statement of Rabbi Elazar: “the character of the Holy Blessed One is not like the character of flesh and blood – the character of flesh and blood, the lesser can not say to the greater, ‘Wait,’” because in a place where he walks away his honor is no longer there; if he is here, he can’t be there.  But regarding the Holy Blessed One it is written, <i>all the earth is full of God’s glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3) and therefore [Abraham] requested, <i>do not pass by</i> etc. because Blessed God’s Glory is there also, and there too may I not be divided from my Attachment to You.  And [Abraham] could say this because he does not walk away from God no matter where he walks; his only request was not to be divided from Blessed God, because Blessed God is there, too, as He is here, and understand this.

Chayei Sara















<i>[Now Abraham was old, well advanced in days;] and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things</i> (Gen. 24:1), and it is stated in the Midrash, “By what merit? By the merit of tithing” (Midrash Tanhuma [Warsaw ed.] Hayyey Sarah #4).  For it is known that regarding the <i>mitzvah</i> of tithing it is said, <i>[Bring the full tithes into the storehouse…] and thereby put me to the test, [says the LORD of hosts,] if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need</i> (Malakhi 3:10).
The meaning is that there are many channels of abundance through which the abundance travels by any means until it arrived below to the person. But the person’s corruption below causes blockage in the channels; and that is how he comes, by way of his corruption, to the place of the judgments. The judgments stand and accuse and do not allow the life-force, the abundance, to travel to this person; and this is called “blocking the channels.” The virtue of tithing is to transcend the judgments and sweeten the judgments until the judgments consent to the influence of the blessing below, on account of their having been sweetened. And we must understand why this is: for it is known that “In the measure with which a man measures, so is he measured” (Sotah 8b); however a person behaves below, in a certain characteristic,  so is it aroused above. If he arouses [in himself] the characteristic of compassion, the same is aroused above as well; and through this he causes sweetening of the judgment. But if, God forbid, the opposite, etc. And therefore through tithing – which is <i>tzedakah</i> – this also causes compassion above on account of his arousing the characteristic of compassion below. And so it is for all the characteristics: a person must offer himself to the Good and imitate his Creator as our Sages of Blessed Memory said, “Just as [God] is compassionate, etc.” (Massekhet Soferim 3.13). Now, regarding Abraham it says, <i>Abraham was old, well advanced in days</i>, which is duplicative language. But it is known that the upper characteristics are called the “thirteen arrangements of seniority;” and that is the connotation of <i>old</i>, that he had arrived at all the “arrangements of seniority,” which are called <i>old</i>. <i>In</i> upper <i>days</i>, he offered himself, with all the characteristics and days, to the upper Good – the place where there are no judgments at all. And that is [the meaning of] “By what merit:” “merit” [<i>z’khut</i>] connotes success as in, “I did not succeed [<i>zakhiti</i>] etc.” (Mishnah, Berakhot 1.5). <i>Surely there is not a righteous man on earth [who does good and never sins]</i> (Ecclesiastes 7:20), but here it is written, <i>and the LORD</i>, “He and His house of judgment,”  implying that [the judgments] consented to bless [Abraham]! And is it possible that there would not be a single judgment to obstruct the descending of abundance? So they taught, “By the merit of tithing” as it is written, <i>And Abram gave him a tenth of everything</i> (Gen. 14:20); as is stated above, that this sweetened the judgments until they consented, “He and His house of judgment” all together, to a complete blessing as we have explained.

Toldot

















In the verse, <i>Isaac's servants came</i> (Gen. 26:32): It is stated in the Midrash, “We do not know if they found water or not; when it says, <i>We have found water</i> (Gen. 26:32), we see they found water” (Genesis Rabbah 64.10).
To understand this matter we will begin with the verse, <i>they have forsaken me, the source of living waters</i> (Jeremiah 2:13). Its meaning is that Blessed God is the source from whom comes the flow of life-force to all living things in all manners, <i>there is no other besides [God]</i> (Deut. 4:35); and anyone who is attached to [God] is attached to the root of life-force <i>whose waters do not fail</i> (Isaiah 58:11) – but only so long as there is no blockage from his side. For if, God forbid, on account of his sins he blocks himself from the source, his life-force will become absent; but from Blessed [God’s] side there is no blockage as the verse says, <i>but your iniquities have made a separation [between you and your God]</i> (Isaiah 59:2). But one whose life-force is from the Other Side, who are called <i>broken cisterns</i> (Jeremiah 2:13) since they are gathered waters into which fell sparks of life-force at the moment of breaking, and for this reason they are called <i>broken cisterns</i> – such a person is blocked from his Upper Root and is called <i>separator of close friends</i> (Proverbs 16:28, 17:9).  And therefore the Ancestors of the World, who opened the pipelines of intelligence in the world and taught awareness to all people, how to dig himself into the aspect of <i>a well of living water</i> (Gen. 26:19), to be attached to the source from which comes the root of his life-force. And [the Ancestors’] disciples are called by the name “servants,” as the verse says, <i>Isaac’s servants</i> (Gen. 26:32), since their service of the Blessed Creator came by way of the Ancestors.
But after Abraham’s death, these springs of wisdom were stopped up, because they <i>were stopped by the Philistines</i> (Gen. 26:18) who are the aspect of evil which is set in a person, who had overpowered the world; and the element of Earth had overpowered [the others] and in proportion the spiritual and intellectual powers weakened. But when Isaac, his son, came and held to his father’s path, he taught this awareness to the people of his generation as well – to return and dig to the aspect of a well of living water through many types of intelligences and great and concealed counsels – until <i>Isaac dug again the wells of water</i> (Gen. 26:18). All this comes by way of faith, which is the precursor to this: that one believes with complete faith that Blessed God, <i>the whole earth is filled with [God’s] Glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3) and no place is void of [God], <i>there is no other besides [God]</i> (Deut. 4:35). And then, by way of this faith, he yearns for [God] and desires to hold to and attach himself to Blessed God, who has the aspect of <i>valley</i> [<i>nahal</i>] (Gen. 26:19), which is an acronym for <i>Our soul waits for the LORD</i> [<i>nafsheynu hiktah la-ADONAI</i>] (Psalm 33:20), which [means] by way of faith. And then, through this, he comes to his root, which is the spring of the <i>well of living waters</i> that we have described. And that is [the meaning of] <i>when Isaac's servants dug in the valley</i> (Gen. 26:19) – the aspect of <i>valley</i> as we have stated – <i>and found there a well of living water</i> (Gen. 26:19), etc., <i>The herdsmen of Gerar quarreled … so he called the name of the well Esek</i> etc. (Gen. 26:20), <i>Then they dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah</i> (Gen. 26:21), <i>And he moved from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. So he called its name Rehoboth, saying, “For now [the LORD has made room for us]”</i> etc. (Gen. 26:22).
And now I must give awareness, education, and understanding regarding the matter of the three wells and their names, for the Ancestors looked through their great mind’s eye to the end of all the generations, with the tribulations that would befall them. It is known that during the time that the Temple stood there was an expansion of true awareness, how to draw close to the boundary in order to attach themselves to the aspect of <i>a well of living water</i>, more and more than in a time of exile; and even the Nations of the World would recognize a slight recognition, and would bring sacrifices as is written in the prayer of King Solomon, peace be upon him, <i>And when the foreigner shall come</i> etc. (1 Kings 8:41),  and as we find that even just before the Destruction the Caesar sent them a sacrifice, as is known (cf. Gittin 55b-56a). However, even in the time of the Temple the aspect of Good and Evil was still in the world, until on account of Israel’s sins Evil overpowered [Good] and the Temple was destroyed. And therefore the aspect of the well was called <i>Esek</i>. And afterward <i>they dug another well</i> (Gen. 26:21), which is the Second Temple of Ezra’s days, when this awareness again expanded until they knew how to dig to the aspect of “well.” <i>And they quarreled over that also, so he called its name Sitnah</i> (Gen. 26:21) on account of the Satan’s accusation, for the power of materiality had overcome the awareness until <i>he moved from there</i> (Gen. 26:22) in the aspect of the passage of time,  which is the lengthy exile, <i>and dug another well</i> (Gen. 26:22), which is the coming of our Righteous Messiah, speedily in our days, when there will be no Evil accusation at all as is written, <i>I will remove from the land … the spirit of uncleanness</i> (Zechariah 13:2), for then the world will be entirely Good. <i>So he called its name Rehoboth</i> (Gen. 26:22), for then will be expansion of awareness as the verse says, <i>for the earth shall be full of awareness of the LORD</i> (Isaiah 11:9). And we will merit to attach to the light of Blessed Infinity, to comprehend Blessed [God’s] Nature and to attach to Blessed God with eternal attachment. And that is [the meaning of] what is written after this, <i>From there he went up to Beersheba</i> (Gen. 26:23); for the Shekhinah is called “Beersheba,” we will merit to be on a high level, and understand this. However, every person must strengthen himself even in the times when Evil obstructs him and does not allow him to rise up to the aspect of “well;” nevertheless he should see through his mind’s eye that even in that place is a contraction of Blessed [God’s] Divinity, as we have said in a different place. And he should look at the obstruction and understand from it what is the root of his life-force, from which characteristic it is, whether from the aspect of Mercy [<i><u>h</u>esed</i>] or Strength [<i>gevurah</i>]. And he should see to bring it to its root, for through this characteristic, which he arouses to bring it close, through it he begins to serve the Blessed Creator, whether in thought or in word or in deed;  for these characteristics are Divinity, but they fell from their place in the breaking. And then Good will be made out of them as well. And similarly, if obstructions come to him from the side of judgments – coming to him from his root Above, the characteristic of Strength [<i>gevurah</i>], which is the characteristic of Isaac – he should understand through his awareness that these judgments are from the Upper Holy Place, except that they fell through the descent of the levels to the place of judgments, which is the place of <i>broken cisterns</i> (Jeremiah 2:13). And he should hold to the characteristic of Strength [<i>gevurah</i>], to revere Blessed God and to serve Blessed God immediately through this [characteristic], and to bring them to their roots and sweeten the judgments. For this is the secret: the judgments can only be sweetened at their roots, which is the characteristic of Isaac. For immediately when, through these judgments that came on account of his sins, he strengthens himself and serves with them at the root of their hold until they arrive at their root; for in that place is only absolute Divinity, the judgments are nullified and sweetened.
And through this the Sha"s in Shabbat (Shabbat 89b) can be explained, that Avraham our Father, Peace be Upon Him, said "they should be erased for the sake of the holiness of Your Name" and Itzchak said "half [of their sins] on me and half on You". Behold, Itzchak is [the symbol of] the characteristic of Gevurah, and was more successful than Avraham [the symbol of compassion] and this is understood from what is written above, that this is the root of judgments, and through the fact that they bring the judgments to their source, [the judgments] are cancelled. [And this is] As we say, the judgments are only sweetened at their root, specifically. ...

<i>Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haran</i> (Gen. 28:10). Rashi explained, “When he arrived in Haran he resolved to go back; immediately the land contracted for him, which is <i>And he came to a certain place</i> (Gen. 28:11).” 
Now, it is known that the extent to which the <i>tzaddik</i> serves Blessed God, Bless Him, through life-force and mind-states that are given to him from Above – for each one is in proportion to his measure, that he is able to comprehend the reality of the Blessed God – [to that extent] God’s Divinity, as if it were possible, is contracted [in order to reside] with him.  But afterward when he travels on this level for some time, the aspect of Divinity that was contracted with the <i>tzaddik</i> leaves him in order that he should strengthen himself to come to a greater level.  For the whole time that he is on this level he is unable to come to an even greater level, since that aspect is clothed in him and on account of his habituation he can not see any other aspect that is above him – because the nature of habit draws him to act according to the habit. But when this aspect in which he [resided] leaves him, then certainly <i>the tzaddik will hold his path</i> (Job 17:9) to attach to his root.  He begins to strengthen himself greatly because he fell from his level; and because of the great self-strengthening that he awakens, the assistance from Above also greatly increases in proportion to his awakening – as is known, that just as the awakening comes from Below, so Above is awakened and then he comes to an even greater level.
But nevertheless, even when the aspect of Divinity that he had leaves him, nevertheless an imprint of Holiness is left in him through which he can strengthen himself as we have said.  For without this he would remain Below, God forbid, after the Holiness leaves; and through the remaining of the imprint he strengthens himself as we have said.  For that is the nature of Holiness: that even after it leaves an imprint remains behind, as our Sages of Blessed memory said, “The Shekhinah has never moved from the Western Wall” (Exodus Rabbah 2.2).  And that is [the meaning of the verse], <i>for the tzaddik falls seven times and rises</i> (Prov. 24:16), meaning that he <i>falls</i> in order to be rising to an even greater level.  And all of this is for a <i>tzaddik</i>; but someone who is not within the bounds of <i>tzaddik</i>, the Holy Blessed One <i>devises plans so that the banished one will not remain an outcast</i> (2 Sam. 14:14) and wants to draw him close to God.  But because he is not attached to the Blessed Creator he falls to a place of Judgments.  For there are no Judgments upon someone who is attached to the Blessed Creator, since he is attached to the Source of the Life of Lives, where there is no Judgment.  But in the opposite case, one who is not attached, then [God] contracts Godself, as if it were possible, to the human, [God’s] Divinity to the place where that person is, in those Judgments that come upon him.  For through this [the person] will draw closer to Blessed God and will come to the aspect of <i>Beersheba</i>, which is to attach to [God’s] Blessed Reverence, which is called “The Well [<i>be’er</i>] of Living Water,” for one who is attached to this is sated [<i>save’ah</i>] from all the Eternal Good.
And that is [the meaning of the verse], <i>Jacob left Beersheba</i> – “Jacob” is called the aspect of the lower level, as suggested by the language of “heels.”  When he <i>leaves</i> the aspect of <i>Beersheba and goes toward Haran</i>, that he comes to the place of Judgments which are called “anger” [<i><u>h</u>aron</i>] – “When he arrived in Haran he resolved to go back,” which is to say on account of the Judgments that come upon him.  And in that place is a contraction of God’s Blessed Divinity, and on account of this he sets his heart to go back; “immediately the land,” which is the Upper Land of Life, “contracted for him” – as is known, “more than the calf wants to suckle, the cow wants to give suck” (Pesahim 112a).  For the Upper Life-force greatly yearns for the human, to dwell within him, except that the recipient does not have the power to receive it; but immediately when “he resolves to return,” which is the Feminine Waters, the Awakening from Below, “immediately the” Upper “land contracts for him,” as our Sages of Blessed Memory said, “[One who comes to purify], they assist him” (Yoma 38b).  And when he sets his heart to this, immediately the Judgments are sweetened and they fall from him, since he has come to the [ultimate] aim.

<b>Therefore, the children of Israel must not eat the raised tendon:</b> It is known about the secret of <i>ashan</i> - which is, world/year/living being (designated by the first letter of these three words, <i>olam/shanah/nefesh</i>) - that there is a complete stature to each of them from the 248 limbs and the 365 tendons, in the way of their structure. It is as the Raavad wrote in his commentary on Sefer Yetzirah on the verse (Exodus 19:18), "The entire Mount Sinai was all smoke (<i>ashan</i>)" - that the word, <i>ashan</i>, hints to <i>olam/shanah/nefesh</i>. Since just like there is structure to a living being from the 248 limbs and the 365 tendons, so too is there in the world - as we have found that the earth is referred to by the name of limbs, the navel of the earth, the mouth of the earth, the nakedness (genitalia) of the earth. And likewise with the year, the days are distinguished; such that each one of the 365 days is the aspect of a specific tendon. So the day of the 9th of Av is the aspect of the raised tendon from the stature of the year, which is the aspect of the rear, that is where the shells (<i>klipot</i>) have a hold. Hence it is the time of their control, since the first and second Temples were destroyed, Beitar was captured and [Jerusalem] was plowed over because it is the day of their control and their hold. For that day is given to them, that it should be a hold even in the stature of the year. It is just like Yom Kippur, which is an exalted day and is sanctified by a sanctification of [its] level over the entire year; since it is the life of the whole year and the choicest of all of them for holiness - such that this is why the Satan is not given permission to accuse. It is as our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said, "This corresponding to that, did God make." For the Ninth of Av is the chosen day for the other side (<i>sitra achra<i>, the side of evil), to be a great hold for [its forces] on this day. For it is because of this that what happened, happened.</i></i>

However behold, He should have started the Torah from its commandments! So why did He adorn it with the telling of stories? But the idea is that it is a commandment upon us to 'tell the story of the exodus from Egypt.' This is like the author of the Haggadah said, "And anyone who adds [and spends extra time] in telling the story of the exodus from Egypt, behold he is praiseworthy." But behold, to understand the idea of the "adding" that he said - note that the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said [that] the mundane speech of Torah scholar requires study. That is since it is certainly impossible to always speak of Torah, and one must [also] speak of physical things. But the 'righteous will stride in them' - even when they are speaking of physical things, they make them cling to Him, may He be blessed. So their [mundane] speech is truly Torah! For they elevate souls with this, just as with Torah study. And there are some souls that can be more elevated with talk than with Torah study. As they do not have the ability to be included in Torah and to rise with the Torah, but rather only with physical talk. And this is the idea of <i>yitziyat mitzrayim</i> (the exodus from Egypt). It is from the expression, <i>meitzar yam</i> (the border of the sea) - that is to say that it is close to the shore of the sea of true wisdom. Hence it is a commandment to always tell with <i>yitziyat mitzrayim</i>. The explanation of this is that, all the time and at every instant, whenever one speaks, his words should be with <i>yitziyat mitzrayim</i>. And this is the meaning of, "And anyone who adds, etc." For his telling should be with <i>yitziyat mitzrayim</i> not only on Passover, but even all the time.

<i>Behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows, healthy and good</i> (Gen. 41:2).  <i>For man and beast you save, O LORD</i> (Psalm 36:7), “These are people who are mentally crafty but consider themselves as animals” (Hullin 5b).   For a person, of his own account, has nothing; and the fact that he does have some good thing or quality comes from God, since <i>the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth [come knowledge and understanding]</i> (Proverbs 2:6). Now, the seven characteristics are: <b>(1)</b> Love [<i><u>H</u>esed</i>], to love God; <b>(2)</b> Awe [associated with the Kabbalistic sefirah of <i>Gevurah</i> (Strength)], to be in awe of [God]; <b>(3)</b> Beauty [<i>Tiferet</i>], to glorify God; <b>(4)</b> Victory [<i>Netzah</i>], to triumph over the Evil Inclination – “A person should always incite his Good Inclination against his Evil Inclination” (Berakhot 5a); <b>(5)</b> Splendor [<i>Hode</i>], to praise God; <b>(6)</b> Foundation [<i>Yesod</i>], so he will be connected to all these attributes; <b>(7)</b> And Majesty [<i>Malkhut</i>], to give dominion and power to God and to declare [God] King over all the world. Therefore the characteristics are called <i>cows</i>, because a person must consider himself as an animal. <i>And they fed in the reed grass</i> (Gen. 41:2), which is translated as “in fellowship;” for to the extent that a person hates his fellow, it is on account of arrogance, and it appears to him that he deserves the honor and the greatness and envies his fellow.  But one who considers himself as an animal, then he loves all the world and he bears no hatred against his fellow.
<i>And behold, seven other cows</i> etc. (Gen. 41:3), for the Evil Inclination comes to induce him to sin in the seven characteristics: to love the desire for money and other pleasures; to be in awe of punishment; to glorify himself; to triumph over his enemies; to praise himself; to be attached to all these things; and to take dominion for himself.  <i>And the cows swallowed</i> etc. (cf. Gen. 41:4), for with all of the <i>mitzvot</i> he performs, he gives power to the Shell, God save us; and that is [the meaning of] <i>swallowed</i>, that is to say that the Shell swallows the Torah and the <i>mitzvot</i>. But no one would have known that they had eaten them etc. (Gen. 41:21), therefore when the person does <i>teshuvah</i> “His sins become good deeds” (Yoma 86b), meaning he extracts the good deeds that he performed from under the Shell’s hand.  <i>And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream</i> (Gen. 41:7), when a person awakes from a sleeping time <i>and behold, it was a dream</i> [<i>halom</i>], which suggests “He returned and healed [<i>halim</i>].” Based on this reason, we read the Torah portion in question on Hanukkah, because the Torah is advice as is written, <i>I have advice [and sound wisdom; I am insight, I have strength]</i> (Proverbs 8:14) – it advises a person how to serve God and to return to [God] <b>(omitted)</b>[*The notation נשמט ("omitted") appears in the Hebrew text in all editions.].   Therefore it is forbidden to use [the Hanukkah candles’] light, since a person can turn in no direction other than to God alone – not for the sake of this world and also not for the sake of the next world.

<i>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El-Shaddai etc.</i> (Ex. 6:3).  Rashi explained, “Alas for those who are lost and not to be found!” etc.   The meaning, as is known, is that the secret of Egyptian Exile is that the True Awareness was in Exile; they could not grasp the Awareness to serve the Blessed Creator, along the lines of what is stated, <i>Know the God of your Ancestor and serve Him</i> (1 Chron 28:9).  For in truth, Awareness is the essence that brings one to complete Reverence and Love.  For once a person knows and believes that <i>the whole earth is full of [God’s] Glory </i>(Isaiah 6:3) and no place is void of Him, and [God] is the pleasure of all pleasures, Blessed is He and Blessed His Name, Life of Lives – if so, for any of the pleasures if you imagine, God forbid, the absence of the influence of [God’s] Blessed Light and Life-Force among the created things, Creation would return to <i>unformed and void</i> (Gen. 1:2).  And similarly for all the Upper and Lower Worlds, if you imagine, God forbid, the absence of [God’s] Life-Force, they would be as if they never were.  And if that is the case, then [Awareness of God’s presence] is the essence in all things...


However, each and every person must come into trial – even if he receives God’s Godliness into his thoughts as we have explained above – nevertheless each person is tested with ten trials, as they said about Abraham, “Abraham was tested with ten trials and withstood them all” (Mishnah, Avot 5:3).  And the trial is that they strip him of the Connection with which he was connected to Blessed God through Awareness.  At the moment when he comes into the trial, only Free Will remains with him; for without this it would not be called a trial.  For certainly through the Connection <i>the tzaddik holds his path</i> (Job 17:9), and in this way his Awareness is diminished – though not completely removed – and if he withstands the trial, it is because it was already fixed in his heart from before when he had expansive Awareness.




On the Matter of the Ten Plagues that Occurred in Egypt: The explanation is according to what is known, that the Blessed Creator directs the world through Ten Intelligences, which constitute Awareness.  Therefore in Egypt, where God wanted to reveal the secret of Awareness, one of the Intelligences was revealed through each of the Plagues until the complete revelation of Awareness was finished. Even though Connection [to God] is removed at the moment of trial, thereby diminishing Awareness as we have stated above, this diminishing also counts as revelation of Awareness since [the removal of Connection] is always necessary. So we find that there are two aspects to the revelation of Awareness: one by way of its expansion and the other by way of its diminishing at the moment of trial as we have stated.  And both of them together constitute revelation of Awareness; understand this. [Diminishing] is necessary precisely after the concealing shell has been broken; therefore a few of the plagues had no warning, such as Hail, Darkness, and Lice.  Along these lines, since each of the Ten Plagues was intended to reveal Awareness through its two aspects, as we have stated, therefore corresponding to the aspect of revelation of Awareness through expansion [the Plague] included warning.  For it is known that anyone liable for execution can only be executed after Awareness [of their crime] was introduced by two witnesses who warn them [before the fact] and give them Awareness verbally, as we know.  For without warning, even if [the killer] did it intentionally, in any event [we consider the killer to be] lacking [legal] awareness.   Therefore here, where God needed to introduce Awareness into the world through the Plagues, warning was necessary for this reason so that [the Plague] would break the shell that conceals this aspect of Awareness that must be expanded. But the Plagues for which there was no warning were intended to break the shell that conceals the aspect of Awareness that needs to be diminished at the moment of trial; understand this.

On the famous question, posed by the commentators: How could Choice be taken from [Pharaoh], when it was supposed to be free? And based on our way we should pay attention to read precisely the word these in [God’s] statement, <i>that I may show these signs of mine among them</i> (Ex. 9:1) – it is as if [God] points with a finger at the signs, that here they are before [Moses’] eyes; but in truth they were not visible to his eyes. However, the point of the Exodus from Egypt was that Awareness was in exile with Pharaoh; and that meant that the nation, although they were the Children of Israel, did not know God even though they had a tradition from the mouth of their holy ancestors, the fathers of the world. Nevertheless, since they were the fourth generation they had forgotten the true Awareness about which King David, peace be upon him, said to his son Solomon, <i>know the God of your father</i> (1 Chron. 28:9). And that is the essence of the exile, that Awareness was in exile in Egypt. And therefore wicked Pharaoh said <i>Who is the LORD?</i> etc. (Ex. 5:2), that he denied the essential principle and believed only in sorcery. For he was a great sorcerer and did not know God or that it is written, “<i>there is none but [God]</i> (Deut. 4:35), even sorcery,” “which contradicts the power of Heaven” (Sanhedrin 67b);  they have no ability to act beyond Blessed God’s will, as is explained in the Talmud in the incident of Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa. And therefore when Blessed God wanted to redeem [God’s] nation the Children of Israel from Egypt so that they would have the true Awareness, and to teach them that <i>the LORD is God</i> (Deut. 4:35), powerful and master of all abilities and powers, [God] said <i>that I may show these signs of mine among them</i>. That is to say, it was with [Pharaoh] in exile, and through this combination the word “<i>Elohim</i>” will be in wholeness and, and it will be known that <i>the LORD is God</i>, [God] is powerful and master of ability, and <i>there is none but [God]</i>, even sorcery as we have stated.
And through this we can explain the commentators’ question mentioned above. For the essence of Choice is what was stated in the verse, <i>See, I have set before you today life and good… therefore choose life</i> (Deut. 30:15, 19). And how should a person choose good from evil, if not through Awareness? When a person has the Awareness to distinguish between good and evil, then he can choose good and despise evil. Now, in the Egyptian exile the Awareness was in exile, as we have stated, and then they did not have the full choice, with full awareness. For this is the essence of the Exodus from Egypt, that the Awareness should come out of exile and there can be Choice with Awareness – which is not the case in exile, when Awareness was with [Pharaoh] in Egypt. Then, even Choice could not be; in which case Choice was not taken from Pharaoh at all, since Choice [itself] did not yet exist, as we have explained. For it came into being afterward, in their Exodus from Egypt, when the Awareness came out of exile – then Choice had something on which to take effect, as we have stated.
And with this, we can further clarify Maimonides’ question (Laws of Repentance 5.5), which is explained in <i>Zohar <u>H</u>adash</i> (Tikkunim 98a) in the name of the Ancient Ones, regarding the matter of Choice – which was given freely to Adam – and Blessed God’s knowledge: how can the two of them be as one?
However, when we said that the essence of Choice is Awareness – that when a person knows God with whole Awareness, then Choice is relevant, whereas without Awareness Choice has no relevance – and if that is the case, Choice and Knowledge are one; for with what should a person choose, if not Awareness? And God’s Awareness is Choice; if so, this is the essence of the Blessed Creator’s Knowledge: that [God] Knows the Choice, and they are not contradictory but they are all one as we have explained, and understand this.
Indeed, regarding what is explained in the Talmud, “A person does not commit a sin unless a spirit of nonsense has entered him” (Sotah 3a), relates to another matter. For is it not known what is stated in the verse, <i>the tzaddik shall live through his faith</i> (Habakuk 2:4)? For sometimes a person falls from Awareness, and it is by way of a trial from the Blessed Creator, by taking from him the Awareness in order to see if he will stand by God’s ways. Nevertheless <i>the righteous holds to his way</i> through his faith; and even though they take the Awareness from him, nevertheless he walks and strengthens himself in God’s ways. But this is not true if he does not have the faith; then when he falls from Awareness and “a spirit of nonsense enters him” he might commit a sin, God forbid. And this is what our Sages of Blessed Memory intended in their saying, “A person does not commit a sin unless a spirit of nonsense has entered him,” which is to say that he fell from Awareness by way of a trial. But in the Egyptian exile they did not have Awareness at all, and then there was no relevance for Choice as we have stated. And that is because the Awareness was in smallness, which is to say that they were in Awareness like a minor who has no [legal] awareness; and therefore it was stated in the Talmud, “A minor has no [legal] intention” (Hullin 13a). And that is [the meaning of] the verse’s further statement, <i>that you may tell … how I have toyed</i> [<i>hit’allalti</i>] <i>with the Egyptians</i> (Ex. 10:2), from the idiom of <i>child</i> [<i>ollel</i>] <i>and infant</i> (Jeremiah 44:7) – as if [God was saying] “Like I have made myself small in Egypt,” which is to say that the Awareness was in smallness in Egypt. And after this it says <i>that you may know that I am the LORD</i> (Ex. 10:2), which is to say that they will have the whole Awareness in their Exodus from Egypt, to know God with Awareness.
[Regarding] the statement in the Holy Zohar, “<i>Come to Pharaoh</i> (Ex. 10:1) – it should have said ‘<b>go</b> to Pharaoh!’” (cf. Zohar Bo, 2:34a), as well as the question posed by the commentators, which I wrote above – the miracle of the Exodus from Egypt was that the Awareness was in exile with wicked Pharaoh in Egypt; and therefore Israel was exiled there to bring the Awareness from there. And the difficulty of the servitude made it whole, as is stated in <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>: “<i>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve… in mortar</i> [<i>be-<u>h</u>omer</i>] (Ex. 1:13-14), that is [the logical argument of] ‘…and certainly…’ [<i>kal ve-homer</i>]; <i>and in brick</i> [<i>oo-vil’venim</i>] (Ex. 1:14), that is the heating [<i>libbun</i>] of halakhah; <i>and in all manner of service in the field</i> (Ex. 1:14), that is the external sources; <i>in all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor</i> [<i>b’farekh</i>] (Ex. 1:14), <i>that is argumentation</i> [<i>pirkha</i>]” (Tikkun 9, Supplement 147a), which is to say that all of this was in exile in Egypt. And through their servitude they took the Awareness, which is the Torah, out of the exile. When they served <i>in mortar</i> they brought [the logical argument of] “…and certainly…” out of the exile, and so on for all the other servitudes as we have stated. And therefore when Moses our Teacher, peace be upon him, said, <i>Behold, the people of Israel have not listened to me [ – How then shall Pharaoh listen to me]</i> (Ex. 6:12), and Rashi explained, “This is one of ten ‘…and certainly…’ [arguments] in the Torah,” that is to say that when [Moses] said this “…and certainly…” [argument] he brought the “…and certainly…” [argument] in the Torah out of the exile. For the all of the Torah was in the Egyptian exile, since the Awareness was in exile; and the Awareness is the Torah. Now, the Torah begins with [the letter] <i>bet</i>, <i>In the beginning [God] created</i> etc. (Gen. 1:1); but why didn’t the Torah begin with <i>aleph</i>, which is the first of all the letters? Because [if that were the case] the world would not be able to exist for even one hour, and would be nullified from existence because of the letter <i>aleph</i>’s great brightness, since it alludes to the Champion [<i>aluf</i>] of the World, who is Blessed God in [God’s] Glory and [God’s] Essence, as if it were possible. But <i>because the LORD God is a sun and shield</i> (Psalm 84:12) – which is to say just like one can not look at the sun because of its great brightness, only by way of a shade or a shield can one look at the sun’s light – so too, as if it were possible, with a thousand thousands of thousands of distinctions without end or boundary, would it be impossible to exist because of the letter <i>aleph</i>’s great brightness, since it is the Champion of the World. Only by way of a shade or a shield, which is the letter <i>bet</i> – [only] through it does it become possible to constrain the letter <i>aleph</i> so that it can also be in the Torah. For after the letter <i>bet</i> in <i>bereshit</i> we find several <i>aleph</i>s, in the word <i>bereshit</i> and in the words <i>bara elohim</i>, once it was constrained by the letter bet. And that is [the meaning of] <i>Come</i> [בא] <i>to Pharaoh</i>, which is to say through the <i>bet</i> the <i>aleph</i> will be in the Torah. And since now the Torah is in exile, therefore <i>I have hardened his heart and [the heart of his servants]</i> (Ex. 10:1) so that Israel will serve <i>in mortar and in brick</i> (Ex. 1:14) to bring the Torah out of exile. And as is stated in <i>Tikkunei Zohar</i>, “<i>… in mortar</i> [<i>be-<u>h</u>omer</i>] (Ex. 1:13-14), that is [the logical argument of] ‘…and certainly…’ [<i>kal ve-<u>h</u>omer</i>],” as we said above – through this they brought [the argument of] “…and certainly…” out of the exile, and so on for the other servitudes. And that is [the meaning of] <i>that I may show these signs</i> [<i>otot</i>] <i>of mine among them</i> (Ex. 10:1), that the letters [<i>otiot</i>], which belong to the Torah, must be taken out of exile. And the verse concludes, <i>that you may tell … how I have toyed</i> (Ex. 10:2), which is to say that I made Myself small since the Awareness was in smallness.  And now <i>you may know</i> (Ex. 10:2), as was stated above.

Beshalach











<i>Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, [and the people shall go out] and gather a day's portion every day</i> (Ex. 16:4). Now, the Torah is eternal since “Torah and the Holy Blessed One are one” (Zohar 1:24a), and it needs to be limitless in past, present, and future; but how is this relevant to every person and every time?
The matter is that when Israel was in Egypt, the iron furnace, they were so clarified that after fifty days they were able to receive the Torah because of their bodies’ clarification. And because of this the Sea of Reeds needed to split for them so they could walk through the sea; this needed to be the order so that they could clarify more and more to the point that afterward, at the Giving of the Torah, our Sages of Blessed Memory said that their impurity ceased (Shabbat 146a). And they continued clarifying in this way, that the materiality continually diminished to the point that after the splitting of the Sea of Reeds they had clarified so much to the extent that they could receive Upper Life-Force without any garment, because of the clarification of their physical materiality. For the abundance flows from above according to the thickness or thinness of the recipient. And the life-force that comes from above is drawn by way of the speech that is fixed in a person’s mouth, as is known. Therefore immediately after the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, the passage of manna is stated, <i>and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day</i>, that each person received Upper Life-Force without any garment, just <i>Man eating the bread of the angels</i> (Psalm 78:25). And by way of what will it be drawn? <i>A day's portion</i> [<i>davar</i>] <i>every day</i>, which is to say by way of the words [<i>dibburim</i>] that they speak from day to day in words of Truth and Torah, until after they have returned to their materiality and their physicality has thickened – therefore the flow descends from above garbed in several garments according to the power of the recipients. And if so, even today in the present there is the aspect of “manna,” but it comes by way of garments; for each person, his life-force is garbed in a vessel, each person according to his aspect, meaning the thing from which his sustenance comes. And <i>the wise person has his eyes in his head</i> (Ecclesiastes 2:14) to understand that the Blessed Creator’s life-force is what is garbed in that thing, and [God] has contracted [God’s] self in that thing, and it is merely a vessel for the Upper Life-Force. Therefore Blessed God said to Moses, <i>Take a jar, and put [an omer of manna in it,] and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations</i> (Ex. 16:33), which is to say that since in the coming generations their physicality will thicken until they can only receive the life-force through a vessel – it needs to garb itself in the material vessel according to the recipients. And that is [the meaning of] <i>Take a jar</i>, which is to say a vessel, <i>and put an omer of manna in it</i>,  which is to say manna, the life-force, is garbed within the vessel, which is the jar. And similarly today there is also the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, and afterward the manna comes; for every day we recite the Song of the Sea, and one must imagine in his awareness as if he is reciting the Song at the Sea as in that time. And then it will truly cause the aspect of the splitting of the Sea of Reeds above, as is known, when he recites it with whole intention as is stated regarding this in the Holy Zohar. And afterward he receives life-force as we have said, each according to his aspect. Therefore the <i>Shul<u>h</u>an Arukh</i> wrote, “It is good to recite the passage of Manna” each day (<i>Orah <u>H</u>ayyim</i> 1.5), so that he will know that his sustenance comes from Upper Supervision, and understand this.

Yitro

“At the moment when Israel put <i>we will do</i> before <i>we will listen</i>, a heavenly voice came out and said: ‘Who revealed this secret to my children, the language the ministering angels use?’” etc. (Shabbat 88a).
Now, it is known that there is a world of pleasure, the world of Understanding; and when one speaks the speakings with joy and passion, with Love and Reverence, the pleasure comes to him afterward. For at the beginning he must exert himself in Service, which is his arousal and longing; and this is called “the World to Come,” which is to say that it comes always at the time of Service, whereas the future world is called “the Coming Future” in the Talmud. And “listening” connotes understanding as in the verse, <i>that Joseph understood</i> (Gen. 42:23); for without their needing to exert beforehand, it would not be considered Service, but merely a desire like any desire.
And that is [the meaning of] Israel’s saying <i>we will do and we will listen</i> (Ex. 24:7), which is to say we will do the Service and exert [ourselves]; and afterward we will come to the world of pleasure such that it will be considered Service. “A heavenly voice came out and said, ‘Who revealed this secret… the language the ministering angels [use] etc.” – in truth it is a great thing, for it is even so for the angels: first he must arouse his longing for the Holiness and the life-force from the Blessed Creator.
Or you could say, “At the moment when Israel put [<i>we will do</i> before <i>we will listen</i>, a heavenly voice] said: ‘Who revealed this secret to my children?’”  (Shabbat 88a). And we must understand how it is possible to do before one hears what to do, as well as the basis for Blessed God’s praise, complimenting [Israel] so much because they put <i>we will do</i> before <i>we will listen</i>.
But the truth is that no person is able to stay at one level always, because the life-force ebbs and flows, it comes and goes, meaning that when he is attached to Blessed God he feels life-force and pleasure; and afterward he moves away and falls from his level.  And contained in this are secrets of Torah, the reason why it is necessary to fall from his level; and one reason is so that he can arrive afterward at an even greater level, for in every thing there must be Absence before Presence.  When we want to rise to an even greater level there must be absence beforehand, therefore one must fall from the level at which one currently stands. 
So a person must, even in falling from his level, make an effort to rise up to God in the level at which he now stands; for one must believe that <i>all the earth is full of God’s glory</i> (Isaiah 6:3) and no place is void of Him, and even on the level at which he now stands, Blessed God is also there because no place is void of Him, only He is very contracted.  And this is [the meaning of the verse] <i>From the rising of the sun until it goes down [the LORD’s name is to be praised]</i> (Psalm 113:3), for the <i>tzaddik</i> is called “the sun” as in the teaching, “Before Eli’s sun set, the sun of Samuel the Ramatite had risen etc.” (Yoma 38b),  thus a <i>tzaddik</i> is called the sun.  And this is [the meaning of] <i>From the rising of the sun</i>, which is when one’s mind is clear and pure and attached to Blessed God, <i>until it goes down</i>, which is when the clarity departs and he falls from his level.  But one must always live by <i>the LORD’s name is to be praised</i>, and make an effort to rise up to Blessed God in the level at which he now stands.
And this is called <i>we will do</i> before <i>we will listen</i> – even in our falling from our level, to attach to Blessed God in that level as we have explained above; and afterwards <i>we will listen</i>, since the essence of listening is understanding, meaning that one will come to an even greater level as we have explained above.  And this is the essence of receiving the Torah that Israel received, and therefore Blessed God greatly praised them for this: that they accepted the Torah in the fullness of Truth and comprehended Truth, that they would forever be attached to Blessed God and would not separate from God even when they fell from their level. This is the essence of the Jewish journey and conduct, and this is how a person must walk.  And how can a person come to Blessed God once he has fallen from his level, since his mind-states and Awareness have been taken from him?  But Blessed God, <i>all the earth is full of God’s glory</i>, that is, even in a place that is <i>all the earth</i>, which is entirely materialistic, which is only dense matter, nevertheless it is full of God’s Blessed Glory.  So it is that Blessed God is called the Life of Living, meaning that all the living things in the world, animals, beasts, and birds, and the human species, their life-force is Blessed God.  And this is “Life of Living,” that Blessed God is the life-force of all living things.  And one should think, when one falls from one’s level, “Do I not live?  And who is my life-force?  It is the Blessed Creator!”  And one will find that Blessed God is also here, even though God is very contracted.
And this is what the Holy Blessed One said: “‘Who’ revealed this secret to My children,” which is to say [the question] “Who.”  That is, when they think, “Who is my life-force?” this [question] reveals to them the secret, to put <i>we will do</i> ahead of <i>we will listen</i>, as we have explained above.
And that is [the meaning of the verse] <i>On this day they came into the wilderness of Sinai</i> (Ex. 19:1), which our Sages of Blessed Memory interpreted as “[Torah] should be new for you as on the day when it was given” (Tanhuma, Yitro 13); but how is such a thing possible – was the Torah not given long ago, and how could [Torah] be new like the day it was given? But according to our words above it can be understood well, that in each and every day he puts <i>we will do</i> before <i>we will listen</i>, for this is the essence of receiving the Torah as we have clarified.
And that is [the meaning of the verse] <i>you who are attached to the LORD your God, [you are all alive today]</i> (Deut. 4:4), and we must understand why it is written with both names, <i>to the LORD your God</i>, when it should have said <i>you who are attached to the LORD</i> and no more. And according to our words above we can understand well that <i>God</i> [<i>Elohim</i>] in all contexts connotes judgment and contraction; and that is [the meaning of] <i>you who are attached to the LORD your God</i>, meaning even when He is contracted for you, when you have fallen from your level, nevertheless you are attached to Blessed God by means of [the question], “Is it not the case that <i>you are all alive today</i>? And who is your life-force? It is He, may His Name be Blessed and His Mention Elevated!”
And that is [the meaning of] King David’s statement, peace be upon him, <i>I have set</i> [<i>shiviti</i>] <i>the LORD always opposite me</i> (Psalm 16:8), which is to say that Existence  was the same [<i>shaveh</i>] for me. That is, “When I am attached to Blessed God with clear mind-states” – <i>opposite me</i> connoting opposition – “then when I fall from my level it was all the same for me,” that he was attached to Blessed God even in the moment of his falling. And that is [the meaning of] what King Solomon, peace be upon him, said, <i>Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For it is not from wisdom that you ask this</i> (Ecclesiastes 7:10), which is to say that there are fools who in their falling from their level lie in the dust and do not rise again to Blessed God. And that is [the meaning of] <i>Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these,”</i> meaning that then I served Blessed God and now I have fallen from my level – <i>Do not say</i> such a thing, <i>For it is not from wisdom that you ask this</i>. For Wisdom gives life, and the life-force ebbs and flows, in which case it must be so. And in the Holy Zohar this is called “Arriving and not arriving,” meaning that when he is attached to Blessed God in clarity then it is called “arriving;” but when [the attachment] leaves it is called “not arriving.”
And the reason why he must fall from his level is this: because there are fallen souls; those that fell during the six days of Creation and those that fell in each and every generation. And they are reincarnated, and they are <i>fugitive and wanderer</i> (Gen. 4:12) and can not come to Blessed God because they have nothing through which to come; for in their life of life-force they engaged in this world’s vanities and achieved nothing. But when the <i>tzaddik</i> falls from his level and afterward rises as in the verse, <i>seven times the tzaddik falls and stands</i> (Proverbs 24:16), when he stands and rises up to Blessed God he lifts with him those souls we have mentioned. Now, he can only lift those souls who are from his root; and therefore every person must fall from his level in order to lift up the souls that are from his root, and understand this.

<b>"These are the records of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Pact, etc."</b> For it is known that Torah is the names of the Holy Blessed One.  The Name of the The Blessed One is, "Was, Is, and Will Be - Eternal, Alive, Everlasting for Eternity."  And Torah is also this.  So what does it mean that this was the time that the Tabernacle was made and what does it teach us about the path today?  The Torah should be read in order to teach us to way we should go.  Surely at every time and season the Torah is clothed for the needs of that particular time and season.  There are those who say: God created the world for the sake of the Torah which is called (Proverbs 8:22) “The beginning (ראשית) of His (God’s) way”, and for the sake of Israel who are called (Jeremiah 2:3) “The beginning (ראשית) of His (God’s) increase’."  This is explained by way of a parable: A King who has wise children, capable of running the kingdom bring the King more satisfaction and joy than if he were to run the kingdom himself.  We are the children of the Ever-Present, and this explains the phrase "No good comes to the world except through Israel."  (Israel) makes a path to bring down the abundant flow to the lower realms.  This is "Ascribe might to God, whose majesty is over Israel" (Psalm 68:35)  Israel adds strength to the Entourage of Above, and the Angels do not sing praises above until Israel is singing them below. "When the morning stars sang together and all the divine beings shouted for joy" (Job 38:7).  Israel is likened to the stars, and thus aroused all of the Heavenly beings there.  This is the intention of the Creator that created all that is found because of Torah and because of Israel.  The content of this intention of the Holy Blessed One was that each person of Israel would be a "Tabernacle" of the Holy Blessed One.  As it is written (Exodus 25:8) "Make for me a Sanctuary and I will dwell within them.  Within "it" is not written, rather, I will dwell within the children of Israel.  "The Temple of the Lord, the temple of Lord are these. (Jeremiah 7:4).  But isn't it impossible for a person to be a Tabernacle of Hashem while the Evil Inclination is within a person?  "The couch is too short for stretching out" (Isaiah 28:20). )(Rabbi Yonatan) said: This bed is too short for two counterparts. (Yoma 9b)  Thus it is said "Turn from evil" (Psalm 34:15)  That a person should burn the evil from within him and thus it could be that Hashem Baruch Hu who is called, "The Lord is good to all" (Psalm 145:9) will reside inside of the person.  This happens after a person fulfills "Turn from evil" and thus makes the repair that the "Good of the Lord" will be within you.        “All the end-times have passed, and the matter [now] depends only on <i>teshuvah</i>” (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 97b).   And what is <i>teshuvah</i>?  For when a person was in his mother’s belly, God’s “candle burned over his head, and he saw from one end of the world to the other… and they taught him the entire Torah” (Niddah 30b); for he was a dwelling-place [<i>mishkan</i>] for Blessed God, and this is [the meaning of] the candle that was over his head.  But after he came out of his mother’s belly sin crouches at the door (Gen. 4:7), and an angel comes and slaps him on the mouth and makes him forget so that he will have free will, so he will have reward and punishment. And a person must do <i>teshuvah</i> to bring God back to him as at the beginning.  And this is [the meaning of] <i>Then the LORD your God will turn back to your captives</i> (Deut. 30:3) – it does not say “return,” but rather “turn back to,” meaning that after the <i>teshuvah</i> Blessed God will return to dwell [<i>lishkone</i>] within the person. Now, the essence of <i>teshuvah</i> is abandoning sin with a full heart and regret.  For what is written in the Books, that fasts correct sin, is because it is impossible for him truly to abandon the sin and truly regret until after he has afflicted himself; and then his uncircumcised heart will surrender and he will be able to regret and abandon the sin truly. And the root of the matter lies in the human’s being created by God’s Word.  And he is called “engraving” on account of his being surely hewn in supernal holiness. Now, when a person sins he is made into a corpse; for on account of the sin, Blessed God’s life-force left him.  But after verbal confession, along the lines of <b>(incomplete)</b>*
*The notation חסר ("incomplete") appears in the Hebrew text in all editions.

Vayikra

The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting... There is to understand that the beginning could have only been "And He called" without explaining who was calling, bu after this it's explained "And the Lord spoke to him".  The matter is that Hashem Yitbarach brought us out from Egypt and gave us immediately the commandments of Pesach and circumcision.  After this (God) split for us the sea, and then brought us into the wilderness (under) a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.  After this (God) gave us the Torah and after this commanded us to build the Mishkan as is said (Exodus 25:8) "And let them make Me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them."  In "it" is not written, etc.  As a parable (states): One that was from the world in a dark place and never saw light in his days.  If he were brought out suddenly to the openness of the world, he would not be able to stand the light.  Thus, it's need to show it to him on the level that he can begin.  Make for him a small crack that he can see from there a little light, and after this, widen the crack until it becomes a window, and only then bring him out to the openness of the world and show him the light.  Thus Israel was in Egypt: they were sunk below 50 gates of impurity.  If they were suddenly shown the rays of God's light, they would not have been able to stand it.  Thus they need each level as it were.  And the essence of the purpose (of these levels) was "Make Me a sanctuary, and I will dwell in them"
Our Rabbis taught that One who is walking in a place of danger, recites a brief prayer…at parashat ha’ibur.  It's then explained in the Gemara (Berachot 29b), "Even when they are engaged in sin, may all of their needs before You," The matter is that the Creator Baruch Hu is retracted near/within each person from Israel, and even the most wicked one The Creator Yitbarach is still with him. The proof is that for ever wicked person comes thoughts of Teshuva, which is the Holy Blessed One calling him individually and saying, "Return to Me."  It's only that he does not understand is that it is Hashem Yitbarach is calling him. 
This is why "And He called to Moshe" is written with a diminished Alef.  That Hashem Yitbarach is "Aluf (Master) of the world.  Go retracts Himself within every person of Israel and calls him to return.  These are the thoughts of Teshuva that come to him.  But a person does not understand that it is Hashem Yitbarach calling him.  This is why it's not only written "And He Called""  But when he comes to understand that Hashem Yitbarach is calling him to return from his wicked ways, and he returns himself to the Boreh Yitbarach, only then "the Lord spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting saying," This is  that when a person comes to do some sin, but Hakadosh Baruch Hu prevents him by way of some reason that he can't actually commit the sin, this is likened to God saying to him "Return to Me! How long will you go after your emptiness!" This is what our Rabbis z'l meant when they said "Pray a shortened prayer" To shorten the "husks".  Save Hashem, Your people, etc." Even when they are engaged in sins, etc. This is what our Rabbis z''l meant when they said "After HaKadosh Baruch Hu held Jeroboam, saying "Return to yourself!"  In the hour that he was rebelling and standing to offer idolatrous sacrifices, the prophet rebuked him and wanted to strike him.  His hand dried up and he could not perform idol worship.  This what God meant when He said "Return to yourself" That in this he was prevented from it."

...[The prohibition of] Chametz on Passover is any quantity, because holiness is called "matzah" and the husk is called "chametz". And there is no difference between them save for a little quantity which is the difference between the "chet" and the "hey". Furthermore, notice that the "hey" and the "chet" are interchangeable according to alef-chet-hey-ayin. And the issue is that one does not find the impulse to do evil trying to divert someone with an obvious and known transgression, because if it were to do that, who would listen?! Rather, it makes the action look like a mitzvah, exchanging the "chet" by a "hey". And this is why our sages of blessed memory said "one who comes to become ritually pure they help her/him, one who comes to become ritually impure they open for her/him" (Shabbat 104a) and on a first glance this is not simple to understand, it appears that they do something in order that the one that comes to become impure to become impure! But here is the explanation: one who comes to become impure the impulse to do evil makes the action look like a mitzvah, and exchanges the "chet" for a "hey". "They open for him" the "hey" which has an opening at the top. 

The fire on the altar shall be kept burning, not to go out, etc.: And the idea is that Adam, the first man, saw from one end of the world to the other with the light of the six days of creation. But after he sinned, the light disappeared; that is He hid for the righteous in the future to come. As in the beginning, before the sin, the light was revealed; whereas after the sin, it was clothed in the garments with which He clothed the light. That is that the light is clothed within the Torah. And this is [the meaning of]: <i>And the Lord, etc. made garments of skins [or]</i> (Genesis 3:21). But in Rabbi Meir's Torah, it was written, garments of light [<i>ohr</i>], with an <i>aleph</i>. Yet that is difficult: Is it not that if an <i>aleph</i> replaces an <i>ayin</i>, the Torah is disqualified? So either way — either our Torah is disqualified, or Rabbi Meir's Torah is disqualified. But it can be said it is since Rabbi Meir's name was Nehorai [giver of light], as he would enlighten the eyes of the sages about the law. That is that the Torah that Rabbi Meir wrote by way of a scribe was written with an <i>ayin</i> [<i>or</i>], like our Torah. However Rabbi Meir's Torah is that which he taught the people of his generation and enlightened their eyes. This means that he taught them how to arrive at the hidden light within the Torah. For since it is clothed in garments, not everyone is able to arrive at the hidden light. So Rabbi Meir would teach the people of his generation and enlighten their eyes to [know how] to arrive at the hidden light.

Metzora

<i>This shall be the Torah concerning the one struck with skin blanch</i> [<i>metzora</i>] <i>on the day he becomes clean.  He shall be brought to the priest</i> (Lev. 14:2), and our Sages of Blessed Memory interpreted <i>metzora</i> as one who speaks evil [<i>motzi ra</i>], for afflictions come through the sin of evil speech.  But the matter is according to what is written, <i>When God began to create</i> etc. (Gen. 1:1), and our Sages of Blessed Memory interpreted: “For the sake of Torah and for the sake of Israel” (cf. Rashi, ad. loc.); so we find that Israel is something very important to Blessed God, since for their sake all of the Worlds and all the Creations were created.  And Blessed God takes pleasure from each one of Israel, even from a greatly wicked person: “<i>Your temples</i> [<i>rakatekh</i>] <i>are like a pomegranate</i> (Song of Songs 6:7) – even the empty ones [<i>reykanim</i>] among you are as full of <i>mitzvot</i> as a pomegranate” (Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 57a).  And when a person speaks evil about one of Israel, even if he speaks truth, he nullifies the Blessed Creator’s pleasure (if it were possible) and causes Him sadness (if it were possible) as is stated, <i>[And the Lord …] was saddened in to His heart</i> (Gen. 6:6), and inverts the pleasure [<i>oneg</i>] into affliction [<i>nega</i>]; therefore his “wage” is measure for measure, affliction comes upon him. And our Sages of Blessed Memory said: “Evil speech is as great as idolatry, sexual immorality, and murder” (Babylonian Talmud, Arakhin 15b).  But we must be precise: what connection does idolatry have to evil speech?  But the matter is according to what is written, <i>By the word of ADONAI were the heavens made</i> (Psalm 33:6), that all of the Worlds and all of the Creations were created through speech comprised of the 22 letters of the Torah, which is called Heavenly Sovereignty.  For when the Sovereign does not speak, no one knows how to do His Will; and when he speaks His Will is revealed, and that is Heavenly Sovereignty whose Sovereignty is in all jurisdictions.  And we find in <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> that [the letters] are established in the mouth, that Blessed God established the 22 letters: the World of Speech, Heavenly Sovereignty, the Attribute of ADONAI-ness, <i>ADONAI, open my lips<i> (Psalm 51:17), were established in the human mouth.</i></i>
So it is that Blessed God does not speak evil about Israel like the father does not speak [evil] about his son; so we find that when a person speaks evil he presents himself as someone who deny that his words are Heavenly Sovereignty, the Attribute of ADONAI-ness, and therefore he is like one who worships idolatry.  And this is the statement of King David, peace be upon him, <i>[May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaks proud things!] Who have said: “Our tongue will we make mighty”</i> (Psalm 12:5), which is to say that the wicked say “Let us make our tongues mighty to speak because our lips are ours, who is a Lord over us?”  Which is to say they deny that the ADONAI-ness is in their mouths.  But one must have faith that his speech is Heavenly Sovereignty; and this is the statement of [our Sages] of Blessed Memory, “Who rules over me? The <i>tzaddik</i>!” (Babylonian Talmud, Moed Katan 16b), which is to say “The <i>tzaddik</i> rules with me, with My speech, which is Heavenly Sovereignty, ruling over all the Worlds and all the Creations.”  And how do we arrive at this faith?  It is through engaging in the Torah, meaning when a person speaks words of Torah and connects his speech to the letters of the Torah, through that he brings about Heavenly Sovereignty. So it is that we find a disagreement in [Babylonian Talmud] Arakhin 15b, “One says that a person who told [evil speech] has no remedy, and one said he should engage in Torah as is stated, <i>the Tree of Life heals the tongue</i> (Proverbs 15:4).”  And yet they certainly do not disagree, for this is a principle in all of Torah: “These and these are the words of the Living God” (Babylonian Talmud, Eruvin 14a), so too here when a person engages in Torah not for its own sake he has no remedy, but when he engages [in Torah] for its own sake and connects his speech to the letters of the Torah he thereby brings about Heavenly Sovereignty; and this is [the meaning of] <i>the Tree of Life heals the tongue</i>.
And this is [the meaning of] <i>This shall be the Torah concerning the one struck with skin blanch</i> [<i>metzora</i>], which is to say the Torah and learning of the one who speaks evil [<i>motzi ra</i>] <i>on the day he becomes clean</i> will be in order to elevate and connect his speech, which is Heavenly Sovereignty, called <i>this</i>, to connect with the Torah; and then <i>He shall be brought to the priest</i>, which is to say to Blessed God who is called “Priest.”

Achrei Mot


<b>Were not Your Torah my delight, then I would have perished in my poverty:</b> When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe (Exodus 28:1), "Now you shall bring forward your brother Aharon," it was difficult for him. [Hence] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, "The Torah was mine and I gave it to you. For were it not for it, I would have destroyed My world." To here is the language of the Midrash. The idea is that it is written (Leviticus 16:3), "after the death of the two sons of Aharon, when they came near before the Lord, and died; Speak to Aharon your brother, that he come not at all times into the holy, etc. With this (<i>Bezot</i>) shall Aharon come into the holy." For through their perfect service and righteousness, Nadav and Avihu had perfected their spirits and gave themselves over to death in their attachment, with an amazing attachment, to the point that their souls remained attached to the Supernal Light in the secret of the feminine waters. So their souls departed like one. And this is [the meaning of], "when they came near before the Lord, and died": That they came so close and attached themselves with so much attachment  and great desire to the point that their souls were stored away and attached above. It is true that one who serves with such a service of amazing attachment also brings down a flow of life from above upon himself while he is living, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 4:4), "and you that are attached to the Lord, your God, are all living today." On account of the attachment, life is added; for that is His will, may He be blessed, who gives life to the living. Nevertheless, since they had an obstructing sin - according to the words of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, when they said they were drunk, etc.; or they instructed the law, etc. - the bringing down of that flow was prevented from them in the light coming back to them, such that their souls remained attached there in the secret of the feminine waters. Hence he warned Aharon and said [that] "he come not at all [times], etc." This means to say that truly all of the service of the righteous must be in this way, to give up their lives in the secret of the feminine waters. And that is [the meaning of] "that he come not at all times." For it is impossible "to come at all times to the holy," but rather "With this shall he come, etc." - with this aspect of his sons who were in the secret of the feminine waters. However not in the way that his sons died and remained stored away there, bur rather to increase the the flow of life and holiness upon him through this. And that is [the meaning of] "so that he not die" - in the way that his sons died. And that is why when the Holy One, blessed be He told our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, "among My close one will I be sanctified," he said, "I thought He would sanctify the Temple either through me or through you." For he had a longing to be in the secret of the feminine waters. However this was not how the Holy One, blessed be He, placed him. As it is known that the main arousal must be from the lower towards the above, the secret of the female towards the male, as it is written (Genesis 3:16), "and your desire  will be towards your husband." However our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, is called the husband of the matron. Hence he is in the secret of the male. And it is only possible for the desire for one's elevation in the secret of the feminine waters be from the lower levels that are called the poor. They need to desire and elevate themselves and be aroused like a female towards the male. Yet Moshe, to whom the Torah was given - and it is called the Torah of Moshe - is in the secret of the male, the husband of the matron. If he had elevated himself in the secret of the feminine waters, the poor levels would have been lost and would not have elevated themselves. For they are as nothing in comparison to him. And that is why when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, "Now you shall bring forward your brother Aharon," Moshe saw that Aharon would also approach his dimension and would be equal to him, and both of them would not be for the dimension of the feminine waters - so it was hard for Moshe. For he thought "It would either be with me or with you." Nevertheless, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, "The Torah was mine and I gave it to you" - you are on the level of Torah, the secret of the male, the husband of the matron. And it is impossible [for you] to rise up to the secret of the delight of the feminine waters which the Holy One, blessed be He, desires. For there is a need for the arousal of the female towards the male. And this is [the meaning of] "Were not Your Torah my delight": For had I not given you the Torah, you would have been my delight. However with the Torah, it is impossible. Since "then I would have perished in my poverty, etc." And it is already know that Pinchas is Eliyahu, and that is the [same soul] as Nadav and Avihu. For they were together in Pinchas, as it is known. It comes out that Eliyahu is the secret of the feminine waters of Nadav and Avihu. And that is why our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 3a) about Rabbi Yosei when he went into a ruin to pray, "Eliyahu came and guarded the entrance for me and waited at the entrance." Meaning to say, that the main prayer of the righteous is to raise their souls through the letters of the secret of the feminine waters, the dimension of Eliyahu. That is [the meaning of], "and Eliyahu came immediately and guarded the entrance for me and waited at the entrance." That is the entrance of the body, which is the mouth and speech. And that is why our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said, "If dogs are playing, Eliyahu is coming to the city." For when the joy and delight from the souls of the righteous arise in the secret of the feminine waters, the dimension of Eliyahu, all of the harsh judgements and accusers are sweetened. And when there is joy in the house of the King, even the house of the army is joyful. And that is why our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said, "If dogs are playing" - those are the accusers and the husks. For among the lowest levels, joy is aroused, and all of the harsh judgements are negated. And that is why Scripture states, "With this shall Aharon come into the holy." It means to say, with the feminine waters, the secret of Eliyahu, who is the dimension of Nadav and Avihu. With this one must approach the holy.

<i>And Adonai spoke to Moses, saying: “Lift up the head of the children of Gershon, them as well, by their fathers’ house [by their families]</i> etc. (Num. 4:21-22).  And we must understand what is meant by <i>saying</i>: it presents no problem with respect to <i>mitzvot</i>, since it makes sense to say that the explanation is that Moses should <i>say</i> to Israel; but here, [God’s instruction] is for Moses alone!  And furthermore the Torah is eternal and relevant in every time, for otherwise it would be, God forbid, merely stories from past times; and if that were the case why would it be called “Torah” which connotes Instruction and Guidance [<i>hora’at derekh</i>], since it instructs [<i>morah</i>] and teaches us the way of God — but what Instruction and Guidance is here? But it is written, <i>attach to Him</i> (Deut. 11:22), which our Sages of Blessed Memory interpreted: “How is it possible to attach to Blessed God, when He is a Consuming Fire?” and it is written in the Holy Zohar, “A Fire which consumes all the fires in the world” (III:62a); and if so, how is it possible for Flesh and Blood to attach to such a God?  Rather, [the verse means] attach to God’s attributes: just as He is merciful, so you should be merciful, etc. (cf. Rashi, loc. cit.).  And we must understand: How does this answer his question?  While it is true that a person could attach to God’s attributes, in the verse it says, <i>attach to <b>Him</b></i>!  But in truth the answer is that Blessed God gave us the Torah so a person would be able to attach to Blessed God; for how [else] would it be possible for a person who is bounded and limited to attach to Blessed God, who is without limit, since He has no beginning and no end?  Therefore Blessed God gave us the Torah and contracted himself (as if it were possible) into our Holy Torah so that in his  attaching to the Torah, it happens that he is attached to Blessed God who dwells within the Torah.  And this is the statement of our Sages of Blessed Memory, “Attach to God’s attributes,” meaning to the Torah; for the Torah is interpreted through thirteen [methodological] attributes, such as “from one premise to another,” “from a similar phrase,” etc.,1 and these are precisely the thirteen attributes [of God], “merciful and compassionate” etc.  So when a person attaches to the Torah he attaches to Blessed God who dwells within the Torah. And so according to this it would be very easy for a person to attach to Blessed God, meaning through his attaching to the letters of the Torah and Prayer which are the Capabilities of the Blessed Creator who dwells within them; but there are Foreign Thoughts which come and confuse him at the time when he is engaged in Torah and Prayer.  So what can one do about this?  One must ask the advice of the Torah, since the Torah gives us advice about this.  For a person must understand the matter of the Foreign Thoughts: are they not Letters which have fallen?  For no thought could exist without Letters, and the Foreign Thoughts are also Letters, but they have fallen because of his own actions.  And therefore when he comes to attach to Blessed God, they also come so that he can elevate them.  But a Foreign Thought does not come, God forbid, to confuse him, and he must elevate them to their Root. And this is what the Torah tells us in pleasant words: <i>Lift up the head</i>, which is to say that your should lift up and elevate א"ת, which are the twenty-two letters from <i>aleph</i> to <i>tav</i>; elevate them to the Head and the First who is the Blessed Creator.  For all the words of the Torah and Prayer, they are all combinations of Letters: when you join together <i>vav-yud-dalet-bet-resh</i> it makes the word <i>vayedaber</i>; all the words are all combinations of Letters and one must elevate the Letters to their Roots.  And if you do this then <i>the children of Gershon</i>, the Letters which fell and were banished [<i>nitgarshu</i>], <i>they too</i> will rise <i>to their fathers’ house</i>, they being Abraham who was the attribute of Mercy and Love; and the Fear of Isaac, who was the attribute of Reverence; and <i>Israel, in whom I will be glorified</i> (Isaiah 49:3) who was the attribute of Glory.  That is, when a person leans and prays with Reverence and Love in order to Glorify his Creator by the Name of His Glorious Sovereignty, then the Letters go up there Above to the Fathers as has been explained.  <i>To their families</i>, to their Attachments as in <i>put me, please</i> (1 Sam. 2:36).  But how does one do all this?  King Solomon, peace be upon him, explained it as <i>Whatever your hand is capable of doing</i> (Ecclesiastes 9:10) which is to say in whatever way you want to do Blessed God’s Will, do it with strength, you must <i>do it with strength</i>; meaning that when you put all your strength and your life-force into the Letters of the Torah and Prayer, through this you will elevate them to their Root, to the Blessed Creator.

Pinchas

<i>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Pinhas the son of Eleazar… [has settled my wrath…] Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace”</i> (Num. 25:10-12), and the Sages of Blessed Memory, in the Talmud (Zevachim 101b) interpreted that Pinhas only became a priest after he had killed Zimri.  We must understand the phrasing of <i>saying</i>, which must be to Israel since the statement to Pinhas is stated explicitly in the verse, <i>Therefore say (to him), ‘Behold, I give to him’</i> etc. – but what was the statement to Israel? We must also understand the phrasing of <i>settled</i> rather than saying “removed” <i>my wrath<i> etc.</i></i>

To understand the matter further, we will precede it with the <i>mishnah</i> from <i>Pirkei Avot 5:1</i>: “The world was created through ten statements, and what does that mean to teach… except to collect from the wicked etc.”  We must understand the fact that the world was created through ten statements in order to augment the punishment of the wicked, who destroy a world as great as this that was created through ten statements – which makes no sense since the world could have been created through a single statement; it is inconceivable that the Blessed Creator, who is a faithful God without wrongdoing, would create us through ten statements in order to augment the punishment of the wicked.






But through this you can understand what they said, “<i>The tzaddik rules [through] reverence for God</i> (2 Sam. 23:3) … [I rule over humans, but] who rules over Me? The <i>tzaddik</i>, [for I make a decree but he annuls it]” (Moed Katan 16b). For at the hands of the wicked the world collapses and remains in contraction and judgment, God forbid; but at the hands of the <i>tzaddikim</i> the king’s anger is settled, as if it were possible. This can be compared to the child of a king, who when he enters into his father’s [presence] – even at the time of his anger – since the king’s will is to draw very close to his precious child, the characteristic of love is awakened within [the king] toward his child; and then that characteristic expands to all those who are in the king’s gate as well. So it is at the hands of the <i>tzaddikim</i>, who bring themselves closer – along with all things – to their Father in Heaven, giving [God] a restful spirit: [God’s] mind settles, as if it were possible, and the judgments that were awakened at the hands of the wicked are sweetened. And that is [the meaning of] “to collect from the wicked, who destroy [a world created] through ten statements” – for even though the Creation happened through ten statements for their benefit, in order that even there in their lowly place they should be able to hold onto [God’s] characteristics, and similarly [God’s] characteristics and divinity were contracted for them in order that they should recognize [God’s characteristics], as was stated above – and even still, on the contrary, on account of [all] this they distance themselves further. “And to give good reward to the <i>tzaddikim</i>, who sustain a world created through ten statements” – as we have stated above, by way of [the world] being created through ten statements, through contraction; for without this it would not have been possible, and understand this.
Now, through the act of Zimri at Shittim, Israel began to whore after the daughters of Moab; and they seized the Blessed Creator’s characteristic, the characteristic of love, and through this distanced themselves from Blessed [God] – whereas on the contrary, through this they could have drawn themselves closer. But they remained in contraction, a place where the Upper Love was contracted, and they drew it down to a place of the judgments and the contraction; and therefore the punishment, God save us, came upon them, wherein twenty-four thousand Israelites died. But Pinhas, on account of his holding onto the Omnipresent’s zealousness, upheld and established the characteristic of mercy [<i>hesed</i>],  which the wicked had cast down; and therefore he deserved to be a priest. And that is [the meaning of] <i>settled my wrath</i> – from the idiom of <i>settling the soul</i> (Psalm 19:8), [meaning] that Pinhas settled [God’s] spirit, as if it were possible, as we have stated above, through the beloved child at whose hands the judgments are sweetened and absorbed into mercy. And therefore <i>it shall be to him and to his descendants after him the covenant of a perpetual priesthood</i> (Num 25:13), and therefore Pinhas only became a priest after he killed Zimri, for then he held onto and established the characteristic of mercy; and understand this, blessed is God forever, amen and amen.

<i>When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof</i> etc. (Deut. 22:8).  Now, it is stated in the Talmud of [Tractate] Gittin (7a): “He sent to Mar Ookva, ‘People are attacking...’ he drew lines and wrote to him, ‘<i>Be still before the LORD</i> and he will cast them down before you like so many corpses.’” The meaning is that when people sometimes afflict a certain person, it is because of the judgments against him Above; and [the judgments] clothe themselves in people Below to afflict him as is said about the verse, <i>The LORD is on my side as my helper; I shall see through those who hate me</i> (Ps. 118:7).  The explanation: the fact that the judgments clothe themselves Below in people is helpful, since through this he can see what is also the case Above; which is to say, <i>I shall see</i> Above <i>through those who hate me</i>, meaning through the haters below. And the correction for this is to raise himself to the aspect of the world of Thought.  For there [in the world of Thought] are no judgments, as is written, <i>evil may not dwell with you</i> (Ps. 5:5).  And that means that through his remaining silent and accepting what comes to him, <i>waiting quietly</i> (Lam. 3:26) and elevating his thoughts as is written, <i>Be still before the LORD</i> etc.  The explanation is that a person should elevate the silence, meaning the thought, to the LORD; and then they will fall like corpses, meaning the judgments will fall through the attachment of his thoughts to the LORD. And just as the roof is the essence of the house, similarly Thought is the essence of a person and shelters over him.  For through Thought a person is preserved and knows how to settle himself as is known; and therefore Thought is called a “roof.”
Now, when a person builds a house it arouses the judgments, particularly outside the Land [of Israel] where it is full of all the emptiness  of the world, as is known, and it constricts their borders.  Therefore the Torah said, <i>When you build a new house, you shall make</i>, which is the idiom of correction, <i>a parapet</i> [<i>ma’akeh</i>] from the idiom of irritations [<i>me’ikim</i>]; the things that irritate you will be corrected through your attaching yourself Above to the place of Thought, which is your “roof” as we have said.  And then, if you attach your Thought to the Blessed Creator, then <i>when the one who falls will fall</i> (Deut. 22:8) – as our Sages of Blessed Memory interpreted, he was destined to fall – for the judgments were destined to fall since the six days of Creation as is known; all of which is to say that the judgments will fall away from you, and understand this.

3. As I explained elsewhere, there are 600,000 letters in Torah.  Every Jew has a soul-root connected in one of the letters, each letter corresponding to the unique quality of his soul.  Accordingly, should he dicsonnect himself from Torah, God forbid, then one letter would be lacking from the Torah [thus making the entire Torah deficient].  That person would need to fix the difficiency in order to make it a whole Torah.
Another principle is every one of the 600,000 letter encompasses whole, from beginning to end, since each and every letter contains within it the entire Torah.  Therefore, if even one letter is missing from Torah, it is pasul [lacking the holiness needed for ritual use].  For this reason, every letter is considered to encompass the whole.
