Hakhsharat HaAvrekhim

Tribute

“The righteous will be remembered forever.” (Psalms, 112:6) And here we remember my righteous mother of noble lineage, Mrs. Hana Bracha, zts”l, daughter of Rav Haiim Shmuel HaLevi zts”l, from the town of Hentshin.

She served God with all of her heart and soul, and sacrificed herself to raise her children in the ways of the Torah.
Her pure soul ascended from this world on Friday, erev Shabbat Kodesh, the 7th of Heshvan, in the year 5700.



And also my dear righteous, modest, pious wife of noble lineage, Mrs. Rachel Chaya Miriam, zts”l, daughter of the holy zaddik R. Yerachmial Moshe, zts”l, the Chief Justice of the rabbinical court of Koretz. She was outstanding in her fine behavior, and even learned Torah every day.
She was a merciful mother to the bitter of spirit in general, and for Torah students and Hassidim in particular.


She died in the prime of her life, her pure soul ascending on the Holy Shabbat, on the parsha of “and Miriam died,” the 10th of Tammuz 5697 (1937). 

Introduction

Before the whole community, I thank and praise God in every possible way, the One and only Creator who surrounds all of the worlds and fills all of the worlds,
the Gracious and Merciful, for all of the kindness that He has done for me, my family, all who have joined together with us, and for all of Israel, in this world and in the world above. May God continue to be merciful with us even though we are not worthy, and continue to be gracious with us in this world and in the world above, with revealed kindness, with good salvations and with consolations. May He grant us the merit of the complete Redemption and the light of the Messiah, with generosity and kindness. 
And similarly I thank and praise God that in his great mercies has granted me the merit to complete a new publication, for the portion of Jacob and distribution among Israel. We have already seen from the first edition how much this has inspired so many Jews in their study of the Torah and service of God, bringing the nefesh, ruach, and neshama of the man of Israel closer to God, may He be blessed.  So in the merit of bringing our brethren closer to God, may God be kind and merciful with us to bring us and all of Israel ever closer to His purity, holiness, Torah, and divine service, whether in this world or in the upper world. And may it be done so with Simcha, generosity, with the pleasantness of the love and fear of God, and the salvation of all of Israel. 
I was asked to make additions to the new edition, as “there is no beit Midrash without new Torah innovations,” (Hagiga, 3, meaning no matter how much you learn a matter of Torah each time you can find a new idea in it.) So I have done so here in the Hacharat HaAvreichim. My previous book instructs young people in Torah and Avoda, where this new book is geared to the obligations of the Avreich, (meaning Torah students in their late teens or twenties, or newly married yeshiva students.) As it will take a long time and much hard work to complete the full edition, we now provide a pamphlet that will present these teachings about how to come closer to God in the way of Chassidus. (Clearly the Rebbe zts”l is not referring to the complete Hacharat HaAvreichim that is before you.) Now we ask that only those who have previously learned the Hovot HaTalmidim and the three Ma’amarim on Shabbat are to continue and learn the Hachsharat haAvreichim. 





Chapter 1

<b>The preparation of the <i>Avreichim</i></b><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">See <i>Bereishis</i> (41:43), and Rashi thereon. <i>Avreich</i> generally means a young, newly married yeshiva student.</i><br><big><strong>Getting Started.</strong></big>
We know through our holy <i>sefarim</i> that the ways of divine service of the master kabbalists of Israel, and similarly the ways of the Chassidim who followed the path taught by the Baal Shem Tov and his students, were none other than the ways practiced by the prophets of God. It is written in the Zohar (<i>Terumah</i>, 154a) that Rabbi Yaakov asked himself, “Who granted me this awakening of divine inspiration which allows me to be counted among the faithful prophets in the fellowship of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, before whom the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth tremble?” With sincere humility, Rabbi Yaakov was amazed that he was worthy of being associated with such a league of prophets.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">That is to say, that Rabbi Shimon and his fellowship, who lived in the second century of the cCommon eEra, were on the level of prophets such as Chaggai, Zecharia, and Malachi, who lived six centuries earlier in the beginning of the time of the Great Assembly. You may question the opening thesis of the holy Piasesner by noting that the power of prophecy had left the world in the time of the Great Assembly. Furthermore, there is a difference between prophets and sages, and between prophets and masters of Kabbalah. And you may add that Gemara tells us that a sage is preferable to a prophet. And after all, each generation is different, and we know that there the level of greatness descends to the point where if we say the sages, not to mention the prophets, were like men, then we are like donkeys, but definitely not on the level of the donkey of Rav Pinchas ben Yair who kept kosher. All of this notwithstanding, a tradition of <i>avodas Hashem</i> (spiritual practice) is given over from generation to generation, and the inheritors of the tradition, from Avraham Avinu to Moshe Rabeynu to the prophet Malachi to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. No one would deny that the times have changed, to this very day it is in fact an uninterrupted tradition. A prophet is a vessel which receives the revelation of God, and a conduit for the revelation of God’s message. Yet it happens only in the context of the <i>mesorah</i> – the flow and transmission of Torah from master to disciple. Though it waxes and wanes as a result of how God wills that the Divine revelation needs to be granted unto each generation, it invariably remains the same mesorah, as the Torah is for all generations. Kabbalah means, “receiving.” The Piasesner Rebbe zts”l Hy”d is saying with simple elegance that though the prophets and the kabbalists of the Zohar may have received the Divine revelation at different levels of intensity, still, they obviously followed the same Torah in the context of the same transmission. And a central facet of this transmission was in fact the specific practices employed in order to learn to connect to God, even know Him, and receive His wisdom and message. Simply put, they used the same ways. (For more on the subject of mesorah and Kabbalah in the context of generational transmission, see the Introduction to the Beis Yaakov by Rav Gershon Chenoch of Radzin, zts”l trans. B. Edwards.)</i> We also find mentioned<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Parashos Vayigash</i> and <i>Re’eh</i>.</i> in the <b><i>Maor Va’Shemesh</i></b><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Kalonymus Kalman Epstein, (d. 1823), student of the Seer of Lublin, and Reb Elimelech of Lizhensk.</i> that the Tsaddikim (righteous) of every generation who follow the ways taught by the Baal Shem Tov are in essence serving God in the way of the prophets.
The holy Prophets in the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">From Abraham until Zecharia in the second century, BCE.</i> the sages of the Zohar,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar, second Century Israel.</i> the Ari”zal,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">1534 - 1572, Tsfat, Israel.</i> the Baal Shem Tov <sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">1700 – 1760, Ukraine.</i> and his students, they were all like angels of God, exalted beyond us! And their way, the holy path to heaven, is too wondrous for us! We would not make the audacious claim that we can reach their level of sanctity, for they were like God’s own seraphim. But still, we yearn to emulate their ways, and we are also under obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">We promised God at mount Sinai to serve Him with complete devotion. The Rebbe Zts’L clearly implies that, yes, Torah observance is an obligation, but the path of Chassidim is exemplified by those who serve with joy and vigor. This book is a kind of manual of divine service, and its fourteen chapters are all a way of answering the question, “what is a Chassid and how does he serve Hashem?”</i> to serve the God of Avraham, God of Yitschak, and God of Yaakov with a perfect and complete devotion, with every fiber of our bodies and every spark of our souls. May God take pity on us and not allow us to leave the state of being in His sanctity, which fills us and surrounds us.
It is not enough for us to be like a slave, son of a slave-woman, who indeed serves the king, yet his service is in the fields or at the millstone, far away from the company of the king. He does not hear the king’s words or delight in his presence. Such service is perfunctory, without thinking or feeling. Our desire and yearning is to be on the level of a son, “for you are sons to the Lord your God.” In this way one feels himself coming close to God through divine service, whether through study, prayer, or the fulfillment of mitzvos. We seek to serve God with the joy of a son who is reunited with his father after not seeing him for many years — elated and moved to be with him again after missing him so strongly and for so long. It is in this same way that we also yearn for God. It is written in the Zohar (Truma, 128b), “How do you know when the Holy One, blessed be He, desires a person and caused the Divine presence to dwell with him? When you see a person whose greatest desire is to run after the knowledge of God and struggles to serve Him with all his heart and all his soul, then you can know for certain that God’s presence rests on that person.” In other words, only one who runs after God with his whole heart and soul, serving Him with all his desire, is truly deemed as being close to God. Such a person can make himself into a dwelling place for the <i>Shechinah</i>.
At the time of our service we may feel our souls running towards God, like the reunion of the father and the son mentioned above. He longs for his father day and night, seeking him, his heart melts, our soul melts as it is poured out before our father in Heaven. It is not only at the time we are involved in prayer and divine service that we feel that we are coming close to God, rather it were well to be so close at all times. If a person leads a humdrum existence, where his soul is, so to speak, buried away under the carpet, then his prayer and divine service will also be routine. If he does not constantly take care of his soul and desire God, then he will not find inspiration when he turns to pray or engage in any holy endeavor. All day he must be a <i>Yehudi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A “Yehudi,” is a holy, self-actualized Jew.</i> striving to be close to God. At times more, and at times less, but he is always a <i>Yehudi</i>, and he will always be on the level of a son to God. All his actions may be imbued with soul to the point where even his thoughts are always pure and strong - connected to God’s sanctity. Then he will reach a level where the soul overpowers his senses. In our service, it is not enough to bar our senses from confusing and seducing our thoughts, saying to us, “you see the world, and you feel real physical senses,” but rather our senses shall be subdued before our thoughts. Then our senses will feel the sanctity of God spread over all existence, and man will know and see in his very life how he lives in God’s garden of Eden before the throne of His glory, may He be blessed. How else may we merit such a complete service unless we are drawn, even slightly, after God’s knowledge on the heels of the Prophets, Kabbalists, and Tsaddikim among the Hasidim! “Follow after the hoofprints of the flock!” (<i>Shir HaShirim</i> 1:8). At least we will see the footprints of their <i>kedushah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Kedushah = Holiness</i> , and our wrestling will kick up the dust on the path of God.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">A play on words, When Yaakov wrestled with the angel, the word for wrestling “misavek” is etymologically connected to the word for dust, “avak,” as if to say, when two people wrestle they kick up the dust with their movements. It is with this struggle that Yaakov received the name Israel, which has the connotation of, “one who wrestles with God.” Dust is also a symbol of meekness, as Abraham said, “What am I but dust and ashes.” So when one subdues himself before the great spiritual masters of Israel and struggles to follow their ways, he is then truly on the way to a complete service of God which transforms his consciousness to one of feeling the Divine presence in all walks of his life.</i> Then the path and the sensation of God’s presence will truly be internalized. Now we need to examine the great reward reserved for this holy enterprise,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Again multiple meanings are implied in the author’s word choice. “Mahu Ekev” could be, “what is the purpose (what are the ends),” “what is the reward,” and even, “what is the heel” (reminiscent of the heels of the wrestlers, as well as Yaakov, who was holding onto his brother Eisav’s heel as he emerged after him at birth.) There are abundant homiletical explanations for the word, “ekev,” in Chasidic writings. See Psalm 19:12, “in keeping them is a great reward.”</i> and the proper training that the aspiring young man who yearns to be a <i>Chasid</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A Hasid, literally “pious one,” loosely means someone who is a member of a community of Orthodox Jews which espouses the practices and flavor of the Divine service upheld and taught by the Baal Shem Tov and his students.</i> must undergo in order to achieve this goal.
Godly people first emerged into the history of the world with the advent of Jewish souls.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">With Avraham Avinu., who was called, “<i>ha’ivri</i>,” which is the root of the word, “Hebrew.”</i> The Jewish soul is called, “a Godly portion from on high,”<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">This verse (Iyov, 31:2), said by Iyov, is classically interpreted as his complaint, saying, perhaps with sarcasm, “look at the portion God has given me for all my good behavior, my house ruined, my children killed, and here I sit scratching my sores on a dunghill.” So it is interesting that in all of the cases I have reviewed in Chassidic writings it takes on the novel positive meaning that the soul of the Jew is a veritable portion of God. This is akin to the verse found near the end of the Torah (Devarim, 32:9), “God’s portion is His people,” which is interpreted to mean that the Jewish soul is connected to God.</i> which rests among the Israelites, was revealed unto them, and prepares them to be a Chariot for the great and lofty revelation of Godliness that they merit through holy efforts. In the introduction to his work Shaarei Kedusha (Gates of Holiness) Rabbi Chaim Vital<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Chaim Vital, one of the greatest Kabbalists and the chief disciple of the Ari”zal, 1542-1620.</i> writes, “When the soul is itself greatly refined, it becomes revealed to man, and it shall lead him in all his ways.” That is to say, it is possible to be a Tsaddik who merits neither prophecy nor divine inspiration (Ruach HaKodesh),<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Prophecy presumably ended around the sixth century BCE, between the time of the destruction of the first temple (586) and its rebuilding under Ezra’s leadership. The Talmud records (Baba Batra, 12b) that after the destruction of the Temple, the power of prophecy was taken from the prophets and given over to children and fools (or madmen).”</i> but indeed manages to achieve the level of feeling and knowing his own soul. This in itself is an admirable level which will lead him on his own way to knowing God.
Knowing this, the young man and the wise student who desires to prepare himself to be a true <i>Chasid</i> must be careful to not to merely perform all of the Torah’s commandments from both Biblical and Rabbinic law in all of their detail, as well as all of the holy customs and spiritual practices of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">In a certain respect, Legal authorities equate Jewish customs with Rabbinic law, as it is said, “<i>minhag yisrael halacha</i>.”</i> If he wants to be a true <i>Chassid</i>, he has to go beyond the letter of the law. That is to say, one could go beyond the letter of the law in the way of a mere religious action or intellectual exercise. The <i>Chassid</i> must do more. He has to imbue his venture beyond the letter of the law with soul. If he strives to serve God with soul, he will then experience a revelation of his soul. Then his entire being, meaning his body and all of the levels of his soul<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Kabbalah teaches of five levels of soul, namely nefesh, ruach, neshama, chaya and yechidah, each one greater (higher, deeper) than the next.</i> will serve God, and he can be sure that God will allow him to truly be a <i>Chassid</i>. What is a <i>Chassid</i>? Rashi tells us in his commentary on the Talmud (Pesachim, 40a), “a <i>baal nefesh</i> (one who through his great vigilance in performing mitzvoth possesses and thereby accesses his soul by entering his soul into his devotion).” The main point of “Chassidus,”<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Chassidus is generally defined as the study of sacred texts written by students of the way of the Baal Shem Tov. But here we see that Chassidus is a state of being and a way of behavior.</i> is for man to sincerely exemplify the characteristics of a, “<i>baal nefesh</i>.”
We have dwelt at length in the book, “A Student’s Obligation,” on how important it is for children and young men to arouse and sensitize their souls in the midst of their religious devotion. But nonetheless, we do not require from every beginner that he immediately succeed in arousing the emblazed <i>hislahavus</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Hislahavus</i> is a state of burning ecstasy, overpowering fervor, that is one of the main characteristics of the path of Chassidic devotion. It comes from the root, “להב – flame,” and when voiced in the intensive form means, “to be burning on fire.”</i> of the great Tsaddikim who burned with passionate love and fear of God in their devotions. Still, beginners should strive to develop passion and a deep feeling for their service, as the verse in the Tehillim enjoins us, “I will go to the house of God with excitement.” We find in the Zohar (1:83b), “Nefesh<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Nefesh means soul, namely, the lowest level of soul.</i> is an awakening from below. It is connected to the body and sustains it … it is united with the body, and cures it. When the nefesh is aroused it then becomes a throne for the Ruach<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Ruach is a higher level of the soul. For the body to be considered alive, it must be united with the nefesh. The nefesh is the fundamental level of life energy. Yet it could be dormant, and a person is still considered physically alive. However, the Zohar is telling us that it is only when the nefesh is awakened and aroused that a person can attain, experience and negotiate the higher level of soul called Ruach (spirit).</i> to rest upon … Once both (the nefesh and the ruach) have been established, man is ready to receive the Neshama (a higher level than the ruach).” This passage in the Zohar must be studied carefully. That is to say, even the weakest awakening of the nefesh that man experiences in his divine service, even the most basic awakening of the vital soul that is so close to the physical body, serves to reveal the nefesh to man’s consciousness. And it does not just wake man up to his nefesh, but also reveals the deeper levels of ruach and neshama.
“All desire to fear Your Name.”<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Slichos liturgy, first night.</i> True, but for many people fear and love of God remain intellectual. They know that it is good and proper to love and revere the Almighty. And to their dismay, even to their distress, they have no real tangible feelings of love and reverence. Even concerning desire, there is a kind of person who knows with absolute clarity that he needs to desire and yearn to lead a pure life for the length of his life. He knows that he needs to constantly connect to God with a revealed soul through Torah, prayer, mitzvoth, and good deeds, all done with purity and holiness. Yet still, he remains on the level of wanting to desire and knowing that it is correct to yearn,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">That is to say, they merely know that it is right to yearn to be truly close to God with love and reverence.</i> without actually feeling any desire or yearning.
We are not just talking about people whose hearts are completely closed, or in other words, those who, experience no excitement whatsoever in their Avodas Hashem, Heaven forfend, and whose soul is like a person covered by a great pile of garbage who can’t so much as raise a finger above it. But we are concerned also with those who are even overcome with desire and excitement many times, yet their Avodah is erratic, so that when they are moved to exert themselves they feel the fire, but when it doesn’t happen of itself they serve without feeling, or even fall from any dedication and action whatsoever. Such people whose service is erratic are not in much of a greater position or in any less danger than the first case of the completely closed-hearted. A person who is not dedicated in actively arousing his soul in his <i>avodah</i> leads a kind of tortured existence. One minute he truly desires and his soul yearns and he brings these feelings into a holy activity, and a minute later he falls, like a drunk rolling around in the garbage, without any desire or excitement for anything holy. And even worse, some fall into destructive fantasies and even act upon them, Heaven forfend, all the while being aware that their thoughts or actions are evil. They may also be aware of the physical and spiritual dangers that they are putting themselves into by wallowing in such a stinking swamp that strangles their souls, drowning in the mire of their thoughts and actions. Such a person may want to desire, want to wake up his soul, and may even say to himself, “How happy I would be if I could wake up even a mere spark of desire and longing in order to save myself from this swamp!” Nonetheless, he cannot do it purely by means his intellect and will. Only a person who is more advanced in the service of God can arouse himself to serve with desire purely through contemplation - even at a time when his being is less involved in holy feelings. The result is even more effective if he deepens his contemplation of the greatness of Hashem as a result of his own love and reverence for the Almighty. And when he spends day and night devoting all his physical power, together with all of his inner potentialities, thoughts, and desires to serving God, he is then endowed with a holy consciousness.
The sages teach us (Bereishis Rabba, 34), “Tsaddikim are in possession of their hearts.” With the converse, God protect us, we see that that their hearts posses them. Everything depends on this. Someone whose heart possesses him and can not completely control his desires is called a “<i>rasha</i>” (evil one). But still, there are precious souls, sweet young men, “<i>Chasidishe Yungelait</i>,” (newly married Chassidic yeshiva students) who have worldly desires and are, “not in possession of their hearts.” But they do battle with their evil inclinations and emerge victorious in that they do not actually fall into sin, God forbid. Furthermore, God sends them an awakening of the divine soul within them and they yearn to be Chasidim, and then at times they bring about the arousal to <i>avodas Hashem</i>. And yet, if they are not in possession of their hearts to the point when they can will the arousal at the time when the thought arises, if they cannot feel excitement at a time when such excitement is warranted, then even they will not reach any great level even if they follow the path of Chasidus. Such students could also be “caught in the sling”<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">“B’caf hakelah.” This means, “in the receptacle of the slingshot.” The metaphor is used because just as the slingshot is wound round and round until the rock is ejected, so does a man whose service is swinging back and forth from unfeeling to fervent risk being ejected from any ability to serve at all.</i> of the erratic religious personality who wavers in his dedication to serving God with soul. Therefore we beg Hashem to allow us to see and to show the angels how man can also have the ability to arouse his desire which then awakens the soul, as the Zohar teaches us. Master of the World! Let us be able to will the arousal at the time when the thought arises, and to feel excitement at a time when such excitement is warranted. I promise you, in the name of the God of Israel Who illuminates their souls, and goes ever before them in a pillar of fire to light His own way so that they may travel by it day and night, that when we provide man with the path and the means with which to willingly shake his soul even in the slightest, even as little as the decision to shake the tips of her feathers, then the student will truly be able to follow the path of Chassidus. Then he will not only remain in this state, but even reach the pinnacle of <i>avodas Hashem</i>, arriving at God’s heavenly chamber with its holy ones, making the Garden of Eden here on earth.

Chapter 2

<big><strong>Ecstasy and Sensitivity. [Hislahavus and Hisragshus.]</strong></big>
In the book, “A Student’s Obligation,” we discussed the great importance of <i>hislahavus</i> (burning ecstasy), and in particular, the soul’s <i>hislahavus</i> during <i>avodas Hashem</i>. It is so important, to the extent that in our generation, we cannot wait for the young man to grow up and get married before we impress upon him the importance of <i>hislahavus</i>. We have dwelt at length regarding children, mostly regarding educating them to serve God with simple and honest devotion, for with a concealed soul and a dry <i>avodah</i> it is impossible to overpower the evil inclination and physical desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">See A Student’s Obligation, Chapter 8.</i> Man can only take control of himself when he rises above his sins (see Bereishis Rabbah, 22) and overcome his nature with a revealed soul. We also discussed the great importance of a higher <i>avodah</i>, and rising to it by means of our holy endeavors in the ways of Chassidus, which allows us to come close to God, (but really we had only just begun to explain this). We had discussed in general the centrality of “waking up,” to God’s presence, yet we did not go into detail in explaining how to such an arousal and reverence can be fostered through specific actions, words, or thoughts. In the current volume of, “the Preparation of the Young Scholar,” — may God have mercy on us to finish it that He may say upon it, “and it was good” — we will enter at length into a development of how through the simple fulfillment of the tenants of Chassidus man is able to take the reigns over his own being. Just as a man has control over his own possessions, and does with them what he wants to, so too may he, with the help of God, gain control over his own essential being, if he only wants to. We will explain how to go on the path of our holy teachers, the masters of the “high road,” of Chassidus, which is akin to the path of the Prophets of old. Each seeker will go only as far as he is able, and according to his particular abilities and limitations. Therefore, we must now explain the nature of this ectasy (<i>hislahavus</i>), and the difference between transcendent ecstasy (<i>hislahavus</i>) and deep feeling (<i>hisragshus</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">From now on, in the hope of beginning to key into the Rabbi Kalonymus Shapira zts’l’s consciousness and wisdom, we will use the original Hebrew terms in transliteration, <i>hislahavus</i> (ecstasy) and <i>hisragshus</i> (excitement).</i> We will explain the nature of the great power of these two states of being, and how the very beginning of the revelation of man’s soul depends on them.
It is written in the Talmud (Berachos 10a): “To whom did David refer in these five verses beginning with ‘Bless the Lord, O my soul’? He was alluding only to the Holy One, blessed be He, and to the soul. Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, fills the whole world, so the soul fills the body. Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, sees, but is not seen, so the soul sees but is not itself seen. Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, sustains the whole world, so does the soul sustain the whole body. Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, is pure, so too is the soul pure. Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, abides in the innermost chambers, so does the soul abide in the innermost chambers. Let that which has these five qualities come and praise Him who has these five qualities.”<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Soncino Translation, with changes.</i>
This teaching from the Talmud requires close study. Even though the Talmud compares the soul to God in five ways, still, there is a great difference between the soul and the Holy One, blessed be He. The main difference is that the soul is, so to speak, grasped within the body, surrounded by it and activated by the actions of the body. Not so with God, who is not confined by anything in the world; the world does not surround Him, to the contrary, He surrounds the universe. God is also not activated by the world, truly the world does not add anything to God, yet it is rather God who activates the world. This is explained in the Zohar (Parshat Pinchas, 258a) and other holy books. Therefore, when we want to describe the heights of the soul, its sublime nature, its unseen qualities, and similarly when we want to discuss the ways in which the soul is revealed, we can explain it in terms of how we conceive of the supernal heights of God, on the one hand, and also in terms of Gods’ revelations in the world, on the other. But it must be initially stressed that not all of the characteristics of the soul can touch the lofty heights of God. The soul can be compared to God in the five ways mentioned in the Talmud (and perhaps in other ways), but man cannot assert, God forbid, that the soul is equated to God in every aspect.
“Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, sees, but is not seen, so the soul sees but is not itself seen.” What reveals the soul? We see that the soul is above, and the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I am called according to my actions.”<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash, Shemos Rabba, 3.</i> God is hidden; far be it for Him to be contained by any name. Even the Holy names that the Torah uses to call God are not God Himself in His essence, as we only use names to identify things that are revealed to us. Yet when God acts in the world, with it He reveals a spark or illumination of His blessed Divinity. We call such an illumination by one of the names of God. E-l is the aspect of<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">A name of God is either the revelation of one of God’s attributes (the Merciful, the Jealous) or a name we use to identify something beyond the power of perception, such as the Eternal, the Infinite, the Transcendent, or the Unknown. God’s essence and transcendence is beyond human perception or the medium of language.</i> God’s benevolence, and E-lohim is the aspect of His strength, and so forth. Depending on the quality of God’s action, we use an appropriate name that expresses that quality. From this we can infer that the soul, which, “sees and is not seen,” is also revealed in actions. The particular action itself, and how it happens is already something completely separate from God, as mentioned above, since the soul itself is activated [by outside forces, unlike God]. In fact, all of God’s works happen ex nihilo, or creation out of absolute non-existence, which is not so with the soul. There are many other differences, but we will only speak concerning the revelation of the soul and its actions in the world.
The soul is initially stimulated by the external world through the five physical senses of sight, hearing, scent, taste, and touch. When a man touches something and knows that it is snow partly because it is cold, it results from the stimulation of his sense of touch. He doesn’t feel the cold in the snow itself, but rather he feels the cold in the nerves of his hand that came in contact with the cold snow. The nerves in his hand are stimulated by the cold. They then send impulses that register in his brain and are sensed by his soul. The colder it gets, the more he feels it and begins to shiver. It is the same with sight. Man’s brain and soul do not see directly that which is external to the body, but rather feel the impression made on his eyes in the form of images. The external world, sights, coldness, and the like, all stimulate his nerves, brain and soul. This is how man perceives the outside world, whose impressions arouse such stimulation. When a person sees a bright light, then even after the light goes out he still senses the light for a brief moment, because the stimulation of the sense of sight still remains. It is also like this with all of the senses, where the sound is a feeling in the eardrum, the taste is a feeling on the tongue, smell is a feeling in the nose – all feeling is based on impulses sent to the brain and to the soul. Even though the Gemara tells us that it is actually the soul that enjoys a good scent and not the body, still, no one would deny that someone whose sense of smell is damaged does not smell, so it follows that the sense of smell begins with a stimulation of nerves that send impulses to the brain. But the feeling activates the soul. It is not that the body doesn’t sense the smell, it is rather that the body does not derive enjoyment from this stimulation the way it does from eating, for example. It is only the soul that enjoys the smell. The world at large is known to man through the senses, and once this information is received, man can then act and speak in order to fulfill his wants and needs. If it were not for the five senses which are stimulated in man based on sights, sounds, tastes, scents, and feelings which are all based on external stimuli, he would not know that there were such things in the world and he would not be able to act in response to them.
It is not only the body and the brain that is stirred to sensation, but there is also a spark hidden in the soul which is known and revealed through external stimuli. Man’s soul and its arousal is not just hidden from other people, and only revealed to them when he responds to external stimulation - man’s soul is even hidden from himself. Man only knows that there is a portion of his soul that hears at a time when it is stimulated by a sound, and he experiences another revelation of another portion of his soul that feels when that portion is stimulated by touch. His soul is revealed at a time when it is stimulated.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">{Note provided by the author in original text}: There are other ways in which the soul is aroused, through the intellect, through music and poetry, which all serve to reveal different aspects of the soul. Yet since we are trying to explain the matter in brief, we will only speak about the senses that are the more basic motivators of the soul’s revelation, and that which pertains to such stimulation. May God allow us to study the matter in depth in another place.</i>
It is thus with the activation of the soul that is stimulated by the world, and also with the influence that the soul exerts upon the world, that when a man carries out an action, or arrives at certain understanding, that the strength or wisdom of his soul is revealed at the time of this action or thought.
However, man’s senses are only of this world, whether we refer to ways in which the senses are influenced from the world or that which man does to influence the world at large, and only for the purpose of physical objects in the world. [Even] the revelation of the soul is affected according to the measure and even the form of physical objects. The whole intention of actions is geared around physical things, such as feeling something and knowing that it is snow or fire, or hearing a voice and knowing whose voice it is, or seeing something and knowing that it is a table or something else. Therefore man’s whole orientation in using his senses is not for the sake of man’s inner sensation, but rather for the sake of the object in the world which was sensed by man, such as hearing the voice, seeing and feeling the snow or the table. The orientation is so external that even when man’s soul is stimulated he does not feel his inner soul activity, but rather feels the things of the world outside himself which brought about the sensation, such as the voice or the fire.
It could be that since man is accustomed from early childhood to use his senses in order to make contact with the world, to verify his place in the world and gain the desired results, that he becomes habituated from an early age to being suppressed before the world and he does not feeling what is really happening on the inside. That is to say, he does not feel the workings of his own senses within, but only feels that which happens from without, i.e.he just hears the voice and feels the table, even though his soul is now stimulated, and that stimulation of soul is the entire point of his knowledge. This is true both when the soul is stimulated and when it is stimulating as well. When a man does an action, such as moving a table, his aim is to move the table, and his will and mind are suppressed towards this end. Because of this, when he does and feels the action, he does not feel what happens within his soul at the time of the action. Even if the action requires such a great effort that afterwards he feels that his soul has effected something of such great magnitude that a part of his soul went out of him in the course of his action, still, at the time of the action itself he feels nothing of the workings of his soul, but only how he had previously gathered up or spent his soul’s forces, and no more.
Yet it is not like this when a man experiences deep inner feelings of desire, such as love or fear. In this case the arousal of desire is not contingent on some external need or action. The stirrings of love between a father and son, two brothers, or simply two people who feel love for each other is not in order for one to receive a gift from the other, or contingent on getting some sort of benefit from the other. When you love a person simply in order to get something in return then you really only love yourself; True, it is normal for one to give a gift or help a loved one as an expression of love; but true love is not contingent on personal gain, for people who love each other feel a constant excitement of love and longing for each other even when they don’t do anything external for each other. To the contrary, when a loved one travels and the two are separated by physical distance, their love and yearning burns even stronger. It is true also with feelings of fear, hatred, and anger, which are independent feelings that sometimes give way to a physical expression, and at other times do not. Regardless, the very action is an expression of man’s own soul. When you ask the man about his love or his anger, he will not say that it is in order to give the other one a gift or a beating. He will rather say, “I simply love him and miss him,” or, “I just hate him and cannot bare to look at him.” Even when the feeling is ostensibly connected to either doing or not doing some external action, still, the feelings are not limited by the possibilities of action, because he wants far more than that which is possible to do. A person could want to do many things based on his emotions, but has no real intention of doing them because he understands that it is impossible or not proper to do them. Therefore the desire is not only for the sake of the action that it expresses.
We are not suggesting that feelings are undressed (naked – unmediated no filter) actions of the soul, where the activity of the soul is completely independent of the body or any physical expression. Man cannot feel the soul’s pure undressed stimulations (raw – unmediated functions) . (We even need to explain just how much a pure feeling of the soul’s stimulation uncovered by the body or the physical world can actually be felt by man.) We only say that even though that which a man does is an expression of the workings of his soul, still, this soul activity is so concealed and dressed up in the external matters of the world to the point where it is not seen or felt by the man himself. When something sensed in the world surrounding the soul activity becomes distanced, such as a sight or a sound, then the very part of the soul that saw it or heard it is concealed from man’s own perception. At that point there is a need for the mind to represent the particular revelation of soul connected to that action with some external form that man can comprehend. This soul activity is comparable to a mirror, where the function of a mirror is to reflect an external image that is something other than the mirror itself. In the same way, man sees forms of the world embedded in portions of his soul, but does not sense the soul in itself. That which man now feels on the inside, such as a sound or the coldness of the snow, is something other than the thing itself or the feeling of his very soul activity.
Up until now we have been talking about physical sensations. Yet it is different with feelings, even though they also work through the body, the nervous system, and the brain. Like physical sensations, feelings are sensitized by external stimuli, i.e. something you want, someone you love or hate and the like. But in contrast to physical sensations, a person actually feels the inner sensation of his soul. For instance, if he hears a sound, and you ask him what he feels, he will say something like, “I hear a door slamming,” and no more. But if he is filled with love and you ask him to say exactly what he feels, he won’t say, “I feel my dear Reuven,” but he will say, “I feel love.” But if you ask him who he feels the love for, then he will say, “I feel love for Reuven.” The emotion he feels within him is the activity and sensation of his soul in love. It is only that that emotion seizes upon something external, like Reuven, or what you will, just as when fire seizes a log, the fire is merely seizing the wood but it is not seen in the form of wood. Rather the fire engenders a separate form unto itself. This is as it was mentioned in the Zohar, quoted above in chapter one, that the arousal, meaning even most basic feeling within man, is the arousal of the nefesh (soul), since when man feels stimulation within his being, he is feeling a stimulation of his soul, and as such, he is “revealing” it.
With this in mind, we can understand why the great and holy souls took such pains to refine their behavior,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Good behavior, “middos tovos,” in Hebrew, meaning being calm and composed rather than angry, industrious rather than lazy, joyful rather than melancholy, and so forth.</i> and were so adamant in their fight against even the slightest corruption of conduct. They based their view on the Talmud, which says that the punishment for bad behavior is more severe than the punishment for marrying forbidden relatives and the like.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The “bad behavior” discussed by the Gemara is that of cheating by using false measurements in a sales transaction (See Devarim, 25:16). However, the Hebrew term for conduct or behavior, “middot,” is the same as the word for measurement. In this way the author can justifiably take the term out of its context in the Gemara and apply it to all “middos ra’os (improper conduct),” anger, pride, and the like.</i> This is clear in light of what we have explained above, that the soul is revealed through the stimulation of his behavior. If a man accustoms himself from his childhood to get excited about vain and worldly pleasures, then the portion of his soul that is revealed in this excitement is thereby blemished. In his behavior, he forces his soul to be associated with foolishness to the point where his soul will naturally wake up to spurious stimulation. He will then find it quite natural to invest his soul in the lowest of pursuits. This is akin to the two angels that fell and were blemished in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This is explained in the Chovot Hatalmidim (A Student’s Obligation), chapter 10.</i>
To put it simply, we could say that with a physical action, man does not feel a part of his soul, and with emotions and behavior based on emotions, man feels his soul more. This is because the root of action is below<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Or external, meaning, the action is what is seen and felt, but the behavior is an inner function.</i> emotions. Therefore with action only a small portion of the soul is revealed through action to the extent where the soul is not even sensed. Yet when emotions, since the root of emotion is higher than action, and the stimulation of emotion reveals a greater portion of the soul, man can thereby feel his soul when emotions are aroused.
Here we may ask why a great physical action done with great effort does not cause man to feel his soul – in the final analysis a portion of his soul is in fact aroused – but man does feel his soul even with the smallest stirring of emotion? The supposition that the root of emotion is higher than the root of actions agrees with the Kabbalistic view that actions in the world happen in the plane of Asiyah (the physical world) and emotions are rooted in a higher spiritual plane.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">This passage requires basic knowledge of Kabbalah. The Rebbe is referring to the Kabbalistic teaching that the middos (emotions) find their spiritual roots in the very names of God, or in our case, in the expansion of the Tetragrammaton called Mah (45) יוד הא ואו הא. The Kabbalah teaches of four worlds. Each world has a name of God related to it. The name related to each world is simply a different spelling or “expansion” of the Tetragrammaton – the letter yud is spelled with the three letters yud vav dalet, the letter hei is spelled in different ways, such as hei hei, hei aleph, and so forth. The lowest world is called “assiyah,” represented by the name Ba”n (יוד הה וו הה), and is associated with physical actions. Above it is “yetsira” (the world of formation), represented by the name Ma”h (יוד הא ואו הא), and is associated with emotions or middos. Above yetsira is “beriya” (the world of creation), represented by the name Sa”g (יוד הי ואו הי), and is associated with the spiritual root of the senses of hearing and scent. Above Beriya is the highest world, called “atsilut” (the world of emanation), represented by the name A”b (יוד הי ויו הי), and is associated with the spiritual source of the sense of sight.</i> Yet this supposition is called into question when we lean from the Kabbalah that the root of the very senses, sight and sound, come from a higher plane than that of the emotions. The root of emotions is in the name Ma”h. The root of the sense of sight, however, is in the name A”b (higher than Ma”h), and the root of hearing and scent is in the name Sa”g (also higher than the root of emotions. See note 40 for a clarification of this idea.) This is all written in the Eyts Chaiim of the Ari”zal. The Kabbalah teaches us that though the spiritual roots of the senses of sight and sound are higher than the spiritual roots of emotion, still, the actual sensation of sight and sound take place in the lowest world of Assiyah, the plane of physical action, below the plane that is home to the source of emotion. Still, the portion of the soul that is revealed by the activity of the senses remains hidden, whereas the arousal of emotion reveals the soul more.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Because the source of emotion is lower in the heavenly order than the source of sensation, and thus closer to our perception in the physical world, we more readily feel emotion than the deep source of sensation.</i>
With this in mind, we see that it is nearly impossible to measure the greatness that man can achieve were he to sanctify his <i>middos</i> and serve God with constant <i>hisragshus</i> and <i>hislahavus</i>! His <i>avodah</i> reveals his soul. The fire does not seize onto something foreign like wood, but seizes onto fire itself! It is like a flame burning on coal, inseparable, but in this case his emotions (middos) are burning with <i>hisragshus</i> for nothing less that the love and fear of God, may He be blessed!
We may understand parenthetically the power of fervent <i>avodas Hashem</i> to subdue man’s physical needs. When a man burns with the love or reverence of God he can often go for long periods of time without eating or sleeping. He is living on the power of his soul, and his physical powers are nullified before it. The greater the <i>hislahavus</i> of <i>avodas Hashem</i> and the stimulation of the soul, the greater he will experience the nullification of his very senses. If he ascends like a burning fire, then his entire being will be nullified before his <i>Avodah</i>, for such is the nature of burning desire.
Now, my dear young scholar, my dear <i>Avreich</i>, we can finally give you way to identify precisely what you are feeling at a time when your are aroused to <i>avodas Hashem</i>. By means of this you may clearly know when you are feeling mere <i>hisragshus</i>, and when what you are experiencing is actual burning desire or <i>hislahavus</i>. Truly, we are not able to reach the level of the <i>hislahavus</i> of the great Tzaddikim, and all the more we cannot even ascertain when it starts, how far it reaches, and what place is sanctified by the fire of its flames. In beholding such great levels our faces are burned. In the end of the holy <i>sefer</i> Noam Elimelich of Rav Elimelech of Lyzhansk (1717-1787), he writes in the first epistle that, “the love of God brings man to the brink of madness.” When the Tsaddikim learn the Gemara they are verily consumed by fire out of their great love and <i>kedushah</i>. Concerning this he writes in the second epistle, “when the Tsaddikim study the Gemara they dress themselves in the garment of fear and trembling, awe and reverence for God, may He be blessed. Then the power of their Torah shines on their faces … the love of the Torah and its light burns within them continually … a love so great burns in their hearts that it shines in the light of their faces and casts dread upon all who see it. Sinners flee in terror from their presence, overcome by the tremendous power of their <i>kedushah</i> and <i>yiras Shamayim</i>.” Rav Kalonymus Kalman Epstein (d. 1823), who was a student of Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk, wrote in his <i>sefer</i> the <b>Maor VaShemesh</b> (Parshas Va’eschanan), “Holy <i>seforim</i> and the stories told about great Tsaddikim tell us that when a Jew learns Torah with <i>hislahavus</i> and great <i>deveikus</i>, he is surrounded by a wall of fire. Then all who witness this see as they did at the giving of the Torah, and all of the seven heavens open for Israel. And when a man of Israel learns Torah with <i>hislahavus</i>, his prayer makes an impression above … and brings about a flow of good abundance from heaven to all the denizens of the earth.”
For our purposes and at our level, we will now give you a way to ascertain whether that which you are experiencing is the higher state of true <i>hislahavus</i>, or whether what you are feeling is the lower state of mere <i>hisragshus</i>. When you feel the love and fear of God, but these feelings do not cancel out your worldly desires and aspirations, then what you are experiencing is mere <i>hisragshus</i>. However, it is a totally different experience when your feelings burn at such a level that you actually feel repulsion for the physical world and physical aspirations, and your one desire is God’s <i>kedushah</i> and God’s Torah. In a state of <i>hislahavus</i>, you may not feel the repulsion, but at least you will not feel drawn to physical desires whatsoever. Your feelings will nonetheless overcome you, and you will not be able to hold back your <i>hislahavus</i> or desist in your burning love and fear of <i>Hashem</i>. For example, if you pray at a time when you eschew worldly desires, even if you do not experience <i>hislahavus</i> during the entire prayer from beginning to end, but still, for a moment in your prayer you burn with <i>hislahavus</i> and you simply cannot pray in an unexcited, mundane way, then what you are experiencing is the beginning of <i>hislahavus</i> and not mere <i>hisragshus</i>. Don’t you find on Rosh Hashanah when the congregation is listening to the blowing of the Shofar, and on Yom Kippurim, especially during Kol Nidre and Neilah, that all of your physical desires, aspirations, and yearnings are nullified at this moment, because your constant <i>hisragshus</i> brought you to pass the threshold into <i>hislahavus</i>, and you just cannot hold back because your entire soul and being burns with the flames of God?
And with this we have arrived at our central point, namely that when an action is done without <i>hisragshus</i> whatsoever, then it is difficult for such a great light from heaven to descend and rest upon it. In order for God’s light to rest upon a person it needs the <i>Merkava</i> (chariot) of a revealed soul.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Just as God was revealed to Yechezkel in the Charriot, similarly, when a person has revealed his soul it is a form of “chariot” that enables God’s light to rest there.</i> Yet when a person serves God with <i>hislahavus</i>, then, seeing as his soul is revealed at that time, and his senses are nullified, then he is worthy of an even greater revelation of the supernal light. Therefore, though you cannot say that serving God with <i>hislahavus</i> is the be all and the end all of Chassidus, nevertheless, it is an essential concept that Chassidus cannot do without. This is because the path of Chassidus is the modern equivalent of the path of the prophets, as mentioned above, and God’s supernal light can only rest on a revealed soul.
How can we begin? We would not be so arrogant as to presume that we have reached the level of the great Rebbes, the masters of Chassidus! Because of our modest circumstances, it is difficult to even begin to reach a state of <i>hislahavus</i>, let alone to return to it again and again. Our first goal must then be a state of excitement in <i>Avodas Hashem</i>, because such excitement is the first step in attaining a state of <i>hislahavus</i>, as it is the preliminary stage which stirs the <i>nefesh</i>, as mentioned above in the Zohar. With excitement, we are able God willing to reach <i>hislahavus</i>. Yet it is precisely when a man serves God with his physical power that he is able to cultivate and establish the qualities of holy excitement and <i>hislahavus</i>, and if he does not, then both his excitement and <i>hislahavus</i> will wane. This is because excitement and <i>hislahavus</i> are not just responses to external stimuli, which serve to reveal a specific portion of his soul. So how could it be that the heart of his soul is revealed in a state of <i>hislahavus</i> and he is able to sustain this level at a time when his body and the powers of his soul are not actually serving God?
And furthermore, when a person comes to rouse himself he will find it much easier if he puts all his energy into one form of <i>Avodas Hashem</i>. If it is difficult for him to become excited and if he does not resort to some sort of artifice then the <i>hisragshus</i> will not come on its own. But if he throws himself into some form of <i>avodas Hashem</i> with all his physical power he could succeed in bringing about the <i>hisragshus</i> even at a time when he does not want to serve. An so it is with all of our efforts in <i>Avodas Hashem</i>, whether it is willing, or whether it is at a time when the <i>yester ha’ra</i> burdens us with laziness or foolishness, that we force ourselves to learn Torah, to pray, and fulfill mitzvos. And according to all that has been said, this too is called, “doing with strength.” Such action is able to stimulate the soul and reveal it slightly. However, when this kind of, “doing with strength” is done on its own and unaccompanied by any holy <i>hisragshus</i>, then it is embedded in the physical and hidden in the action to the point where he does not know or feel the revelation of the soul that accompanies it. How much more so will a man not feel any revelation of his soul if he tries to serve God at a time when his heart is sunk in folly and his brain is filled with the vanities of the world. And yet, when he clears his mind of any impurity, and it is clear in his mind that he is standing before the Holy One, blessed be He, and he performs his <i>avodah</i> before God with meekness and a broken spirit, then even if he does not resort to any actions to wake up his <i>hisragshus</i> he will seize his soul by the back of its neck and pull it out of hiding. In such a case it will be hard for him not to feel some <i>hisragshus</i> in the awakening of his love, fear, and desire for God.
We discussed this matter in the book, <b>A Student’s Obligation</b>, Chapter 2 Section 2, concerning the <i>hakafos</i> on <i>Shmini Atseres</i> and <i>Simchas Torah</i>, where by means of putting all his strength into dancing a man can pull himself out of the dust and feel the revelation of his soul. The same can be achieved by praying out loud with strength. If one dances uninspired <i>hakafos</i>, relying only on intellectual appreciation, or if one just says the words of his prayer, he has done nothing to wake up his soul. Yet by dancing with gusto or praying out loud with all his heart and all his strength, he will then be excited by his <i>avodah</i> – and indeed our holy <i>sefarim</i> teach us that raising the voice increases the intention – since he serves with strength, and in this way he will reveal his soul even against his will.

Chapter 3

<big><strong>Hisragshus and The Ability to Feel Hisragshus</strong></big>
It has been established that the soul is not only revealed by reaching the state of <i>hislahavus</i>, but can be started even through mere <i>hisragshus</i>, and by means of animated <i>avodas Hashem</i> the heavenly light will appear upon man. The feelings of delight that accompany a man’s holy <i>hisragshus</i> during prayer, <i>avodah</i>, or Torah study are the flashes of the sparks of delight and flames of holiness from his own portion in Gan Eden. He will feel this delight after spending many days and years in his eternal world of song, prayer, and Torah study, all done with yearning for Hashem, may He be blessed. Then God will enter Gan Eden, taking delight in the Tsaddikim and in him. The Chassidic Masters found this concept hinted at in the Gemara (Berachos 17) which says, “<i>olameicha tiray be’chayeicha</i> - You will see your world in you lifetime.” The Gemara hints that you can already see your future world (your world to come, or your portion on Gan Eden) in your lifetime here on earth. That is to say, the excitement and the delight that you feel in your holy <i>avodas Hashem</i> here on earth is an illumination sent from the upper world.
The Zohar Chadash in Parshas Behar has the following to say on this subject. “Rabbi Shimon said … sustenance from the world to come is found here on earth in a greatly constricted form, and the power of this sustenance is found in the sweetness of the Torah.” The <b>Beis Aharon</b> (Parshas Shlach, under, “<i>ohr zaruah la’tsaddik</i>”) teaches us, “even though this world and the world to come are two complete polar opposites, they are nonetheless connected to one another. This is evinced by the saying, “he who has this world also has the world to come.” The meaning of this saying is not referring to enjoyment of the pleasures of the world, fine food and drink and so forth, but rather one who has the world to come in this world is one who tastes of the world to come in the <i>mitzvos</i> that he performs in this world. He may find the world to come by connecting with the hidden light contained within the mitzvah. However, a person cannot have a taste of the world to come if he does not taste such light in this world through the hidden light of the mitzvos.”
Often a person wants to pray and serve God, but his prayer and his <i>avodah</i> does not ascend in burning flames of <i>kedushah</i>. Though he wants to wake up to the excitement of <i>avodah</i>, not wanting to offer an unfeeling, cold, dry prayer, but rather a prayer filled with vitality, still, he is unable. At such a time, he is advised against being stubborn in his resolve to feel the <i>hisragshus</i>. It is an oddity of human nature that when a person demands something from himself, for instance, to push away a disturbing thought, or even to keep a good thought in mind, that he actually brings about the opposite of what he wants. The disturbing thought will chase him, and the good thought that he wants to seize upon will run away from him, or at best will only stay with him for a short while. In particular, when he insists upon waking up to <i>hisragshus</i> or <i>hislahavus</i> at times of prayer or <i>avodah</i>, more often than not he will find his heart closed. He will find it ironic, saying, “Before I started to pray I felt a spark of awakening, and I thought there was a holy flame was burning inside of me. And now that I brought myself to actually pray it feels that any spark that was there before is extinguished. There is no fire or flame, and it is if there is no heart, God forbid!” But you, my young man, who yearns so strongly for God, do not be afraid. And you, <i>Avriech</i>, who desires the kedushah of God, do not be perplexed. So it will be according to human nature if you do not resort to tricks or innovative techniques.
Simple <i>Avodah</i> that man employs at times when he is serving God must be done with simple intention. He shall think, “I am a servant of God, and the <i>davening</i>, Torah, and mitzvos that I use to serve God are my Godly portion. I do not only cleave to God through an intellectual understanding of the Torah, since this is the knowledge of God and His very will [as we have explained at length in A <b>Student’s Obligation</b>, Chapters 9 and 12], but I also cleave to God through the physical performance of mitzvos. Even the words and letters of the Torah and the <i>tefillah</i>, the names of God, the <i>Sefiros</i>, and the holy angels all come from supernal <i>kedushah</i>. And when I pronounce them, God and His holy myriads of angels come and pass through me, and it is incumbent upon me to connect and cleave to this supernal <i>kedushah</i> which has become tangible and drawn to me.” A person is able to draw his very vitality from this intention when he believes in it with simple faith and steadfast resolve. Again we learn from the <b>Beis Aharon</b> (Shabbos Shuvah), “whatever the Israelite does, he must feel lasting vitality and meaning in the action. Even if his action is only like an ox under the yoke or the donkey carrying its load, the very fact that he has the great privilege of doing God’s will like an ox under the yoke or a donkey carrying its load should be a sweet pleasure in his estimation. And when he takes pleasure in this, then he will, with God’s help, feel the meaning in his actions.”
In this you may understand that there is no contradiction between what we have said and ideas found in other holy <i>sefarim</i>. In some <i>sefarim</i> we learn that all <i>avodah</i>, Torah, prayer, and mitzvos are to be performed only with vitality, <i>hisragshus</i>, and <i>hislahavus</i>, and that is a man’s portion in Gan Eden. This may seem to contradict the statements found in other holy sefarim that man should not serve God in order to achieve <i>hislahavus</i>, but should rather cultivate a simple service. These sefarim<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The author does not mention these sefarim by name.</i> tell us, “Do not ask for <i>hislahavus</i> in prayer. One should rather enter himself into the words of the prayer and the <i>avodah</i>, and the <i>hislahavus</i> will come by itself.” Truly <i>hislahavus</i> is the central principle, but during prayer you should not ask for it or stubbornly insist upon it. Just serve God with simplicity and it will come by itself. We have not reached or understood the lofty intentions of these holy <i>sefarim</i>, but for our purposes it will suffice to heed the advice that one should not ask for <i>hislahavus</i> during prayer, because a person does not always receive what he demands of himself, and could even receive the opposite. Just serve with simplicity, and the <i>hislahavus</i> will come by itself.
And now, the young scholar or Avreich may ask, “whatever I do the <i>hislahavus</i> will not come by itself! At first I thought to stubbornly insist upon it, and as if to anger me it was closed up. And now that I do not insist upon it, it is also hidden from me. Perhaps, God forbid, there is no way to fix my situation? Has God distanced himself from me so I cannot hear his words, and my <i>avoda</i> will be done with a closed mind and a closed heart?”
For the time being we will provide you with a brief answer. Shlomo HaMelech made it known in his <i>ruach hakodesh</i><sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Divine inspiration.</i> (Mishlei 4:7), “The acquiring of wisdom is the beginning of wisdom.” The Torah is like a hammer that smashes down on hot iron<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The author actually said, “like a hammer that shatters rock,” but begging his forgiveness in Gan Eden, I changed it to hot iron to enhance the imagery.</i> and sends sparks flying to all places in man, even in the finest cracks and crevices, bringing light to the darkest of places. From the plain meaning of this verse we learn that it is impossible for a man to use wisdom if he has not acquired wisdom, made it his own and is indeed wise to begin with. With this in mind, we similarly find that if you manage to enter a measure of wisdom into a boor, seeing as the wisdom is not his and he has no wisdom to begin with, then therefore even thought you have managed to give him this one piece of wisdom, still he cannot use it, analyze it, or understand any other wisdom by himself. Only if he were to truly become wise, then he could use this wisdom, and discern that which he wants to know at every moment and in every matter.
It is similar with man’s feelings. It is only possible for a man to become excited over something if he is a man of feeling and enthusiasm. The same is true with a person’s physical circumstances. Not everyone feels his situation in the same way. Some people are very excitable. Such an individual might feel tremendous anxiety at even the slightest problem, and great joy at anything good or even the promise of the slightest good. His reactions will be intense. When he worries he becomes thoroughly bitter and melancholy. When he is happy he almost goes out of his mind with joy. He will become easily angered, and easily compassionate towards others. You cannot say that this person is basically angry, or mainly depressed, or joyous or compassionate, since he feels tremendous emotion over anything and its opposite. This individual can only be accurately termed, “and excitable person,” as he gets excited easily over everything. Then there is the opposite type of person. He is as cool, unfeeling and unemotional as a rock. He rarely gets excited, and when he does, it is with great restraint.
Since even the animal soul of the Israelite is a Merkava for the Godly soul, and also, the spiritual essence of the animal soul is rooted in the Ox in the Merkava (in the vision of Yechezkel), thus we find that when the Israelite serves God with all his strength and effort then the animal soul is also transformed into <i>kedushah</i>. In this way we see that a man’s holy <i>avodah</i> is also dependent on the animal soul and the nature of man. The <b>Imrei Elimelich</b> of my saintly father, Rav Elimelech of Grodzisk (Parshas Toldos) tells us that even concerning man’s evil inclination, that the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> of a hot-tempered person can be entered into <i>kedushah</i>, but it is harder to enter the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> of a cold and unfeeling person into <i>kedushah</i>. We have already brought the words of Rav Elimelech’s famous prayer in the beginning of <b>A Student’s Obligation</b>, in the section entitled, “Conversation with The Teachers and the Fathers,” which says, “Someone who is hot-tempered can easily bring himself to <i>hislahavus</i> with burning flames of desire.” This is all to say that it is difficult to accustom someone to a way of behavior concerning <i>avodas Hashem</i> if his nature is not suited to it. For this reason, a hot-tempered person can cultivate <i>hislahavus</i> much more easily that a cold type.
When Rav Elimelech spoke of the “burning flames of desire,” he was speaking about the particulars of desire and of its loftiness. Therefore he speaks of the hot-tempered nature as being qualified for such ascents. Hot-temperedness, from which anger is drawn, could ascend to the highest levels of desire like flames of fire to God. With us it is not so, for as we have said our purpose for the time being is to stimulate the agitation of the <i>nefesh</i> and to ruffle its feathers, meaning the very first stirrings and <i>hisragshus</i> of the soul. Not only are the particular level of <i>hislahavus</i> and the lofty, “burning flames,” dependent on this first stimulation of the soul, but rather everything, all desire and all behavior, is dependant upon it. It is not enough to know intellectually that one needs to desire, to fear, or to love. One should rather be excited in his desire, fear, and love. Therefore, we will not only discuss the particular case of the hot-tempered spirit, but rather about intensity of feeling in general, which includes the excitable hot-tempered spirit, the deep-feeling compassionate spirit, and men of sensitivity who are easily moved to tears or to joy. These temperaments are better prepared for such an awakening. And now, with the help of the One who rouses the sleeping, we seek to know how one can become a, “man of <i>hisragshus</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">(The author provides the following long footnote.) If you are clever, we many ask you, “If excitement reveals a part of the soul, and the man of excitement is worthy of this, then would it be true that a nervous type, who gets worked up over everything, and feels great excitement at such times, reveals a greater portion of his soul and would thus be considered a superior man?” We may further ask you, “how is that excitement serves only to reveal the soul? Doesn’t excitement activate the nerves even more, as we see an excited person’s heart beating faster and breathing heavier? If so, then excitement is only a physical sensation!” <br>Do not be taken aback by this question, nor get too involved in its analysis, but rather give the following simple answer. If excitement is only a physical sensation, then why is it that when the soul leaves the body, the nerves cease to work, as well as the heart and the lungs? Aren’t we discussing the vital soul, and for this reason we opened with the words of the Zohar, which tells us that the nefesh is adjacent to the body, sustaining and uniting with the body. All actions of the soul that are revealed to us are revealed through the workings of the body. Therefore with excitement, though it reveals the nefesh, still, its activation comes through the body and the nerves. Yet because the rest of the activity of the soul is covered up by the actions of the body and are not revealed to man, the activation of excitement is felt by itself, as it comes from the soul. <br>Since the nefesh is adjacent to the body, they influence one another. A physical sensation, whether painful or pleasurable, arouses the excitement of the nefesh. It is also true with thought. If one thinks of something he loves or hates, even if he never had any physical contact with the object of his thought to his benefit or detriment, but it is only his soul which is excited, still, the body will become excited, his heart beating faster and his breathing heavier. <br>And now if you also ask how it is that the prophets would sometimes employ simple actions to become joyful, such as Elisha the prophet playing music, or the meeting of Shaul and the band of prophets after returning from Shmuel where it is written, “and the drum, the flute, and the harp were before them, and they prophesized.” (Shmuel 1, 10:5) Don’t we often find people getting together in the same way and entering into debauchery and sin? The prophet had to begin by revealing his soul, as we said at the outset, and such revelation requires <i>simchah</i> in order for the <i>Shechinah</i> to rest upon him, for the <i>Shechinah</i> only rests upon a place of <i>simchah</i>. You cannot say that everyone who is joyous and reveals a part of his soul becomes worthy of prophecy, just as not everyone who is wise, mighty, and rich will experience prophecy, even though these were some of the conditions required for prophecy. Everyone who is joyous reveals a portion of his soul, but if he is a servant of God, then his service will be on a higher level, since he is serving God with a revealed soul. But if he is not, then he will miss the opportunity, and furthermore, he will sin with a revealed soul. This is the serious problem of blemished behavior mentioned in the previous chapter. So it is with the servant of God, if he serves in such a way that arouses excitement he will find it easy to reveal his soul and his service will be on a higher level. But not everyone who gets excited is serving God, just as not everyone who is joyous is a prophet. The Jewish people are prone to anxiety, but this is actually a result of being descendant of prophets. If they take this anxiety and use it for <i>Avodas Hashem</i>, then they will achieve a higher <i>avodah</i>, even reaching <i>ruach hakodesh</i>. And if they do not use their abilities for <i>Avodas Hashem</i>, then it is like someone born with great intellectual brilliance who risks madness if he doesn’t use his mind for wisdom. It is the same with excitement, which prepares man to engender holy self-nullification, <i>hislahavus</i>, and <i>ruach hakodesh</i>, but if not channeled into holy service, could lead to bad behavior and anxiety. With this in mind, we can better understand why when they came to ridicule the prophet (see Melachim 2, 9:11), that they called him this particular name.</i>




And now, even if someone makes the mistake in claiming that <i>hislahavus</i> in <i>avodah</i> is only a sublime spiritual ascent and only <i>b’nei aliyah</i>, high souls experienced in such ascents need to strive for it, but not the common man, then even if your evil inclination leads you to assert that you could be an <i>avreich</i> and Chassid without <i>hislahavus</i> [though it is inconceivable that anyone could be a Chassid save through the power of <i>hislahavus</i>, the beginning of Chassidus and the way of the prophets], still be aware that it is widely understood that one cannot be called a Chassid without <i>hislahavus</i>, which is the beginning of the awakening of the soul that we seek to arouse within you. Even the simple service of God cannot be only intellectual, by just understanding that this is good and that is bad, this is to be done and that is to be refrained from. Someone whose service is only in his mind, who knows that he needs to fear and love God, love His Torah, its commandments, his children, the people of Israel, yet feels no <i>hisragshus</i> in all of this, is not so different from one who only advises others, but is personally drawn to all manner of ugliness and evil. This is because such a person in his essence does not only feel no <i>hisragshus</i> for good and <i>kedushah</i>, but is actually enthusiastically drawn to ugliness and animal desires. Could a father of sound mind spend every minute of the night and day watching over his deranged son, Heaven forfend, who is constantly drawn to destruction and ruin, where if the father stops guarding his son for a second the son will carry out his plans and reduce the house to rubble? It is impossible for a man to guard himself purely through knowledge, for if he does not enter himself and his <i>hisragshus</i> into <i>kedushah</i>, then these qualities will remain in physicality just as they are for a dog or a mouse. When a man sleeps and he is not in control of his mind, God forbid that he doesn’t need to be a Jew, for then God protects us! So too, when he is awake, it is impossible for him to watch over his deranged son constantly without diverting his attention.
And even worse than this, even at a time when he is guarding himself, his mind is not controlling his (self and his) emotions, but rather his emotions are controlling his (self and his) mind. His emotions distort his reasoning, causing him to mix up good and evil. The verse (Mishlei, 21:2) says, “every man’s path is right in his own eyes.” Why is it that the path of the thief, which is immoral, is correct in his own estimation? Why is it that the thief cannot understand something that is so clear to the rest of the world? It must be that his whole being and evil desires are distorting his mind.
My hair stood on end after hearing the complaints of elder Hassidim who claimed that that now they cannot resist their desires the way they could when they were younger. This problem stems from the same reason. In their youth their divine service was only in their minds, never paying attention to the improvement of their selves and their emotions by directing them to good and <i>kedushah</i>. They merely stopped themselves, and held back when were excited by evil. Therefore, when they became advanced in age and weakened, so did their power of struggle and restraint weaken. They found respite in the taming of their desires that comes with age, but still suffer from those desires whose powers did not wane, almost totally unable to stand against them. We find that neither all desires nor all men are tamed with the weakening of the body that comes with age. There is a man whose nerves are prone to a particular desire or yearning, whether it’s eating sweets or drinking or speaking <i>lashon ha’rah</i> or the “terrible and evil” desire,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">He is probably referring to promiscuity.</i> Heaven forfend. Such desires continue to provoke man even when the body weakens with the advancement of age. When his nerves weaken the desire provokes him more easily, as his defenses against these desires are weaker. Then it is evil and bitter for him, Heaven forfend.
Even though it is a very small percent of Chassidim that fall into this pit, still, no one is immune to the danger of being one who falls in this way when he reaches his elder years. One who hears this will cry and tremble. Our entire purpose is to subdue the cooing of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> at with ever-increasing strength at every moment of every day of every year, and to march step by step until we reach our ends and ascend from this world to the purity of God’s <i>kedushah</i> and the sweetness of the flame of His holiness, joining like a candle in a flame of a torch. And if, when we reach our senior years, it is still possible to add refuse to the rubbish that we have amassed in our years of wrongdoing, then we die away, we are lost, lost for ever in hell, God forbid, falling into the bottomless pit, never to return, may God be merciful and protect us!
I would say that it is impossible to serve God without sanctifying our whole beings, emotions, or being a man who is excited by <i>kedushah</i>. <i>Hisragshus</i> is the entire obligation of man! Draw it to the east and be dragged after it! To the west, to the north, to the south and it is after it! To the abyss and it is after it! Go up to the sky and it is also after it!
But for a man to reach this level of <i>hisragshus</i>, his heart and his attributes must soften sufficiently as to feel the good and the bad, life and death, and to be moved by his feelings, thus waking up to goodness and life, and being shocked by evil and death. This must be so even if he has not yet rectified himself, and he much work left to do in order to reach the goal of this rectification. But still, he is not like the deranged son, but rather like the wise son who already knows the good and is thrilled by it. He does not just know in his intellect that he needs to fear God, but his heart is actually riveted by the endless magnitude of the Infinite and Measureless One. He feels true <i>hisragshus</i> before the One who is higher than all of the worlds, and the very angels rush away from before Him!
A young scholar in this situation could be sitting alone at home and be seized by an evil thought or desire. Then suddenly, he shudders from head to toe, his hair stands on end, and says, “Isn’t God before me? Doesn’t He see me?” Then the young scholar’s heart begins to yearn to come close to God, and he is greatly embittered by the less than perfect thoughts that had just seized him. Then, in all his worry and bitterness, words seemingly come out of him on their own, saying, “Gevaldt! I have reached such a low place, such a place of humiliation! Who knows if I will, God forbid, stay this way forever. At this time, and all times in the future, Master of the World, have mercy upon me, remove me from this state of filth and purify me. Bring me close to Your service in <i>kedushah</i>.!” This kind of introspection on the part of the <i>avreich</i> is similar to a sick person who is aware of his illness. Such self-knowledge where one recognizes his own problems is the gateway to his own self and soul.
Indeed, only when he can activate himself at will is he comparable to the wise son who also has the wisdom within him. When a man’s <i>hisragshus</i> is only occasional, then his <i>hisragshus</i> is not in his control. When it comes to him he is aroused, and when it doesn’t he is not. Then he is like a piece of wood, cold and heavy. Though he is far better off than the deranged son, still, he has not reached the level of the wise son. He is rather like the son who at times is conscious of his illness, and at other times totally blind to his own situation. When he is conscious of his illness he knows how to distinguish between good and evil and desires that which is good. However, his knowledge is not as clear as the son who is ever healthy and wise. Also, his will is not as strong. At the times when he is blind to his own situation there is no difference between him and the deranged son. If only it were possible for this son to fix times for himself, where at a time that he chooses he could calm his mind, then his illness would not be so severe. What irks him is that he is not in control, and when the dreadful hour comes the spirit seizes him and he cannot seize the spirit, and who could be sure of the outcome of his actions at such a time?
And so with the man who cannot determine when to become excited, though he is better off than someone who is completely cold and dry, after all, at least he feels <i>hisragshus</i> from time to time, still, by and large it is not enough that the quality of his <i>hisragshus</i> is lower, yet it is also covered up, only feeling the <i>hisragshus</i> in his mind and heart. He cannot bring himself to feel the <i>hisragshus</i> in his bones, in his flesh, in his behavior. Furthermore, of what use is it to get excited about <i>avodas Hashem</i> once a year on Yom Kippur, or ever two or three times a year? It takes more than that to refine and sanctify his being for all the days, hours, and minutes of the year.
We do not presume to claim that we have any panacea that gives every man the reigns by which he will not get excited by anything improper and whenever he wants he can be excited by <i>kedushah,</i> with his thoughts wholly purified and burning up in a flame of fear and love. It is told that once when the holy Rabbi Yisrael, the Baal Shem Tov, was visiting the town of a certain great and famous man, that Rabbi Yisrael’s students asked him how they could know if this man was genuinely great, as they wanted to examine his character. Rabbi Yisrael told them to go and ask the man for advice on how a person could clean his character from all evil thoughts, tendencies, and confusions. If the man responds by giving some sort of specific advice, they should know that this man is a fraud. This is because there is no advice that anyone could give to completely do away with such problems, but rather it takes constant work all the days of a man’s life, each according to his own situation. Such constant work is more precious than everything in the whole world, and it is the <i>tachlis</i> (ultimate purpose) of man’s existence. God created man in order to do this constant work, and it is greater than the service of the angels in heaven, for they have no evil inclination or service like this.
We learn in the <b>Tanya</b>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">By Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi, (1745-1813) The Tanya was first published anonymously in 1796. The complete version was first printed in 1814.</i> (first section, chapter 27) that only perfect <i>Tsaddikim</i> are on the level of never having any evil thoughts whatsoever. It is not so with <i>Beynonim</i> (meaning intermediates, neither completely righteous or completely evil). It is the work of the <i>Beynoni</i> to fight against every evil thought that comes his way. Every time he pushes away an evil thought from his mind he manages to subdue the spiritual root of evil (the <i>Sitra Achra</i>). We have the principle that an awakening from below arouses an awakening from above, so our efforts in the world against evil manages to subdue the supernal <i>Sitra Achra</i>. This is the idea that is presented in the <b>Tanya</b>. Our aim is to make your <i>avodas Hashem</i> easier. We want to sensitize you, with God’s help. This could help you greatly, for the soul which burns within you will penetrate into your behavior and the limbs of your body, and then they too will burn with flames of holiness. Because of this, the quality of evil musings will diminish and their strength will wane. These thoughts will not plague you as aggressively as they used to, and they will even happen less frequently. It all depends upon you, my dear <i>Avreich</i>. The more you strive to reveal your soul in holy <i>avodah</i>, the quality and quantity of undesired thoughts will diminish. And furthermore, at a time when such a thought has the impunity to tread on the threshold of your heart and mind, it will not stay there long enough to contaminate your veins and sinews, but rather the moment its infected foot steps there, you will not even have to think but instinctively seize the thought by its despicable neck and, with fury and din, send it flying a arrow-shot’s length from you, breaking its joints. And as a result of your avodah, your pure thoughts will increase in quantity and strengthen in quality. They will not just happen from time to time, and not just like a shadow of a daydream, but rather surge through your mind with strength and brilliance, joined together with powerful resolve that may reach the level of great and eternal love.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The author is alluding to the two expressions of love for God that are used in the blessing just preceding the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, <i>ahavas olam</i> (eternal love), and <i>ahava rabbah</i> (great love).</i>

Chapter 4

<big><strong>Working Towards Hisragshus.</strong></big>
A person who desires to enter his entire being into <i>avodas Hashem</i>, and in particular, a person who yearns to prepare himself to serve God in the path of Chassidus, needs to strive for excitement in his <i>avodah</i>, in his fear and love of God, in his mitzvos, and in his prayer. Towards this purpose, he needs to develop himself into a complete, “man of <i>hisragshus</i>.” This is a brief summary of what has been said thus far. Truly, there are two main characteristics found in every Jew, one is found in a greater measure and the other in a lesser measure. One of the chief characteristics of Israel is that they are compassionate. And how could a dry, cold, and unfeeling personality be compassionate in nature? Even the cruel can at times express kindness, but it is impossible for a cruel person to be of a compassionate nature. What impulsivity is found in the people of Israel, who jump with flames of love between man and his fellow, and between close relations! This is evidence that getting excited is a part of the very foundation of their nature.<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">See the long footnote in the preceding chapter.</i> Holy sefarim teach us that even the love of God is a natural characteristic of the Jew, but that it is more hidden and not felt on its own.
This is the entire matter. When that which transpires within man is hidden and not felt, it serves create a chasm between man and himself. He does not know himself and is not aware of what is going on inside of him. The soul of the ordinary man does not cease to shake, quiver, and cry out over its lowly status, its wounds, and its pains that it suffers due to man’s foolish actions and thoughts. And man does not feel the pain of his own soul because he does not stop to listen to its painful cries that resound within him, because it is the way of man to constantly be drawn to that which is external to him, perceiving things form the outside world, whether necessary or useless. Though man will easily take interest at something that takes place on the other side of the world, he barely pays attention to the uproar within his own soul. It could be that he even feels the pain of his soul, it is just that at the time that he feels it his desires and thoughts are sunk in the rubbish of worldly matters, and therefore the sobbing of his soul is mixed together with the sounds of worldly vanity.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">See Shemos 32:18, “it is the voice of those that sing that I hear.”</i> This may be compared to a man who is sleeping, and a mosquito comes and bites him on the forehead. If he is a merchant, he will dream that a bundle of merchandise fell on his forehead and wounded him. If he is a tailor, he will dream that his needle pierced his forehead. Everyone sees his dream in the garment of his own thoughts.
We find in holy <i>sefarim</i> that it sometimes happens with the soul of a Jew, that when he becomes excited in the midst of regret, <i>teshuvah</i>, submission, fear of God, and the like, he may feel an uncomfortable stirring within him, and he does not know what to attribute this feeling. He may think he is hungry, thirsty, or perhaps needs a shot of vodka. He may think that depression has taken hold of him, so in order to entertain himself he banters playfully or childishly with other people in his house. Or perhaps he goes to his friends and entertains himself with <i>lashon ha’rah</i>, tale-bearing, or frivolity. And sometimes, if he still feels the discomfort within him even after all of this activity, it is because all of his remedies were actually damaging. It is not enough that he didn’t heal the wounds of his soul or even console it in its pain, but he actually afflicted and wounded his soul even more. It could also be that after all of these deceptive actions he actually feels better, and his soul is calmed within him. This is because either his soul fainted from all of the beatings and wounds that his actions inflicted upon it, or it was so harmed that it because completely covered up with the rubbish of his actions that the man cannot hear the cries of his soul and he is not disturbed.
A person does not only neglect to hear the cries and groans of his soul, so stifled that he is unable to recognize them for what they are, but he even neglects to feel the delight and joy that the soul takes in God. Sometimes he just feels something and cannot identify it. If a man only felt the joy that the soul takes in God, and the pleasantness that it feels when it ascends to the Eternal with love and fear, through Torah, prayer, and mitzvos, and in particular on the delight that the soul feels on Shabbos and Yom Tov, then the prevalence of the supernal delight would make it quite difficult for the evil inclination to rise up and seduce him. If man could only hear the song his nefesh sings to God at a time when he recites songs and praises while <i>davening</i>, the song of his <i>ruach</i>, <i>neshama</i>, <i>chayah</i> and <i>yechida</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">These are the five levels of soul.</i><i></i> who stand at the song of the nefesh and sing in one voice to the Glorious King who has chosen song and praises. They are all united in one flame of love and joy together with all the souls of Israel both on earth and in Gan Eden, and because of them the supernal angels sing to the Almighty together with all of the creations in heaven and on earth and below the earth. They all sing as one, lauding and sanctifying the name of the Holy One, the Great, the Powerful, and the Awesome One! If only man could hear the faintest whisper of such heavenly devotion. In hearing it he would readily dedicate his entire being together with all of his desires, thoughts, words, and actions to God and to nothing else. But it is all closed from him and hidden from his view.
And now, my dear young scholar, my dear <i>Avreich</i>, who desires to serve God and ascend in the ways of Chassidus, be happy with what we have told you, namely that you need not ask for any new <i>hisragshus</i>, nor do you require <i>hisragshus</i> to be sent to you from heaven. First and foremost, you have only to continue with your <i>avodas Hashem</i>, for it is all within you. The <i>hisragshus</i> is within you, and you are a man with the capacity to become excited in serving God. You just need to strive to know yourself, and all that goes on inside yourself. Your soul is filled with <i>hisragshus</i>, shouts and supplications, you just have to make a kind of vessel<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The actual word that the author used was, “bed (matsa’)” but the meaning is clearly some kind of vessel to contain the feeling. You could call it a spiritual or emotional compartment. The Rebbe Zts”l continues with the word, “bed.”</i> within yourself which you can access, and thereby strengthen yourself. Then you will know and feel your inner capacity for <i>hisragshus</i>, without the outer trappings of your self and your needs. Your feelings will discard the sack which hides it from its pure aspirations.
Our aim is not just to impose commands and directives, saying, “think this,” “say this,” and, “do that,” “don’t think this,” “don’t say this,” and, “don’t do that!” Everyone wants to think, say, and do things that are good, or at least, he wants to want, but it is difficult for him to bring his good intention to fruition. Our intention is only to find a way, with God’s help, to be able to fulfill that which the Torah, the holy sages, and masters of Chassidus have commanded us. Therefore we are obliged to discuss the means by which one can recognize the feelings of his soul. Therefore listen, and hear, and with God’s help you will be rewarded.
If you start with small stimulations that you feel within in order to bring them out and recognize them the way they are revealed in your soul, and not dressed in physical garments, and they are so small that you cannot recognize them at all, then in feeling them you will not be able to distinguish between the shout of victory and a whimper, or between <i>hisragshus</i> from the sound of the soul crying out to God, or from the physical desire for food and wine. It will be hard for you to manage such feelings, since you are not familiar with them, and then when you actually feel something transpiring within you, the feeling that you are experiencing has already dressed itself in sackcloth. Therefore, begin with greater and more powerful feelings where you recognize that the feeling of the nefesh is that of yearning and crying out to God. Yet since the vessel for the soul’s yearning is limited, the feeling does not spread throughout you and dress in some concrete thought. That is why the feeling is not absorbed in your limbs. There are also feelings that are not seen by you at all, but by touching them in the slightest and shaking them they pass and fly away. Stretch the vessel before your soul and spread its actions within you. Try to attach these feelings of <i>hisragshus</i> to tangible ideas. It is recommended not to begin with difficult feelings where the soul cries out from its pains and blemishes, but rather to begin with feelings of <i>simchah</i> that thrill and delight the soul.
What is the vessel for the <i>hisragshus</i> of the nefesh? The beginning of the vessel that contains the <i>hisragshus</i> of the soul is a strong thought. Through it, you will see yourself, endure, and yet grow in the strength of your awakenings. The <i>sefer</i> Imrei Elimelech (Parshas Bechukosai) tells us, “certainly everyone has thoughts of <i>teshuvah</i> from time to time … but only because our thoughts turn away and we become concerned with other things that the thoughts of <i>teshuvah</i> depart … therefore a <i>person</i> is well advised to pay attention to these good thoughts.”
Also in worldly matters we often find that if a man has a thought that disturbs him, if he occupies himself with a different matter then he will not be free to ponder that which disturbed him. His anger will not be aroused and the attribute of Gevurah (strength) will not be revealed within him. His disturbing thoughts will spread and excite him only if he provides them with a vessel of <i>Gevurah</i> and he then is able to fixate upon the man who wronged him. This will even cause his anger to flare up commensurate to the vessel that he makes for it, and it will be so overwhelming that he will not be able to hold it back. The attribute will not only cleave to his mind at the time when it wakes up, but he will find every stimulation waking up this feeling, and he will not be able to endure without having it spread throughout his mind. The thought will make an impression on his behavior, and the thought of how he was wronged will take over and grow even at a time when he is not wroth with his adversary. The same is true for feelings of love and all other forms of excitement.
It is also true with the excitement of animals. Whether they are consumed with love or fear, even thought their minds are greatly limited, still their feelings will cease if they are distracted by being forced into a different activity not connected with the previous excitement. For instance, if the excited animal is beaten repeatedly and then immediately given to eat or even taken for a brisk walk to a different place, it will no longer be excited by its anger because it has been distracted from the small amount of thought necessary for the excitement. It could be that a man did not have time to get angry during a certain incident, but upon remembering the incident at a later time he could wake up the anger that he did not have time for earlier. Not so with an animal, for in lacking such thoughts and desires, the animal can only get excited at the time of the incident and not after. This is true whether the animal got excited at the time of the incident, or whether it was distracted and never became excited. Once the incident that excited it passes, the animal will quiet down on its own. [We find with animals that harbor hatred for someone who mistreated them, that it will not be aroused to anger at any time, but only when the decision to harm its adversary has been guarded in its heart. You cannot compare vengeance and grudge-bearing to continual <i>hisragshus</i>, because someone who harbors hatred can lash out against the one he hates suddenly even at a time when he is not angry, but rather feeling joy or love for another.]
We learn that the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Binah</i> (understanding) gives birth to the lower <i>middos</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The Kaballah teaches of ten sefiros which are the spiritual roots of all that happens in the world. The attribute of Binah – Understanding is the lowest of the upper three intellectual sefiros – Keter, Chochmah, and Binah. Immediately below Binah, the seven lower sefiros begin, Chesed (lovingkindness), Gevurah (strength), and so forth. The seven lower sefiros are revealed attributes, and are called, the <i>middos</i>. Binah is likened to the mother who gives birth to middos of action the way a mother gives birth to children.</i> The source of the <i>middos</i> is not actually <i>Binah</i> itself, but rather the attribute of <i>Tevunah</i>, which is the lower half of <i>Binah</i>, and is therefore called the mother of children (as it nurtures the lower sefiros). Even after the <i>middos</i> (the seven lower <i>sefiros</i>) are born and revealed in the world of spirit, they continue to receive additional power from the <i>mochin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Mochin are akin to the vivifying light, a kind of intellectual-spiritual sap that enables growth.</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> that flows down to them through <i>Tevunah</i>, as is explained in the <b>Eyts Chaiim</b>. Our intention is not to dwell on the heavenly engineering of Kabbalah, but rather how these spiritual forces are manifest in man, and pertain to the service of God. In <b>A Student’s Obligation</b> we discussed the teaching of the Ari <i>z”l</i> that mans very thoughts are the manifestation of <i>Malchus</i> of <i>Tevunah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The Kabbalah sees the root of everything in the ten sefiros, so everything in man must necessarily have its roots in the ten sefiros that are the spiritual roots of man. Each of the ten sefiros and the five Partsufim (divine personae) is in also comprised of ten sefiros. Tevunah, the lower half of Binah, is technically a partsuf, but regardless of the terminology, its lowest level is called, Malchus (Sovereignty) of Tevunah (understanding). The idea is that the lowest level of understanding is a vessel which receives and contains all the power and light above it. In the language of the Kabbalah it is called “Malchus of Tevunah” and in the common language it is called, “a thought.”</i> within him. The birth and revelation of a <i>sefirah</i> comes through the level of <i>Malchus</i> within it, which is the last of its ten sefiros. Considering how the seven lower <i>middos</i> (the spiritual roots of our behavior) are born through the medium of the attribute of <i>Malchus</i> of <i>Tevunah</i> (the roots of man’s thoughts) and also considering how <i>Tevunah</i> (understanding) brings an additional flow of power to the <i>middos</i> in the form of <i>mochin</i> drawn from <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, we can plainly see the inseparable bond between thought (<i>Tevunah</i>) and behavior (<i>middos</i>). This behavior is strengthened and can grow only when it is given a vessel in the form of a thought in which to expand. Without this thought the behavior looses power and passes away.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">(The author provides the following footnote.) Several times in the Eyts Chaiim, and also in the Siddur’s explanation of <i>c’gavnah</i> (the passage of the Zohar recited in nusach Sefard just before the Ma’ariv service on Shabbos evening) we find that the revelation of the mochin of Abba and Imma quiets the middos. Only with Mochin, we are told “Chochma and Binah.” [Meaning, Binah, in her own place above the middos where the lights are great, and the middos are nullified before the great lights. Here we are not talking about thought. We already discussed the difference between Chochma (wisdom) and thought. The holy <i>sefer</i> Bonei Yerushalayim (which provides teachings of the Ari z”l) which we quoted in A Student’s Obligation, makes the following distinction between thought and Chochma, saying that thought is a lower level in the intellect, identified in the Kabbalah as Malchus of Tevunah, and the proof of this is that it is possible to think of letters and words that are completely devoid of any sense or wisdom whatsoever. The aspect of thought is called the back (“achoraiim”) of the intellect. Therefore when thought is drawn to the place of the middos it widens and enlarges them. This is not so with mochin, which are above the middos, usually hidden from them, but sweetens the middos when they are revealed.]</i>
Therefore, if you want to reveal and strengthen the wondrous <i>hisragshus</i> of your soul, you have to make them a vessel. Strengthen your holy thought by thinking about the kedushah of the matter that brought about the excitement. Do not dwell on the intellectual aspects or on the depth, but only on the pure, expansive thought. When you are starting your avodah, it is difficult to take a mitzvah that does not change over time, like prayer, for example, which you accustom yourself to every day, and be able to expand and strengthen your power of thought during its performance. It is better to begin this practice with a mitzvah that has some variability, like Shabbos, as it only takes place one day a week. Furthermore, you change into Shabbos clothing, you see all those around you also changed into Shabbos clothing, and the feel of the house is different after being straightened up for Shabbos. This is even more pronounced on Festivals like Pesach, so on Festivals it is even easier to strengthen and expand your thoughts. After you have succeeded in revealing and strengthening your thoughts through these kinds of mitzvos, then you can go and try to increase your thoughts of waking up your soul in every mitzvah.
You will ascend to two levels through the expansion and strengthening of your holy thoughts. First, your soul’s many experiences of holy <i>hisragshus</i> will not be in vain due to not seeing or feeling them. Rather they will go up within you and you will see and feel them as they expand and increase up to the point where they have spread forth throughout your whole body. And second, even at times when your soul is not excited on its own you will be able to arouse it simply by the force of your powerful and expanded thoughts. This will be true in particular with the awakenings that you have already experienced, for you will see that you can easily go back and rekindle them within you. Throughout the year you will rekindle the <i>yiras Hashem</i> that you felt on Rosh Hashanah and Neilah of Yom Kippur when you heard the sound of the Shofar. Every day you will be able to love you felt for God, His Torah, and <i>avodas Hashem</i> on Succos, Shmini Atseres, Simchas Torah, Pesach, and Shevuos.
Now when you see how the Zohar and other holy <i>sefarim</i> spend so much energy to stress the value of <i>avodas Hashem</i> on the level of man’s thoughts, profusely warning about them and saying that Avodah depends on their sanctity, you can now see how it was really this level of mental strength that they had in mind, the very thoughts imbued with <i>hisragshus</i> and <i>hislahavus</i> upon which the whole man depends. Though it is important to guard ones thoughts from all evil, for one needs to vigilant against destructive thoughts whether he is awake or asleep, still, this is not the kind of <i>avodah</i> in thought mentioned in holy <i>sefarim</i> that one can use in order to ascend to greater levels. This kind of guarding is important in order not to sully one’s self, but the <i>avodah</i> in thought and the ascent it facilitates can only happen through the kind of mental strength mentioned. Man’s fulfillment in avodah depends on <i>hisragshus</i>.
My saintly father, Rav Elimelech of Grodzisk explained in his <i>sefer</i>, the <b>Imrei Elimelech,</b> that a holy thought that only occasionally enters one’s mind and only for a moment is not yet called a, “thought,” and cannot be used to sanctify man and bring him close to God. This can only be done with a thought that a person holds onto for an extended period of time. We see throughout the whole <i>sefer</i> <b>Noam Elimelech</b> that when he tells the reader to exercise his power of thought, he usually does not say, “he shall think,” but rather says, “he shall imagine,” or, “he shall picture in his mind.” In the first article of the “<i>Tsetil haKatan</i>,” (a short collection of advice on <i>avodas Hashem</i>) Rebbe Elimelech writes, “He shall imagine and picture in his mind a great and awesome fire burning before him and reaching the heavens. Then, for the sake of God’s <i>kedushah</i>, he breaks his nature and throws himself into the fire as an act of sanctifying God.” He uses similar language in the second article. Also in Rebbe Elimelech’s, “Prayer before Davening,” he writes, “let our thoughts be refined, clear, pure, and strong.” This is indeed a great principle. Our thoughts should be <b>refined, clear, pure, and strong</b>.
It is impossible to have mental strength that does not contain mental images. In chapter 70 of the Tikkunei Zohar we find, “<i>nefesh hametsuyar</i> (the soul of the image pictured in the mind)”<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The version of the Ohr Yisrael and the Kisei Melech is, ‘nefesh ham’tsayeir – the soul that draws.” For image to be listed right after thought is just a way of showing from kabbalistic sources how concrete mental images are an integral part of mental strength.</i> enumerated right after, “<i>nefesh hamachshavah</i> (the soul of the thought).” The first chapter of the <i>Shemonah Perakim</i> of the Rambam tells us that when you divide the <i>nefesh</i> into sections, you only end up dividing the revelation of its actions, but the nefesh in its essence and in it self is still one (complete unity). We explained in <b>A Student’s Obligation</b> (Chapter One, Section One) that just because the terminology of the Kabbalah divides the soul into five parts – <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruach</i>, <i>neshama</i>, <i>chaya</i>, <i>yechida</i> – this does not mean that there are five different holy souls in man. Really there is only one. It is just that whenever a higher portion or greater light from that soul is revealed, we see it as a higher soul and call it by a higher name. This is similar to how the “Patach Elyahu” section of the Zohar,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The Patach Elyahu (Tikkunei Zohar, 13a) is a summary of the Zoharic conception of God. It is printed in Eydut Hamizrach and Sefard siddurim, and has even been incorporated into the synagogue liturgy, recited in many sefardic minyanim before mincha.</i> describes the sefiros - “one is long, one is short, one is intermediate” – and by this it is saying that difference between the sefiros is only a difference in degree of revelation and degree of influence below.
With this we can say that it is not the intention of the Tikkunei Zohar to say that there is a soul that thinks and a separate soul that forms mental images. It is rather that from the outset, when a man effects a weak action of the soul, then only a small portion of the soul is revealed in thought, and when he is activates his soul in a stronger way, then a greater portion of the soul is revealed that goes as far as to draw an image of the revelation. We mentioned in <b>A Student’s Obligation</b><sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 2, section 1, footnote.</i> that when a person has a small thought about an adversary who shamed him, the image of the adversary is not conjured up in his mind. Yet when he has a stronger thought, then he clearly sees the image of the adversary in his mind’s eye. With the stronger thought, the image will not just be a picture of the adversary, but the image will also contain things the adversary said and entire scenes involving the adversary. There we said that a strong thought and a mental image are of the same variety. It is just that whatever he can see picture in his mind, such as the form of a house or the form of a man, are visualized in the imagination. Yet things that do not take a visual form, such as words, are only conceived in a strong thought. We see evidence of this in the way people express themselves. This is as people sometimes say, “I pictured the whole scene in my mind, I pictured every detail, even what my adversary thinks of me, even what he plans on doing to me know.” Everything is, “pictured” in his mind.
The <i>hisragshus</i> of the <i>nefesh</i> is only revealed in the vessel of thought, and it takes a considerate amount of reflecting on how a person’s adversary wronged him in order to excite and reveal his anger. He will not kindle his anger if he doesn’t think about it. This is all to say that the revelation of <i>hisragshus</i> is dependant upon strong, expanded thought in particular. Just in the way that it is impossible for a man to expand and strengthen his wisdom except through filling his mind with specific and actual pieces of wisdom, and not just one but actually many different pieces of wisdom, so he can thereby distinguish and discern various matters of intellect, so too is it impossible to expand and strengthen ones power of thought as well as one’s mental endurance to hold onto an idea for a long period of time without filling his mind with many specific mental images which he can then use under a variety of circumstances.
One needs a mental storage of different mental images in particular. Besides the fact that thought and the ability to imagine cannot expand based on a single thought or mental image, it is also the nature of thought and imagination that they cannot tarry for a long period of time on one thought or mental image unless other thoughts and images are added to the mind. In this way it is also impossible to dwell at length on the evils that one’s adversary did to him without going on and imagining the thoughts and reasons the adversary had when he was hurting him, or how the adversary prepared himself before harming him, how he raised his fist to him, how he cursed him with certain cursed, and so forth.
Now we can say that when you want to reveal your holy <i>hisragshus</i> which passes through you on a festival or Shabbos, you need to strengthen your holy thoughts concerning that festival or Shabbos. And it is impossible to strengthen your thoughts in this context with just the simple thought that the festival and the Shabbos are holy, because you will not be able to dwell on this thought for very long or strengthen it. Rather you need to fill them with pictures and images and think on them with strength. Think about things that you cannot picture visually with pure and strong thought, and take things that you can see in your mind’s eye and visualize them as if they were there before you. Only in this way will you be able to reveal your soul’s <i>hisragshus</i>. Even at a time when it is not excited, you will still be able to wake it up to its excitement. The holy sefer <b>Noam Elimelich<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Parshas Lech Lecha.</i></b> tells us that if a man wants to arouse himself by his thoughts that he should visualize himself standing before the Beis HaMikdash fully built with the altar and the chambers all in order … and by means of this he will come to complete clarity and deveikus and be able to pray with total concentration, with fear and love, just as if he were standing in the holy of holies. He further tells us that not just visualize it as a strong thought, but should strive to see it as a vision.
When thought is accompanied by concrete images it not only activates man’s soul, but also manages to connect it to external <i>kedushah</i>, and draw <i>kedushah</i> from above to such an extent that the benefit and the ascent of the spirit that man will experience through this is immeasurable. We find this mentioned in the Ohr HaChama commentary on the Zohar by the grandfather of the Chidda,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">Parsaht Vayeishev, 192a.</i> where he says in the name of Rav Moshe Cordevero, “Study the wisdom that you learned from your Master deeply, picture it in your mind, and you will be able to cleave your <i>nefesh</i> to his <i>nefesh</i> … as Rabbi Abba told us in parshat Mishpatim that when he would think about and clearly envision the form of Rebbi Shimon, the <i>halacha</i> would clearly shine into him. This is the matter of cleaving <i>nefesh</i> to <i>nefesh</i>. An image will only be seized by the soul through a form that is stamped with physical matter. This being so, if you meditate upon this image, then the very image will wake up your <i>neshama</i>, and you will attain wisdom that you otherwise would not have attained.” Study this passage carefully and you will find that through the intensity of thought accompanied with concrete images, you will bond together with the holiness that you envision in your mind, and this will in turn connect you to higher levels of kedushah and a depth of Torah understanding that was hitherto inaccessible.
We have already presented a number of examples in A Student’s Obligation of how to bring out the <i>hisragshus</i> of your soul in <i>kedushah</i> during Pesach and the Eve of Shabbos. We discussed how to strengthen your thoughts in it, and how to fill your thoughts with concrete images of <i>kedushah</i>. Now we will add the example of the Third Meal of Shabbos. It is simply not possible to sit with a group of Chassidim during the Third Meal of Shabbos and not feel anything. Even if your soul does not tremble for the entire time you are sitting with them at the meal, how could it be that for at least one moment or another, during the singing, even during one verse, that sparks of fire do not shoot through you, causing your whole body to tremble and your sinews to feel the fire? If during the weekdays your hassles and ailments bore your mind and senses to numbness to the point where you do not feel your obligations to God, numb to the knowledge that you don’t just lead a worldly existence on earth but will even inherit hell in the world to come, Heaven forfend, as you never glimpsed at the holy ascents, for you are not considered free until you have gone up in ascents, nevertheless, on the holy Shabbos, when you can rest from all your hassles, far from you sickliness, with the additional soul of Shabbos and the great light of kedushah fills you from within and without, how could it be that you do not fret and groan for your years that pass by, week after week, amid commonplace humdrum worldly existence filled with nonsense and vanity? And as you grow older, with every day and every week that passes getting closer to your inevitable end, you are painfully aware that through you should be increasing in kedushah and coming closer to God, you are actually retreating and sinking into the bog. It may not be a bog of serious sins, God forbid, or ever the neglect of Torah study, but at least it is a bog of the dust of sin, such as neglecting <i>avodas Hashem</i>, wayward thoughts and suspect motives, which if left untended will weight heavy upon you as you sink in the mud up to your neck, God forbid. So how could it be that at the time of the Third Meal of Shabbos, when the Shabbos is going out, you will not feel as if you are in the midst of Yom Kippur?
The Third Meal of Shabbos is not just a time of fretting and groaning over the poverty of one’s situation, but it is a time of tremendous elevation. The great Tsaddikim said the hour of the Third Meal of Shabbos is actually that, “one hour of teshuvah and good deeds in this world,” that is, “greater than the entire world to come.” I heard from my father-in-law that my holy ancestor, the Kozhnitzer Maggid,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Yisrael, the Maggid of Kozhnitz (1733-1814)</i> once said at the Third Meal of Shabbos that this <i>seudah</i> was on the level of, “the Tsaddikim sitting with their crowns on their heads and enjoying the splendor of the Shechinah.” How could it be that even a stone in the wall would not radiate light if it were in Gan Eden? Wouldn’t even a stone enjoy the supernal pleasantness? And you, when you are sitting at a time that is more beautiful than Gan Eden, could you act as if, God forbid, it is not in you and does not touch you? It must be that your laziness is again seducing you again to say, “who is on the level of the Kozhnitzer Maggid, and all the other Tsaddikim?” Such an answer is the voice of the evil inclination within you, and God’s governance is in all dominions, for if the great Tsaddikim felt and delighted in God’s kedushah on the level of the head, then you, at least, should feel the kedushah on the level of the heels, or even the heels of the heels. But surely you do feel the kedushah of the Third Meal of Shabbos, even your heart and brain shake and tremble from the voice of a great tumult, the wheels of the holy Merkavah<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The Merkavah, the Charriot of Yechezkel’s vision.</i> passing through your soul, it is just that you cannot look at it and contemplate it, and so the thunder and the noise are lost to the point where you didn’t even notice that God just visited you together with all of His holy hosts.
Every man needs to look, think, picture, and imagine according to his abilities, and the way of looking at the time of the Third Meal of Shabbos could be described in this way. The whole Shabbos, a day entirely of kedushah, has passed. You have been sanctified from Heaven, and today you also sanctified yourself. You didn’t engage in business, you didn’t stroll downtown and look at the shops, and you didn’t act in a frivolous manner. Rather you sat in solitude together with your Creator, or sat with your friends learning Torah, discussing matters of kedushah and Chassidus. You had cleaned yourself from any dust or stain that might have come upon you during the week, and you strove to get in touch with your soul. Every hour you felt as if you ascended from a level of kedushah to a higher level of kedushah, until you reached the Third Meal, the pinnacle of Shabbos, the central time when the will of God is made known. It is a meal like the other meals, but you feel that it is not proper now to fill yourself with meat and fish, but rather it is a time to search for the God who hides Himself in a secret canopy, and to be sated by His splendor. You sit together with your friends who also seek the presence of God. You all sit in the darkness, for the “customs of Israel are as binding as the Torah.” The states of the body are suited to the states of the soul, and there is darkness and there is darkness.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">(The author, or maybe an editor, provides this note) See Tikkunei Zohar, Ch. 30, “there is darkness from the side of purity, and there is darkness from the other side.”</i>
In reference to God, the verse says, “He spreads darkness as His hiding place.” Truly it is light, but in our simple understanding as earthly beings we see it as darkness, for earthly beings cannot perceive God’s great light. The whole world and its fullness is nullified before God, may He be blessed. Yet once in a great while when you get away from this world and you get closer, step by step, to the time when God’s supernal will is made known in your mind and your heart and even in your senses, then at that time your body has to actually sit in darkness in order that your eyes and also your heart will not see the world and things of the world before them. God hides Himself in darkness. After searching for Him the whole Shabbos, you reach the fog which hided E-lohim. You sought and found the one whom your soul loves.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Shir HaShirim. This passage has a number of quotations from Shir HaShirim.</i> She gets closer to Him and melts in His holiness. The whole room is filled with the Heavenly Hosts, and you push your way through all of the angels and reach for the Holy of Holies, your soul yearns to enter within and go to the place where God is, hold on to Him and not let Him go.
If only you knew that you would remain like this forever, because then your soul would rejoice with eternal <i>simchah</i>. But then you remember that in a few more minutes you will be lighting candles and again fall into the days of the week, and this is a bitter taste to your soul. How can I fall from the heavenly darkness, this obscure and cloudy purity, down to the darkness of Egypt, the darkness of physical and spiritual turmoil all in one? You tremble and your anxiety is aroused. You feel them both now, both the end of the heights and the end of days – the end of the lofty kedushah and the end that is the poverty of the ordinary weekday. These two kinds of darkness are now fighting within your soul at the Third Meal. This could be told as a parable about a prince that is sentenced to be taken away from his father and put in the dungeon. Then, in the last minute before he is to be taken away, he comes close to his father, grabs him, hugs him, delights in him and yearns for him. In his delight and his fear his soul shouts out from the depths, “even if I go into the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear evil, for you are with me.” And his hands are almost trembling and searching, “you are with me,” I held onto him and did not let him go.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Shir HaShirim.</i>
See and consider how all of this passes through your soul, but you were unaware of it and did not think upon it. Could it be that such a state of the spirit could not leave an impression on you during the week? If you do not think about this at all, or if you think about it but either fail to fill your thoughts with images or don’t bring forth the visions of the revolutions of your soul, not weaving them into events that you can access in your mind, then the spark will be extinguished and the thought will soon melt away. Even at the time you have the thought it will not make a great impression, and all the more will nothing remain of it after it goes away. But if put your actions into your soul and strengthen your thoughts, then even if at first you don’t succeed in drawing elaborate mental pictures like the ones provided above, still you will manage to draw partial images.
For example, when you feel an increase in your <i>Yiras Hashem</i> at the Third Meal of Shabbos, don’t let it pass away or extinguish it so soon. Draw it out, make it last longer. Soy in your heart if not with your lips, “So strongly do I revere God, I revere the Great and Holy One! Isn’t he so close to us now? I so ardently revere the Holy and Unique One, the Creator of all the worlds!” Say or think these words with ease and comfort. Say them over again if you feel that it adds to and expands your <i>Yiras Hashem</i>. But take care not to just think the words that you are saying, but rather think of God, of his greatness and how He is the Creator of all of the upper and lower worlds. Then, at the time when you look with reverence upon the darkness in the room, then the verse that tells of the way God revealed Himself to Avraham should come to you – “with a dread of great darkness enveloping him.”
If you feel an elevation of your soul at this time, and “your heart is raised in the ways of God,” then think to yourself, “We are so fortunate, we have been granted such a great portion, and now we are so far from the world and its clock, separate from everything. We aspire to be only with the One who is Holy and his holy servants. We cry out to the Infinite and Measureless One and come close, singing His praises.” You look upon the room and upon the darkness which is now taking the whole world away from you, and you join together in seclusion with the Blessed One. And of itself the verse flashes in your mind, “and Moshe drew near the thick cloud where God was.” And you find your lips saying the words from the Shabbos <i>zemer</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">From the liturgical poem “Y-ah Echsof noam” sometimes sung at the Shabbos evening meal.</i> “Save those who do are late in leaving Shabbos, so its light will not be closed from them during the six days which receive their kedushah from the holy day of Shabbos.” Master of the World, spread Your Kedushah over us for the entire week.
One thing should be absolutely clear. Our intention is not to say that when the Third Meal comes along you need to free up your mind and ask God to send you holy thoughts and mental images. It is certainly not so. The main point of the Third Meal is to connect with God and pour your heart out before Him. You shall be immersed in this. Our intention is not only to reveal the pictures themselves, but to reveal the ‘<i>nefesh hametsayeret</i>” – the soul which forms mental pictures, as mentioned in the Zohar. Everyone has a nefesh that draws mental images based on everything it feels and everything that fascinates it. This is the source of dreams at night and fantasies during the day. The <i>nefesh hametsayeret</i> reveals man’s soul based on the input it is fed according to the dreamer’s life activities. If two elderly men who have been retired for many years see something new which fascinates their mind and excites their soul, then each one will spin and weave a different fantasy according to the life activities and thoughts that each one was once immersed in. Why should this be? Hasn’t it been a long time since each was involved in this work or business? It is because their activities reached their souls, and the soul was excited and transformed by the activity to the extent that each one’s <i>nefesh hametsayeret</i> revealed something within him so that even now it continues on its own to create fantasies and visions from everything that stimulates it. This is our demand, that this nefesh which draws images on its own will not only reveal images to us based on ordinary commonplace existence, but it will create holy images, and visions of kedushah will be revealed within us effortlessly, with no need for us to ask for thoughts and visions. God willing we will speak more about the methods and means of the revelation of images in the mind and the soul’s <i>hisragshus</i>, but for the time being we will turn to a different matter and a different chapter.

Chapter 5

<big><strong>Words Spoken from the Heart, to the Heart of the Young Scholar.</strong></big>
And now, young man, <i>Avreich Chassid</i>, we must diverge from our subject in order to discuss something with you in private. And do not be ashamed, for we cannot see you, and you cannot see us for the time being, only God sees both of us, and we are only speaking you from the pages of this book. Our aim is not to vex you, nor is it to find or reveal any faults within you, heaven forfend. It is a quiet, heart to heart conversation, a conversation of the spirit. My soul is speaking to its beloved friend, and yearns to help you to cleanse it. And they too, my heart and my soul, will be built through you. Perhaps by raising you up, with God’s help, mine will also ascend.
Some may become infuriated with us, saying, “what do you want from me? Why are you attributing to me all kinds of deficiencies and stains that I simply do not have? Why are you making my head spin with all this discussion of proper <i>hisragshus</i>, images, and visions? Aren’t I a Torah scholar? I would rather make my head spin with <i>pilpul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Intricate and logical Talmudic argumentation.</i> in the Torah as it was until today, because I am always immersed in the Torah. Even in the supermarket my thoughts are on the Torah. Am I deficient in my <i>hisragshus</i>, in my <i>hislahavus</i>, in the way I learn, do mitzvos, in the <i>hislahavus</i> I reach in all of these?”
Indeed we would not have had to answer you and go on any further with these matters if you are indeed infuriated in this way even partially, as you say that you are a Torah scholar, feeling <i>hisragshus</i>, even <i>hislahavus</i>, and are immersed in the Torah even when you walk through the supermarket. We said at the outset that we are only addressing these matters to the young scholar and <i>Avreich</i> who is worried about himself and his <i>avodah</i>. That is to say, we are addressing one whose spirit is lowly and heart is broken over his soul and his avodah, who says to himself, “doesn’t the verse say (Mishlei, 21:2), ‘every man’s path is right in his own eyes?’ And who can guarantee that I am going in the way of God in all my actions? Is it because my way is indeed proper and my path is straight, but then again it also seems to a man of wicked intent that his way is right in his own eyes. True I do the things that I do because the Torah commands them, but surely I have no lack of blemish and sin. The Gemara (Sotah 21a) tells us that (the performance of) a sin extinguishes (the reward for) a mitzvah. But still, since the Gemara follows this by saying, ‘sin does not extinguish (the merit of) Torah study,’ thus my Torah study is my guarantee. And yet, how can I be sure that my study of Torah is good and is pleasing before the Master of all? There are those who learned Torah in this way and fell together with their Torah study into hell. (May God protect us.) The holy Seer of Lublin once said that everyone who does not have thoughts of teshuvah before he studies Torah, of him it is said (Tehillim, 50:16), ‘But to the wicked man God says, What right have to you to declare My statutes,’ and in addition to this he gives strength to the <i>kelipos</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">“shells” meaning forces of evil.</i> [This is how the <b>Maor VaShemesh</b>,<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">Kalonymus Kalman Epstein, (d. 1823)</i> a student of the Seer, remembers the Seer’s explanation of the verse in Mishlei, “and she wakes while it is still night.”] Who knows if I had real thoughts of <i>teshuvah</i> and if my <i>teshuvah</i> was accepted? How can I be sure that I am not among those of whom it was said, ‘who gives you the right to declare My statutes?’ Being a Torah scholar and an <i>Avreich Chassid</i> means that my soul is in even greater danger, lest I lose my world to come in but a moment through the slightest blemish, may God protect us and save us!”
“How I envy the common man, the water carrier and the porter, who simply prays to God, reciting Tehilim and keeping the Torah to the best of his knowledge! What more can we ask of him – he does what he knows. I know how to serve God according to what I have heard from my Rabbis and my little knowledge of holy <i>sefarim</i>. And I know how a man is considered wicked before the Omnipresent at the moment that an evil desire wakes up in within him even if he doesn’t act upon it, how it makes him coarse and fills him with pollution. Shaking seized me and shivering crumbled my bones! I am so filled with shame and disgrace that I cannot stand before other people. If they could only see my hidden feelings, desires and thoughts, see me the way I see myself, then my shame would be too great to bear! The only way I can bear to be around other people is with the knowledge that they do not know everything about me. But I don’t know how I have the strength to go about knowing that God, King of all kings, the source of purity and <i>kedushah</i>, see me from head to toe. He sees my actions, hears my words, and knows my thoughts and desires. He knows both my small and great thoughts, whether at times of prayer or at other times. He knows all of the foolish things that I plan, speak, and do at every hour of the day. Everything I do, say or think is before His eyes.”
The <i>Avreich</i> is not always in such a low state. He doesn’t always see himself as a vessel filled with shame and disgrace. There are times when his soul is elevated, in the manner expressed by the verse (Divrei HaYamim 2, 17:6), “and his heart was proud in the ways of God.” It is not that he is inconsistent, sometimes fallen, sometimes elevated. It is just that for some, <i>avodas Hashem</i> is heartless, routine, and done in order to fulfill his obligation and no more. Such <i>avodah</i> is as hard as stone, one-dimensional, colorless, and monotonous. Not so for the one whose avodah is done with heart, meaning, fulfilled in different ways and in different moods, whether elevated or fallen, whether with dread or with love, in bitterness or in ascent. At a time when he feels far away, in particular if he feels that he made some kind of mistake, then his soul will be bitter. In his bitterness, all of the other mistakes he made in the past and all the poverty of soul that accompanied them come to the surface. In this case he will view himself as a vessel filled with shame and disgrace.
But when his <i>tefillah</i> was successful, in particular on Shabbos or a festival, or after a few hours of Torah study and <i>yiras Shamayim</i>, or after a conversation with the Chassidim while sitting together over strong drink, song, and rejoicing in God, when they have succeeded in connecting to one another, <i>nefesh</i> with <i>nefesh</i> and all their souls united with God, then his spirit soars in <i>simchah</i> and holy ascent, his poverty of spirit erased. His whole being together with his body then yearns for God’s <i>kedushah</i>. Then he truly feels that even his body has been sanctified. Yet even at such a time, he doesn’t become arrogant. His spirit would not become hard and allow himself to assert that he is lacking nothing in his <i>avodas Hashem</i> because after all, he is Torah scholar and a Chassid. At such a time his spirit <i><b>is</b></i> still crushed within him. His elevation and <i>simchah</i> would go together with his broken spirit.
This is particularly true after his <i>avodah</i> at a time when he makes a <i>cheshbon nefesh</i> (reckoning in his soul). He will remember how he saw in holy <i>sefarim</i>, or heard in stories about great Tsaddikim, or in the guides they wrote about <i>avodas Hashem</i>, where they casually mention a certain way of avodah or sublime <i>kedushah</i>, and we sit dumbfounded, soberly knowing that there is almost no hope of us ever coming close to such a level.
For example, in the <b>Noam Elimelech</b>, parshas Chukas, on the verse, “take unto yourself,” Rebbe Elimelech makes the following “casual” comment: “It is known to those possessing intelligence and knowledge that the first three blessings in the Shemoneh Esrei can only be said in a state of <i>mesiras nefesh</i> and unity.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">As if to say, you totally give your whole life over this and completely unite with God.</i>” Similarly, it is said in the <b>Avodas Yisrael</b>,<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">By Rav Yisrael, the Maggid of Kozhnitz (1733-1814)</i> parshas Ekev, “sometimes a state of <i>kedushah</i> a person undergoes complete self-nullification, like when we say, “<i>ayeh</i>,” in <i>kedushas Keser</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">In the Musaf service said on Shabbos, festivals, and Rosh Chodesh, we join in song with the angels and praise God in a section called, “kedushah.” At one point we ask together with the angels, “ayeh – where” is the place of His glory. The Ari z”l teaches that while saying, “ayeh,” one can connect with a tremendous ascent of spiritual forces in the higher worlds.</i> There are similar examples of lofty, great, and elevated levels which we find difficult even to imagine from afar. And now, what are we, and what is our <i>avodah</i>, if even in order to come to a kind of true <i>hisragshus</i> during prayer, or to feel <i>hislahavus</i>, we have to labor and sweat to the point of utter exhaustion, and even then our success is questionable. We are not only far away from their holy ascents and their heavenly states of consciousness. We are even far from their <i>Yiras Hashem</i>, their level of vigilance against the slightest thought of sin, even the slightest tinge of such a notion. We have not reached their level of diligence in staying away from lowness of spirit, and don’t exert all of our strength in holy <i>avodah</i> the way they do. In all these ways they are tower above us. Concerning this, the <b>Avodas Yisrael</b> teaches us, “even though the Tsaddikim would become soiled, meaning that they could be confused by a disturbing thought, of vain matters and the like, they would then clean themselves immediately afterwards through the power of <i>teshuvah</i>. They would remember this at once, regret the thought, and be filled with <i>teshuvah</i> the way one would do over a major transgression … It could be that they fall from their heights at the time when their thoughts are disturbing them, and then when they are filled with thoughts of <i>teshuvah</i> they rise up from their fallen state, as the Torah says (Shir HaShirim, 1:5), “like the curtains of Shlomo,”<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">See this verse, “Though I am black I am comely, daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Shlomo.” The tent of Kedar (exile) are like beduin tents which are black due to standing many days in the rain, but they can be easily washed and look like the curtains of Shlomo (redemption), splendorous an clean like the curtains of the Holy Temple. In this way the Tsaddikim, who are always connected to God even if they fall, have the ability to rise quickly from a low state to a high one.</i> meaning that they are always in a state of unity with the King to whom all peace belongs … Even their fall is in a state of kedushah and purity. God forbid that the Tsaddik should ever fall, but what is it but a momentary feeling of laziness in Torah study and <i>avodah</i>, and he cancels it immediately with thoughts of <i>teshuvah</i>, and it is as if it were never there.” Even in their fall they are far from sin or thoughts of sin. Their exertion day and night in Torah and <i>avodah</i> was so great that in their own estimation a thought of indolence [not actual indolence but only a thought of indolence] was considered a great transgression. Yet even in their fall they remain in a state of <i>kedushah</i> and purity, washing themselves clean to the point where you would never imagine they had ever been tainted.
When an <i>Avreich</i> studies a <i>sefer</i> in great depth, sometimes an illumination from the soul of the holy Tsaddik whose words he is studying flashes before his eyes. Sometimes this illumination is so great that it causes him to melt and experience self-nullification more than all of the <i>mussar</i> speeches he has ever heard. This is because he chastises himself, saying, “Wasn’t he also a human being? What is the awesome distance and difference between the lofty pinnacle of his <i>kedushah</i> and my lowliness? By mentioning this way of <i>avodah</i> and <i>kedushah</i> so casually he makes it seem as if it is not such a great elevation and not reserved for great souls and masters of spiritual ascent.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">See the Gemara, Berachos, 32b, “fear of God is a small thing for Moshe Rabeynu,” and the Mei Hashiloah on this Gemara, Chelek aleph.</i> Is it impossible to be a Jew? All the more so, if one is considered presumptuous if he calls himself a Chassid without this level of <i>avodah</i>, then who could ever be a Chassid? And I am so far away from even thousands of levels beneath this.” Thus at the time when the <i>Avreich</i> seizes and connects to God’s <i>kedushah</i>, he feels the elevation of joy in his <i>avodah</i> and path in Chassidus. This is because he doesn’t reflect on such accounts at a time when his soul is catching fire. At such times he is indeed rejoicing in God, but it is a joy accompanied by a lowly spirit.
Moreover, after he pauses from his <i>avodah</i>, he yearns for the illumination that shined down upon him from the upper realms, and in this way his spirit is even more broken within him, saying, “if only I could bring myself to such elevations once in a while. If only I could control my body, my desires, and my thoughts, stopping them from murkiness and lowliness, and bringing them to purity and <i>kedushah</i>. Then there would be some hope for me, as I could inch my way towards the heels of the Tsaddikim and fulfill Chassidus in some elements of my being. But in my current state this is impossible, because my “self” is separated and distanced from my mind and my desires. My mind knows what is good, and my desire wants the good, and then my “self” goes ahead and does the opposite right before them, as if my mind and desires were mad. Sometimes, even when I reach <i>hisragshus</i> and elevation, it seems as if it is not only dependant on my mind and my desires, but also on my “self.” When the, “self” wants it, I can achieve elevation. But if the, “self” doesn’t want it, even though my mind and desires yearn so strongly for even a little <i>hisragshus</i> and elevation that I cannot bear it, then my “self” will not go in that direction, but rather heads for bed and goes to sleep.”
“But I am not the only one who finds <i>avodas Hashem</i> difficult. The Holy Baal Shem Tov said that one has to use different tactics in order to get out of the hands of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> and come close to <i>avodah</i> and Chassidus. Now if only I could find the tactics that would suit me in my lowliness in the lowly generation.”
Our words are addressed to a young man and <i>Avreich</i> in this very situation, since in the course of his <i>avodas Hashem</i> he knows his deficiencies, and he truly seeks a remedy to help him improve. Furthermore, it is because the young man and <i>Avreich</i> in the doldrums of his search for spiritual maturity is prepared to receive and learn not only from someone who is more advanced in his <i>avodah</i>, but even from someone lesser that he is - in particular, someone who doesn’t give up when he fails, and continues to search his and other’s inner-self in different ways. But for some who hardens his spirit and claims, “I am a Torah scholar and a Chassid,” and even furies against us, to him we have nothing to say because our words will be useless. Regardless, we put our trust in God, and we will also speak to Him, for perhaps He will break the hardened spirit. Remember that he too wants to serve God, and he also exerts himself in his <i>avodah</i> and in his study of Torah. It is just that where the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> misleads another person in a different direction, here it misleads this particular fellow with an obstinate and arrogant spirit. It is a difficult illness indeed when the sick person does not even know he is sick! God also has an interest in healing these cases, it just takes more effort.
And now, furious Avreich, you have see the thoughts and the lowliness of the other Avreich, how he is justified in feeling lowly in all of his Torah endeavors. One needs to feel a lowness of spirit, asking God to show him the way to come closer. It is enough to admonish you by warning you against being too sure of yourself in asserting, “I am a Chassid, I am a Torah Scholar. My path is correct.”
We don’t have to dwell on this point at length, as we already find this idea in the Mishnah (Kerisos, 25a). “Rabbi Eliezar says, a man can offer an <i>asham talui</i> (a sacrifice offered in the Temple when one is not sure whether he sinned) any day, at any time, and it was called, an <i>asham</i> of Chassidim.” Here we find an explicit statement of a basic principle for the Chassidim. It is not just that it would not occur to a man that his actions are good, and all the more so not to esteem oneself as a Chassid. And it is not that his humility is so great that he does think his <i>avodah</i> has reached the level of purity required for a man of his important level. Rather, it is clear to him that every hour of his life he needs to consider himself as if he has committed a major <i>d’Oraysa</i> transgression for which he needs to bring a sacrifice. Witness the broken hearts of the righteous Chassidim in the time of the Mishnah, and how they taught us how to break our bodies and our spirits for God.
I will now quote the holy words of the <b>Avodas Yisrael</b> (Parshas Chayei Sarah). “<i>Veyih’yu</i> – and they were<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshis, 13:1 the first word of the parsha.</i> – is the numerical equivalent of ‘<i>zol</i>,’ which means, ‘of little value.’ When a person is broken hearted and embittered over his transgressions, and feels his life is of little value, in particular on the long nights of winter after midnight when he rises and is alone before his Creator, and admits before God that he leads a vain and worthless life, his years passing by like clipper ships on a windy sea,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">See Iyov, 9:26.</i> that he has not done anything to please God, to the contrary, his actions have been destructive and blemished from head to toe. And the day is short; he can almost feel his encroaching departure from the world, and he has come to stand in judgment for all the moments of his life. In this way he consoles himself, regretting his actions, and cries with a broken heart before his Father in Heaven. Through this he sees himself as worthless and miserable. “<i>Zol</i> – זל” or “of little worth,” is the numerical value of 37, the <i>milui</i> of the name Sa’g.<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">One of the expansions of the Tetragrammaton is יוד הי ואו הי , called Sa”g (ס"ג) as the sum of the ten letters equals 63. The four root letters of God’s name are Yud Hei Vav Hei, but the rest of the letters of Sa”g (such as the vav and dalet after the first Yud) are called the milui, or filling letters. If you take all the filling letters from the name Sa”g and add them up, you get זל, 37.</i> That is to say, he says that his heart is full of impurities.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">This is a play on words, as impurities, “sigim,” has the letters for “sag,” which is the name of God representing the world of Beriah, which is the genesis of the separation of good and evil. Above Beriyah, in the world of Atsilut, there is no evil and no impuiries, as in Atsilut, “He and his life are one, He and His causations are one.” This is a kabbalistic representation of the idea that the Avodas Yisrael is presenting, namely that the worthlessness (זל) is coming from the beginning of evil and impurity in the world of Beriyah.</i> Indeed, the main purpose of the confession before God (<i>viduy</i>, also equaling 37) is the abandoning of sin and the acceptance of the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven from that day onward. In this way he will not be counted among the wicked who are considered dead while they are alive, but among the righteous who are considered alive even after their body dies. That is to say, for the Tsaddik, every moment of his life he is prepared for that moment when he will depart from this worldly existence in a state of <i>kedushah</i> and purity. This is as the Zohar says, “the Tsaddik always thinks in his heart that today he may be leaving the world.” Indeed, people who led meaningless lives still have a chance to rectify their lot by waking up and doing <i>teshuvah</i> before the sun goes down. And the real sign of <i>teshuvah</i> and earnest regret is when a man remembers his many transgressions and feels his own worthlessness. In this way he receives a resurgence of life energy on account of the coming days when he will sin no more. For this reason <i>Veyih’yu</i> – and these were – is the numerical equivalent of ‘<i>zol</i>,’ of little value. (The verse continues) ‘Chayei Sarah – the lives of Sarah,’ The juxtaposition of the words <i>Veyih’yu</i> (representing worthlessness) and <i>Chayei Sarah</i>, is to show us how one who truly recognizes the meaningless vanity of his life is the one who is called <i><b>alive</b></i>. (The verse continues) ‘A hundred years,’ is the mystery of the Crown – (Keser). This follows because after the <i>teshuvah</i> he feels a renewed and revitalized will to serve God, and this new will is called, ‘Keser.’<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Keser</i> (Crown) signifies God’s will. It is also the tenth <i>sefirah</i> from below to above, thus, “a hundred,” as each <i>sefirah</i> contains ten.</i> (The verse continues) ‘And Twenty years.” Meaning, when it is carved into his <i>mochin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Mochin</i> – the intellectual-spiritual life force.</i> to serve God on the level of Chochmah (wisdom) and Binah (understanding),<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Chochmah and Binah each include ten sefiros, hence “twenty years.”</i> which are called gates based on the estimation of the heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">This is alluding to the passage in the Zohar (Vayeira, 103b): "Yet certainly, 'her husband is known in the gates.' (Mishlei 31:23) 'Her husband,' is the Holy One, blessed be He. He is 'known' and connected to every one according to how much a person estimates God in his heart. (The word for 'gate – <i>sha'ar</i>' is the same letters as the word for estimation – <i>sha'er</i>.) God is known in a man's heart in direct correspondence to how much he cleaves himself to God in the spirit of wisdom."</i> For this (Chochmah) provides guidelines for fixing that which he had corrupted in its way, and this (Binah) provided guidelines to fix in other ways. And then (once it is fixed in his mind) he comes to the aspect of (the continuation of the verse), “seven years,” which are the seven <i>middos</i>. These are the seven lower <i>sefiros</i> which he uses to crown God as the Sovereign King, through love (chesed), fear (gevurah), glory (tiferet), victory (netsach) thanks (hod) and connection (yesod).”
(The quote from the <b>Avodas Yisrael</b> continues:) “It is not so with the wicked, for their eyes are blind, they go around every day with their souls cut off from their Creator. They sin profusely, until from the prevalence of sin they grope around like blind men, trying to find a sin to add to their crime, considering themselves righteous, imagining that they are serving their Creator, forgetting the transgressions they committed, yet remembering the easy mitzvos they performed not only devoid of intention, but to the contrary, with ulterior motives and evil thoughts. For these they ask to be rewarded like Pinchas. We find the wicked boasting about themselves, “Thank God, I put on my tallis and tefillin, I prayed, said Tehillim and <i>Ma’amados</i>, I learned a chapter of Mishnayos, gave <i>tzedakah</i> to the poor – so who is as righteous and honest as I?” Of this it is said in the <i>haftarah</i> of this parsha, (Melachim 1, 1:5), “Then Adoniya the son of Chagis was boasting, saying, ‘I will be king.’ ” Meaning, “I” am God’s sovereignty, and I crown him. Thus (in verse nine) he slaughters sheep and bullocks and fat cattle, etc. For this his heart is filled with joy. He asserts that because he serves God he is free to enjoy all manner of worldly pleasures, eating and drinking, and his heart in not broken within him. To the contrary, he goes after his lusts (evinced by the name of the place where he offered the sacrifices) “by Eyn Rogel,” for the word Regel also means slander, as in, ‘slander on his tongue’ and in his arrogance and gluttony he allowed his tongue to speak <i>lashon ha’rah</i>, etc. Indeed, the opposite of this is and the way close to do God’s will in the way explained above is by means of breaking his spirit within him, and recognizes that he is truly far away from God. It is precisely by means of feeling far away that he brings himself close, and cleaves to his Creator, may He be blessed.”
It seems to me that we don’t have to speak to you any more about this, because these holy words have already done their work and had the proper effect upon you. But anyhow, we will add a few words and thereby fulfill the verse (Mishlei, 29:17), “correct you son, and he shall give you rest." The Gemara (Makkos, 8b) adds to this, “even if he has already learned enough.”
The Tikkunei Zohar (Chapter 10), tells us, “the study of Torah that is not accompanied by the fear and love of God does not ascend above.” And chapter Seventy of the Tikkunei Zohar tells us that both Torah and tefillah without the fear of God will eventually arouse God’s wrath. Furthermore, someone whose Torah study is inferior is delivered to the dogs, meaning he is given over to the <i>Sitra Achra</i> (the forces of evil).<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">It seems as if this is also from Tikkunei Zohar 70.</i> But let us assume, my dear <i>Avreich</i>, that your Torah study is of a high quality. If so, then you are very fortunate and God takes delight in you. But aside from Torah, we also have <i>avodas Hashem</i> which is fulfilled thought, speech, and action, and who can compare himself to the Sages of the Talmud who gave over their whole lives for the study of Torah? Regardless of this, remember the words of Rabbi Elazar, who said,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Shabbos, 31b</i> “stand before Rabbi Yaakov ben Acha, for he is a man who fears sin.” Then when Rabbi Simon said, “let us rise before him, because he is a Torah scholar,” Rabbi Elazar took issue with him, and said, “I said he was a man who fears sin, and you tell me that he is a Torah scholar!?” Since the man who fears sin is superior to the Torah scholar, Rabbi Elazar wondered why he praised him for his Torah study, and saying that for this they should stand before him, since he already praised him with the superior level of fearing sin.
Even though the Gemara says that Torah study has the power to both protect and rescue, protecting even more than mitzvos,<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara (Sotah, 21a) says, “A mitzvah protects (from suffering) and rescues (from the yetser ha’rah) while one is engaged upon it; but when one is no longer engaged upon it, it protects but does not rescue. Yet with Torah study, it protects and rescues whether while one is engaged in it or not.”</i> still the Gemara tells us (Sanhedrin, 106b), “In the years of Rav Yehuda Torah study was confined to Nezikin, whereas we study a great deal even of Uktzin. (meaning, we learned more) and when Rav Yehuda came to the law, ‘If a woman preserves vegetables in a pot’ — or as others say, ‘olives which were preserved with their leaves are clean,’ — he observed, ‘I see here the discussion of Rab and Samuel, whereas we, on the other hand, have studied Uktzin at thirteen sessions, yet Rav Yehuda merely took off his shoes, and it rained, yet when we cry out in prayer, none takes notice of us.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">When there was a drought, they would call for a special prayer and all remove their shoes. Rav Yehuda would only have to remove his shoes and the rains would continue. (Soncino). This is all in order to say that even though the later generation of Rava had a wider knowledge of Torah, the generation of Rav Yehuda was on a greater level of piety, and God would heed their prayers more than the generation of Rava.</i> But it is because the Holy One, blessed be He, wants the heart.” Rashi comments that the earlier generations were of a greater level of piety than we are. And the Gemara in Berachos (20) adds that the earlier generations would readily give their lives in the sanctification of God’s name. This is all to say that Torah study is not enough. One also has to be a Chassid, and this is the main point.
<i>Being a Chassid depends on</i> the heart, as the Gemara said, “the Holy One, blessed be He, wants the heart.” How does one become worthy of Chassidus and being a man of “heart”? It is done through self-sacrifice, or giving over your entire being for God and the Torah, as was said, “the early Sages would give over their whole souls in the sanctification of God’s name.” It is written in the <b>Beis Aharon</b>, “For this reason we call it <i>mesiras nefesh</i>, or giving over your soul, and not giving over your body. Only when one is put to the test with the possibility of committing heresy is he required to give up his life rather than sin. Yet with all of his <i>avodah</i>, all the days of his life, he gives over his entire being, including his thoughts, desires, behavior, and his body, to God and to his <i>avodah</i>.” And it seems that the Gemara is saying that not only a test of heresy brought about their <i>mesiras nefesh</i>, but even a simple transgression. And not even his own transgression, but someone else’s. And it is not that others wanted to kill him, but that he was willing to give up his life (for the Torah), in the case where he saw a gentile woman wearing a red head dress, and thinking she was Jewish pulled it off her head.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">The previous Gemara (Sanhedrin, 106) about the superiority of the earlier generations is also found in Berachos, 20a, and continues with the story about the red head dress.</i>
Consistent study of Torah is a great endeavor, but <i>avodas Hashem</i> is greater still. This means <i>avodah</i> in general, and, “the <i>avodah</i> of the heart, which is prayer,” in particular. Our sages, of blessed memory, said that prayer is greater than good deeds, and greater than temple sacrifices.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Berachos, 32b.</i> The holy Baal Shem Tov said that he only reached his level of <i>kedushah</i> through prayer. And not only <i>kedushah</i>, but even Torah and mitzvos needs prayer, just as prayer needs Torah. In the siddur of the holy Rav,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe Zts”l is probably referring to one of the siddurim of the European mekubalim, contemporaries of the Baal Shem Tov, such as Rav Shabsai of Rashkov or Rav Osher Margolis of the klois in Brod.</i> in the section on Chanuka, he quotes the Zohar which says that light is drawn to us through prayer which then enables the mitzvos that we perform to allow our souls to ascend on high. In this way the <i>yichud</i> (unification) is complete. They are indeed great, and it is difficult to attain such levels.
The <b>Noam Elimelech</b>, parshas Vayishlach, comments on the verse, “and I stayed there until now,”<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshis, 32:5</i> by saying, ‘I spent a long time doing this <i>avodah</i>, day after day, year after year. This is as I had said, and I had already entreated Hashem, and He heard my voice. This is in order to show that am man has to cry out for such a long time, ‘please God, help me to serve You in truth,’ and then God hears his prayer. But it doesn’t happen after a few days.” Rav Aharon haGadol of Stolin addresses this matter in explaining the verse (Shemos, 22:22), “if he cries out to me, I will surely hear his cry,” “why does the verse repeat the language (for the doubles the word for crying, “<i>tsaok yista’k</i> – shall surely cry”)? It is to say, how many thousands of times you have to cry out on every matter in order not to be deceived. [Meaning, he should not think that if he truly cries, he then cries no more.] Every prayer needs to be repeated many times to reach the point when he is truly praying from the depth of his heart.”
One has to work hard at prayer in order to reach the point when he is truly praying from the depth of his heart and <i>nefesh</i>. We quoted the Zohar earlier on which tells us that awakening also comes from the <i>nefesh</i>, but not all awakenings are the same. There is the beginning of awakening, and there is more than this, up to the point where one is worthy of reaching an awakening that is accompanied with true desire from the depths of the heart. But it does not come easily. The Stoliner Rebbe tells us that it repeats “until you desire,” in the Shir HaShirim twice<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">In Shir HaShirim, 2:7 and 3:5. It actually says it a third time in 8:4.</i> in order to tell us that everyone needs to desire over and over again until the desire comes on its own. In particular, strive to be able to wake up and desire by choice at a time when you need to arouse your soul.
<i>Avodah</i> and <i>tefillah</i> are indeed great, but they are not easily attained. How could you possibly think that you are already a Chassid and that you already pray with <i>hislahavus</i>? No one can see you, my dear <i>Avreich</i>, you are alone so do not be ashamed. We are not talking about dead prayers where no matter how much your lips move you still have nothing in your mind. At such times you don’t even remember that you are standing before God, calling out His name, and praying to Him. At such times you heart is not only far away from God, but from yourself. And we are not taking into account the times when you ostensibly prayed while only mundane and vain matter filled you mind, perhaps even including dragging along a repulsive thought together with them. You yourself know what they are worth, and what you are worth as a result of them. Yet we would like to discuss and consider your best <i>davening</i>, the times when you mistakenly claimed, “I prayed with <i>hislahavus</i>, I am a Chassid.” Look into your heart. Do you really feel fervor in <i>tefillah</i> and mitzvos? Could it be that you just want to force yourself to feel the fervor, yet there is no flame and no fire? Or perhaps you simply are not aware of what is going on inside of you, and for this reason you mistakenly claim, “I am feeling <i>hislahavus</i>.” With this in mind I will describe for you what goes on inside of you when you are <i>davening</i>, and then you can observe it in the same way you observe something that happens to someone else. Then you will also know that what you are experiencing is neither <i>hislahavus</i> nor <i>hisragshus</i>.
You want to pray like a Chassid, to banish any other thoughts from your mind and truly pray before God. You seek to reach deep meditation<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">The word the author uses is, “lasiach,” based on Bereshis, 24:63, “and Yitschak went out to meditate (לשוח) in the fields at dusk,” and our sages say that he went to pray mincha. “’Lasiach,” is no ordinary prayer, by a deep inner contemplative conversation between man and God, hence, “meditation.”</i> in your prayers, and would that you could have such deep meditations flow directly from your heart to God. You are resolved even to burn with <i>hislahavus</i> in your prayer. It seems to you before you start that it will be like this, but when it comes time to start, it feels as if a stone were weighing down on your heart. Since the moment of prayer is more auspicious than any other hour and this prayer is to be greater than all other prayers, you find yourself comfortable with your flow of thoughts, due largely to effort you made to prepare your mind and your resolve to destroy all strange thoughts from its realm. And despite all of this, no profound meditations of the soul fill your heart, and certainly no <i>hislahavus</i>. So great is your desire for <i>hislahavus</i> that you try to force it. In this situation some will <i>shuckle</i><sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Yiddish for shaking two and fro.</i> strongly back and forth, or pull the tallis over their heads and wrap it tightly around their bodies, or squeeze their eyes and mouth shut in a grand effort to force the feeling. Some will exert great pressure and care with the words of the prayer, wringing each word from your mouth, heart, and entire being.
Sometimes you feel a stirring within you at a certain verse or word in the <i>tefillah</i>. Since it is so brief and slight, passing like the blink of an eye, it is impossible to hold onto it long enough in order to ascertain whether it was really a spark of <i>hislahavus</i>, or just the heart’s bitter sigh over your humble state of being and the dryness of your prayer devoid of <i>hislahavus</i>. Usually you don’t even feel this stirring. But since you have spent so many weeks and months going through these motions in order to finally bring about a strong <i>davening</i>, in having grown so accustomed to anticipating the long awaited <i>davening</i> with <i>hislahavus</i> that is never fulfilled, you can no longer identify what in fact is <i>hislahavus</i> and what is not. Such a sense has been damaged and dulled to the point where you are mistaken by these gestures of yours and say of them, “this is the <i>hislahavus</i> that <i>tefillah</i> requires, as I am not a Chassid.”
Listen, dear <i>Avreich</i>, and listen well. It is not easy for a man to really look at himself. His is not even sure of what kind of sign he is supposed to be looking for in order to give him a clear and honest picture. When you are in doubt as to the identity of a physical material, there is a sign “built in” to the material that responds to the right test in order to give us the information necessary to identify it. For instance, if there is a cup of water before us, and we are afraid to drink it because we do not know if it is a cup of vinegar or just plain water, then we have a way to test its contents. Put a little soda in the water. If it bubbles, then it is vinegar, and if it doesn’t, it is water. The material is physical and so it the test we use to identify it. So no matter how much one is convinced for whatever reason that it is either water or vinegar, no one will argue with the results of the test.
It is not so with introspection. This is because one is not looking at something material, but rather something spiritual. And we are not referring to an intangible matter like wisdom that is dressed in a tangible garment, such as the famous cases in the Gemara of a witness who makes a partial admission<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">If the witness knows something that he is not revealing, his real knowledge can be inferred by the claims he does make. In this way an abstract intangible matter is revealed through a tangible and reproducible legal trick.</i> (<i>modei b’mictsat</i>) or the bull that gored a cow, where if one considers the tangible garment carefully he can reveal the wisdom in question. And furthermore, he can tell it to someone else and hear his opinion about it, in order to verify that his knowledge is accurate. This is because the truth is for everyone, and if it is true wisdom, everyone will understand it in the same way.
Introspection is difficult because it involves looking at a spiritual matter that is almost completely undressed by a material garment. Moreover, it is a personal matter, unique to each individual. Take, for example, the fear of God. The man of introspection is not looking at the word, “fear.” Neither is he looking at the subject of fear as an intellectual study. Rather he is looking inside his soul at the real effects of fear. Does he fear God? Is the <i>hisragshus</i> that he now feels truly the fear of God, or is it his soul deceiving itself? Such introspection is a completely personal matter, and its veracity cannot be corroborated with anyone else. He cannot say to his friend, “tell me whether or not the activity that is going on right now in my soul is truly fear and love,” and have his friend verify it the way he can with an intellectual matter.
If he only looks at matters towards which he is biased [and every man has certain biases], then his judgment will be clouded by his bias, and he will not see matters as they really are. Even if he uses a sign or test to evaluate himself and the validity of his <i>hisragshus</i>, they too will be distorted by his bias, and he will ultimately be fooling himself. This is because his sign and test are not tangibles, but rather personal feelings unique only to himself. He will identify the results more according what he wants them to be than what he actually feels. For this reason, introspection takes painstaking efforts even when using signs and tests. The real way to begin the process of introspection is with pure suspicion, the way one suspects every word and move of a thief to be a ploy. [This means he should only trust the results he garners at a time he set aside for an introspective reckoning, but not during his <i>avodah</i>, as we will discuss later on.] Remember what we have now told you. Bind them to your heart, and with God’s help, you will proceed with clarity on the path of <i>kedushah</i>.
And we will be giving you a sign and a test by which you may evaluate yourself in order to know if you truly feel <i>hisragshus</i> and <i>hislahavus</i>, but if you use these means through the lens of your own biases, then the results will be distorted, and you will not see at the truth.
We have previously mentioned a specific effect on your behavior which you may somewhat distinguish whether what you are feeling is <i>hislahavus</i> or <i>hisragshus</i>. If the <i>hisragshus</i> is so great to the point where it overpowers so you cannot hold it back or stop praying, nor even continue praying without deep feeling, then what you are experiencing is bona fide <i>hislahavus</i> according to our definition. So now that you have forced yourself using different motions<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Such as shaking, closing your eyes tightly, wrapping yourself totally in the tallis, singing, putting all your energy into the words of the prayer (which can also be done silently), the “silent scream,” and so forth.</i> to become emblazed, and it seems to you that you are already treading on holy fire, try to stop all of your motions. If you have truly reached <i>hislahavus</i>, then your emblazed soul will not allow you to cease. Shout, yearn, cry, rejoice as if pot is boiling over within you, as if an ocean is raging inside of you and thrashes you about with all of its power. Then if you are able to calm down, and the storm no longer rages inside of you, so much that you were not standing in prayer you would be able to hold a casual conversation, it is a sign that you were just trying to force yourself but did not succeed in reaching <i>hislahavus</i>.
This is not a way to gauge whether you truly felt <i>hisragshus</i>, because <i>hisragshus</i> does not overpower a man, as we have explained. Yet still, when you refrain from your motions you reach the point where you could have held a casual, mundane conversation, and such a change would not have caused you to regret or disturbed you in the slightest, then you were not even feeling <i>hisragshus</i>. For when an <i>Avreich</i> or young Chassid suddenly stops his davening when it has at least reached the level of <i>hisragshus</i>, his heart will doubtlessly be pained by his longing for closeness and connection to God’s <i>kedusha</i>, a pain not unlike the longing of a child separated for his parents.
Here is another sign. You must be aware that only the great masters of <i>avodas Hashem</i> are able to sustain the level of <i>hislahavus</i> throughout the entire prayer service. This is not so for the ordinary man, and especially for the beginner. Even if he has the formidable success of concentrating on the simple meaning of the words throughout his entire <i>davening</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">The morning service, Shacharis, for example, contains many pages of psalms and blessings, and takes an average of forty minutes just to say the words. As it is the way of even finely honed minds to wander, keeping one’s concentration on the simple meaning of the words of the prayer, together with remembering that he is standing before the Master of all, is a nearly impossible feat. This is compounded by the fact that the prayer service of the siddur is repeated by religious Jews 365 days a year, three times a day, with certain changes for Shabbos and Festivals. Though the pinnacle of avodas Hashem is to pray with <i>hislahavus</i>, with love and fear for God, still even without this, just concentrating on the words for the sake of Heaven is a highly esteemed <i>avodah</i>. See the Maggid Devarav L’Yaakov of the Maggid of Mezerich, parshas Ci Tavo, near the end.</i> still, he if he experiences sublime <i>hislahavus</i> or even merits <i>hisragshus</i> it will only be at certain points during the prayer. Therefore, look back after you finish praying, and if you imagine that you actually felt constant <i>hislahavus</i> from beginning to end, then you can be sure that you didn’t even reach <i>hislahavus</i>. But if you ascended mountains and fell into valleys, felt light and shadows, then it may be that what you felt was true <i>hisragshus</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">That is to say, <i>hislahavus</i> will be an ecstasy that that overpowers you and you cannot bare to cease from, but only at a point or portion of the <i>davening</i>.</i>
Don’t think that we are advising you to ask God to grant you <i>hislahavus</i> in your davening. Below we will yet provide you with signs and tests in order to know if you did indeed reach it (mums the word<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe may be implying that your hislahavus is not something you need tell people about, with the exception of discussing its meaning with a close confidant.</i>). We have already quoted holy <i>sefarim</i> that warn us against praying for <i>hislahavus</i>. Just concentrate on praying to God with strength and clarity, and the <i>hislahavus</i> will come to you. Furthermore, when a person feels that his that his prayer is fluent and his heart is elated, it is definitely not a time to make such accounts about whether or not his prayer was done with true <i>hislahavus</i>. He will be accounting rather than <i>davening</i>, and that is a sure way to douse the fire. However, if he <i>davens</i> come what may, without any accounting, then though he may even <i>daven</i> poorly, portions of his <i>davening</i> could still be elevated. But even if none of his <i>davening</i> is elevated, God forbid, he needs to remain steadfast in his goal, because the feeling will come to him, if not in the next prayer then in the prayer to follow. It is written in the holy <i>Beis Aharon</i> that the time of prayer is not the time to make a personal reckoning. If the evil inclination comes to a man to make a personal reckoning in the course of his <i>davening</i>, he should push it away until a later time, and then he may do it according to the advice given said above. Perhaps you fear that the evil inclination will trick you at that later time, causing you to believe that all is good – you are good, your prayer was pure, and you may dare say that it was uplifting and ecstatic. Such fears will only keep you in a deep blue funk, God forbid, with your soul in the grave without ascents or <i>hislahavus</i>. Such a low spirit is no match for the battle against the evil inclination, and the proper use of all of our tests and signs it is only in order to strengthen you in this battle. This is especially so if your spirit is hardened into asserting, “I am a Torah scholar, I am a Chassid,” and so forth. So in order not to while away your life in such errors, you are advised to only use these tests occasionally.
But remember this and remember it well. When you evaluate yourself with these tests and signs and you find yourself lacking, or even, “sinning,” God forbid, then you should be truly worried. Not just concerned, but groaning with bitterness until your heart melts within you. Scorn your despicable existence loathed by man and God. And nonetheless, do not remain in sadness. Though you must feel the bitterness and reach the point of <i>teshuvah</i>, it is nonetheless forbidden to remain in sadness, because sadness pushes you far from <i>kedushah</i> and the ability to serve God in general, and impedes the service of the heart (<i>davening</i>) and the way of Chassidus in particular. Undergo the process of <i>teshuvah</i>, and accept it upon yourself to amend your behavior from this point on, all the while putting your faith in God that your <i>teshuvah</i> will be accepted. The Baal HaTanya teaches us in the Iggros HaTeshuva (Ch. 11) “The moment we plead, ‘forgive us … we conclude, Blessed are You, O God, gracious and generous in pardon.’ Without the certainty of pardon this would be the case of a doubtful blessing (<i>safek berachos lehakel</i>), which the law requires that we refrain from saying for fear that it is a blessing said in vain (<i>berachah l’vatalah</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">Berachos, 33a</i> But in our case there is no doubt whatsoever, because we have asked, “forgive us, pardon us.”<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Tanya, English Translation of Zalman Posner. Page 381.</i> Trust in the holiness of Israel that is inside of you. Even if you have taken it upon yourself many times to correct your behavior and failed, still, all you have to do is strengthen yourself in your resolve to change right now, the light of Israel and its <i>kedushah</i> that is hidden within you will break forth, and from this time on you will become a Tsaddik and a servant of God. Haven’t you heard of such <i>ba’alei teshuvah</i> who lived a low existence for many years, and in one moment of epiphany manage to change and stand in a place that even the completely righteous cannot stand?<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Maybe give citation.</i> Worry, feel the bitterness, strengthen yourself, and rejoice in God. This is a great principle in the way of Chassidus.
May God have mercy and help us in this way, that we could be worthy of coming close to the Almighty, and bring you close to Chassidus, to understand, and follow on the heels of our Rebbes, Forefathers, and Holy Ones, whose souls are hidden in the treasuries of Heaven.
We will not now be discussing other private issues that concern you. As was said, our goal for the moment is to provide with the training that allows you to begin. With this training, you will know how to raise yourself up and become a Chassid, God willing. To this effect, we will only discuss the beginning, the beginning upon which everything else depends. This is the beginning of <i>hisragshus</i>, which is the excitement of love, reverence, and trembling in <i>kedushah</i>. Therefore, we have only to finish by giving you an answer to your complaints.
You take issue with us, wondering why we are making your head spin with all this discussion! You say that your thoughts are good, and even in the market your mind is occupied on deep matters of Torah. But here you are mistaken. There are indeed great men of Israel, who, being true Tsaddikim, are constantly occupied with matters of Torah. Indeed, but this is the level of the great masters, not you, <i>bachur Avreich</i>! I made mention to you and said, do not deceive yourself, and be not ashamed, for none see you now save God! There are times when you want to force yourself to think thoughts of Torah even in the market, and your first footsteps out the door will begin with thoughts on holy matters, but as the snows melt in the heat so will your thoughts of Torah will dissolve and be replaced by mundane concerns, and at times even shameful thoughts will ambush your mind, each one flowing into the next, one pushing the other away and one strengthening another, to the point where in the rush of their onslaught they will seem like an wild and degenerate mob. But remember, it’s all just in your mind.
The subject of thoughts requires additional explanation and more comprehensive guidance, as the Zohar and other holy <i>sefarim</i> tell us that the whole being of man depends on his thoughts. The realm of thought is a complicated terrain where man can be more easily overcome by the <i>yetser ha’rah</i>. We pray that God may enlighten us expand this matter fully at a later time, but right now we will give you some hints about how to guard yourself against its dangers at all times.
It is very difficult for man to work on his thoughts. It is not only difficult to direct them properly, but it is even difficult to identify them. When many thoughts race through a man’s head it is hard for him to distinguish the holy ones that need to cultivate from the adverse ones that need to be eradicated.
For example, a certain Avreich may not entertain disgraceful thoughts personally, but often thinks about the evils of a shameful and base person. He thinks about how horrible that person is or how nasty those kinds of people are, how the actions that they do are atrocious, the obscenities that come out of their mouths, God protect us, their appalling actions, and their vile words. He doesn’t only think about things he heard or saw, but imagines all the vile things that the base person is even capable of doing. It gets to the point that the Avreich actually groans out loud when he thinks about the villan’s lowliness, and starts to think about possible ways to punish him. After he goes through a period of fantasizing about punishing him and making him suffer, surely the Avreich starts to consider himself on the level of a person with zero tolerance for another’s evils, and intensifies his complaints and fantasies. He then resolves that given the slightest opportunity, he would take the initiative and see justice served, breaking the villain’s bones, ripping the hair out of his head.
“And if I am for myself …”<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">Pirkei Avos, 1:14, Hillel the elder, “If I am only concerned for myself, what I am worth?”</i> If I was with this Avreich at the time that race through his head, I would whisper into his ear and say, “all of these thoughts that you think about the other are really just your own. You are this fellow who you are obsessed about, and you want to do and say all of these evil things that enrage you, and at the very least you think about doing them. And since you refrain from such behavior, your desires and thoughts are cheating you and are dressing up in thoughts about the other in order that you may allow yourself to keep thinking about them. Look deep inside yourself and see that how difficult to stop thinking these thoughts.”
The Satan is a crafty deluder in these kinds of thoughts, and thought they may even be the slightest of the slight, they are very difficult to rectify, and even difficult to identify. If a person cannot recognize them, he will gradually be flooded with them, first by cheating him and dressing up in thoughts about the other, and later openly revealed in his own thoughts. His desires may even be emblazed by them, and he won’t even know what started the fire. This is because at first he thought he was actually guarding himself against them. Yet when he truly identifies them, he should grab them by the neck and bitterly cry out, “you despicable murderers! Why are you cheating me and defiling me, trying to throw me into the lowest pit of hell (God forbid)?!” One by one you should rage at them like this, and with God’s help they will not dare to cheat you by dressing up in a stranger’s clothing in order to defile you.
In general, with all of a man’s thoughts, if he cannot recognize what they really are in general and in particular, it is almost impossible to control them. It will even be difficult to identify them. There is so much more that we have yet to say about this, but for now, we will turn back to the topics of beginning <i>avodas Hashem</i> and <i>hisragshus</i>.
Our intention in this chapter was to provide you with all the information necessary to take and honest look inside yourself and know whether you felt true <i>hislahavus</i>, or whether not even a single feather of your soul was actually ruffled in the slightest awakening of <i>hisragshus</i>. We let you know how difficult true introspection really is, and suggested that you cautiously refrain from distorting your introspection through the lens of a personal bias. And yet, we are not sure if our words will be of any use to you if simple neglect and a lack of effort in <i>avodah</i> precludes you from ever listening to us. But still, it is hard to imagine that we need to suspect you, as we already provided you in A Student’s Obligation with a full exposition of vigilance and vigor in <i>avodas Hashem</i>, together with a condemnation of laziness or even laxity. Having applied this advice to your <i>avodah</i>, how could we suspect you of negligence, all the more so being that this chapter is addressed to an intelligent young man or <i>Avreich</i>? But we have no other recourse but to continue, as the facts clearly tell us that the <i>avodah</i> remains superficial when it should resound with super strength, a casually repeated exercise instead of a courageous show of exertion. We are not only thinking of businessmen whose minds are sold to their livelihoods, but about young scholars and Avreichim who need not worry about money as they are being supported by their parents. Even though they are taken care of and are not harried by the need to earn a living, still they do not want to exert themselves to the full extent of their powers in their <i>avodas Hashem</i>. Among them we find those whose Torah study is confined to superficial and simple matters, and when they come upon a difficult passage that requires serious mental effort, they will simple read it casually until they get back to an easy passage rather than sweat over its complexities until they arrive at a hard earned understanding. There are other Avreichim who indeed learn with fire, exerting formidable mental effort, but when they close the book and its time to <i>daven</i> or performing other mitzvos, all they do is go through the required motions of flat ritual. This is a wonder, as they truly want to hear, to learn, and to know the deepest of matters, both in the study of <i>pshat</i> (basic understanding of law and exegesis), as well as the study of Chassidus. The whole situation is triply baffling as there are even those among them those who truly want to hear strong or even harsh <i>mussar</i> speeches, fiery tirades to rouse them to improve their behavior. However, they shy away from a brave fight in the struggle to refine their thoughts, speech, and actions, and they don’t work up a drop of sweat in the effort to overcome their difficulties and become holy Jews. Their lack of intensity in <i>avodas Hashem</i> could be a result of an incomplete education. It could be that they have been accustomed already as <i>cheder</i>-boys and in yeshiva to put all their efforts into learning from holy <i>sefarim</i>, but were never trained to work hard at <i>avodas Hashem</i>. Or it could be that since the goal of fulfilling their study is so daunting that they give up in defeat before they even try. That is to say, since the whole purpose of their study is the performance of an earnest <i>avodah</i> - where a man binds himself in holy servitude and every fiber of his being serves the blessed One – that this inspires the <i>yetser ha</i>-<i>rah</i> to a greater attack against their efforts to even begin to serve God in such a way.
If this is the case we do not have to add to what has already been said, because the real point is translating the advice into action. More words will indeed give them delight, but it is only the delight in hearing and getting excited about fiery <i>mussar</i>, which is not much different than getting excited about downing shot-glasses of 120 proof bourbon, or immersing in a boiling mikveh. Such people delight in the burn on their skin or in their throat. Though they suffer and wake up, they will still not make any great efforts in <i><b>doing</b></i>. Take a hard look at the words of the holy Tsaddikim that we have quoted and you will see that the main point of <i>avodas Hashem</i> is the struggle to fulfill the advice in real actions. In the <b>Iggeros HaKodesh</b> of Rav Shneor Zalman of Liadi (Ch. 12) that “the term avodah only applies to divine service that is the product of a tremendous struggle against his nature,<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">The struggle is dual. It is both the fight against his unrefined behavior as well as the intense effort at deepening his holy <i>avodah</i>.</i> through which his own nature and will are nullified before God’s supernal will, may He be blessed, to the point where his exhausts all the power of his soul in Torah and <i>avodah</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">104</sup><i class="footnote">Shochet (Tanya, p. 455) renders this, “he abnegates his nature and will before the blessed Supreme Will; as for example to exhaust himself in Torah and prayer, ‘to the extent of pressing out of the soul.’ ” Shochet notes “Pressing out of the soul,” (mitsui hanefesh) is an idiom taken from Sifre, Deut. 32 (on Deut. 6:5)</i> Even with the greatest of the Tsaddikim we find that their level of <i>avodah</i> did not come easy, but was rather sorely won through constant and diligent work. Such work is not just the struggle of the great Tsaddikim, but a struggle needed for everyone according to his own level to arrive at any state of kedushah or purity.
Holy <i>sefarim</i> are replete with tactics necessary for reaching genuine <i>avodas Hashem</i>. “You fight the war with tactics.” This is a basic principle in the teaching of the Baal Shem Tov<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted in the <i>sefer</i> Toldos Yaakov Yosef of his student Rav Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye (d. c. 1782).</i> and was mentioned previously. The <b>Maor Ve’Shemesh</b><sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">By Kalonymus Kalman Epstein, (d. 1823), in Parshas Balak.</i> expands on this idea and says that each time we go into the <i>avodah</i>, new tactics are needed. This is because every tactic that a man uses to aid him in his <i>avodah</i> opens an entranceway on high in order to draw God’s light and <i>kedushah</i> down to man. This being so, accusatory forces are called to the offensive and seal up the entrances that he only just opened. He must then launch a counter-offensive with new tactics in order to reach his objective. See the <b>Maor VaShemesh</b> for more on this. Bear in mind that the tactical advice we have provided for you are not enough to last you your entire life. You need to continually devise new ones.
If it would occur to anyone that there is the possibility that he could devise tactics so effective that he would no longer need to exert tremendous energy in <i>avodas Hashem</i>, he is making a grave and dangerous blunder. The Torah and the <i>avodah</i> was given to man and not angels, because the laws of the Torah and the energy exerted in <i>avodas Hashem</i> is a struggle with the body and man’s inclinations, two things that angels do not have. God primarily demands the struggle. In general, the tactics and advice in acquiring the <i>avodah</i> are in order to win the fight. They also serve to lower the sublime and lofty <i>avodas hakodesh</i> down from its heights to our lacking powers and limited minds. Of course we cannot study and understand in the <i>pardes</i><sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Pardes</i>, Hebrew for orchard, is an acronym (P.R.D.S.) for the four levels of exegesis, Pshat (simple meaning), Remez (hints), Drash (deeper interpretation), and Sod (sublime mystery).</i> of Torah like the great and holy masters who had access to hidden knowledge. We are unable to either overcome physical suffering<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Through the mortification of the flesh.</i> or toil in <i>avodah</i> the way they did. Yet still we must use the powers that we are given, devote our <i>middos</i> and our intellects to the struggle for a holy <i>avodah</i>, and dedicate them as a sweet and pleasant offering on God’s altar.
If you are a man of avodah, a servant of Hashem who exhausts his energies in the study of Torah or the service of <i>avodah</i>, be it with your mind or with your body, or even if you are just now resolving to do so, then you shall be counted among the choicest and finest of our generation. You shall truly be called the wealth of holy Israel. Surely you don’t turn a blind eye to your deficiencies. To the contrary, you want to recognize them and to fix them.
But still I want it to be clear to you that even though no one can see you and there is no one to be ashamed of while you seek out your deficiencies in order to fix them and improve yourself, still, neither of us can no longer be sure that all of this advice and direction will have any effect upon you. Not that you will intentionally take all our words and toss them in the garbage bin, but you may actually do so unintentionally, and it would be quite natural for you to fall to the wayside in your <i>avodah</i> without even being conscious of the fact that you have fallen. Such an inability to see ones own situation is hinted at in the Gemara (Kesubos, 17), “Beis Hillel said to Beis Shammai, according to you, if someone made a bad purchase in the market, should you praise it and tell him that it was a good purchase, or degrade it and say that was a bad one? I would say that you should tell him that it was a good purchase.”<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">As he already bought it, at least make him feel good. This parable is an answer to the question, “if the bride at a wedding is ugly, do you still say, ‘what a beautiful bride?’ ” In the context of the Gemara, the question is really, should you always be honest even if it would cause another pain or sadness?</i> See Rashi’s explanation.<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Beis Shammai follows this with the principle of Chazal, “always let your opinions be pleasing to others.” Rashi notes, “to do to each one according to his will.”</i> Why does Beis Hillel tell us that we should praise the purchase even if it wasn’t worthy of praise? It is because human nature has it that a man feels hurt when he looses wealth. People don’t like loosing their money in paying taxes. But people also feel hurt when they loose a thing of beauty, like a finely painted vase, where the significant value is in the magnificence of the artistry and not in the worth of the raw materials. If another person comes along and criticizes the object, saying that it is ugly (provided that their really is at least some doubt as to its beauty), he will feel bitter about the criticism. This being true for an object, it is all the more so true that he will feel terrible<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Modern psychology might call this “denial.” For instance, a problem drinker will often refuse to admit that he has a drinking problem. When faced with criticism, an Avreich may refuse to admit that he has any problem with his avodah, and in a better case he will admit his lacks and grapple with possible correctives.</i> if someone derides his own personal inner value. And this holds true whether someone does this to his face or whisper to him unseen through the pages of a book. It is very difficult for a young scholar or Chassid to hear his inner character criticized and his deficiencies revealed, especially when he has decided that he has truly arrived in his <i>avodah</i> and even achieved some esteem among his peers as a holy Jew. The revelation of his lacks is an attack on his self-worth and his precious piety. It is hard for him to agree that he has a long way to go or that his thoughts are not as holy as he thought they were. When he was sure that his <i>hislahavus</i> in the way of Chassidus had burned all the way to heaven, it is disturbing to hear that it was neither a great fire nor even a little flame, or that even his simple <i>hisragshus</i>, desires, fear, and love of God is in need of serious repair. So at present, he is advised to pray simply, without <i>hislahavus</i>, but with great effort. In light of all of this, I suspected that you would both listen to us and not listen to us. It could be that our words make your heart tremble, and still you dismiss them with a wave of the hand, fanning away the tremor. A wink and a dismissive “Ha,” rebuffs any awakening that had only just circled you.
But if you have a heart of understanding, listen carefully. If I didn’t know of your talents, young scholar of the Torah, <i>Avreich</i>, or <i>Chassid</i>, whose heart yearns for Hashem and relentlessly cries out from the depths, “bring me close to You,” I would not have bothered going through such great efforts in explaining all of this to you or expecting anything from you. After all, we find the wisdom of the Midrash<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Rabba, Nasso, 7.</i> telling us, “<i>ayn mechazkin ela et hamuchzakin</i> – only bother strengthening men who are assumed virtuous, <i>ve’ayn mezarzin ela et ha</i>’<i>mezurazin</i> – and only urge to action men of motivation.” You are indeed among the virtuous and the motivated. And still, there is a man who has fire yet doesn’t know how to kindle it. Though his food is cooked he eats it cold in a cold room until he is himself is also chilled and even gropes around in the darkness. He may even cause his fire to go out. And when a man who knows how to use fire, he cooks his food, eats it hot, heats his room, and gives it light. This is you, <i>Avreich</i>. It all depends on you. The fire and light of <i>kedushah</i>, Torah, desire, <i>hisragshus</i> – it is all within you. You only need to know how to use what you have for your own well-being. I cannot remain silent when I see this light upon your head. I look at the pinnacle of the heights that you are prepared to ascend, and it kindles a fire in me as well. It compels me to speak to you. Arise and ascend, with your valor and with your strength, for God is with you.

Chapter 6

<big><strong>Becoming a Man of Feeling.</strong></big>
As we broke off our discussion in order to hold a private conversation with the <i>Avreich</i>, speaking words from the heart that needed to be said, it would be well to review the first four chapters and the concepts therein, and then skip the “private conversation” and go straight to the present chapter. To summarize; the feelings and tremors of your soul are constant and never ceasing. It may be enflamed with excitement for the Torah, mitzvos, and <i>kedushah</i>, or trembling from the bites and beatings you give it in when you feel down, but it is always feeling something. Though it surely feels, either you don’t feel it at all, or you sense something that you cannot identify. If may tremble from the desire to go the <i>shul</i> or the house of study, or it may tremble from being enticed after the desire to go while away your precious time in a bar or a restaurant. We advised you to create a mental file of vessels for your feelings in the form of powerful thoughts and images. These vessels will allow the sparks of your soul to endure in your mind and not to dissipate. Once they engender a tangible form you will be able to see them, correspond with them, and use them. We discouraged you from starting out by holding on to slight feelings that you either aren’t aware of, or feel only slightly. Rather you should start with greater, more prominent feelings, and this will eventually allow the slight feelings to flow from your soul into the more revealed areas of your brain and heart. They will be embroidered into the tapestry of your mind and you will be able to clearly visualize them.
The ability to strengthen the mind through visualization as a way to strengthen <i>hisragshus</i> in particular and <i>avodah</i> in general is such a crucial activity that no matter how much we say about it, we will still need to say more. So for now suffice to say that one can’t do without it, in all paths of <i>avodas</i> Hashem, and especially in the path of <i>Chassidus</i>. It is quite difficult for a person to control himself without a strong mind and an ability to reach holy <i>hisragshus</i>. A man can only excite himself towards holy activity and foster his own ability to ascend the heights of Chassidus if he possesses the faculty of intense thought and holy visualization [or as we said it earlier, intense thought which is itself holy visualization].
We have already quoted the words of Tsaddikim which speak of the importance of intense thought and matters of <i>avodah</i>, which tell us that only intense thought and the ability for holy visualization can a man succeed in <i>avodah</i>. At this point we can add to our discussion the words of the <b>Maor VaShemesh</b> in parshas Pinchas, and what they teach us in the ways of avodas Hashem:
How does a man refine the sparks of divinity in his soul? He must continually deliver over the power of his mind and body to the sanctity of God’s name, may He be blessed. This is true for the all <i>avodas</i> Hashem, whether it is the performance of mitzvos, Torah, or prayer. This is particularly true when one is saying the Kerias Shema ...
The following advice will help you to understand the matter of <i>mesiras nefesh</i>. While a man is alive, he cannot live without eating and drinking … but truly, the secret is that man needs to completely orient his soul in all of his activities so that they are given entirely over to God and to nothing else. This will allow him to “behold the delight of the Eternal” (Psalms), and his soul will thirst for the taste of God’s sweetness, companionship, and pleasantness. All the days of his life he will anticipate and yearn for God, asking himself, “when will I arrive and witness the light of the face of the Living God?” When a man who has oriented his soul in this way has disposed himself of all worldly desires and stands up to pray before the Almighty, he will feel his soul tasting a portion of the delight and pleasantness of the supernal light. With full force his soul will desire to cleave to the supernal lights. At the time when he feels such ardent desire he will even despise his physical existence, and if it were at all possible he would gladly and willingly discorporate his soul from his body and join it the supernal light in celestial union. His heart is pained that his soul is connected to the body, preventing him from ascending to this union. Yet at this time, the great burning fire of his longing to emulate the celestial beings serves to refine his body as well. Then his body also ascends, and then after he has finished <i>davening</i>, even though he doesn’t feel the desire with the previous intensity, still the experience will dissuade him from being inclined towards material things. Rather, even his physical activities, eating and drinking and like, will be oriented towards a holy purpose. And if he is diligent and consistent in his yearning, trying harder and harder every day to achieve <i>deveikus</i> with the Holy One, blessed be He, his body will become more and more refined until even his material life will become spiritual.
It stands to reason that many who read this will say, “isn’t this level of <i>avodah</i> too lofty a goal? It is only for the great Tsaddikim who stand with the angels!” True, we said at the outset that we are only striving to go on the heels of the holy masters, only wrestling at the dust of their feet and absorbing some of their way at our own level. And yet our eyes will not behold them or their great <i>kedushah</i>. But regardless, keep the following principle close at hand in your <i>avodah</i>. When you come upon a tremendous and sublime example of avodas Hashem in the course of your study of Chassidus, and you say to yourself in awe, “this is too much for me,” if your response is to distance yourself from believing that the <i>avodah</i> in question applies to you, then you may be sure that it is only the evil inclination tempting you in order to push you away from personal fulfillment, God forbid. But if upon hearing of such an <i>avodah</i> you say to yourself, “Yes, it is far above me, but that means that I have to find a way to hold onto a corner or hem of this avodah in order to connect to it and fulfill it with all my strength according to my own modest level of ability, and then God will help me to surpass my present level and rise up,” then you can be sure that you are listening to your good inclination and following the way of <i>avodas Hashem</i>. Is there any greater blunder than the claiming, “since the blasts of the Shofar are such a deep matter, containing such sublime mysteries far beyond my ability to understand, then I might as well not even bother fulfilling the mitzvah of hearing the Shofar?” Of course the Shofar is an exceedingly awesome matter. But remember; every mitzvah is an exceedingly awesome matter, but that doesn’t preclude us from the obligation to do them.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">God does not make His commandments impossible, or as the sages said, “God is not a tyrant with his creations.”</i> Notwithstanding the awesome depths of the mitzvos, everyone is beholden to fulfill the mitzvos in thought, speech, and action according to his present situation and abilities. And this is true for all matters of <i>avodah</i>. My father, the Holy Rav Elimelich of Grodzisk wrote in his <i>sefer</i> <b>Imrei Elimelech</b> that he heard from his father, the Tsaddik of Maglenitza, the following teaching from the Rav of Medzeboz:
Every man who desires <i>avodas Hashem</i>, may He be blessed, needs to tell himself at the outset of his <i>avodah</i> when he is still operating at an average level, that his efforts, sublime and holy as the sacrificial offerings in the Holy Temple, will raise the <i>Shechinah</i> out of the dust. He should not be a defeatist, telling himself, “who am I to reach such a high state of being?” For truly, “this is the <i>Toras ha’olah</i>,” (the ascent offering in the Temple that is burned in its entirety.) This is the teaching of man’s own ascent, and it is possible for every man to raise the Shechinah up out of exile (through his dedication to the path of Chassidus).
No one is exempt from such efforts, but is required to fulfill this advice according to his own level. Even down in the doldrums he should not desist in finding a connection, because this connection will bring about his very ascent.
Referring back to the words of the <b>Maor VeShemesh</b>, it is clear to everyone that God did not create him to fill his belly like a dog, or nibble at his vittles like a mouse – after all, God is the source of all purity and <i>kedushah</i>, beyond any names or descriptions! The point of creating us was to give us the ability to sanctify ourselves and come close to Him. When considering the big scheme of things, a man may think on how the days of his life are few. Then when his days on earth are over he arrives at the days of eternity. Knowing that he will remain for all eternity in the same situation that he chose for himself here on earth, he asks himself, will I forever be like a dog or a mouse, or “<i>l’havdil</i>” a thousand times over, in a state of supernal purity, by the Exalted, the Holy One, among the souls of the <i>Tsaddikim</i>, the angels, the <i>seraphim</i>. When even the simplest of men thinks about this, his entire body will shake and his heart will split within him. But reaching this all depends on the strength of his holy thoughts and (the purity of his) imagination. If they are indeed strong and holy, then the strength of the mental pictures created by his thoughts and imaginations and the expansion of consciousness that they produce will cause his whole body to yearn at that moment, or at the very least, to reign in his impulse for material pleasures. In this way he will come close, his soul beholding the delights of God, tasting the sweet and pleasant companionship of the Eternal. Even if his yearning is not with the intensity described by the Great Maggid in the passage above, he should still yearn as much as he is able, and his yearning will transform him. It will increase even more when he prays, and gradually his body will also be refined and ascend in direct correspondence to the intensity of his thoughts and his yearning. But if his thoughts are feeble, then even if he shakes and <i>shuckles</i> at the beginning of his davening, his contemplation together with his <i>shuckling</i> will flicker out like the last dying ember of a fire that could have blazed in glory up to heaven.
One who intensifies his thoughts and imagination in <i>kedushah</i> and <i>avodah</i> will find his experience transformed from the highest of heights down to the most rudimentary of levels. Besides the fact that his abilities will be head and shoulders above all the rest, more importantly, he will be able to rule over himself. He will be better equipped to feel the <i>hisragshus</i> of his soul, and better equipped to bring about his own <i>hislahavus</i> and the revelation of his soul, as has been discussed. The simplest <i>avodah</i> that everyone does and every word that comes out of his mouth in the <i>tefillah</i> will be different from that of his peers. Once done, your <i>avodah</i> will not be abstract and theoretical, only something above you or beyond you. Rather, it will be right there with you.
You are a real person so you need a real <i>avodah</i>, within you, around you, and before you. When a person’s <i>avodah</i> is theoretical, just knowing the reasons behind the Torah, even in the realms of Kabbalah and Chassidus, then he will have nothing more than a knowledge of the <i>avodah</i> without ever putting it into practice.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">It is like the difference between a music critic and a performer. (BE)</i> When he says the words, “and unto You all knees bend,” or when he says, “Praise Hashem from the heavens, praise Him in the heights, praise Him, all His angels, Praise Him, all of His hosts, Praise Him, sun and moon, Praise Him, all the stars,” he will only be in possession of a theoretical understanding. He will be left with nothing more than words on the page whose meaning he understands, because he is only pulling knowledge out of his mind. That is to say, his prayer and <i>avodah</i> will remain something he simply knows about, but really exists above and beyond him. Such a man will be divided from his prayer. He will be in the world of substance, and his prayer will be in a separate world of intellectual understanding.
Yet for you, it will not be like this, on the condition that you have brought forth and intensified your thoughts, imaginations, and feelings to the extent where you actually see them. And when you say the words in the prayer, “and unto You do all knees bend,” even if you feel only a small stirring of emotion within you at that time, still, you will see that together with the whole world you are bowing before God and experiencing <i>bittul</i> (self-nulification) before Him. And similarly, when you say the words of the Psalm, “Praise God from the heavens,” with <i>hisragshus</i>, then the whole world, both the upper and lower realms of creation which are actually right there before you, will heed your command to stand and praise God. Then you will all sing to God together as one. <sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">You will feel true “<i>bittul</i>,” no longer absorbed in your own wants and needs. Basic bittul is felt by a husband or a father in selfless acts done only for the wellbeing of his wife and children. And regarding Hashem, <i>bittul</i> means no longer just seeing yourself, but feeling beyond yourself and knowing how your being is not your own but as a uniquely directed part of God’s creation, sustained and led by God and His Torah. Then you go on to see how all other elements of creation are also following God’s direction, and are united together with you in your common bittul before Hashem. (BE)</i> It is not that you will see the form of angels before you. It is not that you just imagine that you actually see the sun and the moon, which are not really before you at this time. It is rather that your speech, thoughts, and feelings flow from the Almighty, take form in your life, and are concretely felt. You then feel their presence and substance so strongly that you even see them. “Unto you do all knees bend,” how sweet are these words! You and all existence in the heavens and on the earth below will then bow before the Living God.
You would be mistaken in your understanding of this if you conclude that you only see the fruits of your fantasies, saying, “I am only fantasizing about bowing down before God together with the celestial and terrestrial creations. I only imagine that we bow, fall flat on the ground, and sing before Him.” Take heed and hear the words of the Living God that speak through holy <i>sefarim</i>. If the Israelite serves God with an awakening of love or other attributes, even if he only fancies himself aroused with true love in his service, but it is not really happening, it is still good. This is because the holy inner dimension of his soul is truly aroused to God, and it is only his corporeality that hides the arousal. Once his body is also aroused to divine service, there ceases to be an impediment to the awareness of his arousal. His feelings are verified according (how much he reveals) the holy soul within him. The <b>Tanya</b> (section one, chapter 45, and the introduction to the “Sha’ar HaYichud ve’Ha’Emunah”) provides an explanation of the verse in Shir HaShirim, “my dove, my perfect one,” where the word for dove, “yona,” is related to the word, “ona’ah,” which means to distress or cheat. Thus, “every unification” in <i>avodas Hashem</i>, even if it cheats, still, it is whole and perfect.<sup class="footnote-marker">116</sup><i class="footnote">I did not see this derasha in either place mentioned in the Tanya, though the idea was presented in different words.</i> Also with this, it is not only the fruits of your fantasies, but since you indeed see it in with <i>hisragshus</i> in the imagination that have sanctified and intensified, then in this way it is true in all respects. God’s angels on high are all beloved, all pure, and all holy. The Ofanim and the holy Chayos make a great noise, the sun and the moon, the earth and its fullness, and you among them, all pour out songs and praises to God as one.
Even your thoughts of <i>mesiras nefesh</i> (giving over your whole being) during the recitation of the Shema will not remain intellectual or theoretical, but rather you will witness a concrete image. You will see a burning pillar of fire, and throw yourself into it in the sanctification of God’s name, as mentioned in the example from the “Tseitel Katan,” of Reb Elimelich of Lizhensk. Rebbe Elimelech tells us to, “envision, to draw in our minds.” This is not mere thought, but vision and picture. This kind of thought of <i>mesiras nefesh</i> is real, so real, in fact, that you feel it throughout your whole body to the extent where your body actually shakes from your leap into the bonfire that you have witness in your mind.
When God helps you to feel and to see, you will realize that this is not really such a great level, and it is not a level that you can only achieve with great difficulty.
Take heed and listen, and be not mistaken. We have already told you that our intention is not that whenever you feel something within you, that you should rattle your mind to find some sort of concrete image with suits your feelings. This is not at all our intention, because such activity will detract you from your <i>hisragshus</i>. Furthermore, the images that you garner from such a mental search are only a product of the intellect. Our goal, on the other hand, is for God to help us to see the soul which is higher than the intellect. When something comes from the intellect, it is a product of the intellect’s work in comparing one thing to another, or making an intellectual conclusion based on data. But we want to be worthy of revealing a spark of the vision of the sons of prophets that exists within us. Towards these ends we need to reveal and bring forth within ourselves intense thoughts and images of holiness. We have already presented you with examples from holy <i>sefarim</i> about how we need to draw holy images and see them as if they are actually before us. What we need is intense thought. Don’t be irked by baseless fantasies far from your holy soul. Rather, you shall only let images of the soul and holy visions well up inside of you. Then when you are filled with emotion and your soul that is hidden within you is somewhat revealed – when your hand and arm assists your brain and heart - then you share in the holy thoughts and pure imagination as witnessed by the sons of prophets. You will then behold real visions through your deep feelings of <i>hisragshus</i>, even through your <i>hislahavus</i>.
Deep feelings will appear on their own according to the strength of a man’s thoughts and imagination, whether at times of dread or times of joy. At times of dread intimidating images will appear to him, and at times of joy delightful images will appear. It is all according to the intensity of his thought. With greater intensity, the thoughts will be clearer and lengthier, more numerous and more effluent. And if his thoughts are weak, the images will in turn be weak and brief. We have already given evidence above as to the connection between thought and man’s actions, how thoughts are revealed and develop in direct correspondence to man’s actions. As was mentioned, when a man retires after many of a career in business or craftsmanship, even then, the new feelings that he feels within him will be seen in images based on his experiences while he was working. That is to say that by means of his inner experiences, the thoughts he had and the ideas he developed in his working years became so ingrained in his mind that certain thoughts and images will come forth by themselves even after he retires. This is all the more so true regarding your holy soul, which is a veritable spark from the sons of the prophets, where in the course of your spiritual growth you strengthen and expand upon your store of holy thoughts to the extent that you will witness enduring holy feelings embodied in concrete visions of holiness, thus intensifying your fervor and sanctifying your body. This will not only hold true for holy <i>hisragshus</i>. If you grow and strengthen your practice of intense thought, then even concerning emotions not directly connected to Torah and mitzvos, such as interpersonal relationships, business activities, and even mundane activities, you will find holy images waking up in your mind. That is to say, you will sanctify every aspect of your life. You will not be like the artisan or businessman who only gets excited about success or irritated by failure and mishaps, but every welling up of emotion will be fueled by the powerhouse of your intense thoughts, and you will indeed behold visions of <i>kedushah</i>.
Therefore, when you feel a stir of holy <i>hisragshus</i>, don’t try to devise fantasies or parables. Just wait. Contemplate the sensation of your <i>hisragshus</i>, and arouse it. Then the thoughts together with holy images will appear on their own. This is provided that you have strengthened and expanded your thoughts together with your store of holy images as was previously mentioned.
After evaluating all of this we come to the understanding that it is not enough for a man to reveal within himself the holy intellect inherent in Torah knowledge through deep intellectual reasoning. A holy intellect is not enough. You also need to reveal holy thoughts and develop them. Earlier we quoted the words of the holy Rav who said that thought is not necessarily a part of the intellect, because many thoughts, such as images, letters, and signs, have nothing to do with the intellect. What strengthens thought? The Torah, of course, for all of our existence is in the Torah. It is the sum total of our whole service and invigoration. Continue to study the Midrashim<sup class="footnote-marker">117</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash (plural, Midrashim) is the cannon of legends in the oral tradition.</i> in the Eyn Yaakov, and also the holy Zohar, for even a person who doesn’t understand the Kabbalah knows that the simple study of the Zohar sanctifies man. And after all, the Zohar contains many Midrashim that are in fact accessible to everyone. We already mentioned the words of the <i>Sifri</i><sup class="footnote-marker">118</sup><i class="footnote">The Sifri is the halachic midrash on the books of Bamidbar and Devarim.</i> at the end of <b>A Student’s Obligation</b> which tell us, “Do you want to know the One who spoke and the world came into being? Then learn aggadah.<sup class="footnote-marker">119</sup><i class="footnote">Aggadah is another word for midrash, both loosely meaning “legends.”</i>” Another Midrash, the Yalkut Tehillim, tells us, “when our tradition uses the phrase, ‘at the ends of the earth,’ it means the legends that sanctify the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.” Besides the fact that the Midrashim possess the special power to draw <i>kedushah</i> unto man, they also serve to reveal his thought, intensify it, and sanctifying it. The study of Midrash prepares man to be able to reveal his soul more. At the beginning of this book we quoted the words of Rav Chaiim Vital Zts”l, about how the beginning of inner revelation in man starts with the <i>nefesh</i>. Since man’s <i>nefesh</i> is revealed through the study of Midrash and Aggadah, so too the inner aspect of the Torah and all of its <i>kedushah</i> is revealed through the study of Midrash.
It is written in the Zohar (Mishpatim, 99a): “To what may Torah knowledge be compared? It is like a beloved woman, beautiful in form and comely to behold, who hides herself in her chambers. She has a man who is in love with her, yet no one else knows about his love, because he keeps it hidden. Out of his love for her he passed by her doorway every day, passing to and fro in front of her house, and looking in every direction. The beautiful woman knows that the man, drawn by his love, constantly passes before her door. What does she do? She opens a small window in her secret chamber, and stands by it, revealing her face to her beloved for but an instant, and then immediately returns to her seclusion. Anyone who happens to be with her beloved at this time does not look at her or even notice her, just him alone. And her sight draws his belly, heart and soul after his beloved lady. For he knows that it is the love that she has for him that causes her to reveal herself to him for that instant, to arouse his love for her.
So it is with the Torah, which is the wisdom of the heart, which goes around outside her house every day. And what did she do? She revealed her face from within her secret chamber and signaled to him, thereupon immediately returning back to her hiding. Anyone else outside the house didn’t see or know about this signal, only him. And his belly, heart, and soul went after her. In this way the Torah is revealed and concealed, going with love to its beloved, arousing his love.
Come and see! This is the way of the Torah. At first, when it begins to reveal itself to man, it signals to him with a hint. If he understands the hint, it is well. And if he doesn’t, he lets the Torah know that he does not understand, and the Torah calls him a simpleton. The Torah then says to the one who does not understand, “come close, and we will talk.” This is as it is written (Mishlei, 9:14), “(calling out to the passersby …) whoever is simple, let him turn here, and as for the one who lacks understanding …” The man comes close to her, and she starts to talk with him things according to his understanding from behind the curtain that conceals her, until he begins to understand a little more. This is called (the exegetic level of) “drush.”<sup class="footnote-marker">120</sup><i class="footnote">There are four levels of exegesis. “Pshat,” is the plain, simple meaning. “Remez,” is a hint of a deeper meaning. This is the signal or hint in the parable that the woman (the Torah) sends to the man. “Drush,” is a homily, a “fleshed out” exposition based on a series of hints. And the deepest level is “Sod,” or the mystery. The Zohar clearly implies that Aggadah as the body of writings that employs the exegetic method of Drush.</i> Afterwards, the Torah speaks of enigmas from behind a thin dress.<sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">The Zohar uses the word, “Shushifa,” which the Aruch translates as a dress.</i> This is called, “aggadah.” After he becomes more accustomed to her, she reveals herself unto him face to face, revealing her deeper hidden mysteries and all of the hidden ways that have been concealed in her heart from ancient days. (This is the Kabbalah and the mysteries of the Torah.) A man who reaches such a level is indeed a complete man, expert in the Torah and the master of the house. For certainly all of the secrets of the Torah are revealed to him. Nothing is far from him or concealed from him. She says to him, “look at the hint I once gave you. See all of the mysteries that are contained in it!” In this way we see that not even a letter can be added or taken away from the Torah. In this way we see how a man needs to be so careful to run after the Torah and to be a lover of the Torah, as was said.
That is to say that the revealed Torah, the very letters of the Bible and the simple meaning of its verses, are a garment for hints and mysteries. According to this we see how the inner aspect of the Torah is more greatly revealed in Midrash, and even more so in Aggadah. Then one may merit knowledge of the Kabbalah and a revelation of mysteries.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash could be defined as a larger set which includes both Drashos and Aggados. Drush may analyze hints in verses in order to derive an halachic or exegetic conclusion. Aggadah, on the other hand, which is a form of Midrash, consists of parable and metaphor, legend and myth, whose aim is to allow man deeper understanding.</i>
In the name of the Ari <i>z”l</i>, the <b>Mikdash Melech</b><sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">The Mikdash Melech was the first complete systematic commentary on the Zohar by Morrocan Kabbalist Shalom Buzaglo (1700-1780). Rabbi Buzaglo spent much of his life in London.</i> tells us that it is good to study Aggadah at night, as most of the mysteries of the Torah are hinted at in the Aggados. The Ari <i>z”l</i>, the great light of Israel, tells us that for this reason the Zohar praises Aggadah more than Drush. In the Iggeros HaKodesh of Rav Shenur Zalman, the Alter Rebbe of Lubavitch, tells us, “Give glory to Hashem your God before it gets dark!” He was urging Jews to get together in groups and study the Aggados collected in the Eyn Yaakov as the sun was setting between the afternoon and evening prayers. This is because most of the secrets of the Torah are hinted in the Aggados, and their study allows man to atone for his sins, as is explained in the writings of the Ari <i>z”l</i>.
You are highly encouraged to delve deeply into books of Chassidus. But the point is really that you do not only contemplate their meaning at the time you are actually studying them. Contemplate their meaning after you close the book and go on your way. And the point of your contemplation should not only be how to fulfill the directions provided in these holy <i>sefarim</i>, but also in order to sanctify and intensify your thoughts. A number of times we have urged you to do this in order to save you from embarrassment and difficulties both in this world and in the next. If you take this advice, then instead of letting your mind wander from meaningless to wanton thoughts, your mind will flow with holy thoughts and ideas. If you find it difficult to concentrate on the depth and complexities of the Gemara and its commentaries in the course of your day or night after your study session is over, you will find more success in this endeavor with Aggados, for they have the power to draw man’s heart. Such a power is also found in the teachings of Chassidus, which will more easily flow in your mind on that hour bus ride or in the fifteen minutes between <i>shiurim</i> and before dinner. If this is also difficult for you, it is understandable. It is so much easier to be a conceited loafer, God forbid, than to use your time wisely by reigning yourself into the good way and the path of Chassidus. It is all a question of training. If you accustom yourself to such study and contemplation, specifically in the ways that we will show you, then, God willing, after a period of habituation, your will find it impossible to spend even a moment without a thought of <i>kedushah</i>. Once you have trained yourself, you will see that should you walk down the street without a thought of Torah or <i>kedushah</i>, you will actually feel yourself guilty of sinning just as much as if you wasted your hour in the Beis Midrash that you had fixed for Torah study.
There are two levels of intense thought and imagination. The first level concerns intensifying thoughts of that which one hears and sees “as is” without any additions from the man himself. We will call this level, “simple thought.” The second level is where man devises his own additional details. This level we will call, “innovated thought.” In the level of innovated thought there are two sub levels. One sub level on innovated thought involves expanding upon experiences that he may not have ever actually sensed, but that he can understand, feel, and visualize based on information he has received through study and the like. The other sub level of innovated thought involves totally new innovations that he himself creates. One should begin by intensifying simple thought.
An example of simple thought has already been mentioned above in chapter four from the Noam Elimelech, parshas Lech Lecha. There a man is advised to imagine that he is in the land of Israel, praying at the Beis HaMikdash, before the fully built Altar and chambers of the Temple. We are taught that such an image will allow a man to pray with all of the clarity, <i>deveikus</i>, pure intention, love, and awe that he would have as if he were actually standing at the Temple. He advises man to envision the land of Israel and the Temple with such total mental clarity that he feels as if he actually sees it before him. During this visualization, tell yourself that you are an Israelite, and there were Israelites just like you standing there in the days of the Temple. In the exact same way that you are standing today, you could as well have been standing there in the days of the Temple. And it could very well be that God will have mercy today we will merit the rebuilding of the Temple. You really could be standing at the Temple today. Contemplate this with such intense thought that you actually feel yourself standing at the Temple and praying, and imagine the great intention, desire, and awakening you would feel while praying there.
Afterwards, accustom yourself to expanding your visualization. (Now we are going into the two levels of innovated thought.) You can do this by adding all of the details that you have learned about the <i>avodah</i> in the Beis HaMikdash and imagine as clearly as you can how you would feel if you were actually performing these <i>avodos</i>. Think to yourself that the Beis HaMikdash is built, and it is a place where “God is seen eye to eye.” Think about how it is a mitzvah from the Torah to ascend there three times a year for the three pilgrimage festivals.<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">“Shalosh Regalim,” Pesach, Shevuos, and Succos.</i> What is the point of this mitzvah? It is in order to behold the face of the Master, Hashem Tsevakos.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Hashem Tesvakos, the Lord of Hosts.</i> The fire descends from Heaven before all who stand there, and the Cohen stands wearing the Urim and Tumim, the breastplate arrayed with twelve precious stones with the names of the twelve tribes inscribed upon them, whose letters would illuminate in response to a question. All of Israel asks for their needs from the Holy One, blessed be He, and He answers them. Think about how once a year on Yom Kippur the Cohen Gadol would enter the house of the Holy of Holies, where he would have an even deeper vision of the God of Israel. Once when the Cohen Gadol came out of the Holy of Holies he said, “I beheld the vision of a compassionate elder dressed all in white, and it is a good sign.” (Yoma, 39) In another instance, the Cohen Gadol told us, “I saw Y-ah Hashem Tsevakos sitting on a high and exalted throne, and He told me to bless Him. When I blessed Him to be merciful with you, His children, He nodded His head (in approval).” When a man would stumble and commit a sin, God forbid, he would come and bring a sacrifice in atonement. A person would similarly bring a guilt-offering even if he was uncertain whether or not he had committed a sin, and the Tamid (continual) offering would make atonement for the rest of the sins that had been committed that day among the whole community of Israel, so in this way there was no Israelite who would go to sleep that night with an outstanding transgression on his account. It is in such a holy place of revelation that you are standing praying, praising, and meditating upon the Kadosh Baruch Hu. Your heart is on fire with davening. Your soul is emblazed with song before Hashem. You can use such a visualization while riding on the bus or when you are otherwise unoccupied in your avodah. And if you use this advice during your “down time,” then you will very easily be able to wake up such feelings at set times of prayer.
Don’t exclusively contemplate and expand upon these kinds of sensory visualizations. You are also advised to meditate and expand upon your appreciation of God’s greatness and holiness, even strengthening your contemplation on every path of <i>avodas Hashem</i>. For example, in the <i>sefer</i> of my holy and exalted Father (Rav Elimelech of Grodzisk), of blessed memory, he asks the reader to consider, “how even a simple animal fears and runs away from anything that could cause it harm. This being so, how could a man not fear the Almighty, who controls everything in the world according to His will, in whose hands are the souls of all living beings, and who has the supreme power to punish, God forbid.”
These words are enough food for thought to last a man his entire life and arouse his <i>yiras Hashem</i>. Here is a way to expand this thought. Perhaps at one time you or someone you know has been in a dangerous situation. Review in your mind the exact feelings of distress you had at that moment, and think about all that you or the other person would have done in order to get out of that danger.<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Think about what you might have promised God in order to save you.</i> Think to yourself, “Why am I not afraid at this moment that God will not bring such difficulties upon me?” Our holy <i>sefarim</i> are filled with these kinds of holy thoughts. Each vine from this great tree can bear the most wondrous fruits if it is only cultivated with care and love. Then all of your desires and thoughts - your whole being – will be filled and sanctified.

Chapter 7

<big><strong>More on Expanded Consciousness (Expansion of Thought)</strong></big>
What great heights you will reach when you strengthen yourself, expanding and refining your mental powers! It is as we pray in the “yehi ratson” prayer of my holy ancestor, the author of the <b>Noam Elimelech</b>, which says, “may our thoughts be pure, refined, clear, and strong.” You too can become a man with a holy faculty of thought and imagination. And not only in thought, but you will transformed into a man of feeling, an <i>eesh misragesh</i>, which we have already shown to be so crucial earlier in chapter three. For it is not only relegated to the level of thought, but it is rather that your thoughts will be so filled with holy feelings of excitement, love, fear, and desire, that you will truly be aroused by these attributes. You have made a vessel for your nefesh, so that the feelings that you draw out from the depths of your inner being will revealed, and in this way you will be going confidently on the path of Chassidus which leads to your being worthy of the title, “baal nefesh.”<sup class="footnote-marker">127</sup><i class="footnote">In chapter one we defined a “baal nefesh” as one who through his great vigilance in performing mitzvoth possesses and thereby accesses his soul by entering his soul into his devotion. There the author told us that Rashi defined a Chassid as a “baal nefesh.”</i> Can you measure just how valuable it is that your thoughts protected and not abandoned to all of the polluted notions that float around world civilization? It is our specific intention to instruct you with God’s help to indeed reach this goal, and to show you the ways<sup class="footnote-marker">128</sup><i class="footnote">Ways, “ofanim,” also means angels, and the author is using a double entendre in referring to the angels that will help you on your way.</i> in which to accustom yourself to such a way of thought and behavior without burning out from inefficient methods. If you follow this path, then you will be able to subdue your evil inclination so that it will not have the insolence to incite you in dangerous directions of thought. To the contrary, you will find these thoughts easy, thoughts which every man’s nature loves to think. Towards this end, we will continue to discuss the ways to reach this goal, and provide you with concrete examples. And we put our hope in God, that when you become accustomed to them, that not only will you not need to force yourself to think them, but there will even come times when you will be so immersed in them that it will be difficult for you to stop thinking them.
When your learn the Tanach try to be so involved in the holy events that happened to the extent where you feel as if you were there when they were happening. Join Avraham and Yitschak on their way to the Akeida,<sup class="footnote-marker">129</sup><i class="footnote">The binding of Isaac.</i> and feel Yaakov’s distress at the moment when he prayed to God, “Please save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esav, for I fear him.” You should also be so involved when you learn Midrash, for there are Midrashic explanations of the verses of the Tanach which reveal more about the events at the times they happened. From the story of Creation to the sale of Yosef, really with every event described in the Tanach, the holy Sages of the Torah revealed so much more about them than we could ever glean on our own. In this way the verses of the Tanach and the Midrashim will not be a separate, marginally connected study, where at the time you are studying Tanach you are only thinking about what is written in the Torah, and at the time you are studying Midrash your mind is only occupied with the homilies in the Midrash and sometimes with other verses, as Midrash usually looks at the matters in the Torah through the lens of verses in the Prophets and the Writings. Rather, make it all the same, unified study, for truly it is all one matter, so it needs to be one unified matter in your mind as well. Whether you are studying about the creation of the world or the sale of Yosef, or whether during your “free” hour or fifteen minutes (when you occupy your mind with the holy thoughts gleaned from your study), your knowledge should be a single unified whole based on both the descriptions in the verses and the homilies in the Midrashim. Don’t limit your empathy for and visualization of the events in the Torah to one Midrash, but rather make a composite of several Midrashim on the same subject, as there are often several Midrashim on the same subject found in different collections and different <i>masechtos</i> of the Gemara.
Take the example of the story of creation. One Midrash tells us how the Holy One, blessed be He, would build worlds and destroy them, then creating another world and suddenly it was not there, for God had again destroyed it in His displeasure. Another Midrash answers the question of why Bereshis 1:16 starts off by saying, “God created two great luminaries in the heavens,” and then continues by saying that there was a great luminary (the sun) and a small luminary (the moon). The Midrash tells us that at first the sun and the moon were equals. Then when the moon initiated a dispute and asking, “can two kings wear the same crown?”<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Apparently, this was the first dispute in the history of the world.</i> God resolved it by telling the moon, “Go and make yourself smaller.” This is another case of God creating and destroying, or at least, creating and reducing. Another Midrash<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">See Sanhedrin, 38b.</i> finds God repeatedly creating choirs of angels, asking them if they agree to the creation of man, and when they object (after hearing reports that this man creature will eventually act corruptly they say, “what is man that You are mindful of him?”), God “places His finger among them and burns them up.” Again, creating, and destroying. And finally, join all of these to the story of the expulsion of Adam. One moment he is dwelling in the Garden of Eden, and then the snake comes along …
By joining all of these Midrashim together, along with the verses describing the days of creation, you have created for yourself a single prolonged file of thought that stirs your heart, arouses your interest, and occupies your mind. When you accustom yourself to meditating upon this file of simple thought, try to raise it into the category of innovated thought. It will not be completely innovated, because the higher level of completely innovated thought will only come at a later stage when you become, God willing, a master of thought and wisdom. A mind with such a level of mastery produces novel ideas and concepts, showing a deep understanding of the pathways of <i>avodas Hashem</i> flowing from the advice and direction given to us by the holy rabbis of the past. But for the time being, your innovated thought will involve expanding upon and explaining the teachings that you have received. You cannot be sure if the expanded understanding that you derive accurately reflects how these events really were, but still, you need not worry about this as your thoughts are in line with the foundations mentioned in the Torah and the Midrashim. You are simply expanding your thoughts based on the sources.
Another example. Consider the impression that Moshe and Aharon made on the Jews when they announced the redemption from the slavery in Egypt. How did the Jews discuss the news in their houses? Didn’t the innocent, clever children ask questions when they heard that they were no longer going to be slaves and soon going to be free? Even after the exodus from Egypt the Torah counsels us to give suitable answers the children’s questions, each according to his level of understanding. Surely in ancient times children also overwhelmed their parents with numerous questions. That is to say, there were so many little scenes and events, questions and answers. Since the verses in the Torah and the Midrashim don’t describe such situations, it is up to you to imagine, that is, visualize as clearly as you can in your Jewish imagination, all of the events in the times of the Bible. Take the information in the verses and the Midrashim, and open them up according to the powers of your mind.
“And they embittered their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks, and all manner of agricultural work.” (Shemos 1:14) The cruel Egyptian taskmasters had no need of the buildings that they forced the Jews to build. Their desire was only to torture the Israelites and embitter their lives. Thus it was solely out of cruelty that they invented the project of having the Jews build the cities of Pitom and Ramses.<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">The footnote in the original text points out that the narrative first has the Egptians saying, “come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and join our enemies,” and only after that it says, “and the built treasure cities for Pharaoh – Pitom and Ramses.”</i> Building these cities was not the only way they tortured the Jews, but even after the cities were built they devised new ways to cause the Jews to suffer. The Talmud (Sotah, 11) tells us that in the eyes of the Egyptian, the life of a Jew was worth less than the life of an animal. A Jewish life was not only cheap when they sent Jews to the wilderness to perform life threatening task like capturing lions and bears,<sup class="footnote-marker">133</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos Rabbah, 11.</i> they scorned the lives of the Jews even amid the Egyptian metropolises. Every wicked Egyptian imbecile, every shameful Egyptian teenager, would brazenly curse and beat even respected elders of Israel, breaking their bones or even killing them. If an Israelite was physically stronger than his Egyptian oppressor it was no protection. He would have to suffer the blows of every despicable adolescent, because if a Jew so much as raised his hand to an Egyptian it would be reported and the Egyptians would slaughter large numbers of Jews as a collective punishment. There were few Jews who did not go about with broken bones, if not tokens of their oppressors affections in wanton beatings in the street, then surely from being forced to do labor far beyond their physical abilities.<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash, and Yalkut, Parshas Yitro, Remez 276.</i> They would beat them until their bodies were covered with bruises and lesions, making the Jews thoroughly abhorred.
“Come let us deal with them cleverly.” (Shemos, 1) This became the Egyptians obsession, their single thought day and night, a harrowing mantra clinging to their lips. And truly they invested all their wisdom and craftiness in devising more and more painful tortures to embitter the Israelites, as if they had no other reason to live other than to torment the Jews. This became the <i>raison d’etre</i> for the both the young and the old, from the simple Egyptian in the street to the kings in their palaces. If a few days passed without seeing the invention of a new clever means of torment, they would simply increase their workload and demand impossible tasks. For instance, they would make the men perform the tasks of the women and the women do the labor of the men. (Sotah, 11)
“Even the bird has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself.” (Tehillim, 84) In those dark days, the birds may have found rest, but the son of Israel, crushed by labor from the crowing of the cock, his body bruised and his bones beaten each endless day, was not allowed to go home at night. He had to sleep in the fields, with a pillow of clay and mud for a blanket.<sup class="footnote-marker">135</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos Rabbah 1.</i> This was their lot until Moshe came and made and arrangement with the rulers allowing the Jews to rest on Shabbos. Rest, yes, but not necessarily to go home. Many a mother or father did not know his child, and many a child his parents, for they could not go home for months or years, only wasting away day and night in the fields, in the factories of brick and clay, degraded, chased, and beaten.
The rouge snakes dealt so wisely, so deceitfully with the children of Israel as to break their spirits as well as their bodies. It was not enough for their sadistic hearts that the Jews dreaded the never ending word of clay and bricks,<sup class="footnote-marker">136</sup><i class="footnote">Shir HaShirim Rabbah, Parsha Number 10.</i> but they had to degrade them. Those who generations earlier had come to the land of Egypt as honored princes were put to work cleaning the streets and markets. And the pure religion they had inherited from the holy Patriarchs was scorned and derided.<sup class="footnote-marker">137</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar, Shemos, 15a.</i>
The evil decrees flowed one from another, and no sooner had the first come to the end when the second and third came rushing in. It seemed to the Israelite as if the sun had been extinguished in the sky. He would look to the earth and behold unbearable dread, distress, darkness, and gloom. It was as if all the evil of the world, from the depths of the sea to beyond the mountains of darkness assembled together in Egypt like an angry mob, united in its resolve to do away with the Jews. The forces of evil fell upon them, oppressing and harassing them to crush the last ounce of their strength. If Pharaoh was corpulent and in good spirits, he would decree evil upon the Israelites in order to take pleasure in their pain and enjoyment in their degradation. And if he were sickly and leprous (as indeed happened in one of the plagues), the Jews hoped that it would humble his closed, murderous heart. Yet it only bolstered his wickedness. He decreed that one hundred and fifty Jewish children be slaughtered by day and one hundred and fifty by night, and proceeded to bathe his loathsome, impure flesh in the blood of those pure angels. Heavenly court! Assess the situation. Look at all the actions of men from the days that they first walked the earth. Afterwards you will testify that from the day that God created the world you have never seen such inhumanity. You will join the human witnesses in their shock, speechless and ashamed to complain about their own travails, for when he knows about the bitterness of our suffering in Egypt he will be naturally silenced from being able to mention his own suffering. Stand, heavens. Let your accusations roar like the thunder. For have you ever witnessed man or wild beast as cruel as our oppressors who tore innocent children from their mothers laps, from their fathers’ arms, to slaughter them? And you, earth. How does the blood that you have soaked up since then compare? Have you ever bore such evil? So why don’t you tear apart and crumble into the abyss rather than being an accomplice to such wickedness, hiding within you the murdered bodies of the people of God? Earth, O Earth! Don’t cover our blood!
We have received from our forefathers, as they did from theirs, that these were not low curs that even a young upstart Egyptian could deride and ridicule. They came to Egypt as noblemen, lieutenants to the Patriarchs. The highest ranks of the Egyptians accepted them with pride and honor, for their elder Yosef was the viceroy over all of Egypt, saving their land from famine and death. But the Egyptians did not mention or even remember Yosef or the other elders of Israel who did such a great service to Egypt. Rather their minds and hearts were united in decimating the Israelites.
The Egyptians did not remember how the Israelites were the sons of kings, and from the severity of their oppression the children of Israel also forgot their noble and holy lineage. Such amnesia succeeded to transform them into broken slaves. Yet back in their houses, a moment of rest managed to restore their gentle, noble spirits, by which they could briefly transcend their misery. On Shabbos they would learn the scrolls of prophecy that they had inherited from their forefathers, reassuring them of God’s promise of redemption. At this time their souls were invigorated, ascending out of the slavery. It was then that they were aware of their true situation. They were princes held by wild captors.<sup class="footnote-marker">138</sup><i class="footnote">The Zohar (Vayira, 26b) says that “even though they suffered from harsh labor … they were kings.” (Note in original Hebrew text.)</i> But they only had to step outside and see how a foul smelling Egyptian garbage picker, avoided by even the mangiest dog, would deride, curse, and beat the Israelite, and this realization was forgotten.
After the conclusion of Shabbos, in the wee hours of the morning, when the crazed shouts of the taskmaster terrorized them with threats of beatings if they didn’t appear immediately back at work, their nobility melted away and their holy spirits dissipated into thin air. Again, they were broken slaves. Truly they believed that God would redeem them, but one look at the bitter desperateness of their situation managed to banish any pride of past glory or glimmer of future hope far away to a remote world. Yes, they would think to themselves, they were pure, holy noblemen, , but this was in the past, like the good their souls enjoyed in heaven before they were yet born, when the candle cast a halo over their heads. Their hopes of redemption even faded further and further away, as if to a different world, while they were captive in this world, a world where Pharaoh was the mighty king, his men their powerful taskmasters, and they where the scorned children of Israel, their spirits crushed and their bodies broken. Who among them would endure the suffering and live to see their salvation? They had faith, and they were despondent, but their despondency and utter loss of hope did not result from a lack of faith. It came from the degree to which their spirits were crushed, for to believe a man need a strong sense of his self, and a soul with which to believe. But their sense of self was trampled and their souls melted. The essential ingredient that faith required was lost, and the man who could otherwise have hoped was dashed. At the times when they read their scrolls which promised redemption the spirit of Israel would well up within them and their faith was renewed, but when the oppression intensified they fell and their newly renewed faith was shattered. “They did not heed Moshe from the anguish of their spirit and cruel bondage.” (Shemos, 6:9)
It was in the midst of such anguish when Moshe Rabeynu and Aharon HaCohen came to them, the voice of God calling from them and saying, “I have taken account of you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. I said [therefore that] I will take you up from the Egypt servitude … to a land flowing with milk and honey.” (Shemos, 3:16) Even the cold spirited and weak of faith among them could not have doubted these words, as everyone could see that it was not Moshe who was speaking, but God speaking through him. But just as there are those who are blinded by the sun, groping around at high noon as a man would grope about in the gloom of night, so deep was their depression and so crushed their spirit from the torment of slavery. So in order to reach these poor souls, Moshe and Aharon gave Israel the first sign and the last sign. Thus they all beheld the wonders of God, the God of Avraham, Yitschak, and Yaakov. They all bowed down in admission and acceptance before the God who saw their poverty, descending from the highest heights to save them from the lowest of depths. They spoke to each other, “could it be?” – besides themselves with wonderment and joy.
With what immeasurable excitement would a man come home to his wife and children and tell them of the mighty and wondrous signs of the changing of the times that he had just heard of, or even witnessed himself. They would speak and describe to each other what this impending redemption would be like, and what they needed to do in order to prepare themselves for their journey to freedom.
A terror-stricken child undoubtedly asked his parents, “Abba, Imma, how can we leave, for the taskmaster will come and beat us! Remember, Abba, that time when you weren’t so fast in waking up to go to work, and how the boss came and beat you. You were sick and hurting for weeks! You were in so much pain, you could barely sleep at night! Abba, I’m scared!”
Then his father, overwhelmed with excitement, said to his son, “Don’t worry, my son. Do you think that the taskmaster has any power to hurt us now that the Almighty has come and desires to save us?”
Still, the innocent child cried and continued to ask, “Why is it that God waited so long to save us? Why did we suffer for so long without him coming to save us before? Why didn’t God save my friend from next door? Don’t you remember how they took him and crushed him in the building after they saw that his father couldn’t finish his day’s work? Don’t you remember how his whole body was stuck in the wall with all that clay and the bricks and only his mouth showing, screaming as they crushed him! Oy my friend, my good friend,” the boy broke down and cried even stronger.
“I can still hear how with his last breath he cried out to his parents, ‘Abba, Imma, save me, help me! I can’t take it any longer.’ And he even called out to me to get him out of there. It was horrible, so horrible when they threw that last brick on him and it broke his skull. If Imma hadn’t taken me home in such a hurry, I would have given my life to save him, I loved him so, I would have been willing to be crushed by those bricks if only he could have been spared! Why didn’t God have mercy on him?!”
The boy was sobbing uncontrollably. Then his mother, one of the righteous women enslaved in Egypt, took her son in her arms as his father fetched him a cup of water. “Listen, my sweet, listen, my dearest one, shhh, don’t cry. Didn’t I teach you from the time you were a little boy that Hashem, the God of Israel is the one and only God. That He created the seas and the rivers, the heavens and the earth? Remember that He made everything according to His will, and He conducts everything in the world according to His will. There is nothing, <i>nothing</i> hidden from Him, even in the depths of the earth, even deep under the waters of the sea. He made everything, sees everything, and watches everything. We and all of God’s creatures eventually come to and end, but God Himself is living and enduring, for He is the Eternal One, He is measureless. And because God is Eternal and his Greatness is measureless, we can’t see of Him. He is so great that none of His creations can conceive of Him. Look, my dear son. Think about this. Everyone knows that things that children can know, things that children can do, are small things suited for a child’s mind and level of wisdom. And with a grown man, even thought he knows so much more than a child, still, his wisdom is also very limited, for a man can only know so much. But our God is so great, so exalted and high, that all the wisdom of the world, including the angels, cannot understand His wisdom. This is God’s greatness. And all of His actions on high, together with His actions on earth are not known, and this is God’s splendor. Look, my sweetest, look. Doesn’t the Almighty, the God of Israel fill the whole world, and there is place, not even the smallest corner, that He doesn’t fill? Even right now, during this very conversation that we are having, God is right before us, He is here, so how is it that we don’t see Him? After all, isn’t the Holy One of Israel within you and within me? Why don’t we know Him? Remember how I told you that man’s wisdom is so limited – could a man with his mortal wisdom understand this? So what we have to do is to believe in Him, many He be blessed. We need to follow God’s path without fancy questions or dilemmas. We believe, and follow His laws and judgments just as Avraham Avinu commanded his son Yitschak, and Yitschak to Yaakov, and Yaakov to his sons, and his sons to their sons after them, right down to us!”
“You are so fortunate to be a son of Israel, among the sons of God! Be happy that you have the great merit of serving Him, and even thought you have seen the cruelty with which they treat the children of Israel, how they shame us and make our lives so bitter. Put away your doubts, and don’t confuse yourself by wondering why God does not show mercy upon us, why the King of the entire land would abandon his children, the children of Israel to be rejected and shamed, and why he doesn’t destroy the cruel oppressors in an instant. Does He lack thunder in Heaven? Can’t He join together all of the lightning in the skies, strike them and reduce them to ashes? Don’t disturb your faith by questioning the correctness of God’s ways. He is the Holy One, blessed be He. He is the most merciful, and He can do anything according to His will. What could be difficult for Him? Who could stop Him? He is Infinite, He is measureless. His mercy and His abilities are also without measure. And all of your questions are according to your knowledge, and your knowledge does not understand why God had not yet shown His mercy. And as I said, your knowledge and our knowledge is just human, so greatly limited, but God’s knowledge is infinite. Part of God’s greatness is that it is impossible for us to understand His knowledge. So at the time when you see all of our suffering and humiliation, bow your head before God, and say, “God is righteous in all of His ways, and kind in all of His actions.” Just pour your heart out before Him and ask for Him to be merciful with us. And see, please, see, my sweetest one. It has been almost two hundred and ten years that we have been stuck in Egypt, and the Egyptians have already rejoiced over us, saying that the Jews have lost all hope and will forever remain slaves. They say that we will expire under their rod. But God sits in Heaven and laughs at the nations! Now that He is willing, He has sent us His prophets, Moshe and Aharon, the sons of Amram, to redeem us from slavery to freedom, from oppression to redemption, from darkness to a great light.”
“We are not only being redeemed from the whip of Egypt, not only from beneath the axe of the wicked, but we are leaving behind their spiritual sickness. We are leaving the garbage-heap of their evils. We are going away from their bad behavior, from the impurity of their souls and bodies, more loathsome than mice and snakes they are. We are now going to shake off any hint of the Egyptians and their ways and their impurities, and be cleansed. And furthermore, God has promised us that He will come down from the highest heavens and give us the Torah. All of the worlds were only created for the sake of the Holy Torah, and He is giving it to us! Though it we will all become sanctified. After all, aren’t we His children, the children of Hashem? So it is impossible for each person to act according to his human desires and understanding. Rather each person needs to act – to speak, think, and even desire - according to how God wills and understands, for God is holy, and we are going to be a holy nation.”
The announcement of the coming redemption had a wondrous effect on the children of the Jewish nation. They were no longer terror-stricken children whose eyes broadcasted fear and bewilderment, no longer milling about dumbfounded as if abandoned by their loved ones, with arms paralyzed from hopelessness, with nerves frayed to the point where they would feel pangs of terror at the rustling of a leaf. They became living children. Upon hearing the news, each one ran to his friend’s house, and the friend to his friend. Quickly they gathered in their homes and in the marketplaces, telling each other what their father’s had told them. Some of the children’s voices rang above the voices of their friends as they said, “yes, the God of Israel will come to us, and I will be the first to know it!<sup class="footnote-marker">139</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos Rabbah, Parsha 1.</i> I remember how I was once alone in the desert, and an angel of God gave me food and drink!” And then they would run home and ask their parents, “Abba, Imma, when will we be taken out of Egypt? When will God come to us with His Torah? Why didn’t He come today? I want to be a son to God! All that He will command me, <i>all</i> that he will command me I will do!”
And his father and mother will answer him, “Son, didn’t we tell you that we don’t know anything? We are not in control, only God is in control, and must act according to His will. That means that whenever He wills it, it will happen. We have only to wait and pray to Him. But if you yearn so strongly for the redemption and for His Torah, then you have to prepare yourselves and act in a way that God will find you worthy of His salvation and His Torah.” Then with one voice, the father, mother, the sons, and the daughters, all accepted upon themselves from that moment onward to conduct themselves in the best manner possible so as to prepare themselves for the awaited day.
Pharaoh continued to do evil to Israel and embitter their lives. Again he made a harsh decree against them, “don’t give them straw,” and again the Jews felt the bitter taste of oppression. Though they were already beaten, the sadistic one became even crueler and beat them even stronger. In this way they did not even know that the redemption had already started. Again God sent great plagues upon Pharaoh. This caused the children of Israel to believe in God and yearned for Him even stronger, coming ever closer to Him. Then came the night-vigil – the first night of the Egyptian Passover. Though they were yet in Egypt they were no longer slaves and no longer broken in spirit. They ate their Paschal lambs, shoes on their feet and staves in their hands, ready for redemption. They were already saying Hallel<sup class="footnote-marker">140</sup><i class="footnote">Gemara and Shemos Rabba, Parsha 18.</i> - songs and praises to the One who had already done all of these miracles. These songs were a testament to their great faith. Song poured out of every window of every Jewish home, singing, “Give thanks to God, for He is good, for His mercy endures forever.” And suddenly, a lone, bitter voice cried out from beneath the windows of Israel, “who here is Moshe, who here is Aharon? Come out, come out!” At first the children were frightened by this, and with trembling voices asked their parents, “Abba, Imma, has the evil taskmaster come again to call us to work? Didn’t our master Moshe and his brother Aharon already promise us that on this night we are to be redeemed?”
“Children, do not fear, don’t be frightened,” the parents answered their children. “It is not the taskmaster calling. It is only Pharaoh and his ministers.<sup class="footnote-marker">141</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> It used to be that the whole land trembled before them, and with a wink of an eye they would shed rivers of Jewish blood. But now these very same people are suffering so severely that they are running wildly among the Israelites, going from door to door to find Moshe and Aharon, to ask them and all of us to have mercy on them and leave Egypt without delay. Look, my children, look at God’s mighty acts!” The children could no longer hold back. They jumped from their places to dance and sing with their pure voices, their parents helping them by clapping their hands, “Blessed is He and blessed is His name! There is none like You, Hashem, and nothing like your works! How shall we praise you, O praiseworthy King, and how shall we bless You, exalted above all blessing and praise!” Everyone in the house was already dancing, and the celebration grew from house to house, from tribe to tribe, until all of Israel was singing and dancing together. Elsewhere, the land of Egypt was burning with death and loss, and there in the land of Goshen there was light and salvation, joy and song in praise of God<sup class="footnote-marker">142</sup><i class="footnote">Pirkei D’Rebbi Eliezar.</i> On high the angels rejoiced together with them, saying, “Blessed is the God of Israel!” And the Holy One, blessed be He, rejoiced together with them. Amid such song did the children of Israel leave Egypt. They didn’t walk out of Egypt – they danced their way out. They danced, with Hashem the God of the heavens and the earth, the God of Israel going before them in a pillar of cloud and fire, with Moshe Rabeynu, Aharon HaCohen, and the elders of the tribes together with them, singing the words of the Hallel, “Praise Him, servants of God and not servants of Pharaoh! Give thanks to God for He is good!” The sounds they made shook the heavens and the earth, and it seemed as if the dome of the firmament was lifted by their voices. At this time, the other nations of the world asked, “Who is this coming out of the desert, uniting herself with her beloved?”<sup class="footnote-marker">143</sup><i class="footnote">Shir HaSHirim, 8:5.</i> Who is this multitude dancing so, their fiery faces turned heavenwards, and whose whole being ascends in the flames of their song? They are Godly beings!<sup class="footnote-marker">144</sup><i class="footnote">Shir HaShirim Rabbah, Parsha 3.</i> It must be the songs of the angels of heaven singing out to God, and now they have descended to the land!”
No, they are not angels of heaven. They are the seraphim of God who dwell in the land, the children of Israel, the children of God. It is just that when their troubles increased in the land of Egypt, their forms blackened from travail, then even there name of their Father and King, even their names and essence was covered and hidden. But now that God has saved them, both His name and the names of his children, the children of Israel, have now appeared. Now all of the people of the earth shall know that Hashem is our God, Hashem is One. And who is like Israel, One nation in the land.
Now I only hope to God, young man and Avreich, that now that you have looked into thoughts such as these, that you will see their great benefit. If before you were doubtful, saying, “what use is this for us,” you no longer feel this way, because surely they caused you to feel. Now all of your mundane feelings have been swept out of your soul. The place that they once occupied are now filled with holy feelings and yearning for God. What more could we ask for?

Chapter 8

<big><strong>Another Journey in the Holy Imagination. (Another Example and Way of Expanded Thought)</strong></big>
Since the expansion of thought provided in the previous example including both intense thought and intensity of feeling has lifted you, there is something else that you must understand. It is not only uplifting thoughts of a soulful nature – the exodus from Egypt, the giving of the Torah, and so forth – that will build and expand the length, height, and depth of your brain and heart. Your brain and heart will also be built and expanded by thoughts which subdue man’s spirit, crushing the (evil) inclination within him. Young man, Avreich Chassid, think about how fortunate you would feel if you only had the ability to subdue your spirit at a time when your evil inclination begins to stir up its brouhaha, enticing you with desires so sweet that you feel unable to break their charm? If only your whole being and will could break at this time, your inclination and your lust destroyed together with them. Then you would be a Tsaddik, finally being the master of your heart and your being. Truly, why don’t you currently have such a power? Why can’t you destroy in a split second these evil spirits which storm within you, seeking to cause you to lose this world and the next, God forbid? Didn’t I provide you with the words of my holy ancestor which instruct a man as to how to wake up simple fear within him, where one would think that at least the fear of God’s punishment would work to curb his behavior, as even a simple animal avoids pain? But everything depends on the quality of your expansion of thought.
Our sages taught us an even more potent means in the battle against destructive desires, namely, that one should contemplate the day of his death. This is not the kind of fear that one has in order to avoid punishment, but rather remembering something more difficult than any punishment on earth, something that no man can escape. We find in the Gemara (Berachos, 5), “one should always incite his good inclination to rage over his inclination to evil … if he is successful, well, and if not, he should study Torah … and if not, he should recite the <i>Shema</i> … and if not, he should contemplate the day of his death.” The Gemara is telling us that the last resort, that of contemplating the day of his death, is the surest way to subdue one’s own evil nature. One who does this will indeed save himself, but not if he does it in a way that it is no more than a brief and passing thought. Try to expand this thought even at a time when your <i>yetser ha’rah</i> is not pursuing you. Expand it until you are thoroughly sensitized by it. If indeed deep feelings of <i>hisragshus</i> passed through you while you developed your expanded thought, then at a time when your <i>yetser ha’rah</i> actually does incite you, God forbid, then you will only need to remind yourself of the day of your death for the advice of the sages to have a strong deterrent effect upon you. The effect will be even stronger if you continue to intensify your thoughts and feelings while under attack. You will successfully break your self-destructive spirit together with your evil inclination, while simultaneously strengthening your true inner being and your <i>kedushah</i>.
This thought will be expanded both according to ways mentioned in holy sefarim as well as according to results gained from actual experience. May God protect us from all evil, and lengthen the days and years of all of Israel in general and in particular. Remember – we are not about to describe to you something that happened thousands of years ago like the Exodus from Egypt. Nor are we going to describe something that happens only to some people, but other people are saved from it, and as such we could hope to be among the lucky souls who are spared. The Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">145</sup><i class="footnote">Berachos, 17a.</i> has already said, “the end of man is death, the end of beast is slaughter, everything stands to die,” and no one can escape it. After contemplating this, he will himself find himself unable to understand not only how he could be enticed by his evil inclination into indulging his various lusts, but he will not even understand how he could take necessary things and use them to fulfill his desires, since he is now more certain that he will die (unless the resurrection comes in his days) that he is certain that the sun is shining before him. He shall remind himself of the day of his death, and how dreadful that day is. Even the days preceding his final day are enough to make him tremble and banish the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> from its allures. And how much more so all that awaits him after that dreadful day.
He has become ill several times, but always after a few days he recovered, thank God. But now the illness seems to linger on day after day, and it is difficult to be rid of it. “It is really not such a serious illness,” he reassures himself, indeed, deceives himself, but deep down he feels as if he is stuck in a swamp, and no sooner has he freed one leg from the mud that the other leg is thoroughly stuck. Two days ago he felt better (even the doctor said he was getting better) and he was sure that by today he would be getting out of bed. But today the pains returned and were worse than ever before. For the past two nights he could hardly sleep from the pain, turning his house upside down so that day was not day and night was not night. His family was sleeping in the day after being up with him all night. This one could hardly drag his feet after standing by him all night, rubbing the place where his pain would hurt him, turning him from this side to the other. His heart already knew the bitterness of his soul, for deep inside he could feel that the end was near and he was thoroughly frightened by this feeling. Didn’t he know that he would not live forever? But now that his heart told him that the end was coming and he would soon be going, his whole body writhed from the realization. There is a great difference between knowing of the eventuality of death and actually dying. Even now he tries to assuage his fears and subdue his morose thoughts, even banish them completely, telling himself, “I’m just nervous.” But his situation is going from bad to worse, and his pains are increasing to the point where they are nearly impossible to bear.
He had suffered in the past. But he always seemed to understand the nature of his suffering, for even pain and suffering is something that needs to be understood and measured in the mind, “this is painful but not as painful as that,” and the like. But now, he can’t seem to grasp and his mind can’t seem to fathom it. He didn’t know such pains existed in the world, and he just can’t seem to take it. After a particularly bad night he feels as if the pain has separated his bones and cut his limbs into pieces. Death and the grave wear the body away into dust, and now in his life he is actually feeling the beginning of this process. It seems as if heaven is sending the weapon of destruction to begin separating his body and wearing it away, and the grave will finish the job.
His sons, daughters, and his wife all console him, “its nothing, you will soon be better. You’ll soon be getting out of bed.” This only causes him greater dismay. He thinks, “how happy I would be if it were only so! Oy, how good and sweet it would be! If I could only hope to be together with you, it would be my greatest joy, my sweet ones. But the days are coming closer when I will finally be torn away from you and lowered into the grave. The worms will be my friends. The worms and I will enjoy endless days together, celebrating Shabbos and Holidays together only with them. Yes, the soul goes up to heaven, but isn’t the body also worth something? A person’s body is worth something to him, after all, he work most of his years for it. Even the Torah esteems the value of the body according to the mitzvos that it fulfills. Of the resurrection of the dead, the Zohar tells us that it is this very body that we have in this world that will be resurrected.<sup class="footnote-marker">146</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar, Parshas Chayei Sarah, 130b, 131a.</i> And now, how will my body remain? In a dark pit and in moist earth.” He contemplates his hand, “what will become of this? Rotten flesh, a few bones, and no more.” And furthermore, he thinks about his wife and children. What kind of a state will they be in after he dies? Their sorrow breaks his heart, and he cries over them.
His friends come to visit him, and they calm him down. They bless him with wellbeing, and offer encouraging words. It could be that the first few times he finds strength in their words, but during the course of his illness when his pain is greater and his dark musings disturb him, and he thinks, “It would be so pleasant if I could be together with you, my friends. How bitter it is that I lie here isolated, separated from you, alone in a dark pit. It would be such a holy joy to be with you, all together, hearing the music you play and the songs you sing to God. What a nightmare it is to be lying here, listening to the jiggering of the bugs and the rustling the vermin under and around my bed. If only I knew, my sons. If only I had hope, my friends, that at least on Shabbos and Holidays I could allow my soul to fly to you and join in you pure celebrations, then I would already be happy. Then I would wrap myself in your Torah teachings and in your prayers, I would hold on to your belts, and dance with you in the circle dance of the Chassidim, and in this way ascend in Hashem’s own simchah that is among you. But who knows if I will be worthy of this. Who knows if, regardless of my current state, I will be granted permission to at least watch your simchah from afar, to watch you, and to see the splendor of your holy joy at these times. Who knows! Who knows! Would that at least you would remember me as I want to remember you - as much as I will be allowed to remember you. But what do we know! Maybe even this will not be possible, because, “there is no remembrance of former things.”<sup class="footnote-marker">147</sup><i class="footnote">Koheles, Ch. 1:11, meaning, I will be forgotten and my memory tossed in the dustbin of history.</i> How hard it is to leave you. How difficult it is to tear myself away from you.
He takes account of his life.<sup class="footnote-marker">148</sup><i class="footnote">Cheshbon Nefesh. See below, in chapter thirteen. The Cheshbon Nefesh is moral accounting, reckoning, or soul-searching, whose task is to evaluate whether or not his thoughts, words, and deeds were moral, and if they were not, honestly admitting this to himself and to God, and accepting the responsibility for the results of his choices and behavior.</i> He thinks, “What will He do with my soul in the world to come?” In his younger, stronger days, when his <i>yester ha’rah</i> would entice him, he would also make such accounts and evaluate whether or not his behavior was moral. Then, if he would remember something he did that was improper, he would glaze over it, rationalize it or reinterpret it in a way that it did not seem so bad, and in this way avoid being ashamed of himself. But it is not this way now. Now he is so close to death, and at such a time he has neither a <i>yetser ha’rah</i> nor wayward desire. Now he is completely honest in reckoning his actions. He sees the sins and the blemishes. All told, he whiled away his life in the pursuit of vanity and nonsense. Either he indulged his desires with eating, drinking or similar pleasures, or he worked like a dog in order to earn money spent on the fulfillment of these desires, or just for the sake of being wealthy, or just for the sake of gaining honor. And even if he would learn, pray, or do mitzvos - more or less - and other people who saw him doing these holy actions were under the impression that they were earnest, it was really only he alone who knew. He knows his thoughts and intentions, and he alone knows if the motivation for his actions were pure and for the sake of heaven, or if they were only in order to make himself look admirable to others. Nonetheless, it could be that throughout his whole life, only a small portion of his Torah study and <i>avodas Hashem</i> was actually for the sake of heaven, and thus pure in intention. It is fair to say that when he learned Torah, he truly directed his mind to understanding what was being said, but of his prayers, “<i>shomu Shamayim</i>!” Let the heavenly court make a reckoning and see how many times he mumbled his prayers even unaware of what was coming out of his mouth. And now, going up before God and the heavenly court, he and we would like to know what kind of expression will be on his face when he stands before the King! Everything is know and revealed before God. And this man knows that so many times he stood before God, speaking directly to the Almighty, while all the while his thoughts where screening foolishness and vanity cruder than his fellow’s. Has he improved his behavior? Has he tackled his <i>lashon ha’rah</i>, his jealousy, lusts, his desires for honor?
What has he done with himself and with the years he was given on earth? What has he done to the sum total of his being and the state of his soul in all of his experiences of delight and joy all the days of his life? Now nothing remains for him aside from feelings of despising the damage and loathing the one who made the decisions. Sometimes it happens that he is quite conscious of his behavior, and he sees himself in his mind’s eye involved in one of the ways in which he would derive pleasure. He sees himself steeped in and consumed by the desire until it has taken over his very being. And in this worldly, physical vision, he does not see himself. He does not see the world. He sees but only the desire. And if there is any time that he remembers that there is a Master of the world who is scrutinizing him, it is at that time.
How bitter are the pangs of death! How difficult it is to suffer them when one is steeped in feelings of scorn and loathing for one’s entire life’s conduct! He wants to curse the very day he was born into the horrible and painful life that is his own.
What has he done with the years of his life? He now asks himself, “what could I have done with my years?” How fortunate he would be if he had led every day of his life according to the Torah, in purity and piety. At the very least he would have learned to conduct himself in the proper way. That is to say, at the very least he would have eaten, drank, even conducted his business, with the express intention that it was all only in order to allow him to serve God. Even if he did not reach the level where all of his actions were completely dedicated to the service of God, at least he would have kept that goal in mind. If he could do it again, at the very least he would keep the consciousness of this yearning for closeness to God, His <i>kedushah</i>, and His Torah before him at all times. If only he could go back in time, he would always look deep inside himself, and see clearly every defect of his character, every blemish of his soul, and work with all of his strength to fix them and become whole. And even though it is a nearly impossible task to fix everything that has been mentioned, and no one, not even the greatest Tsaddik can stand before the heavenly court in total innocence,<sup class="footnote-marker">149</sup><i class="footnote">Koheles, (7:20), “for there is no righteous man in the land who shall do (only) good and not sin.”</i> still, he would have known that he would be punished in Gehinom for those infractions, and after paying his debt, the Blessed One would return to him and bind his soul in the source of Life. Yet now surely he would not be so fortunate. Even if he had something in his defense that could aid in his acquittal on high, still, since he feels his own guilt and negligence so strongly, how could he even think about being released from doing hard time in hell? He shudders at the thought.
Who knows what will be done with him, and who knows whether or not God will cast him away from before the Divine presence? What can he do? He wants to tear his very flesh from his bones, but it seems that there is no advice in the world that he could follow in order to get out of this mess. He sits and cries, thoroughly regretting his ways. And yet, he is actually ashamed to “do Teshuvah,” because the main point of Teshuvah is refraining from acting upon, if not eradicating, one’s destructive desires. Admitting one’s wrongs, even temporarily refraining from sin, and then falling off the wagon and sinning again is not true Teshuvah.<sup class="footnote-marker">150</sup><i class="footnote">Complete Teshuvah means a real change for the better that lasts one’s whole life. For example, if he is hot tempered and is easily incited to barking at others, complete Teshuvah would mean not only admitting before God that his angry outbursts are wrong and refraining from virtrolic verbal diarrhea, but actually never doing it again until his last living breath.</i> So if he still has the inclination, the only way to do complete Teshuvah would be if he had time to live, and in the span of that time, refrain from sinning.
Sooner or later he has a heart attack, and his house is thrown in a tummult. Doctors are summoned and he is administered endless muscular and intravenous injections. He is still acutely aware of the great sadness felt by his family members. His wife cries that she has nothing left to live for. His son prays with tears in his eyes, “Ribono Shel Olam, Master of all the Worlds! As long as his heart still beats, be merciful and give me the greatest gift of all. Give us back my dear father, for he is more precious to us than life itself!” Several times a day his daughters burst into sobbing as if they are about to break into pieces. He lays there like a stone as the doctor raises his arm and the attendant raises his leg. As far as he is concerned, it is as if he is no longer in possession of an arm or a leg. His heart contracts and offers feeble beats as if the angel of death were sitting on it, pushing it towards the grave where he will do with him … whatever it is that he does. The man lets out heavy, nasal moans, his heart and lungs pushed to their maximum strength just in order to keep him alive. You would think that this kind groan would be the sound of someone chopping down trees! Then he feels a little better, and quickly he offers his family a little joy with this information signaled through a painful smile. But still, there is neither wisdom, nor advice, nor understanding<sup class="footnote-marker">151</sup><i class="footnote">Kohelles, 9:10. In Sheol (“the void,” or “hell”), what you have done while alive is done. You cannot use your clever wisdom to escape Divine judgment or punnishement. (See Rashi) The point is to follow the path of devotion to God’s law while you are alive, at least to avoid punishment in the world to come. Torah behavior modification based on the fear of punishment in the afterworld is an intermediate level of <i>yiras Hashem</i>. See Tikkunei Zohar, 5b and the beginning of the Introduction to the Beis Yaakov by Rav Gershon Chanoch of Radzin, (Trans. B. Edwards)</i> with these ways of Hashem Tsevakos, the Lord of Hosts. We all do whatever we can with medical treatments, but when the time comes, a man must expire.
Come and see the words of the holy Zohar, describing the lot of man in such a wretched condition. This is what it says:<sup class="footnote-marker">152</sup><i class="footnote">Zohar, Parshas Nasso, 126b.</i> At a time when a man is about to die, the King’s messenger<sup class="footnote-marker">153</sup><i class="footnote">The angel of death.</i> comes down from heaven and stands at his feet, a sharp sword brandished in his hand. The man raises his eyes and sees a fire burning round the walls of his house. He then sees the angel, his head an orb of a million eyes, his garment an inferno of fire burning before him. Three bitter drops hang from his sword.<sup class="footnote-marker">154</sup><i class="footnote">These three drops are explained in the Zohar, Parshas Pekudei, 267a. The first is a bitter drop, like gall, which drops into the expiring man’s mouth and descends to his intestines. It has the spiritual effect of making bitter all the sweet tastes of sin that the man tasted in his lifetime, perhaps in order to allow him to know the error of his ways. The second drop causes his soul to go out, killing the man, and the third drop turns his skin green.</i> When the man sees him, his body and soul are overturned in shock. His heart is also filled with dread, much as the leader of a country facing destruction. His spirit spreads throughout the limbs of his entire body, taking leave of every limb, like a man who goes and says goodbye to his friend before leaving on a journey. Then the man cries out, “Oy, what have I done!?” But his Teshuvah is of no avail now. If only he had “prepared the remedy before the illness,”<sup class="footnote-marker">155</sup><i class="footnote">See Yeshaya 19:22, and 65:24, “before you call out I will answer you.” In Bereshit, “and the spirit of God was hovering above the waters,” is understood by Chassidus as the source of teshuvah and healing that prepared the way for, “let there be light,” the healing itself. The Midrash tells us, “before God created the world, He created Teshuvah.”</i> and mended his ways in the past, then he might have lived longer and not have been summoned to the afterworld at this time. The man is terrified, closes his eyes tight, and wishes that he could hide himself. But he can’t. Knowing that there is no alternative, he opens his eyes and is forced to look at the terrible reality facing him. In this way he gives over his body and soul. This is the supreme moment of man’s judgment in this world. In this way, his spirit travels throughout all the limbs of his body, taking leave of them, sailing through all of his sinews, causing an upheaval in every muscle, vein, nerve, and bone. When his spirit reaches each limb, saying goodbye, it sweats and the spirit departs from it. The limb dies at once, and so the spirit makes its rounds, one by one. When the spirit is ready to make its final exit from the body, the Shechinah then stands upon him, and the spirit departs from his body at once. Fortunate is the man who acted in a way as to invite the Shechinah to cleave to him in his lifetime, and woe to the wicked who pushed it away. How many courts of law in heaven must man pass through when he leaves the world?<sup class="footnote-marker">156</sup><i class="footnote">In the picturesque language of the Zohar, it says that the courts of the afterworld pass through man.</i> In one session is held when the soul leaves the body. In one session, the court reviews before him all of his words and actions. A court holds session when he descends into the grave. A court holds session while he is in the grave. One session takes place when the worms eat his corpse. One session takes place in Gehinom. And one session takes place when his spirit roams the earth and does not find its place until he has completed his actions. All in all, he is judged seven times. Therefore, it is crucial for man to fear his Master, reforming and refining his actions each and every day his still has in this world.
There are times when you heart is so heavy and your spirit is so carried away with the fire of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> that it is indeed extremely difficult to envision all that has been written about the day of one’s demise in order to break its hold. Sometimes a man does not want to think about himself and envision unpleasant matters. He only wants to think about what is enjoyable and comforting. He hides his eyes from the disturbing consequences of his actions, even if it is a foregone conclusion that given time such consequences will catch up with him. Please, look into yourself. Even after a good, simple, tasty lunch, you most likely can only think of pleasing things, but not anything difficult that would upset your spirit. I already told you, my dear Avreich, don’t be ashamed to admit things to me, for after all, I cannot see you. Look and you will see that these dead globs of food that you bite and chew with the greatest of desire can have the power to rule over your wisdom, your thoughts, and even your <i>avodas Hashem</i>.
But don’t worry. We hope that God will help us, members of the low generation, on the heels of the Messiah and the end of generations,<sup class="footnote-marker">157</sup><i class="footnote">The Talmud tells us that the history of the world until the final redemption will last six thousand years. If not the end of all generations, our generation, as was the author’s in 5704, is one of the last.</i> to control ourselves and come closer to Him, may He be blessed. At such times when are heavy of heart, you can nonetheless conjure up the image of a close relative or friend who passed away, and think about what it was like when you were together. Think about how you talked together, laughed together, and enjoyed each other’s company. Now think about what he looks like in the grave. Black, flesh torn, bones exposed … You are sitting comfortably at home, standing and speaking according to your wants and needs, and still your spirit overtakes you to indulge yourself, while your relative or friend lies in a narrow grave surrounded by the wet earth, where worms nested in his mouth or throat, for, “man’s expectations are worms.”<sup class="footnote-marker">158</sup><i class="footnote">Pirkei Avos, 4:4.</i>
But please be aware, young man, young Avreich Chassid, that we did not come here to depress you, God forbid. Our purpose is not to depress you, but to the contrary, it is to help you to guard yourself from becoming depressed. We have already quoted many holy <i>sefarim</i> that tell us how sadness is very far from the service of God. It pushes people away from the ability to serve and connect to <i>kedushah</i>. When the Gemara tells us, “remember the day of your death,” its only intention is to crush the spirit of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> and call the <i>yetser tov</i>, the good inclination, to fight fiercely for dominance and victory, but certainly not in order to make you depressed.
A man needs to know and know well that man’s intellect and its mechanics have no real existence in the world. If we took into detailed account all of the ways of the world and man, or in other words, if in our view of the “big picture” of life, which is a distillation of essential conclusions based on a reckoning of the of all the actions of man in the world and the workings of man’s mind and heart that engenders these actions,<sup class="footnote-marker">159</sup><i class="footnote">The original is more succinct, אם נמצה את תהלוכות העולם ואת האיש, which in a crude translation could read, “if you squeeze out all the ways of the world and man to their very essence.” This root finds other cognates in such words as, “mitsui,” squeezing out, “mitz,” juice, or “tamtsit,” essence. It is used in the Mussaf service on Rosh Hashannah in the prayer, “אם תמצה את עומק הדין, מי יצדק לפניך בדין, קדוש” which the Artscroll translation of the Machzor renders, “If You (God) wring out judgment to its essence (scrutinizing carefully and impartially all our deeds and intentions), who can survive before You in judgment, O Holy One!”</i> we would see that really there is no need for him to be happy at times when he is joyous, and there is no need to be sad when he feels sadness. There is really no reason to desire that which he desires, and no reason to despise that which he despises.<sup class="footnote-marker">160</sup><i class="footnote">Feelings of joy or sadness, love and hate, are based on nervous impulses set of by external stimuli.</i> We simply do not have the knowledge needed in order to truly understand that which we think we understand, and at the heights of understanding we simply admit that we do not know. This is hinted at in the verse (Tehilim, 92), “a brutish man cannot know, nor can a fool understand this.” That is to say, only a dullards and fools think that they possess the knowledge to truly know and understand. Therefore they are baffled when they come upon something that they do not know or understand. They think, “this defies logic,” and they open their mouths and tell you how difficult it is for them when it beyond the grasp of their intellect. But for someone who is neither a dullard nor a fool knows that the human intellect is not capable of understanding whether everything is truly logical or illogical, from the simple fact that there are many things that the mind is incapable of grasping. But for one, God is the unique being, and His will it truly unique, and God’s knowledge is also truly unique.<sup class="footnote-marker">161</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning that there is no unity in the world like God’s unity, nor any will or knowledge in the world that can be like God’s will or knowledge. He is truly and supremely unique. Mishne Torah, Deot, 1:1</i> When God wills something and adjudicates it in the world, man understands that it is good, and that which God does not desire and duly adjudicates that it is not to be, man understands that it is not good. When God willed it and decreed that the inhabitants of the earth will see the sun rising in the east and traveling across the sky to its setting in the west, we all understand that this is how it has to be. If it were not to follow this course, it would defy human logic. If God decided that the sun would not move, or that we would see it moving from the west to the east, then humans would find it normal and logical that the sun does not move, or moves to the east.<sup class="footnote-marker">162</sup><i class="footnote">For a development of this idea, see Part Two of Rav Gershon Chenoch of Radzin, Zts”l’s Introduction to the Beis Yaakov.</i>
Even the very will to live which God placed in living creatures, seemingly so fundamental according to the human intellect, is really not based on intellect. Why do animals instinctively fear a looming or even distant danger, where in their minds and in the animal equivalent of the intellect they do not even know that it is something dangerous? They sense the danger, even if it is a predator the likes of which they have never actually encountered or even learned about from their parents. It is all a divinely programmed law of nature, and follows that great law of nature that God willed where every living being has the will to live and survive. We understand with our intellects that indeed in order to live, every living being must necessarily have the will to live, but in order to explain it, in the final analysis, we must say that it is a law adjudicated by God or if you will, an instinct of survival programmed into living beings by the Creator. It is according to Divine legislation that man loves and rejoices, and when He does not legislate as such, man despises and is saddened. We came into the world not of our own accord, but against our will.<sup class="footnote-marker">163</sup><i class="footnote">Pirkei <i>Avot</i>, Chapter 4, Mishnah 22.</i> Man is born according to God’s will and decree. And after the length of his years, His will and decree shows man the door. This world belongs to God. The upper worlds and the lower worlds are all His, and always, in whichever world man exists, he is there by virtue of Divine permission, protected beneath the wings of the <i>Shechinah</i>.
Since all of out desires, thoughts, joys, and inclinations come from God, therefore all of these are only true for one who walks in God’s path and in the ways of His Torah. And if a man, Heaven forbid, distances himself from God and the His Torah, then all of his desires and thoughts, joys and inclinations, are a fiction, a lie, meaningless, and dead. All of our lives and the length of our days we need to rejoice in God and in His Torah, simply because God legislated his laws into our very lives, carving them into our very DNA. And how much more will rejoice in all of our <i>Avodas Hashem</i> when we know at the deepest level that God chose us to be His sons and His servants, to live a life hallowed by His commandments and His Torah! What is our <i>simchah</i>, and what is the <i>simchah</i> of Israel in the world at large? It is as we find written in the verse (Yeshayahu, 61), “I will surely rejoice in Hashem, and my soul will be gladdened in my God.” Our joy is in God, may He be blessed, and His Torah is our <i>simchah</i> and our delight.

Chapter 9

<big><strong>The Tactics of Hisragshus: Maintaining Holy Sensitivity and Avoiding Problematic Feelings.</strong></big>
Chassidus is a difficult path in the service of God. From its inception, its proponents and Masters advised those who seek to follow the path of Chassidus to develop inner tactics in order to strengthen and refine their <i>Avodas Hashem</i>. In Chapter Five, in introducing such tactics, we presented the advice of the Holy Baal Shem Tov (Rav Yisrael ben Eliezar) and the Maor VaShemesh (Rav Kalonymus Kalman Epstein), yet truly, almost all of the writings of the Chassidic Masters discuss this matter. Here too, we are not presumptuous, and we will not claim that we can ascend to their heights or rise to the level of the sublime and holy tactics that they employed. Yet as beginners, we can only start if we understand the following fundamental principle.<sup class="footnote-marker">164</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, this is necessary in order for each person to begin to develop his own holy <i>avodah</i> according to his own individual level.</i> We need to know that the point of these tactics is for man to sanctify himself to the point where his very body is transformed into <i>neshama</i>. That is to say, all of his physical activity<sup class="footnote-marker">165</sup><i class="footnote">His eating, drinking, sleeping, marital relations, and even business and travel activity, are all not only done according to the laws of the Torah, but he does all of these with the consciousness that they are done before the Divine presence and are indeed activities whose purpose is to magnify the glory of God in the world.</i> is sanctified to the extent where it is not only as holy as the <i>neshama</i>, but even to the extent where body and <i>neshama</i> become a unified entity with a single common purpose. The body is transformed into the <i>neshama</i>, and as such, the only path before man is the path of the <i>neshama</i> and none other. This is not so for people who are greatly attached to the body and physical activities for their own sake. When man’s will is attached to the physical, or, if you will, taking orders from the different appetites of the body, he will be drawn in different directions. Clearly this is because different organs and limbs of the body have different natures and different concerns, different functions and different agendas. And because this is so, the Torah has provided us with different forms of <i>avodah</i>. Yet when a person’s <i>avodah</i> is only concerned with doing something, even just to saying something or thinking something, then the order becomes the be all and the end all, while the purpose of the commandment is absent.<sup class="footnote-marker">166</sup><i class="footnote">It is preferable to serve God with joy. Rav Shlomo Carlebach Z’L used use the expression, “knocking off a mincha.” When a person, “knock’s off” a mitzvah, he does it automatically, quickly, and without feeling. (Yet still we often find that one can only sustain the deep feeling of, “<i>hiskashrus</i>” or connecting to God, if he davens quickly.) Anyone who has been to a wedding officiated by Reb Shlomo has seen a great example of the Chassidus taught in these pages. Whenever it is possible, serve God with joy, feeling, reverence, and take the time necessary to ascend to these middos.</i> Just say these words, profess this belief or have this intention in mind, and that’s all. This is not the path of Chassidus. The point of Chassidus is to sanctify man.<sup class="footnote-marker">167</sup><i class="footnote">Or to give man the opportunity to sanctify himself by virture of his own decisions and actions. The ways of man are divided into thought, speech, and action. Every commandment, every avodah stresses one of these modalities more than the others. For instance, you need to perform the action of walking in order to visit the sick or console a mourner. The empathy for a mourner and ability to console involves words (but by and large it is rare that once can find the words that could actually succeed in consoling), but maybe more so feelings and thoughts. A mitzvah like Tefillin is basically an action, bind the Tefillin and you have done the mitzvah, but it also involves words in the blessing one recites and thoughts in the intentions one has in performing the mitzvah. Prayer involves very little action (standing or sitting, jumping at kadosh kadosh, kadosh, or “shukling,” back and forth, if it helps to arouse ones emotions or intensify one’s concentration) but much more speech and thought. Yet in the above passage, the Rebbe is telling us that it is not enough just to act, speak, or think. Then we are little more that automatons, and have made the error of relating to God as a kind of marine drill sergeant. “When I say, ‘Jump,’ you say, How high, sir?’ ” You need to know why you are jumping, and jump with an innate sense of purpose. <br>HaRav Adin Steinsaltz (Even Yisrael) once explained the term “<i>Chiloni</i>” – what is normally understood in modern Hebrew as meaning a “secular Jew.” But what is a <i>chiloni</i>, really? A <i>chiloni</i> is a Jew who kisses the mezuzah when he leaves the house in the morning, goes to synagogue, puts on his Tefillin, and says every word of the prayer. Then when he comes home, he takes out his checklist, and makes a mark for everything he has done. “Kissed mezuzah (check), went to shul (check), put on tefillin (check).” His entire concern is fulfilling religious obligations. In other words, a real “<i>chiloni</i>” succeeded in taking the sacred and making it mundane, for indeed the root of the word “<i>chiloni</i>,” – “<i>chol</i>” – is a root which connotes commonplace, mundane, everyday activities, as opposed to “<i>kodesh</i>,” which means separate, possessing special sanctity, or dedicated to the spiritual. <br>Of course obedience is important. A main theme of this book is service, and service is invalidated by disobedience. Furthermore, law is ineffective without a community that adheres to it. But it must be understood that mechanical obedience is a real problem. One could be thoroughly obedient to every letter in the Code of Jewish law, and still not have fulfilled what God asks of us when He said in the Torah, “<i>Kedoshim Tihiu</i> – You shall be holy.”</i> Therefore, as long as man has not yet rid himself of his attachment to the materiality, or has even become “fed up” with the nature of the body and its divided agendas, then his <i>avodah</i> will take its cue from the divided wills of the body. His service will be inconsistent and pulled in different directions. It is almost impossible for man to truly sanctify himself if he does not contemplate deeply the different natures of different physical activities and invest his energies in refining them.
As was mentioned, this is the beginning and the foundation that we and our children need to know. The first thing we need to tackle is our physical lives and its nature. Once devoted to the struggle, we find that many of the difficulties in overcoming the body fly away with the wind. With bravery and perseverance in this mental struggle, man will find safe passage through the pitfalls of corporeality and eventually be released from its powers. I sincerely hope and pray that when we serve God in this way, you will not find a man among us who has not taken a meaningful portion in the <i>kedushah</i> of Chassidus, and will not be considered a Chassid according to his own level. Indeed, we began by saying that Chassidus is a difficult path, requiring tactics, spiritual methods and mental exercises in order to achieve its goal. But really, why is it so difficult? Why should it be so difficult for a Jewish person to make himself holy? Isn’t Israel the holy nation? Didn’t God say to us, “You are a holy nation unto Hashem your God?” True, you could say that it is because we have a difficult <i>yetser ha’rah</i> inciting us from within. But still, no matter how great the power of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> and the attraction of it’s allure, it pales in comparison to the measure of valor and strength possessed by man. Look carefully at the words of Rabbi Abba in the Midrash, where he tells us, “The <i>yetser ha’rah</i> is like a worn out bandit who sat at the crossroads. Though he was truly weak, he had the ability to put on a fearsome act, and was truly intimidating. When anyone passed by, the bandit needed only to cast a terrorizing gaze and say and say, “empty out your pockets,” and the incapacitated victim would obey. Then one day a clever man passed by and saw that the bandit was in fact feeble, and instead of fearing him and giving him his wallet, he began to give him a good thrashing. Similarly, the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> destroyed many generations - the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and the <i>Dor Haflagah</i> - the generation of the separation of man. But when Avraham stood and saw how the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> was no match for him, he began to thrash it.” The <i>yetser ha’rah</i> is really like an intimidating, but essentially weak old bandit. It manages to win on the strength of a, “psychological advantage.” Even though it is quite weak, it wins because people are afraid of it. Their fear leads them to believe that it is powerful. Yet an intelligent person, after seeing the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> for what it is, can readily crush it, and break its hold.
In light of this, it must be added that if teacher of Torah is giving a “<i>mussar shmooze</i>”<sup class="footnote-marker">168</sup><i class="footnote">A, “mussar shmooze” is a fiery Torah lecture of ethical instruction whose purpose is to enlighten the students to virtuous and devout behavior. A movement promoting behavior modification rooted in the advice of the great Rabbis throughout the ages was created by the Lithuanian Rabbi Israel Salanter (1810-1883).</i> to his students and impresses upon them that the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> is a mighty force or an awesome and overwhelming power, then he is making a serious mistake. Upon hearing the description of a terrifying warrior and his tremendous strength, it is natural for a person’s knees to weaken and his hands to go limp without having to contend with the adversary in the flesh. Then if he actually had to fight the warrior, it would be a foregone conclusion, not even from the strength of his opponent but from his own weakened state. So when they describe the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> as such a powerful and intimidating force, the students very bodies are weakened, melting before the very thought of contending with evil and temptation. Then the <i>yetser</i> truly gains a strength that it previously did not have. After such preparation, they would not at all be dismayed if they failed before it, God forbid. They would justify it, saying, “what do you expect!? The <i>yetser ha’rah</i> is so powerful, certainly much more powerful than I.” And then when they grow older, they don’t even put up a fight against the onslaughts of desire in its various forms. Stand strong, <i>Bachur</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">169</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Bachur</i> – young man.</i> <i>Avreich</i>, at the time the <i>yetser</i> incites you to some low behavior, stand your ground, and make the following ardent, valiant declaration. “Hear me well. I take orders only from the Torah, and not from my <i>yetser ha’rah</i>.” Upon doing so, it will become clear to you that much of the might of the <i>yester ha’rah</i> is fictional and fraudulent. It only seems powerful due to your own slackness, while your insecurity grants it the upper hand. But we know that it is not really so powerful, as we learned from the Midrash.
With this said we may now return to the matter of transforming the physical into the spiritual. The beginning of knowledge is that as long as our <i>kedushah</i> has not increased and our <i>neshama</i> is not revealed to the extent where our bodies and their powers are subservient to the <i>neshama</i>, meaning a constant subservience in the manner of the great Tsaddikim of ages hence, we are obliged to engage in profound contemplation of the powers of the body and the <i>nefesh</i>, taking them and their natural qualities and binding them to holy <i>avodah</i> until we are thoroughly sanctified. At the end of the tenth chapter of the book of Shemos (Exodus), Pharaoh tells Moshe that the Children of Israel can go into the desert and serve God, but they have to leave their animals behind. Moshe replies that they will even be taking animals from the Egyptians, “for we will be using them to serve God.” The Chassidic Masters interpret this to mean that the holy Jew takes his very animal soul and uses it to serve God and illuminate the world with goodness. The man of Israel is holy! His body is holy - and his animal soul is indeed holy, as it is rooted in the face of the ox on God’s chariot in the vision of Yechezkel. Yet the evil inclination hijacks the animal soul, using its holy powers for evil. We have only to return them to their rightful place, for they come from <i>kedushah</i> and they will be used for a holy purpose.
And concerning the practice of intensifying thought, imagination, and <i>hisragshus</i>, do you think we are asking you to pull a rabbit out of a hat? Are we expecting you to entertain a fantasy of being able to create feelings, thoughts, and abilities that you don’t already have within you and of which you are not actually capable? Everyone has thoughts, dreams, and feelings, even the occasional intense feeling of <i>hislahavus</i>. It is just that he uses them for everyday activities,<sup class="footnote-marker">170</sup><i class="footnote">People can feel intense emotions during a soccer game or while watching a movie, enough to make them jump from their seat in excitement or even cry.</i> and sometimes the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> seizes them and uses them for evil, God forbid. <i>Bachur</i>, <i>Avreich</i>! Do you really need to spend such tremendous energy and undergo such self-sacrifice in order to channel them into <i>kedushah</i>? Long after retirement, the businessman or the artisan can easily bring forth real thoughts and images of commerce or creativity, because the thoughts, imaginations, and hisragshus that they once felt are still easily accessed even decades after retirement. So how is it that you find it difficult to allow your soul to reveal holy thoughts, images, and <i>hisragshus</i>, when in fact its source and essence, even of the animal soul, is holy? If it is difficult it is only because the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> got there first, using its own tactics in order to enslave your mind to its desires. All you need to do is work – not just listening to fiery <i>mussar</i> lectures, but taking charge and doing real mental and spiritual work replete with tactics. In doing so, the initial heaviness and difficulty that precludes you from even starting will disappear. Just do it, Chassid, and when God helps you to temper your body and reveal your soul you will find the gates of our holy <i>sefarim</i> open before you and you will be on your way. Our intention is not to add to the words of the Chassidic Masters. It is only to prepare ourselves, making ourselves into worthy vessels, to go on the heels of their holy path, and to bring ourselves close to the splendor of their majesty. With the Almighty’s help, we will succeed in grasping the edge of their garment, hold on strong, and in this way go up to the house of God.
Your success all depends on the earnestness of your <i>avodah</i>. If you are doing it only in order to minimally fulfill your religious obligations, then all of our words are in vain. You will only be deceiving yourself, and furthermore you will come back fuming that you did everything and achieved nothing. But if you put great effort into your <i>avodah</i>, by being persistent in repeating the practices that you have learned, but not by serving in a superficial or matter-of-fact manner, then not only will the inherent thoughts, mental images, and deep feelings that already exist within become strengthened and sanctified, but you gain new ones, expanding the files of intense thought that you already have. The Gemara tells us that Rabbi Yehoshua’s teeth went black from prolonged fasting.<sup class="footnote-marker">171</sup><i class="footnote">Chagigah, 22.</i> Why was this? Since he spent years refraining from using his teeth for eating you might have thought that his teeth would only be strengthened. Yet in Chapter Two, we compared the soul to the Holy One, blessed be He who sees all and is not seen. We also find that God and the soul are both revealed in a similar way. They are both revealed through certain actions. Therefore, when you serve God and act with your teeth, or with any part of the body, a portion of the soul’s power that exists within that part of the body is revealed and strengthened. And when you desist in serving God with that body part, the life force of the soul connected to that body part becomes hidden. This concealment is revealed in the body. With fasting, for example, the teeth will go black, and the body will become thin and weak. So if the power of the body whose presence we readily feel is only strengthened through <i>avodas Hashem</i>, and the <i>avodah</i> serves to reveal that part of the soul, then how much more so will the thoughts and feelings of the hidden soul which is only revealed through action and <i>avodah</i>, gain strength within you when you continue to use them to serve and act. You soul will thrive as you continue to gain greater mastery over your holy thoughts and feelings, and your own inner work will make you into a far superior “<i>eesh Misragesh</i>” than you are now.
Clearly, if you employ the methods that we provided in order to intensify your thoughts, you will also be intensifying your <i>hisragshus</i>. Whether you are activating one of your files of intense thoughts about the Third Meal of Shabbos, or the Exodus from Egypt, or anything gleaned from your study of Tanach and Midrash, or any of the meditative methods described in holy <i>sefarim</i> that aid in the revelation of the <i>nefesh</i>, the meditations of your heart and mind will give way to intense emotion. Remember what we have mentioned earlier that the Israelite is by nature a man of intense feeling, a natural, “<i>eesh misragesh</i>,” and his soul is naturally aroused and stimulated. This itself is also problematic, as our weaker or less than holy thoughts could become a vessel for unwarranted <i>hisragshus</i>. You might have assumed that since we are already involved in the intensifying our thoughts, then there is no need to delve into the importance and fostering of <i>hisragshus</i>, as the intense thought will automatically take care of <i>hisragshus</i>. But it is not so. We are still obliged to direct our energies into the expansion of <i>hisragshus</i> on its own merits, in addition to our efforts towards intesifying thought. We are not permitted to leave any ability or method before having honed it to its maximum efficiency, for the more we can truly be counted among the masters of thought and men of holy sensitivity, the more we are worthy of being called Chassidim and the servants of God.
We are under obligation to sensitize our hearts, minds, and even our veins to various kinds of holy feelings in order to continually stimulate an increasing revelation of the <i>nefesh</i> experienced through greater <i>hisragshus</i> and more powerful <i>hislahavus</i> than would otherwise be possible if left unattended. This is a kind of Torah unto itself. That is to say, aside from the actual act of studying the Torah which is a mitzvah,<sup class="footnote-marker">172</sup><i class="footnote">This could be fulfilled by reading with minimal understanding.</i> man is also under obligation to reach the maturity in his Torah study where he truly grasps the wisdom of the Torah. This is true regardless of the fact that the <i>nefesh</i>, or in particular, the <i>neshama</i>, already knows the Torah without your intellectual understanding. But we need more than this. We need to get to the point where we feel the revelation of the Torah in the flesh of our brains and throughout our entire bodies. This revelation not only completes the flesh, but it also brings the <i>nefesh</i> to greater wholeness. The revelation of the Torah spreads forth from <i>Chochmah</i> - Wisdom to <i>Bina</i> – Understanding, and then to the rest of the <i>middos</i>. In this way, all of the details of the <i>neshama</i> are sanctified through the study of Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">173</sup><i class="footnote">God grants man wisdom and understanding. He does this by effusing knowledge from the supernal source down into man’s faculties. The first stations in the reception of this effluence of Godly information are known as Chochma – wisdom, and Bina – Understanding. These are commonly known as the intellect. The system of Sefirots situates the hidden intellectual sefiros, such as Chochma and Bina, above, and the revealed sefiros below. The revealed sefiros, known as middos, are expressed in the world in the soul of various actions. Some actions express love, others fear, others show a mediated balance between the two (tiferres). The Piasetzner Rebbe is telling us that the revelation of the Torah is expressed in physical actions imbued with the energy of the revealed sefiros, commonly known as the love of God, or the fear of God, or Tiferret, meaning pride in holy actions, or hiddur mitzvos, or an appreciation of the splendor of God in the world, and so forth. “The details of the neshama,” meaning the way the neshama is revealed in holy action, “is sanctified through the study of Torah,” when that study gives birth to holy action. Even if the study does not give birth to action, still it sanctifies the soul as it exists in the hidden, intellectual sefiros of Chochmah and Bina.</i> Then the <i>neshamos</i><sup class="footnote-marker">174</sup><i class="footnote">Neshamos, or souls, plural of neshama.</i> in the garden of Eden, no longer dressed in the garments of the body, also learn the Torah. Even though the <i>nefesh</i> unto itself feels great <i>hislahavus</i>, nonetheless, we find it necessary to increase our efforts in practices which foster <i>hisragshus</i>, in order to sensitize the flesh of our brains and hearts to holy <i>hisragshus</i> on a greater level than it would be left untouched and untended. In this way both our bodies and souls may be elevated and sanctified.
<i>Bachur</i>! <i>Avriech Chassid</i>! Since we have made it this far, we must leave aside the discussion for a moment in order to provide you with a sign by which you may evaluate yourself. This sign, or test, if you will, will let you know if you were just reading the words as if it were an airport novelette, or if our words have truly nourished your <i>avodas Hashem</i>. If your study of these words have truly been incorporated into your <i>avodah</i>, and your soul truly yearns to come up out from the swamp and into the purity and holiness of Hashem, if you rushed to take every piece of advice, and hastened to swallow every tablet of medicine to heal your ailing soul, already starting to put all of this advice into action and <i>avodah</i>, then you should already begin to feel a change for the better. You should already be thinking holy thoughts with strength, thinking them and seeing them in your mind’s eye more than you did previously. You should already be experiencing deep <i>hisragshus</i> not as you did before, but with greater fear and love, with a broken heart and with <i>simchah</i>. These experiences should not only be according to the ways in which we have described in the pages of this book, but they should well up on their own, in ways that were hitherto unknown to you, newly charged and surging from within your soul.
You may be somewhat perplexed at your new, sudden experiences of <i>hisragshus</i> and intense thoughts. You may be wondering, “Where did they come from? Who created these for me?” Do not be alarmed. Holy <i>sefarim</i> shine with wonder when they speak of the sublime heights of the Jewish soul and how we are at a loss to really understand it. In all honesty, you can say to any and every Jew, from the wood choppers to the water carriers,<sup class="footnote-marker">175</sup><i class="footnote">See the beginning of Parshas Nitsavim.</i> “clearly neither of us can really fathom the tremendous greatness and holiness that exists within you.” The Jew, the son of the Israelite nation, is really like a prince held prisoner in the pit of a jail in some backward country. He head and body is wrapped in soiled old rags. No one could recognize him - not even the prince himself if he were to look into a mirror. No one notices his precious and lofty soul or his keen mind. But only if one were to begin to remove the smelly rags that clothe him, or even more so if he were to hear the song that the royal orchestra plays in his father’s court, how great would be the fire that burns within him, and he would rise in his greatness and sing together with them. His song would silence the winds. All who heard it would freeze in wonderment. All would be humbled by his keen mind and profound wisdom, saying, “Look at this miracle that we never before imagined!”
With God’s help, each one will see the renewal of his soul in <i>avodas Hashem</i> in direct correspondence to how deeply he studied these words and how earnest he was in applying them to his own personal <i>avodah</i>. Small efforts will yield small results and great efforts will yield great results. But if you have been turning these pages not in order to enrich your <i>avodah</i>, but only out of mild curiosity, do not despair. Just finish the book, and then read it a second and third time, each time accepting a little more of its advice and directions and incorporating them into your behavior. With God’s help you will succeed in feeling. It is a five hundred year journey from the earth to the heavens, and no one can traverse such a distance with just one step.
Now we may return to our discussion. Not one of us is permitted to ignore any ability or method, and refrain from using it in order to reach the goal of becoming a master of intense thought and an “<i>eesh misraghesh</i>.” We are not to be satisfied with our natural talents in these arenas merely by virtue of being members of the Jewish people, nor even think that once we have developed them through ardent inner work that we need not strive for greater heights. If we do this, then with God’s help the goal envisioned in the beginning of this book – that we may feel the deep feelings of the soul (as it yearns) for <i>kedushah</i> - will be attained. The goal is not just to feel these feelings when they surface by themselves, but to be able to summon the feelings of <i>hisragshus</i> or even burning <i>hislahavus</i> at will and by choice, well within our powers as men of feeling. It is difficult to arouse compassion in someone who is cruel by nature. Only intermittently, and only as a result of witnessing another’s terrible suffering, God forbid, is his compassion aroused. This is not so for someone who is compassionate by nature. The innately compassionate can feel compassion easily, and for any slight suffering that confronts him. In the same way, if we remain insensitive, it is a difficult, if not nearly impossible task to bring about <i>hisragshus</i>. Yet when we succeed in becoming men of feeling, then each experience of <i>hisragshus</i> - few and far between, and only after a great struggle - will not be so precious. We will feel it in an instant, and whenever it is needed we will summon it by will.
As men of feeling we will be able to kindle <i>hisragshus</i> by choice, but still we need to learn how to behave in a way suited to personal experiences of <i>hisragshus</i>. This is a lengthy discussion, and for now we will be brief. But with God’s help we will continue with this topic at another time. We will discuss two different categories of <i>hisragshus</i>, and each of the two categories will be further divided into three sub-categories.
1) <i>Hisragshus</i> that comes from within, not aroused from any external stimulus.
A] <i>Hisragshus</i> that you feel in a “holy garment,” such as the love of God, the fear of God, deep feelings for the Torah and mitzvos, for <i>teshuvah</i>, love of Torah scholars, awe of Torah scholars, and so forth.
B] “Undressed <i>Hisragshus</i>,” just a pure feeling, such as broken-heartedness, or joy, or strength, where you do not know why you are feeling it, or what is bringing it about, like a vague hunger that needs to be fed.
C] A powerful feeling that comes in the garment of lust, God forbid.
2) Hisragshus that comes from without, where but for the external force that acts upon you and stirs your feelings you would not have felt it.
A] Externally aroused hisragshus dressed in a “holy garment.” For example, if you were punished (by some kind of suffering), God forbid, and this spurs you to feel the fear of God, or if God saved you from an accident, and this brings you to the love of God felt specifically through an increase of joy. Another example might be the love of God you feel through joyous emotion after hearing or reading a powerful piece of Torah or while <i>davening</i>.
B] “Undressed <i>hisragshus</i>.” This could include powerful feelings of broken-heartedness or joy that you feel upon hearing a <i>niggun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">176</sup><i class="footnote">Chassidic melody.</i> It could be that this broken-heartedness gives way to depression, or this joy leads to debauchery, God forbid, especially if he does not bring himself to use it for <i>kedushah</i>.
C] Deep feelings dressed in a garment of evil lust, God forbid. This is as our sages say, “the eyes and the heart are the two pimps of sin.”<sup class="footnote-marker">177</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi, Berachos, Perek 1 Halacha 1.</i> This could include hearing or otherwise sensing something that gives way to base or disgraceful conduct.
We have already made mention of <i>hisragshus</i> types A and B, meaning those feelings that come and are seen in holy garments, and “undressed hisragshus,” whether in the first category (internally stimulated feelings) or the second (externally stimulated feelings), both earlier in this book and in <b>A Student’s Obligation</b>. We will now provide you with a reliable and safe remedy to insure the proper use of such cases of <i>hisragshus</i> that I heard from my Holy Rav, master, and father in the name of the Ramban.
The Ramban tells us that when a good thought flashes in the mind, a person should take it and use it to perform a mitzvah, or use it to learn Torah, and in this way he dresses the good thought in <i>kedushah</i>. Therefore, if you find that you entertained a nondescript and brief thought of <i>teshuvah</i> (whether it came from within or was spurned on from some external source), and you need to expand upon it and put it into action, then even though you might assume that the best thing to do at that time is to seize that moment and learn matters of <i>teshuvah</i> in Torah, nonetheless, since the purpose of <i>teshuvah</i> is in order to come close to Torah and mitzvos, it follows that every matter of Torah and every mitzvah is a matter of <i>teshuvah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">178</sup><i class="footnote">That is to say, the performance of every mitzvah is a fulfillment of the objective of <i>teshuvah</i>.</i> Even if you end up learning about payment of damages from the case of the ox that gored the cow, or the laws of acquisition in the case of the man who traded his cow for another man’s donkey,<sup class="footnote-marker">179</sup><i class="footnote">See Kesubos, 76a.</i> it itself is a matter of <i>teshuvah</i>, and through it you are bringing yourself close to God and dressing this brief thought in <i>kedushah</i>. If it happens on Shabbos or Yom Tov, and your awakening is drawn to the special kedushah of Shabbos or the special kedushah of Yom Tov, then you should learn the Midrashim on the Zohar or in the writings of the Chassidic masters describing and explaining the kedushah of Shabbos and Yom Tov. Another way of seizing the moment and using that Shabbos or Yom Tov energy is by putting it into study of the weekly parshah.
As previously mentioned, when the holy masters were writing about the <i>kedushah</i> of Shabbos or Yom Tov, explaining the parshah, explaining any mitzvah, or, for that matter, saying anything,<sup class="footnote-marker">180</sup><i class="footnote">For even the so called mundane speech of Talmidei Chachamim is worthy of study.</i> even if their words took on the deeper form of a <i>drush</i> (or homily),<sup class="footnote-marker">181</sup><i class="footnote">a deeper level of interpretation, a homiletic teaching woven together from verses, laws, legends, and mysteries.</i> it was more than a <i>drush</i>. The <i>drush</i> itself became a garment for the holy fire of excitement that burned within them for Shabbos, or Yom Tov, or the parshah, or any mitzvah. The <i>drush</i> is the way that this burning fire is revealed in the world. And their holy tongues that spoke the drush are tongues of fire reaching out from the core inferno of holy desire ablaze within them. By studying their words and connecting to the heavenly fire you will not only reach a greater awakening, but your soul will dress in a new garment when the holy fire clothed in their words and teachings becomes a part of you. The sign that this has indeed happened is that you will never before in your life have felt such joy in learning Torah and Chassidus. This is because your <i>nefesh</i> now exists within the idea or subject that you are currently learning in the <i>sefer</i>, and you are delighting in witnessing your own <i>nefesh</i> inside the study. If it is not possible for you to learn about the very thing that brought about your awakening, such as Shabbos or Yom Tov or the like, then learn something else, Gemara or Midrash, or any matter in Torah. But do not be satisfied with a quick glance. Remove all other thoughts from your mind and immerse yourself in the <i>sefer</i> for as long as you are able. Every moment that you add to your study you will find yourself feeling greater and greater waves of <i>kedushah</i> and <i>hisragshus</i> sparked by <i>kedushah</i>.
Before you begin to engage in the study of Torah, whether in the revealed Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">182</sup><i class="footnote">Such as Halacha, Chumash with Rashi, Mishnayos and Gemara, and so forth.</i> or in Chassidus, have in mind that you seek to cleave to the Torah and to God, who exists within the Torah, in the very study that you are about to begin. This advice is found in the Tanya.<sup class="footnote-marker">183</sup><i class="footnote">Likutei Amarim, Chapter 4.</i> When you start studying after feeling an awakening of <i>kedushah</i> or teshuvah after you have finished studying or even in the middle of your study session between different subjects, try pausing for a moment and evaluate what it really is that you understand. Allow yourself to add to understanding you harvested from the subject at hand, whether it concerns the sanctity of Shabbos, or Yom Tov, or the parsha. Try in your own way to do it according to the style and methods that you see in the <i>sefer</i>. If you succeed in doing this, you are to be commended, for you have already created a new garment for your own holy hisragshus. If you don’t manage come up with anything new, don’t feel dejected. Simply review it over and over again, yearning or even praying to God to bring you closer and to sanctify you with the <i>kedushah</i> of Shabbos, Yom Tov, and the mitzvos. When a man feels the <i>kedushah</i> of Shabbos, while yearning and davening for God to sanctify him with this feeling of <i>kedushah</i>, then he is fulfilling the blessing that we often find ourselves saying, “who has sanctified us with his commandments,” or (in the Shabbos and festival prayer), “sanctify us with Your commandments.” And after you do this, continue with your study.
The first thing to keep in mind concerning the second category of “undressed <i>hisragshus</i>” is to not rush ahead by following the desires of your heart and dressing it in something physical. Rather examine your feelings. If you feel melancholy or are simply agitated, then you need to ask yourself some difficult questions. For example, ask yourself, “perhaps I sinned in the recent past? Perhaps I behaved in some base or ungainly way? Maybe I simply said or thought about something improper. Since I did these things with such haste I don’t even remember them. My whole life is passing by with such bewildering haste, but my soul only slows down, weakens and ails. Now my soul is groaning from the pains of my heart, and this is depressing me.” After a quick search you will remember how you were negligent, thinking, “yes, I did made this error, and entertained this desire,” and so forth. And the clear sign that you know what is indeed bothering you is that immediately upon identifying it, your sadness will be alleviated and you will start to feel better. But don’t just contend yourself with simply finding it. You need to take it upon yourself to stop behaving, speaking, or thinking in this way. And don’t be satisfied with just making a promise, because such promises are not worth much if they are not backed up by real strategies and tactics which will assist in the fulfillment of the promise.
However, whether or not you found the reasons for your depression, or whether it is in fact <i>hisragshus</i> of depression or <i>hisragshus</i> of simchah, whether of the first variety (coming from within) or of the second (stimulated from without), take it seriously. Don’t just pass it by and ignore it. Your soul is reaching out to you, so take hold of it, quickly! Hold onto it and don’t let it go. Try to expand upon your feeling. Say chapters of Tehillim that are suited to your situation in order to increase the breadth and depth of your feelings. In this way your <i>hisragshus</i> will not be fleeting, but something that you will be able to sustain for a longer period of time. If you are feeling depressed, say chapters 3, 6, 10, 13, 16, 17, 22, 25, 31, 38, 42. Put special effort into chapter 51, saying it many times. If your <i>hisragshus</i> is aroused by simchah, then say chapters that will increase your awakening of joy. These are chapters 1, 8, 9, 18, 19, 23, 24, 27, 29, 30, 33, 34. Other songs praising God are also helpful. But when you say them, don’t just say them as if you are retelling things that happened and were felt by King David thousands of years ago. Say them as if King David had written these words with you and your own personal experiences in mind. For example, when you say, “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?” picture yourself standing before God’s supernal throne of glory and pouring out your soul before Him. “My God, My God, why have you forsaken me, my family, and all of Israel? Why have you hidden Your face and made the world so dark?”
But if at this time it is impossible for you to learn or say Tehillim, then just speak to God.<sup class="footnote-marker">184</sup><i class="footnote">For more on this, see Histapchut HaNefesh, translated in English under the title, “Outpouring of the Soul,” a book which discusses the Breslov path of “<i>hisbodedus</i>.”</i> Speak to Him in your own words, pouring out your soul with a broken heart, with an elevated spirit, or with joy, depending on your current situation. For instance, you can say, “My Father, My King! I am so far away from You and Your <i>kedushah</i>. What will become of me at the end? Time and time again I want to be closer, and every time I find myself stuck in this horrible swamp. Master of the World! Have mercy on me, and soon enough I will bring myself close to You. Lift me up out of this swamp and save me together with all of Israel, both spiritually and physically, with good kindness and revealed kindness, and we will serve truly serve you, with joy, holiness, and purity!” And in all of these cases where you feel <i>hisragshus</i>, follow the advice of the Ramban, who advises us to take the feeling and clothe it in the performance of a mitzvah or Torah study.
The Chassidim strove to harness their sporadic emotions to <i>avodas Hashem</i>, and would further engage in activities that would wake up their feelings and use them in the service of God. Consider the example of drinking. Even though Chassidim explained a higher purpose in drinking liquor, explaining how Yaakov brought Yitchak wine in order to facilitate the revelation of the Shechinah over Yitschak at the time that he blessed Yaakov,<sup class="footnote-marker">185</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshis, 27:25. See Zohar, Toldos, 142b. “The wine goes in and the secret comes out.”</i> as the Zohar explains, “and he brought him wine – hinting a hint, bringing close that which was far away,” yet still, for every great and deep matter there is also the pshat, the simple meaning, especially for simple people like ourselves. Liquor arouses man’s heart and stirs his emotions. Yet in the worst cases, even if he doesn’t get intoxicated, the emotions that are stirred after drinking could get him excited about sinning, and he could go and dress his partially revealed soul in the wrong places, God forbid. The Chassid and <i>Baal Nefesh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">186</sup><i class="footnote">One who is sensitive to the proper service of God.</i> who seeks out the hidden crevices of his soul by candlelight, will say, “True, it only took a drink in order to arouse a part of my soul, but now I must seize upon this small revelation and not let it go until I serve God with a more greatly revealed soul, and not just according to the size of the revelation that the liquor allowed. Yet through my avodas Hashem, I will continue to reveal it, with <i>hisragshus</i>, with great sensetivity, and even with burning <i>hislahavus</i>.” You can do the same. Drink in the company of Chassidim, <i>Baalei Nefesh</i>, in this way and with this purpose in mind. Use it to bring about the <i>hisragshus</i> the soul, and with your soul revealed, you will add depth to your <i>avodah</i>. Since this is your intention and your preparation, rousing your soul by drinking in the company of Chassidim, you will feel how your soul is dressing in a holy garment. In this way you will be stimulated to <i>avodah</i> and faith. You will wake up to the love and fear of God.
The deep spiritual awakening that occurs while singing <i>niggunim</i>, so emphasized by the Chassidim, is a similar case. The world of <i>niggun</i> is very high, but simple people like us need a simple <i>avodah</i>. We need an avodah that we can study deeply, know, and use to serve. Once done, then the lofty greatness (of <i>niggun</i>) will be drawn down to us. We find the Beis Aharon explaining the verse in Shir HaShirim, “come, look from the peak of amanah,” “<i>niggun</i> is the head of faith.”<sup class="footnote-marker">187</sup><i class="footnote">Tashoori me’rosh amanah – look from the head of (mount) amanah – sounds similar to “sing from the head of faith.”</i>
Do not let it confuse you if you see that there are great <i>hazzanim</i> and singers whose hearts are far from God and are lacking in faith, God forbid. There are also many great singers among the other peoples of the world. But bear in mind that <i>niggun</i> is merely one form that the soul takes when it is revealed, but it does not determine what man will do at the time that he is aroused, and how he will use the portion of his soul that is revealed. Take, for example two men who are filled with joy. One takes his joy and uses it to serve God, and the other takes his joy and uses it for debauchery. So it is with <i>niggun</i>, one of the keys of the soul which arouses it and its feelings. One man could open his soul, letting part of it outside, and not only does he do nothing good with it, but he actually takes that portion and damages it, whether in joyous debauchery, or broken hearted depression and despair, to the point where he looses all trust in God and faith, doing things which are never to be done, God forbid. Since our intention in releasing the soul is so that it may rule over our bodies, connecting it to God’s <i>kedushah</i>, and nullifying it together with our very beings in the soul of the Almighty, therefore we accustom ourselves to expressions of joy, and pour out our souls to heaven in song. It is not that we need to create new <i>niggunim</i>. For obviously, someone who enjoys wine doesn’t need to make the wine himself, and someone who wants to inspire another with words doesn’t need to invent a new language.
Take a <i>niggun</i>, or even a musical phrase from a <i>niggun</i>, and turn your face to the wall, or simply close your eyes. Then imagine once again that you are standing before God’s supernal throne of glory, and you have come to pour out the deepest feelings of your heart before God through song and <i>niggun</i>. Then you will naturally feel that your soul is going out in the song of your prayer. If at first you were singing in order to wake up your soul from its slumber, the gradually, as you continue, you will find your soul gaining independence and singing on its own.
<i>Niggunim</i> were always a mystery to you. What are these sounds? What are these melodic ascents and descents, sometimes sudden, and sometimes slow? Now you already see everything, your soul’s voice breaking through to the heights, and seemingly holding on to the heavens with its murmuring and drawing it close to you with its tongue. Its heart, belly, and all of its insides are drawn forth with the melody, ascending on its voices. Its ascents, descents, all of its twists and turns are carved into its sound, a woven tapestry of the soul. Your soul bears the <i>niggun</i> in its womb. Giving birth to it draws you closer to God.
Sometimes when you sing you unknowingly say things before God. At first they still make known the desires of your body, but the deeper you feel, the more your soul will come out of hiding to take wing and soar on high. In this way you will abandon the world, and you will cry out the purest of prayers before God from the depths of your heart. Don’t dismiss the things that you find yourself saying in the midst of song, for they are words of prayer that are not found in the prayerbooks, but rather words that flow from the depths of your heart and are hewn from the quarry of your soul.
At other times you will not have an awakening of words or feel any specific requests. But still, you feel something that you find hard to describe. It is a kind of embrace, like a beloved, if a little spoiled, child before his father, who really doesn’t want anything from his father, but just coos and groans, “Daddy, Daddy!” His father asks him, “what do you want, my son?” “Nothing,” the son answers, but he keeps cooing, “Daddy, Daddy!” We have much to learn about the revelation of the soul from the behavior of children. A child’s actions are unintentional, his soul is revealed by itself in different ways, moving and acting according to the movements of his soul. Also the currying of affection described above is really the pouring out of his soul to the soul of his father. In the course of your song, you may also feel like the sweet, spoiled<i></i> child cooing for affection, not wanting anything specific, only your soul sings out, pours out, rushes out, “Master of the world! Master of the world!”
It does not have to come through the <i>niggun</i> of a broken heart, but could also come from a <i>niggun</i> of joy. All moods can be used to reveal the soul, for this is the way of the Chassid. Sometimes during a joyous <i>niggun</i> and dance he starts crying, and sometimes when he is crying he feels joy.
Therefore, when you are with the Chassidim when they get together and sing, whether at times of prayer, at festive meals, or any other times, sing with them. Not in the way of, “it cries out against me,”<sup class="footnote-marker">188</sup><i class="footnote">See Yirmiyah, 12:8, “My heritage is to me like a lion in the forest; it cries out against me; therefore have I hated it.”</i> but in order to free your soul and raise it on high, in the way of, “And it came to pass, when the musician played, that the hand of Hashem came upon him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">189</sup><i class="footnote">See Melachim 2, 3:15.</i> It should be like the <i>niggun</i> under the <i>chuppah</i> which unites the bride and groom. (The wise reader will understand.<sup class="footnote-marker">190</sup><i class="footnote">“Dye l’mevin,” this is a kind of hint at a deeper meaning intended for individuals possessing some level of kabbalistic knowledge.</i>) It doesn’t even have to be at a time when the Chassidim have assembled and are singing, but you could sing as described above even when you are alone at home, at any time you feel the proper state of mind. You don’t need to shout your head off in order to do this, for it could be that your singing is but a murmuring whisper and it rings out in the highest heavens.
With little effort you can elevate your everyday feelings. In this case we are dealing with <i>hisragshus</i> that is not completely undressed, meaning not just an isolated feeling, but not even dressed in the desire to do or achieve anything, just simple joy or sorrow over something that happened to you. It is not related to a mitzvah and not spurned on by lust, just and everyday event. Take your feelings of joy or worry over everyday events, and expand upon them by speaking about them in your private conversations with God. In doing this, your soul will naturally take them and elevate them to holy <i>hisragshus</i>. With the Israelite, every kind of <i>hisragshus</i> is connected to the revelation of the soul, whether the feeling comes through business or the body, regardless of whether the feeling is broken hearted or joyous. This kind of revelation is just dressed in worldly matters, and you only need act on your decision to use it in a kosher way. When you feel broken hearted, even from physical needs, immediately take a step aside. Stand up facing the wall and use the techniques described above, such as saying a few chapters of Tehillim relevant to your situation and your feelings. For example, if you are currently worried about someone who hates you, then daven Psalms three and four, saying, “O Eternal, how numerous are my tormentors, many are those who rise up against me.” If you have a different worry, then your prayer could be, “I am sunk in muddy depths,” (Chapter 69), or, “I will lift my eyes to the mountains, from where will my help come?” (Chapter 121)
Clearly, you shouldn’t mindlessly, heartlessly, recite these words the minute you come home from the supermarket. But rather, prepare yourself by contemplating the worries and obstacles that disturb you. Who can you turn to? Who will save you from them if not the All-Powerful, the Merciful Father, the Holy One, blessed be He? You are no less than coming before His supernal throne of glory, envisioning the glory of God, standing and pleading, “O God, how numerous are my tormentors … many say of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God … (but still,) You are a shield around me …” After you say the words of the Tehillim, continue by saying your own words. Say to God whatever comes into your mind. Then from sentence to sentence, from word to word, you will feel that your soul and your thoughts are gaining strength and ascending. Gradually you abandon the needs of your body, and a cry wells up from the depth of your heart, “Master of the world! Bring me close to You! Purify me! Raise me out of all of these worries, in order that I may be close to You with a pure heart and soul.” Then after your prayer, it is good to say verses of strengthening and encouragement, such as “God is my shepherd, I shall not lack … no evil shall befall me, because, Master of the world! You are with me.” And from now on you will feel the joy that comes with the knowledge that God is with you. And He really is with you, specifically right now while you pour your heart out before Him you will feel elevation and closeness to the Almighty and Ever-Present. For the rest of the day that you <i>daven</i> with such depth, you will feel a truly satisfying delight and purity. After all, your soul has been in the Garden of Eden, and what can compare to such joy?
And similarly, at a time when you feel such joy, even if it is the joy of physical salvation, don’t be so quick to leave such a fortuitous moment as when the spark of the soul is revealed. Stand where your soul views the heavens<sup class="footnote-marker">191</sup><i class="footnote">“B’zavit,” literally, from a viewpoint. The word could be dressed with the association of “shining” (Ziv), “beholding the pleasantness of God’s shining light.” In teaching us about how to stand and <i>daven</i>, Holy Sefarim say, “look at the earth but have your mind on the Heavens.”</i> and say a few more chapters of Tehillim [yet it is advisable at such a time not to say too many Tehilim], like chapter 18, “I love You, O Eternal, my strength … my rock and my fortress, I seek shelter with Him, my shield and the horn or my salvation, my support …” Then when you finish your Tehillim, continue to speak in your own words, “Ribono Shel Olam, Master of the world! I am so thankful for Your great kindness in watching over me, helping me with Your great mercies. You are always leading me for the good, and in particular right now, by saving me at this time in this way.” You will continue to feel an ascent of the soul, from physical joy to joy in God.
In this way you will not let go of even a simple sigh, for even the slightest and simplest of sighs that comes forth from the heart of Israel can bring about an awesome revelation of the nefesh, and you can use it to bring the <i>nefesh</i> closer to God.
It is not only the second variety of <i>hisragshus</i> (where nothing external sets off this emotion, it is just a feeling that has not yet dressed in anything physical) that you can use for <i>avodas Hashem</i>, to intensify your feelings for Hashem, but even the <i>hisragshus</i> of the third variety (where you already feel desire and <i>hisragshus</i> for something physical) can be used to augment your love and fear of God. We have already quoted holy <i>sefarim</i> that tell us how for the Israelite, even the animal soul, the source of all worldly desires, is a holy entity, as it is rooted in the face of the ox on God’s chariot. It is <i>only</i> that it is dressed in low garments, and thus desires low things. Man’s job is to remove it from its evil garment and dress it in a garment of <i>kedushah</i>. When a man is aroused to such desires, it contains two elements. The first element is the <i>hisragshus</i> of the <i>nefesh</i> that we search after with so much effort. And the second element is the evil garment that covers the illumination of the <i>nefesh</i> and its feelings. If only man felt it as two distinct elements, that which was being dressed, and the garment dressing it; the <i>hisragshus</i> by itself, and also the vile, polluted rubbish by itself. If so we would not need to be so wary of dangers in the course of our <i>avodah</i>. The trouble is precisely that we feel them together as one, as if they were not two things but one thing - one low feeling for something or other. The masters of Chassidus have taught us that it is not enough for man to refrain from his evil lusts, but he is under obligation to transform every desire for evil into a desire for <i>kedushah</i>. The purpose of avodah is to reach the point where that very same animal desire that seeks evil has now been transformed and now only seeks the good and the holy. As was mentioned earlier, the Torah hints at this when Moshe tells Pharaoh that he will be taking even the animals of the Egyptians in order to sacrifice them in the desert. “We must take it to serve God,”<sup class="footnote-marker">192</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos, 10:26</i> which tells us, we will also transform the evil portion of the animal soul and use it to serve God.
But how can a man do this if he doesn’t feel two distinct elements, but only one desire? This is even more problematic, since the desire for low things is generally a strong one. Furthermore, in order for man to be able to heal his thoughts, feelings, attributes, tendencies, and other defects of the soul by applying specific methods and heeding certain advice, just like medical treatments for the body, he must first recognize them, their natures, their ways, and all the specific tendencies of the soul, just as a doctor has to be expert in the anatomy and workings of the body in order to help the patient to heal. This is discussed in the first chapter of the Shemonah Perakim of the Rambam. We pray to God to allow us to provide a full detailed discussion of this subject at a later time. But for now, <i>Bachur</i>, <i>Avreich</i>, we will provide you with a <i>segulah</i> (a wondrously effective piece of advice). It is not fool proof. We cannot promise you that this <i>segulah</i> will allow you to do away with the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> once and for all, because a fool proof antidote for the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> and man’s ability to choose evil is not yet in existence. But we can tell you this. If you do not become lazy, but rather use it well, then with God’s help it will help you tremendously, and you will be amazed at the great effects it will have upon you.
Shlomo HaMelech said, “Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">193</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei, 29:20</i> The Holy man, Rav of all the Jews of the Diaspora, our master the Baal Shem Tov, once explained the verse in the Shema, “<i>ve’avadtem m’herah</i> – and you will quickly be destroyed,” to mean, “you need to destroy your undue haste.” He was telling us that man needs to be calm and collected in his thoughts, as opposed to rushed and frenzied. If a person finds it difficult to work when his mind is not calm, when his thoughts are rushing and pressured, then how much more so is this true regarding the inner work <i>avodas Hashem</i>. When a person reflects upon his life and puts his mind on self-improvement, whether he wants to take charge of his thoughts and cure his wanton tendencies or develop other abilities like, such as the power to master his feelings and transform evil desires into good ones, he must first know that he cannot even begin the transformation if his mind is frenzied. And if he begins in such a state, that you might call “the minds mad rush,” he is already closer to loosing than winning, for he will twist and bend everything in order to convince himself that the problem has already fixed itself. Therefore we find it necessary to warn you, <i>Bachur</i>, <i>Avriech Chassid</i>, that if it is your dream to fulfill the purpose of this book, whether concerning matters that have already been discussed and you have already started, or concerning matters that you have not yet begun, and your desire is to take the reigns in your hands and rule over your own body, thoughts, and middos, then do not be overly hasty. Rather, you need to fulfill the Holy Baal Shem Tov’s interpretation of the verse, “<i>ve’avadtem m’herah</i> – and you will quickly be destroyed.”<sup class="footnote-marker">194</sup><i class="footnote">This is found in the second paragraph of the Shema Yisrael.</i> By tailoring the grammar this reads, “do away with the haste.” In other words, the first thing to destroy is the mind’s frenzied haste that rushes forth without thinking. You can only succeed by looking at your world and your life with a feeling of <i>nachas</i> and calm mind, but never through haste and the self-deception that it breeds.
Let us return to the original subject. We are under obligation to flay the soul of its polluted garments and the evil lusts that are manifest in this kind of untamed <i>hisragshus</i>. It is not enough to hold back from acting upon the lusts while their fires are free to rage within us and the polluted garment only increases its hold on our souls. Rather we should cease from lusting, and strip this part of the soul that was aroused from the foul garment that it was wearing. In this way we will regain this portion of the soul, which is now free to wake up to holy <i>avodah</i>. How can this be done? In <b>A Student’s Obligation</b> we interpreted the verse, “turn from evil and do good,” based on a number of holy <i>sefarim</i>, which tell us that simply by doing good you allow yourself to turn from evil. Just by increasing your efforts in Torah study and good deeds will cause the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> to turn away from you and leave you alone. But are we on such a level that we could actually kill the <i>yetser ha’rah</i>? Could we ever be clean of its influence and remain forever without lust, where it would never irk us, each one according to his own particular case? What would the miserable one do at this ugly hour? How his lust would wane, and how all of his excitement over all of his schemes would be doused!
To find the answer, you must look inside yourself, and you will see a law of human nature. When you treat a rustling of the soul,<sup class="footnote-marker">195</sup><i class="footnote">“Rachash,” as in Psalm 45, “Rachash libi d’var tov.” “my heart was moved with a goodly matter.” (Margolin) <i>Rachash</i> the noise of something moving or rustling. We will use, “rustling of the soul,” or “rustling of emotion.” Rustling connotes both noise and moment.</i> whether it is the noise of the imagination, desire or emotion, love or fear, or any other attribute, even if the treatment is done with the mind, then the very mind’s treatment of the rustling only serves to enhance it, stimulating it even further. But if the goal of the mind’s treatment of this unwanted emotional noise is to look at it objectively – <i>from the outside</i> - thinking about the reasons behind the fantasy, the desire, the love, the fear, then to the contrary, the mind’s treatment and investigation about the circumstances of the emotion will weaken it, and even cause it to cease. It is not just the treatment that will stop it, but also the way of rational introspection, the particular way in which you take an objective look at the rustling of your thoughts and emotions, that dulls its potency.
For example, think about the person who is closest to you, who you see on a daily basis. The more you encourage this rustling of the soul – which is the image which you are encouraging your mind to produce – expanding your thoughts to imagine just how this person eats, how he drinks, how he speaks, etc., then as your thoughts progress, you will continually broaden and sensitize the arousal of your mental picture. This will not be so if you don’t treat the actual source of the emotional noise or image, but only dwell on the noise or the circumstances surrounding the image. Start by asking a very basic question. “Should I entertain this thought or not?” Then when you only just begin to think objectively about it, and not only when you are already treating its circumstances in your mind, but even when you begin to look at this image that you conjured up in your mind, and you think, “what image am I now drawing? My father,” and so forth, then just the act of looking at it (objectively, from the outside) will cause the intensity of this image to dim in your mind, and you will not be able to draw such a mental picture that had previously been so familiar.
So it is with the rustlings of the desire for love. Take for example a good friend. You both love each other very much. If you treat this love, and even if you involve your mind in the treatment, your will find yourself thinking, “I have such a great love for my friend. What would I do for this love? It could be that I buy him a gift, it could be that I do him a favor.” You imagine how you indulge your love, how you speak to each other when you see each other, how the feeling of love grows greater, making you more sensitive. But if you do not treat the love itself, but rather objectively examine the circumstances of the love then you will be asking yourself, “do I really love him? Perhaps I don’t really love him, it is just that I don’t hate him. And why do I love him? Why should I continue to show such great love for him?” and so forth. Then even if you do not find any reason not to love him, still, the mind’s observation and treatment of this rustling of love will cause it to diminish, even if it doesn’t fade away as quickly as the mental image did in the previous example. And if you continue to think objectively about its circumstances, it will cool off completely. The love does not go away as easily as the mental image because the mental image is not as deeply rooted in your inner being. It is just an image. This is not so with the love, which has anchored itself in your heart and middos, and is therefore harder to remove. But still, using this practice of objective analysis will cause it to cool off and fade away. It really depends on how deeply rooted the love is within you. A weak love will go away more quickly when you assess its circumstances, and a stronger love will put up a greater fight before it is completely removed. It also depends on the quality of the treatment. A broader and more thorough treatment will weaken it faster.
At this point you have a tactic with which to fight the war. But remember this. Granted that it is impossible for a soldier to go directly into the battlefield before he has undergone basic training. This is as David HaMelech said, “to teach archery to the Judeans.”<sup class="footnote-marker">196</sup><i class="footnote">Shmuel 2, 1:18</i> Well before he is standing next to his despised enemy who is ready to murder him in an instant he needs to undergo training and practice with his fellow soldiers who oppose him only in order to train, but certainly are not in order to kill him. An army will undergo training maneuvers, or war games, dividing itself into two opposing forces to prepare themselves to fight the enemy. And if they find that they stand up to the war in their training, then their minds and bodies are strengthened, their confidence is high, and they can go forth courageously and win against the one who really wants to kill them. So in the same way, someone who turns a blind eye to the small rustlings and stirrings of the heart, rationalizing that there is no sin and they don’t even arouse his desire so much, so he leaves them alone and lets them have their way with his heart and body, then when he comes to a powerful desire which may even be forbidden, how greatly will he struggle and sweat in order to overcome it and drive it away. And there is no guarantee that he will be able to overcome his <i>yetser</i> at that time. This is all because he did not “prepare himself in the art of archery,” against his small enemies, not working his way up by winning little battles against things that carry no sin and little allure. And as if that is not enough, he will remain a coward, a sprout in early spring that cannot hold up to even the slightest wind, where <i>yetser ha’rah</i> needs only to gesture to him for his knees to go limp and land him on his face. The Beis Aharon<sup class="footnote-marker">197</sup><i class="footnote">In the liqutim at the end.</i> interprets the words of the Shabbos <i>zemer</i>, “<i>chafetseicha assurim</i> – your desires are forbidden” to mean exactly what it says, “no matter how much you want to, you are simply not allowed to do it.”
In light of this, if you truly do not want to be considered among the wicked whose hearts posses them, but among the righteous who possess and control their hearts, and not to be fair game for any desire that comes your way, God forbid, but to wield mastery over yourself and your soul,<sup class="footnote-marker">198</sup><i class="footnote">See the midrash in Devarim Rabbah, Parshah 2.</i> then go ahead and use the tactic of the external objective analysis on the feelings that stir and rustle within you. But be sure to begin with smaller, less powerful feelings. For example, if two kinds of meat are brought before you for dinner, one that find particularly delicious and arousing your desire, and another that you do not like so much, then take the second kind and don’t take the one you crave. Don’t say to yourself, “so what! I’m not breaking any laws. And furthermore, my desire is not so great that I need to put up a fight against it.” Have mercy on yourself an on your <i>nefesh</i>, and begin your fight against the small sprouts of your desire. Make yourself into a courageous warrior of the soul who rules over himself and fully possesses his own heart. I promise you that once you use this tactic in the case of the two pieces of meat, you will never need to use it again, for your situation is not so bad that for every piece of meat you come across you have to deliver over your very soul in order not to fall prey to the <i>yetser ha’rah</i>. For you know that it is the way of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> to test you in one way today and a different way tomorrow.
However, it could be that your situation is so dire and the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> is grabbing you by the neck so strongly that even the case of the meat is difficult for you. Then if they offer you enticing candies and tasty foods before you which inspire such a strong desire that it is hard for you to break free, you may find yourself “putting a spin” on your sin and convincing yourself that it is not so serious, saying, “so what if I eat them or don’t eat them. People eat this kind of stuff all the time!” If so, now is the time to put the above advice into practice. Take an outside look at your desire and say to yourself, “Truly, my desire is so great to eat this that I don’t even want to enter into a discussion of whether I need to eat this or not. It could be that there really is no sin in eating this now. But now it is clear to me that I have overpowering desires. And as such it is also clear to me that I am altogether under the influence of these desires, and to such an extent that it is hard for me not to eat this food. After all, I’m not about to die if I don’t eat it! It is totally ridiculous for me to be so attached to it!” With your mind, look at yourself and at your desires. Then, in your treatment of its external circumstances, say to it, “I know that I am not a Tsaddik, but I never thought that I could be such an glutton as to let these tasty foods reduce me to <i>nothing</i>.” Take a hard look at it, and say these words over again a few times. Then you will be amazed at how with God’s help your desires will weaken, and even completely dissipate. Try this method with your eating, and also try it with other desires. You could even use it idle speech, which is certainly not a sin, but something you are better off without. Such idle speech is something unnecessary that irks and compels you, so look at it and its temptations with this method.
If you feel the awakening of a bad character trait, whether you feel jealous or hate someone, and even though you are aware that it is something to get rid of but find it difficult to do so, or any evil fancy that strikes you and you find it difficult to push it away and nullify it, then use this method. And if you are not currently standing in prayer, or if you are praying and have reached a place where you can pause, then say the verse, “esh tamid tookad al hamizbeach lo sichbei – burn a continual fire on the altar, it shall not be extinguished,”<sup class="footnote-marker">199</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra, 6:6</i> a practice recorded in the Ari <i>z”l</i> siddur in the name of the Ramak that he received from Elijah the Prophet. Or say with all of your strength, “haCna’ani haChitti haEmori ve’haPritzi ve’haYevusi ve’haGirgashi,”<sup class="footnote-marker">200</sup><i class="footnote">These are six of the names of the seven nations that lived in the land of Cana’an before the arrival of the children of Israel. Nechemia, 9:8</i> as my holy ancestor, Rebbe Elimelech of Lyzhensk advises us in the <b>Tseitl Katan</b>. And the <b>Maor VaShemesh</b> tells us that it is good to change, sometimes saying the first verse, and sometimes the second, because when you overdo any one method it looses its power. However, if you are standing in prayer in a place where it is forbidden to interrupt, then use the following tactic. Look at this disturbing or evil attribute which has come to you, and envision it as a cruel, vile, and filthy animal that has jumped into your mind, and its filthy feet are defiling the holy place within you. It opens its dreadful maw and nibbles away at the strands and sinews of your very soul. Be careful not to think the evil thought itself, but just think about the evil thought, and about the evil animal which destroys you, body and soul, God forbid. You should be in a complete state of shock, and cry out in your heart, “am I like an adulterer (God forbid)?<sup class="footnote-marker">201</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe Zts”l actually writes, “am I an adulterer.” For someone who is not actually engaged in adultery, God forbid, this is an analogy. That is to say, entertaining or even whoring after a distracting or enticing thought while praying is analogous to cheating on God.</i> Am I already rotting in the lowest pit of hell (God protect us)? If you want to use this method at a time when you are not <i>davening</i>, then you can actually say these words out loud the way you said them to yourself in the bitterness of your heart.
Again we must warn you as we did previously in chapter five about the test that you can use to discern whether or not you are feeling true <i>hislahavus</i>. There we said that since a personal inner aspect is not like a physical and tangible element, it is therefore it is hard for a person not to unwittingly deceive himself. Similarly, when you are taking an external, objective look at the circumstances surrounding the stirring of desire, or surrounding evil thoughts and attributes, it is also difficult. Sometimes one is unaware that he is looking at his soul’s rustling or the desire itself through under the seductive power of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i>, and he is convinced that he is merely looking at the external circumstances. Then he wonders why the method did not work, and why the power of the desire has not decreased. This method, as with all kinds of deep introspection, takes much patient meditation and getting used to in order to truly know their ways and truly feel their effects.
For example, if a child’s Rav takes him and forces him to go to <i>cheder</i> and study, and in addition to the games he plays and the fun he has with the other children, he studies with the Rav and in the course of the study he answers all of the Rav’s questions, still, all of the child’s desires and thoughts will be on the playtime. It is similar with an adult. If a man is sunk in thought about a particular matter, and someone asks him about a different matter, even if he answers him, still, his entire mind remains sunk in the previous matter. That is to say, even though right now the child is already thinking about the subject he is learning, and the man is thinking about the question that he is asked, still, his mind is still absorbed in the game or the matter that he was thinking about before. It is just that in the midst of mental absorption, he used the little bit of his mind that was necessary in order to answer the question. This is all in order to show you that you may remain entirely within your thoughts, and your desire totally involved in the rustling of your emotion, and even at the time when you are thinking about the thought and not actually thinking the thought itself, that this “thinking about,” is just a little bit of your mind that is being used in order to think “about it,” in order to fulfill the advice mentioned. Then you can say to yourself, “I already thought about it.” Even at the time you ask the question, “am I filled with lusts,” you could be thoroughly sunk in your desires and your thoughts immersed in lust. In such a case your efforts to think objectively “about” the desire will be fruitless. At this time it would be good to mention the words of the holy Rav, Rav Osher haGadol of Stolin, who said, “they are shouting at the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> with the <i>yetser ha’rah</i>, so therefore the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> is not afraid of them. But we shout at the <i>yetser ha’rah</i> with Hashem, may He be blessed, so he runs for his life!” Remember these holy words, for it is not uncommon that a man thinks that he is shouting at the <i>yetser ha’rah</i>, but he is using the very <i>yetser ha’rah</i> in order to shout. And as for our discussion, there are those who think that they are thinking objectively about the lust and the evil thought in order to destroy it, and in reality that very objective thought is lust. He is using it to think, and he does not destroy the evil, but actually strengthens it, Heaven forfend.
Although it is quite difficult to break your desires to the point where you no longer feel them, still, it is possible to say to yourself, “yes, in the future I will be feeling the desire, but aren’t I allowed to interrupt the desire for twenty seconds, and in that brief span of time that I am not immersed in them I can just think about the desire from the outside, and truly not be inside of them?”
If your situation is so grave that even a twenty second break from the desire is hard for you, then try this. Direct your mind on something else which is quite important to you, whether it is something that you love or something that you hate and fear. It could even be a business or financial matter. This other, being so important to you, will manage to stop your desires for a few moments, and free your mind to think about it and not with it. If you have indeed fallen into such dire straits, then it is advisable that at that time you contend yourself with silently observing your thoughts and feelings without actually speaking about it out loud, unless your heart is so pained by your awful situation that it cannot help but to cry out on its own,am I …” as mentioned before. When a man chooses not to open his mouth and articulate a difficult thought, then in many cases he may force himself to think it. However, if he does say it, then to the contrary, he deceives himself, and satisfied that he said it, he does not force himself to think it. So if you say them together with all of the other things you say without thinking about what you really mean,<sup class="footnote-marker">202</sup><i class="footnote">We are concerned with the ultimate purpose and merits of our thoughts, speech, and action, where they lead us, and what kind of a world they create.</i> then saying this will be of no benefit to you.
But even though observing one’s thoughts and all of related activities is indeed difficult, the main difficulty is at the beginning, before you are accustomed to these kinds of exercises. After you get used to them, you will find them a little easier. All beginnings are difficult. The entire brain, down to every strand of sinew and nerve, has to accustom itself to such fine inner work, but once done it will become easier.
Among the directions and warnings provided in <b>A Student’s Obligation</b>, we mentioned that if you ever find it difficult to overcome something, such as getting over your laziness and being industrious, then think to yourself, “would I be willing to loose my share in the world to come for this?” Don’t equate our discussion here with what was said in <b>A Student’s Obligation</b>, because there we were speaking principally to young adolescents, or to you when you were younger, and we could not expect people at that stage of development to be ready for such stringent mental <i>avodah</i>, which is difficult even for adults. Therefore when you were younger we advised you to scold yourself, whether in your thoughts or with words, as if someone else were scolding you. But we were not yet sure if your heart would be subdued before such scolding.
It is not so now, when we are talking to young men, at a more mature stage of development, and to <i>Avreichim</i>, who actively seek to rectify their thoughts and have the ability to do so. So continue to use this method of scolding yourself, in a way commensurate with your maturity, but here we are teaching you a stronger and more natural method to combat unwarranted <i>hisragshus</i> and wear down their strength. Indeed it is the nature of evil thoughts and feelings to be weakened when you scrutinize them in the way of intense thought.
It is similar to a situation where a man sees his fellow looking at something forbidden. He does not open his mouth to reprimand his fellow over his improper behavior, thinking that he won’t listen to him anyway, but he manages to somehow prevent his fellow from looking at it for a period of time. In that way, whether or not his fellow would listen to him, the bottom line is that he is prevented from seeing it. If you only do what you have been told, without any self deception, then whether you want to keep listening to your <i>yetser</i> or don’t want to keep listening to it, then almost against your will you will find your self despising evil thoughts and feelings, and they will disappear. We cannot guarantee you that this will banish them forever and that they will not come back to haunt you at a later time, because a method is only a temporary measure, whose purpose is only to weaken it and distance it at that time that the method is employed and for a period of time to follow. Given time, it could come back. Then once you have successfully deflected it two or three times, then it will always be weaker. Then if it returns to irk you, it will not appear and entice you with the same strength and intensity as before. Rather it will come shame-faced and in secret, trying to sneak into your mind like a thief trying to break into a house. Then a simple glare at it will cause it to melt and slither away with its tail between its legs, no longer appearing and beckoning you with its wiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">203</sup><i class="footnote">(The original text adds the following note.) It will have this debilitating effect on the thought that you are currently observing, but not on other evil thoughts and feelings. You need to look at each one at the time when it confronts you.</i>
Now that I have assured you that, with God’s help, this tactic will help you in your fight against the <i>hisragshus</i> that you feel even for lusts, jealousy, or other evil attributes and tendencies, and not only to stop you from indulging your desire for food, or preventing you from taking revenge on your adversary, while all the while the desire and hatred stays within you, even welling up on occasion, but now the desire has even grown weaker within you, your feelings are quieter, and inside you feel a new sensation of satisfaction and enjoyment. Some will not know what this enjoyment is, but you will simply feel satisfied that they have been saved from desire, feeling the pleasure of victory over your own desires and of being one of God’s valiant soldiers of the spirit. You know that you withstood the test, for if you had failed you would be feeling sorrow, and your spirit would be broken within you. You would look at yourself with scorn, feeling like a dishrag. What a letdown it is to be a grown man beaten by candies. But what scares you even more is that you took one step closer to the side of evil, and who knows where this could lead. But now you withstood the test, thank God. Yet even though you succeeded, you know that in this you didn’t fulfill the 613 commandments, and the gates of the Garden of Eden are not yet open before you because of this little victory. But you can feel satisfaction in that you took one step closer to <i>kedushah</i>, and if you can do this, with God’s help, you will be able to fulfill all of the commandments, for who will be able to stop you?
Indeed the awareness of your enjoyment is as we have described, but there is more to it. There are reasons behind your enjoyment, and these reasons are unknown to you. Similarly, this enjoyment that you are aware of, the satisfaction of victory, is rooted in something unknown to you. A portion of your soul has stripped away a polluted garment of evil <i>hisragshus</i>, and you have now gained the revelation of this portion of your soul. The secret reason behind your newly found enjoyment is the closeness to kedushah that your perseverance has afforded you. Yes, it has brought you closer, but be aware that you have come closer to the <i>kedushah</i> that exists within yourself. You have come closer to your soul. Consider how far away you had been, and the great step you now took to come back. You took an awakening of desire within you and used it to reveal a portion of your soul rooted in the face of the ox on God’s holy chariot, now revealed free of the evil garment. Therefore, dear <i>Bachur</i> and <i>Avreich</i>, if you truly want to take good care of your soul and be a <i>baal nefesh</i>, then don’t wait any longer and seize the opportunity. Take this revelation and awakening of your soul and use it in the same way that you did with the first and second kinds mentioned above, namely expanding the revelation and pouring it into a mitzvah or Torah study, which is equal to them all.<sup class="footnote-marker">204</sup><i class="footnote">Peah, 1:1 see birchas haTorah. “Talmud Torah cneged culam” meaning that every form of Torah study assists and expands the revelation of the soul and aids in the rectification of desire.</i> And it shall be well with you.<sup class="footnote-marker">205</sup><i class="footnote">“ve’tov lach,” See Tehillim 128:2, “You shall eat the work of your hands; happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you.” The Talmud notes, “happy shall you be – in this world, and it shall be well with you – in the world to come.” Which means for our context that such inner work, the rectification of desire and the revelation of the soul as expanded by Torah and mitzvos will benefit the health and strength of man’s soul in the world to come.</i>
There is another ability which is crucial to you that you have gained from our discussion. Now you have a broom with which to sweep away unwanted thoughts, not unwarranted desires, but permitted, everyday thoughts that flow through your mind and confuse you when you are trying to pray. When you stand to pray and the rowdy gang of thoughts comes to incessantly harass you, I am doubtful whether the sheer force of your mind can drive them away. Sometimes this only strengthens them to irk you even more. Therefore, you are advised to pause momentarily from your davening and collect yourself. If you are permitted at this point of the davening to sit, then by all means, sit. And if not, lean against something and relax<sup class="footnote-marker">206</sup><i class="footnote">“Bi’menuchas lev, - with the resting of the heart.” (The original text adds) Make sure that your heart is in fact resting, but don’t fume with anger and don’t exert yourself, for as we explained earlier concerning matters of thought that sometimes, when you struggle (or try to force something), you don’t achieve what you want to.</i> so you can calmly observe your thoughts. Use your power of thought to contemplate the rowdy gang that has come upon your mind, how one thought leads and flows into the next, and one jumps upon the other. Then suddenly a thought or memory from years ago comes to you, exactly like a mob of looters or a pack of stampeding beasts.
You will be amazed at the effectiveness of this method. At first it is dulled, and ever moment it gets weaker, until, just as we said, you feel as if you have swept your mind clean.
Having come thus far, we will now inform you about a perverse tendency in man to sometimes unknowingly get very excited about something small and shameful. We have hinted about this earlier, where sometimes after a particularly delicious meal, he doesn’t desire or think about things that he desired or thought about before eating. There are other such small, scornful things that have such a sway over man, so as to completely transform his thoughts and desires. Sometimes it gets to the point where a muddy smudge holds an entire man in its pocket. Then if you find the thing that holds such a power over you, and observe it carefully, you will similarly be able to take away its power.
We find sometimes that after a person eats he becomes stiff-necked and stone-hearted, stubborn and conceited. Furthermore, he is totally unaware that his eating caused him to be like this. In the same way a person sometimes gets depressed or enraged at even the smallest of matters, and has no idea why. In fact it turns out that at one time he had some mishap, whether over money or honor, and though the mishap is long forgotten but it still has the effect of depressing or enraging him. Sometimes a foolish worry can have the similar effect of depressing or angering him all day long. The advice is to try to remember the time when the obstinacy, or depression, or anger began, and what he was going through at that time. Did he eat something? Or was it the opposite, where he was unable to fulfill some desire or physical matter. When he looks into this tendency or inner defect and sees how it has twisted his thoughts and spirit, he gets weak, melts, and sometimes feels ashamed of himself that he let something so foolish affect him so strongly. He will know that he is truly successful if immediately upon being aware of the cause of his stubbornness, sadness, or anger, he feels a relief from these symptoms. At first glance his anger is quieted, his depression is lifted. He will truly feel as if a weight has been removed from his heart. [This is a law of the soul which cannot be explained at present.] It could be that he doesn’t feel immediate relief. He gropes around for the reason like a blind man, thinking maybe this caused his sadness, or perhaps it was this that bent him out of shape, but after searching his mind he is unable to identify the real cause. If this is the case, then he can be sure that he has not yet disclosed the cause that eclipsed his mood. At this time he feels the <i>hisragshus</i> of his soul crying within him, wailing at the pain inflicted by his low desires, thoughts, words, and actions, and harried by his dismal condition, as discussed above in chapter four. Since it is undressed <i>hisragshus</i> he is at a loss to identify it, and he ends up using it to fuel his feelings of sadness, abandonment, and anger.

Chapter 10

<big><strong>Summing up, and Seeing with the Soul</strong></big>
And now, Bachur, Avreich Chassid, before we say any more, and before we begin to get closer to the more sublime matters of Chassidus according to the level we have now reached, we will try summarize what has been said up to now. In every chapter and on every page we never asked you to do something that you where not able to do. We never asked you to mortify you flesh or fast. Even at times when, God forbid, your <i>yetser</i> vexed you with feelings of lust, we never told you to go and bang your head against the wall in order to erase it, as they (our forebears) would have readily done [if they were allowed to] even in response to permitted desires, rather than take the first step into the gates of hell. Rather, our entire discussion has coached you to proceed slowly and gradually, such as with the expansion of your thoughts in your study of Tanach, Midrashim, and Chassidus. At times when you are stimulated to <i>kedushah</i>, expand your <i>hisragshus</i> with thoughts and feelings of love and fear. And at times when you are spurned on by lusts, or even when overcome and confused by torrential thoughts, you have only to look at them in a way that will make you despise and scorn them, and they will cease. You can employ all of this advice calmly and peacefully,<sup class="footnote-marker">207</sup><i class="footnote">Here the Rebbe Zts”l wrote, “in and easy way.”</i> in a way that your soul will desire it and want to continue, like a good story that makes you want to hear more.
What results will you see if you only heed the advice provided in these chapters? First of all, your mind will no longer be an open house for every thought that wanders in. Instead, you will always be occupied with holy thoughts, when you wake up in the morning, when you lie down to sleep, and when you go about your day. Also, with God’s help, you will become a man of feeling. Your love and fear of God will not only be theoretical, but you will feel them and be stimulated by them. At your own initiation your soul will increase its ability to feel holy <i>hisragshus</i> of a much greater intensity that it could before. You will be able to choose the extent to which your own <i>hisragshus</i> is stimulated. Your thoughts will be purified and strengthened until even your body will seek its own sanctification. When your mind has been strengthened and accustomed to <i>avodah</i>, you will be able to make your first ventures into the sublime level of <i>avodah</i> of the Tsaddikim and Chassidim called the <i>avodah</i> of thought, albeit at a level suited to your abilities. But when we say that you will reach the level of <i>Chassid</i> and <i>Baal Nefesh</i>, bear in mind that it is only just touching that level. This is as we said at the outset that we only seek to follow on the heels of the holy masters, studying their footprints and learning from their ways.<sup class="footnote-marker">208</sup><i class="footnote">See Shir haShirim, 1:8, “go follow the tracks of the sheep.”</i> If we can do this, then their holy <i>sefarim</i> are open before us, to delve into their words and go in their way. Now that we are learning them with a revealed soul, we can see more than we ever did before. In general, when the soul is revealed even minimally, our vision is transformed, and we can see things in the Torah, both Written and Oral traditions, that we had never seen before. We can see things in <i>sefarim</i> of Kabbalah and Chassidus that we had never seen before. We can even see that which was hidden from us in this worldly existence, that which we had never seen or dreamed of before.
The Holy Baal Shem Tov teaches us that when you look at the world, then the Holy One, blessed be He, is looking at you, and you are looking at the Holy One, blessed be He. Every one of us reading these words would respond by saying that he is not capable of such sight, as clearly the Besht is not talking about looking at the world with the intellect, contemplating it, and then knowing that God created the world. This is not looking, but rather understanding. And not understanding God, but understanding the world. It could be that in his intellect he understands that God created the world, leads it, and even exists within it, but still God is hidden from the world and we don’t see Him. This man is only looking at the physical world. But the Holy Baal Shem Tov was talking about a higher kind of vision, where you can see even what is above the physical world. With this kind of vision, you are looking at the Holy One, blessed be He. Our holy masters had such a power of vision, yet we find it completely impossible.
But when we wring out the matter to its essence, we see that even in our low state we are not so far from employing a form of this exalted vision from where we stand in the world. When we ask ourselves, “what is the world?” it is clear that we are not only incapable of seeing beyond the world, but we aren’t even seeing this world that is before our eyes, save the tip of the iceberg. In <b>A Student’s Obligation</b> we discussed how at the end of the summer, an insect will hide it’s eggs in a place safe from the cold of the winter, so by next summer, when nothing of the insect remains, it’s eggs will hatch a new generation of insects of the same species. Is the insect even aware of what he is doing? He doesn’t even know that the winter is coming and that it will be followed by spring! We said that every animal and every insect does this in its own way. But considering how each bug does such wonderful, masterful work with such a greatly limited brain, we wonder how it knows what to do. We must conclude that this is a product of the Godly life force in a greater measure and a greater portion than an animal is capable of perceiving. It is the Godly life force expressed by the verse, “You have made them all with wisdom.” And with such a great portion of the Godly life force and wisdom, it manages to do things far too wondrous for man and his level of wisdom. It is not easy for man to understand even the biology of the human body and the workings of his internal organs, and all the more so that he doesn’t activate them according to his will – they all work together wondrously on their own without his knowledge or understanding. Who does all of these, and who causes this to be? The vital soul within man causes all of this to work without his knowledge or agreement.
Anyone possessing knowledge will understand that the living souls of animals and men, whose growth and actions, so wondrous, are indeed the acts of God in the world, are not in revealed contact with God and consciously following His command, because an insect cannot understand a command, even man’s stomach doesn’t understand instructions. That is to say, there is the Godly portion of a living soul in every living being, from the smallest to the greatest. It is found in every sinew and every cell. And that Godly portion is the wondrous source that maintains the life of every living being, something that man’s mind cannot comprehend. And when we human beings look at simpler life forms, all we see are entities devoid of consciousness and a more limited life essence.
When we look at a plant, the simplest creature that we consider to be alive, we don’t see its essence. For example, when you add compost around a plant, it grows, it blooms and thrives. Then, when an animal comes along and eats the plant, the animal grows, adding flesh and bone. Then when a man eats the animal, the man also grows, even fattens. We see that if it were not for the compost the plant would be lacking, for it wouldn’t have been thick but frail, and if it were not for the plant the animal would have been lacking, and if were not for the plant and the animal, the man would be lacking. That is to say that something from the compost transformed and became a part of the plant, and then the plant transformed in order to become part and parcel of the bone and the flesh of the animal, and afterward of the man. And now we may ask, what is the essence of this thing that keeps transforming from time to time, and what is the essence of everything in the world? Don’t we see that from the time the animal was born to the time it grew to its full size there was never a part of the animal that was composed of plants? It completely transformed into the actual flesh, blood, and bones of the animal, and then afterward of the man. So what is it’s essence? There are those clever people who will answer that from the outset the plant just drew the essential nutrients it needed from the compost, and then afterward the stomach of the animal did the same as the plant did, drawing essential nutrients from the plants, etc.
Please, don’t offer us such a childish solution, because even if each one only took the nutrients it needed for itself, as we see that each one doesn’t need it’s own unique nutrients but rather one takes more of x and less of y, and the other taking less of x and more of y. All of them take basically the same nutrients, and draw the same nutrients into their systems. If so, then why is it that when the plant takes these nutrients, they all transform completely into plant, in appearance, form, and nature, and when they enter the animal they turn into flesh? And if you answer that it is the plant and the animal that is doing this transformation, we will in turn ask who exactly is this plant who is so diligent in his work and wondrous artistry that he can take every element that is draws out of its surroundings and use this part for the roots, another part for the stalks and branches, and another part for the leaves so it can breath the air and soak in the sun which is all outside of the earth? And who is this stomach and this intestines, these masterful engineers who work so hard and efficiently as to draw the nutrients out of each food and allocate it throughout the body, this part to the brain, that part to the heart, that part to the nerves and bones, each one getting just what it needs? Why is it that if the plant has dried out or the animal is damaged it can no longer take nourishment? And then when the plant, animal, or man dies its body separates back into disparate elements and transforms to the point where nothing of its essence remains, so it could never be identified as once having been a plant or an animal. If so, who could deceive himself into thinking that it is the very essence of the plant, animal, or body of man that has the power to transform different elements that it digests into its very body in form and function. And conversely, one could defy the biological engineers to take pure elements and fashion them into a plant or animal, etc.
What essentially is the plant, the stomach, the world? It is a portion of the Divine illumination<sup class="footnote-marker">209</sup><i class="footnote">(The original text adds:) An illumination is what shines from the essence of the light. For example, the sun itself is called the luminary as well as the light, but on the earth we only perceive an illumination shining from it.</i> that God contracted and used to create the world in all of its branches, divisions, and details. God, may He be blessed, is higher that all of the worlds, but in his simple will shined an illumination from His light and power. He then constricted a part of this illumination and formed it into the worlds. Holy <i>sefarim</i> teach us that the Hebrew word for nature, “<i>hatevah</i>,” is the exact numerical equivalent of the name of God, “E-lohim.”<sup class="footnote-marker">210</sup><i class="footnote">In adding up the letters of “hateva,” and “E-lohim,” they will both equal 86.</i> That is to say, God concatenated and expanded an illumination from the name, “E-lohim,” and turned it into the world. The root of Israel is in the Tetragrammaton (Y”HVH), whose Godly aspect is above the world, for, “a portion of God is His people.”<sup class="footnote-marker">211</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim, 32.</i> God separated a portion of this Godly illumination and used it to create the plant and its essential life force, and it is that portion that gathers together the nutrients in order to give life to the plant. Then when the animal eats it, the portion of the Godly illumination in the plant is elevated and added to the vital life force of the animal. And since the very essence, whether it is within the plant, the animal, or in man, is the same essential Godly force, only differing in greater or lesser intensity and on a higher or lower level, therefore when it ascends from the plant to the animal, it doesn’t look like a foreign substance that is being added to it, but as one thing that makes them both. It is the part of the plant that transformed into the stomach of the animal or the man which works so diligently to transform each element and nutrient into a part of the animal or the man.
David HaMelech already hinted at this when he said, “In ancient days, the earth did You establish, and the work of Your hands are the heavens. They may perish, but You will endure, and all of them will wear out like a garment, like a cloak will You change them and they will pass on.”<sup class="footnote-marker">212</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim, 102:26</i> If every species in the world were a separate entity unto itself, then it would be impossible for anything to change from one form into another, but each one would be like a separate garment for the Godly illumination, and they would only be able to change form by removing the garment and dressing in a different one. The Godly illumination would first dress in the garment of the plant, then remove it and dress in the garment of the animal, and then in the garment of the man.
It is not only above this world that the Godly illumination is the principle of everything and the essence of everything that exists, but also in this world. The Liqutei Torah of the Rav<sup class="footnote-marker">213</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Parshat Ci Tavo.</i> tells us, “God is not E-l HaOlam – the God of the world (with the definite article), but E-l Olam (without the definite article), because the world is not separate from God, but rather the promulgation of God’s illumination, and a shining of the divine light.” In other words, E-l HaOlam (with the definite article) would mean that the world is a separate entity, it is just that God is the God of the world, whereas E-l Olam means that the world is not separate, but a Godly illumination drawn from the Source. So for every person who has not delivered his being over to his lusts, who has not distorted his healthy mind in a tangle of folly and gone so far as to call that folly wisdom in order to permit himself anything that his evil spirit desires, will find it evident that both in the world at large, and in every detail of the world, the portion of Godliness is the essence of everything and the inner point which is not exchanged and does not change. The rest of the world, that is, the part which changes and is exchanged, is just a garment, but not a separate garment like man’s clothing. Rather it is the externality of the essence and the Godly portion. The holy sefarim describe it as a “locust whose garment is a part of its body,”<sup class="footnote-marker">214</sup><i class="footnote">Jastrow renders <i>kamtsa</i> as, “a snail,” (but it could be any creature with an exoskeleton) and cites the souce in the Midrash, Yalkut Bereshit, 34. This image is a central motif in the writings of the Ari <i>z”l</i> and the Chassidic masters.</i> meaning that its garment is the very externality of its body, growing together with its body.
It is important to bear in mind that the body is not the main point, it is just that we don’t see the soul, but we see and feel the entire body, and for this reason our question is not yet answered. We are not only trying to identify the true nature of that which is hidden from our eyes and our other senses, but we are looking at the very body, that we sense and feel, wanting to know the true nature of its essence, and we find ourselves unable to identify it. How is it that it changes from substance to substance? How is it that the lump that was yesterday a plant, in form, taste, and nature, that was so diligent in drawing the elements from its surroundings and turning them into plant matter, has now changed into a piece of the animal’s stomach, and tomorrow will be the stomach or hand of a man, continuing to work with such diligence in maintaining the current form just as it did the previous form? The Eyts Chaiim,<sup class="footnote-marker">215</sup><i class="footnote">Of Rav Yitchak Luria (1534-1572), Eytz Chaiim, Sha’ar 42, ch. 1.</i> quotes the Ramban’s comment on Bereshit, (1:2), “and the earth was chaos (<i>tohu</i>) and void,” which identifies the substance of the chaos as <i>hiyuli</i>, or a nebulous energy that is ready to assume different possible forms. The Ari <i>z”l</i> tells us that the <i>hiyuli</i> is on the level of Keter (the Crown). In other words, the essential energy that takes form in the world is the aspect of Divinity called Keter (Crown) which has no form on its own, but rather assumes the form of the root elements and their composites in the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">216</sup><i class="footnote">(The original text adds:) The Ramban does not understand the <i>hiyuli</i> as did his predecessors. They understood the substance of the <i>hiyuli</i> simply, where God created a physical substance in the world which happens to be lacking in form. Something like this can only be imagined but cannot exist in the same way outside of our minds. This is because a physical substance cannot exist without a form. This is because form is a variable which identifies the matter as well as its nature. For example, the form of snow defines its own characteristics (its whiteness – meaning its form, its softness and coldness, meaning its nature) and separates it from everything else in the world. And the form of fire is its redness, its heat, etc. The form of a house is its shape and structure, and its material is bricks. But the bricks, when they were on their own before they had been built into a house, or after they were taken from it, also have a form by which they are identified as bricks and which distinguishes them from everything else, such as their dimensions and their material, which is clay. The clay also has its own form before it is made into bricks, the form of clay. Even the seed when it is planted in the soil, appears at the time it disintegrates to be formless material, but then too it also has a form, which is its own particular description and nature. It is distinguished from any other disintegrated matter in that it is ready to sprout into a plant. Even while disintegrated, it is distinguished from any other disintegrated seed in the particular kind of plant that it will become, and none other. This is all in order to illustrate that a pure substance without form is something that cannot exist outside of the mind. The idea of hiyuli without any form whatsoever is possible in Divinity but not in the material world. That is why the Eyts Chaiim mentioned above calls it the aspect of Keter – Crown, which is a Godly illumination that God drew into the world before He dressed it in any form. It is the root essence of everything in the world and changes only in the garments that dress it. The idea of dressing form needs to be explained more, but not in the current book.</i>
We need to believe, even to actually see, that no physical root essence exists unto itself, but rather the root essence of everything is a portion of Godliness. The physical garment is not foreign to the essence, and also not Godly, but rather like a man’s fingernails, which seem to be foreign to the body and not foreign at the same time, as they grow from within man’s body, like the locust whose shell grows together with the rest of its body. So now we can understand how we are not only unable to see the inner essence of the soul, but we are not even seeing the inner essence of the body and the materials of which it is comprised, because the materials have no essence unto themselves, but rather their essence is a Godly portion that we do not see or feel.
In A Student’s Obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">217</sup><i class="footnote">First article, section two.</i> we discussed how the Baal Shem Tov reached into the verse, “the entirety of the world is His glory,” and revealed that not only does a Divine spark exist in the inner aspect of everything in the world, but even the physical world itself, the coarse body clothing this spark, is also an illumination of Godliness, since God created it <i>ex nihilo</i>, purely out of the illumination of His Divinity. Our intention now is to add to his words using our limited abilities. We are not on the level of the Holy Baal Shem Tov who actually saw eye to eye how the physical garments of the world are an Godly illumination and a product of Divine names, but still, according to our human understanding we too are able to see, if we only look closely and meditate, that Hashem is E-lohim in the heavens above and on the earth below, there is no other. It is not just that there is no God other than Hashem, may He be blessed, but also that nothing exists in the world save God’s light and illumination, for the essence of everything physical in the world is none other than the illumination of his blessed Divinity.
There is much more to say about this. But concerning only what has just been said, if the intelligent mind tries to envision the world without this essence, even if he believes that God exists above, created the world and even effuses His life force into it, in general and in particular, but in his mind he doesn’t see that the Divine essence exists within every detail of the world that we see and feel, and everything save this essence is only a garment, but not like a foreign garment but a garment that grows out of the inside, like a shadow cast by the essence, and like colors and hues that the root of the world and the Divine essence uses to paint and thereby be seen, then the world will remain nothing more than shadows without a source and colors with nothing to bear their color. God alone exists, and there is none besides Him.
So why is it that we only see the colors, and without deep contemplation we would only see the outer garments and the inner essence that is right here before us would remain unseen? It is simply because the sin of Adam haRishon and the sin of every individual since then has made our perception coarse and material. For this reason we only see the material. This idea has been explained by many holy masters. But you could ask why man does not realize the deficiency of his perception of the world? That is to say, if we are using the coarse and physical quality of our perception and understanding in order to view the world and the conclusion is that that the material world had an essence unto itself, then it would be easy to understand why we don’t realize the deficiency on our own,<sup class="footnote-marker">218</sup><i class="footnote">We would simply be blind to it based on the defect in our perception.</i> and why man’s perception and contemplation doesn’t cause him to try to identify the true essence of the things of the world. A mind distorted by perceiving only the external or the physical doesn’t stop to ask what is sustaining all of these colors, because it naturally concludes that the world in its essence is indeed material. But now that we have proven that our materialized senses and knowledge don’t see any tangible or material essence in the world, then why doesn’t it register that there is something missing in our perception? Why is man’s mind satisfied with the shadow, and on his own he doesn’t seek to know what is casting the shadow?
The answer to this question lies in what was discussed in chapter two, on how we only know about the world based on the information received through the five senses, and without them we would not know it. It is because the senses only perceive the outer form of things that lends itself to perception, for how else would we know that the thing we see is a tree, if not by virtue of the growth of its form, into its trunk and branches, etc., which all allow our eyes to perceive it as a tree, whereas our senses still do not perceive the essence of the tree. Even if we cut into it, all we see its form and color. It is just that at first we saw the form of a tree, and now all we see is split branches and sawed pieces of tree trunk. When we see its form and color we know that it is split wood. For this reason, if someone took another material whose color and form resembled wood or split branches, we would be mistaken into thinking that it is a tree or wood. It is similar with the sense of touch, taste, and smell. With all of them, we only perceive its external element, or something that it emits, but not the essence. Therefore, since from infancy we are habituated into a way of perception, and all of that perception together with our will to know the world around us is based on seeking the knowledge of colors, shapes, and forms, we never learned how to seek the knowledge of the essence. Because of this habituation we don’t even begin to think that there is anything missing from our perception, and our minds don’t hit upon it like a conundrum that is begging for the solution.
We don’t place the blame solely on the senses, saying that it is only the senses that see nothing more than the outside of the world, seeking only the knowledge of external appearances, but not the essence. In the final analysis, the senses are only the agents of the man, who perceives the world through them and uses them to know all he deems important to know. There is much more to say about the way in which the senses united with the world and the knowledge that is gleaned from this union. But for the sake of brevity we will only say that since the animal portion of man, meaning the portion of the external aspect of the world, is the first part to develop, and is the first part within man to come into contact with the world in order to survive and protect himself accordingly by eating, drinking, and so forth.<sup class="footnote-marker">219</sup><i class="footnote">also shelter, hygiene, and avoiding bodily harm</i> So in his preoccupation with securing these ends, which are all included the exterior aspect of the world, man becomes accustomed to operating in the shadows. From childhood his senses have been trained not to sense, nor even to ask or investigate what exists further than these external garments.
It has reached a level of absurdity. If a man simply raises the issue, saying, “You have such a beautiful world, and you are so immersed in it and delighted with it. But really, where is this world of yours? Aren’t you really just whiling away your life in the shadows and the colors?” he will be laughed at for asking such a ridiculous question. But the absurdity does not end there. In order to smear away any impression this sobering question may have on the man whose heart is so dedicated to pleasure seeking, there are many who have invented baseless, twisted theories in order to justify their weltanschauung, where the more he succeeds in twisting and confusing his knowledge, the more he is praised as a genius. It may be compared to teaching person who was born deaf and blind about sounds and colors. Not only will he not believe, but he will get angry at what he views as an attempt to place what he views as false notions in his mind. He will not even entertain the possibility that they really do exist, and that the deficiency rests with him since his body doesn’t have the ability to sense them.
Yet when a good hearted fellow whose mind is not totally immersed in debauchery begins to rouse that portion of essence within him, namely his <i>nefesh</i> and his knowledge, to <i>avodas Hashem</i>, and through deep contemplation he makes contact with the essence of the outside world, he will see that up to this point everything that he always saw, felt, rejoiced, and delighted in the world was really lacking any contact with the essence. It is like a person who just wakes up from a deep sleep, where he doesn’t just know that all the things he saw and felt were only dreams, but his eyes, ears, and all of his senses tell him that everything that was so real only a moment ago actually has no basis in reality. What is the essence of the world? It is the Master of the world. “You shall realize [it] today and impress [it] upon your heart, that it is the Eternal who is God in Heaven above and on the earth below, there is none other.” There is no existence except God, and everything is an illumination of His <i>kedushah</i>.
And You, <i>E-l Mistater</i>, God who hides Himself, why is it that I look upon You all day long, but I do not see You? And though I touch the majesty of Your illumination with my hand, I do not know You. How wondrous are Your acts, God who does the wondrous!
When, with God’s help, we are worthy of doing the <i>avodah</i> of Chassidus, and allow a slight revelation of our souls, then in states of elevated consciousness, when our souls burn beyond the constrictions or our shadows and the confines of our bodies, it will be possible at times to see the majestic brilliant, shining light of the world flash before us. We will not just know through the mind’s meditations, nor will we only know and see what is lacking in our perception, namely knowing that our material existence is like a baseless shadow. Yet we will actually see through the eyes of your soul, on the level of, “peering through the cracks,”<sup class="footnote-marker">220</sup><i class="footnote">Shir HaShirim, 2:9 Like looking through slight cracks in a wall, we may be privileged to see the Divine essence that is largely concealed by the wall of the physical world and the senses.</i> seeing both the Divine essence and the source of the shadow. According to my limited human understanding, we will not be able to intellectually identify what it was that flashed before us, because such is the nature of the limitations of the human intellect, and can only understand mortal and finite matters. But we will know with the soul, and we will be sure that we glimpsed the shining of the world cast from the illumination that the Master of the world.
Bachur, Avreich Chassid! Don’t look at this as an impossible task, especially since it is clear that you already have some of the ability. Sometimes after two hours of intense Torah study uninterrupted by idle talk or concern for light matters, where you have been separate from the bog of the world and totally immersed in Torah and Chassidus - and furthermore, you enjoyed it - you find that when you pause from your study and get up to take care of physical necessities, you feel dissatisfied with the world, even abhorring it. Why are you dissatisfied with the world at this time? This is also the same matter that we spoke of before. Your feelings are folded within you, and you don’t even know what they are.
Therefore, expand your thoughts. Do you abhor the world per se? No, because if you could you would be sitting in the company of you fellow Chassidim, drinking strong drink and discussing matters of Torah, Chassidus, and avodas Hashem. You would be quite happy then, and isn’t the strong drink a thing of the world? Then, when you go out and look at people in the street, running to work, running to their shops, busily engaged in the affairs of the world, as if running after a livelihood was the reason they were born and their sole purpose on this earth, you become afraid, thinking that you too could one day become one of these fools. Then if you could, you would shout at them, and at yourself, shouting, “Fools! What do you want from the world? Isn’t the earth Hashem’s and the fullness thereof?” Look inside yourself and this is what you will see. Then it becomes clear to you that you do not abhor the world. It is only the way people perceive the world that you abhor, and the way they use it that stirs your disgust.
These kinds of feelings are proof of what was said about you above. You are not so different from these people running to and fro. You see the heavens and the earth, and all the things of the world. But now your soul has gained extra strength from your Torah study and your concentration on Chassidus. It has overpowered your senses, and your senses perceived the world, but it was not in the same way that the others perceived the world. They look at the world as a huge barn to house animals and people, and you see how the earth is Hashem’s and the fullness thereof. Men, animals, food, all the matters of the body - they are all consecrated to holy <i>avodah</i>. You did not come to this knowledge through an intellectual investigation. Rather you know this deep inside of you in the depths of your soul. Pure knowledge flashed within you, and you saw with higher vision. So why should such a goal seem so far away when all you have to do is continue to allow your soul to burst forth, and reveal itself with greater and greater intensity. Then at that time, your eyes will behold a flash of brilliant light. You will glimpse how the world shines from the majestic illumination. You will stand and sing out to God, and all of them, the heavens and the earth and all of the trees will all answer you. You will tremble and delight.
We are not capable of apprehending the Divine illumination witnessed by the holy masters. Yet we too, when we only just begin to become Chassidim, <i>baalei nefesh</i> – masters of the soul, will open our eyes and hearts and see in the world what we were hitherto unable to see. Then a new heaven will be revealed to us even in the Torah, works of Kabbalah, and Chassidus. And now that the gates of heaven have opened before you, who is going to stop you?

Chapter 11

<big><strong>The Fellowship</strong></big>
It is written in the Gemara,<sup class="footnote-marker">221</sup><i class="footnote">Berachos, 63b Soncino translation.</i> “The word ‘<i>haskes’</i> (‘Take heed,’ as used in Devarim 27:9) means; take heed to form groups for Torah study, for the Torah is only acquired through association with others.” And it is not only with Torah study. Whenever our holy forebears wanted to reach a higher level of <i>avodah</i>, asceticism, or <i>kedushah</i>, they would do it in groups. In Hebrew, <i>chaver</i> (<i>chaverim</i>, pl.) means friend. The bonds of friendship were so fundamental to the ethos of the sages that not only members of a fellowship were called by the name <i>chaver</i>, but even the wife and daughter of a member of the fellowship were called <i>eyshes chaver</i> (wife of the friend) or <i>bas chaver</i> (daughter of the friend). The holy disciples of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, the masters of the Zohar, who dedicated themselves to yet a higher <i>avodah</i> referred to themselves as the, “<i>chevraya</i>,’ the fellowship, as is mentioned many times in the Zohar, while the great masters of Chassidus followed suit in more recent times. Aside from the fact that Chassidus and the Chassidim are really one group unto themselves, still, there was an inner echelon made up of the most refined among them, called the <i>b’nei aliya</i>, who possessed powers of spiritual ascent, joined together in a special association. Their greatness and additional <i>kedushah</i> brought them closer to their Rebbe, seeking more and drawing more living waters from the source of the Rebbe’s Torah than the rest of the Chassidim. The more intensive connection to the Rebbe enjoyed by the elite served the community at large by better preparing them to give over their Rebbe’s teachings. Most of the members of the elite fellowships later became teachers in their own right and leaders of their generation.
And now, since our desire is to follow on the heels of our holy masters and learn from their ways, we need to re-establish the <i>chevraya</i>. We find it written in the epistles at the end of the Noam Elimelech that when man travels to his Rebbe and cleaves to him, then he has only to simply lead his life in the service of Hashem in order to be considered a Chassid through the power of his Rebbe, even if he personally has not reached the level of a Chassid. The verse, “and they believed in Hashem and Moshe His servant,”<sup class="footnote-marker">222</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos, 14:31</i> tells us that by means of the simple faith of the children of Israel and their connection to Moshe, it was as if they had ascended to a level of holiness that they alone were not worthy of attaining. It was not only the elite <i>b’nei aliya</i> who traveled to the Rebbes, but also the simple Chassidim, the <i>ba’alei batttim</i> and working men. But my dear <i>Bachurim</i>, <i>Avreichim Chassidim</i>, why be satisfied with being among the simple Chassidim and not among the elite?
Why should you be satisfied with being counted among the ones who are asked, “what is Chassidus,” and, “what is the difference between a Chassid and a God fearing Jew who is not a Chassid, or between a Chassid who is a Torah scholar and a Torah scholar who is not a Chassid,” and haven’t the faintest idea how to answer? Or they give the pat answer of, “Chassidus is an <i>avodah</i> of great warmth,” not stopping to consider that the holy Kabbalists, the Ari <i>z”l</i> and his students, Seraphim of God, certainly were not lacking in Godly fire in their <i>avodah</i>. And if you say that the intense fire of the Kabbalists had died down, and the Baal Shem Tov came to rekindle it again, and therefore (God forbid) the Baal Shem Tov didn’t reveal anything new, but only returned the crown to its former glory. If so, then why do we use the new names of Chassidim and Chassidus, and not Kabbalists and Kabbalah as before? And what was the reason for the opposition of the <i>misnagdim</i>, the opponents of Chassidus, if all the Chassidim wanted to do was re-establish the <i>avodah</i> of the Kabbalists?
And now we have arrived at the main point. When Chassidim are found in the world who posses understanding and perform the avodah of Chassidus, that is to say, at a time when the holy light and <i>avodah</i> of Chassidus has descended into the world in different places, then we have a special situation where <i>ba’alei battim</i> and simple Jews travel to their Rebbe to draw from his light and <i>kedushah</i>, and are called by the name, “Chassidim.” This is akin to the kedushah of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem, where a simple Jew, a farmer on the other side of the land of Israel, working his field with his scythe and plow, would draw from the <i>kedushah</i> that was revealed in the Holy Temple. This only happens when you do have Chassidim who truly understand the <i>avodah</i> and perform it, but certainly not when no one, neither the Torah scholars or the unlearned, neither performs it nor even knows about it. So in such a situation, how could they all be called Chassidim? Certainly not just because they travel to their Rebbe!<sup class="footnote-marker">223</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning, it’s not enough that a Tsaddik exists in the world who knows how to serve God. He needs Chassidim who do the <i>avodah</i>.</i> Did the situation of Chassidus somehow change in our generation, or did a new form of Chassidus appear, where in former times we needed Chassidim who understood and performed the <i>avodah</i>, but now no one needs to do or even understand it, God forbid, and still be considered Chassidim? Such Chassidim with an elite <i>chevraya</i> at its head is of no benefit to their Rebbe, to the contrary, if he didn’t have them he would not be missing anything. “Rabbi Chanina said, I have learned much Torah from my Rabbis, and even more from my friends, but from my students I have learned most of all.”<sup class="footnote-marker">224</sup><i class="footnote">Ta’anis, 7a</i> Students are such a benefit to their Rav, and of their absence, God forbid, it says, “And God spoke to Moshe, saying, ‘Go down.’ Rabbi Eliezar said, ‘God said to Moshe, descend from your level of greatness, because the only reason I gave you greatness was for the sake of Israel.’ ”
The <i>chevraya</i> is a crucial element for <i>avodah</i> in general and Chassidus in particular. The <b>Maor VaShemesh</b> tells us,<sup class="footnote-marker">225</sup><i class="footnote">Parshas Ci Setze</i> “We have seen how in earlier generations, before the dawn of Baal Shem Tov and his way cast its light in the world … every man who had the fear of God in his heart … would seclude himself, away from society or fellowship … some would suffer prolonged fasts and endure mortification of the flesh … of course God wants mans heart, and whenever man’s intention is solely for the sake of God, it is good before God, and yet, this is not the main path in <i>avodas Hashem</i>. The main path, and the foundation stone of all <i>teshuvah</i> is found in the practice of loving friends, close connection with friends, and close connection to the Tsaddik of the generation … a person may feel that his heart is more aroused to return to God’s path in the way of <i>teshuvah</i>, and to cleave to God when he puts himself in seclusion than when he in the company of his beloved friends and ‘listening companions,’<sup class="footnote-marker">226</sup><i class="footnote">See Shir HaShirim, 8:13</i> because the company of men causes him to loose his feeling of close connection to God, but regardless of this, it is much more important to strengthen his connection to his friends and his fellowship … for by means of this he has the strength to draw the Divine illumination for the length of his life … and in seclusion he can only sustain it for a short period of time.” So even though our holy forebears would fast and suffer all manner of asceticism in seclusion in order to achieve the intense feeling of connection to God called <i>deveikus</i>, we learn here from the <b>Maor VaShemesh</b> that an <i>avodah</i> together with the fellowship is superior, as its good effects last longer. And now, in our generation, when we no longer have such practices as meditative seclusion and asceticism, the <i>chevraya</i> is even more crucial, both for <i>avodah</i> in general and Chassidus in particular.
In light of this, I suggest that you get together in groups, making a holy <i>chevraya</i> dedicated to Chassidus.
And if you ask, “why should we seek such lofty heights by creating a holy and elite <i>chevraya</i>? Suffice for us to be like the average Chassidim of bygone years, for certainly they understood Chassidus and <i>avodas Hashem</i>.”
But truly, we are not asking for more. As we said at the outset, all we seek is the privilege of following on the heels of the average Chassidim, kicking up the dust of their footprints. Does it occur to you that we seek to ascend to the level of the <i>chevraya</i> of the Baal Shem Tov, of the Great Maggid, of the holy men like my ancestor Rebbe Elimelech of Lyzhensk and his brother Rebbe Zushia? Like the Baal HaTanya, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi, or like the Kozhnitser Maggid? Our desire and our prayer is only to follow on the heels of the Chassidim of bygone years. But since the Gemara, as well as the masters of the Zohar and Chassidus view the forming of fellowships as not just an excellent way to advance in <i>avodah</i> and Torah, but even one of its fundamental principles, therefore we say this together with our other advice. In this way you will be able to follow in the path of the holy masters, and in doing so be somewhat worthy of being called Chassidim. Therefore, join together in a holy <i>chevraya</i>.
But we must make it clear to you, that if you indeed go through the struggle, and you really do merit the understanding and the <i>avodah</i> of Chassidus according to your level, then, measured against the level of this generation, you will truly be a holy <i>chevraya</i>.
Don’t form a huge fellowship, including all of the young men and Avreichim from all of the surrounding towns in your area. Rather, do it as our holy forbears did. Form a holy fellowship out of all the young men and <i>Avreichim</i>, especially those who are still financially dependant on their fathers, who possess the will and fortitude to dedicate themselves to the acquiring the knowledge and <i>avodah</i> of Chassidus, and who are all connected to the same Rebbe.
The members of the <i>chevraya</i> should not be involved in any of the matters of the city. That is to say, they can join in any of the activities or organizations that other observant Jews are involved in as private individuals, but not for the purposes of the <i>chevraya</i> or as its representatives. Don’t require any members of the <i>chevraya</i> to be supported by a patron in the community, because such a requirement only breeds a desire for honor and victory. The chevraya needs to be clean of these problems. And if anyone tells you that modern times requires a man to join an organization for the purpose of garnering financial support,<sup class="footnote-marker">227</sup><i class="footnote">He could be referring to both issues of joining organizations and finding financial support.</i> then answer him that may be necessary for us as human beings at this time, and we will join together with all God-fearing Jews, but we will not join together as members of the <i>chevraya</i>. This is because the holy <i>chevraya</i> is above time, and worldly concerns. At times when we get together as members of the <i>chevraya</i>, or at times when each member goes into deep meditation according to the ways of the association, then we are in fact outside of the world, and far from its conventions and aspirations. At that time we are under the illumination of the Baal Shem Tov and the Tsaddikim who followed him.
A member of the chevraya could concurrently be a member of another fellowship whose membership includes “servants of God who tremble at His word,”<sup class="footnote-marker">228</sup><i class="footnote">See Shemos, 19:16, Yeshayahu, 68:5, the sources in the Tanach for the term “Haredim.”</i> but only as private individuals and not in the capacity as representatives of the <i>chevraya</i>.
As was mentioned, all <i>Avreichim</i> and <i>Bachurim</i> who are connected to the same Rebbe and are willing to actively dedicate themselves to the path of Chassidus should form a <i>chevraya</i>. Members of the same <i>chevraya</i> living in the same town should form a close knot group to serve Hashem together in the path of Chassidus. And if all of the <i>Avreichim</i> and <i>Bachurim</i> from different Chassidic courts wish to join together, they may do so, if their paths of Chassidus are compatible.
If they pray in the same <i>shteibel</i>, the first - (the members of a <i>chevraya</i>) should not leave it, in order to not destroy the <i>shteibel</i> from lack of attendance, as the <i>sheteibel</i> is the fortress of Chassidus and Torah in our generation, and second – in order not to separate and distance themselves from other Chassidim. On the contrary, the more the fellowship ascends in their holy <i>avodah</i>, the more they need to strengthen their ties with all of the servants of God in Israel in general and with the Chassidim in particular.
Do not appoint a chairman or a secretary. If you ask, “who will assemble them together, and who will lead them?” then look up, and ask yourself, “who gathered and let the Chassidim and the holy fellowships of years past?” The Chassidus and the spirit of <i>kedushah</i> gathered them and led them. When an individual doesn’t come of his own accord, comes heartlessly, is consistently late, or comes only so the others can see that he showed up, it is counterproductive to have the chairman or the secretary call him, for he is only spoiling the <i>chevraya</i>. Every member is obligated to encourage his fellows, but only as friends and equals, and not as a superior. There shall be no awarding of special promotions or honors among the <i>chevraya</i>, only, “exalt her (the Torah), and she shall promote you, when you embrace her, she shall honor you.”<sup class="footnote-marker">229</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei. 4:8</i> Whoever truly excels and ascends in Torah and <i>avodas Hashem</i> will naturally be honored above the rest.
No matter how much we need to work to bring all Jews closer to Torah, <i>avodah</i>, and Chassidus these days, still, do not try to bring new members into the <i>chevraya</i> who are not worthy but only to show that you have a lot of friends, for as mentioned, sometimes these kinds of friends only spoil the fellowship.
The <i>chevraya</i> will only accept members who are <i>bnei Torah</i> (dedicated to Torah study), regardless of whether their knowledge is great or small.
The <i>chevraya</i> will not accept the fickle minded and inconsistent, lest he joins today on a whim, and in his inconsistency, abandons and tramples it tomorrow, “turning over and spilling out the pot.”
The <i>chevraya</i> accepts only those who are not liars or deceitful by nature. Sometimes you find a person whose <i>yetser</i> inspires him to lie, God forbid, even if it is only on occasion. If it is indeed is has only been intermittent un-truths, then he may repent and join the fellowship. But if someone is a veteran liar and cheat, lying to himself as well as others, he may not join. Regarding such a person, I heard from my father in law, the holy Rav, who said in the name of another Tsaddik, that <i>teshuvah</i> is of no use for the veteran liar, since he is even lying about his own <i>teshuvah</i>. Since he lies to himself, he can deceive himself into thinking that he actually is doing <i>teshuvah</i>, when in fact he has not been reformed from his former behavior whatsoever.
No member of the <i>chevraya</i> should regard himself as a low person, like an animal, whose nature is to engage in ungainly behavior. Rather he should look at himself in the way hinted at by Chazal, “a man should always consider himself as if the Holy One resides within him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">230</sup><i class="footnote">Ta’anis, 11b</i> That is to say, he is a man lifted up to a high level. He should forbid himself from partaking in that which others permit themselves. He should not only think on whether his thoughts, speech, and actions are good, for it could be that they are good for another person but not for him. Rather he should consider only whether they are good according to his own elevated level. Not that he should consider himself superior and become arrogant, God forbid. To the contrary, he should simply regard himself a man who years for Holy One of Israel, dedicated to purifying himself and to the <i>kedushah</i> of God’s holy <i>avodah</i>. He will humble himself before all men of Israel, breaking his heart within him, saying, “considering my level and the extent to which I have sanctified myself, all of my actions are really improper, and who knows how much more damage I do with my thoughts, speech, and actions than others do with theirs, all because I have sanctified myself to heaven!” At this point he shall strengthen himself and strive to be better.
He shall regard each member of the <i>chevraya</i> as a <i>ben aliya</i> – a sublime Kabbalist, respecting him and honoring him, for truly his soul is rooted in the sons of the prophets. Furthermore, he has sacrificed himself to <i>kedushah</i> in order to allow the Shechinah to rest upon him.
Besides learning with other members of the <i>chevraya</i>, the members must gather together at least once a day in the <i>shteibel</i> or in a private home in order to learn Chassidus.
When they get together, they should not engage in idle speech. Rather, each one may learn what he wants to learn – this one Gemara, this one Mishha, etc. Still, they should schedule a <i>shiur</i> (lesson) that they all attend together (either once or twice a week as decided by a majority of the members) on the topic of guidance and Chassidus. Pamphlets like this one should be learned together if the <i>chevraya</i> feels that such pamphlets are helpful.
When they get together to learn matters of guidance, they shouldn’t go through it as if they were reading a story, but rather they should be comfortable with taking the time necessary to properly learn <i>b’iyun</i> (in an in-depth manner). As a group and as individuals they should apply the direction and guidance gained from their study, thinking about how to fix it within them. In doing so, various matters in the <i>sefer</i> will become clear to them. If a good idea comes to any member of the <i>chevraya</i>, whether at a time when he is together with the group or alone, in the street, etc., he should tell it to his friends, and they should listen to him, for even if every nine times his idea is of no value, the tenth time his idea could be of real value. The Zohar tells us that sometimes you find a pearl among the pickings of a poor man. As we said earlier, every good thought on the subject of <i>avodah</i> that is conceived in the heart and mind of the Israelite is an echo of the soul’s voice, whether it is the sound of the soul crying as it falls or laughing as it ascends. But make sure that the members of the <i>chevraya</i> are not only throwing out their ideas in order to kill time or show off their intelligence.
It is a good idea for them to all get together for a drink once in a while, not in order to get drunk and disorderly, God forbid, but in the way of the Chassidim to bond together and to rouse the animal soul out of its slovenliness (as mentioned in chapter eight). Even someone whose constitution does not allow him to drink liquor should dilute it with water and drink together with the fellowship.
After the drink, they should sing a <i>zemer</i> (song) to further arouse and inspire their souls, like “<i>Yedid Nefesh</i>,” “<i>Adon Olam</i>,” “<i>Mizmor L’David</i>,” and so forth. If their souls are emblazed and they want to dance, then they shall dance, provided that they don’t use up all of their time together just for drinking, singing, and dancing.
All writings of Chassidus are good and holy, sanctifying and purifying those who learn them. And still, each one is welcome to concentrate on the one <i>sefer</i> that he feels has the greatest power to enhance his connection to <i>kedushah</i> and closeness to God.
The members of the <i>chevraya</i> are strongly encouraged to put much effort into learning the <b>Tseitel HaKatan</b> of my holy ancestor, Rabbi Elimelech of Lyzhensk.
The members of the <i>chevraya</i> should make sure to sit together at <i>Shalosh Seudos</i>, the third meal at the conclusion of the Shabbos, as was previously described in depth. The <i>Shalosh Seudos</i> is like the Yom Kippur of the week. The day of Yom Kippur reveals the soul, cleanses it, and heals it of its illnesses for the entire year. So too, <i>Shalosh Seudos</i>, the Yom Kippur of the week, purifies the soul, reveling it and all of the yearnings, aches and pains that were hidden throughout the week. In the middle of the week the soul also aspires to take off and fly, but it is weakened from the harassment of adversaries and marauders who trample it, forcing its mouth shut so its voice is not heard. In such a state no one is aware that his own soul is sick with love. And then when Shabbos comes, man leaves behind the din of the world and all of its multitude, especially at the time of <i>Shalosh Seudos</i>, when he enters the inner sanctum of the <i>Kodesh HaKodashim</i>, delivering over his whole being to the Holy One. Then all of the yearnings of the <i>nefesh</i> show themselves. The nefesh cries over the pain it suffered throughout the week, days and nights, sometimes with aggressive desire, calling, “draw Your servant to Your will,”<sup class="footnote-marker">231</sup><i class="footnote">Yedid Nefesh.</i> sometimes with terrible pain crying out from the depths, “look God how they have beat me and wounded me,<sup class="footnote-marker">232</sup><i class="footnote">See Shir HaShirim, 5:7</i> bringing me so far away from you,” and crying, “God, please heal her.”<sup class="footnote-marker">233</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar, 12:13</i>
The meeting place for the <i>chevraya</i> should be regarded by every member as holy ground, the place of the Omnipresent, a mikvah of the soul that cleanses and prepares it to enter the precinct of the Shechinah who dwells in that very place. At the time that one enters there he should consider as if he has left the jurisdiction of the physical world and entered into a branch of the lower Garden of Eden that God had extended into their meeting place. When he thinks about the meeting place and the <i>chevraya</i> his heart should rejoice in its holy chambers, thinking how fortunate he is to be worthy even in this world of taking refuge under the wings of the Shechinah, and when he is actually in the meeting place his joy should be even greater, thinking, “the holy Shechinah is among us!” “My soul is sick with Your love!” “Please God, heal her by showing he the pleasantness of Your splendor.” He should yearn for God to reveal a spark of the pleasantness of His splendor and the beauty of His strength even in his own heart, as he stands in this holy space.
Even though all of the members of the <i>chevraya</i> are to be friends, loving each other with a great love, still, each one should develop one particularly close friendship, someone to whom he can reveal all the deepest and most hidden things of his heart, his falls and ascents, failures and successes. His friend should listen carefully, empathize with him, console him, advise him, and bring joy to him as much as he is able. Each one should also try to advise the other in spiritual matters, offering guidance to the best of his abilities.
The members of the <i>chevraya</i> should not announce or advertise the activities of their association in public places, such as streets or marketplaces, nor should they otherwise post presentations of their objectives or explanations of their methods. They should not boast about the <i>chevraya</i> and its ways to others. When God commanded Moshe to go up and receive the second set of the Two Tablets of the Law God said, “no man shall be with you when you go up.” Rashi comments that the evil eye had caused the breaking of the first set of the Two Tablets since their appearance was accompanied fireworks, angelic fanfares, and multitudes of onlookers. Rashi ends by saying - “there is nothing as beautiful as modesty.” The holy Zohar was only revealed to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the privacy of his cave, in the secrecy of the wilderness. For this reason, the teachings of the Kabbalah are called the sod – the secret.<sup class="footnote-marker">234</sup><i class="footnote">In this way, there is an essential connection between the secrecy of Kabbalah and modesty, privacy.</i> Similarly, all holy <i>avodah</i> which facilitates the revelation of the soul is in opposition to clamor and publicity. It is rather nurtured by privacy, even secrecy – “and God was not in the thunder.”<sup class="footnote-marker">235</sup><i class="footnote">Melachim 1, 19:11</i> But if a new member wants to join, he should be received graciously with open arms, and informed of all the ways of the <i>chevraya</i>, provided it is clear that his intentions are pure. Similarly, if a member meets someone for whom he thinks involvement in the <i>chevraya</i> would be mutually benefitial, it is permitted to explain to him the ways of the <i>chevraya</i> and encourage him to join, provided that the one encouraging him is not hiding any ulterior motives.
If any member of the <i>chevraya</i> is hassled by work and the pressures of earning a living, he should make the following declaration several times during the course of his work day while he is feeling the pressure: “Master of the World! I am in a dangerous place full of threats to my soul and my <i>kedushah</i>. Do not forsake me now. Stand by me and guard me, O guardian of Israel.” He doesn’t have to use these exact words, but something like this in any language that is comfortable for him.
It cannot be more strongly emphasized that the main point of the <i>chevraya</i> is not the chevraya itself, but the member, friend, man, <i>Avreich</i>, and <i>Bachur</i> who enters into the <i>avodah</i> of the <i>chevraya</i>. When the Gemara tells us to form groups for the study of Torah, because the Torah is only acquired through association with others, it is not trying to tell us that the group and not the individual is the primary focus, and that if a person cannot study together with others then he should not study alone, God forbid. After all, the Mishna<sup class="footnote-marker">236</sup><i class="footnote">Avos, Chapter 3 Mishna 2</i> tells us that even if a man studies Torah alone God rewards him, as it is written, “He sits alone in silence, because God has placed it upon him.”<sup class="footnote-marker">237</sup><i class="footnote">Eicha, 3:28</i> If our discussion in these pages have emphasized the group, it is only in response to a grave threat. The Jewish people are compared to a house whose every corner is burning in flames, with our enemies attacking us and embittering our lives from without and our own coldness to the Torah and the <i>avodah</i> threatening us from within. This danger could bring about our physical and spiritual destruction, God forbid. We already said at the beginning of A Student’s Obligation that the only thing that can save Israel from assimilation and the desolation caused by such an ice-age of <i>avodah</i> is when the child, young man, and <i>Avreich</i> serves God and learns Torah with the fire of Chassidus, and feels the delights it brings from the Garden of Eden. And just as one man’s lonely pail of water cannot put out a raging fire, but only when water is brought from all directions – one with his pails, this one with his barrels, and this one with his bottles - so too, it is not enough for Chassidus alone, even though it is the crucial and sure-fire medicine, cannot save Israel from destruction even if it is ingested into our bodies and souls according to the methods and practices that we have presented. Like those other pails of water, we also need the <i>chevraya</i>. But the <i>chevraya</i> is not the vital ingredient. If we use all of these means together, then maybe God will help and save our bodies and souls from pending destruction.
We ask that not only the Chassid who is a part of the <i>chevraya</i>, but also the Chassid who never even had the possibility of the <i>chevraya</i>, and serves God by himself, should take upon himself to do all that we have asked in these protocols. If you ask on what authority we ask that someone not involved in the <i>chevraya</i> should accept such an obligation, we refer you to the Mishne Torah of the Rambam,<sup class="footnote-marker">238</sup><i class="footnote">Hilchot Miskav U’Moshav, Chapter 10 See Mishna Demai, Ch. 2 Mishna 3.</i> who decrees that in this age, even a <i>talmid chacham</i> (Torah scholar) should accept upon himself “<i>divrei chaverus</i>.”<sup class="footnote-marker">239</sup><i class="footnote">This is a concept pertaining to the laws of Taharos, ritual purity, which since the destruction of the Temple (may it be rebuilt soon and in our lifetimes) has been out of practice. As we said at the outset, a Chaver, or friend, also means an individual dedicated to the Torah. A chaver is assumed to be ritually pure, so one could receive food from him and not worry that it had been contaminated. An “am ha’aretz,” meaning an unlearned Jew, (specifically, a Jew who is ignorant of the laws of purity [Taharos] and the laws of tithing,) is assumed to be ritually impure, (as he simply does not know how to keep pure, remove impurity, etc.) so that any food or vessel received from him is suspect. If an am ha’aretz wants remove this assumption of ritual contamination, he may accept upon himself “<i>Divrei chaverus</i>.” Based on the Mishna in Demai, (2:3) the Rambam writes, “what is <i>divrei chaverus</i>? He vows to be careful of not becoming contaminated by defiled things, to be careful of not contaminating things that are ritually pure, to be careful of netilas yadayim (ritual hand washing), and keeping his hands pure by not receiving anything wet from an am ha’aretz, not being a guest in the house of an am ha’aretz not hosting him in his house while the am ha’aretz is wearing his own clothes (as they are more suseptable to contamination than the am ha’aretz’s body).” The Rambam continues in Halacha 3, “from the time of the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash the Cohanim agreed among themselves with elitist suspicion that they would refrain from handing ritually pure objects or food even to Talmidei Chachamim unless they had accepted the conditions of <i>divrei chaverus</i>.”<br>But now we have no Temple, no Cohen who has a ritually pure object to give, no continual offering nor even the altar to atone for our sins, and no ashes of the red heifer to purify us from defilement, only cigarette ashes to smear on our heads and let us remember what we had and what we need to yearn for. If we could only do what we need to do to change our bereavement into holy simchah, we would be standing before the Temple in an instant. <br>The defilement that the Rebbe is hinting at is a spiritual defilement. Not a concrete defilement of ritual impurity, where if I touch a wet apple I have to be aware that I have just defiled the apple, but the defilement of a cold, unfeeling avodah, where I am saying the words of the prayers by not aware what I am saying or to Whom I am praying. But in the interest of accentuating the positive, which we should all strive to do, let us say that a pure avodah is an avodah with a revealed soul. And in order to preserve this pure avodah, the Piasesner Rebbe advises even a Chassid who is not connected to an association to fulfill all of the advice given to the association as every word of advice is a method that facilitates this revelation. In this way, members of a chevraya need not suspect a lone servant of God and cast aspersions on his avodah, or in the context of our discussion, alienate him simply because he is not a part of the group. This advice is a way of fostering unity if not among all Jews, because “you need to learn to walk before you can run,” and as he said a member who is not suitable could harm the interests of the <i>chevraya</i>, but at least among the Chassidim, where there is much work to be done.</i> In truth, such a vow should be said before three Jews, but on this point we will not be overly strict, and it is enough for him to accept the conditions alone before his Master. We will provide you with a text of the vow below.
There is a story in the Gemara about the meeting of Reish Lakish and Rebbi Yochanan.<sup class="footnote-marker">240</sup><i class="footnote">One day Rebbi Yochanan was bathing in the Jordan, when Resh Lakish saw him and dived into the Jordan after him. Seeing such a strong man doing such an impressive dive, Rebbi Yochanan said to Reish Lakish, ‘Your strength should be for the Torah.’ ‘Your beauty,’ Reish Lakish replied, ‘should be for women.’ ‘If you will repent,’ said he, ‘I will give you my sister to marry, who is more beautiful than I.’ Reish Lakish agreed to mend his ways and accept the Torah, but when he wished to return and collect his weapons, he found he could not (as accepting the “yoke” of the Torah was such a heavy weight that it sapped all of his strength. In other words, he learned that physical strength pales in comparison to spiritual and moral strength.) Subsequently, Rabbi Yochanan taught him Torah and Mishnah, which made him into a great man.</i> The story begins with Reish Lakish jumping into the river where Rebbi Yochanan was bathing. After a life changing conversation, involving the prospects of marrying pretty wife and gaining a holy man for a brother in law, Reish Lakish accepted upon himself the yoke of the Torah. However, upon accepting this yoke of responsibility (<i><b>olah</b> shel Torah</i>), Reish Lakish found that he was so weak that he could barely get out of the river and get dressed. Why was this? This was just the beginning. Meaning, you would think that he would only be exhausted after sitting down for hours in the house of study and exerting all of his strength on his Torah study. Here he was exhausted only after accepting the obligations of the Torah. If a Jew has the power of speech whereby he can simply declare an animal holy by pronouncing the words, “this is an <i><b>olah</b></i> (ascent offering), and on the strength of that declaration the whole animal, skin, bones, meat, and muscle, takes on the power of <i>kodshim</i>, whereby if a man blemishes that animal or defiles its sanctity<sup class="footnote-marker">241</sup><i class="footnote">An example of defiling the sanctity of an olah would be sacrificing it outside of the Beis Hamikdash, or sacrificing in the Temple it with the intention of eating it after the proscribed time in which it is allowed to be eaten (pigul).</i> he is culpable of <i>kares</i> – (excision),<sup class="footnote-marker">242</sup><i class="footnote">Kares is a serious punishment for certain serious transgressions. The exact punishment is either death by the hand of heaven before age fifty, going childless, living to see the death of a son or daughter, or a spiritual excision, that is to say being spiritually cut of from the Jewish people.</i> then doesn’t Reish Lakish also have the power to declare himself holy? It is just the same when an Israelite accepts upon himself to bear the yoke of the Torah. Since all of Reish Lakish’s power before he returned to God’s law was merely physical prowess dedicated to less than moral activities, then from the moment when he accepted upon himself the yoke of the Torah he had consecrated his very body, and the result was that all of his former strength was sapped to the point where he could barely move.<sup class="footnote-marker">243</sup><i class="footnote">This may be saying that all of Reish Lakish’s physical power was tainted, even defiled, and if such power were to come into contact with Reish Lakish after he had become kodsesh by accepting the Torah, he would have been, as it were, a defiled sacrifice. It is just that God is forgiving and gave Reish Lakish the oppurtnity to start over again.</i>
Onkelos translates the words of the Torah, <sup class="footnote-marker">244</sup><i class="footnote">Parshas Ekev</i> “<i>vehaya ekev tishm’un</i>” as, “and it shall be that when you <i>accept the responsibility</i> of these laws, to keep them and do them …” The <b>Imrei Elimelech </b>explains that from the very moment you have taken it upon yourself to adhere to the laws of the Torah, be prepared to actually do them. This is similar to the usage, “<i>v’aviv shamar et hadavar</i> – and his father kept the matter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">245</sup><i class="footnote">When Yosef told his dreams to his brothers, they dismissed his dreams as a product of his desire to rule over them, but didn’t really accept that his dreams were indeed harbingers of future events. Yaakov kept the matter in his mind, meaning that Yaakov kept the belief that Yosef’s dreams were prophetic. Rashi says that Yaakov waited and anticipated the day that the message of these dreams would indeed become a reality. The point is clear, that by definition, accepting responsibility is an acceptance of something that will a man will do at a future time.</i> This is akin to the way we renew our acceptance of the responsibility of the Torah every year on Shavuos, the festival of the giving of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">246</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah was given on the sixth day of the month of Sivan c. 2480 (1280 b.c.e.) The holy Ari z”l teaches us that every day of the year, the light of historical events that happened on that day descends into the world. As a nation, we accepted the responsibility fulfilling the obligations of the Torah on that day 3287 years ago. Every year on this very day we are granted an new revelation of this same light and renew our commitment.</i> The very act of accepting consecrates us - makes us <i>kodesh</i> - and with the power of that <i>kedushah</i> we do throughout the year what we have accepted upon ourselves to do. Whenever a person makes something <i>kodesh</i>, he has to specify what kind of <i>kedushah</i> he wants to draw unto it. If he makes a declaration to consecrate an animal sacrifice as an <i>olah</i>, an ascent offering, then it is an <i>olah</i>, and if he consecrates an animal as a <i>chatas</i>, a sin offering, it is a <i>chatas</i>. So in addition to our general declaration accepting upon ourselves to keep the Torah which consecrates us to the Torah, we need to accept upon ourselves the obligations of <i>avodas Hashem</i> in the way of Chassidus and thereby become consecrated to the kedushah of Chassidus. Now we shall provide a declaration whereby the Chassid may accept upon himself to <i>kedushah</i> of Chassidus, and in accepting such intent, he will attain greater heights in <i>kedushah</i> and shine with a greater light.
Declaration of Acceptance.
With a willing heart, and in accordance with the yearning of my soul (nefesh, ruach, and neshama), I hereby accept upon myself the <i>kedushah</i> and <i>avodah</i> of Chassidus, whereby I may be worthy of cleansing and purifying my body and soul, to sanctify them with the <i>kedushah</i> of E-l HaKadosh, binding them to the service of God, and permanently accepting them in my will, thoughts, speech, and actions. From now on, using the power of the Torah which confers upon the Jewish man the power to dedicate and animal as a sacrifice whereby making its very body <i>kodesh</i>, I now stand before Hashem and hereby bind, subdue, and negate myself, in body, nefesh, ruach, and neshama, to the service of Hashem, may He be blessed. And Hashem, who does not despise the <i>kedushah</i> of Israel, will also not despise me, shall channel a direct flow of His <i>kedushah</i> unto me, and wherever I shall be, and in whatever world I shall find myself, Hashem’s <i>kedushah</i> shall hover about me, surrounding me with the seven clouds of glory, from now until eternity.
I now stand before God and implore him with all my heart and soul that if, God forbid, my evil inclination should overwhelm me at any time, causing me immediately to stumble and fail, going against God’s desires in my will, thought, speech, or action, then God, in His infinite mercies, will not despise me, (just as He did not before the error) and He will not expel me outside the veil of the <i>Kodesh HaKodashim</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">247</sup><i class="footnote">The Holy of Holies, the inner sanctum of the Temple in Jerusalem.</i> just as a consecrated animal cannot be taken out of the Temple and used for ordinary use. Rather He will take me with His willing hand, open to receive all who want to return to His way, and return me unto Him in complete <i>teshuvah</i>, exactly as I want at this very moment. With a whole heart and clear mind, I now leave the mountains of separation and the jurisdiction of the <i>Sitra Achra</i><sup class="footnote-marker">248</sup><i class="footnote">The other side (the realm of evil).</i> and its cult, whom I despise, declaring them null and void and as the dust of the earth, and enter together with the 248 limbs and 365 sinews of my body and of my soul, into the jurisdiction of the Shechinah.
From this moment on I accept upon myself to scrupulously oversee all the details of my thoughts, speech, and action, as is becoming of a man who has separated himself and dedicated himself to the supernal <i>kedushah</i>, and not discarded himself to abandon, God forbid. May Hashem sustain me with the right hand of His justice, teach me His way and lead me on His path, the path of holiness, in all bodily and spiritual wellbeing, that my family, friends, and I, together with all of Israel, should enjoy a the length of days and years, living long and living well, with <i>simchah</i> and satisfaction, with good kindness and revealed kindness, in all matters of body, <i>nefesh</i>, <i>ruach</i>, and <i>neshama</i>, illuminated by the highest heavenly lights and beyond.
If you should entertain the notion that this is all too much for you to do and a goal too high for you to reach, be aware that such notions are the product of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i>. Even when God helps you, and you ascend to a place ten times, a thousand times higher that you are now, know that you will not have even reached the ankles of your true greatness as a Jew, a member of the people Israel. Don’t give up! Rather trust in God and make yourself strong, for we know that you will succeed in your <i>avodah</i>, ascending far higher than you had ever hoped. And yet, the mother and father of all principles is to strive for greatness, which means doing all that you have accepted upon yourself. In doing so you will have the privilege of being counted among those whose, “words stand strong like a wall.”<sup class="footnote-marker">249</sup><i class="footnote">Bereshis Rabba, 39. Or “stand as firm as a wall.” (Soncino). This means that your words become deeds, and in this you sustain your life as the walls holds up a house.</i> It is not just someone who is only interested in the leniencies of the oral and written Torahs who is considered a lightweight. A man who flutters in the wind like a feather, blown away by every turn and gust, is a real lightweight. Such a feather is a man whose aspirations and words do not become deeds. Today he is trembling in love and fear over every word of God and promising everything in the world, and tomorrow there is no more trembling and no more promises, God forbid.

Chapter 12

<big><strong>Whole-Heartedness and Removing Ulterior Motives</strong></big>
In order to be a Chassid who is dedicated to taking proper care of his soul, who arouses <i>hisragshus</i> in the service of God, a man needs to take great care each day so as not to do anything that might chase his soul away. This is true not only for matters of <i>avodah</i> and <i>hisragshus</i>, but also concerning everyday matters.
In all of your mundane and spiritual affairs,<sup class="footnote-marker">250</sup><i class="footnote">Similar to a perceptive woman knows the difference between a man who is flattering her, or even helping her around the house just to win her affections, and one who sacrifices his time and energy to care for her because he feels real love in his heart and a real commitment to her wellbeing, so too God, who by definition knows all and sees all. He knows when your <i>avodah</i> is real and when it is phony. He knows things that you hide in your heart that you are totally unaware of. He knows you better than you know yourself. It may be easy to deceive yourself, but it is impossible to deceive Hashem. <br>God loves an honest <i>avodah</i>, meaning simply that you are not learning Torah so others will stand up when you enter the room, but out of your love for God’s Torah, and you daven with fire not so other people will think you are an angel, but because your heart is really on fire with love for God.</i> strive for simplicity and honesty,<sup class="footnote-marker">251</sup><i class="footnote">“Temimus,” in Hebrew is a word with multiple connotations. Depending on the context, one could also use words like, “simple” “simple minded,” “wholeness,” “complete” “perfect” “whole-hearted,” “uprightness of heart,” “innocence,” “naiveté,” and now “finished.” Rav Shlomo Carlebach z’l used to say that The “headquarters” for every word in Hebrew is the first time it appears in the Torah. So in order to truly understand the meaning of this word, we need to return to headquarters. The first usage of the root of “temimus,” – “tam” – appears in the verse, “Yaakov was an ish Tam, sitting in tents.” Rashi teaches us that “tam” is used in contradistinction to the spurious and manipulative cunning of Eisav, the hunter and “man of the field,” saying that, “Yaakov was not expert in all of these ways, but rather as he knew in his heart, so did he speak with his mouth. Someone who is not “hot to swindle,” is called, ‘tam.’ ” <br>A good translation is “transparency.” Whatever a man does or says should ideally be a transparent expression of his thoughts and feelings, which in themselves are a transparent and unfettered broadcast of the soul. Whatever is in the roots is also found in the trunk and branches, the leaves and the fruit. <br>According to Elie Wiesel, naiveté in French does not have the pejorative connotation that naïve has in English. It is rather a simple, honest, and innocent quality.</i> for honesty is the authority of the soul over man and his actions, where guile<sup class="footnote-marker">252</sup><i class="footnote">The opposite of “temimus,” is “armoomius,” meaning craftiness, cunningness, and trickery.</i> is a sign that the soul is missing and the intellect is in control. Guile is not the inner intellect that comes from man’s soul, but the external intellect of the world, - such as cunning artifice in man’s commercial dealings, or calculated deceit by politicians. These things are what the world considers “smart.” It is a force which is so often employed to direct mans activities, conduct, speech, and thoughts.
When we use the word guile, we are not only referring to behavior based on deception or plain old lying, but are rather focusing on the inner source of thoughts and emotions that leads to actual deceit. We seek to answer the question, “Why does man lie?” More specifically, what is the nature of the soul’s dysfunction that causes man to become a liar, to the point where all of his thoughts, words, and actions are distorted, lifeless, out of touch with reality and truth?
“God’s seal is truth.” The whole world is stamped with this seal. A real plant bears the life force of a growing, living being. Simply put, it is true. An imitation flower sculpted in wax or plastic, no matter how much it looks like a flower, is a deception. Truth is reality, lying is pandering something off that isn’t really there.<sup class="footnote-marker">253</sup><i class="footnote">Though the lie is really a lie, it seeks to communicate does not really exist. Of course the imitation flower communicates a certain truth, namely, a fake flower. But still, the wax flower is essentially a deception.</i> Our sages say, “truth exists, falsehood does not exist.”<sup class="footnote-marker">254</sup><i class="footnote">Gemara, Shabbos, 104</i> Truth is representative of life, and falsehood comes from the side of death which has no inner substance or being. Reality is truth. Truth and honesty are expressed when all of a man’s affairs, actions, and thoughts reveal his soul.
When a plant grows, it is pure honesty and simplicity. In growing, it doesn’t grow in order to manipulate something outside of itself, what is commonly called an ulterior motive. It makes no fake moves in order to deceive. A plant grows only because this is its being, this is the existence within it, and because its soul pushes it to grow and spread forth. A child’s behavior is also an expression of simplicity and honesty. A child’s behavior expresses the feelings and growth<sup class="footnote-marker">255</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe Zts”l uses the word “hispashtus,” which is a major concept and key vocabulary word in the teachings of Chassidus and Kabbalah. It means both spreading forth, or promulgation, and undressing. Maturity is achieved when the soul spreads forth, and even more when the soul is “undressed,” of emotions and worldly vanities that conceal it. A man has reached real maturity in avodas Hashem, only when he acts with <i>erlechkeit</i>, namely with the middos of honesty and simplicity. This is a sign that his soul is revealed and spreading its influence in the world.</i> of his soul. If an adult only does everything he does with his soul, even if he is intelligent, he shall by honest and truthful. And if he does not act with simplicity, and his actions do not represent the nature of his heart and soul with simplicity and clarity, then he is not real.<sup class="footnote-marker">256</sup><i class="footnote">He is either kidding himself, misrepresenting himself, or lying to himself. Like the slang expression, “are you for real?”</i> In such a case his actions are based on lies. In order to have such a dysfunction one doesn’t have to be so out of touch with reality that he goes around asserting that a tree is actually a rock. The inner genesis of expressed falsehood flows from the “side of death,” God forbid. (We are defining death as the absence of reality or substance.) When a person is a liar, all of his actions and thoughts are “unreal,” and unsubstantiated.
A child’s sweetness and gracefulness comes from his qualities of simplicity and honesty (or naiveté). When you speak to a child, you really feel that he is speaking from his soul. When you ask him a question, the question goes into his soul and yields a simple and honest answer. His whole heart is in his answer. We are not suggesting that you should have a mind not greater than that of a child’s.<sup class="footnote-marker">257</sup><i class="footnote">The “way of honesty” does not mean doing away with your intellectual powers.</i> All we expect from you is to be whole-hearted and honest. That is to say, if someone asks you a question, don’t fret and scheme about how to answer him. Don’t bother spinning your wheels by thinking, “Society and etiquette dictate that this is a good answer. But then again, if I give this particular answer he will think that I am clever. But if I want to trick him into giving me what I want, then I should say this.” Your answer will be a lot of hot air, meticulously gathered from the four corners of the earth and adding up to a great, big nothing. “If I say this it is well received and people will like me, but if I say this they will think I am scholarly.” And what you will have in the end – in reality – is no reality, no soul, and no truth. However, you will be the recipient of a real windfall of emptiness and nothingness.
First of all, try to give a serious and earnest answer. Think about how you really feel, and then just say it, honestly and simply. In formulating your answer, use your intellect only in order to make sure that you are not mistaken. If your intellect is pure<sup class="footnote-marker">258</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe zts”l used the word “pashut,” which we have been translating as “simple.” However, as he made it clear that you don’t need to be simple-minded, like a child, the word, “pure,” has been replaced, which conveys the correct connotation, as long as you don’t read, “a pure intellect,” as meaning, “only intellect and nothing more.” Earlier, the Rebbe zts”l mentioned and praised the pure and moral intellect flows from the soul.</i> and serious, then it will become a valuable instrument that serves the purity and honesty of your heart, helping to realize these attributes in your behavior. If you find that such an honest answer might somehow harm you or otherwise make your life more difficult than it needs be, then just say, “I don’t know.” Our sages in the Gemara advise us not give the twisted and crafty answers of a bankrupt heart and busted integrity.
There are people who are wily by nature. Such people need to work much harder to straighten their path to the point where they come to their souls rescue and start behaving with candor and simplicity. Fortunately, there are not so many Jews with this problem, for the Jewish people are good and honest, even holy, by nature. More often we find people who think that they are wily by nature, but in fact they have only been defrauded, raised from the cradle in a society that encourages deception, bottle fed on the notion that they will only be rewarded for their guile. Social norms base on guile have twisted their minds and their spirit of straightforwardness. It is a comfort to know that it is not so difficult to solve these problems. But you cannot just blame society. Weak personalities<sup class="footnote-marker">259</sup><i class="footnote">Literally, “a weak or flimsy spirit.”</i> are more susceptible to letting society put a kink in their hearts, a kink which impairs the impulse which compels them to the truth. Easily caving into the frauds of society, a weak personality (a reflection of a weak or concealed soul) lacks the natural inner tendency to speak the truth he well knows.
Chazal have told us, “Words of truth are recognizable.”<sup class="footnote-marker">260</sup><i class="footnote">Sotah, 9 (soncino trans.)</i> But how and why are they recognizable? Everyone knows that your average liar can’t pull it off so easily, unless he happens to be a seasoned con artist. He will show what con artists call, “a tell.” That is to say, at the moment when he is lying he will broadcast it physically, averting his glance down or to the side, unable to look his “mark”<sup class="footnote-marker">261</sup><i class="footnote">A “mark” in the jargon of confidence men is the person who they are attempting to con.</i> in the eyes. When a man is relating something that truly happened to him, and then he gets to a point where, for whatever reason, he starts to lie, you can tell that he is lying because you see how he no longer speaks with the same self-confidence or ease that he exhibited when he was telling the truth.
Why is this? It is because his living soul was at odds with his lie. That is to say, when he spoke the truth, he was speaking with his living soul, which is in itself the truth, as we have mentioned, but when he came to speak falsely, then the truth, the living soul within him, objected to his decision to lie, as it did not want him to destroy himself with lies and death. The truth looks after him. Any measure of a guilty conscience brought on by the slap of his true, living spirit on his lying intellect caused his heart to skip a beat, his eyes to look away, and his confidence to run off and hide.<sup class="footnote-marker">262</sup><i class="footnote">The problem is no so much that it will hide itself well, or even for a long time, but rather that it will hide so well that he will forget to even try to look for it. This is the idea behind the “hide and seek” story about the Maggid of Mezeritch and his young son.</i> In short, his physical gestures reacted to his inner conflict. It is difficult for the brave-spirited to lie because he is being protected by the strength of his true, living soul. This is not so for a man whose weak personality and spirit cowers before his decision to act or speak with guile. He is a straw man. It could be that he is so spiritually bereft that he is rendered spineless and doesn’t feel compelled at all by the living truth that resides deep within him. For this reason he piles lies upon lies according to what he thinks is good for him or will bring him pleasure, even thought all of his actions are not truly expressing of his mind and feelings, because the waters of the living reality we call the truth have apparently evaporated from his heart, leaving it like a tattered, dried out sack filled with nothing. Just as a bloodless heart cannot beat, truth and reality cannot be expressed by a man whose real feelings and inner soul are compromised<sup class="footnote-marker">263</sup><i class="footnote">Or concealed.</i> by his desire for others admiration, confidence, or reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">264</sup><i class="footnote">Or in the case of the con man, the wanton desire to get something out of another by means of deception.</i>
I took a glimpse at what is happening under the façade of a flatterer.<sup class="footnote-marker">265</sup><i class="footnote">“Chanfan:” a flatterer, toady or in the colloquial, a “yes man.”</i> Flattery is a symptom (or a “tell,” as it were.) of an insincere type that results from a weak personality. It is the way such a personality communicates his soul’s bill of health. The root of the handicap is the inability of the weak personality to stand up to his real feelings and desires.<sup class="footnote-marker">266</sup><i class="footnote">Such a dysfunction either conceals or chases away his <i>nefesh</i>. The difference between concealment and banishment of the soul requires further study. If a man cannot feel, has he somehow “chased away,” his soul, or merely concealed it with distractions? The opening thesis of this chapter suggests that the dominance of the worldly intellect, which allows deception as a means of achieving self-gratification, interferes with the revelation, or dominance, of the Godly soul, which is itself truth and the source of life. Whether you describe it as concealment or banishment only implies a difference in the degree of the severity of the condition.</i> It brings a man to negate himself - either by suppressing or denying his real feelings, and then putting on an act in order to curry favor with his friends or associates. Whether or not he is aware of his act, his own self-abnegation and inner weakness often brings him to speak falsely. You can see how a weak personality, or the dysfunction of intellect and desire that interferes with his <i>nefesh</i>, is certainly the reason behind of many tragic character flaws other than lying, such as fickle mindedness, the outright inability to stick to a decision without feeling remorse, regret, or anxiety.<sup class="footnote-marker">267</sup><i class="footnote">Such modus operandum might exhibit themselves in a sad, furtive person, or even be the hidden cause behind a good time Charlie who takes nothing too seriously other than parties, female companionship, and television, but regardless, they are both symptomatic of his own feelings of self-worthlessness. In neglecting to take proper care of his soul, he has given up on his goal of becoming a <i>menche</i>.</i> Like a feather in the breeze, he struts and frets on his life’s stage for want of a brave <i>nefesh</i>, a condition with serious consequences. Yes, he may lead a flighty existence,<sup class="footnote-marker">268</sup><i class="footnote">sometimes in <i>shiur</i> and sometimes in a bar.</i> but for the time being there is one constant that stays with him as he flutters in the wind; his soul is absent.<sup class="footnote-marker">269</sup><i class="footnote">It is not that he is totally bereft of a soul, but that his actions are not done with soul.</i>
In A Student’s Obligation<sup class="footnote-marker">270</sup><i class="footnote">Chapter 7.</i> we spoke about the deceptive feeling of worthlessness that one could feel when he is the brunt of another man’s taunts or insults. The foundation of these feelings is the absence of bravery. Rav Ovadia of Bartenura zts’l, in his famous commentary on the Mishna, offers us a real key to the attribute of bravery. When the Mishna tells us, “who is mighty? A man who conquers his <i>yetser</i>,” we need to understand that it is war of attrition that we are fighting with the <i>yetser</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">271</sup><i class="footnote">That is to say, the <i>yetser</i> wants us to give up or give in. It wants us to use our energy for pleasure or revenge.</i> The <b>Bartenura</b> tells us, “The patience<sup class="footnote-marker">272</sup><i class="footnote">The term the Bartenura uses is, “erech apayim.” See Shemos, 34:6, which describes God’s attribute of being, “Slow to anger,” (Kaplan, Margolin), and ”Long Suffering.” (Soncino) It is an ambiguous term that is gererally understood as patience. “<i>Erech</i>” means length or lengthening, and “<i>apayim</i>” carries the triple connotation of anger, the face, and the nostrils. “I will soften my anger,” or simply “taking a breather.”</i> that you need when you hold back, using your strength to conquer the yetser is not to be confused with a weak spirit.” Bravery and might is also expressed in your own self-restraint, when you use your might to conquer the yetser by actually resisting its advice.<sup class="footnote-marker">273</sup><i class="footnote">Mighty (“gibbur”) is the man or woman whose actions, words, and mind operate according to the activity of resistance as opposed to the passivity of resignation. This is not only, “a big man knows when to walk away from a fight,” but more often, “just do it,” and do away with it by just not doing it.</i> Your might is good and well when it is put into the power of patience, as long as it is truly restraining your desire to enjoy something that will come to harm you, but not an kind of emotional paralysis brought on by cowardice.<sup class="footnote-marker">274</sup><i class="footnote">The tell for cowardice is getting weak in the knees, sweaty palms, nervous laughter, or just about anything, as long as it a physical sign of your fear of confronting your true feelings with bravery. The tell for bravery might be clenching your fists, grinding your teeth, and so forth, as an expression of your will to refrain from transgression, including insincere behavior such as flattery.</i>
We are stressing the importance of bravery, which is an expression of the soul’s might (<i>gevurah</i>), but beware of misusing such inner might with by arrogant or stubborn behavior. The sages teach us that if someone is rude, it is a sign that he is a poor student of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">275</sup><i class="footnote">One who is truly learned in Torah will naturally conduct himself according to the middos espoused by the Torah. Immodest behavior and the use of crude language from even the most intelligent scholars is a “tell” that they have not really acquired the Torah and its message. Such teachers should be avoided and held suspect, if not shunned.</i> The difference between the use and abuse of inner might is the difference between a man whose crude, arrogant, and selfish behavior shows his lack of bravery, and another whose bravery is actually revealed in modest behavior. He is as unassuming and frail as a blade of grass, but it is a natural product of his inner resolve not to be drawn after their ways, including both their <i>middos</i> and their opinions.<sup class="footnote-marker">276</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe Zts”l uses the word, “deos,” which means attitudes, opinions, but mostly character traits and modes of behavior. Either the secular Hellenistic world view where wisdom and even ethics are totally disconnected from behavior, or the baldy behaved so-called Torah scholar who is not so different, except in that he operates in Orthodox Jewish society. Honesty requires a harmony between ethical thought, speech, and action. Each one must be a reflection of the other.</i> The first type knows the truth. With true bravery, he follows the Torah and the calling of his soul.
If your real desire is to be a Chassid and a <i>ba’al nefesh</i>, then you need to be vigilant and take great care in how you go about all of your daily endeavors. Believe in yourself, and tell yourself that instead of being a liar or a loaf, unstable or undecided, you can be a <i>baal nefesh</i>, who brings his soul to his private life just as he brings it to his community. You can go through life with honesty and integrity, truly living the life of a Chassid whose conduct is simple and direct. When you accustom yourself to serving God, energizing your <i>avodah</i> in a way that reveals your <i>nefesh</i> according to the discussion we are holding over these pages, it will make it easier for you to cast away all kinds of lies, duplicity, pretense, flattery, and deception that creep into your daily routine. You will be able to live with truth and honesty.
“Be honest, (simple, and whole-hearted) with Hashem, your God.”<sup class="footnote-marker">277</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim, 18:13</i> This is a positive commandment which includes almost every service offered to the Omnipresent. There are so many distractions to a pure <i>avodah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">278</sup><i class="footnote">Everything from a noisy neighbor, to world events, from a veiled insult to traumatic humiliation, from a phone bill to bankruptcy, (God forbid it and protect us) removes us from the goal of a pure, honest avodah. Of course, just as harmful are ulterior motives, such as desires for admiration, affection, money, and honor. Keeping the goal of a pure <i>avodah</i> requires constant attention.</i> In Hebrew, such distractions, both external and internal, are called, “<i>p’niyot</i>” (or “<i>pniyah</i>” in the singular.)<sup class="footnote-marker">279</sup><i class="footnote">“ponei” in Hebrew means to turn. Turning from the truth in any form is called, “pniyos.” We have translated it as “distractions.” For example, if you are reading the paper, and you hear a glass breaking, you will likely turn from the paper and look in the direction of the noise. A pniyah is kind of hidden agenda. If someone is paying you to learn, daven, or do any mitzvah, you may similarly feel a distraction, especially if you are not so involved in your work. If, however, you are receiving a stipend in collel (or yeshiva) and you are putting your heart and soul into your avodah, you will inevitably feel less distracted.</i> It is quite common that a man’s feelings for others will compromise his <i>avodah</i>. Clearly, some people find distractions a greater obstacle than others. Everywhere the distracted type goes in the ways of <i>avodah</i> he is chased by distracting thoughts both concerning opponents and loved ones.<sup class="footnote-marker">280</sup><i class="footnote">Who is distracting? The distraction could come anyone, ranging from a clerk giving them grief to a close relative causing them pain, from a friend you are playing tennis with, to a woman you are considering marrying. You are standing in shul, davening, and your mind seizes upon the annoyance of a late delivery, or the way your friend insulted you in the hallway. You could be cooking for Shabbos and thinking, am I doing this because I love God and Shabbos, or just in order to garner approval from friends and family.</i> The reasons other people distract him so easily is simple. His love and fear of God is not as strong as his love and fear for his fellow man. This makes it easier for worthless thoughts in general and ulterior motives in particular to find their way into his mind and soak into his feelings. A less distracted type who is more in love with God and trembles with greater awe before His awesome power and judgment is well protected against the harassment of back-stabbers or any form of social ambush that falls upon him. A worthless thought will find it much more difficult to push its way into his mind. His mind is well fortified, and an enemy thought will not find it easy to break in and push away his good desires and thoughts for the sake of heaven in the efforts to transform the man’s <i>avodah</i> into one that panders to other people’s approval or praises.
Then there are those who are chased by distractions more because they have not yet learned to put their heart into their <i>avodah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">281</sup><i class="footnote">A lack of temimus, whole hearted naiveté and simplicity, is a sign of a lack of dedication.</i> and as such are lacking in “<i>temimus</i>.” In this case, what they do or say is not a transparent expression of their thoughts and feelings. Previously we mentioned how the “<i>tam</i>,”<sup class="footnote-marker">282</sup><i class="footnote">A “tam” is a man who is simple but not necessarily a simpleton, lucid, honest, and refined in his candor, and transparency but not at the expense of his personal safety,</i> is a Chassid, a <i>ba’al nefesh</i> and man of truth. The more a man is “soul challenged,”<sup class="footnote-marker">283</sup><i class="footnote">This is modern American optimist usage for a handicap. A man in a wheelchair is “physically challenged,” and a short person is, “vertically challenged.” That is to say he might be “wearing a black hat,” even an intellectual who is didactic in his performance of mitzvos, but in terms of avodas Hashem he is, for all intensive care purposes, lying in a hospital be with IV’s hooked up to his green skin and yellow eyes. This is the extreme, of course. It is not always so dire. In our analogy, you could say that the more developed religious personalities need only be convalescing, home sick from work, or going around with a bad cold.</i> weak spirited, easy going to the point of being careless, then even when he really wants to serve God, his habitual lightness, his cavalier or savoir faire demeanor causes his mind to cave into distractions. He is then unable to get them out of his mind. They push away his holy desire and good thoughts, actually transforming them into obstacles. The more he becomes a Chassid and a brave baal nefesh, truthful and “tamim,” his good desire will grow stronger and stronger, and he will be less prone to caving into distractions.
I seem to remember once hearing in the name of one of the great Tsaddikim this advice. When you are serving God in any way, imagine that you are standing alone in the forest or in the desert. No one is around for miles. You stand alone in the forest and <i>daven</i> to God, for God only. It is only You and God, and nothing and no one will pull you from the mark.
As previously mentioned, the Holy Baal Shem Tov taught us that it is impossible to serve God in a way that is completely free of ulterior motives, which would include the compulsion to pedantic behavior. To the contrary, when someone is not totally engulfed in the <i>avodah</i>, not spending a great deal of energy looking deep inside himself and evaluating his motives, he will liberally claim that his <i>avodah</i> is true at all levels of truth. And perhaps a greater dilemma arises when you face the difficulty of telling someone that his <i>avodah</i> is fraught with insincerity and less than pure motives, because if he takes your words to heart then there is a great danger that he will abandon his <i>avodah</i> altogether. He could see how the main motivation for his holy service was in order to achieve some questionable or at least peripheral attraction, but certainly not the real point of the <i>avodah</i>. Remove the attraction and the <i>avodah</i> is no longer desired. But if you did not enlighten him with the harsh truth it could very be that given time he will develop an interest in following a pure <i>avodah</i>, succeeding in serving, “lishmah.” (for the sake of heaven). This is as our sages advised us, “always learn Torah even for the wrong reasons, for with persistence you will eventually be learning Torah for the right reasons and for the sake of Heaven.” Yet still, an <i>eved Hashem</i><sup class="footnote-marker">284</sup><i class="footnote">Servant of God.</i> who takes pains to look deeply and honestly inside himself and his avodah will occasionally see an impure motive fluttering around in his soul. The good intention that sparked his devotion is evaluated and turns out to be not entirely pure and for the sake of Heaven, as a slight but disconcerting ulterior motive has tainted his <i>avodah</i>. It is like a precious object that has accumulated dust. Such accumulation is clearly not a product of any overt intention on the part of the eved Hashem, but since he has a yetser ha’rah within him, that part of him that tries make his avodah look good by means of a cosmetic improvement, for this reason he, so to speak, puts dust on it to cover it up. But now that he is aware of his previous insincerity, he gets up and dusts himself off, shaking away the ulterior motive and serving God a pure and energized avodah.
<i>Bachur</i>! <i>Avreich</i>! Since you have offered your neck and shoulders to the yoke of <i>avodah</i>, we sincerely hope and pray to Hashem that you have already been changed into a real man of feeling, an <i>eesh misragesh</i>. The current law under discussion is not only printed on the pages of this book, but chiseled into the walls of your heart. If you want to know if you are following it, ask yourself, “Is there any leniency in Jewish Law<sup class="footnote-marker">285</sup><i class="footnote">It could be the way I daven, the way I learn Torah, or the way I conduct myself with my friends. A son doesn’t usually act the same way he does when he is with his father as he does when he is with his friends. A real key to gauging your own transparency and honesty is if your behavior is consistent both in private and public. Ask yourself, “do I daven alone at home the same way I do in shul?” Some people are known as, “real serious daveners.” They shuckle hard, squeeze their eyes shut, and might even wave their arms around, apparently fighting off the yetser and reaching out for God. They look very serious, shouting <i>yehie shmei raba</i> and <i>barchu</i> with real gusto. Saying the words of the tefillah out loud is a good way to wake up your feelings of hisragshus, but as was said in a previous chapter, a more advanced davener might be able do this in silence and without moving too much. We Jews are not still and silent. The Jewish soul flickers like God’s candle. Absolute stillness and nullification is the prayer style in other religious traditions And yet, many of the great masters of Torah knew how to disappear during the ascent of the soul. Not that their physical body was no longer seen (that is in the category of ma’ase bnei cham), but when their soul ascends to higher planes, they appear to be asleep. You do this when you dream. Ask yourself, “Is it an attempt to look like a Chassid or a product of the desire to reveal my soul?” So you could even go deeper and ask, “Is the intensity of my davening an attempt to paint over my real feelings?” <br>Rav Adin Even Yisrael shlita was once holding court At a yud tes kislev gathering of Chabad Chassidim in Jerusalem that lasted into the early hours of the morning, as is often the case. When things were really heating up with the Bachurim, with singing and dancing, the police arrived at the behest of the neighbors to quiet things down. I started to wonder why the police don’t show up at the mosque when the blaring wails of the muezzin cry out at four in the morning. (Several obvious reasons came to mind; it is their big ben, and the government wants to preserve “peace and order”). After the police appearance, Rav Adin said, “you have to be careful about blatant or grandiose expressions of exuberance, because sometimes you do them to cover up for an inner lack of feeling.”</i> that I rely upon when I am alone, but when I am around other people, in <i>shul</i> or in <i>yeshivah</i>, in the street or in the supermarket, I do not? If you are privately lenient and only publicly strict with yourself, then have mercy on your immortal soul and be strict with yourself at home or whenever no one is around either just to see what a big <i>machmir</i><sup class="footnote-marker">286</sup><i class="footnote">Machmir, means being strict with oneself about any or all Torah laws.</i> you are, or frighten you into strictures lest they question your seriousness. If your yetser ha’rah comes to tempt you with words of encouragement, saying, “You are a stand up Bachur! You are a serious davener and a brilliant learner, no? So let’s face it, with such strong dedication you must be miles away from even a hint of sin,” then turn to your inner opponent and say, “but I am not so far from deceiving myself, and that’s a very serious sin. Under no condition do I want to live the life of a lying scoundrel from the other side.” With everything you say to yourself, everything you think or feel, ask yourself if you would say this out loud to someone else, to your mother or father, to your Rabbi or your friends. The converse is also true. When you are engaging in <i>avodas Hashem</i> in public, and you find yourself disturbed when a less than pure motive for your actions steals into your mind, then you need to go deep. Look inside yourself, don’t be afraid. Were you inspired by the love and awe of the Almighty’s presence in your strictness and holiness, or was it really just because you are frightened of other’s reactions or seeking their approval? If your motives were not pure, then take a break from your <i>avodah</i>. An hour later, when you are home alone, go into it again in the same way. Do you still feel inspired? If the awakening of inspiration was indeed for the sake of Heaven, then you have yet again been a victim of the <i>yetser ha’rah</i>, scattering the poison dust on you only after the action. The <i>yetser</i> has ambushed your confidence and self-esteem. In its desire to pull you away from avodas Hashem, it asks you questions<sup class="footnote-marker">287</sup><i class="footnote">The snake in the Garden of Eden, known as the first lawyer, according to Rav EY, did much the same. Notice how it opens by hissing a question, “did God really say don’t eat from any tree in the Garden?” It already anticipates that she will, with simple naivety, say no, just that tree. Then, like a prosecuting attorney trying to discredit a witness, the snake can continue and “lead” the witness, which is against court procedure, as everyone knows from TV law shows.</i> intended to weaken your faith, doubt your sincerity, or at very worst, give up, God forbid. So don’t listen its questions.<sup class="footnote-marker">288</sup><i class="footnote">At first it may not seek to get you to abandon Torah observance, God forbid. However, it will start by casting aspersions on whether or not you can be a Chassid or a Baal Nefesh. It will say, “the goal is too high, and the headache is too painful. Just look at Reb Beryl, he’s on the level of being a chassid, but you just cant get there.” Just hold onto the knowledge that though, “not every Jew is holy, every Jew is really the Holy of the Holiest,” not every Jew is a big Chassid, but every Jew, Ashkenazi or Sephardi, has within him a unique spark of <i>kedushah</i>, that “pintle yid,” that unites him with every other Jew. He may not be outwardly holy, but if he wants to he can do the greatest thing a man can do. He can refine himself, and thereby assimilate his desires with God’s. The Torah says (Devarim, 32)“Ci Chelek Yisrael Amo,” the Jewish soul, and Jewish people are a portion of God, just because we have the DNA of Yaakov Avinu and have access to his inheritance. If you use the inheritance, you are holy. And if you do not it doesn’t mean that it is not yours for the taking if you ever decide to possess it. You are God’s first born, God’s own treasured project. If you don’t want to take his gifts, He doesn’t say, “That’s it, its over. You lost your chance.” He is our wise father, abundantly patient and always keeping his promise. <br>Every Jew’s pintle yid is both a gift and a veritable portion of God. The Holy Rav Yisrael ben Eliezar (Baal Shem Tov) teaches us, “God is everywhere, God is infinite. He is within time and space and beyond time and space. So if you hold onto a part of God, even and infinitesimal part, you are really holding onto the whole.” So don’t let any man or yetser ever dare to cause you to feel that you are not worthy. This, and the world, was only created for you. It was given to you. It is there for the taking. But to be a Chassid, to be a Baal Nefesh, just like being a shoemaker, doctor, lawyer or even a good beggar, takes daily effort. And God never makes His mistvos impossible. He gives you the strength to do what he asks of you and to become the mentche you were meant to be.</i> The sign that you are honest and whole in your <i>avodah</i> is that you do it alone just as you do it in public. And even if, God forbid, you think that you can’t cast it away, think again, and keep doing it.<sup class="footnote-marker">289</sup><i class="footnote">Take it upon yourself like an ox takes the plow, as the donkey takes the load. After all, you are not an ox! You are a man, who has the potential to be greater than an ox! It is up to you.</i> Since the tainted motive is not the source of your awakening to <i>avodah</i>, and owing to the disturbance you feel by its presence, how easy it will be for you to brush it away with no more than a sharp stare and a stern shout.

Chapter 13

<big><strong>Soul Accounting</strong></big>
Everything we can know from the pages of this book, and everything we can learn and do from the teachings of Chassidus, can only be fully realized if we take a make a hard and honest account of our soul, called in Hebrew, a “<i>cheshbon nefesh</i>.” It is the foundation of avodah in general, and of the avodah of Chassidus in particular. First, let it be clear that at certain times, a <i>cheshbon nefesh</i> is not in your better interests. We already mentioned the problems involved in making a <i>cheshbon nefesh</i> while you are engaged in prayer or Torah study. Your feel your “best davening,” and your most lucid and insightful Torah study when you are in good spirits and in agreement with God’s desires (<i>b’simchah</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">290</sup><i class="footnote">And inversely, when you are making an account of your life, you are debating whether the expression of you personal wants are for or against God’s desires. Such conflicts result in anything from annoyance to melancholy.</i> as well as when you are confident and resolved in your goals (<i>b’hischazkus</i>). It is impossible to feel such joy and confidence when you go deep inside and take an honest look at matters of the soul that you generally avoid. But just as you can’t learn or <i>daven</i> (simultaneously) with it, you also can’t learn or daven successfully without it. That is to say, a man who avoids looking at his true place in the world, bowing his head to the truth and breaking his heart over his own insincerity, cannot stand before God and speak or hear God’s word in the Torah. For this reason, man is required to take account of his soul from time to time. The holy masters have said that the best time for a cheshbon nefesh is when he is disturbed by some worry, or even in the midst of some physical or financial hardship. But if he is in a good, comfortable state of mind and body, and he just wants to incorporate a cheshbon nefesh into his avodah, then he should take care to eat and drink less. Not that he has to fast completely,<sup class="footnote-marker">291</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe actually says that he should not fast. The way of Chassidus as taught by the Holy Baal Shem Tov is against fasting and mortification of the flesh, as the power of simchah is greater than the power of tears. Of course, sadness and depression are forces of evil that needs to be fought with bravery, but there is a great difference than a broken heart and depression. A man of feeling will need to learn how to use his sensitivity, his “broken heart,” or strife of the spirit in order to feel the world and thereby take charge of his life and soul. This cannot be done in the doldrums of hopelessness where a man relinquishes his confidence and, God forbid until the redemption, accept the evils that terrorize such hope. The Gemara tells us why we fast, the halacha teaches us when, and, somewhat, how to fast, but that is not enough. Chassidus, the inner, modern message which conveys the meaning of the Torah and halacha, shows us not just the dangers of fasting or eating, or just the way to be outwardly holy, but what a man can do with his avodah to find joy and solace within all of the overwhelming reality and “emes” that he confronts. In short, it confronts the onslaught of harsh reality and transforms it into a brave and honest expression of a devoted personality by resolving his conflicts about his <i>avodah</i>. All agree that the point of fasting is not to suffer for suffering’s sake, but an external avodah to awaken an inner change for the better. Here the Rebbe is simply adding to this that, yes, the main point is not the hunger, but the positive transformation that the hunger inspires, which is just not possible without a cheshbon nefesh. <br>Rav Shloimele Z”l once said in the name of the Rebbes, “On Tisha B’av we are so broken over the destruction of the Temple, who can eat? But on Yom Kippur, it is so awesome, <i>mammash</i>, (really) who needs to eat!” (Mammash means real. The usage, “awesome, mammash” can be understood as an intense feeling of the revelation of the soul.)</i> but for a cheshbon nefesh, he needs to, at least, reach the point where his spirit and selfish desires are subdued so as to be in a willing state of mind to confront the truth.
Not a man in the midst of a cheshbon nefesh should do it in a rushed, off handed way. He should feel as if he is standing trial before the court. That is to say, he needs to reach a real awareness that his body, desires, and very soul<sup class="footnote-marker">292</sup><i class="footnote">Nefesh, Ruach, and Neshama, deepening levels of soul.</i> are all standing in judgment. They are not being judged by the Heavenly Court, but by man himself. The more honest he is in his introspection, and according to the degree to which he bows his head before the Almighty whose life is in His hands, the more the One who sits in Judgment will be lenient in His ruling. This is an explanation of what God meant when He said, “Behold I will bring you to judgment for saying, I have not sinned.”<sup class="footnote-marker">293</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu, 2:35</i> Simply put, when there is judgment below, (and man is honest with himself and his relationship to God’s Law), then there is no judgment above, (for He will suspend the sentence.) <sup class="footnote-marker">294</sup><i class="footnote">In my ignorance of Divine court procedure, I ask myself, “could the sentence sometimes be suspended conditionally, and at other times unconditionally?” But regardless of Divine calculations that are hidden from us, it seems that God said to Yirmiyahu that if we claim our innocence, He will then not only have to punish us for negligent actions, but also for lying – to God and to ourselves. However, if we judge ourselves honesty, for better or worse, we know what is incumbent upon us to do, then the Merciful Judge will suspend judgment and give us time to make amends. <br>The man is taking a candid look at himself and asking himself certain questions. The proceedings of his own evaluation require that he first confronts and accepts his true feelings so as to gain a clear view of his merits and mistakes. He asks himself where he is standing with God. “I know we all accepted the Torah, and continue to do so in every generation, but what about me? Have God and I really come to an agreement concerning … ?” And if he feels he is at all negligent, then he needs humility and bravery. He needs the humility to bow his head before the Almighty One who gives him life and the bravery to take it upon himself to mend his ways.<br>If you consider the historical context, you can clearly see why the Rebbe was writing this book with such passion. It was and still is in order to save us from punishment.</i>
Consider the greatness of God. It is impossible for man or even angels to fathom. But even if a grain of the knowledge of God’s greatness were to pass through your heart of stone for a fraction of a second, then if would be enough to melt it and return you to the fold before the Master of All.<sup class="footnote-marker">295</sup><i class="footnote">As was noted above from the Besht, with the Eternal, the Infinite, if you hold on to a part, you are holding on the whole.</i> Now that you have intensified your thoughts, apply your new found ability and contemplate all of the worlds, from the physical world (assiyah) and all of its wonders,<sup class="footnote-marker">296</sup><i class="footnote">The Rambam similarly encourages us to study biology, physics, and astronomy, as a greater appreciation of the creation will increase our love and fear of the Creator. “From my flesh I shall see God.” The Baal Shem Tov was so divinely inspired that he could look at a table or cabinet and know what the carpenter was thinking while he was making it. We are far from such heights, but we are encouraged to follow the same techniques of deep contemplation and intense thought in applications suited to our own levels and abilities.</i> to the heights of heaven and its host.<sup class="footnote-marker">297</sup><i class="footnote">“Hevei Metsits,” means, take a glimpse. Both Shlomo haMelech (see next footnote below) and Chazal used this word for contemplation of hidden matters, which could include Maase Merkava and Maase bereshit. (The mysteries of Divine conduct and the mystery of Creation). If the chassid has come this far, applying all of the advice given, he is truly, “mevin m’daato,” a wise, intelligent person, a man dedicated to keeping the Torah, and most likely wears a beard and has a wife. He may not know all of the “eybayot of Abaye and Rava,” the Rambam’s colorful expression for being expert in the Gemara, but the important thing is that he truly wants to be and fixes times for Torah study. In short, if he wants to, he can learn Kaballah. The Rebbe, a faithful guide, has been preparing the chicks to fly from the nest, and learn to fly on their own. The Rebbe as an educator teaches the Chassid to soar in the mind and soul to the inner spaces and abstract realms, all the way to the world that flows forth from Endless Infininty. But beware, Four went in and only one came out in peace. (Chagigah, 14b) It is crucial to follow the advice provided in this book with great care, as its advice is for your own safety and well-being. If the advice in this book has been adequately applied up to this point, it seems that the Avreich is ready to begin introductory contemplation of Divine spaces.</i> Take a glimpse<sup class="footnote-marker">298</sup><i class="footnote">The Shir Hashirim says, “who is that standing behind our wall, glimpsing through the cracks.” The wall is the concealment of God’s presence and the concealment of the soul. God sees his servants who truly love and fear him “glimpsing” at what they largely cannot see. There is a way to truly to feel and see these worlds if we bear in mind that it is only an impression on our souls and minds in the lower realms that shows us what is going on above.</i> beyond with your inspired and holy imagination. Envision the world of yetsirah (formation) and its angels, the world of <i>beriyah</i> (creation) and its heavenly thrones, up to the world of <i>atsilus</i> (emanation from the Infinite) and its holy sefiros. In these realms, the souls of the Patriarchs, the prophets, and the Sages, the masters of Kabbalah and Chassidus – all of the Tsaddikim – are all nullified in a state of holy <i>bittul</i> before the All-Powerful, the Holy and Exaulted One, the One above all blessing and praise, who fills all of the worlds and surrounds all of the worlds, the Eternal and the Endless. There they serve Him, singing praises to His great Name. And in contemplating this, I look at myself in relation to the holy souls and spaces. Even though I am the smallest of the small, I own up to my own impunity in throwing the yoke off of my neck and rebelling against His wishes. How could I have been so brazen, so unabashedly shameful as to do this before God’s presence, and before all of His Tsaddikim, holy souls, and holy angels?
Think about all of your mistakes and indiscretions, your abuses of the Law as well as your fellow man’s trust, your lashon ha’rah and your tale-bearing, your flattery and your lies. Think about your low thoughts and desires. Think about the jumble of thoughts messing up your <i>tefillah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">299</sup><i class="footnote">Some examples might be blessing ha’eyts on a cookie, standing amidah saying birchat hamazon, or even carelessly slurring the words of the tefillah, or thinking about other matters during davening.</i> Now turn to consider the numerous fasts that the Ari z”l proscribed as a rectification for transgressions, sometimes requiring hundreds of days of fasting.<sup class="footnote-marker">300</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe Zts”l is referring to the Sha’ar Ruach HaKodesh of the Arizal, which prescribes a specific number of fast days for each transgression in question.</i> Yet due to the weakness of our generation, the Baal Shem Tov and other Tsaddikim have been lenient with us, telling us that we don’t need to fast, but can do teshuvah by means of fixing our middos, learning, and davening with a full heart, a willing soul, with love, and with awe.<sup class="footnote-marker">301</sup><i class="footnote">The Sefer Baal Shem Tov (a collection of the Besht’s teachings taken from 210 different Chasidishe sefarim) tells us that every time you immerse in the mikveh it is considered as if you had fasted. (This does not include waving your hand in and out of the water during one immersion, but that is just my opinion.) Another teaching tells us that the Chassidim of the Besht once asked him why he didn’t prescribe penitential fasts and mortifications of the flesh like the Tsaddikim of previous generations. He answered, “I came into the world to teach three kinds of love – the love of God, the love of Torah, and the love of the people Israel. With all of this love, who needs to fast!”</i> We may not have to fast, but integral to our present <i>teshuvah</i> is the same nullification of ego and broken spirit that was part and parcel of the fasts of our predecessors.
Brood and even cry in this way until you have truly broken your heart and your spirit within you. Say Tehillim. Beg God to be kind and forgiving, to be merciful with you. You cry out to Him and you say, “don’t to cast you away from Your holy presence, but rather bring me close to You.” Then make yourself strong and believe that God indeed accepts your teshuvah, and brings you close to Him. Earlier we explained that we are confident that God forgives us because the Law itself tells us to bless God as, “the merciful One who is great in forgiveness.” Surely He would not want us to say an unwarranted blessing, so it must be that He indeed forgives us.
These are specific times that you have set aside for a particularly intense cheshbon nefesh, but at all other times, don’t fancy yourself a Tsaddik, clean from any hint of sin. Then, too, remember that you have many faults and character defects, and you need to take care of them. The difference between these two times is that at the time you have allocated for an intense cheshbon nefesh, the sins you have committed are right there before you, and you feel tremendous bitterness and regret over them. But at other times, you admit that you did them, but they don’t have the poignant immediacy that they do at the time of the cheshbon nefesh. You know in general that you made mistakes, and as you bow your head you admit that you have much to learn, but you don’t have to go into your mistakes with fine detail and cry over each one as you would in the midst of a cheshbon nefesh. The Iggeros HaTeshuvah of the first Lubavitcher Rebbe interprets the verse, “and my sin is before me always,” “before me, but separated by a distance.” The word in the Tehillim for “before me,” is, “<i>negdi</i>,” which also appears in the description of how the twelve tribes encamped around the Tabernacle in the wilderness, “they shall camp far (<i>mineged</i>) from the tent of meeting.”<sup class="footnote-marker">302</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar, 2:2 see Rashi.</i> The point is that although one always needs to be aware of his sins, still, they are to be kept at a reasonable distance except at a time of <i>cheshbon nefesh</i>.
This “comfortable distance” is only for the sins that you have transgressed, but it is not for you other failings and character flaws, which need to be tackled more frequently. In order to correct and heal your flaws you must confront them with honesty and without deceiving yourself.<sup class="footnote-marker">303</sup><i class="footnote">At times you may have to give yourself the “third degree,” meaning confronting your bad behavior with brutal honesty.</i> The sickness of the soul should be no less crucial an agenda as the sickness of the body, but also needs constant attention and a thorough regiment of care in the quest for spiritual and behavioral health. Therefore, my dear Bachur and Avreich, since you have at least begun to strengthen your mind in the way of intense thought, then you should take your newly acquired abilities and direct them to your personal failings and character flaws. Don’t push aside even the slightest defects, but rather go deeply into all of them and find a viable way and concrete method with which to correct them. Haven’t you found yourself time and time again making resolutions to cease from doing this action or thinking this thought, only to soon find yourself doing and thinking it yet again? Perhaps deep inside yourself there is a hidden reason that causes you to do it. If you excavate your soul down to the bedrock, you may find that when the cause is discovered, you can take action against it and thereby heal yourself.
Most importantly, don’t try do justify your behavior all the time. Instead, look at your behavior like a true judge, and be greatly concerned about their evils and deficiencies.
In summary, we have provided you with three modalities for three different situations.
The first is when you are engaged in the study of Torah, davening, or any other avodah for the Almighty. At these times you shouldn’t be making a cheshbon nefesh, but rather are encouraged to feel simchah, yearning, desire for God, hislahavus or hisragshus. At very least you should give yourself over to the words of the prayer and to the avodah in the ways that we have mentioned.
The second modality is at the time of a cheshbon nefesh, when your spirit is crushed within you.
The third modality takes effect at every other time, not during times devoted to Torah or prayer, and not at times of a cheshbon nefesh. Then you are well to being subdued and humble as the dust, but nonetheless joyous, with strength of resolve and confidence. Know that you have many failings and think about how to fix them. Put your trust in God, since you are serving Him with all of your strength, and there are many times that you are immersed in teshuvah and avodah with maximum effort. This being so, in the merit of the Patriarchs and the Tsaddikim God will be merciful and gracious with you, bringing you close both now and in the future. One of the wonders of the Baal Shem Tov and his students, and his student’s students, is the novel concept that two divergent middos could be won by the heart that yearns for them – humility and meekness, together with confidence and joy, meaning true simchah, , “I shall greatly rejoice in God, my soul shall be joyful in Hashem.”<sup class="footnote-marker">304</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu, 61:10</i> Hashem is God, and you, Yisrael, are His son, His loved one, and His servant. Your deficiencies are not like the deficiencies of crude men, despicable rouges who might as well be rolling around in the garbage, but are like the deficiencies of the son of the king, where no matter what faults he has or mistakes he has made, he is still the son of the king. And when he only picks himself up and puts all of his heart and soul into serving his father, then to whom can he be compared and who can measure his awesome heights? When the prince gives himself over to the serving and honoring his father, then the intensity of his closeness and cleaving to his father the King is without end and without measure.

Chapter 14

<big><strong>Kriyas Shema.</strong></big>
“And you who are cleaving to Hashem your God are all alive today.”<sup class="footnote-marker">305</sup><i class="footnote">Devarim, 4.</i>
The Gemara<sup class="footnote-marker">306</sup><i class="footnote">Sanhedrin, 64a</i> tells us that the word, “cleaving (<i>d’veikim</i>)” means an intensely close connection.<sup class="footnote-marker">307</sup><i class="footnote">“Devekus” is the act of joining and uniting oneself with God. It could be described as an intense feeling of connection to God. Man indeed has the ability to unite with the Omnipresent, each at his own level, and reaching a state of deveikus is one of the primary goals of Avodas Hashem. In order to understand the phenomenon, the Rebbe points us first to the way Chazal used the term deveikus. It is not simply being close together, like a lid tightly fastened to a jar that can be removed with little effort, but in the imagery of the Gemara, “like two date palms that grew together.” wedged together, inseparable. It is the difference between a mere association and a long standing relationship where the two grew together, like a man and wife or a child and parent. When you achieve devekus you cannot be taken away from God, or even distracted from being conscious of His presence.</i> The Toldos Yaakov Yosef<sup class="footnote-marker">308</sup><i class="footnote">Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye, the “top student” of the Baal Shem Tov, published in 1780 (5540) the first sefer to quote teachings of his master Rabbi Yisrael.</i> tells us in the name of the Rambam that the ultimate purpose of Torah observance is for man to reach the point where he fulfills the words, “and you shall cleave unto Him,” in all aspects of his Torah observance. With this in mind, we can understand how the teachings of Chassidus are not an optional avodah that the man of Israel can “get by” without. It is the central point of the Torah - its very culmination - and without it, man’s Torah observance is somehow incomplete.<sup class="footnote-marker">309</sup><i class="footnote">Deveikus happens when there is a harmony and union between your desires and God’s desire. You can reach deveikus in learning and in davening, but it must be clear that an <i>eved Hashem</i> can reach deveikus in the performance of just about any commandment. Those who know little about Chassidus might have an image in their minds of Chassidim reaching deveikus by davening, singing, and dancing for long periods of time. Though Chassidus stresses avodah b’simcha, still, being a chassid does not mean dancing around and clapping your hands, “drinking l’chaims” and davening late. A chassid is a baal nefesh, and once in possession of your soul you yearn to cleave it to the source of all souls in everything you do.</i> How is it possible to truly cleave God through avodah if that service is done without soul, or with a soul that is covered up, or with a soul that you have not yet mastered? One can only reach <i>deveikus</i> (intense closeness or cleaving) through the avodah of Chassidus through some mastery of a revealed soul. Once you succeed in revealing your soul you can then truly feel <i>deveikus</i> with Hashem, each according to his own level. There is a concept and practice of <i>mesiras nefesh</i> in avodah. <i>Mesiras nefesh</i> means delivering over of your whole soul in any service of God, as we mentioned in Chapter Five when we quoted the <b>Beis Aharon</b>.<sup class="footnote-marker">310</sup><i class="footnote">Rav Aharon of Karlin, a generation after the Baal Shem Tov.</i> When a man, God forbid, comes to a trial of faith at the hands of the oppressor, then he must relinquish himself in martyrdom and allow the destruction of his body and his life. It is only under highly rare conditions that we are asked to deliver our very lives to the <i>avodah</i>. And yet, every day, we have the ability to deliver our souls. For this reason it is called <i>mesiras nefesh</i>, (relinquishing the soul) and not <i>mesiras hagoof</i> (relinquishing the body). <i>Mesiras nefesh</i> is done when man’s desire, thoughts, behavior, and body are whole-heartedly offered to God in the context of the <i>avodah</i>. With the work of days and years, the <i>eved Hashem</i> directs all of his energies into the avodah. In this way he is really giving himself over to God. He still lives and walks the earth, but still, he delivers his body, soul, and all of his powers to God. After days and years pass he attains greater levels of devotion, until he reaches a point where he puts his life and soul<sup class="footnote-marker">311</sup><i class="footnote">Here, as in many other places, the Rebbe Zts”l says, nefesh, ruach, and neshama, which we call, “soul.”</i> into every act of kindness, every tefillah, and every line of Torah, every moment of the day. In his very lifetime he is wholly given over into God’s hands. And then, “at a time when God is found,”<sup class="footnote-marker">312</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim, 32:6. “a time when God is found … Rav Nachman bar Yitschak says, this is when one passes on.” (Gemara, Brachos 8a)</i> after the length of days and years, he is then altogether given over to God.
The Law requires that you keep certain things in mind when you say the Shema.<sup class="footnote-marker">313</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the Unity of God, acceptance of the responsibility of the Torah, acceptance of the responsibility placed on us by the Sovereignty of Heaven.</i> One of them is mesiras nefesh to the Master of All. Heartfelt mesiras Nefesh during the declaration of Shema is not an obligation that only takes effect if an Israelite is faced with martytdom, God forbid, and forced to surrender his life at the hands of his oppressor.<sup class="footnote-marker">314</sup><i class="footnote">See Sanhedrin, 72b</i> Even though you are not faced with such a trial, still, you strive to fulfill the mitzvah of Shema with all of your heart and soul. Far be it that the mesiras nefesh we offer during Krias Shema is a mere lip service - a dutiful thought as brief and superficial a passing shadow. The Holy Baal Shem Tov tells us that where a man’s thoughts are, there you find the entire man. So when you use your ability of intense thought and envision a pillar of fire before you, and you throw yourself in the fire in the sanctification of God’s name, then you really are in the place of your thoughts. You really do throw yourself into the inferno. I saw a hint of this in a commentary on the verse, “we are reckoned as sheep for the slaughter.”<sup class="footnote-marker">315</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim, 44”23</i> It is not only that others thought about us this way. The verse uses the word thought, or considered, to show how we can consider ourselves as offerings. But it is no loose consideration. When we use the power of our minds and intense contemplation to deliver over our souls, then for all intensive purposes, we are sheep for the slaughter, and really do give over our physical lives for God.
<i>Mesiras nefesh</i> during <i>kriyat shema</i> needs to reach a level of intensity where we surrender ourselves to God in total. It is a complete act of submission to God, where you relinquish all of your physical and spiritual powers to the avodah, with the full awareness that you will in this way be given over to the service of God all the days of your life. You then exemplify what God had in mind when He said, “and you who are cleaving to Hashem, your God, are all alive today,” - “truly cleaving.”<sup class="footnote-marker">316</sup><i class="footnote">From the Gemara, Sanhedrin, 64a, mentioned above.</i> When you see yourself giving up your life for the sake of God, subduing and delivering your whole being and life to the Blessed One, it will make it much easier for you to dedicate yourself to the details of day to day <i>avodah</i>, for the length of days and years with the life that God grants you. This is what the Holy Rebbes meant when they said,<sup class="footnote-marker">317</sup><i class="footnote">Or, in the vernacular, “as it is brought down in holy seforim…”</i> “If a man says the morning Krias Shema with clear intent, then his avodas Hashem will be successful for the rest of the day.”
This only happens when we are aware of the deep and concentrated purpose of <i>Mesiras nefesh</i> while saying the Shema, with enough power to subdue our bodies and souls to God’s way, but not when the intention is dutiful but unthinking, like a shadow flashing across the wall. Let us see if your intentions are sincere and your <i>mesiras nefesh</i> during the recitation of the Shema is indeed heartfelt. You may have the intention of mesiras nefesh three times a day, but how do you evaluate the seriousness of your intentions? Try saying out loud, “I am hereby ready to be burned in fire before God.” You may find that it is difficult for you to say at first.<sup class="footnote-marker">318</sup><i class="footnote">If so, then your thoughts are not yet completely honest to the point where your thoughts hold the force of reality, as was mentioned above from the Baal Shem Tov.</i> If it is so hard to even say the words, then how much more difficult would it be for you to actually do!
Therefore, in the morning, before davening, say the following out loud, with seriousness of intent and intensity of thought:
With a full heart, I hereby accept upon myself the yoke and responsibility of the sovereignty of heaven.
I truly believe that only God exists, that all of the worlds and all of existence are an illumination of Godliness, that He brought forth<sup class="footnote-marker">319</sup><i class="footnote">See Bamidbar, 11:17. “He’etsil,” means bringing forth anything from the source, where the source is not in any way lacking when it gives from itself, just as a candle can light any number of other candles without loosing any of its own fire, or a wise man could teach any number of students without depleting his own knowledge. The Kabbalists call this, “atsilut,” or the emenation of light from the light of the Infinite (Ayn Sof).</i> and created them all, managing them down to the last detail<sup class="footnote-marker">320</sup><i class="footnote">Hashgacha pratis.</i> under His careful scrutiny and according to His good desire.
I hereby, surrender, subdue, and nullify<sup class="footnote-marker">321</sup><i class="footnote">“Bittul” is a state of being whereby man relinquishes his personal wants and needs and becomes transformed into a vessel for God’s desire. It in no way implies that a man feels worthless or devoid of self esteem, but rather his desire to serve God in the path of Chazal is so great that he puts personal comfort aside in pursuit of the goal of being a worthy servant. A man in a state of bittul is not cowering in a state of terror before the all powerful, but a dignified and noble servant of the Almighty. He is a man of strength and restraint, but more importantly, he has a deep appreciation of the awesome majesty of God and His Torah. A simple example of bittul would be washing the dishes for your wife even if you would much rather see your friends or learn your Gemara. Bittul before the Torah is achieved by doing a mitzvah even when you have no urge to do so, or following the directions of your Rav even if you feel that it they are contrary to your own desires and opinions. When you accept that Chazal’s wisdom is much greater than your own, and in accepting that they simply knew better you adhere to their words, you are beginning to understand the concept of bittul. It is a noble and praiseworthy attribute.</i> my body, nefesh, ruach, and neshama from this moment onward, to God, This includes my desires, thoughts, speech and actions. It remains in force while I am sleeping and while I am awake. At no moment shall any facet of my being go against God’s will, God forbid. My soul, mind, body, emotion, speech and actions will only be vessels for the fulfillment of God’s will and desires.
I am hereby willing to give over my body to be burned for the sake of God’s glory and honor, and I hereby accept upon myself the yoke and responsibility of the sovereignty of Heaven with absolute truth.




Don’t just say the words. Actually mean what you say. Since you are already traveling on the path of expanded and intensified thought, your words will reach the heart of the matter, and will indeed be substantial.
God fills the whole world with His glory, and you actually subdue, surrender and nullify your entire self and being before God.<sup class="footnote-marker">322</sup><i class="footnote">Like a candle in the bonfire, and a bonfire in the midst of the sun.</i> On the strength of this thought and to the extent with which your actually surrender yourself before Him, you may even find yourself bending and bowing before the Sovereign of all Sovereigns, the King of all Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.
The fire rages, the flames blaze, and you jump into the fiery hearts and tongues for the sake of the Glory of God’s Sovereignty, may He be blessed.
Don’t start saying the Shema right away. Pause for a few moments. Think about the words that you are about to say and the intentions that you have in saying them. Then think to yourself that you are about to actually say the Shema Yisrael. In doing so you <i>crown</i> Hashem as the Sovereign Ruler over yourself and the entire universe.
After these thoughts and declarations, say the Shema. Use your faculty of intense thought to crown God as ruler of the heavens, (and then you may turn your head heavenward),<sup class="footnote-marker">323</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe Zts”l is suggesting these motions, mentioned in the Halacha, but it might be noted that such motions are not obligatory.</i> Ruler of the earth (and you may bend your neck and lower your head), and Ruler of the four directions of the earth (and you may turn your head in a circle).<sup class="footnote-marker">324</sup><i class="footnote">See Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim, Siman 61, seif 6)</i> Then extend the word, echad (one),<sup class="footnote-marker">325</sup><i class="footnote">Based on the Tikkunei Zohar, six times the amount of times it would normally take to say it.</i> drawing it out with your voice and thinking that your own willingness to give yourself over completely in the act of <i>mesiras nefesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">326</sup><i class="footnote">The Rebbe just says, “have in mind the mesiras nefesh when you say echad.” The Holy Zohar teaches us that God, The Torah, and Knesset Yisrael (the Community of Israel or the Shechina) are all one. Therefore, in giving yourself over to God, you are also giving yourself over to the Torah and Israel. And when you help another Jew, you are also giving yourself over to God and the Torah to the degree with which you help him.</i>
After you say keriyas Shema in this way you will indeed be a changed man. Your davening, your learning of Torah, and your avodas Hashem will all reach a greater level of refinement. As you go about your day, you will not quite be the same – not nearly. Of course you shouldn’t use this meditation, this intense structure of thought every day, for we have already learned from the <b>Maor VaShemesh</b> that a tactic that is used too often loses its potency.<sup class="footnote-marker">327</sup><i class="footnote">And it seems that the more potent the tactic, the more quickly it will loose its potency, because our minds can only take so much. It is a question of spiritual pharmaceutics.</i> Only do this intense thought three times a week, on Shabbos, and two other days that you deem necessary, and feel able to do it justice.
May God have mercy upon us.
May He bring us close to Him, in body and soul. May (our avodah) expand,<sup class="footnote-marker">328</sup><i class="footnote">“mitoch harchava.” May we have a greater ability to serve Him. And similarly we bless God to widen the revelation of His goodness in our lives.</i>
(and in His great love for us) may He bring salvation and consolation,
revealing His benevolence in the world.
May we merit the complete redemption soon and in our days, Amen.
