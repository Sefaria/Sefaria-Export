Rosh Hashanah

"In distress I called on Yah; Yah answered me and brought me relief"; "Hear my plea; Do not shut Your ear to my groan, to my cry."
In Midrash Kohelet [Kohelet Rabbah] 8, "Rabbi Mona of Shaab and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi interpreted the verse as regarding Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur. This is analogous to a province that owed taxes to the king. The king dispatched a tax collector from the treasury to collect it. [When he was] at a distance of ten mil, the prominent leaders of the province emerged and lauded him, and he forgave one-third for them. At a distance of five mil, the middling ones emerged and lauded him, and he forgave one-third for them. When he neared [and was right outside the province], men, women, and children emerged to greet him, and he forgave it in its entirety, etc."
