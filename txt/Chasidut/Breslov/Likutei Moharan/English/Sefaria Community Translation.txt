Torah 1



Section 1

Happy are the ones on the wholehearted path, who walk in HaShem's Torah. (Psalms 119:1)
Acknowledge because by way of the Torah all prayers and requests  that we request and pray are accepted.  And Yisrael's favor and importance are raised and elevated before whoever they need whether spiritually or materialistically.
Because now in our many transgressions Yisrael's real favor and importance descended, because now the importance and favor are mainly by them, but through the Torah Yisrael's favor and importance are raised because the Torah is called (Proverbs 5) AYeLeT AHaVIM VYAALaT HeN/Favor, that raises/SHeiMAALaH HeN/favor upon her studiers (Eruvin 54b); through this all prayers and requests are raised.

Section 2

The Jewish man needs to constantly look at (pay attention to) the intelligence (in other words meaning, or possibly spirituality) that is [surely in] everything. He must do this in order so the intelligence found in EVERYTHING will enlighten him to become closer to Hashem Yisborach through the very thing in which he see the intelligence.

Section 1


Since each person must say, "The whole world was only created for my sake" (Sanhedrin 37a), it comes out that when the world is created for my sake, I must see and search at all times for the rectification of the world, to fill the lacks in the world and to pray for them.

Torah 6



Section 1

Verbatim from Rabeinu of blessed memory: "And the LORD said to Moses... call Joshua..." (Deuteronomy 31:14).
Such that every man needs to minimize his honor and to maximize the honor of 'the place' (the LORD). Since one that pursues honor does not attain "the honor of Elokim", but rather the "honor of kings" as it says, "the honor of kings is to investigate a matter", and everyone investigates after him and they ask, "who is this one, and what of him that he divides to himself this honor", and they oppose on him, such that they say that he is not worthy for this honor.

Section 1

(This is the exact language of our Rebbe, may his memory be for a blessing). "The depths covered them, they sank like rocks...". 
For the main element of life-force is received from prayer, as it is written, "A Prayer to the God of my Life." Therefore, a person must pray with all of their power, for when a person prays with all of their power, and puts their power into the letters of the prayer, then their power is renewed there, in the aspect of "they are renewed in the morning, great is your faithfulness." For faith is [also] prayer, as it is written, "and his hands were steady," which [Onkelos] translates as, "they were spread in prayer."

Section 2

And know, that there are twelve tribes, corresponding to the twelve constellations of the Zodiac. Every tribe has its own unique liturgy (nusach), and their own unique gate through which their prayers enter, and each tribe awakens through their prayer the power of their particular constellation of the twelve in the zodiac, and their constellation shines back down and causes vegetation to grow, along with whatever else is needed.
And this is the explanation of, "A star emerges from Jacob, a tribe stands up out of Israel." "Stands up" - this is the aspect of Amidah (standing), the aspect of prayer; for when a Jew stands in prayer, through this it awakens the star, and the star encourages and forces things to grow, as the sages have said: there is no blade of grass below that does not have its own star and angel above, that strike it and say to it: Grow!

Section 1


To draw down full and complete providence is impossible until you have broken the lust for money. And breaking it is through “tzedaka”. 
For it says in the Zohar (Pinchas 224) “A spirit/wind comes down to cool the heat of the heart, and when the spirit comes down, the heart receives it with the joy of the melody of the Levites.” 
“Spirit/wind”—this is of the aspect of tzedaka, which is the spirit of generosity, through which the heat of the lust for money is cooled. And this is of the aspect of (Tehilim 76) (He will) contain the spirit of the powerful”—that the spirit diminishes the lust for power and money. 
“The melody of the Levites”—this is the aspect of transaction in (good) faith, where one is not in a hurry to become wealthy. For melody is transaction, as it is written (Tehilim 81) “Take up the melody and sound the timbrel.” “Joy” is he who is happy with his portion. 
And this is of the aspect of incense, which  connects the heating of the heart with the spirit, and this is (Proverbs 27) Incense will gladden the heart” and this is (Deuteronomy 33) “They will put incense in your brow,” that through the aspect of incense as we have mentioned, the aspect of “By the sweat of your brow you will eat bread” will be nullified.  
And this is the aspect of the revelation of the Messiah, for then the desire of money will be nullified, as it says (Isaiah 2) “On that day Man will toss way his gods of silver and gods of gold.” And this is of the aspect (Lamentations 4) of “The breath of our nostrils, the messiah of the Lord.” 
And as long as there is the idolatry of money in the world, there is anger in the world, and to the extent that there is a nullification of this idolatry then the anger will be nullified, in the aspect of "The wind (spirit) of his nostrils, the Messiah of the Lord," and loving-kindness will be drawn into the world, of the aspect "and (He) performs loving-kindness for his anointed one (Psalms 18). 
And when this Love is revealed, knowledge is drawn down, which is the building of the house, which is of the aspect of "And I, through your great loving-kindness, will come into Your house, as is written in the Zohar, "This right-hand (love) will in the future build the Holy Temple. For knowledge is of the same aspect as house, as our sages said (Tractate Brachot 33) Whoever has knowledge, it is as if the Holy Temple was built in his days.

Section 1

The words of our Rabbi, may his memory be for a blessing. [Aramaic left untranslated]

Know, that there is a soul in the world, that by its hand are discovered (revealed) the interpretations and explanations of the Torah. And she suffers with pangs, bread eaten with salt, and water drunk with small measure, because such is the path of the Torah. (Pirkei Avot 6:4). And all of the interpretations of the Torah are received from that soul. 
And this soul, all of its words are like fiery coals, because you cannot receive and draw from the waters of Torah, except he whose  words are like fiery coals as in the aspect of, "Are my words not like fire?" (Jeremiah 23:29). 
And when this soul falls, in the aspect of "are my words not like fire?", and its words are not like fiery coals, and its words are cold - then it dies (out). And when the interpretations of the Torah die out and continues by its hand, and then all the interpreters of the Torah cannot achieve any interpretations (illuminations) of the Torah. 

Section 2

And he who wants to continue in the interpretations of the Torah, must, from the beginning, continue saying to himself warm things, like coals of fire. And the words continue [out] from the upper [supernal] heart, in the aspect of "the rock of my heart" (Psalms 73:26). And he must pour out his words [speech] in prayer before Hashem Yisbarach, and by his prayer receives the pity of the mercy of Hashem Yisbarach on him, and his upper [supernal] heart opens, because the essence of mercy is in the heart, and there will be an outpouring of words from his upper [supernal] heart, and by the words he will continue in the interpretations of the Torah also from there. 
And "heart" is the aspect of "selah" (rock), that from there the speech, in the aspect of "words in rock" ([Talmud] Megillah 18). And selah (rock) is the aspect of tzur (rock, flint), as in the aspect of "He opened a rock and the waters gushed out" (Psalms 105:41), and this is the aspect of "lev" (heart), in the aspect of "the rock of my heart". 
And the heart is pitied in mercy, and impacts the hot speech, as in the aspect of "My heart grew hot within me; a fire blazed in my thoughts; then I spoke out with my tongue" (Psalms 39:4). And in this heart is written all explanations (interpretations) of the Torah, as in the aspect of "Write them on the tablet of your heart". (Proverbs 3:3). 
And he who wants to take some explanation, needs to take it from the heart in prayer and supplication. And for this, every commentator of the Torah, before beginning to explain some interpretation, he must at the beginning pour out his prayer before Hashem Yisbarach, in order to arouse the upper [supernal] heart, to bestow upon him speech like fiery coals. And after that, he begins to interpret, because after that the rock is open and its water flows from it. These are the interpretations of the Torah.

Section 1

Who is the man that desires life? Loves days to see good? (Psalms 34) 
A basic spiritual foundation: One must seek peace. There should be peace between Israel. There should be peace between an individual and his distinct characteristics. That is to say, one should not be divided in his characteristics. And in all a persons various experiences, he should not distinguish between the good and the bad. Rather he should find within all experiences Hashem, may He be blessed. That is, “In Hashem I will say a word of praise; in Elokim I will say a word of praise” (Psalms 56). 
To the extent that one may find Hashem, may he be blessed in the good and the bad, and by means of the Torah which is called shalom, as it is written, “All its paths are peace” (Proverbs 3), and by means of the Tzaddikim/Righteous/Saints who are similarly called a “covenant of peace”, on account of all of this, one can love peace in any place, whether good or bad, and may be peace between Israel, and one may love the other.

Rabbi Chananya ben Chakhinai says: One who stays awake at night, and one who wanders on a road alone, and one who turns his heart to idleness, such a one is liable for [forfeiture of] his life. (Pirkei Avot 3:4)
But really they open their mouths for foolishness, because the world is possible reality, 
for only HaShem is blessed with reality, but all the worlds with all that are in them they are possible realities, for he is blessed and created it from nothing, and in his ability and his strength and his possibilities he was blessed to create or not to create, certainly all the world is a possible reality.

Section 1

<b>"Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I might show these signs of Mine before him, in order that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son’s son, what things I have done in Egypt, and My signs which I have done among them, that you may know that I am the Lord.' ...tomorrow I shall bring locusts into your borders."  </b> (Exodus 10:1-4) <br>1. 
The Holy One, Blessed be He, created the world in His compassion, wanting to express His compassion - were there no world, to whom would He show compassion? Therefore He created all of creation, from the highest levels of emanation to the most central point of the physical world, in order to show his compassion. 
Yet when He wanted to create the world, there was no space for its creation, since everything was infinite <i>ein sof</i>. He therefore had to retract the light to the sides, and from this retraction an empty void was formed. It was in this empty void that he created time and space, and this was the creation of the world. 
This empty void was necessary for creation, since without it there would be no space for the world. Yet this [concept of] retraction to form the empty void is impossible to comprehend in our time, only at the end of days, since it entails a paradox of two opposites: presence and absence. 
Since He retracted His divine nature from the void, it is as if there is no divinity there, otherwise it could not be empty, and it would just be complete <i>ein sof</i> with no room for the world. But the deeper truth is that nonetheless, there certainly is divinity even there, because nothing exists without His vitality. As such, [the concept of] the empty void is incomprehensible until future time.

Section 2

2. Know this: there are two kinds of heresy. The first kind derives from secular science, and about it the sages have said "Know how to respond to the heretic." (Avot 2:14). This heresy has a response, because it derives from the debris of the broken vessels. As we know, the [original] light [of creation] was too intense and broke the vessels, from which the <i>klippot</i> were formed. Secular science derives from here, from the broken vessels and the surplus of holiness. 
Just as man has all kinds of surplus parts, like nails, hair or sweat, each of the sciences derives from a different surplus and residue of holiness, and sorcery also derives from this source. 
Someone who falls into this kind of heresy, even though they should obviously try and escape from such a place; in any case, they can be saved, because in such places one can still find the Holy One, if one seeks Him out, since they derive from the broken vessels which contain a certain amount of holy sparks and divine letters. Therefore, anyone who falls into such a place can still find godliness and the wisdom to resolve the challenges such heretical science presents. Seeing as secular science derives from the surplus of holiness and contains divine vitality, this kind of heresy has a response, and therefore the sages were able to say "Know how to respond to the heretic." 
There exists, however, another kind of heresy, which consists of types of 'wisdom' which are not wisdom at all, but since they are deep and cannot be comprehended, they seem to be wisdom. For instance, when one makes a false reasoning in the study of Talmud and no one is learned enough to resolve the challenges arising from such reasoning - even though it actually isn't reasoning at all! 
For several of the theories have embarrassing flaws and are not wisdom at all, and all their challenges are fundamentally mistaken, but the human intellect can't resolve them and they therefore appear to be wisdom. 
Actually, these heretical challenges really can't be resolved because they derive from the empty void, and the empty void seems to be devoid of divinity. Any response to these challenges is tantamount to finding the Holy One within them, and this is absolutely impossible, since in such a case the void would not be empty and everything would be <i>ein sof</i>, as we have shown. 
Therefore it is written of this kind of heresy, "All who go there do not return," (Proverbs 2:19), since there is no possible response (<i>teshuva</i>, which can also mean 'return') to this heresy, as it comes from the empty void formed by the retraction of His divinity. 
Yet Israel, by virtue of their faith, transcend all kinds of wisdom, and even over the heresy of the void, and don't engage in any kind of rational research, but have perfect faith in the Holy One, 
who "fills all the worlds and surrounds all the worlds." (Ra'aya Meheimana 225). Since he seemingly both fills the worlds and surrounds them, there must be a space between the filling and the surrounding, otherwise everything would be one. The world was created within the empty void, from which He seemingly retracted Himself, 
and the Holy One who surrounds all worlds also surrounds the empty void, and therefore it is said that he fills all worlds (creation) and surrounds all worlds, and in between there is an empty gap seemingly absent of Him. 
Yet the empty void was also created from His holy wisdom, and certainly it truly does contain divinity which cannot be comprehended. Therefore Israel transcend all such heretical wisdoms and challenges, knowing that they can't be responded to, since doing so would destroy the empty void and the created world would not be able to exist. 
Yet the deep truth is that there is a response and there certainly truly is divinity within the void, but examining such things leads one to sink deep down, because it looks like the Holy One is absent from within. Israel, though, has faith in the Holy One who surrounds and fills all the worlds, 
and this is why they are called Hebrews, <i>Ivrim</i>, because their faith transcends (<i>'ovrim</i>) all these wisdoms, even the second kind. 
As such, the Holy One is called "God of the Hebrews," (Exodus 3:18), like "Beyond the river" (Joshua 24:2), [the word <i>'ever</i>] refers to the sides, since He retracted His light to the sides, and this is why Israel is also called Hebrews because of their faith in the Holy One, by which they transcend the wisdoms of the first kind of heresy and the non-wisdoms of the second. 
Consequently, one must certainly be extremely cautious of this second kind of heresy, keeping far from it and not examining it at all, since that would lead to sinking in it, God forbid, as it says "All who go there do not return."

Section 3

3. Know this: in fact, a great <i>Tzaddik</i>, one on the level of Moses, actually must engage with such heresy, even though it is impossible to resolve it, as we have seen. Be that as it may, by his engagement there he manages to raise such souls that have fallen and sunk in this heresy. The challenges and difficulties of such heresy coming from the empty void have the aspect of silence, since they are not associated with [divine] letters or thought. 
"By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host by the breath of His mouth." (Psalms 33:6), and there is wisdom in all speech, since speech come from the five parts of the mouth (two sets of teeth, two lips and the tongue), and through them were all things and words of creation formed, as it says "You created all in wisdom" (Psalms 104:24). 
Speech is the limit of all things, since He limited his [infinite] wisdom by means of letters, each combination of letters being a boundary to something else. However, the empty void is utterly empty of everything, even letters. Thus all the challenges coming from such a place have the aspect of silence. 
We learn in the story of Moses enquiring after the death of Rabbi Akiva, "He asked 'Is this Torah, and is this its reward?', and was told 'Silence! This has been decided!'" (Menahot 29b). He was told to stay silent, not to respond or confront such a question, since it is one that has been decided (<i>ala bamachshava</i>, literally means 'risen up in thought'), it has risen to the level of thought, where there is no speech. These questions, therefore, are ones of silence, and all one can do is have faith and remain silent, 
and none are permitted to engage with such heresies except for a true <i>Tzaddik</i>, who is similar to Moses, since Moses is of the aspect of silence and was described as "heavy of the mouth" (Exodus 4:10). Such silence is higher than speech, 
and it is because of this that a true <i>Tzaddik</i> like Moses can engage in these challenges, which are also of the aspect of silence - indeed, they must engage in such things in order to raise the souls of those who have fallen in there.

Section 4

4. Know this: dispute is like the creation of the world. The essence of the creation of the world is the empty void, as we have shown, without which everything would be <i>ein sof</i>, with no space for the world to be created in. Therefore He retracted the light to the sides, forming an empty void, within which He created all of creation - time and space - using speech. (As it says: "The heavens were created by the word of the LORD" [Psalms 33:6].) 
This holds the aspect of dispute, for if all the wise scholars were one, there would be no space for creation. Only through the dispute between them - in which they separate from each other and each distances himself a different side - they create between them something similar to the empty void, and they are like the light retracting to the sides, through which the world was able to be created. 
For all the words they use are ultimately only for the creation of the world created in the void between them. Wise scholars create everything through their speech, as it says: "Say to Zion, you are my people." (Isaiah 51:16), and we are told not to read <i>ami</i> 'my people' but rather <i>imi</i> 'with me' - just as I create heaven and earth with words, so do you. (Tikkunei Zohar, Intro. 5). 
Still, one must be careful not to speak too much, only as much as is needed to create the world and no more. Because it was the over-abundance of light, which the vessels could not take, that cracked them, and from their shards the <i>klippot</i> were created. So too with speech: too much speech creates <i>klippot</i> through the over-abundance of light. <br>This is the meaning of the Mishna (Avot 1:17): "I spent my days growing up between the scholars, and found nothing good for the body but silence. The exposition [of Torah] is not what is essential, but deeds. And whoever increases words brings sin." "Between the scholars" - this refers to the empty void formed through the dispute and distancing between scholars. Therefore it specifically says "between", emphasising the distance and dispute between them; if everything would be one, there would be no reason to say "between". In this void the world is created, time and space. Therefore the Mishna continues "My days growing" - meaning, I increased time and space, in a sense creating a world, making time grow, because they were his days since he created a world [in the void]. "And found nothing good for the body but silence" - in the void, nothing is better than silence, since it is forbidden to enter unless one masters the aspect of silence, like Moses. This is the meaning of the Mishna: since he could reach this aspect of silence, he created time and space in the empty void between the scholars, for only through silence can one enter this place. "The exposition is not what is essential, but deeds, and whoever increases words increases sin" - because all the words and exposition of the scholars is not only for the sake of explaining things, but rather for deeds [<i>ma'aseh</i>, which can also mean 'creation'], for they create worlds through their words, and yet "whoever increases words increases sin" - an over-abundance of light creates the <i>klippot</i>.
This is the meaning of the Mishna (Avot 1:17): "I spent my days growing up between the scholars, and found nothing good for the body but silence. The exposition [of Torah] is not what is essential, but deeds. And whoever increases words brings sin." 
"Between the scholars" - this refers to the empty void formed through the dispute and distancing between scholars. Therefore it specifically says "between", emphasising the distance and dispute between them; if everything would be one, there would be no reason to say "between". In this void the world is created, time and space. 
Therefore the Mishna continues "My days growing" - meaning, I increased time and space, in a sense creating a world, 

making time grow, because they were his days since he created a world [in the void]. 

"And found nothing good for the body but silence" - in the void, nothing is better than silence, since it is forbidden to enter unless one masters the aspect of silence, like Moses. 
This is the meaning of the Mishna: since he could reach this aspect of silence, he created time and space in the empty void between the scholars, for only through silence can one enter this place. 
"The exposition is not what is essential, but deeds, and whoever increases words increases sin" - because all the words and exposition of the scholars is not only for the sake of explaining things, but rather for deeds [<i>ma'aseh</i>, which can also mean 'creation'], for they create worlds through their words, 
and yet "whoever increases words increases sin" - an over-abundance of light creates the <i>klippot</i>.

Section 5

5. Know this: by means of melody, a <i>Tzaddik</i> like Moses can raise the souls fallen into the heresy of the empty void. And know: every kind of wisdom in the world has melody and music which are unique to it, and each wisdom is derived from its particular music. This is the meaning of "skilful song" (Psalms 47:8) - each song is associated with particular skill and wisdom. 
Even heretical wisdom has its own melody and music, and this explains the Talmudic description of Elisha ben Abuya, "Greek songs flowed continuously out of his mouth, and as he rose from the house of study, several books of heresy would drop off of him." (Chagigah 15b) - this particular song was associated with this particular heresy. 
Each kind of wisdom, therefore, has melody and music appropriate to its type. The melody also changes according to the level of the wisdom, higher melodies for each level of wisdom, onwards and upwards until the absolute primal level of creation, which is the point of emanation, and there is no <i>makif</i> to such wisdom, only the light of the <i>ein sof</i> surrounding the empty void, which contains the world and all wisdoms. 
Even at such a level there is wisdom, but such wisdom touching on the light of the <i>ein sof</i> itself can only be know by the Holy One, whose wisdom cannot be fathomed at all, but can only be approached by faith: faith in the Holy One whose light surrounds all the worlds - and this faith also has its own melody and music. We see that even the false faiths of idol-worshippers have melodies, that they falsely sing in their houses of worship. In contradistinction, every type of holy faith also has its unique melody. 
And the highest faith, that of the light of the <i>ein sof</i> surrounding all worlds, has a melody of the highest kind: in fact, all other melodies draw from this specific melody, which is higher than all of them because it is attached to the highest possible faith, that of the light of the <i>ein sof</i>. 
And in the future, when He will "give all peoples a clear language, to call out together in the name of the LORD" (Zephaniah 3:9), and all will have faith in the Holy One, then the prophecy "Come look from the top of Amanah" (Song of Songs 4:8) will be fulfilled. "The top of Amanah" - this refers to the highest faith [<i>emunah</i>], on top of all other faiths. And it specifically says "look" [<i>tashuri</i>, related to <i>shir</i>, song], the melody and song belonging to the highest of faiths - 
this will be achieved by no other than the <i>Tzaddik</i> of the generation, one like Moses, who is on the level of such faith and capable of the aspect of silence, of whom was said "Silence, such has been thought out", one above speech. 
This is why it is written "Moses shall sing" (Exodus 15:1), and our sages pointed out that it says "will sing" rather than "sang" (Sanhedrin 91b), which is a reference in the Torah to the resurrection of the dead, since Moses is destined to sing in the future all possible songs, both of this world and of the future world, since all the songs of the future exist only with Moses, who is of the aspect of silence and merited the melody of the highest possible faith, from which all other melodies derive. 
Thus Rashi comments on the word "sing" [<i>yashir</i>, in which the letter yud is possibly superfluous], and says "yud comes to indicate thought", just like "such has been thought out", which was said of Moses and his silence. 
As such, by means of melody a <i>Tzaddik</i> like Moses can raise and extract all those souls that have fallen into the heresy of the empty void, since his melody is like "the top of Amanah", the highest faith of all. Truly, through such melodies and such faith all heresies are negated, and all melodies mix into the highest melody of all, which is the ultimate source of them all.

Section 6

6. This, then, is the meaning of <b>"Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart, etc.' " </b> (Exodus 10:1) 
These verses speak of the empty void. The word 'Pharaoh' implies negation (as it says, "break loose [<i>taphriu</i>] the people." (Exodus 5:4) ), but the same word also implies revelation, and this is similar to the empty void, which is empty and negated of everything, and within it the world is revealed. 
Within the void is a heaviness of heart, because the empty void cannot be comprehended; so too, all wisdom that derives from the empty void has a heavy heart, since its challenges cannot be resolved, and the presence of the Holy One cannot be found there, since it seems like He negated Himself from there, in order to allow for creation. 
<b>"Moses, go"</b> It had to be Moses who would go to Pharaoh, who is the empty void, because no one can enter such a place except for one like Moses, as we have shown, since the Holy One cannot be found there. This is why it says
<b>"for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants."</b> 'Servants' are like introductions of various wisdoms: each kind of wisdom also has an introduction which also derive from the empty void, and they also have a heaviness of heart since they cannot be resolved. 
<b>"That I might show these signs <i>otot</i> of Mine before him."</b> This means, that I might set down within him the letters [<i>otiot</i> of creation, within the empty void, from which He retracted in order to make room for creation.
<b> "That you may tell."</b> For within the world created within the empty void, you can speak and tell, because there are letters and words there. 
<b>"In the hearing of your son, and of your son’s son"</b>, since all of creation came from His compassion, as we have seen. Creation was performed by speech, and every word of creation is an act of compassionate retraction, meaning that everything created as it is was done out of compassion. The compassion of the Holy One is expressed as the desire that each thing be created as it is, since compassion is at the root of creation, and everything was created in order to reveal his compassion. 
This is seen in the verse "In the hearing of your son, and of your son’s son," which is like [Rashi's comment on a similar phrase in Genesis 21:23], "thus far extends one's compassion for his descendants." In everything created one can speak and discover His compassionate retraction, understanding that there is this much compassion in this thing, and this much compassion in that thing. 
<b>"What things I have done in Egypt"</b>. This refers to the <i>klippot</i> formed from the over-abundance of light and the broken vessels. Hence Rashi explains the words "I have done" as "I have mocked", I have made mockery and ridicule in the world, which refers to the <i>klippot</i>, which are grotesquely related to holiness, like someone contorting himself in front of his friend, or like a monkey trying to imitate a man. 
<b>"And My signs which I have done among them."</b> This refers to the letters that are there, [also] created by the over-abundance of light and the broken vessels. 
<b>"That you may know that I am the Lord." </b> This shows that even there, within this mockery of the <i>klippot</i> and within the first type of heresy, even there one can recognise the Holy One, because this is the type meant by the phrase "Know how to respond to the heretic." (Avot 2:14). Letters and sparks of holiness can be found there, and a response can be given, since they derive from the broken vessels. 
It then says, <b>"Tomorrow I shall bring locusts into your borders." </b> (Exodus 10:4) This refers to the end of days, like in the Talmudic phrase "Get your reward tomorrow," (Eruvin 22a) which refers to the end of days. This is also hinted at in the verse "So shall my righteousness be a witness to me tomorrow," (Genesis 30:33). At the end of days reward will be given, and one will be able to comprehend the paradox of the empty void, which is truly empty and yet filled with divinity. This in itself is the reward which awaits us at the end of days, when we will be able to comprehend everything on a level impossible today. 
Then it will be known that the empty void is like <b>locusts</b>, which are like "a snail whose garment is part of its body" (Bereishit Rabbah 21) - this mystery is brought in all the kabbalistic books, and is the essence of the concept of the empty void. The empty void and the divine retraction is also known as garment, and also "part of His body", this is the comprehension that one will finally receive at the end of days, that even though there truly is divinity in the void, it is a kind of garment. 
To the verse "So shall my righteousness be a witness to me tomorrow," we can add the verse "I wore justice" (Job 29:14), which speaks of the ultimate 'tomorrow', when the reward will be given and the mystery of the 'garments' of the divine retraction and the empty void will be understood. On that day, the "top of Amanah" will be revealed, which we have seen refers to the highest melody of the highest faith, by which all the contradictions of the empty void will be annulled. 
Therefore it says, "Tomorrow I shall bring locusts (<i>arbeh</i>)," which stands for "Truly there is spirit in mankind" (Job 32:8) [the first letters of which spell out <i>arbeh</i>], and this is music, which is a kind of spirit. In those days, therefore, the music and melody of the highest faith will be revealed, and it will negate all heresies, even those deriving from the empty void.

Section 1

"Do not judge your fellow until you are in their place." (Avot Chapter 2)
This also reflects what the Sages, of blessed memory said, "Surely judge every person favorably."(Avot Chapter 1). If a person is experiencing a machloket, they must reflect deeply to still find merits in their fellow. They should try to understand what the machloket is about in their fellow's view, in order to judge them favorably. 
There are two possible reasons for the machloket: a) their fellow is greater than them and argues with them in order to prevent them from acheiving their level. In order to resolve this machloket, the person must strive to acheive the same level as their fellow, in order that they both become equal and thereby eliminate the machloket.
b) the person is actually on a greater level than their fellow and the reason for the machloket is a result of their fellow's jealosy. In order to resolve this machloket, the person must judge their fellow favorably. By virtue of this they will actually elevate their fellow and bring them to stand on the same level. Once they stand in one place, on one level, there will not be any machloket because there is no machloket within one entity. 

This is what it means when it says not to judge another until we are in their place. 
This means that a person should strive to be with his fellow in one place, on one level, through one of the two methods, either bettering oneself or judging other favorably. Then, there will certainly not be any machloket, because there is no machloket within one entity.
Through a person elevating their fellow with merits, it is possible that their fellow will relent from their ways and change for the good, eliminating all future machloket. It is possible, too, however, that they will experience a downfall. This is because this process of finding merits in another can "be [like] scooping coals on his head." [Mishle 25:22].
This is why the concept is referred to as judging one's fellow favorably, for it literally represents the attributes of law and justice. For it is known that before one ascends to a certain level they are judged. Therefore, through a person judging their fellow favorably, which is really helping them ascend to a higher level, their fellow is judged. And the situation will materialize according to the ruling of the judgment.

Section 1

<b>"And all the people responded together, saying: All that God has spoken we will do! Moses brought their words before God. And God said to Moses: I am coming to you in the midst of a cloud, that the people shall hear Me speak to you... And Moses spoke the words of the people before God."</b> (Exodus 19:8-9) 
This is an odd and wonderful thing here, because what are these second words of the people, of which the verse ends "Moses spoke the words of the people before the Eternal"? It is not written anywhere in the Torah that they spoke or replied anything else after their first response, "All that the Eternal has spoken we will do." What then did Moses speak in their name the second time? 
However, know this: Israel complained about Moses instructing them to accept the Torah. They responded: "All that God has spoken we will do<b>?!</b>", meaning, "Shall we be forced to do everything that God tells us? There is no free choice in this! We would be compelled to act in a certain way!" 
This is the meaning of "we will <i>do</i>," since there is no choice not to do these things, once they are explicitly commanded by God. This is what it means in the verse, "Moses brought their words before God" - he relayed to God the complaints of Israel. 
Immediately, the Holy One replied: "I am coming to you" - to <i>you</i>, specifically - "that the people shall hear Me speak to you." Again, to you, I will only speak the Ten Commandments to you, saying "I am <i>your</i> God", "<i>You</i> shall have no other gods", and so on [in the second-person singular]. Not directly to the people of Israel, but they only listen to Me speaking to you, and through this they will retain their free will to do as they wish.

Section 1

Be it known to you that, via [self-]renewal of Torah, rivers are made: for when one begins to innovations in Torah), one then begins to spout forth a spring, in the behina (dimension/aspect) of: “A spring shall issue from the House of the Lord” (Joel 4:18); which (viz. the House) is the intellect, as it is written: “A house is built by wisdom” (Proverbs 24:3). 
And this very spring, at the start, is narrow and small, and afterwards widens and pervades more and more until rivers ultimately emerge from it—and all come to drink from these very rivers.
        As such, if one wishes to innovate novelties of Torah that are substantive, one must cry beforehand; for when said rivers are formed and all come to drink from them, then will the husks and the Sitra Ahara (the Other Side, or realm of evil) come as well, God forbid, to drink also from there. Therefore, one ought to cry beforehand, and consequently make rivers from crying, in the behina of: “He dams up the sources (or ‘the crying’) of the streams” (Job 28:11); that by means of crying one rectifies the rivers, from which all of the husks and the Sitra Ahara can drink that which is needed for their satisfaction. Accordingly, when one makes rivers out of Torah novelties that are innovated in the wake of [the rectification via crying], one can then draw down/extend them just to the appropriate places, so that “strangers” (that which is foreign/alien, viz. the husks and the Sitra Ahara) shall not drink from them. 
And for that reason the composition of the halakhot and the novelties are called “masekhet” (lit. tractate), as this is the behina of “v’Shikuvai b’v’Khi masakhti,” “and mixed (masakh) my drink with tears” (Psalms 102:10); that one must blend the drink with crying, because one must cry beforehand, as stated.
And this is the behina of: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, sat and wept” (Psalms 137:1)—this is the behina of the Babylonian Talmud, that was composed at the yeshivot (seminaries/houses of study), from which rivers are made, as stated. And hence: “and wept” — because one must cry beforehand, in the behina of: “and mixed (masakh) my drink with tears” (Psalms 102:10), as stated.

  A very important rule in Avodas Hashem is to only focus on what one has to do today. Whatever it may be a job, work, learning... One should always only focus what he has to do that day and not think ahead and look at everything he has at once. Focus on what you need to do at that moment alone. 
When someone wants to improve in his avodas hashem, of he doesn't take this advice and try to focus on everything he has to do not just today but the next day and the next week it will seem like a burden and too hard to follow. But when he only focuses on that day, that moment alone it will feel much easier. And he will be much better off.
And it's very important to not delay it and say, I will start tomorrow or later because all we have to do in this world is to focus on what we should be doing right now. 
That's why the pasuk said היום אם בקולו תשמעו to דוקא listen and start improving ourselves right now, one step at a time with whatever we have to do right in front of us right now.

Section 1

Know that there are some who say the Torah is from below to above, and from below it is very wide, because from below the matter is expanded and enlarged very much, whereas from above it is narrow, and becomes narrower as it rises, until its upper top is very narrow, and at its very top almost nothing, only very little remains, though there is certainly a holy spark there. 
But there are some who some the opposite, that the Torah is from above to below, and that above it is very wide, and as it descends it becomes narrower until at its bottom it is very narrow, but above it is very wide. 
So too is the case in awakening from the bottom, it must be narrow from below, in the aspect of (Psalms 66) "And my mouth shall speak when it is narrow for me," in the aspect of the shofar, which has its wide side above and its narrow side by the mouth. And this is the aspect of "And my mouth shall speak when it is narrow for me," meaning that the narrow side should be near me, near my mouth, in the aspect of a shofar, as mentioned above, 
and as we have seen with David in all his prayers, that started from narrowness and straits, that he experienced narrowness, for example because he experienced the woes of Absalom or of Naval, and the like, and afterwards he came through the prayer into the holy spirit.

Torah 281



Section 1

Even a simple person, if he sits himself with the book, and looks at the Torah's letters, can see new and wondrous things; through his looking very well at the Torah's letters, the letters will begin to enlighten and join together, through the aspect of letters that grow out and join together, as our Sages of blessed memory said (Yoma 73b), and he will then indeed see wonders and new combinations, and [we] can see in the book what the original author did not intend at all, 
and even a simple person can do this, but a great person can see this without effort, although even a completely simple person can attain [this] and see new things, as mentioned above, if he sits by himself and looks at the Torah's letters as mentioned, 
but he should not test this matter, because it may be that then he will not see anything at all, but even so even a simple person can attain this, as mentioned.

Torah 282



Section 1

Know, that it is necessary to judge every person as meritorious. Even if someone is entirely wicked, it is necessary to search and find in him some bit of good, that in that bit he is not wicked, and by means of this, that you find in him a bit of good, and judge him as meritorious, by means of this you raise him in truth to the side of merit, and you can return him in repentance. 
This is "a little bit and there is no wicked, you will contemplate on his place and he isn't there" (Psalms 37:10), that is, the verse warns to judge everyone as meritorious, and even though you see the he is completely wicked, even so, you must search and quest to find in him a bit of good where he isn't wicked. 
This is "a little bit and there is no wicked" - you have to search out in him a bit of good that is still there, where he is not wicked, because even though he is wicked, how is it possible that there isn't still a bit of good, because how is possible that he didn't do a mitzvah or a good thing his whole life? By means of this that you find in him a bit of good where he is not wicked, and you judge him as meritorious, by means of this you raise him in truth from the side of liability to the side of merit, until he returns in repentance by means of his. 
This is "a little bit and there is no wicked", by means of finding in the wicked a bit of good, where he isn't wicked 
"you will contemplate on his place and he isn't there", meaning when you contemplate and look at his place and level, he isn't there, in his original place, because by means of finding in him a bit of good, a good point, and judging him as meritorious, by means of this you truly take him from the side of liability to the side of merit. 
This is "you will contemplate on his place and he isn't there". Understand this well. [...]

Section 2

Just so, one must find [a modicum of good] in himself as well.  For it is well-known that one must take great care to be in a state of happiness at all times and to keep sadness very very distant (as we have explained several times).  
Even when one begins to scrutinize himself and sees that there is no goodness in him, and that he is full of sins, and the Plaintiff (lit. ba'al davar, one who has a claim; fig. the Evil One) desires to cause his downfall through sadness and depression (lit. black bile, melancholy), Heaven forfend, nevertheless it is forbidden for him to fall on this account. He must just seek to find in himself some modicum of good, for how is it possible that he did not perform in all his days some mitzvah or good deed? And even [if], when one begins to scrutinize that good deed, he sees that it is full of flaws and has no soundness, that is to say that one sees that even that mitzvah or holy deed that he merited to perform, it too is full of turnings and inappropriate intentions and many imperfections, nevertheless, how is it possible that there should not be in that mitzvah or holy deed some modicum of good? For, no matter how things are, there must have been some good point in the mitzvah or the good dead that he performed. 
For one must search out and seek to find in himself some modicum of good, in order to revive himself, and to attain joy, as mentioned above. By seeking to find in himself that there is still a modicum of good, he truly leaves the scale of guilt for the scale of merit, so that he is able to turn back in repentance. This is connected conceptually to the verse, "A little longer and there will be no wicked man; you will look at where he was— he will be gone," as mentioned above... 

Similarly, one must seek further, to find in himself another good deed. Even if that good deed likewise is mixed with much waste (פסולת), he will be able to extract from there likewise some good point. And thus one should seek to collect further good points (or "notes"/נקודות). 
In this way melodies are made, as explained in another place (Likutei Moharan 54), which is the concept of playing a musical instrument, which is related to collecting good breath (spirit, רוח) from the spirit of gloom and sadness, see there.... 
When one does not allow himself to fall, and revives himself by searching, seeking, and finding in himself some good points, and gathers and clarifies these good points from the bad and the waste that is in him, as stated above--in this way melodies are formed, and then he is able to pray, to sing, and to give thanks to God. 
For it is well-known that when one despairs on account of his physicality and evil deeds, seeing that he is really very, very far from holiness, then in most cases he is unable to pray at all, and is unable to open his mouth at all, due to the greatness of his sadness and melancholy and the heaviness that befalls him, since he sees the great force of his alienation (distancing, ריחוקו) from Hashem, may He be blessed...


This is connected conceptually with the verse, "I will sing songs to my God while I exist (=בעודי, through my עוד/still)" (Psalms 146:2)--precisely through my "still" (עוד), that is, by means of the concept of my עוד/still, that I find in myself--related to "A little longer (עוד, 'still') and there will be no wicked man; you will look at where he was— he will be gone" (Psalms 37:10), as mentioned above.  By means of this point/note (נקודה) [that is, the עוד/the modicum of goodness that persists], I will be able to sing and to give thanks to Hashem, as mentioned above.  Thus, "I will sing"--it is precisely that I will sing, that is, songs and melodies that are made by means of collecting the good notes, as mentioned above.

Section 1

The reason that people are distant from the blessed God and do not draw close to God is only because they lack a settled mind, and do not settle themselves. And the main [practice] is to try to settle oneself sufficiently, [and contemplate] what is the end purpose of all of the desires and matters of this world? This includes desires that relate to the body, as well as desires that are external to the body such as honor. Then one will surely return to God.

Section 2

But know, that when one is depressed it is impossible to navigate the mind as one desires, and it is therefore difficult for a person to settle their mind. It is only through joy that one can navigate their mind as they desire and can settle their mind. For joy is "the world of freedom," as in the verse, “for through joy you will go out” (Isaiah 55:12). Meaning that through joy we become free and emerge out of exile.
Therefore, when one connects joy to their mind, then their mind and awareness become free and one is no longer in an exilic reality. And then one is able to navigate their mind as they desire and settle the mind, because their mind is in a state of freedom and not in exile. For as a result of exile, the mind becomes unsettled, as the Sages, of blessed memory, taught (Megilla 12b) regarding the Ammonites and Moabites, that their minds were settled because they were never exiled, as it is stated (Jeremiah 48:11) : “Moab has been at ease from his youth on… and never gone into exile. Therefore, their minds remained in their place.

Section 3

And one can achieve joy by finding in himself a good point within oneself, despite everything, as has been explained about the verse “I will sing to God with what remains within me” (Psalms 146:2; Likutey Moharan I, 282). See there....

And this is the meaning of “a laughing mind” (Shabbat 77b), which is a great matter. Meaning that one connects joy to their mind and awareness, and then the mind becomes liberated, and one has a settled mind, as explained above. And also on high, this creates a great unification when one has a "laughing mind."

When one has a heart, 'place' has no significance at all. In fact, such a person is the place of the world. Because divinity rests in the heart, as it says (Psalms 73:26) "[G'd is] the rock of my heart." With regards to the Holy One it is written (Exodus 33:21) "There is a place with me" - that is, He is the place of the world, and the world is not his place. 
So too, one who has an Israelite heart should not say that such-and-such a place is unpleasant, because place is absolutely insignificant, rather, they are the place of the world, and the world is not their place.

Section 1

One who wishes to merit repentance, should accustom himself in saying Psalms, for the recitation of Psalms is effective (mesuggal) for repentance. ...  

By reciting Psalms, even one who has no independent awakening (hit'orerut) to repentance, will be aroused to repent, and will also merit by means of Psalms to reach the gate and the letter that are appropriate for him and to open the gate. Thus, by means of Psalms he will merit to repent. 
This is conceptually linked ("bechinat") to (II Samuel 23:1) "The utterance of the man set on high..." (concerning which) our Rabbis expounded (bMoed Katan 16b), that he [David] raised up the yoke of repentance, and [the same verse continues,] "...the favorite of the songs of Israel," for it is a result of the aspect of...the book of Psalms that he wrote, that one merits repentance, as said above. 
The Rabbis stated (bAvodah Zarah 4b) that David was not fit to act as he did in that matter (the affair of Batsheva, 2Samuel 11), except that in this way he could teach repentance to the individual (sinner). Consequently, the central teaching of repentance is through King David, and the root of the repentance of King David is the Book of Psalms, which he said in a state of very great awakening and with the Holy Spirit (Ruach haKodesh), so that everyone, according to his capacity, can find himself (his own spiritual situation) in the Book of Psalms, in order to merit repentance through the recitation of Psalms, as stated above....

Section 2



Section 3

The fact that  we see, during the Days of Repentance, that is in Elul and the Ten Days of Teshuvah, that all Israel occupy themselves with the recitation of Psalms, is because the recitation of Psalms is effective for repentance, as stated above.  Therefore, it is a very great matter to occupy oneself at all times in the recitation of Psalms, for Psalms [provides] a very, very, great awakening to HaShem, may He be blessed; happy is he who holds fast to it [the practice of reciting Psalms].

Section 4



Torah 74



Section 1

After Purim we read the portion called <i>Parah</i>, which is a preparation for Pessach. For we read Parah in order to be careful with regards to purification from the impurity of a corpse, in order to be pure for Pessach. 
And in the beginning, it has the aspect of <i>Pur</i> ("lot"), and Purim is also named after the <i>Pur</i>. Afterwards, it is read as <i>Parah</i>, since Purim is certainly on the way to Pessach. 
This is like the verse, (Song of Songs 5.13) "His lips are lilies, dripping with myrrh." Lips are like Pessach, which is [a homonym of] <i>Peh Sach</i>, a speaking mouth; Shoshana, meaning lilies, is Esther (according to the Zohar, and they have equivalent numerical values); "Dripping with myrrh" refers to Mordechai, who is [hinted at in the translation of the verse (Exodus 30:23)<i>Mor Dror</i>, and this ["<i>Dror</i>"] is a synonym of freedom, like the freedom of Pesach. 
Therefore, the letters of Purim are hinted at in [the issues of] Pesach, in the verse (Exodus 23.15), "Seven days shall you eat matzah, as I have commanded, in its time in the month of Aviv, in which you left Egypt, and you shall not encounter Me empty-handed." The initial letters [of the last five words] spell Purim. For Purim is on the way to Pesach, so that they could be careful with regards to chametz. (<b>Here Rabbi Nachman paused in the middle of the issue, and did not reveal more.</b>)
