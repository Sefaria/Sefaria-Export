Introduction

This book elucidates all the traits and conduct arranged according to the aleph-bet/alphabet. It is divided into two sections which are known to us by the names "Aleph-Bet of Old" and "Aleph-Bet of New." The first part is a wondrous collection, collected by our pure and holy master in his childhood, all that his huge intellect perceived by understanding one matter from another; and he gathered from all the holy books, everything that he found in them pertaining to morals, conduct, and upright behavior -- which he recorded to have by him for memory's sake. Whatever he found elucidated in the words of Our Sages of blessed memory, whether it be a virtue of a good trait, or the opposite -- derision of a bad trait -- everything in its entirety he would gather little by little and copy them by him in the order of the Aleph Bet by each and every trait, so that he should have them for remembrance, to see with his eyes the significance of each and every trait and its converse, in order to go in the ways of the good and guard the ways of the tzaddikim (based on Prov. 2:20). Moreover, his powerful intellect perceived many precious and wondrous matters which are not explicitly elucidated in the words of Our Sages OB”M; just by the sheer magnitude of his perception he understood one matter from another, and conceived precious novelty in the concepts of the traits from within the Scriptures and from within the words of Our Sages OB”M, which are not explicitly elucidated in their words, just hinted to -- for a genius of his caliber.
Everything he gathered and assembled together in the order of the Aleph Bet, and in the course of time there was found by him a complete compilation on all the traits, and he instructed to copy all of it, and from his mouth he read to me, and I transcribed in the book (according to Jer. 36:18), in order that this book should not desist from our mouths (Josh. 1:8) to speak (/think) it always, in order that we cease from bad traits. For everyone, when he sees arranged the utter derision of a bad trait and the great loss it causes, and the dreadful violation that is realized through it, he will have compassion on his soul, and he will gird his loins to stand up against it, and he will beseech from He to whom mercy is His, to escape with his soul from the abyss, to save him from those bad traits or bad desires or similar ones, and so in the converse regarding good traits.
Furthermore, (Prov. 16:20 -- Rashi) one who gives heart to contemplate his words (to forge his way), will find good -- true advice how to guard one's self from any particular vice, through making sure to be safe from the vice which is close (in the set up of the book, and it thus revealed that they are associated) to, for they are neighbors to each other, and each one guards her friend, as (this is) explained subsequently in the introduction that I heard from his holy mouth. The importance of this book, there is no need to explain, to anyone honest, who desires truth, and longs with cherishing to grasp the ways of propriety, certainly he will find in it a repose for his soul. Fortunate is he who takes hold of it, then it will be good for him in this (world) and in the coming (world), because this entire book is founded on verses of the Bible (Torah, Prophets, Scriptures) and on the words of Our Sages OB”M, all of them cogent to the understanding and straight, for those who have found cognizance (Proverbs 8:9).
The second part is also similar to the first part, in form and arrangement, there is no (marked) difference between them, for it is also an elucidation of the virtue of good traits and the derision of bad traits and the like.
Nevertheless, there is a difference between them, for the items elucidated in the first part, on each and every trait, they are matters which are elucidated in the holy books, explicitly or at least in allusion, so that someone who puts his heart to understand the matter, and who he who wants to study in depth to understand one matter from another, can understand and comprehend from where the Rav extracted this item, from which verse or from which teaching of Our Sages OB”M. For, all the matters elucidated in the Aleph Bet of Old are not remote and not distant (based on Deuteronomy 30:11) from the one studying them -- to come to its property, to understand and comprehend from where the items effuses. Albeit, without the Rav, who illuminated our eyes with these matters, it would not have occurred to the reader to extract these matters from within the holy books. However, after he already opened our eyes to these matters, it is possible for the enlightened (reader), whose heart is complete with the holy books; with the Tanakh (acronym for: Bible, Prophets, Scriptures -- 24 books in all), and with the Aggadot (lore) of Our Sages OB”M, and with the other commentaries, to understand and comprehend the relevant sources.
In contrast to this, the issues elucidated in the second part are lofty and awesome conceptions perceived by the author OB”M, in the days of his greatness. All of these matters transcend human comprehension and are hidden from all eyes. For each and every item there is a very wondrous and awesome taam (reason, taste, cantillation, secret) and it is supported by some verse or teaching of Our Sages OB”M through a very wondrous and fabulous allusion, in his wondrous style, as the reader will see for himself. For there are many items elucidated here without (presentation of) any reason or proof, and within the major compilation of discourses (Likutay Moharan -- A Collection of the Teachings of Rabbi Nachman) it is expatiated there, a complete matter, and a wondrous and awesome exposition on this item at great length, and this you will find in many places. So too one should learn the characteristics of the vague from what is explained, that also in the places that he did not explain the item explicitly, also there his masterful hand attained a complete conception of it (the item presented without elaboration), just, for some ulterior reason he did not want to provide the explanation of the item.
For all these matters, all of them are supernal and from a holy place they traverse, from a very extremely awesome lofty source, and they do not contain a single matter which does not command an awesome and wondrous exposition on what its foundations were cast, the reason for the matter, its characteristics, and a very hidden, deep, and wondrous support from within the Written Torah or Oral Torah. It is not for us to elongate on the paramount praise of these matters, because all who add, detract. For it is not hidden from our eyes the lowliness of our worth -- and the greatness of our master the holy Rav, supernal candelabra, OB”M, and his utter hiddenness and concealment from the eyes of the world (people), this being the case, we must put restraint to our mouth, to be silent and not to mention, not to relate the magnitude of his holy praise, not a matter nor half a matter, and the enlightened will be silent now, Almighty G-d Hashem -- He knows and Israel will know (based on Joshua 22:22). Fortunate is he who waits and reaches the days that have aspiration, at the time when the glory of Israel will rise, truth from the earth will rise (Psalms 85:12), a language of truth will be established forever (Proverbs 12:19), it does not say 'was established' but 'will be established' (Tikunay Zohar 63, pg. 95a). The medication for the matter -- silence, everyone, according to the fathoms of his heart, will understand and comprehend the extent, to where these matters reach.
Still, we come with these words, to arouse the hearts of the readers, to make known to them the nature of the book and its affairs. It is incumbent upon us to make known and reveal to the ears of our peers (the hasidim of Breslov), that our honorable master, the hidden light, of holy and blessed memory, warned strongly to engage in this book, and that it should not cease from our mouths, for it is our life. He himself wrote it in a very small volume and said that his intent was to enable each and every one to carry it with him always, because the traits are the foundation of the entire Torah -- and with this a youth (or someone of that standing) will make his ways meritorious to heed everything that his written in this book, then he will bring success to his ways, and then he will be enlightened. For this is the main task of a person, all the days of his life, to flee from vice and bad desires, and to cling to virtue and upright conduct, that are elucidated in this book.
Fortunate is the person who listens to these words, to fulfill all that is written herein. He will never slip (based on Psalms 112:6) and his righteousness will answer for him in the time to come (based on Beraishis 30:33), when he comes to receive his reward. In the measure that a person meets out -- so (In that same measure) is he met with. Fortunate is one who chooses life -- Hashem will repay his endeavors, if it is to scoffers He will scoff (Proverbs 3:34), he will not gain wealth and his wealth will not endure (Job 15:29), woe to his soul -- for the retribution of his handiwork will be done to him (Isaiah 3:11), it will not be cast to the ground (but on their heads -Job 15:29), one who is good before G-d will escape from it (Ecclesiastes 7:26). How great is the goodness hidden away for him (based on Psalms 31:20), in his joy no stranger will take part (Proverbs 14:10), a laboring soul benefits from its labor (Proverbs 16:26, see also Tractate Sanhedrin 99b -- he works here and his Torah works for him elsewhere). Let us pour out our souls to Hashem to put our portion with Him, to stand at the threshold of His shade, they will have no regrets -- those who put their trust in Him (Psalms end of Chapter 34), no eye has seen (their reward) except for You G-d, what He will do for those who put their hope in Him (Isaiah 64:3).
The words of the transcriber, whom is reduced to sighing and is crushed by the departure of the splendor of our heads, the majesty of our strength, the cherishing of our eyes, what can we say? May G-d (lit. the place -- for G-d is the place of the world and not vice versa) comfort us very soon, the little one, Nussun, son of my master my father our teacher Rav Naftoli Hertz may his candle shine, from the greater Nemerov, son-in-law of the Rav, the genius, the famous, the tzadik, our teacher Rav Dovid Tzvi OB”M Chief of the Court of the Congregation of Muehluv.

Second Introduction



Truth

Part I

A person who wants to attach himself to the Holy One—so that his thoughts travel from one chamber to the next, seeing these chambers with his mind’s eye—should avoid speaking falsely, even accidentally.
One is permitted to distort the truth in order to preserve peace.
Those who tell lies are not worthy of receiving the Divine Presence.
A Tzaddik is permitted to act deceitfully with one who deceives others.
All those who add, detract.
Telling lies brings one to thoughts of idolatry.
By being truthful, a person will not die before his time.
The breath from a liar’s mouth gives rise to the evil inclination. When Mashiach comes, falsehood will cease to exist and so there will be no evil inclination in the world.
A person of truth can recognize in another if he is speaking falsely or not.
A sign that something is false is that it is opposed by the majority. The liar is one of the three types of people whom God despises.
Reason cannot tolerate a rich person’s deceit. Even he finds himself despicable.
Giving charity rectifies one’s speech.
Truth protects the world from all manner of harm.
Flattery leads to lying.
A person who gives charity merits attaining the truth.
The liar despises humility.
One can tell from a person’s servants whether he is fond of falsehood. This is because the one is dependent upon the other. There are times when a person’s servants fall into sin because he is a liar, and other times when he stumbles into falsehood because his servants behave improperly.
One who lacks truth lacks kindness. Such a person cannot deal {kindly} with people.
Falsehood delays redemption, for it brings a person’s sins out into the open, thus preventing him from being saved.
Truth redeems from all suffering.
A person should rather die, than live and be considered a liar by others.
Where there is truth, there is peace.
One who is far from the truth is far from charity.
Truth protects the sign of the <i>brit.</i>
By telling the truth, a person earns everlasting esteem.
When a husband and wife accustom themselves to lying, their children will be rebellious and sexually immoral.
A person will speak falsely when he is afraid of other people.
Falsehood causes a person to forget God.
A person who does not trust in God speaks falsely, and by telling lies becomes incapable of trusting the truth.
The further a person is from truth, the more he considers one who turns away from evil to be a fool.
Seeing that there is no truth in the world, a person who wants to turn away from evil must play the fool.
When a person does not speak falsely, God saves him in a time of misfortune. He will also be blessed with children.
Idle talk brings harm to one’s children.
A person steeped in idleness becomes forgetful.
Falsehood leads to immorality and strengthens the hand of evildoers so that they do not return to God in repentance.
A person who lies has no cure even with numerous medicines.
A person who tells lies is cut down. He also becomes a fool.
Fear of God brings a person to truth.
A person who guards himself from falsehood is always victorious.
It is permissible to alter the truth in order to save oneself from harm.
A person who is fond of falsehood will disgrace the Tzaddik, and will himself be shamed.
One who speaks falsely perishes.
Truth saves a person from slander. By telling the truth his prayers are accepted, and when judged on high, he will be judged according to his merits.
A person can tell from his dreams whether his heart is true with his God.
A person who keeps his word can accomplish great things.
One who has no haughtiness is saved from lies.
Whoever guards against frivolity is clearly a person of truth.
When someone who was a liar in a previous lifetime is reincarnated, he comes back left-handed.
When a person is careful and always speaks truthfully, it is like he created heaven and earth, the seas and all that they contain.
Falsehood applies only to the spoken word, not the written one.
The Torah, the Prophets and the Sages made use of hyperbole [in their teachings].

Part II

People don’t listen to one who speaks falsely. Lying also causes a person to be widowed from a number of wives, God forbid.
Truth reveals God’s Oneness in the world.
When you see a liar, you should know that his spiritual leader is also false.
Falsehood leads a person to immorality and murder. It also causes the upright to err in sexual and homicidal matters, and teaches permissiveness in the Torah.
When a person does not distort his words, he is able to humble the haughty and elevate the meek.
A person who does not speak one way with his lips and another in his heart has no fear of drowning.
Truth brings to satisfaction.
The disorders of diarrhea and constipation come from lying.
Truth will bring the Final Redemption.

Hospitality

Part I

An inhospitable person strengthens the hand of evildoers so that they do not return to God in repentance.
[The inhabitants of] a city in which hospitality is not practiced will turn to immoral behavior, and this in turn will bring murder into their midst.
Hospitality brings a woman to be blessed with children.
Receiving guests is like receiving Shabbat.
A person who welcomes a Torah scholar into his home is considered as having offered the daily-sacrifice.
Hospitality is even greater than arriving early at the house of Torah study and receiving the Divine Presence.
Jews who have no rabbis in their midst are like Samaritans.

Part II

A person’s hospitality causes people to revere him.
Hospitality is a <i>segulah</i> for restoring a woman’s menses.
God’s holiness validates and affirms the prominence of the generation’s leaders. This in turn brings everyone to value the <i>mitzvah</i> of hospitality, and the Torah scholars to merit having the law follow their opinion.

Love

Part I

When there is no love between people, they bear tales. Their tale-bearing brings them to mock one another, and their mockery then leads them to telling lies.
Hatred leads to turmoil and fires.
One’s love for God protects his soul from misfortune.
Achieving love for God requires that you first repent for your sins.
Everyone loves a person who is completely given over to praying for the Jewish people.
Love brings to encouragement.
Encouraging someone in his service of God will bring him to love you.
You can merit loving God by reciting the <i>Hallel</i> prayer in a loud voice.
When engaged in ligation with a mute who refuses to reach a compromise, guarding against unwarranted hatred will bring him to settle with you.
A person who guards against swearing falsely will certainly not transgress the precept of “not taking revenge nor bearing a grudge” (Leviticus 19:18).
Garlic increases love.
The merit earned by a person who serves God out of love stands as a lasting protection for two thousand generations.
God is present wherever pacts and agreements are made.

Part II

When the earth’s plant life reaches full size, there is love in the world.
The measure of a woman’s love for her husband is [in inverse proportion to the number of] flies and gnats in their house. Also, from their love we can tell whether the evil inclination’s power [over them] has been weakened.
The wise men of the generation who love each other and visit each other from time to time have the power to judge the entire world. Their judgment is lasting and no one will be able to change or nullify it, for God Himself is the head magistrate of their court.
Unwarranted hatred causes a person to unintentionally eat unkosher food.
A person’s lust for food causes him to favor one child over the others.

Faith

Part I

One’s belief in God must come through faith and not because of miracles.
You can achieve faith by being humble.
When you see something out of the ordinary, don’t say that it is coincidence; rather, believe that it is Divine providence.
There are things that bring great harm to the world and it is difficult to understand why they were created. You should know that they most certainly have some aspect of good.
Finding the words of a heretic pleasing will bring a person to thoughts of idolatry, even if those words are not heretical in and of themselves.
A person’s faith endears him to God much like a wife is dear to her husband.
Without first preparing his heart, a person cannot achieve faith.
One who loses something has clearly fallen from his faith.
One who has lost his faith should visit Jewish graves and recount the kindness that God has performed for him.
Faith is dependent upon a person’s mouth. [Speaking about faith not only increases faith—it is faith! <i>(Likutey Moharan</i> II, 44)].
Torah study destroys all heresy.
Belief in God brings blessing.
Overeating leads to a fall from faith.
Gazing at the sky when it is clear and bright will bring you to faith in the Sages.
Should you find yourself questioning God, keep silent. By virtue of this silence, your very thoughts will provide you with an answer to your questions.
Remaining silent when you are insulted will earn you an answer to your questions and you will merit a spirit of understanding.
You should know that when a person’s opponents are wise and very wealthy, it is because he has repeatedly fallen from faith.
Faith is considered like charity.
Belief in God makes one wise.
It is first necessary to have faith in God, and only then will you be worthy of understanding Him with your intellect.
The unification of the Holy One comes about through the souls of the Jewish people.
A person’s sins bring him to entertain heresy.
When a person falls from his belief in God, he will cry.
Faith comes by remaining silent [in the face of criticism].
A person’s jealousy causes him to fall from his belief in God.
A person with no faith clearly belittles the words of the Torah.
A person who is always cleaning his hands is purifying his heart.
When a person falls from faith, he should know that he is being judged on high.
One who has fallen from his belief in God will experience a seminal emission, and be plagued with promiscuous thoughts and thoughts of idolatry.
Faith comes through giving charity.
By means of faith one can come to understand God.
Through faith one can come to trust in God.
Because of faith, God will forgive all your sins.
There are times when God sends a person suffering and punishment, but He does not weaken him. This is only in order to foster faith.
Swearing falsely causes a person to fall from faith.
A person without faith does not accept rebuke.
A person who does not believe in the words of the Tzaddik will in the end have no benefit from them, even though he will see [them coming true].
A person without faith certainly despises God’s statutes.
Mashiach will come suddenly and, because of their joy, the Jews will fear.
When Mashiach comes, all the ministers on high and also those below in this world will be weakened. But now, whenever there is an ascent by any minister, the Jews are weakened.
In the World to Come, the “younger” one is the higher the level to which he will ascend.
Jerusalem was destroyed only because the Jews: desecrated Shabbat; neglected reciting both the morning and evening <i>Shema</i>; were lax in educating their young schoolchildren; felt no shame in each other’s presence; equated the lowly with the great; did not rebuke one another, but ridiculed Torah scholars; and there were no longer any men of faith in the city.
Jerusalem will be redeemed only through charity.
War is the beginning of redemption.
A person who raises pigs delays the redemption.
Jerusalem will not be rebuilt until there is peace among Jews.
That the Jews wander in exile from nation to nation is a sign that Mashiach will come.
When the nations insult us a great deal, it is a sign that Mashiach’s arrival is imminent.
The House of God will not be built until haughtiness ceases to exist.
The spirit of oneness that will exist among Jews will bring Mashiach.
Mashiach will come in a year of blessing.
Mashiach won’t come until all the souls have been emptied from the body [of Primordial Man].
When a person marries his daughter to a Torah scholar, or benefits a scholar with his possessions, or engages in business on the scholar’s behalf, he merits being resurrected from the dead.
The breath from a liar’s mouth gives rise to the evil inclination. When Mashiach comes, falsehood will cease to exist and so there will be no evil inclination in the world.
A person of truth can recognize in another if he is speaking falsely or not.
A majority of people will not agree to something false.
The Holy One despises a person who speaks one way with his lips and another in his heart.
Reason cannot tolerate a rich person’s deceit. Even he finds himself despicable.
Giving charity rectifies one’s speech.
Truth protects the world from all manner of harm.
Flattery leads to lying.
A person who gives charity is rewarded with attaining the truth.
A person who lies will certainly despise humble people.
One can tell from a person’s servants whether he is fond of falsehood.
When there is no truth, there is no kindness.
If you are in any way false, then when God desires to save you, this falsehood brings your sins out into the open so that He should not save you.
For telling the truth, God will redeem you from all suffering.
A person should rather die, than live and be considered a liar by others.

Part II

There are times when a person comes to some place where he experiences anguish. He should know that his ancestors were in that place and came to some form of heresy, or that his descendants will one day be there and come to some heresy. This is the reason he is now suffering.
Flattery leads one to heresy.
The Holy One performs miracles only for a person who believes in both worlds.
Our faith in God nullifies the evil decrees that the nations issue against us.
Know! each and every herb has its own unique power to heal a specific illness. But this is only for a person who did not guard his faith and sexual purity, and did not keep from transgressing “Do not despise any man” (Avot 4:3). However, when one has complete faith and also maintains sexual purity and fulfills “Do not despise any man,” his cure is not dependent upon particular types of herbs. Rather, he is healed by all food and drink, as in “And He blessed your bread” (Exodus 23:25). He does not have to rely upon receiving particular herbs to be cured.
The future salvation will come about only because of faith, the measure of which is in accordance with the leaders of the generation.
Going from one teacher to another requires that a person strengthen his faith in the unity of God. Learning from many teachers detracts from belief in His Oneness. Nevertheless, the teacher who has faith in His Oneness is able to enlighten each and every student according to his ability, as each student hears only that which is necessary for him and no more.
Consolation comes through faith in God.
Flies multiply in the world because there is a lack of faith.
A person who is careful not to transgress the prohibition against coveting will be saved from anger and haughtiness, and from the lack of faith that results from those two evil traits.
Because the Jews do not make His Godliness known to the peoples of the world, they are lured by the nations into following foreign ideologies.
Corruption of faith gives rise to stern judgment. Thoughts of idolatry awaken doubly strict judgments. That is, even the judgments that have already been issued are reviewed to ensure that they were properly issued, without leniency.
A person suffers childlessness, God forbid, when he causes another to fall from faith.
When a woman is heedful of the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>challah,</i> her sons will be masters of faith.
Faith settles the mind.
Torah brings to faith, and faith brings to sanctifying the Name of God.
A person who finds that he cannot sleep should think about his belief in the resurrection of the dead.
Those with only a small measure of faith have difficulty gaining new insights into the Torah.

Eating

Part I

Leave over a bit of your meal so that your sustenance will receive God’s blessing.
A person’s table purifies him from all his sins.
A person’s table earns him the World to Come as well as a livelihood [in this world]. He is inscribed for good in the uppermost worlds and is also rewarded with increased power and strength when he needs it.
The sins of delaying justice, distorting and corrupting judgment, and neglecting Torah study bring drought. People will eat, but will not be satiated; they will partake of their bread in measure.
Eating just a little causes one’s heart to want more food; more so than when one has lost hope of eating and has eaten nothing at all.
Why were the Jews deserving of destruction? Because they delighted in the feast of that wicked one, [Achashveirosh].
The Altar abolishes evil decrees, atones for sin, nourishes and endears. One’s table is comparable to the Altar.
When a person eats without first washing his hands [as Torah law prescribes], it is as if he visited a prostitute. Whoever ridicules this religious requirement is uprooted from the world.
One should not drink water in public.

Part II

A person whose being reflects the Godly image is elevated through eating living things. The inverse is also true, [as one who does not reflect the Godly image is brought down by eating living things].
Eating fish arouses the desire for marital relations.
God is made known in the world through Grace after Meals.
Reciting Grace after Meals brings the country’s government relief from disputes and wars.
When a person studies Torah with pure thoughts, so that he eats with such holiness that he is nourished by the sustenance of the angels, his enemies are sentenced to strangulation. This is alluded to [by the verses], “And it was on the third day, in the morning...” (Exodus 19:16); “then in the morning there was a layer of dew” (ibid. 16:13); “And it was at the morning watch...” (ibid. 14:24). <small>(I heard this explanation from the Rebbe’s holy mouth: ‘“And it was on the third day, in the morning’ was said during the Giving of the Torah and refers to a person who studies Torah with pure thoughts. ‘Then in the morning there was a layer of dew’ was said about the manna, the food from which the angels draw sustenance, as our Sages taught (see <i>Yoma</i> 75b). ‘And it was at the morning watch’ was said at the splitting of the Red Sea, when the Egyptians were drowned, which is an aspect of strangulation, as our Sages taught (see <i>Ketuvot </i>30b).” Rebbe Nachman learned from one “morning” and applied it to the other, thereby deriving the above {insight} from the Torah.)</small>
Whoever cannot taste the food he eats should know that God has removed Himself from him.
When Tzaddikim eat, it is [an act of holiness] even greater than bringing sacrifices, and on a higher level than even their marital relations.
Fish grow fatty in the merit of the sacrifices.
A person bitten by a dog clearly has had Heaven’s mercy removed from him. It is also a sign that he has eaten forbidden food.
Whoever is careful not to eat forbidden foods is saved from wild beasts.
One whose enemies have gained prominence succumbs to a lust for food.
A person’s lust for food causes him to favor one child over the others.
<i>“L’chu lachmu v’lachmi u’shetu b’yayin masakhti</i> (Come eat of my bread and drink of the wine that I have mixed)” (Proverbs 9:5). The first letters of <i>L’chu Lachmu V’Lachmi U’shetu</i> spell <i>LULaV</i> (לולב). <i>B’yayin</i> (ביין), with its four letters, has a numerical value (76) equivalent to that of the first letters of <i>etrog</i> (אתרוג), <i>hadas</i> (הדס) and <i>aravah</i> (ערבה); and <i>maSaKhTi </i>is similar to SuKkoT. By fulfilling the <i>mitzvot</i> of the Four Species and <i>sukkah,</i> a person is rewarded with food, drink, clothing and a revived spirit. Through the <i>mitzvah</i> of <i>sukkah </i>he merits clothing, as in “When I made a cloud its garment” (Job 38:9). By virtue of the willow branch he merits sufficient drink; through the myrtle branch he brings vitality to the soul; and through the palm tree and the citron tree, both of which bear edible fruit, he merits having enough to eat.
One’s food and drink come from observing the Torah’s statutes and laws.
Drinking rouses a person to sing and play musical instruments, whereas eating does not. This is because [in the wilderness] the Jewish people sang the praise of God over the well, but not over the manna.

A Widower

Part I

A person whose wife died should recite daily the chapter of the guilt-offering (Leviticus 7:1-7) until he remarries.

Part II

People do not listen to someone who speaks falsely. Lying also causes a person to be widowed from a number of wives, God forbid.
When a man’s wife dies, it is like losing one of his bones. But this is not so for the Tzaddik when his wife dies, as hinted by the word <i>ALMan</i> (widower), whose letters stand for <i>“Achat Mehaynah Lo Nishbarah</i> (not one of them [the bones] was broken)” (Psalms 34:21).

The Land of Israel

Part II

By settling in the Land of Israel, a person gains insight into God’s providence over the world.
A person draws from the holiness of the Land of Israel in accordance with the original insights that he finds in the Torah.
One’s yearning to come to the Holy Land brings him great blessing in his livelihood.
Whoever provides support for many people draws blessing from the Land of Israel to the Diaspora.
One’s yearning for the Holy Land arouses yearning in the souls of his father and mother, which then come to the Land of Israel. And God comes with them, so that together they look forward to and yearn for his arrival.
The charity a person gives to the poor people of the Land of Israel causes him to prosper monetarily.
Anyone who knows of the Holy Land, who has really tasted the Land of Israel, can recognize in another whether he has been with the {true} Tzaddik for Rosh HaShanah. For when a person merits being with the true Tzaddik for Rosh HaShanah, wherever he focuses his attention he transforms the air there into an aspect of the air of the Land of Israel. Therefore, one who knows the taste of the Holy Land, each according to his own level, will of necessity feel the Land of Israel when he comes together with this person who has been with the true Tzaddik for Rosh HaShanah, through whom the air becomes an aspect of the Holy Land.

Lost Objects

The same faculty that enables one to return a lost object to its owner enables him to win converts for God.

Children

Part I

When one cries in mourning for the passing of an honest person, he merits raising his children.
Care must be taken that a baby boy does not go bareheaded.
A person need not worry about having enough to support his children. As they grow, so does his income.

Part II

Know! each world and every creation has its own particular form and unique construction. For example, the build of the lion differs from that of the sheep in its strength and in its bone structure {also in its voice}. This is also true within the lion species {itself}; there being differences between one lion and the next. These distinctions between creations are alluded to in the forms of the letters and their combinations. One who merits understanding the Torah is able to understand these differences between all the creations. He will also know what they have in common—namely, their origin and their end, in which they are identical, without distinction.
Know! a person has mastery over the world in direct proportion to his knowledge of Torah and Nature. This is why Daniel was able to subdue the lions, since he was very wise and “no secret escaped him” (Daniel 4:6). He knows the lion’s nature, and Nature itself follows and is under the dictates of Torah knowledge. <small>(Reb Nachman Tulchiner said: “I heard from Reb Noson that this teaching relates to the one preceding it, to what is written there, ‘One who merits understanding the Torah...’ Thus, his understanding of the combinations of the letters in the Torah is in direct proportion to his knowledge of the natural behavior of things in the world. Understand this! For a wonderful and very pleasing explanation of this, see <i>Likutey Halakhot, Yoreh Deah, Milah</i> 5:23ff. The truth is that one who looks with a positive and true eye and with an upright heart will find no difficulty in comprehending this. One the contrary, he will see the wonders of God’s greatness and that of the true Tzaddikim. These opponents, who arrogantly speak against the Tzaddik and from the very outset view the Tzaddik’s holy writings with an eye to finding fault, will never find a satisfying explanation. Even after all these explanations and truths, they continue to look for pretexts and devise false charges with which to haughtily speak against the Tzaddik and his disciples, may their merit protect us. Nevertheless, I could not hold myself back from presenting a bit of what I heard regarding this. For truth stands! ‘But a lying tongue is for a moment’ (Proverbs 12:19), ‘and the truth of God is forever’ (Psalms 117:2). He will save us from the double-edged sword; and, as His mercy has supported until now, so will it support us evermore. Amen! Study <i>Likutey Moharan</i> 1,17 and 19, and you will understand a little.”)</small>
When a person attains the insight that God is One and that there is no other, this enables him to force corporeality upon the angels on high, so that they go and do his bidding.
When a person uses his faith to banish thoughts of idolatry, those thoughts are transformed into the aspect of “the dew of blessing.” This also results in his mind remaining firm and never becoming confused. Even when it is taxed by deep concentration on a complex subject, the Holy One provides him with thoughts that relieve his mind.
The merit of those who support the poor saves the masses from plague. Also in their merit, expanded consciousness precedes [rather than follows] constricted consciousness.
Even within foolishness and folly there is wisdom.
Hearing the voice of a person who is wise in the ways of holiness is especially beneficial for acquiring the fear of God.
Confusion of the mind corrupts one’s fear of God. It also diminishes his authority.
The sages of a generation are its wings. The generation’s closeness to and understanding of God, or conversely its distance from Him, is in direct proportion to the wisdom of these sages. But in the future, people will not require wisdom in order to perceive His Godliness, for then, “And your Teacher will not withdraw Himself anymore” (Isaiah 30:20) will be fulfilled in us.
One who wants to use his intellect to delve into and investigate some subject should bind his intellect to the Holy Temple. This is alluded to by the verses, “I will fetch my knowledge from afar” (Job 36:3), and “He saw the place, [the Temple Mount,] from afar” (Genesis 22:4).
Faith settles the mind.
When people convert, <i>daat</i> is increased in the world.
Even the prophets know only that which the Holy One reveals to them.
A physically strong person has only mediocre intelligence.
Large steps hinder concentration.
A person who steals loses his wisdom.
When a person’s thoughts are on the physical needs of a fellow Jew, and that person’s thoughts are on his physical needs, this forms the crossbeams of the world.

A Judge

The decision of a truthful judge is never annulled. His verdict is carried out, even against the will of the litigants.

Part I

The solution then is for ‘the children of man [to] <i>B’tzail K’nafekha Yechesayun</i> (take shelter under the shadow of your wings).’ The first letters spell <i>Be’KhY</i> (crying), since crying helps for this.”)</small>

This corresponds to the warning given to the <i>Kohanim—</i> who personify the aspect of lovingkindness—not to take large steps [while performing the Temple service].

A courthouse of Torah law inspires the fear of God.
When a person’s kosher food becomes mixed with forbidden food, if the kosher food is insufficient for nullifying the prohibition, the entire mixture is rendered unkosher. This happens in order to show him that he has blemished some supernal unification, because a supernal unification is spiritually akin to nullifying the forbidden through the permitted. This is <i>“motzeeASiRIMbaKOShaRote</i>  <small>(He releases prisoners at the most opportune times)” (Psalms 68:7), [which can also be read as: “He removes the forbidden”—<i>ASuRIM—</i>through the permissible—<i>KOSheR],</i></small>
When there is peace in the country, the Jewish people are blessed with children who will be instructors of Torah law.
A rabbi who is stringent when advising others but lenient with himself, and who claims to be versed in a matter when he is not, will not merit seeing the splendor of the King.

A person who deeply ponders the Works of the Chariot will pass away before his time.

Original Torah; Sights

The radiance that a person receives from the holiness of the Land of Israel is commensurate with the insights he originates in the Torah.
Supportive proofs from the Torah for Rabbinical enactments bring abundant prosperity to the world. This is because there are a number of things for which we find no explicit verse in the Torah on which to base them, and the Sages labored to find some supportive reference [as proof for their enactment].
Original Torah insights increase the revelation of Divine providence in the world.
When a Jew is taken captive, his aspect of the wellsprings of wisdom becomes sealed from the sages of the generation. The reverse happens when a person is freed from captivity.

Those who would reveal original Torah insights must study the Codifiers beforehand and then again afterwards. This study of Torah law will protect their insights from foreign influences. This same procedure should also be followed when a person wants to perform some act of charity.
Originating Torah insights arouses the giving of charity, and vice versa.
Insights are gained into the mysteries of Creation in proportion to the insights into the Torah that are originated.
Not all the Torah insights that a person originates may be written down. There are certain insights that are meant to be given over only verbally. One who knows which insights are to be written down and which are not also has the ability to detect the lone Jew from among a thousand gentiles.
A person should refrain from teaching Torah at a time or in a place where it will not be appreciated. And even at a time or in a place that his words will draw the proper attention, he must be careful to say only as much as is appropriate—unlike “The fool [who] speaks everything” (Proverbs 29:11). When one says everything on his mind, his body becomes swollen with an excess of liquid in the blood. [The need for restraint can be derived from the verse,] “He makes a weight for the wind and weighs the waters by measure” (Job 28:25).
Through his Torah insights a person merits having a beautiful <i>talit.</i>
There are times when the Tzaddik strives to achieve something, or struggles to comprehend a certain aspect of the Torah, only to later find that it has come to someone less righteous than himself, without that person having to work to achieve it. This is only because the door had already been opened [through the Tzaddik’s efforts].

Marriage

Learn only from a person who is God-fearing.
Through Torah study you will be rewarded with peace.
When the Torah you teach is consistent with your level, and not above it, the Holy One carries out your wishes.
Heresy destroys a person’s desire for learning.
By giving charity for the sake of Heaven, you will merit studying Torah for the sake of Heaven.

When you pay a price for a Torah insight, you won’t forget it.
When a person chases after his heart’s desires, each and every Torah verse can be interpreted as alluding to his shame.
Whoever separates himself from the path of Torah attaches himself to Satan.
When two Torah scholars show mutual respect and humbly dispute Halakhah for its own sake, the Holy One sees to it that they are successful and gain prestige. They merit Torah, which was given with the “right hand,” and are rewarded with those things that emanate from the Torah’s “right side.”
A Torah scholar is as vindictive as a snake. Attach yourself to him so that eventually you will derive benefit from his learning.
It is forbidden to learn from someone who draws people to idolatry. One who learns from him deserves death.
Torah without <i>mitzvot</i> is like a myrtle branch, which has a good smell but no taste.
With whom will you find the various branches of Torah? With a person who arrives early to the study hall and stays late in order to study them, and who on their account resembles a raven, blackening his face [with deprivation] and bringing himself to be unpitying with his children.
A person cannot successfully learn from everyone. This is the reason people travel great distances in order to study.

Part II

There are afflictions that one suffers whose appointed time is determined by the astronomical factors that require those afflictions. However, the will and yearning aroused in the students at the time set for them to go and learn Torah from their teacher nullifies these afflictions before their appointed time.
Studying Torah, giving tithes, and observing Shabbat provide material benefits as well.
Studying the <i>Shulchan Arukh</i> brings one to fear God.
When a person studies Torah with pure thoughts, so that he eats with such holiness that he is nourished by the sustenance of the angels, his enemies are sentenced to strangulation. This is alluded to [by the verses], “And it was on the third day, in the morning...” (Exodus 19:16); “then in the morning there was a layer of dew” (Exodus 16:13); “And it was at the morning watch...” (Exodus 14:24; see above, <i>Eating </i>B:5).
The outstanding and sharp minds of the generation cause the fear of Heaven to shine. This fear sparks the merit of ancestors, which in turn awakens the world to repentance.
Studying Halakhic codifiers nullifies thoughts of idolatry.
Going from one teacher to the next requires that a person strengthen his faith in the unity of God. Learning from many teachers detracts from belief in His Oneness. Nevertheless, the teacher who has faith in His Oneness is able to enlighten each and every student according to his ability, as each student hears only that which is necessary for him and no more.
The teacher who teaches his students in a way that allows each one to hear only that which he needs to know—no less and no more—merits producing students who reveal the finest and choicest aspects of the Torah.
When a student hears a Torah lesson from his teacher and finds his will negated to that of his mentor’s, he can be certain that he has truly heard the teaching. For if his will was not negated, then, even if he heard—he did not hear. Another way for him to determine if he truly heard is if he experienced a total negation of self while listening [as the lesson was being given].
At the time a student comes to hear a Torah lesson from his teacher, the <i>kelipot</i> created by the student’s evil also come along to listen and draw sustenance [from the holiness]. But, as a result of each student hearing only that which applies to his soul, the <i>kelipot</i> flee and are thus prevented from hearing the lesson. There is, however, one semi-refined <i>kelipah</i> that is very close to holiness and flees only when the lesson includes an instance of Jewish salvation. Then it, too, runs away. This is alluded to in, “And Moses sent away his father-in-law” (Exodus 18:27); according to the opinion that Jethro [personifying the evil force that is very close to holiness] came and left before the Torah was given.
Verbally reciting the words of Torah saves one from punishment by stoning.
Not all places are conducive for studying Torah and performing good deeds. Because of this, God brings about circumstances that cause a person to leave one place and go elsewhere.
When a person labors in Torah study to the point of exhaustion, he mitigates harsh judgments and awakens mercy, even for his father who has passed away.
Torah brings to faith, and faith brings to sanctifying the Name of God.
Those with clear vision can tell who a person’s Torah teacher is merely by looking at him, provided they already know what his teacher looks like. When a student learns the Torah’s laws from his teacher, his face takes on a resemblance to the one teaching him. This is because Halakhah is the wisdom that makes a person’s face shine (cf. Ecclesiastes 8:1). By receiving the law, he receives a portion of his appearance, their resemblance increasing with each additional law the student receives.
God’s holiness validates and affirms the prominence of the generation’s leaders. This in turn brings everyone to value the <i>mitzvah</i> of hospitality, and the Torah scholars to merit having the law follow their opinion.
A rabbi who is stringent when advising others but lenient with himself, and who claims to be versed in a matter when he is not, will not merit seeing the splendor of the King. This is because the evil force of Edom—namely, improper fear—dims one’s sight and prevents him from seeing the splendor of the King’s countenance.

Slander

Part I

When a person is guilty of slander, the Holy One says to the ministering angel of hell, “I [will judge him] from above and you from below.” His rectification is to engage in Torah study and humble himself. This will also keep him from slandering further.

A person guilty of giving a fellow Jew a bad name is never pardoned.
A person guilty of slander cannot receive the Divine Presence.
Both the one who speaks slander and the one who accepts it deserve to be thrown to the dogs.
Reciting the Torah section on the Temple incense-offering (Exodus 30:34-38) is a rectification for slander.
A person guilty of slander will be afflicted with leprosy. His crime is so great, that it reaches the heavens and he deserves to be stoned.

When you are depressed, even your loved ones turn against you.
Strife is not found in a person’s home until the food runs out.

[Charging usury for lending money to a fellow Jew is considered wicked.] The borrower may then call him wicked, and is permitted to cut into his means of income, diminishing it by up to a third.
A person would rather die than have no friends and loved ones.
All things are created male and female, even kings. There are kings who embody the male aspect, and kings who embody the female aspect. They Holy One distances one from the other so that they do not [come together and] destroy the world.

There are certain well-known people whose fame comes mainly as a result of conflict and dispute.
A person involved in dispute succumbs to immoral desires.
Whoever defends his faith against many people who argue against him, countering them with convincing arguments, will, because of this, be worthy of many children. His progeny will fill the world.
One who is always scrutinizing the leaders of his generation and examining their behavior with an eye to finding fault will suffer from hunger. “Not a hunger for food” (Amos 8:11), but the hunger of the future, [a hunger for the word of God]. Thus the Hebrew word for hunger, רעב, is formed by placing an ע (<i>ayin</i>, which also means “eye”) between the letters רב (“rabbi” or “leader”).
By giving charity, a person can defeat his enemies through minimal means [and effort], as God will save him from even their greatest means [and effort].
Reciting Grace after Meals causes God’s greatness to become known in the world. Grace after Meals also brings the government tranquility from conflict and war.
When a person studies Torah with pure thoughts, so that he eats with such holiness that he is nourished by the sustenance of the angels, his enemies are sentenced to strangulation. This is alluded to [by the verses], “And it was on the third day, in the morning...” (Exodus 19:16); “then in the morning there was a layer of dew” (ibid. 16:13); “And it was at the morning watch...” (ibid. 14:24). <small>(I heard this explanation from the Rebbe’s holy mouth: ‘“And it was on the third day, in the morning’ was said during the Giving of the Torah and refers to a person who studies Torah with pure thoughts. ‘Then in the morning there was a layer of dew’ was said about the manna, the food from which the angels draw sustenance, as our Sages taught (see <i>Yoma</i> 75b). ‘And it was at the morning watch’ was said at the splitting of the Red Sea, when the Egyptians were drowned, which is an aspect of strangulation, as our Sages taught (see <i>Ketuvot</i> 30b).” Rebbe Nachman learned from one “morning” and applied it to the other, thereby deriving the above {insight} from the Torah.)</small>
The affliction and provocation that a sage suffers cause him to forget his learning.
As a result of quarreling, the less qualified students are accepted into positions of authority prematurely. This corresponds to a miscarriage, to a child being born too early. It leads to poverty and sometimes even death, God forbid.
Sometimes there is no peace in one’s home and all one’s family members are at odds with each other. Clearly, this is because there are evil forces in the house, and as a result his family suffers.
A person’s location can at times be the cause of the strife he encounters. This is similarly the reason one does not ask after the well-being of a fellow Jew in an unclean place.
Grief and depression lead to conflict, whereas joy brings peace to the world.
The Torah is revealed through peace.
If, while fasting, a person expends his energy on work or business, it saves him from enemies and murderers.
Whoever has enemies finds it difficult to concentrate while praying.
A person who causes a rift between husband and wife—talking to the husband about how beautiful his wife is, and telling the wife degrading things about her husband—will, because of his actions, find it difficult to earn a living.
When God sees that a certain Tzaddik has the ability to inspire people to devotional service, He stirs up opposition against him. God does this so that the Tzaddik will indeed succeed in inspiring others, which a Tzaddik without enemies cannot do. This can be likened to the times of Mashiach, when people will be at peace and coverts will no longer be accepted.
Thoughts of idolatry enable one’s enemies to overcome him.
One whose enemies are elevated succumbs to a lust for food.
A person whose body itches should realize that he has enemies. Sometimes, the abrasions and scratches he makes on his body [in attempting to relieve the itching] will save him from his enemies; this being in exchange for that.
There are two types of Tzaddikim: one whose words are the aspect of plowing, and one whose words are the aspect of reaping. Said otherwise, one Tzaddik’s speech corresponds to the male arousal for marital relations, while the other’s corresponds to drawing the seed into the womb, and fetal conception and gestation. Therefore, when there is a quarrel between these two Tzaddikim, an outsider should not meddle in their verbal exchanges, so as not to ruin the deeper intention.
A person with enemies should take an oath not to drink wine. This will give him mastery over them.
A <i>segulah</i> for a person hoping to be saved from his enemies, whether they are opponents in a dispute or highwaymen whom he fears, is to recite the cantillations that accompany the words of the Torah: <i>pashta, munach, zarka,</i> etc.

By returning to God in repentance, one earns his living easily.
One who fulfills “Your neighbor’s money should be as precious to you as your own” (Avot 2:12) merits praying with an attentive heart.
Living from the fruits of one’s own labor is so great, that one who does so recognizes God’s glory in a way that even the angels cannot.
The changes that take place in the angels—sometimes they are sitting and at other times standing, sometimes they appear as women and at other times as men, as well as all the other changes—are mirrored by the changes that take place in the flow of blessing that descends from heaven. Sometimes the blessings appear as fire, at other times as water, or as stone, or as any of the other forms. All of these changes affect both the world and man. A person’s will also alternates according to these changes, so that at times he wants one thing and at other times he wants something else.
One’s livelihood is in accordance with [the holiness of] one’s marital relations.

When the agent of someone important cannot convince an ordinary person to sell some object to his client, he should pray that the ordinary person accept the offer and agree to the sale.

When a new king or minister takes over, people’s livelihood is renewed and changes.
When a person’s livelihood comes from the business he does with gentiles during their holiday season, or even at other times of the year but involves his doing something that strengthens the worship of idolatry, his wife’s menstrual flow will begin soon after her ritual immersion.
A person who causes a rift between husband and wife—talking to the husband about how beautiful his wife is, and telling the wife degrading things about her husband—will, because of his actions, find it difficult to earn a living.
A person is sometimes spared having to rend his garment in mourning because his merchandise and property are spread out and not located in one area.

There will yet be a generation in the world that is entirely righteous.
Truth hastens the End of Days.
By keeping Shabbat a person draws upon himself the light of Mashiach. Repentance also has this power.

A Circumciser

Menstruation

Part I

A woman with an abnormally heavy menstrual flow will talk a lot. [To lessen the flow], she should refrain from appearing beautiful in public, bathe in spring water, and not overly exert herself—and her husband should perform the <i>mitzvah </i>of hand-washing meticulously. She should also avoid getting angry, and give charity after her ritual immersion—and her husband should study the tractate <i>Nidah</i> and afterwards recite the daily psalm [sung in the Holy Temple]. And she should wash herself with things brought up from the river’s depth, drink goat’s milk, scrub herself with [a brush of] goat’s hair when bathing, and perfume herself with frankincense.
A woman whose menstrual flow is heavy should write down the words <i>10)</i> לא אחד<i> echod),</i> [from the verse (Job 14:4), “Who can bring the pure from the impure? <i>Lo echod</i> (not one)”] and carry it around with her.

When one is appointed to be a tax collector, he falls from his level.

One makes his yearning for something evident through an oath.
When a person stumbles and falls, it is because he feels secure in his sinful behavior.

Because of the sin of obscene language, suffering and harsh decrees are renewed; the young men of Israel die, God forbid; and orphans and widows cry out, but are not answered.
Even a signed verdict for seventy years of good life is turned to evil when one uses obscenities. The bowels of hell are also deepened for him. This fate also awaits a person who hears [obscenities spoken] but remains silent.
Speaking obscenities is even worse than carrying out the act.

Benefitting from Others

Part I

Even though the money that a Tzaddik receives from an evil individual might be stolen money, the Tzaddik is permitted to accept it. This is so that this individual does not find himself some wicked scholar to call a Tzaddik, give him the money, and then oppose the true Tzaddik.
Once it became common practice to take gifts from others, the human lifespan grew shorter.

Song

When the fame of the Tzaddikim spreads in the world, new songs are composed.
The Levites had a particular song for each day of the week. Nowadays, being in exile, we no longer remember these tunes. Yet whenever some tragedy befalls any nation, it revives the particular tune of the Levites that countered this misfortune.
Tunes that contain the sound of weeping have the ability to free captives, as in, <i>“Motzee asirim bakosharote</i> (He releases prisoners at the most opportune times)” (Psalms 68:7). [The word <i>bakosharote</i> can be read as a compound of <i>be’khy</i> and <i>sheerote</i>—weeping and songs].
From the songs a person sings one can tell if he has dedicated himself to Torah study.
Drinking rouses a person to sing and play musical instruments, whereas eating does not. This is because [in the wilderness] the Jewish people sang the praise of God over the well, but not over the manna.

A Test

God tests a person in order to then grant him importance and fame.
When a person wants to inspire others to serve God, but lacks the requisite level of righteousness and has no ancestral merit, he should avoid being tested. He should particularly keep from arousing the jealousy of the wicked.
When a person controls his evil inclination, his children do not follow evil ways. Because of this his money is plentiful, and consequently he will not come to be tested.

An Eternal Flame

In reward for keeping a flame of olive oil burning constantly, people are spared from a decree of forced conversion.

Counting the Omer

Counting the Omer saves one from being banished.
During the weeks of Counting the Omer it is all the more important to immerse in a <i>mikvah</i> after a seminal emission.
Through counting the Omer it is possible to overcome an informer. This is alluded to by the word <i>L’OMeR,</i> which is an acronym for <i>“Me’igra Rama L’hira O’mikta</i> (from a high place down to a deep pit).”

Mysteries

By deeply studying the Torah’s mysteries one can bring barren women to bear children and also heal serious disease.

A Holy Book

When a person who is capable of authoring some holy work refrains from doing so, it is as if he remains childless.
Those who author holy works should carefully weigh the contents of their work to see that there is sufficient material for a book. For the value of any book comes only from those parts that were written through a “binding of souls,” as in, “This is the book of the lineage of man” (Genesis 5:1). If but a minimum of the book was written through such binding, it is not worthy of publication.
Those with insight are able to determine by looking into a holy book whether its original Torah teachings are solely the insights of the author, or they already existed, having been originated by another, but were insufficient for forming an entire work. [If it is the latter,] then the original ideas were revealed to this author so that he might bring them into print. Yet the truth is that he did not work for these insights, which came to him easily because someone else had already labored over them and brought them to light.
When a new book is printed, the crying it took to produce it—which is the aspect of “and mixed my drink with crying” (Psalms 102:10)—defeats the nations’ evil decrees and keeps them from overcoming us. Indeed, the essential strength of their rule stems only from the time Esau cried [when Jacob took his blessing]. This is alluded to in the verse, “And thus <i>mispar h’nai yisrael k’chol hayam</i> (the number of the Jewish people will be like the grains of sand in the sea)” (Hosea 2:1). [The word <i>mispar</i> can also be read <i>mi’sepher,</i> from a holy book; and the first letters of <i>B’nai Yisrael K’chol Hayam</i> spell <i>B’KhiYaH,</i> crying],
Whoever refrains from staring at women is rewarded with offspring who will author commentaries on the Torah.
It is actually beneficial for the world that many holy books written by righteous authors, including the Mishnaic Sages and other early Tzaddikim, have been lost and forgotten from the world. Their disappearance causes many books by apostates and heretics to be uprooted and erased from existence. The elimination of those holy works also eliminates any jealousy or enmity that exists between a husband and wife who conduct themselves with holiness.
When a great book appears in the world, it causes barren women to be remembered by God. This is alluded to in the verse, “This is the book of the lineage of man” (Genesis 5:1).

Hospitality is a <i>segulah</i> for restoring a woman’s menses.

A <i>segulah</i> for a person moving to a new house is to bring into it a sword, or a knife, or some other type of weapon. A hint to this is found in the verse, “A house is built with <i>ChoKhMah</i> (wisdom)” (Proverbs 24:3); the letters being an acronym for <i>“Klei Chamas Me’cheiroteihem</i> (weapons are their wares)” (Genesis 49:5). [The explanation of <i>me’cheiroteihem</i> is alternatively] “their swords” or “their places of dwelling.”
Apples are a <i>segulah</i> for women who have difficult births.

“Why do the Tzaddikim accept benefits from others so that their family members can live in affluence and splendor? Wouldn’t it be better to forgo such a lifestyle and not be obliged to take from others?” This should not trouble you.

In the merit of attending to the needs of a great person, one is saved from death.

A person’s fear of Heaven makes him yearn to draw closer to the Tzaddik.
Sitting at the table of the Tzaddik eliminates war.
A fraudulent person eventually joins those who oppose and quarrel with the Tzaddik.
There are times when the Tzaddik will contract leprosy because he has recently gotten some person to repent.
Whoever says of the Tzaddik that he is wicked, and of a wicked person that he is a Tzaddik, will fall ill. Through this he also causes an eclipse of the sun, and of the moon.
Binding oneself to the Tzaddik is a great healing.
It is very difficult for a person to achieve the assistance he needs when there is a Tzaddik in his city and he does not ask the Tzaddik to pray for him.
It sometimes happens that although a person is very close to the Tzaddik, he doesn’t feel any fear of God. He should know that were he not close to the Tzaddik, he would not even deserve to be alive.
There are times when the Tzaddik is too embarrassed to ask God to relieve his suffering. What does God do? He brings similar suffering upon a wicked person so that he comes to the Tzaddik and asks the Tzaddik to pray for him. In this way, the Tzaddik, too, is relieved of his suffering.
Whoever disagrees with a Tzaddik to his face clearly has no fear of Heaven.
Sometimes, the strife a Tzaddik encounters is definite proof of his righteousness.
There are wicked people who are successful. But when they persecute the Tzaddik, the evil forces themselves take revenge against them.
The difference between a Tzaddik and a person who fears God is that the God-fearing person is not given permission to reveal God’s secrets, whereas the Tzaddik is.
Whoever speaks against the Tzaddik clearly is arrogant.
When the Holy One wants a Tzaddik to teach the proper path to people, He indicates this to the Tzaddik through his livelihood.
TheTzaddik, while praying for a person, isable to understand which sin is the cause of that person’s particular misfortune.
One who guards his sexual purity certainly cherishes the Tzaddik.
When the Tzaddik serves God but shows no concern for teaching the common people, he will fall from his spiritual level.
By financially supporting the Tzaddik, all a person’s sins are pardoned, just as when the <i>Kohanim</i> eat from a sacrifice and the sins of the animal’s owners are atoned.

Part II

Telling stories about the Tzaddikim draws the light of Mashiach into the world. It also dispels much darkness and pain from the world. 
And the teller is rewarded with beautiful clothing.
During the seven days of mourning after the Tzaddik’s death, God fills the mourners with the light that has been hidden away since the Six Days of Creation.
It should not surprise you that a human being, despite being such a miniscule creation, has all the worlds dependent upon him. For this is true of wherever the Divine Presence resides: The little sustains the much.
Each person’s portion in the Garden of Eden is pictured in the shine of his face.
Generally, the God-fearing have to roam from place to place to obtain their livelihood.
There are times when a Tzaddik must wander from place to place so that he will later recall all of them when he enters the World to Come. Through this, prosperity will come to those places.
Whoever knows the names of the living descendants of the Tzaddikim knows everything that is going to happen.
A person who justifies the actions of others will have all his wishes fulfilled, without any interference.
When a Tzaddik loses his strength, so that he cannot fulfill the will of his Creator the way he once did, he should know that God no longer wants him to teach the path of repentance to the wicked.
The Tzaddik’s power is strongest when harsh judgment is mitigated—that is, through God’s Oneness.
When the fame of the Tzaddikim spreads in the world, new songs are composed.
When a person sacrifices himself for the Jewish people, his directives cannot be annulled. Whatever he decrees will come to be.
Tending to the needs of the Tzaddik brings freedom and nullifies curses.
Those close to God-fearing people similarly merit fear and <i>daat.</i>
When the Tzaddik becomes wealthy, the wicked return to God in repentance.
When God sees that a certain Tzaddik has the ability to inspire people to devotional service, He stirs up opposition against him. God does this so that the Tzaddik will indeed succeed in inspiring others, which a Tzaddik without enemies cannot do. This can be likened to the times of Mashiach, when people will be at peace and coverts will no longer be accepted.
There are two types of Tzaddikim: one whose words are the aspect of plowing, and one whose words are the aspect of reaping. Said otherwise, one Tzaddik’s speech corresponds to the male arousal for marital relations, while the other’s corresponds to drawing the seed into the womb, and fetal conception and gestation. Therefore, when there is a quarrel between these two Tzaddikim, an outsider should not meddle in their verbal exchanges, so as not to ruin the deeper intention.
When visiting a Tzaddik’s gravesite, a person needs some merit in order to gather the Tzaddik’s spirit and soul to the grave, so that it will be as if he were alive. Without this merit, the Tzaddik’s spirit and soul ascend on high to join the other Tzaddikim.
Mentioning the names of the Tzaddikim has the power to bring about a change in the Act of Creation, altering Nature. This is alluded to through [a combination of the verses]: “These are the generations of heaven and earth” (Genesis 2:4) and “These are the names of the Children of Israel” (Exodus 1:1).
One who knows of the Holy Land, who has really tasted the Land of Israel, can recognize in another whether he has been with the true Tzaddik for Rosh HaShanah. For when a person merits being with the true Tzaddik for Rosh HaShanah, wherever he focuses his attention he transforms the air there into an aspect of the air of the Land of Israel. Therefore, one who knows the taste of the Holy Land, each according to his own level, will of necessity feel the Land of Israel when he comes together with this person who has been with the true Tzaddik for Rosh HaShanah, through whom the air becomes an aspect of the Holy Land.

A Curse

Part I

Cursing brings to mourning, God forbid.
One may not curse another person unless he can foresee the future generations of the one he curses.
Do not take the curse of an ordinary person lightly.
It is the intention behind the curse that matters.
There are times when a Tzaddik’s curse lasts as long as he is alive, but not after he dies.
An unjustified curse eventually turns back on the curser.
The wise person’s curse, even if unjustified, and even if conditional, comes to be.
Even a gentile who blesses a Jew will be blessed.

Part II

A person who is always cursing comes from the World of Emptiness, while a person who is wont to bless is from the World of Rectification.
Investigating the World of Emptiness—namely, what is above and what is below, what preceded this world and what follows it—brings a curse. But guarding against such investigation brings blessing.
A person who is accustomed to cursing will not have clothing for Shabbat.
A curse has no effect on a person of distinguished ancestry.
Tending to the needs of the Tzaddik brings freedom and nullifies curses.
Conducting one’s business affairs faithfully nullifies curses.
When one person curses another during a time of panic, the curse proves very damaging.

Forces of Evil

Part I

The letters of the word <i>ATaH -</i> אתה - defeat the forces of evil.
Writing on parchment the verse, “God, when Your hand is uplifted, they will not see” (Isaiah 26:11), protects a woman who has just given birth.
Evil forces are prevalent in ruins and destroyed buildings.
The light of a candle overpowers the rule of the evil forces.
A person’s <i>mazal</i> protects him from harm.
Reciting the “seven voices” that David recited upon the waters (Psalm 29) subdues the evil spirit.
Harmful forces are as prevalent in ditches as they are in fields.
Demons frequent uninhabited places, even during the day. In the city, however, people need not fear even at night.
Many demons are revealed to a person out of the north.
Reading the Torah portion <i>Noah</i> is a <i>segulah</i> for chasing away the spirit of unholiness.
The breath of an evil person causes those who talk with him to turn vulgar and crass.

Part II

There are demons found in a person’s house that destroy domestic harmony by bringing anger and quarreling into the home. This is the why the woman is most often the initiator of dispute, as she is the essence of the home, as in: ‘“His house’ refers to his wife” (<i>Yoma</i> 2a). However, sometimes, the demons attach themselves to the other members of the household, causing them to suffer as a result of their quarreling and contentiousness. This is explicitly found in the verse, “Their homes are peaceful, without fear...” (Job 21:9), about which the Sages teach: “without fear”—these are the demons. And this is “peaceful, without fear,” because peace and fear are opposites; fear being the demons that destroy peace. Thus, the verse concludes, “and the rod of God is not upon them,” which alludes to the abovementioned suffering.

Envy and Jealousy

When envy is eliminated, it will herald the ingathering of the Jews from exile.
Jealousy brings to an outbreak of fires.
Envy leads to the shedding of innocent blood.
Anyone who is envious of another person’s wealth turns foolish.
Visiting the Tzaddik will eliminate your jealousy.
Jealousy causes a person’s bones to rot.
Garlic roots out envy.

One who spills his seed will in the end go naked.
Depression causes one to experience a seminal emission.
A person who is careful not to eat food about which there is some Halakhic question is protected from being made impure by a seminal emission.
One who has experienced a seminal emission should immerse in a <i>mikvah</i> before eating at the Tzaddik’s table.
Rejoicing in the good that befalls the Tzaddik is a rectification for wasting one’s seed.
By mocking others, a person will come to pollute himself with a seminal emission.
Wasting seed comes from frivolity.
A wasteful emission of seed is brought on by eating garlic and eggs, 
or by engaging in idle talk, or by using obscene language.

Part II

Drunkenness causes exile and leads to the wasteful emission of seed.
Embarrassment comes from having spilled one’s seed.
The inability to pronounce one’s words properly, speaking only half words, is the same aspect as the wasting of seed.
A man who experiences a seminal emission [should be concemed that] his children will die.
Reciting the following ten psalms on the day one experiences a seminal emission provides great remedy and rectification: Psalms 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, and 150. You can be certain that these ten psalms are very, very beneficial for rectifying this sin. A person who is careful to recite the psalms as prescribed needs no longer fear. He will definitely make the necessary amends, for these ten psalms are a very great rectification.

Difficulty in Childbirth

A woman who eats radishes during pregnancy will have difficulty giving birth.
Giving a woman to drink from the waters of seven wells is a <i>segulah</i> for preventing difficulty in childbirth.
[Other <i>segulot</i> that are beneficial for alleviating difficulties in childbirth are:] keeping her other children out of the house during labor, 
whispering the letters of the Holy Name <i>SaG</i> (<i>Yud Vav Dalet, Heh Yud, Vav Aleph Vav, Heh Yud</i>) into her ear, 
not placing her bed in the western or southern part of the room, 
and putting around her neck some bitter herbs leftover [from the Passover <i>Seder</i>].
Whispering into a woman’s ear the letters <i>peh aleph, vav aleph vav, ayin yud nun, heh aleph</i> is also [a <i>segulah</i> for easing the difficulties of childbirth].

Distancing the Wicked

Part I

The Tzaddik brings a blessing when he enters the house of a wicked person, but only if the house is suitable for a blessing.
Keep away from the wicked so that you won’t be caught up in their punishment.
Showing a bit of friendliness to the wicked is permitted in order to avoid hostility.
There are certain times when doing something good for a totally wicked person pleases God.
It is forbidden to praise the wicked. However, when such praise also reflects positively upon the Tzaddik, limited praise is permissible.
One who finds good in the wicked is also called wicked.
We do not rely on a wicked person even if he has done something properly and in accordance with Torah law.
Whoever stands as a guarantor for a wicked person succumbs to lustful desires and sickness.
A wicked person who has completely forsaken God clearly will never have worthy offspring.
Have no mercy on an enemy of God when he falls into your hands.
Avoid associating with people who are known for telling lies and you will be worthy of detecting deceivers.

The wicked joining forces is detrimental to one’s serving God.
It is fitting and right for God’s holy ones to create barriers and obstacles that will chase away all tyrannical and wicked people from them.

Part II

One who does not see through the deception of the wicked is detested [by God].
Imposters cause those whom they deceive to suffer pain of the eyes.
A person should avoid exchanging kisses with the wicked, for the kiss creates a bond that lasts even after death.
There are people who, despite being filled with heresy and atheism, are able to keep their thoughts hidden. [Their deception is so clever that] a person who comes in contact with them has no idea that he has to protect himself from them. However, when a person possesses the quality of modesty, he will be saved from such atheists.
The wicked disrupt our serving God more by the <i>mitzvot </i>they do than by the sins they commit. This is the reason a gentile who observes Shabbat deserves death.

Compassion and Mercy

Part I

Whoever shows compassion for the poor merits consolation from God. 
He will also always be victorious.
When there is no compassion, the world suffers from hunger. 
There is also an increase in theft.
A person who prays fervently merits having compassion for the poor.
One who has no compassion goes crazy.
One who repays bad with good lives a long life.

A person suffers a toothache because he has been cruel to animals.
Compassion is a <i>segulah</i> for eliminating depression.
A person should avoid inflicting pain upon living creatures, as this will bring him harm.

Vision

The eye can see only what it is allowed to see. Even if the thing is right in front of him, a person won’t notice it until he is granted permission from on high to see it.
The waning of the moon and its eclipse are damaging to those with weak vision.
Sanctifying the new moon is a <i>segulah</i> for curing weak vision.
Reciting <i>Tikkun Chatzot</i> is also a <i>segulah</i> for curing weak vision.
Pain of the eyes comes because a person has made some vow.
Imposters cause those whom they deceive to suffer pain of the eyes.
When an important person suffers pain of the eyes, he should know that either his son or his student has committed some sin.
Anyone who closes his eyes so as not to look at evil saves himself from humiliation.
A person who is afraid of immoral thoughts because of the beautiful women he sees while out in the street should recite the verse: “Behold, the mighty ones will cry outside” (Isaiah 32:7). This will save him from wandering eyes.
Staring at an <i>etrog</i> is a cure for pain of the eyes.
When those with clear vision look at the knives used by ritual slaughterers, they can see the vessels of the Holy Temple.
Those with clear vision can tell who a person’s Torah teacher is merely by looking at him, provided they already know what his teacher looks like. When a student learns the Torah’s laws from his teacher, his face takes on a resemblance to the one teaching him. This is because Halakhah is the wisdom that makes a person’s face shine (cf. Ecclesiastes 8:1). By receiving the law, he receives a portion of his appearance, their resemblance increasing with each additional law the student receives.
Pain of the eyes is sometimes harmful.
Stealing damages one’s vision.

Healing

Know! each and every herb has its own unique power to heal a specific illness. But this is only for a person who did not guard his faith and sexual purity, and did not keep from transgressing “Do not despise any man” (Avot 4:3). However, when one has complete faith and also maintains sexual purity and fulfills “Do not despise any man,” his cure is not dependent upon particular types of herbs. Rather, he is healed by all food and drink, as in “And He blessed your bread” (Exodus 23:25). He does not have to rely upon receiving particular herbs to be cured.
By deeply studying the Torah’s mysteries one can bring barren women to bear children and also heal serious disease.
Salty things aggravate leprosy, whereas fresh water cures it. This is alluded to in the verse (Job 36:27), “When He diminishes the drops of water”—namely, leprosy, which stems from blood overpowering the water in the body—then, <i>“yazoku matar I’eido</i> (the rain is distilled into His cloud).” The word <i>yazoku,</i> “distilled,” can alternatively be translated as “causing harm.”
Staring at an <i>etrog</i> is a cure for pain of the eyes.

Joy and Happiness

Part I

Part II

A person with a burning desire to work the land will come to one of three things: bloodshed, leprosy or drunkenness.
Drunkenness causes exile and leads to a wasteful emission of seed.
When a person gets drunk, mishap becomes inevitable.
A person who gets drunk forgets the directives of our teacher, Moses. This is because Moses is enclothed in the 248 organs of the human body and he instructs each and every organ to heed the <i>mitzvot</i> applicable to it. This is the reason Moses was called <i>m’chokek</i> (lawgiver), which has a numerical value of 248.
Drunkenness strips the mind from the <i>chassadim</i> (benevolences) that enclothe it, and covers it in powerful judgments, God forbid.
A person with enemies should take an oath of abstinence from wine. This will give him mastery over them.

Public Officials

When a person sells diluted wine, public officials will treat him unfairly.
Not judging a fellow Jew favorably is tantamount to killing him. One who does so will be treated unjustly by public officials.
Reciting the <i>Hallel</i> prayer and giving charity are a <i>segulah</i> for finding favor in the eyes of public officials.
Eating bread baked by a non-Jew causes [those in charge] to prohibit using the forest to chop firewood.
There are four things that cause a person’s possessions to be handed over to the government: [holding on to a paid IOU, charging usury for lending money, being in a position to object to some wrongdoing and not doing so, and pledging charity in public but not giving it].

Bribery

A city in which the people take bribes will be set upon by invading armies.
Bribery causes a person’s prominence to disappear.
Bribery leads to an outbreak of fires.

Peace

Lighting Shabbat candles promotes peace.
By pursuing peace, a person will be rewarded with honor in this world and life in the World to Come.
Anything that is done to foster peace does not fall into the category of “distance yourself from falsehood.”

Swearing falsely causes a person to fall from faith.
Studying the tractate <i>Shavuot</i> is a <i>segulah</i> for bringing rainfall.
Swearing falsely leads to immoral thoughts.
A person who is always taking oaths will be constantly bothered by evil thoughts.
Victory in battle cannot be achieved when an oath has been broken.
Whoever violates an oath clearly has no respect for God-fearing people.

Swearing falsely will destroy even those things that fire and water cannot.
The angel Gabriel has been put in charge of fire, to destroy as well as to save.

The Sabbath

Studying Torah, giving tithes and observing Shabbat provide material benefits as well.
A person who is accustomed to cursing will lack clothing for Shabbat.
When a city’s inhabitants are careful not to walk beyond the Shabbat limit [from the city’s edge], meat will sell cheaply there.
By keeping Shabbat a person draws upon himself the light of Mashiach. Repentance also has this power.
A person who observes Shabbat is like a son who apologizes to his father and is given everything he wants. Such a person can also decree and the Holy One will give him what he wants. In addition, the reward he enjoys for his good deeds is drawn against his earnings, whereas the principal remains intact for him to enjoy in the World to Come.

Sleep

The holier a person is, the less sleep he requires.
Too much sleep and slumber causes a person to be pushed away from the seat of holiness. His face changes and his Godly image is marred.
Reciting each of the fifteen psalms that begin “A song of ascent” (Psalms 120-134) is a <i>segulah</i> for eliminating sleepiness.
A person who finds that he cannot sleep should think about his belief in the resurrection of the dead.

A Ritual Slaughterer

When ritual slaughterers are devout, [the meat they provide brings] people to have compassion for one another. The inverse is also the case, [as the meat of ritual slaughterers who are not devout causes people to lack compassion].
When a ritual slaughterer fulfills the commandment to honor one’s father, God protects him from inadvertently distributing non-kosher meat. The inverse is also the case, [as transgressing this commandment leads to his inadvertently distributing non-kosher meat].
Wicked slaughterers who distribute non-kosher meat bring about an increase of theft in the world.
When those with clear vision look at the knives used by ritual slaughterers, they can see the vessels of the Holy Temple.
A person who suddenly loses his ability to speak should have a knife fit for ritual slaughtering passed over his mouth.

Repentance

Part I

Fasting is beneficial for all things.
A person who is devoid of good deeds cannot get others to separate from their evil ways.
Fasting is harder [on the body] than the sword.

When a person is humble, it is as if he offered all the various sacrifices.

By bringing merit to the masses a person becomes God’s partner in Creation.
A <i>mitzvah,</i> no matter how great, which a person does and thereby brings merit only to himself cannot compare to even a minor <i>mitzvah</i> through which he brings merit to the masses.
[Insufficient] income, enemies, sickness and great wealth are obstacles that deter a person from attaining perfection and his ultimate purpose.

During a person’s lifetime it is impossible for him to know if his repentance has been accepted.
We often see that a person is beset by suffering when he begins serving God. The reason for this is that his initial motivation stemmed from his fear of justice.
When a person begins serving God, the Holy One says to him: “I know that your desire and will is to serve Me, but what assurances do I have that tomorrow you won’t leave Me? If so, how can I draw you closer by virtue of your will alone? And how can I immediately reveal hidden things to you? Rather, you must do as follows: Start by showing your love for Me in the present situation, and perform My <i>mitzvot </i>even though you do not comprehend them. And serve Me with simplicity, without sophistication. After you’ve done this for some time, I will then believe you and reveal to you the reason and wisdom behind each and every thing. I will also draw you closer in all kinds of ways. For the extended time you served Me previously will guarantee that you won’t leave Me.”
The way a person can tell that he truly wants to serve God is that he has no desire for recognition.
Whoever doesn’t know the way of God should humble himself.
By crying out your prayers God will forgive you.
Falsehood prevents a person from improving his ways.

Repentance brings healing to the world.

Repentance hastens the Final Redemption and lengthens a person’s days and years.
When an individual repents, he is forgiven and so is the whole world.

Rebuke mitigates harsh judgment and promotes loving-kindness.

Part II

When a person wants to inspire others to serve God, but lacks the requisite level of righteousness and has no ancestral merit, he should avoid being tested. He should particularly keep from arousing the jealousy of the wicked.
Anyone who brings those distant from God to serve Him is given the power to bless others.
A person who rejects rebuke should know that he will have to borrow from others. This is alluded to through [a combination of the verses in Proverbs]: “Words of rebuke will not move a slave to correct his ways” (29:29), and “A borrower becomes a slave to the lender” (22:7).
One person will not be able to convince another of anything unless he first attaches his soul to that of the other person.
Going out to greet an important person summons forth the Ten Statements through which the world was created. Bringing Jews who are distant from God closer to Him does this as well.
