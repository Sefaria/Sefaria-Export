            "27": "The reason women are exempt from time-triggered positive commandments is that a woman is subjugated to her husband fo rthe fulfillment of his needs. If she were obligated to perform time-triggered commandments, it might happen that just when she is performing the commandment her husband will command her to do his bidding. If she were to fulfill the command of the Creator and ignores his [her husband's] command, woe to her from her husband! And if she were to fulfill his command and ignore that of the Creator, woe to her from her Maker! Therefore the creator exempted her from his commandments, so that she can be at peace with her husband."

                "28": "A person blesses these three blessings each day: the first is <b>who has not made me a gentile</b>, since \"All nations are as naught in His sight; He accounts them as less than nothing\" (Isaiah 40:17). The second is <b>who has not made me a [Canaanite] slave</b> since the slave is not commanded in positive commandments which are caused by time, and further, that they have no merit of ancestry, since their ancestors did not stand at Mount Sinai. And further, that we do not believe them, since \"the more slaves, the more theft\" (Pirkei Avot 2:7). And further, that it is forbidden for a slave to marry a Jewish woman, and that a slave is close to a gentile. The Rama\"h questions if a convert blesses \"who has not made me a gentile\" and if a captive blesses \"who has not made me a slave\", and replies that so we have seen, the blessing applies specifically to the beginning of the creation of man, and as such a convert does not bless \"who has not made me a gentile\" except when they were entirely born and bred (pregnancy and birth) in holiness [Judaism]. But the captive blesses \"who has not made me a slave\", since this blessing was not established for slavery itself but rather since the slave is not obligated in commandments like a Jew, and is not fitting to enter the community [marry into it], and is unsuitable for many things. And the third blessing is <b>who has not made me a woman</b>, since she is not commanded in positive commandments that are caused by time as we have explaned in the introduction to this book. The man is similar to a labourer who enters a field and plants with permission, and the woman is similar to one who enters a field without permission. And further, that the fear of her husband is upon her and she is unable to perform even that which she is commanded in. And women are accustomed to bless instead of \"who has not made me a woman\", \"who has made me according to His will\", like one who justifies the Judgement regarding the evil that has come upon them.\n"
