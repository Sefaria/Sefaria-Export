This is not custom to bring except to the temple and in the land of Israel, as it says (Exodus 23:19, 34:26): \"Beginning of the fruit of your land you shall bring to the house of Hashem your G-d\". And those who bring first fruit from the cities of Sichon and Og and from Syria. For one who buys from Syria is as if buying from Jerusalem. [But from Amon, Moab and Babylonia], even though they are obligated in Tithes, they are not brought for Bikkurim. And if one brought Bikkurim from outside of the land of Israel, they are not considered Bikkurim."

So too, priests and levites bring and read because they have open cities."
