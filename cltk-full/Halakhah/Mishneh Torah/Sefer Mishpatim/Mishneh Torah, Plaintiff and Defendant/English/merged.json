            "9": "One was holding the fringes of the garment, the other was holding the other fringes, they split it equally after swearing upon it. And all divisions mentioned here are in value, so as not to devalue the vessel or garment itself or to kill the animal.", 
            "8": "Two people are holding a garment, one says it's all mine and the other says it's all mine. One takes until the place that his hand grabs, the other takes until the place that his hand grabs, and the remainder is split after they swear upon it. And they both have the ability to make the other swear that all he has taken he has taken lawfully.", 
            "11": "If two came holding it [a garment] and one grabs it from the other in front of us [Beit Din] and the second is quiet, even if he later protests we don't take it from him [the first one], since he [the second one] was quiet at first, it's as though he admitted to him [that the garment was his]. If the second went back and grabbed it from the first, even though the first protests from the beginning to the end, we divide it.", 
            "6": "Two that were holding one vessel or riding upon one animal, or one was riding and the other guiding, or sitting next to a pile of wheat placed in an alley, or a courtyard belonging to both of them. He says \"all of it is mine\" and he says \"all of it is mine\". Each one of them swears while holding an [holy] object that he has at least half of it, and they split it. And this oath is a decree of the Sages so that people will not grab their fellow's garment and take it without an oath."

            "3": "One who makes a partial admission is not obligated to take an oath until he admits something he could have denied. How so? The plaintiff claimed that he was owed one hundred Dinars, fifty in this bill and fifty without, and the defendant responded \"I do not owe you but this fifty in the bill\" -- he is not one who has made a partial admission, for his denial of the bill shall have no effect, and all his assets are security for the loan, and if he denied he would still have to pay, therefore he takes a rabbinic oath on the [remaining] fifty."
