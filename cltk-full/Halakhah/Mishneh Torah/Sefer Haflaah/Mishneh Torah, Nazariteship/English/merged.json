Accordingly, if anyone has vowed nowadays to become a nazirite, he becomes a lifelong nazirite, for we have no Temple where he might offer his sacrifices on the day his term as nazirite is completed.",
            "20": "Naziriteship is observed only in Eretz Yisrael. If a man took the nazirite vow in the Diaspora, he is fined and compelled to go to Eretz Yisrael to be a nazirite there for the number of days he specified in the nazirite vow.— —",
            "21": "As long as he is outside Eretz Yisrael, he is forbidden to drink wine, defile himself for the dead, or cut his hair; he must observe all the details of naziriteship, even though these days are not counted. If he transgresses by drinking wine, cutting his hair, touching a corpse or the like, he is to be lashed."

He was forbidden to drink wine and cut his hair, but was permitted to defile himself for the dead. This, too, is based on tradition.",
            "13": "Accordingly, if anyone said: \"I will be a nazirite like Samson,\" he becomes a lifelong nazirite, kept from cutting his hair and drinking wine. He must not cut his hair every twelve months, like other lifelong nazirites, but he may defile himself for the dead.— —"

If, however, one vows to God in a way of holiness, he does a good thing and deserves praise. Concerning such a man it is written: \"His consecration to God is upon his head … he is consecrated to the Lord\" (Numbers 6:7-8). Scripture considers him the equal of a prophet, as it is written: \"I raised up some of your sons as prophets, and some of your young men as nazirites\" (Amos 2:11)."
