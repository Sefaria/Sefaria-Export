                "0": "“Slaughter from your cattle…as I have commanded you”:  Not at all times, but only periodically, when the desire becomes strong.  And what was said, “just as the gazelle and the deer are eaten, so may you eat them” (Deuteronomy 12:22), and as it said, “When one hunts game of an animal or bird” (Leviticus 17:13), and our Sages said, “the Torah taught proper behavior, that a person should eat meat only on this kind of occasional basis” (Talmud Bavli Chullin 84a 46).  The explanation of the matter is that if people accustom themselves to eating the animals present in the home, ox, sheep, or goat, then all day they will have desire and will accustom themselves to eat it on a daily basis, but they don’t eat it until they hunt game of animals or birds in the forest or desert, where there is danger and great effort to hunt them, then their desire will be calmed, because the eating isn’t worth the great pain and effort."

                "2": "And this is also a reason for this <i>hakhel</i> (assembly). As in addition to the taking of these four species on the first day of the festival, God commanded to make another impression similar to [the impression made by] it, at the end of seven years. Since the seventh year also causes assembly and peace by way of one not planting and growing upon it. And the destitute of His people eat on it, since the [landowners] are not permitted to hold on to their produce on the seventh year as [would usually be the way of] an owner. And without a doubt, this is is a cause of peace, since all disagreements are from the trait of \"what's mine is mine\" [and] \"this one says, 'it is all mine.'\" And this is not so [prevalent] on the seventh year, since [even if] in the positive acts, not all are equal, in the negative acts, all are equal, and this is truly the way of peace. And so [too] with the festival of Sukkot, when everyone goes out from a permanent dwelling to a temporary dwelling and sits under the 'Sukkah (hut) of His peace.' Behold, [accordingly] on the first of the intermediate days, the king was commanded to make an impression about peace and this is the matter of <i>hakhel</i>. As all of this is a preparation to repentance, and [so] he reads from Deuteronomy words of exhortation and rebuke. And this is [the meaning of] what they said, \"'the men' to learn, etc, 'the youngsters' - why are they coming, to bring reward to those that bring them.\" Since in the time when Israel repents, they offer supplications in front of Him, may He be blessed, for the forgiving of sin and say, \"If not for our sake, then do it for the sake of those weaned from their mothers, who have not sinned.\" [This is] as it is found in the text of 'Avinu Malkenu' - Have mercy on our sucklings and on our youngsters. And we [also] say, \"Do it for those weaned from their mothers, etc.\" And this is the reward that is given to those that bring them, from the youngsters - that they will say in front of Him, may He be blessed, \"Do it for the sake of these youngsters that are brought to the House of God,\" in the same way as it stated in Joel 2:16, \"Collect the people, sanctify the assembly, gather the elders, collect the sucklings, and those that suck the breasts, etc."
