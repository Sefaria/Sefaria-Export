His ministers a flaming fire.\" (Psalm 104, 4.)",

He sealed them with spirit and fastened them to His great name and sealed with it six dimensions. 5) He sealed the height and turned towards above, and sealed it with יהו. 6) He sealed the depth, turned towards below and sealed it with היו 7) He sealed the east and turned forward, and sealed it with ויה  8) He sealed the west and turned backward, and sealed it with והי 9) He sealed the south and turned to the right and sealed it with יוה 10) He sealed the north and turned to the left and sealed it with הוי.
