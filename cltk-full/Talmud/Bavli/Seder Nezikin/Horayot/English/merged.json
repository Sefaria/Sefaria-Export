Gamaliel's bread was finished he depended on R. Joshua's flour. He said to him: Did you know, that we would be so delayed that you brought flour ? He said to him: Every 70 years a star appears that confuses the (ships) [sailors], so I said to myself: perhaps this star will appear and confuse us. He said to him: So much is in your control, yet you board a ship.  Instead of marveling at me, marvel about the two disciples you have on land, R. Eleazar Hisma and R. Yohanan b. Gudgada,  who are able to calculate how many drops are in the sea, and yet don't have bread to eat or clothes to put on. He decided to appoint them to leadership positions.  When he got back to land he sent for them, but they didn't come. He sent for them again and they came. He said to them: \"Do you imagine that I was offering you rulership? "
