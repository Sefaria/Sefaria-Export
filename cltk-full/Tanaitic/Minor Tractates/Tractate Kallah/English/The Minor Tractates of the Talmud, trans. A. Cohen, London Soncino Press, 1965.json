In the Talmudic period betrothal (<i>’erusin</i>) and marriage (<i>ḳiddushin</i>) denoted two stages different from what they are now. <i>’Erusin</i> took place in the bride’s home and <i>ḳiddushin</i> subsequently in the bridegroom’s home. It is important to note that the ceremony of <i>’erusin</i> was binding upon the bridal couple and could not be dissolved without a bill of divorce. Later the current custom prevailed whereby the two ceremonies were combined and performed at the same time (cf. P.B., pp. 298f., the benediction on the first of the pages being of <i>’erusin</i>).</i> is forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This consisted of seven benedictions.

Whence is the benediction of bridegrooms derived from the Torah? As it is stated, <i>And they blessed Rebekah</i>.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gen. 24, 60.</i> And whence do we derive that even a widow is so forbidden?<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On remarriage without the benediction, cf. Keth. 7a (Sonc. ed., p. 26).</i> As it is stated, <i>And he took ten men of the elders of the city … And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said, We are witnesses.

This is the view of R. Eliezer, but R. Joshua said: Not until the matter is examined—if she was <i>niddah</i> while still in her father’s house, she is forbidden [to her husband], but if not she is allowed to him.<br>R. Eliezer was asked, ‘Is it permissible to drink from the hand of the bride so long as her husband is sitting with her at the festive table?’ He replied, ‘Whoever drinks from the hand of a bride is as though he drinks from the hand of a harlot’. [His colleagues] said to him, ‘Are not all the daughters of Israel possessed of good manners?’<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And it is therefore usual for a bride to hand things to the guests.</i> He answered, ‘God forbid! Anyone who is not familiar with the Torah<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And since women are not usually learned in the Torah it cannot be assumed that they possess good manners.</i> cannot be possessed of good manners’. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public declaration accompanied by the sounding of three hundred <i>shofars</i>,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In K.R. I, 5, below p. 418 the reading is ‘four hundred <i>shofars</i>’. These were sounded to increase the solemnity of the declaration.</i> ‘Whether a bride be of the daughters of a scholar or of an <i>‘am ha-’areẓ</i>, he who drinks from her hand is as though he drinks from the hand of a harlot’. He further said, ‘Whoever takes a cup from the hand of a bride and drinks from it has no share in the World to Come’.",

Thy children have made me as a harp upon which scorners play’. To this He replies, ‘My daughter, when they rejoice what should they do?’ She makes the rejoinder, ‘Sovereign of the universe! If he is a scholar let him occupy himself with the Torah, with study and good deeds and <i>’aggadoth;</i> let students of Scripture occupy themselves with Scripture, students of Midrash and Mishnah with the laws of Passover on Passover, the laws of Pentecost on Pentecost and the laws of Tabernacles on Tabernacles’. R. Simeon<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">GRA adds ‘b. Eleazar in the name of R. Joshua b.

He sat in confusion and exclaimed, ‘Woe is me! Perhaps I have incurred the penalty of death at the hand of Heaven’. While he was still sitting in a troubled state of mind, the executioner came and told him, ‘Master, it has been decreed against you that you be wrapped in [a scroll of] your Torah and be burnt with it’.<sup>91</sup><i class=\"\">(91) So GRA. V has ‘wrapped and burnt with your Torah and to Israel your people’. Cf. Semaḥoth VIII, 11.</i> He arose and they wrapped him in his [scroll of the] Torah and surrounded him with bundles of twigs. When the fire caught sight of him, it cooled down and removed itself from him. Whereupon the executioner rose up in amazement and asked him, ‘Master, are you the man condemned to be burnt?’ He replied, ‘Yes’. He then asked him, ‘Why has the fire gone low?’ He replied, ‘I adjured it in the name of my Creator that it should not touch me until I know whether it was so decreed against me in Heaven. Wait one hour and I will let you know’. The executioner was sitting in wonderment and said [to himself], ‘Why should persons who decree death and life for themselves<sup>92</sup><i class=\"\">(92) Through their adherence to the Torah.</i> be subject to the yoke of [the Roman] government?’ He said [to R. Ḥanina,] ‘Arise and go, and whatever the government desires to do to me let it be done’. He replied, ‘You foolish man! Heaven has approved the sentence passed on me, and if you do not kill me God has many slayers, [e.g.] many bears, leopards, lions, wolves, many serpents and scorpions to attack me. Ultimately, however, God will exact from you punishment for my blood’. Thereupon the executioner understood that such was the [divine] method;<sup>93</sup><i class=\"\">(93) That God would hold him responsible although he only acted under the orders o his government.</i> so he jumped up and fell into the fire. From the midst of the fire he shouted,<sup>94</sup><i class=\"\">(94) The reading of GRA has been followed.
