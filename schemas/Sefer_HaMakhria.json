    "enDesc": "Sefer HaMakhria is a 13th-century talmudic commentary written by the Italian tosafist Isaiah d'Trani, also known as Tosafot Rid (HaZaken) after the name of his best-known work. Sefer HaMakria contains 92 chapters of varying lengths, each of which cites a passage from the Talmud and then analyzes the passage and its legal ramifications, often in dialogue with explanations of other scholars. One of these is Rashi, often referred to by the author as HaMoreh.",
