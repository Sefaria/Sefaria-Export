    "enDesc": "Halachic compilation written by Rabbi Asher ben Yechiel, a German and Spanish halakhic authority (c. 1250 - 1327). Similar in style to Sefer HaHalachot of the Rif, Piskei HaRosh contains an abstract of the Talmudic text, leaving out the intermediate discussion and focusing on the final, practical halakha.  Having been a leader in both Germany and Spain, the Rosh was familiar with the leading halakhic authorities of both countries and included teachings from both. The Rosh’s commentary displays his independence of judgement as he states his legal opinion according to what he views as most sound, even if it goes against other respected authorities. The importance of this work can be seen from the fact that it is one of the three major Halakhic sources that R' Yosef Karo consulted (along with Rif and Rambam) when determining the final ruling in his Shulchan Arukh.",
