    "enDesc": "Alon Bakhut is a running commentary in Hebrew on the book of Eikhah (Lamentations), written by kabbalist and homilist Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz. It has often been printed along with the author’s commentary on the haftarot, Ahavat Yehonatan, including in the version appearing on Sefaria. The work’s title means “tree of weeping” and was the name given to the tree under which Rebecca’s nurse was buried (Genesis 35:8). The sorrow expressed in that verse became one of several biblical models for thinking about mourning, and relates thematically to Jeremiah’s lament in Eikhah over the destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem.",
