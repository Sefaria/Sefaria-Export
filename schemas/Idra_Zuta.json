    "enDesc": "Idra Zuta, or “Small Gathering,” is a kabbalistic work that is typically printed as part of the Zohar. It serves as a continuation of the “Idra Rabba,” or “Large Gathering,” at which Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai first revealed mystical secrets to his followers. Three participants didn’t survive that ecstatic experience, so when Rabbi Shimon reconvened the group on the day of his death, it was smaller – hence the name “Small Gathering.” Idra Zuta describes Rabbi Shimon joyously sharing mystical secrets he had previously withheld, in order to pass into the next world “unashamed.”",
