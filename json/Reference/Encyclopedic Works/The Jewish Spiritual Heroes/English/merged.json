            "Introduction": [
                "T<small>HE HISTORY OF A PEOPLE</small> is primarily constructed out of the biographies of those individuals whose activities characterize the specific nature of the progress and development of the national forces, both internal as well as external.",
                "No prominent person can be entirely detached from his environment. It makes but little difference whether such a person influenced the environment in which he lived or whether his individuality was conditioned by it, for this type of influence is mutual and complementary. Just as the individual presents a picture of his environment in miniature, even so does an environment present a composite photograph of its component individual parts.",
                "Every person develops in a different manner; neither does this development follow an unbroken path from beginning to end. Life, on the contrary, follows some very devious ways and the chronicler must find a suitable approach for each complex historical situation in order not to go astray.",
                "“World history is the history of heroes,” is the claim of a German philosopher. This rule also applies to Jewish history with this difference that our heroes are generally “spiritual heroes,” master navigators of the deep and stormy literary sea and commanders on the battle fields of the Torah.",
                "Especially heroic were the struggles of our spiritual heroes of the time when we lost our political independence and were becoming accustomed to the role of a wandering people which is forced to live in a foreign environment but insists on retaining its own mode of life.",
                "World history is motivated by an eternal force which flows in an endless labyrinth of channels and is given form and direction by the leading spirits of each generation. It is therefore necessary, first of all, to observe the ways of the leading spirits rather than the events which transpire.",
                "The historical development of a people contains no accidents. Every event has its cause and reason which are results of previous events. It is therefore important to bear in mind that a matter of fact relation of events is not as significant as the understanding of the spirit and the logical necessity of such an event. We must also remember that ever since we lost our homeland the spirit of our people has found its expression in ideas and theories.",
                "* * *",
                "Concerning the Talmud in the form that it was taught in Babylonia (and therefore called the Babylonian Talmud) as well as in the form in which it was expounded in Palestine (and therefore called the Jerusalem Talmud), is recognized as the exclusive creation of the Jewish spirit to which the Gentile world can lay no claim.",
                "As far as the Bible is concerned we are confronted with various accusations. The enemies of Jewry find it undignified to admit that the Jews are the creators of the greatest spiritual treasure which the civilized world possesses. They therefore claim that the Bible is not specifically Jewish. The liberal legislation of the Pentateuch and the noble ideals of the prophets, they say, have been borrowed from neighboring peoples. When they do recognize the greatness of the Bible, they give equal credit to other peoples.",
                "The style of the Bible is today the possession of all civilized peoples and has become a fructifying element in every language; but the Talmud could not be taken away from us and the honor of being the creators of this great work will remain with us forever.",
                "Seven centuries passed from the time of Simon the Just, the last of the members of the “Great Synagogue” or “Great Assembly,” when the oral law became popular among the masses of the people until the conclusion of the Talmud. On the foundations of the Torah there was erected an imposing structure—an eternal monument to Jewish spirit as it developed in those seven centuries. This development began immediately after the conclusion of the Bible when the Jews lived on the soil of Palestine for the second time and even continued in Babylonia where they sought refuge and found freedom and happiness for many years. It lasted even in Babylonia until they had to flee the sword.",
                "Seven centuries is a long time in the life of any nation, even in the life of such an old nation as the Jews are. For no matter how conservative our historical evaluation it would be impossible to assume that no changes occurred during seven centuries. As among other nations, so also among the Jews there appeared new ideas and new concepts during these centuries. In the course of the years these new ideas developed and spread, only to disappear later on and to be supplanted by others. This is especially true when we consider that we are dealing with a time when the political conditions of the nation changed radically. At times the Jews lived freely in their own land and at other times they were involved in wars, at times they were exiled from their own country and at other times they prospered in other lands.",
                "It may also be stated with certainty that in all Jewish history there never was a period so involved and characterized by unusual events as were the seven centuries during which the Talmud was created. The sources of information concerning that period are very meager and every historian must fall back on his imagination in order to complete the picture that was handed down to us.",
                "If one wants to establish the true facts concerning events which took place at that time from the information contained in Talmudic literature, he must bear in mind that these books were not written with the aim of presenting history. They were therefore not careful to present exact dates or precise information regarding the people of whom they wrote. Whenever history is dealt with, it is generally embellished with many legends and even the personalities of the heroes are not definite.",
                "For our purpose the event which occurred may be of paramount importance but the authors stressed a personality; in other cases we may be interested in a personality while they stressed the event. It is also necessary to remember that the original text of the books regarding historic events and names of persons was not strictly adhered to. There therefore exist in the Talmud numerous versions pertaining to people and events. Thus we read a story regarding a certain Talmudic personality, but another version may vary by one word and change the sense of the event to have involved another person or to have occurred in a different manner.",
                "Such variations could easily creep into the Talmudic books when the copyists made an error in transcribing a name or when they sought to shorten their work and employed abbreviations which can be interpreted in numerous ways. These errors are not so important in establishing a law. It makes but little difference if the name of the person who rendered the deciding opinion regarding a law was misspelled. But where we are concerned with establishing historical facts, such errors are very confusing.",
                "The basis for the Talmud was provided by the “Sofrim.” These were the copyists of the Torah who were at the same time teachers explaining the sayings of the Torah to the people. The original text of many commandments was not very clear and could not be understood unless they were interpreted. But the interpretations of the Sofrim became accepted and on the foundation of their explanations there grew an organization of seers and elders which came to be called “The Men of the Great Synagogue.”",
                "The Great Synagogue acted as a Supreme Court in deciding all religious matters and it was presided over by the High Priest. The beginning of the Great Synagogue occurred in the time of the last prophets (Haggai, Zacharias, Malachi) when the people, under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemia, signed a written covenant to observe the laws of Judaism, and it ended with Simon the Just.",
                "At first it was prohibited to put the interpretations of the Sofrim in writing and they were handed on orally. Later it became obvious that they would be forgotten and so they began to write down all the traditional interpretations to the commandments of the Torah and they were considered as laws which God orally instructed Moses from Mount Sinai. But before this was done the Bible was completed in twenty-four books so that no one should try to add any of the traditional interpretations to its text.",
                "Even today it is difficult to establish with certainty the time of the duration of the Great Synagogue. Of the history of the second Temple we lack the chronicles of the events of a period covering about 200 years (from the time of Alexander the Great till the reign of Antiochus). All we know is that it was a time of turbulent political changes and that control of Palestine changed hands several times. It is considered that these were the years of the Great Synagogue.",
                "Ezra the Cohen and Scribe was the greatest scholar of the Torah of that time. When he observed that the Jews did not faithfully follow the commandments he tore his clothes, gave himself over to fasting and grew melancholy. Later there arrived Nehemiah Ben Chachalia, the cup bearer of Artaxerxes, and together they introduced regulations which later became laws. Their first move was to nullify all mixed marriages and to expel the non-Jewish wives together with their children. They were strict in preserving the purity of the race in spite of the fact that the richest and most prominent Jews, not excluding the family of the High Priest, intermarried with non-Jews.",
                "The main achievement of the Great Synagogue was in purifying the Jewish faith from imitation of the customs of other peoples which the Jews at that time freely engaged in. In order to prevent a return to idol worshipping, as occurred in the time of the first Temple, the Great Synagogue prohibited the erection of altars for offering sacrifices outside of Jerusalem. Instead they established prayers by means of which a person could praise his Creator in a few heart-felt words without having to resort to the blood of a sacrificed animal to attain nearness to God. The Talmud indirectly refers to this achievement when it states that the Great Synagogue killed the “Tempter” of idol worship. Of equal importance were the regulations of the Great Synagogue regarding inter-family marriages of which the Talmud says that “they captured the ‘Tempter’ of love and blinded his eyes.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא ס״ט ב׳.</span></i>",
                "In addition the Great Synagogue established the correct form of every word in the Bible. They introduced the custom of having all the inhabitants of the villages surrounding Jerusalem meet every Monday and Thursday to hear the reading of a chapter of the Torah. In Jerusalem itself the whole weekly portion was read every Saturday. They established a new calendar so that the count of years should begin with Tishri instead of Nisan, and that the day of the blowing of the ram’s horn, the first day of Tishri, should be the New Year.",
                "Many of the old institutions of the Temple were dispensed with. Thus no “Cherubim” were made for the second Temple because when Nebuchadnezzar’s soldiers destroyed the first Temple they carried out the Cherubim and exhibited them as the Jewish God. The Jubilee was also done away with; since it was prohibited to hold Jewish slaves it was no longer necessary to observe a Jubilee to free such slaves. The “Urim and Thummim” were also done away with, although the High Priest retained all of the other vestments.",
                "The Great Synagogue also appointed judges in all places where Jews resided so that everyone could find justice according to the laws of the Torah. They determined the content of “Tefillin” and “Mezuzoth” on the door posts and tightened all prohibitions, even forbidding many things which were previously permitted. This was done to prevent laxity in the observance of all prohibitions. The commandment of the Torah “an eye for an eye” they interpreted to mean that monetary compensation should be granted to the victim for the damage caused him instead of the literal meaning which is implied in Leviticus 24, 2.",
                "The necessity for preserving the oral law from getting lost was especially keenly felt about the interpretations of the commandments. When sacrifices were done away with and prayers took their place it was necessary to codify the laws pertaining to prayers as well as to elucidate those laws which were not clearly explained in the Torah. In addition there was the constant change in the concepts of the people going on over a period of seven centuries. When the Jews returned to Palestine from the Babylonian exile they were primarily tillers of the soil and shepherds. Later there arose a class of wage workers, merchants and artisans. This necessitated new interpretations of the laws to conform with the development of the times.",
                "Out of all these interpretations there developed a wide literature whose content is the pride of the Jewish nation. This includes sixty tractates of the Talmud in two different texts and in addition Tosephta, Safra, Sifri, Mechilta together with hundreds of various Midrashim.",
                "This whole literature is divided into Halacha and Hagadah. The Halacha includes the injunctions of the law. The Hagadah, on the other hand, introduces a living spirit into the dry legal commandments; it enriches the law with poetic softness and lends to it characteristic beauty. The “Halacha” teaches how to observe the Sabbath and the feast days, how to make a Succah, what four kinds of plants are to be used on Succoth. The “Hagadah” explains the spiritual value of the Sabbath as well as the significance of the other feast days and their attendant customs. Both the Halacha and the Hagadah are basic foundations of the oral law and are of equal worth to the development of Judaism.",
                "Concerning the Hagadah it is also worth remarking that it is of special significance for another reason. It deals continually with the concepts of justice even as it is concerned with the attributes of godliness. It relates many historical events, it cites scientific and medical knowledge as well as proverbs and axiomatic truths of life which accumulated among the Jews in the course of those seven centuries.",
                "In the Halacha we find those religious injunctions which a Jew must follow as well as the code of just relationships between man and man. These two types of law the Talmud refers to as prohibitions and laws. The expounders of these two types of law are divided into two classes. One carries greater authority in religious matters and the other in matters pertaining to human relationship.",
                "The scholars endeavored to define the boundaries of the “fence around the Torah” which the members of the Great Synagogue ordered to be erected in so far as this pertained to the religious regulations. But some of these limitations were considered too extreme by the later scholars and the Tanaim who created the Mishna ruled that “whoever attempts to interpret a law more severely than is accepted must prove his source of authority.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ידים, פרק ד׳ משנה ג׳.</span></i> Afterward it was said that “anyone who attempts to abide by the restrictions of the school of Shamai and the school of Hillel is like a foolish man who walks in the darkness”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין ו׳ ב׳.</span></i> and Rabbi Chya warned against attaching more importance to the “fence around the Torah” than to the essence of the Torah itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בראשית רבה י״ט ד׳.</span></i>",
                "It was for this reason that the scholars objected to having the people assume obligations to perform deeds which the law did not impose upon them and they said that whoever does something which is not made obligatory by law may be called a simpleton.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי שבת פרק א׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> One of the Amoraim expressed this attitude in the following words: “Are there not enough prohibitions in the Torah already that one should seek to establish still other prohibitions?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי שבת פרק ז׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> and although some of the scholars were strict in the enforcement of certain rabbinical commandments, even stricter than in their interpretations of the commandments of the Torah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ד׳ ב׳; סנהדרין פ״ח ב׳.</span></i> the general tendency was nevertheless to lighten the burden of the observance of the laws.",
                "This “fence around the Torah,” which the scholars erected, was very timely because the masses of the people were not acquainted with the precepts of the law. From these preventive measures there later developed numerous and various laws as, for instance, the restrictions pertaining to regulations concerning marriage, of which it was said that they are like a garden watchman—if a man watches his garden from the outside he protects it completely.",
                "Very much concerned for the sanctity of morals and the purity of people’s lives, the scholars ruled that a man might not remain alone with a strange woman in an unfrequented place. However, there are indications that this prohibition is derived from a much earlier period.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">קדושין פּ׳ ב׳.</span></i> In addition to the prohibitions of adultery which are listed in the Torah (Leviticus, 18), the scholars also prohibited marriage between twenty-six different degrees of relatives.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יבמות כ״א א׳; ירושלמי יבמות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>",
                "Since the Sabbath was not properly observed in previous generations until the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, the people were warned to observe this day and to sanctify it by means of the restriction of its regulations in order to avoid false interpretations as to what may be done on that day and to prevent people from performing work which is not allowed. At this time the exact meaning of the word <span dir=\"rtl\">מלאכה</span> (work) was defined in order that everyone should know what work is permissible on the Sabbath. The scholars enumerated 39 major types of work which are forbidden on the Sabbath and the performance of which is punishable by death or by flogging. Among these are the following: sowing, plowing, reaping, hauling grain from the field, threshing, baking and cooking, lighting or putting out a fire, hunting, slaughtering, cultivating fields, writing and erasing, building and wrecking, sewing and tearing, carrying objects from a house to the street and vice versa.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת ע״ג א׳.</span></i>",
                "In addition to these occupations they forbade many other activities, which do not properly speaking constitute work, but which introduce a week day atmosphere such as, climbing a tree, riding on an animal, swimming, judging, buying and selling, getting married and similar pursuits. All of these activities may not be performed on the Sabbath in order to insure complete rest and are also forbidden on feast days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ביצה ל״ו ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Out of concern for the sanctity of the Sabbath, the scholars prohibited the carrying into the street of such objects as are used in the performance of week day labor. In order to safeguard the Sabbath they ruled that it is to be observed from sunset on Friday till the stars appear on Saturday. At the same time they introduced the custom of pronouncing the Kiddush (sanctification) and Havdalah (separation) over a glass of wine at the beginning and at the departure of the Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ל״ג א׳.</span></i>",
                "There also was appointed a man who was to give the signal with a Shofar (ram’s horn) for everyone to stop working. The first blowing of the shofar was a signal to the laborers in the fields to cease working; the second blast of the shofar was a signal to the merchants and artisans in the city to put away their work; the third blast was signal to stop all work in one’s house. The shofar was blown once more as a sign that the Sabbath has begun.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת ל״ה ב׳; שבת קי״ד א׳; סוכה נ״ז ב׳; חולין כ״ו ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Particular effort was exerted by the scholars to remove the disabilities and difficulties which surrounded deserted wives. This need was very keenly felt at that time due to the fact that many men had to leave their homes in search of a livelihood. The highways were then unsafe and many of these men lost their lives or were captured and sold as slaves after which they were never heard of again and the status of their wives remained indefinite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין ג׳ א׳; י״ט ב׳.</span></i> Similarly an attempt was made to facilitate the procedure of buying land in Palestine from non Jews. It was ruled that such a bill of sale might be drawn up even on the Sabbath. In the Talmud we find a query in this matter: “How can one write such a contract on Saturday? How would that be possible?” The answer given to this question was that it is permissible to have such a contract drawn up on the Sabbath by a non-Jew, while other activities may not be performed on the Sabbath even through the agency of a non-Jew.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין ח׳ ב׳.</span></i>",
                "It was also accepted as a rule that just as it is forbidden to declare the impure to be pure even so is forbidden to declare the pure to be impure.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15a)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">15א) ירושלמי סוטה פרק ח׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Nehunia b. Hakana therefore constantly prayed to be preserved from declaring the pure to be impure, and the impure to be pure<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות כ״ח ב׳.</span></i> and whenever the scholars prohibited certain actions to be performed or pleasures to be enjoyed, they carefully determined beforehand whether the people could abide by these restrictions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא בתרא ס׳ ב׳; עבודה זרה ל׳ א׳.</span></i> It is therefore interesting to note that they applied the rule of the “greater power of leniency” only in religious questions. Only in such questions did the school of Hillel decide in favor of leniency and the law remained according to the decisions of the school of Hillel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין י״ג ב׳.</span></i>",
                "But their attitude was different whenever the law involved relations between people. In such a case our scholars studied the problem in all its implications and always considered it on its own merits in an attempt to avoid the severity of the rule which claimed that “the law must penetrate mountains.” They believed that Jerusalem was destroyed because its people insisted on enforcing the letter of the law and did not practice mercy outside of the law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא מציעא ל׳ ב.</span></i>",
                "The scholars therefore maintained that the aim of the Torah was not to impose stringent legislation but to encourage the practice of kindness among people. They said that whenever a man aids his neighbor with money or by means of other good deeds but he does so only out of a feeling of duty then such deeds are not acceptable to God because they lack love and generosity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סוכה מ״ט ב׳.</span></i> Similarly they believed that even the study of the Torah is worthless when it is not accompanied by kindness to other people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יבמות ק״ט ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Harmony between husband and wife they held to be the very foundation of family life and they said: “Whoever loves his wife even as he loves himself and respects her more than he respects himself and leads his children in the proper ways and loves his neighbors and welcomes his relatives, such a man fulfills the wishes of God.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יבמות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> The scholars also instructed that man should not be partial in his love for his children and should show no favoritism in the division of the inheritance even in order to compensate a good son at the expense of a wicked one.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא בתרא קל״ג ב׳.</span></i>",
                "As an example of the fear of God the scholars extolled Job and they cited Abraham as an example of the love of God. Both of these were ready to overlook their own comfort and dignity in order to be of use to others. Therefore a man must permit himself to be insulted rather than to insult others; if a man is slandered he should not reply in kind; he must fulfill the commandments out of love and he should rejoice in his suffering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא כ״ג א׳</span></i> Similarly a man must permit himself to be persecuted without persecuting others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא קמא צ״ג א׳.</span></i>",
                "In addition to the above virtues the Talmud defined the ideal person as a scholar, “Talmid Chochom,” who strives only for the Torah and whose innermost wish is to attain a high degree of morality in his relations with God and man. But who is to be considered a “Talmid Chochom”? The Talmud says that a “Talmid Chochom” is a person who can answer a question of law whenever he is asked. Others maintain that a “Talmid Chochom” is one who disregards his own interests and devotes himself to godly matters solely.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת קי״ד ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Such “Talmide Chachomim” (scholars) must always endeavor to set an example for others with their behavior as well as by their exterior appearance. A scholar must not allow his clothes to be spotted and must keep himself as attractive as a girl.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">איכה רבתי א׳ ד׳.</span></i> He must also maintain better manners than others while eating, sitting down, standing up and walking about the street.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">דרך ארץ זוטא פרק ד׳—ה׳.</span></i>",
                "Various commandments of the Torah were observed by Jews even before the Torah was handed down. After they received the Torah it was only necessary to define and to strengthen these long since accepted commandments. When the Talmud states that Abraham observed all the commandments including “Eruv Tavshilin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> it expresses a profound idea that most of the laws which the scholars read into the Torah were operative among Jews for a long time preceding the giving of the Torah.",
                "It is not necessary here to describe what “Tefillin” (phylacteries) are. But it is interesting to note that the Mishna makes no mention of the laws pertaining to phylacteries, nor of their appearance and how they should be made. Likewise it makes no mention of the benedictions that have to be pronounced over the phylacteries. It is therefore safe to assume that all of these laws were well known during the time that the Mishna was created. But later scholars feared that the laws and customs pertaining to phylacteries might be forgotten and they therefore had them written down.",
                "The phylacteries contain four passages of the Bible which refer to the deliverance from Egypt and mention is also made of the injunction that “these words shall be a sign upon your arm and a decoration between the eyes.” For the concept of decoration the text employs the Hebrew word “Totefeth.” The scholars tried to explain this word to prove that phylacteries must contain four passages. Using the fact that the word “Totafoth,” which appears three times, is written once in abbreviated form without the letter “vav” and twice with the letters “vav” they tried to conclude from this that all four passages must be included in the phylacteries. At a later date Rabbi Akiba, who always forced the texts to prove his contentions, tried to deduce the same conclusion in a different manner. He explained the word “Totefeth” to mean four on the basis of two ancient tongues.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין ד׳ ב׳; זבחים ל״ז ב׳; מנחות ל״ד ב׳.</span></i>",
                "The word “Totefeth” is also mentioned once in the Mishnah and is meant to be a forehead piece. Interpreters declare it to be a decoration worn instead of phylacteries. In the Talmud the word “Totefeth” is used once and is synonymous with phylacteries.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא ל״ג ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Long before the Torah was handed down it was the accepted custom among all nations that priests, as well as all other people who deal with religious matters, should wear religious emblems to distinguish them as men who are devoted to godly service. In later years, this custom of distinguishing between people according to their office, was also transferred to social and political life. Leaders of the army and officials thus carried special insignia to mark them as servants of the government. In a similar manner Jews adopted phylacteries to symbolize that their bearers are in the service of God.",
                "It is therefore essential to know that even though the commandment to wear phylacteries is not expressly stated in the Torah and is only sanctioned by tradition and despite the fact that it is possible to interpret the word “Totefeth” differently, there is nevertheless not the slightest doubt that the law of wearing phylacteries was in effect among Jews at all times. As additional proof of this we may adduce the fact told by R. Azariah of the Adomim that when Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, sent messengers to Jerusalem to learn about the Jewish religion, the high priest Eleazar explained to them the custom of wearing phylacteries.",
                "There is a dispute in the Talmud whether phylacteries should be worn on Saturday. Rabbi Akiba is of the opinion that since phylacteries are worn as a reminder of the deliverance from Egypt it is not necessary to wear them on those days which serve, in themselves, as reminders of this event such as the Sabbath and the feast days. The question as to whether they should be worn at night he answers in the affirmative.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין צ״ו א׳.</span></i>",
                "Women, slaves and children are not obliged to wear phylacteries.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות כ׳ ב׳.</span></i> The Talmud derives this conclusion from the well known rule that women are exempt from all those positive commandments which depend on a definite time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">קדושין כ״ט א׳.</span></i> It is characteristic that on another occasion the Talmud questions the authority of this rule and finds substantiation for it in the law of phylacteries. “Since phylacteries are obligatory only during a definite time and women are exempt from this commandment, it follows that women are exempt from any commandment which is obligatory only during a definite time.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">קדושין ל״ד א׳.</span></i> This logical conclusion regarding the exemption of women from the law of phylacteries thus proceeds in two directions. On the one hand it liberates women from this law and then it proceeds to liberate them from all laws which have the common time characteristic with it.",
                "Phylacteries, as was explained before, are an emblem which indicates that those who wear them are devoted to God solely and do not recognize any other authority. But women, according to the concepts of that time, were the property of their husbands and a married woman was as obedient as a slave and was not the mistress of her actions. For this reason women could not wear phylacteries. It is told, however, that Michal the daughter of Kushi, (in the opinion of some she is identified with Michal the daughter of Saul) did wear phylacteries.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין צ״ו א׳.</span></i> This conclusion is derived from the fact that Michal the daughter of Saul once spoke sharply to king David. (Samuel II, Ch. 6.) There is also the case of one other woman, whose name remains unknown, who wrote the phylacteries for her husband.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בכורות ל׳ ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Slaves were considered in the same category as women in the matter of phylacteries. Since “Tefillin” contain the statement that God is the only lord of the world, it was impossible for a person who recognized the overlordship of a human being to wear them. Mention is made, however, of one Tabai, a slave of Rabbi Gamaliel, who wore phylacteries.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מכילתא פ׳ בא.</span></i>",
                "The opinions of the scholars regarding God were highly original when compared to the prevailing concepts of that time. These opinions differed from those of the nations among whom the Jews lived. Greek culture had attained a high level of perfection but the Greeks still clung to polytheism. The same was true of the Romans, the Parthians and the Persians. In later years the Christians tried to prove that the trinity was a direct continuation of the Jewish faith. One is therefore astounded when he realizes the fortitude of our scholars and their success in their struggle against attempts to introduce competing deities.",
                "The representation of God in a corporeal form, such as the sayings: the hand of God, the mouth of God, the foot of God, the back of God, the scholars explained by the need to describe Him in a manner that should be understandable according to human concepts. At the same time they expressly stated that under no circumstance must these concepts be understood literally that God possesses a hand, a foot or a mouth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מכילתא פ׳ יתרו.</span></i>",
                "The scholars then began to refer to God with names whose aim was to elevate the idea of God above human concepts. They referred to Him with the word “Shechinah” which means that grace which emanates from the godly majesty. At times they called Him “Gevurah,” in an attempt to convey the idea that he represents strength. Similarly they used the name “Makom” (place) because he is present everywhere, and “Shomaim” (Heaven) after the name of his residence. It is also characteristic that these names were not invented by the scholars but were current long before that.",
                "The creation of the world they explained as creation ex nihilo. The central aim of creation was man, who was made in the image of God, whose face turns heavenward and who stands upright on his feet. Man possesses a soul and a free will to do as he chooses. Speaking of man, they considered the Jews to be the chosen people; within the Jewish people the pious and righteous man was the one elect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>",
                "The idea of God’s unity, our scholars held to be of the highest importance.

                "When studying the Torah one must aim to observe its commandments. Observation of the commandments is also conditioned by faith in Him who gave the commandments. The Jew was also enjoined to do all things for the sake of God and not merely out of feeling of duty or because he was persuaded that these things must be done.",
                "Faith imposes the obligation to accept the authority of the “kingdom of heaven” and it includes the duty of thanking God on all occasions for the favors as well as for the hardships; one must also submit to the guidance of God and believe that whatever He does is ultimately for the best. It is necessary to serve Him out of love and to endeavor to make others love him. In doing so man’s behavior will become akin to that of God; even as God practices compassion and mercy so also must man strive to attain these virtues.",
                "Before the reciting of prayers was introduced it was customary to offer sacrifices.

                "Most important of all is charity which one contributes with his money or by means of personal effort on behalf of another person. Charity is founded in love of one person for another which Hillel expressed as a rule of the Torah: “Do not unto others what you would not have done unto yourself.”",
                "When observing this rule one is led to the practice of true justice, mercy and compassion toward all living things including animals.",
                "Another desirable trait is to preach moral truths to others.

                "One must also believe that God sees all the actions of man, that He knows the needs of the whole world and helps everyone; He particularly aids the Jews because of their justice and their faith in his mercy.",
                "God’s messengers are the angels, the prophets and the just men.

                "But the most beautiful element of the faith is the belief in compensation and punishment. After his death, man is compensated for his good deeds and punished for his evil doing; children of good parents are credited with the deeds of their forefathers. And even as the individual meets with justice after death so also does the group. For the nation this assumes the form of the coming of Messiah and the coming to life of the dead. Of these matters the scholars spoke briefly when they referred to the “wars of Gog and Magog,” the “pains of Messiah,” the return of the “kingdom of David,” the “future that is to come” and others. All of these were to compensate the nation for the suffering which it has to endure in the present.",

            "The Three Main Parties of the Talmudic Period; The Pharisees, The Sadducees, The Essenes": [
                "F<small>OLLOWING</small> closely upon the victory of the Hasmoneans over the Greek armies and their Jewish proteges, there began a dispute over the interpretation of the commandments of the Pentateuch concerning which many of the scholars held varying opinions. These disputes were frequently so serious that they constituted a threat to the existence of the nation.",
                "Out of these disputes there emerged three main tendencies which eventually crystallized into three different parties: the Pharisees, the Saducees and the Essenes.",
                "In general it is impossible to grasp the spirit of the Talmud and to understand clearly the teachings of its authors if one does not previously acquaint himself with the tendencies of these parties. It is also necessary to know that nearly all of the authors of the Talmud were Pharisees and that their spirit impressed its stamp on the Talmud, although it also contains numerous aphorisms by people who frequently joked at the expense of the Pharisees.",
                "It is worth noting that the Pharisees were active in establishing regulations over the conduct of Judaism that would serve as a defensive wall about the Torah. To this end many laws of the Torah were made more severe and others assumed a form which to the casual observer seemed to deviate from the original text. These interpretations were generally based on traditions which in turn had to be substantiated by the Torah. These different opinions were sharply disputed until the people were divided into the above mentioned three parties which afterward attacked each other.",
                "Many of the Pharisees practiced such extreme piety that they renounced all earthly pleasures and by their actions and customs they set themselves apart from the rest of the population. On the other hand, there were many people who refused to recognize any interpretation of the law which, to them, seemed to be in disagreement with its literal meaning. These people particularly objected to the restrictions of the “oral law”. They allied themselves with those who fought against the laws that were based on tradition. The opponents of the Pharisees argued that the devotion of the Pharisees to the interpretations goes to such extremes of unreasoning belief that were their leaders to tell them that right is left and vice versa, they would unquestioningly obey the advice of their teachers.",
                "The opponents of the Pharisees numbered in their midst the rich and politically influential Jews who felt that their attempts to attain closer spiritual relations with the neighboring peoples were hindered by the activities of the Pharisees. They particularly opposed the Pharisees because of the latter’s devotion to faith and because of their lack of concern for the other problems of life. The Pharisees, on the other hand, held these views because of their conviction that man can achieve nothing without God’s consent and that every attempt which runs counter to God’s will is doomed to fail.",
                "Separated from all other people by their manner of observing the Jewish customs, the Pharisees considered the other Jews as idol worshippers with whom no pious man should have any contact. Their very name indicated that they were a class apart in their behavior. (The Hebrew word <span dir=\"rtl\">פּרושים</span> means people separated or isolated.) They were especially severe in their observance of the laws pertaining to cleanliness and the paying of the tithe to the Priests and Levites. They believed that forbidden foods as well as grains from which no tithe was given to the priests were impure. The Pharisees were also careful to observe all the dietary rules of cleanliness even when they ate ordinary food and not that of sacrifices.",
                "As a pious precaution, many Pharisees abstained from dealing with the so-called “Ame Aratzim” (people of the soil). A Pharisee would not eat at the same table with an “Am Ha’Aretz” out of suspicion that the latter may not have contributed his share to the Priests and Levites. Neither would a Pharisee buy from or sell to an “Am Ha’Aretz”, nor invite one to his house, nor go visiting into the house of an “Am Ha’Aretz”.",
                "The name “Am Ha’Aretz” was at that time applied primarily to tillers of the soil. Although agricultural work, as such, was highly regarded by the scholars, many of them openly confessed their dislike for the “Am Ha’Aretz”, the man of the soil. Certain historians try to interpret this attitude as an indication that the tillers of the soil were not racially pure and freely inter-married with their gentile neighbors. In the Talmud there are widely diverging opinions as to which people should be classified as “Am Ha’Aretz”. Some would have it that an “Am Ha’Aretz” is a person who does not contribute the tithe from the fruit of his land. Rabbi Eliezer held that an “Am Ha’Aretz” is one who does not recite the prayer “Shema” morning and evening. Rabbi Joshua said an “Am Ha’Aretz” is one who does not wear Phylacteries. Ben Azai said it is one who does not wear fringes. Rabbi Nathan said it is one who has no Mezuzah on his door; Rabbi Nathan, the son of Joseph, said it is one who does not raise his children in the knowledge of the Torah. Others contended that even if a person studied much himself but did not serve other scholars, he deserves to be called an “Am Ha’Aretz.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות מ״ז ב׳.</span></i>",
                "The Pharisees disdained an “Am Ha’Aretz”. From other sources in the Talmud we know that the “Am Ha’Aretz” hated scholars.",
                "Concerning the meaning of the word “Pharisees” it was noted above that it indicates people who separated themselves from all others by their behavior. Others would have it that the name derives from the fact that they devoted themselves to interpreting the law as they saw fit in order to adapt the religious commandments to the needs of the times. Since the Pharisees deeply understood the spirit of the Torah, they gave up the search for pleasure in life even as they avoided pride or any action which might seem immoral. They practiced brotherly love toward one another and each individual sought with all his might to avoid temptation.",
                "The Pharisees were organized as a society and every member was addressed as “Friend”. This was not a closed organization and it did not limit its membership. Any person could join if he promised, in the presence of three members, to observe the rules of the organization which concentrated on cleanliness and ablutions. It is interesting to note that in accepting a new member no distinction was made between a scholar and an uneducated person. Both were considered of equal worth and any person who was willing to assume the burdens of Pharisaism could join the society.",
                "As soon as a person became a member of the Pharisee society he undertook to serve God with his whole life. Such a person had to believe that God’s eye is all-seeing and that He observes all man’s acts in order to judge them for every injustice. Since man possesses a free will to do as he chooses he is held responsible for every act and he will have to account for his deeds before his Creator. The Pharisees also believed that God sometimes issues decrees governing nations or all of humanity and that such decrees may seem unreasonable to the victims. But such decrees are certainly just since God is just to the individual as well as to a group. If it appears that reward for good deeds or punishment for wrong doing is delayed, then one must remember that there is a reckoning after death, or later yet, when the dead will be resurrected, the deserving ones to eternal life and the evil ones to everlasting shame and suffering.",
                "The Pharisees were very careful in their judgment of people and events. This is clearly seen from their verdicts involving physical punishment. They also treated everyone modestly; they received people kindly and tried to do good deeds to others, in so far as they could, at times even going beyond the limits of their strength. They were, therefore, deeply loved by the people and enjoyed their fullest confidence.",
                "But what frequently happens to many high minded people also happened to the Pharisees. In spite of their good qualities, many people doubted the purity of their motives and they were suspected of doing many things in order to deceive their neighbors.",
                "A specially strong hatred toward the Pharisees is evidenced by the New Testament. As a result of this the term “Pharisee” is today employed in world literature as a derogatory term and has become synonymous with a hypocrite. In other Christian writings the Pharisees are pictured as people who outwardly abstain from earthly pleasures but lead immoral lives. They are said to refuse to eat honey from impure bees, but do not abstain from pork. They are accused of fasting in order to atone for their sins against God even while they plan to deceive their neighbors.",
                "It is probably true that among such a large group as the Pharisees were there must have been a number of individuals who were dishonest in their convictions. But it is also certain that the majority was honest, or they could not have maintained the leadership of the nation in those times.",
                "It was remarked above that some of the scholars ridiculed the Pharisees. They portrayed seven different types, none of which was presented in a favorable light. The seven types are as follows: 1) One who is pious as Shechem, the son of Chamor, who was circumcised in order to obtain Dinah. 2) One who goes about with bowed head and hardly dares to raise his feet off the ground in order to display his modesty. 3) One who beats his head against a wall or goes about with closed eyes so as not to look at women. 4) One who goes about with twisted neck and head bowed like a hammer. 5) One who would persuade people that he has already done everything and challenges them to point out something he has not done yet. 6) One who does good deeds out of love for the reward which they bring. 7) One who obeys the law out of fear of the punishment which disobedience will bring.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סוטה ב״ב ב׳.</span></i>",

It is believed that the principles which were accepted among the Sadducees originated in the misconceptions of Zadok and Boetus (pupils of Antigonos of Socho). Other historians hold a different opinion. Those claim that the Sadducees were descendants or disciples of the Zadok family which was a part of the priestly aristocracy and produced numerous high priests in the course of several centuries. When, in later years, the Hasmoneans triumphed over the Greeks, they also took over the high priests’ office. Thus ousted from power, the descendants of Zadok were forced into a status of opposition to the majority of Jewish leadership.",
                "The first source of friction between the Sadducees and Pharisees was thus purely political and only at a later date did it develop into an acute religious dispute. There is also no cause to doubt the Talmudic tradition that the Sadducees were the followers of Zadok and Boetus and at the same time to accept the theory of the historians that they were the descendants of the house of Zadok who allied themselves with these followers in undermining the foundations of Jewish traditions.",
                "But it would be incorrect to maintain that the Sadducees completely rejected the traditional interpretations of the law. They too held to numerous traditions and many of their interpretations of the religious law were substantially the same as those of the Pharisees. They had their own “Book of Decrees” (<span dir=\"rtl\">ספר הגזרות</span>) which expounded their explanations of the commandments of the Torah and, in spite of their desire to resemble the other nations in behavior, they also observed some customs which tended to set them apart from the Gentiles.",
                "The customs of the Sadducees, at any rate, were better adapted to the religious beliefs of the rich and the aristocracy which governed the land. But the greater the number of rich men who joined the Sadducees, the stronger became the concentration of the masses about the Pharisees and the abyss between the two grew from day to day.",
                "The primary difference between the Sadducees and the Pharisees consisted in that the Sadducees rejected the oral law which was accepted by the Pharisees. They maintained that only the written law of the Torah was binding upon men. In rejecting the traditions of the Pharisees, they refused to believe in the resurrection of the dead, which is not explicitly promised in the Torah. They ridiculed the Pharisees for the latter’s belief in the immortality of the soul and in a life after death and made fun of the notion that the souls of the pious will rest under the throne of glory. Another subject of their humor was the Pharisees’ readiness to endure suffering in the hope of being rewarded in life to come.",
                "The development of this party proceeded favorably because of the response which its ideas found among aristocratic and government circles which usually had the power to suppress opposition by force. There is also much justification for the view that the party of the Sadducees prospered due to the discomfiture of the Hellenists after the triumph of the Maccabees.",
                "A major source of difference was the Pharisees’ belief that even though a man may possess a free will to do either good or evil, according to his inclination, nevertheless God controls him in everything and is the ruler of his thoughts. The Sadducees maintained that God does not interfere with man’s behavior and that no reward or punishment awaits one after death. Reward or punishment, they argued, are inherent in the deed itself.",
                "Twelve points involving disputed interpretation of ritual and law were contested by the Sadducees who claimed that: 1) The date of the Feast of Weeks should always fall upon a Sunday. 2) The daily sacrifice is to be provided by the individual and not by the community. 3) Frankincense burned on the Day of Atonement should be kindled by the High Priest before entering the Holy of Holies. 4) The ashes of the Red Heifer sacrifice should be gathered by a man who underwent purification the same day according to Numbers 19, 9. 5) The Sadducees burned only a small share of their meal offerings and ate the rest. 6) The commandment “an eye for an eye” they interpreted literally, so that if one crippled another, he himself should be crippled in like manner. 7) In the case of a false witness whose evidence causes the defendant to be punished, the false witness was to receive the same punishment. If the judgment brought about a death sentence, the false witness was not to receive his punishment until after the defendant was executed. 8) The law that only male offspring were to share the inheritance of their father was interpreted to mean that, if the heir was an only son and he died leaving only daughters, then his sisters as well as his daughters shared the inheritance. 9) The Sadducees held that a man was responsible for damage done by his slave just as he was liable for damage done by his live stock since the slave, possessing intelligence, might have caused the damage on orders of his owner. 10) They held a utensil to be unclean if from it a liquid was poured into an unclean utensil, thus making the liquid unclean. 11) They literally adhered to the procedure prescribed for a childless widow whose dead husband’s brother refused to marry her, helding it necessary that she spit in his face while the Pharisees held that she only need spit on the ground before him. 12) They also held to the literal meaning of the injunction in Deut. 22, 17, regarding disputed virginity, while the Pharisees gave it a broader interpretation.",
                "There were also six traditional customs, which had no sanction in the Pentateuch, which the Pharisees observed and the Sadducees rejected: 1) The pouring of water on the altar on the night following the first day of Succoth. All night water was drawn from the river Shiloah to the accompaniment of music and singing and was poured on the altar. The Sadducees ridiculed this custom as of Greek origin, but the Pharisees were devoted to it. Once, when a Sadducee priest poured the water on his feet instead of the altar, the angered populace showered him with their ethrogim and killed him. 2) The procession round the altar with willow branches was rejected by the Sadducees. When the seventh day of the Feast of Tabernacles occurred on Saturday, as was then possible due to the inaccuracies of the calendar, the Sadducees held that the custom of beating the willow branches did not supersede the Sabbath, contrary to the custom of the Pharisees. 3) They were opposed to the Phariseical custom of washing the hands after reading the Bible. 4) They opposed the inclusion of the phrase “according to the law of Moses and Israel” into the divorce certificates. Since these certificates bore the name and the year of the reign of the king, the Sadducees thought it would show disrespect for Moses to have his name appear alongside that of the king. 5) They denied the validity of Nehemiah’s injunction against carrying objects from one household to another on the Sabbath. 6) They refused to recognize the new restrictions with which the Pharisees embellished the laws pertaining to purification of women.",
                "But in spite of the oposition of the Sadducees to the teachings of the Pharisees and in spite of their having the support of the rich and the officials, they were not strong enough to withstand the pressure of the population which was mostly on the side of the Pharisees and was ready to defend its convictions with its very life.",
                "Many customs were introduced by the Pharisees purely out of spite for the Sadducees. They endeavored to impress the people that under no circumstances must they act according to the dictates of the Sadducees even when these were nearly accurate. The Pharisees established the date of the Feast of Weeks on the sixth day of Sivan which, according to their calculations, was the date of the giving of the Torah. In the prayers to be recited on that day they included the words “the time our Torah was given” in order to strengthen the conviction that this feast was celebrated in commemoration of the giving of the Torah and not as a celebration of the bringing of the first fruits.",

From the Sadducees in later times evolved the sect of the Karaites who represent the same mode of thinking. Of the Essenes we can only say that the early Christians conducted themselves along similar lines.",
                "The development of the Essenes began in the early years of the Hasmoneans, and they are derived from the “Chassidim” of that time who fought against the Syrian Greeks under the banner of Judah Macabee and his brothers. They were those who would rather undergo martyrdom than do anything which might make them suspect of imitating the Greeks. However, many of them became dissatisfied with the situation even as it existed after the victory of the Maccabees. To them the behavior of the Hasmoneans was not sufficiently Jewish. They fled the cities and sought refuge in the mountains where they lived in an unusual manner apart from everyone else and awaited a change in the direction of Jewish ideas.",
                "The meaning of the name Essenes is not entirely clear. Josephus called them Essenes; in Hebrew they are referred to as <span dir=\"rtl\">״אסיים״</span>. Some historians claim it means modest, others say it means shy. Another version interprets the name as “healers” because the Essenes devoted themselves to healing the sick. The Talmud refers to them as “morning baptists” due to their habit of performing long morning ablutions. They were sometimes called pious fools and the Talmud defines a pious fool as a person who would not rescue a drowning woman for fear of touching her.",
                "The conduct of the Essenes was not always the same and in the course of time it changed although the basic principles remained constant. Their main idea was to avoid impurity of the body because of their belief that an impure body harbors an impure soul. Because of this fear of an impure soul the Essenes refused to marry. They considered woman as the source of immorality and discord. However, they later realized that by not marrying their society constantly diminishes and some of their members decided to marry in order to bring children into the world. The rest stubbornly clung to the original principle and remained unmarried till their death.",
                "The Essenes did not follow any employment at first since they believed that all work soils the body. When they suffered a shortage of food because no outsider would provide for their needs, they refused to steal and since there were not enough fruit trees and wild grasses to subsist on, they decided that work is permissible and they engaged in agriculture.",
                "Some customs of the Essenes remained unchanged. When a person was sworn into their society he had to promise never to take an oath again, even if it was to tell the truth and his very life depended on taking the oath. They also believed that by means of their special customs they could become imbued with the holy spirit and be able to foresee the future. They had their special books which they successfully guarded from the eyes of strangers even as they avoided coming in contact with people holding other beliefs. Some of them devoted themselves to healing the sick with various grasses and herbs; others did their healing with the aid of incantations and prayers to the angels in charge of cures whose names they knew. Instead of bringing sacrifices, the Essenes offered prayers which generally began with praise to the Creator of light who “daily repeats the miracles of Genesis.”",
                "The Essenes never consumed food or drink which was not absolutely essential for the maintenance of life. They ate no meat and drank no wine and did not seek any pleasure in life. On the contrary, they hardened their bodies and gloried in suffering. Slavery they considered shameful because all men are brothers and as long as a man can serve himself he has no right to allow himself to be served by others. Every member of their society received what he needed free. They avoided anger and their word was sacred. They respected each other and even refrained from spitting in the presence of another person.",
                "There were neither poor nor rich among the Essenes, for every person who joined them had to give all of his possessions to the society. Young and old, they all wore similar linen clothing which they guarded, just as carefully as they guarded their bodies, against dirt and the slightest spot, for they held cleanliness to be a decoration for a human being. Nevertheless they did not don any new garment as long as the old one could still be used.",
                "They observed all the minutest regulations pertaining to Sabbath until it practically became a fast day for them. Since cooking was prohibited they ate nothing but dry bread, neither would they take any object into their hands and none of them even rose from their places on this day.",
                "Many customs which the Pharisee scholars introduced into Jewish life were meant to be a protest against the Essenes. Since the Essenes did not eat meat nor drink wine and narrowly circumscribed their actions on the Sabbath, the Pharisee scholars expressly commanded that people should joyfully celebrate the Sabbath with meat and wine. Thus they also permitted the carrying of certain objects from one place to another (within the same household). When the Essenes became more strict and prohibited the lifting up of any object on the Sabbath, the scholars relented and permitted the touching of any vessel which is a bodily necessity or convenience, with the exception of tools which are used in every day labor. When the Essenes refused to marry, the Pharisees declared that any person who does not marry can be compared to a murderer who diminishes the stature of the Jewish people and drives the spirit of God out of its confines. Since the Essenes healed the sick with incantations, the Pharisees announced that whoever would attempt to perform a cure by means of an incantation would lose his share in life to come.",
                "The Essenes customarily rose before dawn and bathed in cold water both summer and winter. They then put on newly washed clothes and, without anyone uttering a word, they began their collective praise to the Creator. When the sun rose each one went to his work which lasted five hours. After that they gathered again, removed their work clothes and bathed anew; they put on different clothes and entered their meeting house where no outsider was allowed. There they ate their bread and greens, each one maintaining silence, convinced that they were performing a necessary act in sustaining the body which God gave them and which must therefore be guarded. After the meal the oldest gave praise to God for His great mercy. They then removed the clothes which they donned when eating, put on their work garments and returned to work till nightfall. With sunset the previous procedure was repeated; they bathed and again changed clothes for the evening repast.",
                "When a newcomer desired to join the Essenes, he was not so readily accepted. The candidate was put on probation for a year to test his self-control and his ability to observe all the regulations of the society. Then he was given a white shirt, cloak and a small ax and was put to work together with the rest. When, at the end of the year, the person proved that his conduct was consistent he was allowed to perform his ablutions together with the others. However, he still was not permitted to partake of food with the rest for an additional two years. Only if he was found worthy, at the end of that time, to join the society, was he allowed to eat with the rest and the secrets of the society were confided to him. Before the candidate had his first meal together with the other members he had to take an oath that he would love and fear God above all else and with his whole soul, that he would love other people more than himself, and that he would be kind to all creatures. He had to promise not to deceive anyone even if the greatest fortune were at stake; he promised to help the oppressed, not to be haughty toward other people, to love truth and hate falsehood with his whole heart, and above all, to divulge none of the secrets of the society to any person.",
                "Only after he was thus sworn in did the candidate become a full-fledged member of the Essene society to whom all secrets were entrusted with the assurance that he would not desecrate his oath and reveal them to others."

            "The Samaritans": [
                "I<small>N DESCRIBING</small> the events in the lives of the authors of the Talmud, we will have numerous occasions to refer to the Samaritans and their various attitudes to political development in Palestine. We will therefore pause to explain who these people were.",
                "It is stated on historical grounds that the Samaritans are a mixture of a small remnant of the Ten Tribes whose kingdom in Samaria was destroyed by King Sargon of Assyria (722 B. C.). This king exiled over 27 thousand inhabitants of the Samarian population to Habor, the river Gozan, Halach and the cities of Media and in their place he settled people from Babylonia, Kutha, Ava, Hamath and Sfarvaim. The remaining people of the Ten Tribes mixed with the newly settled peoples and as a result of this union there developed in time the so-called Samaritans.",
                "The Samaritans constituted a considerable population during the existence of the second Temple and for some time after its destruction. Later they assimilated with other Jewish sects to some extent, and the majority of them disappeared entirely.",
                "Whenever the Samaritans are referred to in the Talmud or in the Midrashim, they are called Kuthim. The probable reason for this was that the people of Kutha constituted the most important element among the settlers whom the king of Assyria colonized in Samaria in place of the exiled Israelites. According to the Bible, these people did not observe the Jewish laws and did not believe in God during their first years in Samaria. As a punishment their dwellings were attacked by lions who killed many of them. The king of Assyria was then informed that the people whom he settled in the cities of Samaria in the place of the exiled Israelites did not know the laws of the God who rules there and, in his anger, God set upon them many lions to devour them. The king of Assyria thereupon commanded to have one of the exiled priests sent there to teach the people the laws of the God of Samaria.",
                "One of the priests came and settled in Beth El and he taught the inhabitants to fear the God of Israel. From that time on the inhabitants continued to worship their old idols but they also erected an altar for the offering of sacrifices to the Jewish God. Since these people were converted to belief in the Jewish God because of their fear of the lions, they were called “Lions’ Converts”.",
                "It is also necessary to keep in mind that in so far as the people of the Ten Tribes were descendants of the tribe of Ephraim, they harbored a deep seated hatred for the tribe of Judah, which dated back to the time of the Judges, when the people of Ephraim were warlike, loved to rule and constantly quarrelled with the other tribes. From the tribe of Ephraim descended Jeroboam who rebelled against king Solomon and at a later date detached the kingdom of Israel from the kingdom of the House of David.",
                "133 years passed from the time of the exile of the Ten Tribes till the destruction of the first Temple. The land of Samaria underwent many changes during these years. Assyria ceased to exist and its nations came under the rule of another people. Even before the destruction of Samaria, there was a spiritual kinship between Jerusalem and Samaria, as is indicated by some of the prophets. We may also assume that this relationship between Jerusalem and Samaria continued to exist and was strengthened when the Samarians saw that the God of Judah saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians, a feat which their idols failed to accomplish.",
                "It is probable that many Samarians went to Judea at that time and joined the kingdom of Judah. There are also indications that the king of Judah had some control over Samaria at certain times. Thus we read in Kings 2, 23 that king Josia destroyed the high places in Beth El and in the cities of Samaria. There also exists the possibility that only a small part of the Samarians denied the sacredness of Jerusalem even before the destruction of the first Temple. Thus it is told that after the death of Gedalia ben Achikam there came eighty men from Shechem, from Shiloh and from Samaria with offerings and incense in their hands to sacrifice in the Temple, for they did not know that it had been destroyed.",
                "It is not quite clear what took place among the Samaritans during the 133 years from the exile of Samaria until the destruction of the first Temple, nor later, in the time of the Babylonian captivity. One thing we do know that when the Jews returned to Palestine from Babylonia under the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, and the Samaritans heard that they were planning to build a new temple, they approached Zerubabel and the other leaders of the people and said: “We will gladly participate in your work, for we serve the same God that you do and to him we offer our sacrifices since the time of Esaradon, king of Assyria, who brought us here.”",
                "The Samaritans are there called “the enemies of Judah and Benjamin,” which may serve as proof that the relations between the Samaritans and the Jews of that time were of a hostile nature. The Jews suspected evil intentions on the part of the Samaritans and refused their assistance. According to Josephus Flavius the Jews replied as follows: “Why should you help us when you will be able to use our Temple anyway, for our Temple will be a house of prayer for all nations.”",
                "This refusal to accept the cooperation of the Samaritans revived the old feud between the tribe of Ephraim and the people of Judah. The Samaritans erected their own temple on Mount Gerizim. It is told that when Nehemia came to Jerusalem and found that the son of the High Priest Jojada ben Eliashiv was a son-in-law of Sanbalat the Horonite who hindered the building of the Temple through false reports to the Persian government, he expelled him from Jerusalem.",
                "Josephus offers a somewhat different account. He relates that Manashe, the brother of the High Priest Jojada, married the daughter of Sanbalat the Samaritan. Nehemia commanded him to send away his wife even as he had everyone send away their non-Jewish wives. When Manashe refused to do so, he was driven out from among the Jews. He thereupon went to his father-in-law Sanbalat who built for him a temple on Mount Gerizim, where an altar had already existed for some time, to offer sacrifices, and he appointed him priest of the temple. Josephus continues to relate that many other men of Judea flocked to Samaria because they refused to send away their foreign wives and there they abolished the regulations of Ezra the Scribe. They did other things in order to sanctify Mount Gerizim and even falsified the text of the Torah as suited their purposes.",
                "Ezra the Scribe regulated the form of the Hebrew script at that time. Historians differ as to the reasons for this. However we may safely assume that prior to this the Jews employed the old Phoenician script, which is now used by the Samaritans only, and not the square Assyrian alphabet which we have today. The broad masses of the people were illiterate and the Phoenician letters were difficult to learn. Another motive of Ezra in selecting the Assyrian script was to establish a dividing wall between the Jews and the Samaritans. This choice of an alphabet was approved and carried through by the Great Synagogue.",
                "According to Josephus, Sanbalat built the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim with the consent of Alexander the Great. This consent was granted as a reward for the assistance which the Samaritans extended to him in his war against Tyre.",
                "But according to the Talmud the Samaritan temple no longer existed in the days of Alexander the Great. However, there is an obvious contradiction in the Talmud legend which confuses two events which transpired at widely separated periods, namely, the journey of Simon the Just, together with other Jewish leaders, to meet Alexander the Great who intended to destroy Jerusalem and the destruction of the Samaritan temple by the High Priest Jochanan.",
                "The Talmud relates: The twenty-fifth day of Tebeth is the day of Mount Gerizim on which no eulogies must be delivered. On this day the Kuthim (Samaritans) tried to obtain permission from Alexander the Great to destroy God’s house and he already granted this request. When the news was related to Simon the Just he put on his priestly vestments and taking the best men from among the Jews he put torches in their hands and thus they walked all night to meet the king.",
                "They (the Jews) went on one side and the others (the Samaritans) on the other side until it began to dawn. When morning came and the king saw the Jews he asked his followers: “Who are these?” His people replied: “These are the Jews who revolted against you.” By this they meant to remind the king that the Jews refused to open the gates of Jerusalem for him before he conquered the Persians.",
                "When they arrived in Antipatris the sun rose. As the king saw Simon the Just he descended from his carriage and bowed to him.",
                "Then the king asked the Jews: “What is the purpose of your coming?”",
                "To which they replied: “Is it possible that idol worshippers can persuade you to destroy a house in which prayers are offered for you and your kingdom?”",
                "Who would have that done? the king asked.",
                "These Kuthim who stand before you, the Jews replied.",
                "I give them into your hands, the king answered to this.",
                "The Jews seized the Kuthim and pierced the soles of their feet, they then tied them to their horses and dragged them over the thorns until they came to Mount Gerizim.",
                "When they reached Mount Gerizim they plowed it and sowed it to lentils even as the Kuthim planned to do to the house of our God.",
                "Later this day was set aside as a day of feasting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא ס״ט א׳.</span></i>",
                "With the construction of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim near the city of Shechem, which is located in the very center of Palestine, Sanbalat hoped that it would soon become the religious center for all those for whom the road to Jerusalem was too long. In selecting Mount Gerizim he believed that he did the best thing possible because there God’s blessing was pronounced on those who follow his commandments.",
                "In later years the priests of the temple on Mount Gerizim attempted to persuade the people that the Torah was handed down from Mount Gerizim and not from Mount Sinai as the Jews claimed. To lend strength to this contention, the text of the Torah was falsified. But this attempt did not succeed and the claim was afterward dropped.",
                "From that time the struggle between the Jews and Samaritans gained in intensity. Often it was a struggle of ideas, each side claiming that the truth was on its side. On other occasions it took the form of bloody wars which lasted for centuries. The mutual hatred between the contending sides was so strong that even in times of relative peace it was considered a good deed to kill a member of the opposing side. Every time the Jews were attacked by enemies the Samaritans made common cause with these enemies, with two notable exceptions, the destruction of the second Temple and the siege of Betar.",
                "How deeply rooted was the hatred between the Jews and Samaritans we can see best from the writings of Josephus, although he might have been prejudiced against them because in his time they fought on the side of the Jews against the Romans. But this hatred of the two peoples is also mentioned earlier in the books of the Maccabees and Ben Sira says of them that he is “disgusted with the shameful people who dwell in Shechem.”",
                "When the Hasmoneans warred against the Greeks, Josephus relates, the Samaritans allied themselves with the enemies of the Jews and, at the time that religious Jews were tortured and persecuted by the Greeks, the Samaritans wrote to Antiochus Epiphanes: “We are not Jews and we do not recognize the Jewish God. If to this day we observed the Jewish Sabbath and other Jewish feast days, we did so not out of our own choice but through compulsion. If the king disapproves of our going in the ways of the Jews and our worshipping their God, we will return to the Gods of our forefathers and we will dedicate our temple to Zeus.”",
                "After the victory of the Hasmoneans, the Samaritans joined with the nations about Palestine and sought to incite them to war against the Jews. Their hatred of the Jews was very great. It was for this reason that Jochanan Hyrcanos conducted against them a war of annihilation and destroyed their temple two hundred years after it was founded.",
                "He was followed by his two sons who, although they fought amongst themselves, were united in their hatred of the Samaritans. When they conquered the city of Samaria, they leveled it with the ground and plowed up the site of the temple. The inhabitants fled the city to save their lives. Only much later, when Jerusalem was occupied by the Romans under Pompey, were the Samaritans returned to their dwellings.",
                "The religious relations between the Jews and Samaritans varied with the times. Since the Samaritans resided among Jews for hundreds of years, legislation concerning them did not always follow the same system. At times they were considered as idol worshippers and it was told that their temple contained an image resembling a dove which they worshipped. On other occasions some of the Talmudic scholars maintained that the Samaritans should be considered Jews.",
                "It was thus only natural that the Samaritans too should invent all kinds of stories about the Jews. Their main contention was that they were the real Jews and that only they observed all the commandments of the Torah. In order to prove that the Jews did not properly observe the laws of purity they did the following. On a certain Passover, when the Jews were gathered in Jerusalem, they placed the bones of a dead person among the wood which was kept near the altar in order to desecrate the Temple. But this action did not have the effect which the Samaritans anticipated. The scholars declared that after the bones were removed the Temple was pure again and argued that such dead bones do not have the power of profaning the Temple. Since no one knows where are the bones of the people that were drowned during the flood nor those of the victims of Nebuchadnezzar who destroyed the first Temple, it is entirely possible that some of those bones are interred near the Temple. Nevertheless, they said, no one would claim that the Temple is desecrated because of such bones.",
                "At other times the Samaritans tried to spite the Jews. When the latter lit fires on the mountains to announce to far-away residents that a new month was beginning, the Samaritans sometimes put out these fires in order to cause erroneous celebration of the feast days.",
                "At the time of the destruction of the second Temple, the Samaritans were the allies of the Jews in their struggle against the Romans. The Romans did not distinguish between Jews and Samaritans. The same was the case in the wars of Bar Kochba.",
                "After the destruction of the second Temple the Samaritans remained in their city and their shrine continued to exist. Only about 150 years later they revolted against the Romans. The emperor Septimus Severus vanquished them, he destroyed the city of Samaria and killed its inhabitants. The same thing happened when the Romans warred against the Persians and the Samaritans helped the Persians.",
                "The opinions of the Talmudic scholars concerning the Samaritans were not always the same. The great disputes occurred when both the Samaritan and the Jewish temples were in existence. Later the opinion prevailed that the Samaritans were true converts and according to Rabbi Simeon Ben Gamaliel a Samaritan was the equal of a Jew in every respect.",
                "Sharply opposed to the Samaritans were the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer who said that “one who eats the bread of a Samaritan is like one who eats pork.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שביעית ח׳ י׳.</span></i> Other scholars were milder in their attitude and permitted partaking of Samaritan food.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ה׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>"

                "T<small>HE FEW DECADES</small> which the Jews spent in Babylonia, from the exile of Jehoyachin king of Judea till their return under Cyrus king of Persia, deeply influenced their spiritual development in so far as the outward manifestations of the Jewish religion were concerned. It was from the Babylonians that they learned to identify angels by name. In all the books of the Bible preceding the book of Daniel, angels are referred to without names. According to the story of the Torah and the Prophets, angels were created by God’s wish to perform a definite mission. When that mission was completed, the angel would vanish without a name even as he appeared without a name.",
                "Only after their return from the Babylonian captivity did the Jews begin to name the angels according to their function. Raphael became the angel of healing. Gabriel was the angel of strength and victory and Michael became the defender of the Jewish people.",
                "In order to obtain a clearer understanding of the political situation we must remember that from the time of the return of the exiles till the breakdown of the Persian empire there prevailed comparative political stability. The Jews gathered internal strength and fortified the foundations of their religious and national life. But we have not received the name of any person of that period who could be said to have been the leader of the people.",
                "The leadership was concentrated in the hands of the High Priest and of the group of people known as “Soferim”, scribes, who copied the holy writings. No unusual activity went on. The people stayed within their modest boundaries and diligently devoted themselves to the rebuilding of their homes and lands, seemingly indifferent to whom they paid their taxes or who ruled the land.",
                "Only much later, in the days of Artaxerxes III (362-338 B. C.) did trouble begin when the Egyptians tried to liberate themselves from the yoke of the Persians. The Persian armies marched into Palestine on their way to Egypt. The Egyptians too did not wait until their land was invaded and proceeded to meet them. Both armies met in Palestine and there the battle was fought.",
                "The Jews were thus forced to provide for both armies. Each of the contending sides tried to gain their support but they remained neutral in this conflict. The war ended with the withdrawal of Persia from Egypt, and Palestine became the apple of discord between the two powers each of whom desired to possess it for strategic reasons.",
                "Meanwhile there set in a spiritual decline within the Persian nation. When the Persians conquered Babylonia and other Asiatic lands they found the inhabitants worshipping various gods of fertility and indulging in immorality as a form of piety. The Persian king Artaxerxes III introduced this type of worship into all the lands of his domain. The new form of worship strained the loyalty of the Jews towards the Persians because it ran contrary to all their concepts of religion. As the king devoted himself to the new cult he refrained from active participation in matters of state and entrusted the conduct of the government to his officials. One of these officials was put in charge of Jerusalem; another official, named Bagases, assassinated the king and his whole household and assumed the throne.",
                "It was to this ruler that Joshua, the son of the High Priest Joyada, appealed to have himself appointed High Priest after the death of his father instead of his older brother Jochanan, who was the legitimate heir. When Joyada died, he attempted to claim his office and was killed within the Temple by his older brother. Upon hearing this the governor hastened to Jerusalem to avenge his friend but, having arrived, he did nothing to the murderer and utilized the opportunity to plunder the Temple. In addition he imposed upon the Jews a fine of fifty golden Drachmas to be paid daily and he entered the Holy of Holies which he stripped of all valuables.",
                "Seven years later saw the beginning of the wars of Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia, in which he conquered all the domains of the Persians. Some of these battles were also fought on Palestine soil. The prophet Daniel described those wars as he foresaw them in his dream: \"… The four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts, different one from another, came up out of the sea. The first was like a lioness and had the wings of an eagle; I beheld till her wings were plucked off and she was lifted up from the earth, and stood upon her feet as a man, and the heart of a man was given to her. And behold another beast like a bear stood up on one side and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth…. After this I beheld another like a tiger which had on its back four wings of a fowl and also four heads…. After this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and exceedingly strong and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped the residue with its feet.” (Daniel, 7.)",
                "The High Priest at that time was Simon the Just who was a direct descendant of the High Priest Joshua, the first after the return from the Babylonian captivity. The personality of Simon the Just is veiled in legend and it is difficult to establish the exact years of his life. The generally accepted date of his death is about 310 B. C. Some historians claim he lived at a later date. But it is certain that he was the last of the Great Synagogue and that this institution was abolished in his time.",

But the Jews of the surrounding countries (Babylonia, Persia, Egypt) lived under more favorable circumstances and they refrained from coming to Jerusalem. With the weakening of the atachment to Jerusalem, they strove to establish spiritual centers within the countries of their residence. One competing Temple, the temple of the Samaritans, already existed on Mount Gerizim. It had for its High Priest Menashe, the son-in-law of Sanbalat the Horonite, whom Nehemiah expelled from Jerusalem.",

                "During the service of the Day of Atonement, two he goats were placed near the High Priest, one on his right and one on his left. Lots were cast to determine which one would be sacrificed as a sin offering and which one would be sent to Azazel in the desert, and each time the lot of being the sin offering fell to the goat on the right side of the priest.",
                "The second wonder was the changing of the red string. A red string was tied around the neck of the goat being sent to Azazel. After the goat was thrown from the top of the precipice and it was cut to pieces in the fall, the red string which remained in the hands of the messenger turned white. This was a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven.",

But in spite of the fact that the westernmost lamp was lit first it continued burning even when the oil in the other lamps was already consumed.",

As a protest against those Jews who indulged in extravagant living there appeared Nazarites who renounced all of these pleasures. Of these Simon the Just disapproved because he considered it a sin to renounce pleasures which God created for the benefit of people. He made only one exception to this rule and of this he tells himself:",
                "There once came to me a man who had beautiful curly hair and he wanted to cut his hair because he ended the period of being a Nazarite. I asked him, “My son, what made you decide to cut off your beautiful hair?” And the man answered me, “I am a shepherd for my father. Once, when I went to the spring to draw water for the cattle, I looked at my image in the water and I was tempted to be proud of my beautiful appearance and thus to lose my life through sin. So I said to myself, ‘Wicked man, you are proud of something which is not yours, and you will, at any rate, turn to forms. I therefore swore to cut off this hair in honor of the Almighty.’”",

The animal also had to be without fault and must never have been put to work. Such an animal was therefore very rare and it was considered a miracle that two such were found during the forty years of his priesthood. In spite of the fact that sometimes as high a price as sixty measures of gold were paid for such an animal, there were only nine such sacrificed during the existence of both Temples. Legend has it that the tenth one will not be found until the coming of the Messiah.",

The Jews informed him that they cannot do so because they swore loyalty to king Darius the Mede. Hearing this Alexander announced to his soldiers that he would take revenge. When the Jews heard that Alexander was marching on Jerusalem with a great army they were stricken with fear.

He therefore refused to do him any harm and believed that being kind to him would bring him luck in the coming wars.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to Josephus, the name of this High Priest was Jaddua, but we will accept the opinion of the Talmud that it was Simon the Just, the grandson of Jaddua.</i>",

Simon the Just answered that this was impossible because the Jewish faith does not allow images in the Temple. But he promised to immortalize the memory of Alexander’s kindness in another manner. He had all the boys, who were born that year, named Alexander. The king liked this idea even better than having his statue near the altar.",

Alexander asked them to debate the question with the Jews of Jerusalem in his presence. The spokesman of the Jews was one Gabiha ben Pasisa who, with his sensible arguments, destroyed the claims of the Samaritans. When Alexander acknowledged the Jews to be the victors of the debate, the Samaritans fled.",

Among them were the Kiddush and Havdalah, the blessings over wine on Friday eve and Saturday night and the regulation that even the poorest person must drink no less than four glasses of wine at the Seder on Passover eve. With the consent of the Great Court in Jerusalem the blessings over food were established. The reading of the Haftorah was introduced for Saturdays and feast days. Since the Samaritans did not acknowledge the sanctity of the Prophets an appropriate chapter from the Prophets was selected to be read each week.",

Simon the Just had the building repaired and had verandas built around it. Jerusalem suffered a shortage of water and much water was also required for the Temple service. The priests had to perform ablutions several times a day and even an ordinary person had to bathe before entering the precincts of the Temple. Simon the Just dug a well under the ground near the Temple from which an aqueduct was later built to bring sufficient water to the city through copper pipes.",
                "Immediately after the Day of Atonement of the year in which he died, Simon the Just announced that he would die. When he was asked how he knew this, he said that on every Day of Atonement, when he entered the Holy of Holies to perform the service, he saw an old man dressed in white who used to leave the Holy of Holies together with him. That year the old man was dressed in black and did not leave the Holy of Holies with him. It happened just as he predicted. Seven days after Succoth he became ill and died.",
                "Simon the Just was survived by two sons, Shimei and Onias, of whom Onias was the wiser and more capable. Simon the Just wanted Onias to succeed him to the High Priesthood. But Shimei intrigued among the people against the will of his father and caused them to believe that a man such as Simon the Just would not want his younger son to take precedence over the older. Disappointed, Onias left for Alexandria in Egypt where there existed a large Jewish community of over a million people. There he established a competing temple (the house of Onias) with an altar for the offering of sacrifices to the God of Israel even as the Samaritans had their Temple on Mount Gerizim."

He had numerous disciples among whom were many non-priests. Antigonos of Socho was one of the latter and he came to occupy the position of Simon the Just in the continuation of scholastic development.",
                "There is even some doubt as to whether Antigonos was the direct successor of Simon the Just or whether he lived some generations later. But since history does not mention any intermediate personality between the two, we can rely on the Mishnah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אָבות פרק א׳ משנה ג׳.</span></i> that Antigonos received his knowledge directly from Simon the Just.",
                "The name Antigonos, which is Greek, is characteristic of the time. We already described how the name Alexander came to be accepted among Jews and it is possible that the name Antigonos was popularized in a similar manner. One of the Greek governors of Palestine, Antigonos by name, showed kindness to the Jews and out of gratitude to him they decided to immortalize his name. However, it is more logical to assume that the Hellenist movement which sought to bring the Jews closer to Greek customs was already in vogue at that time, for we find many Greek names in popular use such as Antigonos, Aristobul, Boetus and others. Even the “Great Court” in Jerusalem was known by the Greek name “Synhedrion” and this name was later sanctified through popular use. During the time of Antigonos there developed a crisis in Jewish thought; it is probable that the spirit of philosophic doubt became prevalent in the country and, against his will, Antigonos contributed to its spread.",

Two of his pupils, Zadok and Boetus, who heard his words said: What can be the meaning of these words? Can a person expect that his servant work for him all day without receiving compensation? We must conclude that our teacher would not say so if he believed in a life to come and the resurrection of the dead.",
                "Zadok and Boetus thereupon founded a new mode of living and organized a new party which came to be known as Sadducees or Boetusians. This party began to imitate the extravagant mode of living of the Greeks under the following pretext: Why should a person deny himself the pleasures of life if he can await nothing after death? In time this party evolved new forms of observing Judaism which were different from those of the majority of the people, they clung to the literal meaning of the commandments of the Torah as against the traditions of the scholars. For that reason they denied the resurrection of the dead and also the theory of compensation and punishment in a life to come. They ridiculed the belief of the masses that a new redemption would be brought by a Messiah since the conditions then prevailing could not be the culmination of the dreams of the prophets.",
                "Jews very particularly observed all regulations pertaining to the “uncleanliness of the dead.” Upon dying a person ceased to exist for his family and friends and the body was given over to strangers for burial. The Sadducees considered this procedure disrespectful toward one’s parents since one could not be sure what was done with the bodies. In rejecting the traditions they insisted that the commandment “an eye for an eye” should be interpreted literally and not, as the Talmudic scholars claimed, that monetary compensation was sufficient.",
                "Antigonos lived in a time of constant wars between the kings of Egypt and Syria. Palestine was frequently the battle-ground of the warring armies and it was impossible to maintain order and to assure the security of life. Plunderers invaded the land from outside and when these left, the population was further impoverished by domestic banditry. Learning was on the decline. In a time of changes it was necessary to modify the Torah to adapt it to the needs of the day, but there was no one capable of doing this. As a result of this the people neglected their studies and Judaism was being forgotten. For nearly a hundred years the people lived in ignorance and spiritual poverty until the historical circumstances changed when the throne of Syria was occupied by a king who interfered with the religious life of the Jews and undertook to destroy the entire Jewish religion",
                "Alexander the Great followed the principle of religious tolerance toward the peoples of his empire. This principle was adhered to by his followers. Any deviation from the religious observances on the part of the Jews occurred as a result of their own neglect. This condition lasted until Antiochus Epiphanes of Syria attempted to impose his religion on all the peoples of his kingdom. Among the Jews this attempt led to the revolt of the Hasmoneans which started a new epoch in Jewish history.",
                "The belief that God protects the Jewish nation and will punish their enemies was deeply rooted among the people. They believed that the historical events chronicled in the Torah were not related just as historical events but that their aim was to teach the people to understand the rules according to which the world was being governed This was held to be the intention of Moses in describing the war with Amalek so that coming generations may know how to deal with the Amalekites who warred against the Jews in their wanderings in the desert after their first liberation.",
                "Considerable attention was also given to the Hebrew language. Upon returning from Babylonia the people spoke a mixture of the neighboring languages together with Hebrew. Later the Syrian Greek language predominated. The court of the Hasmoneans then commanded that Hebrew should be employed as the spoken language. This ancient language had lost some of the power of its expression, but it developed again until it could be used to express all concepts.",

This period lasted for about five generations and was called the time of the “Pairs” because two men simultaneously led and governed the people. One of the two was generally the Nasi (Chief) and the other was called, the “Av Beth Din,” the father of the court.",
                "At first these “Pairs” were in complete agreement on all fundamental issues and differed only on minor religious questions. Later these disagreements increased and reached the point of severe disputes which engendered dangerous bitterness.",
                "In all there were five such “pairs”: 1) Jose b. Joezer of Zereda and Jose b. Jochanan of Jerusalem; 2) Joshua b. Perachia and Nittai of Arbella; 3) Jehuda b. Tabai and Simeon b. Shetach; 4) Shemaia and Avtalion; 5) Hillel and Shammai. The reverence with which the teachings of these leaders were considered is illustrated by the statement of one of their followers, Nachum Halavlar (the Scribe): “I received a tradition from Rabbi Miasha, who received it from his father, who heard it from the “Pairs” who received it from the Prophets as a law handed down to Moses from Mount Sinai.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּאה פרק ב׳ משנה י׳.</span></i> This saying indicates the mood of the people who believed that every word of the “Pairs” was a law handed down to Moses from Mount Sinai.",
                "The first “pair” lived in the days of the High Priest Alkimos who allied himself with the Greeks against the Jews under the reign of Demetrius Soter (about 300 B. C.). This High Priest met with considerable opposition from the pious elements who objected to his treacherous actions and attempted to lead the people along the true paths.",
                "Jewish history has known such dual leadership even before the time of Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. Thus we find Jehoshaphat the fourth king of Judea after Solomon, appointing two leaders to conduct the government. One, the priest Amariah, was the authority of the Word of God and the other, Zachariah b. Ishmael, was the lord of the commands of the king. After the return from the Babylonian captivity we find Zerubabel the secular leader and Jeshua b. Jozadak as High Priest. Still later the government was shared by Ezra and Nehemia. But in spite of this condition of dual leadership and the rarity of two leaders cooperating amicably, there arose no disputes among the first “Pair” except in the matter of one ritual question on which Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan could not agree. This question was also disputed by the later “pairs.” It involved the problem of placing one’s hands on a sacrifice on a feast day.",
                "The Bible enjoined a person to “place his hand” on the sacrifice which he brought and this was interpreted to mean that he was to assist in the slaughtering of the animal. Since this procedure involved a considerable effort it was held by some that a person should not do so on the Sabbath or on a feast day. Others maintained that the restrictions of the Sabbath are not operative in the Temple and the individual must therefore assist in the slaughtering of the sacrifice if it is to be offered according to the law.",
                "The procedure of the “placing of hands” was as follows. The animal to be sacrificed was placed on the North side of the slaughter house and faced to the West. The person bringing the offering stood on the East facing the West. Then he placed his hands between the horns of the animal and confessed the sins for the atonement of which he brought the sacrifice. Those who prohibited this procedure of placing of hands on a feast day believed that it involved an effort and was therefore unnecessary; the others considered the whole procedure and the confession as sanctifying the sacrifice and permitted this effort in the Temple.",
                "The problem of the Jews living outside of Palestine who sent their sacrifices to Jerusalem was of paramount importance in the discussion of this question. The decision involved the acceptance of the sacrifice without the presence of the penitent or a demand that the penitent must be present during the offering of the sacrifice. Those who permitted the offering of a sacrifice on a feast day without the presence of the owner feared that any undue severity might tend to encourage those Jews living outside of Palestine to erect altars wherever they live and thus to compete with the Temple in Jerusalem; they feared that it might even lead to idolatry. Those who opposed this leniency were motivated by opposition to the Sadducees who tried to make the regulations of conduct on the Sabbath or a feast day so severe as to be impossible of observance.",
                "Two other decrees were introduced by Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. They declared all countries surrounding Palestine as impure where no Jew may live. One who does live in any of these lands must perform numerous ablutions and rites of purification before he may enter Palestine. In issuing this decree it was apparently aimed to limit the dispersion of the Jews among the neighboring nations, which was assuming large proportions due to the persecutions of the Greek government. This decree caused great hardships to those who refused to submit to the laws of the Palestine administration which attempted to eradicate Judaism. The second decree promulgated by them declared all glass vessels which were made by non Jews to be impure even as earthen dishes were.",
                "In passing it is worth mentioning that both of these decrees were done away with in time. Even observing Jews settled in Gentile lands in later years and glass vessels were considered pure after being rinsed in water. Jose b. Joezer also introduced three rules which lightened the burden of the laws. During years of famine, when the people could not identify the four types of locust which the Bible permits to be used as food, he gave his sanction to the use of a locust which invaded the country from Babylonia. He permitted the people to use the water and the blood from the sacrificial slaughter house for household purposes and as garden fertilizer. He also declared that only the person who comes in direct contact with a dead body or an impure object is impure but such a person does not convey the impurity to other people. This declaration was of special significance due to the preparations which were then going on for a rebellion against the Greeks who persecuted the Jewish faith. Many were reluctant to go to war out of fear of becoming contaminated through contact with people that touched dead bodies. It was for this reason that Jose b. Joezer announced that only the first person touching a dead body is impure.",
                "Jose b. Joezer is credited with the following moral saying: “Let thy house be a place of meeting for the wise and dust thyself with the dust of their feet and drink their words with thirst.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אָבות פרק א׳ משנה ד׳.</span></i> These words were directed against the government which aimed to separate the people from their teachers; anyone who converted his home into a place of instruction risked his very life if he was caught.",

In this turmoil little attention was paid by the people to learning and ignorance prevailed. The general tendency was to imitate the customs of the Gentiles, and the idea was current that Jews should assimilate with the ruling Greek nation. Among the first Greek customs to become popular were athletics and public tournaments. Many Jews were persuaded that their national welfare would be enhanced by training in the various sports and gladiatorial excercises. There might have been but little objection to these sports in themselves were it not for the Greek habit of engaging in these sports while altogether nude. It happened that when Jewish young men engaged in these exercises, they were ashamed of being circumcised and in various artificial manners tried to graft foreskins so as not to be recognized as Jews.",

The friends of the Greeks were denounced as “traitors to the covenant”, “dregs of the people” and “profaners of the holy covenant.” The assimilationist elements considered the pious people to be fools who observe strange ceremonies which hinder a closer understanding between Jews and Greeks, and before very long, the friends of the Greeks called on the government to come to their assistance in their struggle against the pious Jews."

There was also no lack of Jewish traitors who assisted the enemy in his work and it seemed that the last hour had struck for the Jewish religion. Pious Jews sought safety in the mountains and caves of Judea, hidden from the eyes of strangers. There they observed the laws of Judaism and avoided desecrating the Sabbath; there too they inducted the new born children into the Jewish faith.",
                "In the town Modiim, not far from Ludd, there gathered a group of the faithful. One of the priests, Mattathias ben Jochanan of the Hasmonean family, who could trace his descent from the priest Jojariv, erected an altar to the God of Israel. When the representative of the government heard of this he sent an officer with a detachment of soldiers to investigate the situation. The Greek officer called Mattathias and commanded him to sacrifice a pig on the altar. To this Mattathias replied: “Were all the people of the king’s domains to worship your god and were all the Jews to join them in this worship, I and my sons would still not deviate from the ways of my forefathers and I will not serve any other God but the only living God in Heaven.”",
                "Then one of the Jews approached the altar to fulfill the command of the officer. Mattathias thereupon stabbed him with a knife and killed him. As the Greek officer tried to attack Mattathias, he and his soldiers were set upon by the surrounding people and were slaughtered.",

This deed of Mattathias therefore acted as a call to battle and a long and bitter war ensued. The Greeks could bring onto the field of battle many more well equipped soldiers than the Jews could. The Jews therefore feared to face them in open battle and conducted a guerilla form of warfare. Judas Macabbee, the son of Mattathias, fell in one of these battles and he was succeeded by his brother Jochanan who led the Jewish forces to victory in several engagements. With the consent of the king, Jochanan assumed the high priesthood which he held for but a short time until he was betrayed to the enemy and killed. Simeon, the youngest son of Mattathias, then assumed the leadership of the people and also successfully completed the war of liberation.",

                "It is probable that this court did not come into existence before the rule of Jonathan, son of Mattathias. When Jonathan sent letters to the Lacedemonians to renew the alliance against the Syrians, we find these letters signed by men of the “Great Council.” When Simeon became Nasi, we read that this position was given to him by the “Elders” and the “Heads of the people.” These men apparently were the members of the “Court of the Hasmoneans.”",

                "It was this court which established an annual feast of eight days to commemorate the miracles which transpired during the war with the Greeks. This feast came to be called “Chanukah,” dedication, because it was originally celebrated to rededicate the altar which the Greeks profaned with unclean sacrifices. Although many feast days to commemorate various triumphs of the Macabbees were in vogue at that time, only Chanukah with its lights and singing of praise continued to be celebrated throughout the years and was sanctioned by the Hasmonean court.",
                "In addition to the new regulations, the ultra pious voluntarily assumed many other restrictions. Prayers which were introduced by the Great Synagogue were already in common use but before beginning to recite them it became customary to devote a few minutes to spiritual communion with “the father in heaven.” This spiritual communion they would not interrupt under any circumstances were even a king to drive by or were a snake to wind itself about the foot of the suppliant. Disregarding all perils, the ultra pious were ready to face any danger if only it would enable them to observe the laws of the Torah. The observance of the Sabbath was held in special esteem so that even the killing of a poisonous snake on that day was considered to be sinful. At first they even refused to fight their enemies on the Sabbath and history records one case during the lifetime of Mattathias when one thousand Jews were burned to death in a cave to which the Greek soldiers set fire because they did not want to desecrate the Sabbath by putting out the fire. After this occurrence Mattathias instructed all his followers to desecrate the Sabbath if necessary when fighting the enemy.",

The past sinners would begin their song with the words, “Praised be he who never sinned” and the chorus responded “He who sinned shall be forgiven.” Then those who felt free of wrong doing intoned, “Praised be my youth which did not bring shame on my old age” and the sinners of the past joined with, “Praised be my old age which atones for the transgressions of my youth.”",
                "The court of the Hasmoneans was systematically strict in the enforcement of those laws which did not cause any losses to the people but practiced leniency where the legislation was becoming intolerably severe as in the cases of the Nazarites and of the Passover offering. These lenient or strict interpretations were based on new studies of the text of the Bible to every letter of which great significance was being ascribed. The scholars of that time also began to ponder the events of Jewish history and attempted to explain the causes of the great suffering which Jews had to endure. They came to the conclusion that all injury inflicted on the Jews invariably is avenged on the evil doers. Thus Amalek tried to destroy them and he was wiped off the face of the earth. Pharaoh enslaved the Jews and caused their children to be cast into the river so the Egyptians were drowned in the sea. This, they reasoned, must be the fate of every nation which does harm to the Jews; to be repaid with the same measure.",
                "Simeon, the son of Mattathias the Hasmonean, was assassinated in a treacherous fashion by his son in law Ptolemy ben Chabub who occupied the post of tax collector in the district of Shechem. Feeling secure after his triumph over the Greeks, Simeon frequently accepted the invitations of his son in law to visit him together with his family. It was on one of these visits that he was murdered by Ptolemy who was secretly negotiating with the Greek rulers to have himself appointed governor of the country after the death of Simeon. But Ptolemy’s hopes proved to be vain. The king of Syria did not fulfill his promise and Simeon’s son Jochanan succeeded his father. Jochanan united within himself both the religious and the secular authority over the people as prince and High Priest.",
                "Historically Jochanan is known as John Hyrcanus or Hyrcanus the first to distinguish him from king Hyrcanus II who was the grandfather of queen Miriam the Hasmonean. In the Talmud he is called Jochanan the High Priest. The surname Hyrcanus he obtained from his conquest of the fortress Hyrcania.",
                "After Ptolemy murdered Jochanan’s father he held his mother as hostage for fear of reprisals from Jochanan. When Jochanan stormed Ptolemy’s fortress and it seemed that it might fall, Ptolemy led his mother in law to the wall of the castle and there he tortured her in sight of her son. Jochanan was ready to withdraw in order to spare his mother any more suffering but she exhorted him in the name of his father not to be affected by her injuries and to exert every effort to take the fortress. But the stronghold was well fortified and he could not conquer it. Seeking for an excuse to retreat without shame, Jochanan declared that the new year, which was just then beginning, was a sabbatical year during which no wars might be waged. Ptolemy murdered his mother in law and fled after which he was never heard of again.",
                "Shortly after this event Jochanan was again involved in war with the Greeks who, under their new king Antiochus Sedetis, attempted to regain control of the country. They advanced on Jerusalem with a great army but they could not take it. The power of the Greeks was broken and they feared the intervention of Rome which was bound by treaty to assist the Jews. After much fighting a new peace was declared according to which the Jews had to pay 500 measures of silver and to deliver a number of young men from the noble families as hostages. In time the relations with the Syrian Greek kingdom improved to such an extent that Jochanan even sent military assistance to their king in his wars against the Parthians.",
                "Jochanan was engaged in many protracted wars until he finally succeeded in completely freeing his country. With the aid of gold treasures which he found in the tombs of the kings of Judea he hired a mercenary army and marched on the Idumeans. To them he offered the choice of accepting the Jewish faith or being exiled. The Idumeans preferred to accept the Jewish religion rather than be driven out of their homes. Jochanan then attacked Samaria which he destroyed together with the Samaritan temple which was the greatest hindrance to the existence of the Temple in Jerusalem.",
                "As a result of these conquests it became necessary to introduce new regulations which should fit the newly created conditions. Among the conquered cities there were some which were previously a part of Syria and as such were considered unclean where no Jew might live. These cities were now considered a part of Palestine and were subject to all the laws pertaining to tithes, the sabbatical year, the bringing of the first fruits, the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and the offering of sacrifices. The rule was established that if one buys a field in Syria it is as if he bought a field in a suburb of Jerusalem, and all the newly conquered cities which could be reached without passing through foreign territory were considered to be the equals of the holy Palestine towns. In this manner Jochanan extended the boundaries of Palestine to include Syria in the possession of the Jews even as he did with the cities of Idumea.",
                "Some of the regulations relating to the bond of Syria with Palestine were changed at a later date; it also soon became evident that the Idumeans who were converted by force did not add to the well being of the Jewish people. But the sincerity of the intentions of Jochanan was appreciated by all and even though, in later years, he came in conflict with the scholars, the Talmud nevertheless credits him for his good intentions.",
                "Other religious innovations were directed against the Samaritans (Kuthim) who mingled with the other Jews after the destruction of their temple but in their hearts still bore a great hatred toward them. This hatred caused uneasiness and the Samaritans were mistrusted; their adherence to the Jewish people was questioned even though they seemed to observe some customs even more strictly than did the Jews. It was then forbidden to partake of the food of a Samaritan and eating of the bread of a Samaritan was considered to be the same as eating pork.",
                "Among his other innovations, the High Priest Jochanan also did away with reciting the dedication which was prescribed for all men who brought the tithe. He sent out messengers throughout the cities of Palestine to see whether the tithes were properly contributed. These messengers reported to him that the Palestine farmers gave only the “Large tithe,” the exact amount of which was never established; they therefore offered only between two and three percent. When Jochanan heard this he ordered that whoever bought grain or fruit from a farmer (Am Haaretz) should not ask whether the tithes were already given from that produce and he was obliged to offer the necessary amount even though the seller assured him that the tithes were already given. It was for this reason that he abolished the confession during the offering of tithes; out of fear that a falsehood might be uttered before God if a person should say that he gave the proper tithes.",
                "The difficulties with the giving of tithes began during the days of Ezra. Since not all the Levites wanted to return to Palestine from Babylonia, Ezra fined those who refused to return by taking away their rights to the tithe. It thus became impossible to include the words “and I gave it to the Levite” which are contained in the Biblical text of the confession of the tithes. Others thought that since the tithes were frequently collected by force it would not be true to confess that the tithes were “given.” The High Priest Jochanan also realized that the conditions affecting the tithes changed radically. During the days of the first Temple, Palestine was divided among the tribes and the Levites did not possess any lands; they were thus entitled to the tithes. But in his time conditions were different and the tithes weighed heavily on the farmers who had to pay taxes in addition to the three different kinds of tithes (first tithe, second tithe, tithe for the poor). Realizing the injustice of this condition and being powerless to abolish the commandment of the Torah, he introduced a new system. He appointed overseers to watch that the farmers obey the law and to take the tithes by force if necessary. But when a person bought produce from a farmer he did not have to inquire whether tithes were given but had to consider his purchase as “Dmai”, doubtful produce, from which the buyer had to give the tithes.",
                "Until the time of Jochanan it was customary to work in Jerusalem in the period intervening between the first and last day of a holiday and the pounding of hammers was heard throughout the city. Jochanan considered this a profanation of the holy city and he forbade it. When in later years it was altogether forbidden to work with hammers in Jerusalem the new regulation was based on Jochanan’s ordinance.",
                "He also did away with the singing of Psalm 48 by the Levites during the service. Verse 24 of this Psalm reads “Awake, why do you slumber Lord.” It came to be chanted at a time when the Jews were sorely pressed on all sides while the other nations lived in peace. But Jochanan held that it is disrespectful to ask God to awake from slumber. He also changed the procedure of offering sacrifices. Previously it was customary to make an incision between the horns of the animal to be slaughtered with a sharp knife in order that the blood might blind it and make it easier to bind. Jochanan said that this practice was equivalent to crippling the sacrifice as the cut might pierce the animal’s brain and thus make it unfit for sacrifice. He ordered that a ring be made to be placed on the neck of the animal and thus facilitate its binding.",
                "In the observance of the commandments of the Torah, Jochanan always sided with the Pharisees. But once, during the closing years of his life the Pharisees incurred his anger and he forsook them to take the part of the Sadducees. It happened during a feast which he gave after one of his victories, that, flushed with wine he challenged the assembled to mention any evil which they knew of him. One of the guests, Eleazar ben Poirah, whom the Talmud calls “a wicked and hard hearted scoffer,” said to Jochanan: “The Pharisees are displeased with you.” When Jochanan inquired for the cause of the displeasure, there rose an old man Jehudah ben Gadidiah and said: “Enough that you have the crown of royalty; leave the crown of the priesthood for a pious descendant of Aaron for you are the son of a woman who was held in captivity.” (He was referring to the fact that Jochanan’s mother was held captive among the Gentiles which may have cast some doubt on his parentage.) Very much concerned, Jochanan had the whole matter investigated and when the statement was not substantiated Jehuda ben Gadidia was tried by the Sanhedrin and sentenced to be flogged.",
                "But Jochanan was not satisfied with this punishment and the Sadducees further incited him to believe that all the Pharisees thought as Jehuda ben Gadidia did. As Jochanan tried to justify the verdict of the Sanhedrin on the ground that the Torah commands that a slanderer be flogged, the above mentioned Eleazar ben Poirah said: “True this is the law for one who slanders an ordinary person, but in this case where a king and High Priest was slandered, the Sanhedrin should have acted differently.”",
                "Jochanan allowed himself to be persuaded. He removed all the Pharisees from the Sanhedrin and filled their places with Sadducees. The new Sanhedrin immediately tried Jehuda ben Gadidia a second time and condemned him to death together with a number of other Pharisees. From that time Jochanan remained an adherent of the Sadducees.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This version of the manner in which Jochanan forsook the Pharisees to join the Sadducees is told by Josephus. In the Talmud it is stated that it happened during the reign of king Jannai. However, the reference could not be to Alexander Jannai, the son of Jochanan Hyrcanus, for on another occasion the Talmud states “Jannai and Jochanan are the same person.”</i>"

                "The period of the spiritual activity of the High Priest Jochanan also marked the rise of another “pair” of spiritual leaders. Sympathizing then with the Pharisees, Jochanan recognized the necessity of bringing to the forefront of religious life the two most outstanding scholars, one of whom was to occupy the post of Nasi of the Sanhedrin and the other was to be head of the Supreme Court, even as in the days of Jose b. Joezer and Jose b. Jochanan. He accordingly appointed Joshua ben Perachia Nasi and Nittai of Arbela head of the Supreme Court.",
                "Whatever innovations were introduced by these scholars were credited to Jochanan because, as political and religious leader of the nation, he had sufficient authority to enforce them. But when Jochanan transferred his allegiance to the Sadducees after the Sanhedrin sentenced Jehuda b. Gadidia only to be flogged for slandering him, he removed all the Pharisees from the Sanhedrin and abolished all their legislation. Joshua b. Perachia feared to remain in the country and fled to Egypt where, it may be assumed, he was joined by Nittai of Arbela.",
                "Out of Egypt Joshua b. Perachia wrote to the Jews of Palestine that the wheat shipped from Alexandria should be considered unclean because he believed it was being contaminated by unclean hands in the process of irrigation and fertilization which was being practiced in Egypt. This restriction was based on the text of the Torah (Leviticus, 11). Others explained his prohibition of the use of Alexandrian wheat on the grounds that by using irrigation and other artificial methods to encourage the plant growth, human beings interfere with the natural laws and attempt to improve the natural course of development as it was ordained by God.",
                "But the leaders in Jerusalem refused to abide by this prohibition of Joshua b. Perachia and said that even though he might consider it unclean all other Jews might consider it fit for consumption.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תוספתא מכשירין פרק ג׳.</span></i>",
                "It is regrettable that no mention is made of the relation of Joshua b. Perachia to the temple of Onias in Alexandria. It is possible that he did not openly condemn the temple of Onias because it was held in great reverence by the Jews of Egypt, but secretly he must have been opposed to it. He was too deeply attached to Jerusalem and to its temple to reconcile himself to the idea that Jews can have another temple outside of Jerusalem. He therefore tried to create the impression that whatever comes out of Egypt is impure, both the grain that was shipped out as well as the sacrifices that were offered there.",
                "The manner in which Onias, the son of Simeon the Just, left Jerusalem and erected the “temple of Onias” to compete with the temple in Jerusalem was related in a previous chapter. It is characteristic that the scholars had no definit attitude toward this temple. They were convinced that it was built for sacred purposes and therefore stated that “the temple of Onias is not a house of idolatry.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מגלה י׳ א׳.</span></i>",
                "But in spite of the official sanction which they gave to this temple they never wholeheartedly approved of it. The priests of the temple of Onias they held on a level with priests of Bamoth (high places built for purposes of offering sacrifices) which were built for sacred and not for idolatrous purposes. This type of Bamah was also forbidden during the time that the temple existed, but a Bamah which was erected by an individual for sacred purposes was permitted. They therefore looked upon the temple of Onias as a private Bamah built for sacred purposes.",
                "The Mishna established a rule that whoever vowed to bring a burnt offering in the temple of Onias must offer this sacrifice in the temple in Jerusalem, but if the person sacrificed the burnt offering in the temple of Onias he has fulfilled his vow. Josephus relates that during the civil war between the princes Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, when the Jews of the various cities of Palestine could not go to Jerusalem to sacrifice the Paschal lamb, they went to the temple of Onias to bring this offering.",
                "It is interesting to note the contradictions which characterize Josephus’ writings of the temple of Onias. On one occasion he states that when Onias built this temple he persuaded the king of Egypt that a temple located in Egypt would serve to keep alive the hatred of the Jews toward Antiochus and would arouse their revenge against Antiochus for having destroyed the temple in Jerusalem. Several pages further Josephus maintains that by building this temple Onias sought to avenge himself for the wrong which he considered was done by the Jews of Jerusalem.",

While in prison the queen was allowed to die of starvation. A disagreement between Aristobulus and his brother Antigonos, who was the leader of the army, led to the assassination of Antigonos. Aristobulus died a short time later and was succeeded by his widow Salome. She freed the third son of Jochanan, Alexander Jannai. Alexander married the childless widow of his brother, even though as High Priest he was forbidden to marry a widow, and together they reigned over the land.",

(Some would have it that Jeshu was identical with Jesus, but this is altogether impossible since Jesus lived during the latter part of the reign of Herod. This would place the event in the 160th year of the life of Joshua b. Perachia.) Once, when Joshua lived in Egypt, he was kindly treated by the proprietress of his hostelry. Joshua praised her to his disciples and said: “See what a beautiful woman she is.” The disciple named Jeshu said to him: “Rabbi, she is not beautiful for her eyes are almond shaped.” Thereupon Joshua said to him: “Wicked man, are you concerned with such trifles?” and he drove him away. This disciple returned numerous times to attempt to reconcile his master but Joshua paid no attention to him. Once the disciple came while Joshua was in the midst of reciting the Shema and was ready to forgive him. Joshua motioned to him with his hand to wait until he would complete the prayer. The disciple misunderstood this motion and believed that he was being driven out. He thereupon left and began to devote himself to magic. Joshua went to the house of his disciple to tell him that he would be forgiven if he repented, but he was told that it was too late."

                "Judah b. Tabbai and Simeon b. Shetach were the third of the “pairs” in the series of dual leadership. It is not clear which one of them was Nasi of the Sanhedrin and which one was head of the court. The name of Judah b. Tabbai is listed first whenever they are mentioned together which may lead to the conclusion that he was the Nasi. However, there exists an opinion that Simeon b. Shetach was Nasi and Judah b. Tabbai was head of the Court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">חגיגה ט״ז ב׳.</span></i>",
                "They both lived in an unsettled period. The Sadducees were strongly entrenched in the government of Judea and the struggle with them was difficult and protracted. After the death of the High Priest Jochanan, the throne was assumed by his son Aristobulus and shortly after that it was ascended by his widow who married Alexander Jannai. This marked the beginning of a new epoch for the Pharisees. The new king, who is always referred to under the name of Jannai, was too preoccupied with matters of state to devote himself to the religious problems of the country during the first years of his reign. He therefore left these matters to the queen who referred them to her brother Simeon b. Shetach. Simeon could not free the country of the Sadducee leadership all at once and he therefore proceeded gradually. At first he was the only Pharisee in the Synhedrion. He made it a practice to challenge the decisions of the Synhedrion and to demand that such decisions be authenticated by the text of the Torah. Such proof had to be produced in the presence of the king and queen and he utilized these opportunities to point out that the Sadducees did not interpret the Torah correctly. One by one he managed to remove the Sadducees from the Synhedrion and to replace them with Pharisees.",
                "The conflict between the Sadducees and the Pharisees thus reached a breaking point. The majority of the religious decisions which Simeon b. Shetach sponsored were largely a protest against the opinions of the Sadducees whose influence on Jewish life he tried to eradicate.",

When, upon his return from a victorious war, he realized that the Pharisees had gained the upper hand in the religious life of the land, he decided to humble them. During the festival of Succoth, as he was standing near the altar and preparing to pour water upon it (a custom much in favor with the Pharisees) he poured the water on his feet instead. Greatly enraged, the populace threw their ethrogim at the king and called him insulting names. The king evidently expected this reaction of the people for he previously stationed a number of mercenaries outside the temple. When the disturbance began the soldiers were called in and a terrible slaughter ensued. Later the king had eight hundred Pharisees, who escaped from the temple, also executed.",
                "Many prominent Pharisees then fled from Jerusalem. Some of them sought refuge in Egypt where they were welcomed with open arms while others hid in the mountains and caves of Judea. Among those who hid in the country was also Simeon b. Shetach who realized that his sister, the queen, could defend him no longer.",
                "Judah b. Tabbai sought shelter in Egypt. It is related that just as Simeon b. Shetach recalled Joshua b. Perachia during the first years of the reign of Alexander Jannai, he thus similarly recalled Judah b. Tabbai at a later date. In his letter recalling Joshua b. Perachia Simeon wrote: “From me, the holy city Jerusalem to you, my sister Alexandria. My master resides within you while I am deserted.” When Simeon invited Judah b. Tabbai he wrote: “From the great city of Jerusalem to the small Alexandria! How long will my bridegroom reside with you while I am sorrowing for him?”",

When the assembled were merry with food and drink one of them said: “We remember that a few years ago you had here an old man who entertained us with his wise maxims. Where is he now? Will you call him here?” Jannai looked toward the queen and after he promised her that no harm would befall him, Simeon appeared before the king.",
                "For a short time the persecution of the Pharisees ceased. The king desired to reconcile the people and he sent messengers to inquire of them what he should do to regain their devotion. But the people would not hear of reconciliation and answered that only the death of the king would eradicate the memory of the bloodshed. Some of the Pharisees were not satisfied with this reply and allied themselves with a foreign ruler to oust Alexander Jannai. This still further enraged Jannai against the Pharisees and when he defeated the foreign invader, he had a great number of Pharisees executed.",
                "This last act of revenge stilled the king’s anger against the Pharisees and he persecuted them no more. On the contrary, he became convinced that in order to possess the throne securely, a Jewish sovereign could have no subjects more loyal than the Pharisees.

Shetach resumed his post as head of the Synhedrion (or of the court) and directed all his energies to the struggles with the Sadducees whose teachings he was determined to eradicate. He introduced the law of the “dissenting elder” which prescribed the death sentence for any member of the Synhedrion who opposed a majority in interpreting the law even if the dissenter held to a more severe interpretation or attempted to add to the laws enjoined by the Torah.",

He therefore had eighty “witches” captured and hanged on the same day. Ordinarily he would not have permitted so many women to be executed on the same day even though the Bible commands that witches be put to death.

Simeon addressed the murderer: “Wicked man, it is clear who murdered this man, but you are lucky that I can do nothing to you for the Torah says that two witnesses are required to condemn a criminal while I am the only one who witnessed the crime.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין ל״ז ב׳.</span></i>",
                "That the relations between Simeon b. Shetach and king Jannai were never cordial even when they were together is amply illustrated by numerous stories concerning the two men. Once, it is told, a man was killed by a slave of the king. (Probably one of the king’s mercenaries.) The Synhedrion informed Jannai of the crime and the king sent his servant to face judgment by the court. But the court demanded that the king appear in person since in the eyes of the law a slave was like any other livestock for which its owner is responsible. When Jannai appeared before the Synhedrion he sat down and Simeon b. Shetach said to him: “King Jannai, stand on your feet, not to honor us but in honor of the Creator of the universe.” To this Jannai replied: I will stand only if your colleagues will also demand it. But all the members of the Synhedrion remained silent. Simeon turned to his right and he saw them lower their eyes; he turned to his left and he met the same sight. Simeon thereupon said: Let him who can read your thoughts punish you for your thoughts at this moment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין י״ט א׳.</span></i> Since that time the law was established that a king could not judge nor could he be judged; he was not to be called as a witness nor was anyone to bear testimony against him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין י״ט ב׳.</span></i>",

Until that time women had no right over the property of their husbands. The husband gave to the father of the bride a sum mentioned in the Kethubah. When a man wanted to divorce his wife he said to her: Go and take the money of the Kethubah from your father. Simeon b. Shetach ruled that the husband should retain the sum specified in the Kethubah. In this manner the wife became a partner to all his possessions which served as her guarantee. Indirectly it also made it more difficult to obtain a divorce.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת י״ב ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Simeon b. Shetach also ruled that every father must engage a teacher for his children.

Once he bought a donkey from an Ishmaelite. When he brought his donkey home, his disciples found a diamond in a little bag tied around the animal’s neck. They said to their teacher: God’s blessing has made you rich. But Simeon answered: I only bought the animal but not the diamond.

                "Of their descent it is told that they were children or grandchildren of proselytes. But despite the fact that the position of the descendants of proselytes, even to the tenth generation, was not very favorable, they achieved the highest honors which Jews of that time could hope to attain. It is also necessary to remember that Shemaiah and Abtalion lived before the treason of the Idumeans and proselytes were therefore not viewed with suspicion.",
                "We also do not know who chose these two scholars to their positions and whether their election was peacefully accomplished. It is possible that the king of Judea, who surrounded himself with mercenaries to protect himself from his subjects, purposely chose descendants of proselytes to head the Sanhedrin in the hope that they would side with the Sadducees. However, if that was his intention he was mistaken, for although Shemaiah and Abtalion were peaceful people who did not meddle in politics, they faithfully clung to the Pharisees and did not make the least change in the system of interpreting the commandments of the Torah as it was established by the previous scholars.",
                "Shemaiah and Abtalion were influential during one of the unhappiest periods in Jewish history. Before her death, Salome, the widow of Alexander Jannai relinquished the throne to her son Jochanan Hyrcanus who was a peaceful retiring man. Jochanan’s brother, Aristobulus, did not approve of the arrangement and started a war against his brother which ended with a compromise. Aristobulus became king and Jochanan Hyrcanus assumed the High Priesthood. This arrangement may have proved to be lasting were it not for a friend of Hyrcanus, Antipater by name, who was a descendant of the forced Idumean converts, who were brought into the Jewish fold by Hyrcanus’ grandfather. Antipater sought to create discord between the two rulers. He tried to persuade Aristobulus that his brother was planning to regain the throne. But Aristobulus paid no heed to his accusation although there was some justification in it since Hyrcanus was the older of the two brothers and thus the rightful heir to the throne. Failing in this attempt, Antipater told Hyrcanus that Aristobulus wanted to be rid of him in order to unite the throne and the High Priest’s office in his person.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The names of the princes of the Hasmonean family were constantly repeated. This must be borne in mind when one comes across similar names.</i>",
                "Antipater suggested that it would be easier to carry on a war against his brother from outside the city and advised that Hyrcanus leave Jerusalem. Hyrcanus accepted this advice and together with a host of followers he left the city. Hyrcanus established an alliance with a neighboring Arab king who was told that Aristobulus wished to annex his land and he was. promised considerable compensation for his aid in the forthcoming war against Aristobulus.",
                "Reinforced by the Arab king, Hyrcanus besieged Jerusalem. This siege, however, was against the king only and not against the people and the besiegers decided to permit the daily sacrifice to be offered at the temple. Every day the priests within the city lowered a sum of money from the wall of the city and the besiegers hoisted up the animals required for the sacrifice.",
                "One of the besiegers, a man who spoke Greek, told the soldiers to hoist up pigs instead of the usual animals because it would be impossible to take the city as long as the daily sacrifices were properly conducted. It is unknown where they obtained pigs in Palestine, but this act shocked the whole people who fantastically embellished the consequences of this horrible mockery. It was told that when the pigs stuck their nails (!) into the walls of Jerusalem the whole countryside shook for four hundred miles. A tornado accompanied by an earthquake swept the land. Darkness covered the land during midday and in one moment all the grain on the fields surrounding Jerusalem wilted. When it was later necessary to bring the “Omer,” the first ripened sheaf, there was none found near Jerusalem and it was necessary to bring one from a long distance.",
                "The Sadducees had lost most of their influence by that time and when the inhabitants of the countryside about Jerusalem had to bring the Paschal lamb but could not enter the city, they went to offer this sacrifice in the temple of Onias in Alexandria.",
                "Jerusalem continued to withstand the siege. The besiegers could not take the fortress by storm and the besieged would not surrender. Both contending brothers then appealed to the Roman general Pompey, who happened to be near Palestine, to arbitrate between them. Pompey arrived in Jerusalem with a large army. He removed Aristobulus and executed many of his followers and he appointed Hyrcanus High Priest with the title of Ethnarch, ruler of the land as representative of Rome. To impress upon Hyrcanus still further that he was not an independent ruler, Pompey appointed Antipater as his assistant in the secular government of the land. Antipater thus became virtual ruler of the country and Hyrcanus had to be satisfied with the High Priesthood and the official title of Ethnarch.",
                "After the death of Aristobulus, his two sons Alexander and Antigonos continued the struggle against Hyrcanus to regain the country. They formed an alliance with the Persians and with their aid Antigonos, the younger son of Aristobulus, succeeded in defeating Hyrcanus and he led him as a captive to Babylonia. Antigonos maintained himself in Jerusalem for three years. At the end of that time, Herod, the son of Antipater, appeared with a large Roman army. Antigonos was overthrown as a rebel against the Romans and the throne was occupied by Herod who recalled Hyrcanus to the High Priesthood.",
                "These wars lasted for more than thirty years and caused endless suffering but scholarship and the learning of the Torah did not cease. For a short time the Sanhedrin were divided into five parts according to the division of Palestine under five governors. By means of this division the Romans wanted to weaken the power of the Sanhedrin; but as this attempt failed the Sanhedrin were again reunited in Jerusalem under the leadership of Shemaiah and Abtalion.",
                "There is a legend that Shemaiah and Abtalion were descendants of Sancherib, king of Assyria. They did not interfere with the political affairs of the country and it is possible that as descendants of converts they did not feel very keenly the national humiliation which the Jews had to withstand in their own country. As long as they were permitted to observe the Torah according to the interpretations of the Pharisees and the temple was not disturbed, they interested themselves but little with the political storms which were agitating the land.",
                "Two maxims of Shemaiah and Abtalion have come down to us. These sayings are not entirely clear and require some elucidation. Shemaiah said: Love work and hate mastery and do not mingle with the officials. Abtalion said: Wise men, take heed of your words lest you incur the guilt which is punished by exile and you shall be exiled to a place of evil water and the disciples that come after you will drink and die and the name of Heaven will be profaned.",
                "It is evident that both of the sayings referred to the events of the time. All those who sought to rule met with misfortune and many of the scholars had to seek refuge in Egypt where their disciples absorbed many new ideas which were opposed to those current in Palestine.",
                "Shemaiah and Abtalion sought to limit the number of students in their academy and instituted a fee of admission for some reason which has not been definitely established. Every one had to pay a half-penny to the gate keeper. This sum was considered quite large and at that time a person had to work half a day to earn it.",
                "Since the downfall of Aristobulus, there remained small detachments of his army which roamed in the Galilee and conducted a guerilla warfare against the Syrians and Romans. Herod tracked them down with great cruelty until he finally captured their leader, Hezekiah, and killed him together with some of his men. The populace was enraged against Herod and, with the consent of Hyrcanus, he was summoned to appear for trial before the Sanhedrin. Herod appeared not as a defendant but as a great commander dressed in purple and armed with a sword. He was surrounded by a large number of warriors, all armed, who were ready to attack anyone that should attempt to touch Herod. The Sanhedrin was displeased but out of fear its members maintained silence. Shemaiah warned them not to spare the defendant, for if they showed fear Herod would convict them at some future time. Encouraged by Shemaiah’s words they began to question Herod and the witnesses. However, when Hyrcanus saw that the Sanhedrin might convict Herod he suggested postponing the sentence till the following day. On that night Herod fled from Jerusalem.",
                "Later, when Herod became virtual ruler of the country, he remembered that the scholars dared to bring him to trial and he persecuted them. Many of them were killed but he spared Shemaiah and Abtalion. He was deeply impressed by Shemaiah’s courageous stand at that trial and he also feared to touch the most prominent Elders of the nation. He therefore waited until they died a natural death.",
                "All the wrongs which the Hasmoneans ever committed against their people, their persecution of the Pharisees, their civil wars, their immorality and imitation of the Greek code of morals, all of these were visited upon the Hasmonean family and upon the people during that terrible time when they suffered the yoke of Herod. For Herod the people had no other appelation than the “Idumean slave.” Secretly the people admitted that they deserved this punishment because they permitted the House of David to be exterminated and allowed the priests to become the rulers.",
                "Shemaiah and Abtalion exhibited their courage on still another occasion. Once, when the High Priest was returning home after the service of the Day of Atonement accompanied by the whole people, he met Shemaiah and Abtalion. The people thereupon left the High Priest to follow Shemaiah and Abtalion. Although he was angered, the High Priest said nothing at the moment. When Shemaiah and Abtalion later came up to greet him he said to them: “Let the children of the Gentiles go in peace.” This hint at their non-Jewish origin evoked the following response from Shemaiah and Abtalion: “Let the children of the Gentiles come in peace, for they do the deeds of Aaron who was a lover of peace, but let the son of Aaron not come in peace, for he does not follow in the ways of Aaron.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא ע״א ב׳.</span></i>"

He spared the two representatives of the Sanhedrin Shemaiah and Abtalion. Because of their advanced age he considered it wise to wait until they died. Not many years passed before both of them died a natural death.",
                "The years in which the two leaders died, and which of them passed away first we do not know. But we do know that for a considerable length of time after their death scholarship was on the decline. The people were preoccupied with the political situation which was desperate and whenever the Talmud refers to those days it hints that it was a period in which the Torah was being forgotten by the people. One virtue characterized the time that those who were ignorant revered those who possessed knowledge. In later years the situation changed to such an extent that people were ashamed of scholarship and the ignorant “Am Haaretz” was reckoned higher than a scholar.",

No mention is made of their descent but they probably were not related or they could not both have been members of the Sanhedrin. The city Bathyra, from which they came, was located in north eastern Palestine near Mount Hermon. It was founded as a fortress against the attacks of roving robber bands who wandered near the boundary.",
                "The Torah, as was stated above, was largely forgotten among the people but we may assume that here and there scholars were still to be found outside of Jerusalem. When Herod had to choose new leaders for the Sanhedrin he sought them among the scholars of the outlying districts in the conviction that men of the provinces would be loyal to him and would do his bidding.",
                "The men of Bathyra—it must be noted—were pious, God fearing and modest and endeavored with all their might to preserve the Jewish faith. They did not deviate from any of the ways of the Pharisees. Only once were they in doubt about the observance of a religious law. It happened that Passover eve fell on a Saturday and they did not know whether the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb superseded the Sabbath and should be offered as on a week day or whether the sacrifice should not be offered at all.",
                "They spent a long time seeking for a solution but they could not find it, neither was there anyone in Jerusalem who could inform them. They were ready to declare that since an ordinary feast day offering does not supersede the Sabbath, neither does the Paschal lamb offering. Then there came a man before them and said that in Jerusalem there lived a man named Hillel of Babylon who studied with Shemaiah and Abtalion and he would certainly know whether the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb supersedes the Sabbath. Hillel was summoned before them and he declared that the offering of the Paschal lamb does supersede the Sabbath. The men of Bathyra did not want to accept his opinion until he assured them that he received this law from Shemaiah and Abtalion. When they heard this they believed him and, being honestly ashamed of their ignorance, they publicly withdrew from their positions and declared that they were not worthy to retain them.",

Later, attempting to gain the confidence of the people, he married the Hasmonean princess Miriam who was the daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus and the grandson of king Alexander Jannai. On her mother’s side Miriam was a grand daughter of king Hyrcanus. All this time, while Herod was becoming firmly entrenched in the country and was annihilating the Hasmonean dynasty, Hyrcanus stayed in Babylonia. The Babylonian Jews promised to defend him loyally all his life. But Herod was dissatisfied with this state of affairs and by various wiles he succeeded in bringing Hyrcanus back to Palestine. Afterward he had Hyrcanus crippled through cutting off one of his ears in order to make him unfit for the priesthood. But even a crippled Hasmonean seemed too dangerous to Herod and he accused him of allying himself with the enemies of the country. He allowed Hyrcanus, who once saved Herod from the Sanhedrin, to be sentenced to death in spite of his great age. Hyrcanus was then 81 years old.",
                "Herod then chose Chanamel as High Priest. It was rumored that Chanamel was a descendant of Onias the son of Simeon the Just and Herod hoped to utilize this man for his political ambitions. But Herod was soon forced by circumstances to appoint as High Priest the only remaining Hasmonean, Aristobulus, the brother of his wife Miriam. He allowed Aristobulus to conduct the service in the temple once and then he invited him to visit Jericho with him. While they were bathing in the Jordan Aristobulus was drowned by one of Herod’s servants. Chanamel was reinstated to the high priesthood for a short time.",
                "Herod changed High Priests very frequently as his whim dictated. When some of the ambitious priests realized that the high priesthood was no longer an office to be inherited they outdid one another in the sums that they were ready to pay for the office. The people called these priests by various nick names because the office changed hands nearly every year and frequently the high priest did not maintain himself even for that length of time.",
                "We must keep in mind, however, that no matter how barbarous the behavior of Herod, he never tried to undermine the Jewish religion. Whenever he acted against the laws of the faith he did so because he felt that the religious commandments interfered with his political ambitions.",
                "No one, not even the nearest friends of the king, were certain of their lives. In previous years the Sadducees tried to do away with the Torah and some of the Hasmoneans aided them in this effort. But Herod did not try to interfere with the laws. He did not care whether Judaism developed along the lines laid out by the Pharisees nor would he have minded if the Sadducees had their way. But he annihilated everyone whom he suspected of opposition to himself, and in those days it was an easy matter to accomplish this. One command of Herod was sufficient to lead hundreds of men to execution. He thus did away with the Hasmoneans and later he executed his beloved wife, his mother in law and his own sons. Not in vain was it said in Rome that only a pig is safe in Herod’s house, because being a Jew he would not kill it."

But the appellation of circle drawer is unique in history and does not appear again in connection with any other name that has come down through the ages. The exact meaning of this appellation (in Hebrew: “Hamagel”) has not been determined. According to the book of geneology he was called Hamagel because he hailed from a city named Megilo. Others maintain that he received this name because, according to legend, he once slept for seventy years and they interpret Hamagel to mean—one who has rested on the way.

Trees and grass were withered and the people feared the famine that was bound to come. They then came to Choni the circle drawer with a request that he pray to God for rain. Because of Choni’s great piety every one felt convinced that his appeal for rain would not be denied by God and a request by him would be considered as a command.",

Choni addressed God again: Not for these few drops have I prayed. I prayed for a rain that should fill the wells with water. As he finished speaking a heavy rain accompanied by a storm began to descend and every drop of water was large enough to fill a barrel. His disciples again appealed to Choni: God is sending down a rain which will flood the world. Choni again appealed to God: Not for this have I prayed. I prayed for rain that should bring blessing to the fields.",

Some of the residents of those streets sought refuge on the temple mountain while others came to Choni with a new request, that just as he prayed for rain and it was granted even so he should now pray for the rain to cease. Choni asked them to see if the wanderer’s stone was already covered with water for as long as that stone was not submerged he could not ask that the rain cease. (The wanderer’s stone was a place where all lost articles were redeemed by their owners upon identification.)",
                "Later they brought an ox to be sacrificed to God that the rain might cease. Choni placed both hands on the offering and said: “Thy people Israel which you have redeemed from Egypt cannot bear too great a bounty even as they cannot bear too much punishment. When you were displeased with them they could not withstand your anger and besought me to intervene with you on their behalf. Now that you have bestowed upon them too much generosity they cannot bear this either. Therefore, Creator of the world, I beg of you to consider the rain that fell so far sufficient and to permit the world to breathe freely again.”",

His first attempt was to appoint the men of Bathyra to head the Sanhedrin but these voluntarily resigned in favor of Hillel of Babylonia. Herod was thus forced by circumstances to recognize the significance of Hillel and to tolerate his control of the religious life even as he previously was forced to spare the aged Shemaiah and Abtalion.",

                "When Hillel came to Palestine he was in his late thirties and already possessed much knowledge. He came to the country in order to clarify for himself three religious questions of which he was in doubt. These were: 1) Whether a man who underwent purification had to be declared pure by a priest or whether the procedure of purification was sufficient. 2) The disagreement between two texts of the Bible one of which says that the Paschal offering is to be made from sheep and cattle and the other states that the offering is to be selected from the sheep and the goats. 3) The contradiction between two texts one of which enjoins that Matzoth be eaten for six days and the other that they should be eaten for seven days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>",
                "He sought clarification on these questions from Shemaiah and Abtalion and was ready to return to Babylonia, where he lived in favorable circumstances. He had one brother who was a merchant and his other relatives undoubtedly also aided him. But his great desire for learning delayed his return and as time went by it still seemed to him that he did not know enough. He thus became estranged from his native country where Jews lived in peace and he was not frightened by the discord and political revolutions which agitated Palestine.",
                "The Babylonian Jews of that time were pious and God fearing people who observed all the regulations of Judaism in so far as that could be done outside of Palestine. They were especially strict in their observance of the Sabbath to its minutest details and they sent their “Shkolim” and sacrifices to Jerusalem. But there was a lack of colleges for the study of the Torah and the Babylonian Jews were therefore held in contempt by the Palestinian Jews for their ignorance. In addition both Babylonian and Palestinian Jews believed that only in Palestine could the religious regulations be correctly interpreted and any regulation which did not have the sanction of the Great Court of Jerusalem was not accepted by the people.",
                "While studying with Shemaiah and Abtalion, Hillel lived in straitened circumstances and earned his livelihood from hard labor. Altogether he earned but a small coin a day, half of which he spent for himself and his household and the other half he gave to the gate keeper of the academy. But one day he did not earn any money. Neither he nor his family ate on that day but, being anxious to hear the discourse of Shemaiah and Abtalion and not having the money to pay the gate keeper, Hillel climbed onto the roof of the academy and lay near the chimney where he could hear the discussion inside. All night he thus lay on the roof. This was in the month of Tebeth in midwinter and all that night it snowed and the snow covered his whole body to a great height.",
                "On the following morning the academy seemed darker than usual. The sky light was covered with snow, but when the people looked closer they saw the body of a man under the snow. They immediately went up and removed the snow and recognized the man as Hillel. They washed him and annointed his body with oil and warmed him before the fire. Although such work is prohibited on the Sabbath the scholars declared that a man like Hillel deserved that the Sabbath be desecrated for his sake.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא ל״ה ב׳.</span></i>",
                "All this time Hillel did not reveal his great knowledge. Besides Shemaiah and Abtalion no one knew him intimately, neither did he confide in anyone whether he and his household were in need.",
                "After the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion he apparently returned to Babylonia but he frequently visited Jerusalem whenever any doubt arose in his mind. Mostly he came before the feast days in observance of the commandment to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but he always kept in the background. Once, on the eve of Passover, which occurred on a Saturday, the men of Bathyra, who were the religious authorities, were in doubt whether the Paschal lamb offering should supersede the Sabbath or whether it should not be offered at all because of it. One of their pupils rose and said to them: “There is present a man from Babylonia who studied under Shemaiah and Abtalion; he will certainly know the law.” But the men of Bathyra nodded their heads as if to say: “What can one learn from a Babylonian?”",
                "Nevertheless they summoned Hillel and asked him what should be done. Hillel said: “Are you concerned about the Paschal lamb only when there are many other sacrifices offered on the Sabbath?” He expounded the rules of the Torah all day to prove that the Paschal lamb offering supersedes the Sabbath. Still they would not listen to him until he said that he received the law from Shemaiah and Abtalion.",
                "They then asked him: “What should be done if the people do not bring the slaughtering knives? For even if the offering of the sacrifice supersedes the Sabbath it still remains prohibited to carry any object on that day.” Hillel then replied: “I do not remember what Shemaiah and Abtalion taught in this matter but I am certain that the people will know the law, for whenever there is any doubt what to do one should observe the custom of the people and decide the law accordingly.”",
                "On the following day, Passover eve, it happened just as Hillel predicted. The people brought their sacrifices and had the slaughtering knives hidden in the wool of the lambs and among the horns of the goats. When Hillel saw this he remembered that Shemaiah and Abtalion instructed that it should be done so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים ס״ו א׳, ירושלמי פּסחים פרק וי הלכה א׳.</span></i>",
                "Hillel was the first of the authors of the Mishnah who insisted that the object of religion is to enforce the fulfillment of the duties of one man toward another and that all practical commandments are but a means to this end. He therefore established the principle of brotherly love as the main condition for all the commandments of the Torah. Once, when a Gentile wanted to adopt Judaism on one condition, that he be taught the whole Torah in the time that he could stand on one foot, Hillel gave him but one rule: Do not unto thy neighbor what you would not have him do unto you. This is the whole Jewish law, he said.

Hillel answered both of them satisfactorily and converted them.",
                "Probably the most interesting story concerns a man who wagered a large sum of money on angering Hillel. The man ran before Hillel’s house on a Friday, just as the time that Hillel was bathing in preparation for the Sabbath. In a loud voice he shouted: “Hillel, who is Hillel and where is he?” Hillel wrapped himself in a cloak and came out saying: “I am Hillel. What do you want, my son?”",

                "Hillel served as Nasi from 30 B.C. to 10 C.E. In the prevailing political situation of the country it was significant that Hillel was a descendant of king David. (His mother was descended from Shefatia, the son of David.) The people considered him a scion of the royal house of David and accorded him appropriate honors. While everyone looked upon Herod as a tyrant whose only aim was to collect taxes for the foreign rulers and to protect the boundaries of the land, they revered Hillel as a religious leader and obeyed his every word. It was then that the benediction of the House of David, ending with the words, “He raises a ray of hope,” was introduced into the daily prayers (Shmoneh Esrei) and it is possible that the people looked upon Hillel’s exalted position as a beginning of the restoraion of the House of David. This was also the cause for the introduction of still another benediction, to be recited on Saturday after the reading of the prophets, which began with the words: “Gladden us, oh Lord, with the prophet Elijah, your servant, and with the kingdom of David your anointed” and ended with: “On his throne a stranger shall not sit nor shall others inherit his honor.”",
                "From Hillel were descended three generations of N’siim who governed religious life for one hundred years. For the outside world Herod and his successors were the sovereigns of the country but the internal life of the nation, which concentrated about the faith, was guided by Hillel’s heirs.",
                "Herod no doubt knew of the honor which was being accorded to Hillel and that he was looked upon as a successor of David, But in his political sagacity he realized that Hillel would constitute a real danger only if he claimed to be a descendant of the Hasmoneans.",
                "In later generations Hillel’s importance was compared to that of Ezra. It was said that Ezra renewed the Torah after it was forgotten by the people and similarly Hillel came out of Babylonia and taught the Torah which was neglected after the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion.",
                "The Talmud relates: Eighty of the most important men of the generation were pupils of Hillel. Thirty of these were worthy enough to have the “Shechinah” rest upon them even as it rested upon Moses. Another thirty were deserving to have the sun stop in its course for their sake even as it did for Joshua b. Nun. The remaining twenty were intermediate men and among them were such as Jonathan b.

Once, as he was approaching his house, he heard shouts coming from that direction and he said to his disciples who were accompanying him to his home: “I am certain that these quarrel-some shouts do not come from my home.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ס׳ א׳.</span></i>",

                "One of his maxims stated: “Wherever my heart loves, there my feet lead me; if you will come to me then will I also come to you, but if you do not come to me neither can I come to you.” This maxim has been interpreted in many ways and many people found in it that which they sought.",

But he particularly insisted that man is obliged to perfect his spiritual self, for if a man does not do so himself no one will do it for him. To this he added that one man for himself counts for little and he must also have the assistance of others, and he stressed the importance of the present moment in one’s life, for if not now, when?",
                "Hillel firmly believed that there was no unjust suffering and even when it seemed that divine justice was wrong one must bear in mind that all one’s deeds are reckoned and that one receives his punishment at the hands of another sinful creature. Once he saw a head floating upon the water. It was a time of many murders; Herod frequently allowed many people to be executed and had their bodies thrown into the water. Hillel believed that if those people had not deserved it, God would not have permitted their being killed but, at the same time, he was convinced that the murderers would also meet their punishment. He therefore addressed the floating head: “You drowned others and therefore you were drowned; but in the end your assassins will also be drowned.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סוכה נ״ג א׳.</span></i>",

Hillel expressed his opinions peacefully and when he tried to prove the truth of his statements he did so in a calm manner. He said that man must love peace and search for it. When one attains the state of love for his fellow man he brings other people closer to the Torah.",
                "Although Hillel was devoted to the traditions of the “oral law,” he did not attack those who doubted them. He never drove the doubters from himself, as others did, but merely sought to convince them that it was impossible to observe the written law without recognizing the validity of the oral law. Once a heathen came to him saying that he wanted to embrace Judaism on condition that he learn the written law only. Hillel accepted him and then he showed him that it was impossible to study anything without accepting the opinions of one’s teacher. The proselyte understood that since he had to believe Hillel he also had to accept Hillel’s belief that the written law cannot be explained without the aid of the oral law.",

                "So far as we know, Hillel was the first of the Tanaim to establish a system of expounding the laws of the Torah that was based on rules of logic or “measures according to which the Torah was expounded,” as they were called in the Talmud. There were seven rules defined by Hillel.",
                "We may assume that Hillel did not invent these seven rules (or measures) without a definite foundation. These rules were employed before him.

Sometimes, however, it may also be used to limit the restrictions of a doubtful commandment.",

Hillel came to the conclusion that since in the case of the cure of a “Nethek” the Bible states “he is clean,” which is a generalization, which statement is later followed by the words “the priest shall purify him,” which is a specification, it is impossible to understand the generalization without the specification.

                "If this account is true, then it is possible that Herod persuaded Menachem that his life and career will be safer if he leaves the temple and engages in royal srvice. Menachem was convinced and he was succeeded by Shammai. It is also unknown how long Menachem collaborated with Hillel; but this relationship must have been of short duration since he left no impression and no words of his are mentioned anywhere.",
                "The Talmud characterized Shammai as an angry man in contradistinction to Hillel who was noted for his modesty and patience.",
                "Every non-Jew who wanted to embrace Judaism on certain conditions, and whom Hillel did convert, first visited Shammai. But Shammai was angered with them because of the conditions which they imposed, and in one case the dispute developed into a physical struggle. But this tendency to anger on the part of Shammai must not be interpreted as a sign of an evil nature, for whenever he realized that his opponent was right he gladly conceded it. Shammai once had a dispute with Jonathan b. Uziel, a disciple of Hillel, who did not spare Shammai in the course of the debate. When Shammai became convinced of the justice of Jonathan’s arguments, he conceded his defeat and only complained of the insults which his opponent heaped upon him.",
                "The best indication of Shammai’s character is contained in his advice that every man should be received in a friendly manner. But some historians interpret this as an attempt to rid others of that weakness from which he could not rid himself.",
                "Shammai studied under Shemaiah and Abtalion together with Hillel. But it appears that he headed an academy soon after the death of Shemaiah and Abtalion and before Hillel started an academy of his own. Whenever the two academies (the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel) are mentioned in the Talmud, the “House of Shammai” is usually listed first,",
                "Shammai was very extreme in his piety. He held the Sabbath to be the most important day of the week in anticipation of which every Jew must prepare even as one would prepare for the reception of a prince. Beginning on Sunday, he would therefore search for the best things and reserve them for the Sabbath. He never permitted good food to be served at his table on a week day unless he had better food prepared for the Sabbath.",
                "It was accepted at that time that children should not fast on the Day of Atonement. It was customary for fathers to wash one hand on that day in order to offer food for their children. But Shammai refused to do this because of the prohibition against washing on the Day of Atonement and permitted his small child to fast. When other scholars realized that the child’s life was in danger they forced Shammai to feed the child with both hands. It also happened that Shammai’s daughter-in-law gave birth to a son on Succoth. Shammai thereupon removed the roof of the house and covered the balcony overhanging the mother’s bed with green branches so that the new-born son may not be outside of a succah.",
                "It is apparent from Shammai’s behavior that he was careful to observe all the minutae of the commandments. It is also evident that he did not interfere with the political situation in the country and devoted himself solely to the interpretation of the laws in which he was seldom in agreement with Hillel. Hillel sought broader vistas in his exposition while Shammai clung to the literal meaning of the text even in those cases where logic indicated that it should be interpreted otherwise. Hillel sought the causes underlying the laws and critically analyzed previous interpretations before he arrived at his own conclusions.",
                "In time these differences between the disciples of Hillel and Shammai increased and it seemed as if there were two Torahs instead of one, for the claims of one school were invariably contradicted by the other. This opposition reached such a state that on one occasion all the people were prohibited from leaving the academy on pain of death until a decision would be made whether Hillel or Shammai was the correct exponent of the law. “This day,” the Talmud states “was as difficult as the day on which the golden calf was made.” The Talmud makes no mention of the results of that day but on another occasion it relates that after many years of dispute a “voice” announced that both contending sides are correct but the law is according to the teaching of Hillel. It is told that one of the later Tanaim (Rabbi Tarphon) repeated the Shema in the manner that Shammai prescribed and soon after that he was beset by robbers. The scholars thereupon told him that he deserved to be in that danger because he deviated from the law of Hillel.",
                "Most of the differences of opinion between the two schools centered about the laws pertaining to sacrifices, tithes and the rules of purity. Some sharp clashes also arose in problems of marriage which one school permitted and the other school prohibited. It might have been expected that differences of opinion on this subject would lead to accusations of illegitimate birth. But this was not the case since both schools were tolerant toward each other and their disciples intermarried freely.",
                "But in spite of the strictness of Shammai he nevertheless had the interests of the people at heart. Whenever he realized that it was impossible to enforce a certain stricture he overlooked it and advised waiting for a more favorable time to introduce it.",
                "The laws pertaining to the Sabbatical year were frequently ignored at that time. While no one sowed his fields on that year, in accord with the literal meaning of the Torah, many people nevertheless permitted themselves to plow their fields in anticipation of next year’s planting because the law does not explicitly prohibit plowing. This procedure was similar to that of preparing food on a holy day for consumption on a week day and many people expected Shammai to prohibit it. But Shammai said: “If the times were to permit it I would decree against the sowing of fields which were plowed on the Sabbatical year.”",
                "From these words of Shammai it is evident that the reason why he refrained from issuing such a decree was the fact that Herod did not allow interference with the farmers because of the income which he derived from them. Were it in his power, Herod would have abolished the Sabbatical year but he feared to tamper with a law that was commanded by the Torah. He limited himself to forcing the scholars to issue such decrees regarding the cultivation of fields on the Sabbatical year as would least interfere with the work.",
                "One of the main differences between Hillel and Shammai involved the question of “Semichah,” the placing of hands on a sacrifice. The Torah commands a man “to rest his hand” on the sacrifice which he offers, and this was interpreted to indicate that the penitent must participate in the slaughtering of the sacrifice. Since such a procedure involves a considerable effort a dispute arose as to whether one has to do so on feast days and on the Sabbath. One school absolved the penitent from this procedure while the other maintained that without it the sacrifice was not valid.",
                "Shammai and Hillel founded two schools of interpreting the Torah according to which they decided all religious problems. While basing themselves on the same texts and on the same traditions which they inherited from Shemaiah and Abtalion they nevertheless arrived at contradictory conclusions in nearly every case.",
                "Up to the time of Hillel and Shammai all disputes carried a party character. The opposing sides—the Sadducees and the Pharisees—held differing points of view and everyone could readily understand the origin of the disputes. With Hillel and Shammai the disputes assumed an inner party nature. This was a new phenomenon since both of them belonged to the Pharisees in whose ranks peace prevailed until that time. Only in the matter of “Semichah” was there any difference of opinion; complete unity was the rule in all other questions. It is therefore surprising that the disputes between Hillel and Shammai developed in intensity until the abyss between them became ever greater and more ominous.",
                "Hillel, as was related previously, had eighty disciples. Thirty of these were deserving to have the “Schechinah” rest upon them even as it rested on Moses. Thirty deserved to have the sun stop in its course for their sake just as it did for Joshua. Twenty were intermediate men. The least of Hillel’s disciples was Rabbi Jochanan b. Zakkai of whom it was said that “he was familiar with all the nooks of the Torah, the Mishna, the Gemara, the Halachot and Agadot and the minutest interpretations of the Torah and of the Soferim. He understood all the mysteries of “Gematrio” (numerical evaluation), the language of the angels and of the evil spirits, the language of the palm trees as well as many fables of apes and foxes.” When the Talmud lists the praises of the disciples of Hillel it is with the intention of showing what a learned man the greatest of them must have been if the least of them, Rabbi Jochanan b. Zakkai, was so well versed.",
                "The names of two of Shammai’s outstanding disciples have come down through history, and of them it is told that in spite of their training in the school of Shammai they believed that all laws should be observed according to Hillel’s interpretation. One of these was Rabbi Jochanan of Hauran and the other was Baba b. Buta.",
                "Baba b. Buta was blinded by Herod during the latter’s extermination of the sages. Later Herod repented and asked Baba b. Buta, what he could do to atone for his misdeed. Baba b. Buta is described as being a pious man who daily offered a sacrifice to atone for any possible sin that he may have committed.",
                "In connection with the name of Baba b. Buta a story is told of a man from Babylon who settled in Jerusalem and married there. But the language of the Jews of Babylon was different from that of the Jews of Palestine, despite the fact that they all spoke an Aramaic dialect, and the wife of this man could therefore not understand what he was saying. Once he commanded her to bring him “two butsinis”, when he meant to ask for two water melons, and she brought two candles instead. (The word <span dir=\"rtl\">״בוציני״</span> meant water melons in Babylonian and candles in the Palestinian dialects.) Angered at her misunderstanding, the man commanded his wife to “go break them on the doorstep.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">זיל תברי יתהון על רישא דבבא.</span></i> This was a customary remark in Babylonia, when one was brought something he did not want. The woman believed she was told to break the candles on Baba’s head and did so. (“Resha d’baba” means the head of the door and also the head of Baba.) Baba was not angered and merely asked her why she did that. The woman told him that she was commanded to do so by her husband, whereupon Baba said to her: “Because you obeyed the will of your husband God will give you two sons who will be like Baba b. Buta.”",
                "The differences of opinion between the “House of Shammai” and the “House of Hillel” lasted until the destruction of the temple. After its destruction the name of the “House of Shammai” practically disappeared. According to the Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין י״ג בי.</span></i> this dispute continued till the days of Rabbi Gamaliel of Jabneh who was five generations removed from Hillel. He convoked all the scholars of his time to Jabneh and there they decided by vote whether the opinions of the school of Shammai or those of the school of Hillel should be enforced. The debate lasted three years until a “Bath-kol” (a divine voice) announced, that the opinions of both schools are from God but that the law is according to Hillel.",
                "The disciples of the school of Hillel endeavored to lighten the burden of the law in imitation of the ways of Hillel who was the personification of modesty and kindliness. In many instances they sought to find better ways for man to follow. It was customary at that time to dance before the bride during the wedding and to praise her virtues in order that the bridegroom may appreciate her qualities. Hillel insisted that a bride should be praised for her beauty even when she was not beautiful in the same manner that one praises an article which another bought even when one realizes that it was not a good buy.",
                "The school of Hillel paid particular attention to the moral and spiritual consequences of every law. The law of that time said that a girl who was married before she was of age could not reject her husband after she became of age. But the school of Hillel maintained that if the girl was an orphan and was married off by her mother or brother, she could reject the husband that was chosen for her before she was old enough to choose for herself.",
                "Similarly in the matter of “Yibum,” in the case of a man who dies childless, the man’s brother has to marry the widow. If he refuses to do so he has to grant her “chalitzah.” In such a case the widow had no choice. The school of Hillel tried to modify this law to allow for cases where the widow refuses to marry her deceased husband’s brother. They ruled that if the woman claims to have taken a vow during her husband’s lifetime never to have any dealings with her husband’s brother, then the court must force him to release her from his claim although legally her argument remains that he refuses to marry her. If the widow took such a vow after her husband’s death, then the court should request the brother of the dead man to forego his right and to grant “chalitzah” to the woman.",
                "The school of Hillel modified the law permitting divorce in a similar fashion. The school of Shammai allowed the granting of a divorce only on the grounds of the wife’s infidelity. Any other complaint of the husband about the physical or spiritual unfitness of the wife was considered insufficient ground for divorce. The school of Shammai held the bond of matrimony to be sanctified by divine powers and no human agency could release it except by express command of the Torah. But the school of Hillel maintained that the morals of society and the happiness of humanity would be improved if man were allowed to divorce his wife for any undesirable traits which he may find in her.",
                "The school of Shammai never deviated from the literal meaning of the text of a commandment while the school of Hillel always studied the possible intentions of the text first and only later did they issue their edict according to reason and for the betterment of humanity. For these reasons the school of Shammai always decreed the law in its severest interpretation while the school of Hillel tended to lighten the burden whenever possible.",
                "The political situation of the Jews of Palestine was a very difficult one. The country was in constant turmoil due to the foreign and civil wars. But the greatest calamity occurred when the country lost its independence and became a Roman province under the rule of a governor who could dictate the material as well as the spiritual life of the country. There then developed a party of patriots which openly or secretly opposed Rome. This party inscribed in its program that God is the sole ruler of the Jews and they said: “Woe to the nation which chooses a man to rule over it.”",
                "Historians claim that this party consisted primarily of the followers of the school of Shammai. The followers of Hillel were also dissatisfied with the political situation but they did not believe in revolutionary propaganda and they attacked the enemy by means of laws against those people who aided the Romans in collecting taxes from the Jews. They held that it is difficult for “Gabaim” (treasurers) and “Mochesim” (tax collectors) to repent their sins because they are like robbers and it was forbidden to receive from them any contribution for charitable purposes. Despite all this, the followers of Hillel accepted their fate realizing that there was no force which could avail against Rome.",
                "The attitude of the followers of Shammai was entirely different. These openly opposed the Romans. At a gathering held in the house of Chananiah b. Ezekiah eighteen political questions were debated and the opinions of the followers of Shammai prevailed. But these decisions were not written down and in later years it became impossible to determine what they were.",
                "We must bear in mind that the followers of Shammai were revolutionaries and this meeting probably took place during the days of Agrippa the first when the patriots were preparing for a struggle with Rome. Fearing that the Romans may attack this meeting they arranged it so that it should be possible to claim, in case of attack, that it was not a political meeting but merely a gathering to discuss religious questions."

            "Akabia ben Mahalalel": [
                "N<small>UMEROUS INDICATIONS</small> in the Talmud suggest that during the life time of Hillel and Shammai there lived other spiritual leaders who followed an individual method in interpreting the Torah and who did not identify themselves with either of the above. Some of these are mentioned by name on a number of unimportant occasions. Others did not even attain this recognition.",
                "Akabia ben Mahalalel was one of the scholars who developed an individual method of exposition. We possess but vague knowledge of his life and activities. One report states that he was excommunicated without naming the sin for which he was thus punished. But this report is immediately contradicted and it is said that whoever invented such a slanderous rumor about a saintly man such as Akabia was, deserves severe punishment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">עדיות פרק ה׳ משנה ו׳.</span></i>",
                "Considering all references to Akabia ben Mahalalel in the Talmud one must conclude that he was an unusual man who was gifted by nature with great perseverance. The nation was then engaged in a great struggle to preserve its independence against outside enemies and was rent by an internal conflict over the observance of the Torah. In such a time Akabia ben Mahalalel succeeded in remaining above the inner and outer struggles and in maintaining his neutrality toward the contending sides.",
                "So far as we know, Akabia ben Mahalalel did not hold any official position. In religious questions he contributed his opinion on only four subjects which are of such rare occurrence that a century may pass before such problems present themselves again. Since his point of view differed from that of the other scholars and he expressed his opinions with a certain disrespect for the leaders of a previous generation he was therefore excommunicated.",
                "The original source of the four laws on which Akabia ben Mahalalel held dissenting views we find in the above mentioned Mishna. One dealt with special cases of leprosy, the other law concerned a woman who has an issue of blood, the third dealt with the wool shed by a clean first-born animal that was crippled, and the fourth concerned a woman suspected of infidelity who was a proselyte or a freed woman.",
                "The first two laws come under the category of legislation pertaining to cleanliness and impurity and their interpretation involves medical considerations. We will, however, devote a few words to the third and fourth laws.",
                "The first born of a clean animal had to be sacrificed in Jerusalem according to the prescribed custom for minor holy offerings (<span dir=\"rtl\">קדשים קלים</span>).\tAs long as such animal lived, one was not allowed to put it to work nor to shear its wool. In case such an animal became crippled it had to be slaughtered and given to a priest. As stated above, it was prohibited to shear the wool of such a first born animal, nor could the wool be utilized after it was slaughtered. But Akabia ruled that the priest was entitled to the use of that wool which the animal shed while it was still alive, while the other scholars disagreed with him.",
                "The fourth law about which Akabia held a dissenting opinion concerned a “Sotah”. (Sotah is a woman who is suspected by her husband of infidelity.) The prescribed procedure in such a case was for the husband to bring the wife together with an offering of barley meal to the priest. The priest took a clay vessel filled with pure water and placed in it some earth from the temple; he then wrote the verses of the Torah pertaining to a Sotah on a paper and read them to the woman after which he washed the ink from the paper with the water which he gave to the woman to drink. If the water caused the woman no harm it was held as proof that she was innocent.",
                "Akabia held that this procedure need not be applied to a Sotah who was a proselyte or a freed servant. In attempting to dissuade him, the scholars cited the case of Shemaiah and Abtalion who gave the water to a Sotah who was a freed servant. Akabia retorted that “they gave it to one like themselves.”",
                "The exact meaning of the words of Akabia is not clear. (The Hebrew word “dugma” means similar.) They are interpreted to indicate that Akabia was of the opinion that Shemaiah and Abtalion did not give the woman the prescribed water to drink nor did they write the prescribed passage. They merely attempted to influence her psychologically in order to obtain the truth. But some scholars thought these words to be a slurring reference to the origin of Shemaiah and Abtalion and they placed him under the ban. When Akabia died the people stoned his casket.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This story of the Sotah who was a freed woman is also related in Berachoth, 19. In commenting on it, Rashi states that when Akabia said <span dir=\"rtl\">״דוגמא השקוה״</span> he referred to the fact that Shemaiah and Abtalion were proselytes and they therefore considered the freed servant equal to a Jewish woman and did give her the prescribed water.</i>",
                "But the statement of one, Rabbi Jehudah, elsewhere referred to as Rabbi Jehudah of Bathyra, is immediately quoted to the effect that one must not believe that a just man like Akabia could have been put under the ban, nor could he have slandered the names of Shemaiah and Abtalion in the case of the freed servant. Whoever assumes that Akabia was excommunicated is deserving of punishment. Rabbi Jehudah maintains that the matter of the excommunication crept in through an error and involved another person named Elazar ben Chanoch who was put under the ban because he ignored the commandment of “washing hands” in the belief that this commandment was not implied in the Torah.",
                "The respect in which Akabia was held by the Jews can be seen from the fact that he was offered the position of the head of the Court if he would recall his decisions in the matter of the four above mentioned laws. But Akabia answered: “I would rather be called a fool all the days of my life than be wicked in the eyes of God for one hour or that people should point at me and say that I betrayed my convictions in order to obtain an office.”",
                "These four laws concerned subjects so rare that a court may have had no occasion to pass on them throughout its existence. We also find that later scholars held the same opinions as Akabia held.",
                "We must also bear in mind that immorality was very widespread in the Judea of that day and the whole procedure of trial of a woman suspected of infidelity was done away with. The Biblical text, “the woman shall be a curse within her people,” was interpreted to apply only in case the people lead moral lives.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i> There is therefore some doubt whether Akabia passed on these questions or whether his decisions caused any serious opposition.",
                "Before Akabia died he instructed his son not to observe these four laws according to his interpretation.",
                "His son asked him: “Why then did you not recall your decisions?” Akabia answered: “I have heard them adopted by a majority and my opponents heard their views adopted by a majority. For this reason I clung to the law as I heard it and they observed it as they received it. But you heard the decisions from me, who am but one, and from my opponents who are many. It is therefore better that you give up the opinions of the individual and abide by the opinions of the majority.”",
                "On this occasion Akabia’s son also asked his father to instruct his colleagues that they should treat him better, but Akabia answered that he would not speak to them about this matter. His son then asked him: “Have you found any evil in me?” The father answered: “I have seen no evil in you but I believe that intercession will not help you. Your own deeds will make you beloved among people and your own deeds will make them stay away from you.”",
                "The editor of the Mishna in “Pirke Aboth” cites the following maxim in the name of Akabia ben Mahalalel: “Keep in view three things and you will not come to sin.” Expounders interpreted these to be that a man should refrain from pride and sinful desires. Akabia stated further, “Know whence you came, whither you go and before whom you have to give strict account. Consider how you came into the world, remember that you are bound for a place of dust and worms and that you will have to give account before the king of kings, the Holy one blest be He.”",
                "In a somewhat different form we find this passage quoted in “Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan”: “Akabia ben Mahalalel said: ‘He who ponders the following four subjects will sin no more. Think of whence you come, whither you are going, what will become of you, and who will be your judge. Whence you come? From a place of darkness. Whither you are going? To a place of darkness. What will become of you? Dust and worms. Who will be your judge? The king of kings, the Holy one blest be He.’”",
                "Some people claim that the request to Akabia to recall his four opinions did not refer to the above described decisions concerning cleanliness and impurity, the wool of a first born crippled animal and a Sotah who was a proselyte but rather to those four maxims which he held that a man must take to heart in order to be saved from sin. These teachings placed Akabia in the category of one who spreads ideas that are dangerous for the world. By having people think constantly of death and of the sufferings in their grave, their desire to live is undermined.",
                "It was then that he was called upon to revoke the four maxims which deprive people of the desire to live and he would be appointed head of the court. However, it is difficult to explain how it could happen that a man who was under the ban for following an original system of interpreting the law should be considered a desirable candidate to head the Court.",
                "But this explanation is not based in fact, for it seems evident that Akabia was excommunicated, despite the denial of Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra. In the Talmud we find a passage of a later date which seriously poses the question why Akabia was not executed, as was the law regarding a “dissenting elder,” if he really ridiculed Shemaiah and Abtalion. The answer given to this question was that Akabia’s words regarding a Sotah who was also a freed woman had only a theoretical implication and were not meant to be taken as a law to be practiced.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין פּ״ח א׳.</span></i>",
                "The time of Akabia’s life has not been definitely established. It is certain that he lived after the death of Shammai in whose stead he was to be appointed as head of the court. When Akabia refused this office, it was thenceforth abolished."

            "Rabbi Gamliel the Elder": [
                "H<small>ILLEL WAS SUCCEEDED AS</small> N<small>ASI</small> of the Sanhedrin by his son Simeon. The office of Nasi assumed added importance after the office of “Head of the Court” was abolished and the Nasi became the sole ruler in all religious questions.",
                "But it seems that Simeon did not live very long. He is only mentioned in the Talmud as Hillel’s successor and no teaching of his has been recorded. When Simeon died his son Gamliel was elected Nasi. Gamliel came to be known as Rabban Gamliel the Elder and he was the first one to be titled “Rabban.”",
                "The title “Elder” was conferred upon Gamliel because he was the first scholar of that name. The title Rabban (our teacher) was conferred on him because he was the only Head of the Sanhedrin. At that time there was introduced the custom of “Smichat Z’kenim,” ordination of the elders, during which the Nasi or his representative ordained one of the disciples by placing his hand on his head. This procedure conferred upon the disciple the title Rabbi and the right to judge in all disputes except those involving life and death which were then the prerogative of the Roman government.",
                "Most of the time that Rabban Gamliel served as Nasi was unfavorable for the Jews, only one short period of improvement intervened. These were the last years preceding the destruction of the temple and the country was in a state of constant crisis. Officially the land was a province of the Roman empire and was ruled by the iron hand of a Roman governor. Even the slightest disobedience to the governor’s will was punishable by death.",
                "In those days Christianity began to spread in the country. The Apostle Paul (Saul of Tarsus) claims to have been a disciple of Rabban Gamliel. If this claim is justified, then the trial of Jesus must have taken place during those years.",
                "During that time too the Sanhedrin left the stone chamber in the temple and moved to “Chanuth,” a place in Jerusalem outside of the temple. The cause of this transfer of the Sanhedrin probably lay in the realization that the political situation of the country was rapidly approaching a crisis. If the temple could not withstand the enemy, it was aimed to save the Sanhedrin at least.",
                "Almost at the same time the throne of Rome was ascended by the mad Ceasar Caligula who demanded that all the nations of the empire accord him divine worship. He also commanded the Jews of Palestine to place his image in the temple.",
                "This command was received on the eve of the festival of Succoth when Jews from the whole country were gathered in Jerusalem for the festivities. Their joy immediately turned to mourning and every one felt certain that the royal decree would not be fulfilled for the whole nation would rise against the attempt to desecrate their sanctuary. Under the prevailing political situation it was obvious that such a rebellion against the emperor’s command would cost the lives of tens of thousands of people.",
                "One of the scholars then present in Jerusalem addressed the people and said: “Let not the festivities of this day be disturbed. God in Heaven will save us from Caligula’s decree even as he delivered us from other such decrees in the past.”",
                "His prediction came true and before this decree was executed Caligula was slain. With the death of the emperor this decree was abolished. Another political factor was influential in this case although its influence was exerted secretly.",
                "The Jewish prince Agrippa, the son of the executed prince Aristobulus who was the son of Miriam the Hasmonean, was educated in Rome where he was very friendly with Caligula. He once exclaimed that he wished emperor Tiberius was dead so that Caligula could ascend the throne. When this remark was reported to Tiberius he had Agrippa put in prison. A short time later Tiberius died and Caligula freed Agrippa from his imprisonment. In spite of the intrigues of his sister, who was also a grandchild of Miriam the Hasmonean, Agrippa was made ruler over several districts of the old Jewish kingdom. In addition to this Caligula offered to fulfill any wish of Agrippa which lay in his power. Agrippa asked that the decree to have an image of the emperor installed in the temple be revoked. Although Caligula was displeased by this request, he agreed to postpone the execution of his decree; meantime he was assassinated.",
                "After Caligula’s death, Agrippa utilized his influence with the Roman senate to have Claudius named emperor and Claudius showed his gratitude by naming Agrippa king over the whole land of Judea. Agrippa ruled for seven years which marked a bright period in the life of the Jews of Palestine.",
                "In contradistinction to his predecessors, Agrippa strove to observe all the laws of the Torah in the same manner as they were observed by the common people without requesting any royal privileges. But despite this there were many who were dissatisfied with the king. The behavior of previous kings was fresh in the memory of the people and many Jews felt that it would be better if there were no king.",
                "One of the scholars said to the king that he was not worthy to cross the threshold of the temple because he built a “theater” in Cesarea according to Roman custom. Agrippa did not punish the man but had him taken to a performance in Cesarea to convince him that the performances were not against the Jewish faith. Another time the king was accused of not being a full blooded Jew, since his grandfather (Herod) was an Idumean convert, and also of not being raised in the Jewish faith.",
                "Once when king Agrippa was standing on the platform in the temple during the festival of Succoth and was reading the king’s portion of the Torah (Deut. 17) he reached the verse “you shall not make a stranger who is not your brother king over you.” He then remembered the accusation that was levelled against him that he was not a pure Jew and he began to weep. The scholars felt a great pity for their weeping king and they said to him: “Fear not king Agrippa, you are our brother.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סוטה מ״א א׳.</span></i>",

                "Many of the king’s regulations aimed to make peace between the Jews and non-Jews. The Roman administration attracted many non-Jews to Palestine and these considered themselves privileged citizens because they enjoyed the direct protection of Rome. The Jews, on the other hand, believed themselves to be the more privileged because of their being natives of the land. Agrippa endeavored to establish friendly relations between the two and in this Rabban Gamliel aided him. It was then that they permitted the non-Jewish poor to come to glean the fields together with the Jewish poor, and they ruled that it was obligatory to give charity to Gentile and Jewish poor alike. Similar rites were prescribed for the dead of both peoples.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין ס״א א׳.</span></i>",

During the last days of his life he tried to ascertain the number of men that the Jews could raise into an army. He convoked all the Jews of the country to Jerusalem for a census. The census was made by means of the Paschal offerings which they brought. The High Priest hid a part of every offering and the number was found to be six hundred thousand. This was proof that there were six hundred thousand families in Palestine aside from those who could not come to Jerusalem because they were impure or because of the distance. Since every family consisted of an average of ten people it was accounted that the Jewish population of the country numbered over six million people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים ס״ד א׳, תוספתא פּסחים פרק ד׳.</span></i>",

                "Of the innovations of Rabban Gamliel there were some of great importance for his time. He introduced a new procedure in taking testimony regarding the beginning of a new month. When it was necessary to hear such testimony on a Sabbath, the witnesses were kept in a place called “Beth Yazek” and they were not permitted to leave the place all day because of the Biblical prohibition that “no man shall leave his place.” Rabban Gamliel amended this law to permit one to walk two thousand ells in every direction from the point at which one found himself. He permitted a similar liberty for midwives on their way to women in labor, in case of fire, attack by a foreign army and flood.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ראש השנה כ״ג ב׳.</span></i>",

But as the cases of violent death increased as a result of executions by the Romans as well as through murder on the highways Rabban Gamliel ruled that just as only one witness was required to validate a marriage even so only the testimony of one witness to the death of a man should be sufficient to permit the widow to remarry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יבמות קכ״ב א׳.</span></i>",
                "Aside from these innovations Rabban Gamliel introduced other rules pertaining to divorces and other important occasions in the lives of the people. In all of these regulations he aimed to lighten the burden of the laws. Only in those laws which pertained to cleanliness was he more severe than his predecessors. He also introduced various customs which placed the Nasi in a privileged position as compared to that of the common people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שקלים פרק ג׳ ופרק ו׳.</span></i>",

A disciple who comes from poor parents and who, although he has studied Torah, Mishnah, Halacha and Hagada, has no native intelligence is like an unclean fish. A disciple who comes from wealthy parents, has studied Torah, Mishna, Halacha and Hagada, and also has native intelligence is like a clean fish. One who has studied Torah and Mishna and can also expound Halacha and Hagada but is not intelligent enough to solve problems that are put before him is like a fish from the Jordan. Like a fish from the great sea is a disciple who has studied Torah and Mishna and can also expound Halacha and Hagada and can solve all problems put up to him.”",
                "From Rabban Gamliel we discover for the first time why the Sanhedrin declared some years to contain thirteen months. In a letter which he sent to the Jews of Palestine and the neighboring countries he said: “The time of Pesach is drawing nigh but there is no sign of spring and we will not have lambs for the Passover offering nor young pigeons to be sacrificed by women who have given birth nor will there be new barley for the offering of the sheaf.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין י״א ב׳, ירושלמי מעשרות פרק ה׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>",

He would have liked to continue the tradition of his forefather Hillel as a seeker after peace but it became impossible to witness the barbarities of the Roman rulers and to maintain one’s peace and even less so to attempt to pacify the people.",

The great gathering of scholars which took place in the home of Hanania ben Hezekia, which was mentioned before, took place in his time. Fearing that the Romans would attack the gathering they prepared a number of religious questions which had to be clarified in order to be able to say that this was not a political meeting but only a religious disputation.",

He also believed that the religious burden imposed upon the people should not be greater than that which they were willing to accept.",

Raised in luxury and reverence he was certain to have become an enthusiast of beauty and it is hard to evaluate how much of the “beauty of Japheth” he might have introduced into the “tents of Shem.” Thus it is told that he once saw a beautiful Gentile woman and, although it was the accepted custom among Jews not to express admiration for the beauty of a gentile woman he could not restrain his wonder and exclaimed: “God, how wonderful is your creation.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">עבודה זרה כ׳ א׳.</span></i>",

The peace loving elements of the population were annihilated. Some were killed by the Romans and others lost their lives at the hands of the patriots. There also occurred bloody clashes with the non-Jews living in the country and the Idumeans, who largely gave up the Jewish faith which they embraced five generations earlier, and joined forces with the enemy. The Samaritans (Kuthim) also evinced their violent hatred of the Jews.",

On one occasion one of the soldiers committed a nuisance against the wall of the temple and the enraged crowd fell upon him and killed him. When the other soldiers attempted to save him the crowd attacked them and the governor had to call the whole army to subdue the disorders. The narrow streets of Jerusalem, which were crowded with one and a half million pilgrims, became a field of slaughter in which about ten thousand Jews lost their lives in one day.",

During one of these clashes a Roman soldier seized a scroll of the Torah and trampled it in the dust after which he burnt it exclaiming that he trampled and burnt the Jewish God.

On their way they were attacked and slaughtered. This act was followed by a reprisal on the part of the inhabitants of Jerusalem who killed every Samaritan they could find and burned their villages.

Agrippa had the power to appoint the High Priest as he chose and he utilized this right extensively.

From the first moment Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel believed that Josephus was not a capable military leader and he also suspected that Josephus would surrender to the Romans on the first occasion.

This is due to the fact that aside from Agrippa I all the kings who ruled during the second temple are referred to in the Talmud as Jannai. Tosephoth remarks that it could not have been Alexander Jannai, the brother in law of Simeon ben Shetach, because the latter was High Priest himself and would never consent to give this office to another. There still remains some doubt as to the identity of Joshua ben Gamala because of the inconsistency that the man who “saved the Torah from being forgotten among Jews” should stoop to buy the high priesthood for money. It is for this reason that many historians claim that we are dealing with two different personalities. Rashi and Tosephoth (Baba Bathra, 21) maintain that it is one and the same person.</i>"

            "The Time of the Destruction of the Temple": [
                "F<small>ROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS</small> we get a clear picture of the political situation of the country and of its inhabitants as well as of the means that were employed by the enemy to oppress the people. But the internal life of the Jewish home was not greatly affected by the war which raged outside its walls. All those laws and customs which governed the life of the people were already strongly established to the smallest detail; the regulations concerning the daily prayers and the observance of the Sabbath and the holy days were definitely formed. The same was true regarding the family organization, the permissible and prohibited marriages, financial disputes among Jews as well the punishment of offenses against the public order. There were also well established dietary regulations and rules of cleanliness. All customs regarding offerings to the priests and the obligations toward the poor were defined. Even questions pertaining to the offering of sacrifices, which many scholars no longer considered as the most important foundation of the Jewish faith, and the laws affecting life and death, which were taken out of the jurisdiction of the Jewish courts, were codified in great detail together with their traditions and forms. But all of this legislation was not yet written down and the people had to guard it in their memory for use in future interpretations of the law.",
                "We may therefore definitely say that the whole “oral law” as we have it today was already completed by that time. Such disputes as arose over the interpretation of a text came about as a result of the fact that the law was not set down in writing and was contained in the memory of the students.",
                "In the observance of every day customs each one had his own traditions and these varied only slightly. But the regulations regarding cleanliness and the laws pertaining to the offering of sacrifices, which was no longer practiced, were increasingly disputed as time went on. Many of the regulations pertaining to sacrifices were forgotten soon after their offering was discontinued and it frequently occurred that a later scholar who never witnessed the service in the temple had to correct an older scholar who did witness the service but whose recollections were indistinct.",
                "A rule was therefore adopted that whenever one expressed an opinion about a practice which was no longer observed, such an opinion had only a theoretical significance as to the desirable form of the observance but it did not serve as proof that this had actually been the form in which the practice was observed in the past.",
                "Laws affecting civil disputes which involved monetary matters attained a high level of development. This was especially the case in the matter of offering proof which assumed numerous forms depending on the nature of the case; at times it was necessary to bring witnesses, at other times an oath, a written document or other proof of possession was required.",
                "Usually two witnesses were required in such law suits. Their testimony had to coincide and they had to be known as men of high moral standards. For this reason no “Am Haaretz” was eligible to be a witness nor a person who might be suspected of falsifying his testimony out of fear of one of the litigants or through irresponsible levity. Women, children, cripples (blind and deaf) and fools who cannot judge what they see were also ruled out as witnesses. Similarly relatives of the litigants were rejected and in case both witnesses were related only one of them was allowed to testify. Persons known as “wicked,” gamblers, pigeon thieves and usurers were ruled out because they were considered as robbers who deprive people of their money. The same was true of persons who dealt in fruit of the sabbatical year or who were suspected of robbery. Among those not qualified to testify were also included tax collectors for the Roman government, shepherds who graze their herds in strangers’ fields and people suspected of being personally interested in the case.",
                "There were cases when the court had to be satisfied with the testimony of only one witness. Thus the testimony of one witness to the death of a person was sufficient to free the widow to remarry. In other cases where the plaintiff could produce only one witness, the defendant could swear to his innocence and thus invalidate the testimony. Similar was the case of a woman who came before the court in times of peace and declared that her husband was dead. If she was known to have lived happily with him her testimony was accepted as valid in spite of the fact that women were not allowed to testify and despite the rule that no one might testify on his own behalf.",
                "When hearing a witness the court had to impress upon him the possible significance of his words and to cross question him minutely. If the witnesses contradicted each other the testimony of both was ruled out. If they recanted their testimony, they were considered as false witnesses and the punishment that was to be meted out to the defendant was imposed upon them. In some cases it was possible to convict a defendant on the basis of testimony of witnesses who did not see the crime themselves but who heard of it from the defendant. But there were also limitations such as that a man might not be convicted on the basis of his own confession even though such a confession was worth the testimony of a hundred witnesses, for no man could make himself out to be wicked.",
                "An oath was exacted when there were no witnesses or when only one witness appeared against the defendant. Similarly watchmen who disclaimed responsibility for damages to property while in their charge had to take an oath. This was also the case when a defendant admitted part of his guilt or one who denied guilt and was confronted by one witness. There were also cases when the plaintiff had to take an oath. These included workmen who claimed that they were not paid, the victim of a robbery in a case where the defendant pleaded not guilty, and the case of a man who was suspected of falsehood but against whom there were no witnesses.",
                "The best proof in a law suit was a written document atesting to a loan, an engagement, a marriage or a divorce. Other documents recognized were contracts of sale or purchase, wills affecting inheritance, certificates of gift, receipts, mortgages, evaluation of property during the division of an inheritance, certificates of alimony to a deserted wife or children, written declaration of a married minor rejecting her husband, statements of arbitration and numerous others. Sometimes an oath was required in addition to the written documents whenever the signatures on the latter were doubtful.",
                "Circumstantial evidence was highly regarded. Property in possession of a person was considered to be his own and any claim to it had to be proved by the claimant.",
                "[The people were at that time imbued with a strong desire to fortify and define their faith and it is remarkable that, in spite of the unfavorable political position of the Jews, Judaism nevertheless gained adherents and many neighboring peoples came closer to it. It may be assumed that the period was one of spiritual crisis among the heathen nations. Tiring of the idols many people confusedly speculated that the forces of nature are not gods but that they are part of an invisible power which governs the forces of nature. When they heard that Jews worship such an invisible God, many came to Judea to acquaint themselves with the worshippers of this God.",
                "It was characteristic that the seekers after a new truth mainly belonged to the upper educated strata of their nations. Adiabene, a small buffer state on the banks of the Tigris, was then ruled by a queen Helene. This queen was married to her brother Izates, and after his death she once visited Jerusalem. Deeply impressed by what she saw and especially by the religious ceremonials of the temple she was converted and adopted Judaism. Later her son, Izates II, also joined the faith.",
                "It is probable that some of the Jewish scholars of that time were not too happy over the new converts. It seems certain that the strict regulations against proselytes and the sharp expressions against them in the Talmud such as that “proselytes are as difficult for Jews as a swelling” all date from this period. The troubles which Jews had to withstand from the Samaritans and the Idumeans taught them to be careful in admitting new converts.",
                "Most of the proselytes of that time were women. Conversion was more difficult for men and fewer of them adopted Judaism. When king Izates II decided to become a Jew one of the scholars taught him the precepts of Judaism and told him that he must not undergo circumcision in order not to arouse the anger of his countrymen; it would be sufficient if he recognized the principles of the Jewish religion and the overlordship of an invisible God. But Izates was later circumcised when he realized that without this rite he was deprived of the rights of a Jew.",
                "Many highly placed persons strove toward the Jewish faith. They were intrigued by the high moral teachings of the Jewish religion although they did not highly regard the Jew as a person. It therefore seems certain that were the political situation of the Jewish nation more favorable all the surrounding nations would have embraced Judaism.",
                "It is also remarkable that some of the scholars of that time were but little concerned with the continued existence of the temple. Many events which then transpired were not written down and those that history did note express a definite tendency of thought. But it seems certain that some scholars considered the development of the Torah as more important than the maintenance of the temple. They probably reasoned that were the temple to be destroyed it could be rebuilt in more auspicious times but if the Torah were to be neglected it might spell the doom of the Jewish nation.",
                "It is also evident that some scholars did not attach much importance to the offering of sacrifices while others carefully pondered the minutest details of the temple service. This, however, took place after the temple was destroyed. Only after the temple was razed did the realization of its significance as a central national force dawn upon people. Only then did even those who considered the temple to be of minor importance in the Jewish religion grasp its importance. Revolutionary sentiment died down after the rebels were slaughtered or led captive to Rome to fight with wild beasts in its arenas. A new concept of the significance of sacrifices was then gained. It was now understood that when the text says that sacrifices are offered as “pleasing odors” it was not meant that God enjoys the odor of burnt flesh but rather that he is satisfied to see men do his will. When it was no longer possible to offer sacrifices, some scholars held that fasts and self-inflicted suffering are considered by God to be worthier than burnt offerings while others maintained that prayer was of greater importance than sacrifices.",
                "While the revolution was raging throughout the land the temple service was conducted as usual. At the same time, many scholars sought to escape from the revolution-torn city and they established a new sanctuary for the study of the Torah in Jabneh.",
                "The Romans did not yet persecute the study of the Torah, for in those days they did not see in the Torah any danger to the unity of the Roman empire. They therefore paid no attention to the scholarly pursuits as long as the Jews regularly paid their taxes to the government. It also seems certain that the Romans would have saved the temple from destruction were it not for their allies among the Jews who constantly called their attention to the fact that as long as the temple remained in existence Jews would never submit to Roman rule and no matter how much they were persecuted they would continue to revolt.",
                "Among the friends of the Romans who constantly insisted that the temple must be destroyed and that its continued existence gave encouragement to the embattled Jews, the foremost were the Jewish king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice. Berenice was not noted for modesty in her personal life and she became the mistress of Titus, the commander of the Roman army in Judea.",
                "The relations between Titus and Berenice are described in the Talmud in the following words: “He held a harlot by the hand and entered the Holy of Holies.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין נ״ז ב׳.</span></i> Just as the Talmud never referred to Herod except as “the Idumean slave” so also they referred to Berenice as a “harlot.”",
                "Historical legend relates that Titus commanded his soldiers not to harm the temple. But Agrippa and Berenice refused to obey him in this matter and hinted to the soldiers that they would never subdue the revolt as long as the temple remained intact. Berenice is said to have climbed on the shoulder of a Roman soldier and with her own hand to have thrown into the temple the burning torch which set fire to the building. When Titus heard that the temple was burning he ran to help put out the fire, but he came too late, for the flames had already enveloped the whole temple.",
                "It is obvious that one would not sin against historical truth if he disbelieved this legend. It was originated by Josephus who is not entirely trustworthy when chronicling the role of Titus and king Agrippa during the destruction of the temple.",
                "The revolt lasted many years. It was not concentrated in one locality but flared up in different sections of the country until it assumed a general nature and on a certain day the priests refused to offer the daily sacrifice for the welfare of the Roman emperor and also rejected sacrifices offered by non-Jews who lived in Judea.",
                "Friends of the Romans immediately informed the representatives of the government of the new turn in the tactics of the rebels. When Roman soldiers were dispatched to enforce the offering of the sacrifice for the welfare of the emperor and to force the acceptance of the sacrificial offerings of the non-Jews, the patriots occupied the temple and killed many of the soldiers who were stationed in Jerusalem and its vicinity.",
                "This action caused great confusion among the Jews because it was unauthorized and many prominent persons in Jerusalem publicly expressed their displeasure. For this expression of loyalty to the Romans the zealots executed many of them as well as numerous others whom they suspected of secret sympathy with the Romans.",
                "Later others declared that since the deed could not be undone it was necessary to wait for the reaction of Rome, meanwhile fortifying the cities in anticipation of the coming of the enemy.",
                "At that time there lived in Jerusalem three wealthy men who belonged to aristocratic families which could trace their descent as far back as king Saul and Moses. Their names were Nakdimon ben Gurion, Ben Kalba Savua and Ben Tzizith Hakeseth. These three undertook to supply the city with wheat and barley, wine and oil as well as salt and wood for the duration of the siege of Jerusalem even if that were to last many years.",
                "But the zealots were eager to come out in open struggle against the Romans and they felt sure that they were strong enough for the contest. They feared that the presence of large supplies of food during the forthcoming siege might induce the people to stay within the walls and discourage them from attacking the enemy outside the gates. They were therefore dissatisfied with the offer of the wealthy men and in the dark of night they burned the store rooms filled with grain. A great famine then followed the like of which the city never experienced before.",
                "The Roman governor meanwhile incited the Greek population of Caesarea against their Jewish neighbors. When the news of the clash became known, the Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem attacked the Greeks as well as other non-Jews within the city. This mutual enmity quickly enveloped the whole country and whenever Jew and non-Jew met a battle ensued in which the weaker side was given no mercy.",
                "These clashes spread to Acco, Haifa, Ascalon and other cities and also affected the Jews of Alexandria in Egypt who till this time lived peacefully. When the news reached Alexandria the Greek population began to attack the Jews and, meeting with resistance, they started a war of annihilation against them. The leader of the Greeks was a Jewish apostate Tiberius Alexander.",
                "The chronicles of these violent events speak of tens of thousands of people being killed. While it is possible that some of these figures are exaggerated there remains no doubt that large numbers perished and the horrors of the situation were not exaggerated.",
                "When the Romans finally decided to suppress the Jewish insurrection their army was put under the command of Galus. With him was the Jewish king Agrippa who acted as his guide and who instructed the soldiery to execute all those they met.",
                "Meanwhile the disturbances within Jerusalem gained in intensity from day to day. Outside the cities the Jewish warriors showed feats of prodigious valor which terrified the Romans to such an extent that many of them deserted their camp and joined the Jews in the struggle for liberation. But within Jerusalem there raged a violent struggle between those who wanted peace and the militants who demanded war.",
                "The story in the Talmud about the disputes between the school of Shammai (who wanted war) and the school of Hillel (who wanted peace) of which it is said that “a sword was placed within the temple and it was announced that one might enter but he might not leave until a decision was arrived at”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת י״ז א׳.</span></i> is interpreted by some historians to refer to the above mentioned conflicts. On another occasion it is told that “the disciples of Shammai stood at the foot of the wall armed with swords and spears and they beat the disciples of Hillel.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי שבת פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>",
                "Still others campaigned for war by means of the written word. There was then written the “Megillat Taanith” which cites all the afflictions which Jews had to withstand throughout their existence in order to arouse the people against the insufferable troubles. Others wrote “Megillat Beth Chashmonai,” the story of the Hasmonean family, which told of the causes of the Hasmonean revolt in order to remind the people of the great miracles which then transpired when a small handful of valiant Jews undertook the struggle against the mighty Greeks. All of this was aimed to encourage the rebels in the belief that God would certainly aid them against the Romans even though their military forces be small.",
                "The greatest error of the leaders of the war against Rome was committed when they appointed Josephus to head the war in Galilee. In his history of the war Josephus relates the tricks and intrigues to which he resorted in his fight against the insurrection up to the destruction of the temple. After the destruction he received an appointment from the Roman emperor and out of gratitude to Rome he assumed the surname Flavius which was also the name of the emperor Vespasian and his son Titus.",
                "To save the situation the Romans dispatched a horde of six hundred thousand armed men under the leadership of Vespasian against the Jewish rebels. Vespasian, who was noted for his victories over the Germans, proceeded to storm the fortresses outside of Jerusalem in an attempt to cut off that city from all avenues of escape. He was always successful in utilizing the aid of traitors who informed him of the weaknesses of the various cities and how they might best be taken. His conduct of the war lacked all ethics of combat and whenever he occupied a city after promising to spare its inhabitants, he invariably broke his promise and brutally slaughtered its residents.",
                "The Jews fought with indescribable heroism but they were everywhere betrayed and the Romans took one city after another. Jerusalem alone remained steadfast and would not surrender but it was afflicted by another difficulty. Tens of thousands of refugees from the surrounding towns fled into the city and attempted to dictate the activities of its inhabitants. A large portion of the Jerusalem population would have been glad to end the insurrection in any manner possible, but the zealots considered them as traitors and once a man was stamped by the suspicion of treason he could be killed without punishment.",
                "The mutual conflicts of the Jerusalem Jews as well as the famine which broke out after the food supplies were burned were a great encouragement to Vespasian who saw in them a sign that the gods were favoring him. Secure in the belief that Rome would triumph in the end, he was satisfied to watch the Jews aid him in his work.",
                "Vespasian meanwhile entrusted the conduct of the war to his son Titus who maintained friendly relations with king Agrippa II and with Josephus and was also on intimate terms with princess Berenice. These instructed him what means to employ and, knowing that the city was without food, they pointed out to him how he could also cut off its water supply. When these attempts brought no results, Titus announced to the besieged that he would provide food and drink to all those who would come out to him and that he would also permit them to return to the city.",
                "Many of the besieged were deceived by these promises and, as could be expected, Titus did not keep his promise. Some of the deserters were given salty food but no water; others were crucified in front of the fortress in full view of the besieged; still others had their arms cut off after which they were sent back into the city.",
                "But in spite of the siege the temple service continued until the 17th day of Tamuz. Throughout long months the inhabitants of the city had nothing to eat but the daily sacrifice was offered until the last lamb was gone and not even a handful of flour was left in the city. Then the sacrifice was discontinued and the fire on the altar expired.",
                "With the aid of famine and plagues, mutual conflict and other suffering which reached such a stage that the people were forced to become cannibalistic, the Romans conquered Jerusalem. But even when the Romans were already within the gates of the city the Jews continued to fight valiantly until they saw the temple in flames; only then did they lose their courage.",
                "No one believed that God would permit His temple to be destroyed and, when this finally did happen, everyone within the city, men and women, young and old, went about crazed with despair. Thousands cast themselves into the fire while others fell on their own swords.",
                "The burning of the temple marked a spiritual crisis in Jewish life. Their life became centered about the Torah and now Jerusalem was superseded by Jabneh.",
                "After four years of bloody warfare Jerusalem lay devastated, the temple destroyed, the best people of the nation were killed or dragged into captivity where they were sold as slaves into the copper and lead mines. The young men of the aristocratic families were forced to run after the triumphal chariot of Titus while carrying in their hands the vessels of the temple which became the booty of the Romans and after the celebration of the triumph they had to face each other as well as wild animals in battles staged in the arenas of Rome for the pleasure of the populace.",
                "These spectacles were visited among others by the ex-king Agrippa, his sister Berenice and Josephus who later described those wars in a tone of praise to Vespasian.",
                "Jabneh developed into an important city during the revolt preceding the destruction of the temple. Its population was so large that the city provided forty thousand men for the war; it may therefore be reckoned that its population was about two hundred thousand. When the Romans spared the city they hardly knew the strength which was inherent in the Torah and how dangerous for them it might become.",
                "It seems certain that many of the scholars left Jerusalem before the destruction of the temple because of their refusal to participate in the revolt. These settled in Jabneh which was apparently not affected by the tumult of war. When Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai visited the emperor Vespasian in his camp, he found favor in his eyes and Vespasian asked him to make a request. Rabban Jochanan did not ask that Jerusalem or the temple be spared but he requested that Jabneh and its scholars be saved. This clearly indicates that Jabneh was already then the home of a large number of scholars.",
                "Jabneh then became the center of Judaism — a new Jerusalem without a temple or sacrifices. A new Sanhedrin was organized which assumed the rights of the previous Sanhedrin of Jerusalem to regulate Jewish life according to the interpretations of the Torah. The scholars of Jabneh were of no less stature than those of Jerusalem. They would not have been chosen had they not been men of great religious and secular learning as well as masters of the languages of the neighboring peoples, so as to be able to try cases between Jews and non-Jews without having to resort to outside experts and interpreters.",
                "The scholars of Jabneh gathered in a place which was called “the vineyard of Jabneh.” The meaning of this name is not entirely clear and some claim that it refers to their manner of being seated in rows just as vines are planted in a vineyard.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ד׳.</span></i> In Jabneh the decision was finally made that in all disputes between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel the law should be practiced according to the school of Hillel.

When the Talmud states that after the death of the last prophets (Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi) the Holy Spirit (Ruach Hakodesh) appeared no more and the “Bath Kol” took its place, Tosephoth remark that “some say they did not hear a voice coming from heaven but only an echo such as one hears reflected.” (Sanhedrin, 11.)</i> which announced that the opinions of the school of Shammai are also from God but that only the opinions of the school of Hillel should be put into practice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי ברכות פרק א׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>",
                "When the people saw that sacrifices were no longer offered they fell into a great despair. Many of them could not understand the value of the prayers that were substituted for the sacrifices and the weaker ones joined the various religious sects that sought a new god outside of the Jewish faith. It was then that the Tana Shmuel Hakatan established the prayer against the disbelievers (<span dir=\"rtl\">ברכת המינים</span>) which curses all those who depart from the Jewish faith to be taken from among the living.",
                "Many laws were codified in Jabneh and special attention was paid to determining the first of the month and the feast days. This calendar was also valid for the Jews of Rome, Greece, Egypt and Babylon.",
                "Jabneh thus became a place of refuge for fugitives from the strife in Jerusalem. While the tumult of war was still resounded and the hearts of the people contracted in pain at sight of the dead and wounded and at the sound of the Roman cheers, this group of scholars forged the essence of the Jewish nation. It was not difficult for them to find that which they sought. They realized that the Torah was the only hope for continued national existence and their work could not be hindered by strangers nor by all the legions of the Romans. While the enemy could kill people, destroy the temple and lay waste the land he could not annihilate the spirit of the nation.",
                "After a short time there was also founded in Jabneh a court having the same powers as the court in Jerusalem. The text of the Bible that “if a thing shall be hidden from you in a judgment between blood and blood or between one claim and another or between one damage and another in a dispute within your gates, you shall arise and go to the place which the Lord God will choose” (Deut. 17:8) they interpreted to mean that the court gives authority to the place where it is located and not the place to the court; it was therefore concluded that Jabneh might also be such a place.",
                "Jabneh came to be considered the equal of Jerusalem in the matter of some customs such as the blowing of the Shofar (ram’s horn) on Rosh Hashanah when the first day of the year happens on a Sabbath. In such a case it was previously prohibited to blow the Shofar on Sabbath outside of Jerusalem where no sacrifices were offered.",
                "It is related that the introduction of this custom in Jabneh met with some difficulties. Prominent opponents of this measure, such as the men of Bathyra whose ancestors once headed the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, could not compromise with the idea that Jabneh should be considered the equal of Jerusalem in sanctity and that the blowing of the Shofar on a Sabbath should be permitted within it. They wanted to debate the matter with Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai but he said: “Let us first blow the Shofar and then we shall debate the issue.” When they wanted to debate the question after this was done he said to them: “Now that the sound of the Shofar has been heard in Jabneh it is useless to debate the matter.”",
                "Until this time it was the custom that the head of the Court had to announce the beginning of the new month but in Jabneh it was ruled that any member of the court might announce the beginning of the new month even in the absence of the head of the court.",
                "The basis for these new innovations was that with the destruction of the temple the needs of the people changed in accordance with the new political situation. The great changes which the events of that time brought about eliminated the original purpose of many of the customs and they had to be changed according to the new state of affairs. It is characteristic of the people that they adapted themselves rapidly to the changed circumstances and looked at the present and toward the near future instead of to the past.",
                "As the people devoted themselves to the observance of the commandments according to the traditions of the oral law, they gained the necessary strength to rise above the gloom of the present and to concentrate their thoughts on spiritual matters. Their first activity was to gather all the traditions and to put them down in writing. Seeing that many old customs were being forgotten and that even some of the scholars, who were active in the academy, sometimes forgot that which they had seen, they began to collect in book form all the traditional customs and laws including those that were no longer practiced after the destruction of the temple."

                "“Then advise me how I can leave the city. Perhaps I shall be able to bring some salvation for myself and for others,” Rabban Jochanan said.",
                "To this Abba Sikra answered: “Pretend that you are sick and have people come to visit you. Afterward have it announced that you died but permit only your disciples to attend to the funeral and to carry your body out of the city, for strangers may become aware that they are carrying a living body.”",
                "The advice of Abba Sikra was followed to the letter and when the pall bearers approached the gate of the city the guards wanted to pierce the body in order to make sure that it was really dead. But Abba Sikra said to them: “Do not so, for if the Romans hear of it they will say ‘The Jews have stabbed their Rabbi.’” The guards then wanted to throw the body from the litter and Abba Sikra again intervened saying, “Do not so, for if the Romans hear of it they will say ‘The Jews have thrown the body of their Rabbi on the ground.’”",
                "Upon finding himself outside the city, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai at once repaired to the Roman camp to see Vespasian, who was then conducting the siege of Jerusalem. After he gained his confidence with his wise words, and especially because Vespasian knew of his favorable attitude toward peace with the Romans, Vespasian asked him to request whatever he liked. Rabban Jochanan asked for three things: his first request was to spare Jabneh and its scholars; the second request was to spare the family of Rabban Gamliel the Elder; the third request was to provide a doctor for Rabbi Zadok who spent forty years in fasting and prayer to God to spare the temple.",
                "On this occasion the Talmud remarks that sometimes God deprives the wise of their intelligence, for Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai should have asked that the Romans give up the siege. But the same paragraph which criticizes Rabban Jochanan also defends him by saying that he refrained from speaking about the siege for fear of gaining nothing if he asked for too much.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין נ״ו.</span></i>",
                "The manner in which Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai came before Vespasian is related in a somewhat different manner in the Midrash.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">איכה רבתי פרק א׳ פּיסקא ל״א.</span></i>",
                "According to this version the name of Rabban Jochanan’s nephew was Ben Batiach and it further states that when the zealots of Jerusalem burned the food stores which the three wealthiest men of the city gave to the inhabitants to tide them over the period of the siege, Rabban Jochanan Ben Zakkai cried in anguish. It was immediately reported to Ben Batiach that his uncle cried out “Woe” (Vai). Ben Batiach summoned his uncle and asked him: “Why did you cry out ‘Woe’?” But Rabban Jochanan replied: “I did not cry out ‘Woe’ but ‘Wah.’” (Wah, was an exclamation of joy.)",
                "Ben Batiach further queried, “Why were you so glad?” To this Rabban Jochanan replied, “I was glad that you burned all the food supplies, for so long as there is food within the city you will not succeed in getting the people to participate in the war.”",
                "Three days later Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was walking in the street and he saw people boiling straw and drinking the broth. He then remarked that if people who boil straw to drink the broth attempt an insurrection against Vespasian and his army, it was best to leave the place.",
                "He then sent to Ben Batiach a message saying: “Allow me to leave the city.” But Ben Batiach answered, “We have an agreement to permit no living person to leave the city.”",
                "According to the Midrash Eichah, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai did request Vespasian to give up the siege but Vespasian is said to have answered: “The Romans have made me emperor that I should destroy this land, but you may take out of the city all the friends that you wish to save from death.”",
                "According to another legend, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai once saw the daughter of Nakdimon ben Gurion, who was one of the three wealthiest men who undertook to provide the city with food before the zealots burned their food stores, picking barley from beneath the horses’ hooves. He then exclaimed: “When Jews do the will of God, no nation on earth can rule over them; but when they ignore the will of God, He hands them over to a lower nation, not only that, He even hands them over to its horses.”",
                "“Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan” relates the manner of Jochanan’s leaving Jerusalem in a much simpler form. According to this source Rabban Jochanan simulated death and succeeded in escaping with the aid of his disciples only without his nephew being involved in it.",
                "The origin and descent of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai remains unknown. For three generations the house of Hillel ruled the religious life of the Jews, and the people obeyed it because they considered it to be an offshoot of the royal house of David. Suddenly there appeared an outsider, who was held to be the least of Hillel’s disciples, and the whole people followed him. Many years before the destruction of the temple, people flocked from near and far to hear him expound the Torah. It was for this reason that Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai considered himself a representative of the nation and it was as such that he spoke to Vespasian.",
                "In those days he was in the habit of sitting in the shadow of the temple and expounding the Torah, all day long, before an audience which was too numerous to be accommodated by the temple. The wall of the temple was one hundred ells high and it cast a broad shadow where many could find protection from the sun. Rabban Jochanan concerned himself but little with the brutal oppression of the Romans or with the terrible disputes which rent the Jewish parties. This was also his attitude years later when he taught in Jabneh after the destruction of the temple and he refrained from commenting on the political situation. The content of his teachings was devoted to peace and even during the days of the sharpest struggle he was not afraid to speak of the necessity for peace with Rome.",
                "Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was a pupil of Hillel. Since he survived the destruction of Jerusalem and was later active in Jabneh, there seems to be no exaggeration in the tradition which claims that he lived to be 120 years of age. It may also be said of him what was said of Moses that “his eyes were not dimmed nor did his freshness leave him.”",
                "Hillel himself recognized the worth of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. When Hillel became sick, before his death his disciples came to visit him, but Rabban Jochanan remained standing outside the door. “Where is the small Jochanan?” Hillel asked, and he then predicted that when Jochanan would grow up he would be “a father in wisdom and a father for future generations.”",
                "It is told that even long before the destruction Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai understood that the Jews would not be able to withstand the Romans and that the temple would be destroyed in the end. A legend relates that forty years before, its destruction, the gates of the temple began to open by themselves as if ready to receive the enemy. Rabban Jochanan is said to have scolded them for their fear saying: “Everyone knows that you will be destroyed, but you do not have to open your gates to make the entrance of the enemy easier.”",
                "Even before the temple was destroyed, Rabban Jochanan found himself a place named Arav (near Sepphoris) where he spent eighteen years, but in all this time he reached only two verdicts. He therefore concluded that the place was not adapted to the study of the Torah and he said that since Galilee hates the Torah it would in the ent revert to being a region of robbers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי שבת פרק ט״ו הלכה ח׳.</span></i>",
                "With his great intelligence Rabban Jochanan grasped the whole Torah including all its interpretations, laws and legends; his every word was carefully weighed and he did not engage in idle conversation\t.(<span dir=\"rtl\">שיחת חולין</span>) He never walked four ells without speaking of the Torah or without phylacteries. While on the street he had a friendly greeting for Jew and non-Jew alike. He was the first to come to the academy and the last to leave it, nor was he ever seen sitting idly or asleep, but he always was engaged in study. He allowed no one to open the door of the academy for his disciples but he opened the door himself for every one and led each one to his place. He never said that it was time to go home except on the eve of Passover in order to slaughter the Paschal offering and on the eve of the Day of Atonement in order to prepare for the fast.",
                "Of his master, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai said: “If all the heavens were parchments and all the trees were quills and all the seas were ink it would still be impossible to write down even a part of what I learned from my teacher. And all this,” he would add, “is only as much as a fly might absorb when plunging into the great sea.”",
                "But Rabban Jochanan did not consider his great learning to be a virtue deserving of praise. He was in the habit of saying: “If you have learned much, do not be proud of it. It was for this purpose that you were born.” He also said: “Whoever possesses wisdom without fear (of God) is like a craftsman without tools.”",
                "He believed that the Torah protects from death, and when all the male offspring of a certain priestly family of his day died at the age of eighteen years, he declared that they must be descendants of Eli, upon whom there rested the curse of early death for all men. If, however, they would have devoted themselves to the Torah then its virtue would have protected them from the curse.",
                "It is charactristic of Rabban Jochanan that he was not deeply influenced by the destruction of the temple. A legend relates that when he learned of its destruction he tore his clothes but when he heard his disciple Rabbi Joshua mourn: “Woe to us, the place that has brought forgiveness for the transgressions of the Jews has been destroyed,” Rabban Jochanan replied: “Do not be grieved for we have another means to attain forgiveness of our sins and that is through charity.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ד׳ משנה ה׳.</span></i>",
                "The great crisis, which the destruction of the temple marked in Jewish life, met with a different response among the two diametrically opposed elements within the nation. One group could not reconcile itself to the destruction; the essence of their faith was centered in the temple, and when that was burned they became obsessed with the idea that the whole nation was destroyed along with it. Unable to adapt themselves to the new circumstances, these renounced their lives or joined some of the outlandish religious growths which then cropped up profusely.",
                "But there was another group which secretly nurtured its sorrow. These even felt certain that God would not allow the temple to remain desolate for long and they drew encouragement from the historical fact that the “Babylonian captivity” lasted only seventy years. They fervently believed that the predictions of the prophets regarding the future of Jerusalem and the renewal of the temple would certainly be fulfilled. But until a new temple should be erected they meanwhile introduced customs to take the place of the sacrifices; they devoted themselves to pondering the sanctity of the Jewish nation and delved deeply into the Torah and its interpretations.",
                "Meanwhile death and destruction stalked the land. Not satisfied with the desolation of the land and the blood which they shed, the Romans daily introduced new laws to humiliate the Jews. Knowing that the Jews had taxed themselves a half “shekel” per person for the maintenance of the temple, the Romans levied a tax of fifteen shkolim (thirty times as much) on every person for the expenses of their temple of Jupiter who “helped them triumph over their enemies.”",
                "When the reports of the valor of the Jews in the war became known and the world realized that without the aid of Jewish traitors mighty Rome with its iron legions could not have conquered the small land of Judea, the Roman rulers hired scribes to belittle the bravery of the Jewish warriors and to make them appear as ordinary robber bands which could have been annihilated by a single Roman battalion were it not that the “kind” Titus sought to spare the land but, his patience becoming exhausted, he decided to show the rebels the might of Rome.",
                "Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai wanted to establish the custom of pilgrimages to Jabneh to take the place of the previous pilgrimages to Jerusalem. In this he but partly succeeded. Many people did come from far and near to celebrate the feast days in Jabneh and especially those Jews who lived outside of Judea who came to find out the law regarding matters of which they were in doubt. But the majority of the people continued to observe their feast days in the desolate Jerusalem on the site of the burned temple, which lost none of its sanctity in their eyes.",
                "Rabban Jochanan did succeed in concentrating the priests about himself in Jabneh that they might wait there until called to the rebuilding of a new temple. In the meantime he instructed the people to observe the commandments of offering the tithes and the priests had to observe all the laws of cleanliness and to eat their tithes in purity even as they did when the temple was in existence.",
                "Even as he previously did in Jerusalem, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai now continued to search for the basic explanation of all the laws and in this he was highly successful. Every commandment of the Torah he explained in wise and convincing words. Only in the matter of the prohibition of the use of the flesh of pigs and of wearing “Shatnes” (cloth woven out of wool and flax), the commandments of “Halitza” and “Yibum” (the marriage of a childless widow to her husband’s brother), the laws of the purification of lepers, the scapegoat sent to Azazel on the Day of Atonement and the sacrifice of the red heifer, these he did not attempt to rationalize. These were all laws of such a fundamental nature, he was wont to say, that they should not be debated.",
                "A “Hebrew slave” who refused his freedom at the end of six years of servitude had the lobe of his ear pierced, Rabban Jochanan explained, because the ear heard the words of God uttered from mount Sinai that “all Jews are my servants.” He who has exchanged the rule of God for the rule of man is deserving that his ear be pierced as a sign of eternal shame.",
                "Once his disciples asked Rabban Jochanan why no iron might be used in the construction of an altar. To this he replied that since swords, which are a symbol of punishment, are made out of iron while the altar is a symbol of forgiveness, it is necessary to keep these two opposing symbols apart. And if the inanimate stones of the altar, which cannot speak or think, must not be cut with iron because they cause peace to be made between Jews and their Father in Heaven, one must therefore consider how much more honor is due to a person who makes peace between man and wife, between one city and another, between one nation and another or between one family and another.",
                "In spite of the fact that the temple was burned and Jerusalem was destroyed, the Jews did not consider themselves as exiles so long as they remained on their own soil. But all those Jews who lived in Babylonia and other lands were considered to be in captivity since Nebuchadnezzar exiled them. Rabban Jochanan was once asked by his disciples why God caused most of the Jews to be exiled to Babylonia and he answered that they were like a woman who sins against her husband and is sent by him to her father’s home. God exiled the Jews to Babylonia when they sinned against him because that is the land that Abraham came from.",
                "There is an opinion that Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai was a priest and that he officiated in the service in the temple together with the other priests. Thus it is told that his disciples asked him about some custom pertaining to sacrifices, but when he answered they were dissatisfied with his reply and proved to him that he did not remember the procedure in the temple on certain occasions. Rabban Jochanan said: “You are right. I have forgotten what I did myself.” When he was still in Jerusalem he came into conflict with the High Priest, whom he threatened with revenge, but this High Priest died before his plan of vengeance was carried out.",
                "Rabban Jochanan also objected, while still in Jerusalem, to the procedure of stunning the animals brought as sacrifices in order to facilitate their slaughter. He claimed that such a procedure crippled the animal and caused unclean flesh to be offered on the altar.",
                "It is obvious that while the Romans ruled over the lives and the possessions of the Jews in a barbaric fashion the morals of the Jewish women could not remain in their former purity. The royal house of Agrippa II as well as his sister Berenice and some of the priests of that time could hardly serve as an example of morality for Jewish women. Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai realized that Jewish family life was being wrecked by this immorality. He then abolished the procedure of taking a <span dir=\"rtl\">סוטה</span> before a priest and the administering of the water since it would have to be applied to the majority of the women of Judea if it remained in force.",
                "Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai frequently debated the commandments of the Torah with non-Jews. Despite the fact that the Jews lost the war and that the Romans hired scribes to slander them, this was a time when numerous Gentile scholars were deeply interested in the Torah and were anxious to discuss its commandments with Jews. They were amazed at the stubborness with which this small people clung to its faith.",
                "Rabban Jochanan engaged in similar disputations with the Sadducees. Although these no longer existed as a separate party, there were still men in prominent positions who conducted themselves according to the teachings of the Sadducees. Rabban Jochanan was wont to debate with them and attempted to prove that they were not Jews.",
                "But his attitude was entirely different when disputing with a Gentile. When one of these asked him whether there would ever come a day when Jews and Gentiles would be happy, Rabban Jochanan answered that it would have to be a rainy day.",
                "Later his disciples asked him whether God approved of charitable deeds of Gentiles because the verse “the kindness of nations is a sin” was then commonly interpreted to mean that even good deeds of Gentiles are sinful. Rabban Jochanan said that the real meaning of the verse is different from the accepted one and that it intends to convey the idea that just as a sin offering brings forgiveness for Jews even so do charitable deeds compensate for the sins of Gentiles.",
                "Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai devoted himself a great deal to the mysteries of the creation of the world and to the “Divine Chariot” of Ezekiel’s prophecy. A legend relates that he was once riding on a donkey while his best pupil, Rabbi Elazar ben Arach, was walking after him. Rabbi Elazar said: “Let us now study a chapter on the construction of the Chariot.” But Rabban Jochanan said that one must not discuss this subject with only one pupil unless he is one who understands everything himself without explanation from his teacher. To this Rabbi Elazar answered: “Then let me expound the construction of the Chariot and you will see whether I understand it without an explanation of my teacher.”",
                "Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai descended from his donkey and, wrapping himself in his robe, they sat down on a rock under an olive tree. After he heard the exposition of his pupil he kissed him on the head and said: “Blessed be the God of Israel who granted to Father Abraham a son who understands so much and who expounds so nicely for the glory of his Father in Heaven.”",
                "Out of the great number of his pupils five were particularly noteworthy and Rabban Jochanan praised each of them for his virtues. The names of the five were: R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, R. Joshua ben Chananiah, R. Jose Hacohen, R. Simeon ben Nathanel and R. Elazar ben Arach. Of these Rabban Jochanan said that R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus was like a lime pit which does not lose a single drop of water; of R. Joshua ben Chananiah he said, happy is the mother who gave birth to such a son; of R. Jose Hacohen he said that he was pious; R. Simeon ben Nathanel avoided sin and R. Elazar ben Arach was like a spring which wells up ever stronger.",
                "Of them Rabban Jochanan said further: “If the wisdom of all Jewish scholars were to be placed on one side of the scale and the wisdom of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus on the other side than his wisdom would outweigh that of all the others.” At a later date he was said to have declared: “If the wisdom of all the Jewish scholars together with that of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus were to be placed on one side of the scale and the wisdom of R. Elazar ben Arach were to be placed on the other side, then his would outweigh that of all the others.”",
                "There seems to have been no limit to the reverence which the disciples of Rabban Jochanan accorded him. They referred to him in no other terms than “the light of Israel,” “the right pillar” and “the strong hammer.” They said of him that he was the only teacher of kindness and peace who realized the worth of human freedom for he sharply opposed slavishness in man. Rabban Jochanan also admired all good qualities in man irrespective of what nation that man belonged to. When he taught the necessity of loving God, he instructed that He should be loved as a child loves its father and not as a slave loves his lord.",
                "When Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai left Jerusalem he established his academy in Jabneh but his private residence was in a place called “Barur Chail” and there he was followed by his disciples. It seems that when Rabban Gamliel II (the son of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel who was killed before the destruction of the temple) grew of age and Rabban Jochanan realized that he was fit to occupy the position of his father in the leadership of Jewish life, he resigned his position of “Nasi.” He gave this office to Rabban Gamliel and he settled in “Barur Chail.” But even there he was followed by many people who did not leave him till the day of his death.",
                "As the days of Rabban Jochanan neared their end, he regretted the oncoming death. When his disciples came to visit him, he wept in their presence. They asked him: “Rabbi, why do you weep?” and he replied, “When a man has to appear for trial before a king whose rule is only temporary, whose kindness is passing and whose anger does not last, he is seized by terror; how much more understandable is the terror which seizes one who has to be tried by the King of kings whose rule is eternal, whose anger is everlasting and whose kindness endures forever.”"

                "One of these scholars, the closest to R. Jochanan, was Rabbi Zadok ben Elazar. This was the same Rabbi Zadok for the healing of whom Rabban Jochanan asked for the services of a doctor. Just as Rabban Jochanan visualized the destruction of the temple forty years before it occurred even so did Rabbi Zadok fast every day for forty years that the temple might not be destroyed.",
                "It is told that when Rabban Jochanan presented Rabbi Zadok before Vespasian in the Roman camp outside of Jerusalem he showed more reverence to Rabbi Zadok than he did to Vespasian. When Vespasian noted this he asked, “What distinction has this man?” and Rabban Jochanan replied: “I can assure you that had there been another one like him you could not have triumphed over our people even if you had brought twice as many soldiers as you did.”",
                "Vespasian further asked, “Wherein lies his strength?” and Rabban Jochanan answered, “For forty years he neither ate nor drank anything more than the juice of one fig which he consumed every night and after this he taught a host of disciples all day. You can therefore realize that had there been another like him, God would have had to spare our city for the sake of two such holy men.”",
                "It is further told that once, when Rabbi Zadok was a priest in the temple, he saw two young priests hurrying to the service. In their haste they tried to overtake each other and when the nimbler one gained the lead he was stabbed by the one that trailed behind. Rabbi Zadok then called out in this wise: “Hear me oh, Jews. Here you see the body of a slain man and you all learned that when a murdered man is found and it is not known by whom he was killed it is necessary to behead a calf and over it the elders of the city must declare that they are innocent of the blood that was shed, that their hand was not in the crime, nor have they seen it committed. Now there arises the question arises whether the city or the temple has to bring this case, for I alone saw the crime and the law states that one witness is insufficient to condemn a man to death. According to the law it would therefore seem that the identity of the murderer has not been established and it is necessary for the elders to declare their innocence. Now the question whether the city or the temple has to bring this offering, for neither one of the two can conscientiously say “our hands did not shed this blood”; both the city and the people are guilty and the blood of the murdered man is a blot on both.”",
                "Speaking in this vein he aroused all those gathered until they shed tears. When the father of the murdered man later declared that the victim was not killed outright and the dagger with which he was stabbed was therefore not unclean from coming in contact with a dead body, and he thus established that it was unnecessary to bring a sacrifice, because the victim atoned with his blood for the sins of the city, all those gathered rushed at the murderer and in an instant he was annihilated so that nothing remained of him.",
                "It was also told of Rabbi Zadok that R. Gamliel ben R. Simeon (commonly referred to as Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, he was also Nasi after the death of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai) once gave a feast in his house for the scholars. Rabban Gamliel waited on his guests himself and with his own hand he filled their beakers. He handed the first beaker of wine to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus but Rabbi Eliezer refused it, not wishing to be waited on by Rabban Gamliel. Rabban Gamliel then handed the same beaker to Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and he accepted it.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer then exclaimed: “How can one tolerate that Rabban Gamliel should stand and wait on us while we are sitting down?” but Rabbi Joshua answered: “One greater than Rabban Gamliel did the same. Our father Abraham was the greatest man of his generation, nevertheless he waited on his guests and served them. Even though his guests were angels, Abraham did not at first know it but thought that they were Arabs. I therefore see no wrong in that Rabban Gamliel serves the students of the Torah.”",
                "Rabbi Zadok then arose from his place and said: “How much longer will you remain indifferent to the honor of God while you devote yourself to the honor due to man? God causes the winds to blow and the rain to fall, he fructifies the earth and provides for every creature according to its needs. All this he does not only for the just but also for the wicked and the idolaters. Is it not more than right that scholars like you should be served by Rabban Gamliel himself?”",
                "Sometime later Rabbi Zadok saw the ruins of the temple and, turning his eyes heavenward, he said: “Creator of the world, You have done well. You have destroyed Your city, You burned Your temple and You remain calm as if You were not concerned.” That same night Rabbi Zadok had a dream. In his dream he saw God mourning over the ruins of the temple while the angels were weeping bitterly. He then became convinced that God mourned the destruction just as the people did.",

His son devoted himself to commerce mostly and he obtained the title of Rabbi although he did not found an academy. When Rabbi Zadok was cured after his long fast through the intercession of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai with Vespasian, his son said to him: “Give your healers their reward in this world that they may make no demands upon you in the world to come.” Instead of paying them with gold, Rabbi Zadok taught them to calculate on their fingers and also the rules of the calculation of weights.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">איכה רבתי פּרשה א׳ פּיסקא ל״א.</span></i>",

Then Rabbi Zechariah said: “I swear by the sanctity of the temple that as long as the soldiers were in Jerusalem I did not let my wife out of my sight.” But the other scholars told him that no one might be trusted when testifying on his own behalf.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות כ״ז א׳ וב׳.</span></i>",

Long before the destruction of the temple he was recognized as the leader of his own academy which remained a separate school and was not under the jurisdiction of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.",
                "It is told that whenever Rabbi Nechunia went to his academy and returned home from it he would repeat a prayer whose contents have become immortalized and which serves as an example for later generations. When asked about his prayer he said: “When I go to the academy I pray to God to save me from error; that I should have no occasion to be angered at my comrades, nor that they should have to be angered with me. I pray that in my teachings I should not declare the clean to be unclean and the unclean to be clean, and that I should not be put to shame either in this world or in the world to come. When I leave the academy I thank the Creator for all that happened to me during the day; especially do I thank Him for this that it is my share to sit in a house of learning and not among the sinful, the idle and the scornful, for my way leads to eternal life and their way leads to hell.”",

When his disciples asked him what he had done to deserve to be rewarded with long life he answered them: “I never sought to gain honor through the shame of another; I also never went to sleep until I knew that there was no person harboring ill will against me and I was never stingy with my money.”",
                "Although Rabbi Nechunia headed an academy of his own there always existed the most friendly relations between him and Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. This was clearly illustrated at the time when Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai expounded to his disciples the meaning of the Biblical verse “Justice exalteth a people but the disgrace of nations is a sin.” (Proverbs, 14:34.) Everyone was asked to express his opinion of the meaning of the verse. At the request of Rabban Jochanan, Rabbi Nechunia also stated his interpretation whereupon Rabban Jochanan said to his pupils: “I favor the opinion of Rabbi Nechunia more than my own and more than the opinions which you rendered.”",

Another interpretation of his statement is that a person who has forfeited his life for desecrating the Sabbath does not in addition have to offer a sacrifice for the atonement of his sin; similarly, one who desecrated the Day of Atonement does not have to offer such a sacrifice even though the punishment for his transgression is in the hands of God.",

Pharaoh asked Moses, “Who is God that I should listen to his voice?” but later, when he was being engulfed by the waters of the sea he realized that the God of Moses was the true God and in order to gain favor in His eyes he cried out, “Who is like you among the gods oh Lord!” God therefore saved him from the sea and he later became king of Nineveh. When the prophet Jonah came to Nineveh to announce the word of God, Pharaoh already understood that he spoke in the name of the God of Moses, who may not be resisted.

The sand which Nachum brought in the box was therefore tried on the enemy and its effects were so marvelous that the enemy was immediately subdued. When the emperor realized the value of the sand which the Jews sent him he decided to do kind deeds to Jews.

                "While other scholars of that time attempted to set up academies in various cities of Palestine in an endeavor to spread the knowledge of the Torah throughout the land, Rabban Gamliel sought to concentrate all of these efforts in Jabneh. He met considerable difficulties in attaining this aim and he was compelled to resort to forceful methods and a stubborn insistence on his decisions; these in turn frequently served to alienate from him the sympathies of the followers of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. He then would go on protracted trips to places far and near to investigate the life of the Jews, their economic welfare and their religious life. He was thus frequently to be seen in Jericho, in Acco or in Kezib and wherever he went he spoke his word in all matters of Jewish life.",
                "Of his relations with other people it is told that he was very careful not to cause the slightest suffering to anyone. When he discovered how many rules one must observe and that it was almost impossible to avoid conflict with friends and neighbors, he wept. In general he was a very kind person and prone to tears. When a neighboring woman lost her only son and her weeping was heard for many nights, Rabban Gamliel could not restrain his commiseration and wept until his eye lashes were soft.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין ק״ד ב׳.</span></i>",
                "But in his execution of his duties as Nasi he showed not the least weakness. Here he ruled with a strong hand and was ready to crush all opposition by excommunicating or driving out the opponent without considering the position or his relationship to the antagonist. Rabban Gamliel wanted his decisions to be final and he did not permit any decisions to be made without his consent. He therefore ordered an investigation of the opinions of all his pupils and whenever it was discovered that one secretly dissented, he was not permitted to enter the academy.",
                "Rabban Gamliel owned much land and other property but he did not have time to devote to its management and he therefore rented these out to tenants. If a tenant lacked the money to buy seed, Rabban Gamliel loaned him the money or the seed which was to be repaid after the harvest. But when harvest came he always reckoned the debt according to the lower price. Thus if the price of the seed was lower at harvest time than it was at the time that the seed was loaned, he asked to be repaid the harvest season price; similarly if the price went up, he asked for the lower price at the time that the seed was loaned. Although the law did not require such treatment of tenants, he did this in order to prevent suspicion that he was profiting from his tenants.",
                "Being a wealthy man, Rabban Gamliel also owned numerous slaves whom he treated kindly according to the regulations of the Torah. He was particularly attached with a strong bond of friendship to his slave Tobi who, he boasted, was a scholar of no mean ability. When Tobi died, Rabban Gamliel mourned for him as for a member of his family.",
                "Of his relationship to Tobi it is told that Rabban Gamliel wanted to free him but could find no cause for doing so. When once he accidentally blinded Tobi in one eye, Rabban Gamliel was overjoyed, for this would give him an opportunity to free the slave according to the rule of the Torah. But when he told this to Rabbi Joshua he was informed that he could not do so because the slave had no witnesses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא קמא ע״ד ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Rabban Gamliel was also versed in the knowledge of mathematics and astronomy. To derive practical benefits from this knowledge he had a type of telescope made with which he could discern objects at a distance of two thousand ells both on land and on sea. In his house he had numerous drawings of the moon and when ignorant witnesses came to announce the new moon, they could point to the picture most nearly resembling what they saw.",
                "Rabban Gamliel served the people as Nasi for over thirty years and although he was strict in the conduct of his office he was wont to say that his position was not that of a ruler but of a servant. He served faithfully and with devotion. In addition to his labors for the preservation of Judaism while travelling about, his period in office coincided with a difficult time for Jews. New decrees against the Jews were daily issued by the Romans and Rabban Gamliel constantly had to intercede to ameliorate the effects of these decrees.",
                "As we mentioned above, Rabban Gamliel spared no opponent in his capacity of Nasi. When Rabbi Eliezer tried to establish a law according to the school of Shammai, he was excommunicated by Rabban Gamliel despite the fact that he was his brother-in-law. The scholars of the academy thereupon sharply criticized Rabban Gamliel for banning so brilliant a man as Rabbi Eliezer. Some time later Rabban Gamliel was travelling on a ship to visit distant Jewish settlements. The ship encountered tremendous waves which threatened to capsize it and Rabban Gamliel understood that this was a punishment for the ban which he imposed on Rabbi Eliezer. He then raised his hands to heaven and said: “God knows that I have done so not for the sake of my honor nor for the honor of my household but solely for the honor of God and in order to prevent disputes among Jews.” When he finished speaking the sea at once became calm and he safely arrived at his destination.",
                "One of the chief opponents of Rabban Gamliel was Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Rabbi Joshua was known as a gentle peace loving man. He was always dissatisfied with the innovations of Rabban Gamliel but he was powerless to contradict them because of his great poverty. Rabbi Joshua gained his livelihood from making needles.",
                "At that time there did not yet exist a definitely established calendar. Every month messengers were sent out to observe the appearance of the new moon and even though the scholars could calculate the exact moment of the appearance of the moon, it was prohibited to decide on the day of the new month without the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon. On the basis of such testimony Rabban Gamliel once determined the day of the new year and of all the other holidays of the month of Tishri. But even as the witnesses were testifying to having observed the new moon, Rabbi Joshua felt convinced that their testimony was false for according to all possible calculations it was impossible for the new moon to have appeared. Gathering courage Rabbi Joshua told the Nasi that he was wrong in setting the date of the holidays on the basis of such testimony. This opinion was also supported by other scholars but Rabban Gamliel was adamant and refused to alter his decision. He turned to Rabbi Joshua and said: “If you have another calculation of the holidays, then I command you to appear before me carrying your cane and wallet in your hand and your bag on your shoulders on the day which you consider to be the right Day of Atonement.”",
                "Rabbi Joshua was greatly grieved when he heard this, for he was convinced that he was right, and that it was only because of his poverty that the Nasi imposed upon him. Those of the scholars who agreed with him felt likewise. Nevertheless they advised him to do as he was bid for “everyone must obey the Nasi and whatever he says must be considered the law.” The text of the Torah enjoining the observance of the holidays they interpreted in such a manner as to prove that the court may decide on the exact day. They argued furthermore that no one must allow himself the decision of the Nasi he would also criticize the decisions of all the courts since the times of Moses.”",
                "Rabbi Joshua was thus persuaded by his comrades and on the day which according to his calculation was the Day of Atonement, he came to Jabneh carrying his cane, his wallet and his bag. When Rabban Gamliel saw him coming he was overjoyed, he kissed him on the head and said to him: “Come in peace, my teacher and my pupil—my teacher in learnedness and my pupil in obedience.”",
                "But in spite of the apparent reconciliation, a feeling of bitterness rankled in the heart of Rabbi Joshua since this event. He believed that he was humiliated because of his poverty. This occurrence also engendered an unspoken bitterness among other members of the Sanhedrin who resented the arbitrary behavior of their Nasi. But they stifled their opposition until another dispute arose between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua.",
                "One of the pupils came to ask whether the reciting of the evening prayer (<span dir=\"rtl\">מעריב</span>) was obligatory or voluntary. Rabbi Joshua told him that it was voluntary and one could do as he chose. The same pupil then asked this question of Rabban Gamliel who decided that the reciting of the “Maariv” was obligatory. The pupil then asked: “How is it that Rabbi Joshua declared it to be voluntary?” and Rabban Gamliel answered: “Wait until all the scholars come to the academy and we will discuss this matter.”",
                "When all the scholars gathered Rabban Gamliel declared, “I have ordained that the reciting of the evening prayer is obligatory”; saying this he turned to the assembled, “is anyone opposed to this decision?”",
                "“No one is opposed,” Rabbi Joshua answered. Upon hearing this Rabban Gamliel said, “Joshua, stand up and a witness will testify that you have ordered otherwise before.”",
                "Rabbi Joshua obeyed and arose; he stood for a long time before Rabban Gamliel told him to return to his place. The other scholars could no longer tolerate the overbearing attitude of the Nasi; there was an uproar of protest against his conduct and the impeachment of Rabban Gamliel from his office was taken to a vote.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות כ״ז ב׳.</span></i>",
                "When this became known, there appeared hundreds of others whom Rabban Gamliel previously expelled from the academy, and it was necessary to add 300 benches in the academy. Afterward they began to choose another Nasi instead of Rabban Gamliel. When the qualifications of all the candidates were considered it became apparent that Rabbi Joshua could not succeed Rabban Gamliel because the whole commotion arose on his account. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus would have been a likely candidate but he was an angry person and a follower of the school of Shammai. Rabbi Akiba could not be considered because he was not descended from aristocracy; no one knew his origin and it was rumored that he was descended from proselytes. All eyes therefore turned to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, who was the equal of Rabban Gamliel in scholarship; he was also a descendant of an aristocratic priestly family, he possessed great wealth and was recognized by the Roman rulers.",
                "Rabban Gamliel remained impeached for only a short time. It seems that only a few days passed before he was reinstated. The sudden outburst of the scholars against his severe conduct produced such a change in him that everyone was moved to pity. When the scholars saw that the aristocratically reared Rabban Gamliel bowed without complaint before the will of the people and that he did not break with the academy, from the presidency of which he was removed, but immediately adapted himself to his new status and took his place among the other pupils as an equal, they realized that they were overhasty and immediately considered a reconciliation.",
                "Only then was it realized what noble traits Rabban Gamliel possessed. He was terribly humiliated; no one even thought of sparing the honor of the Nasi’s family which derived, through Hillel, from king David; only a day before everyone bowed before him, and suddenly the same people turned against him. Nevertheless he accepted the verdict of the people and did not absent himself from the academy for even one hour, although he fully realized that his situation was a very difficult one, for all his previous decisions would be reconsidered and all of his disciples of the past would attempt to prove them to be wrong.",
                "But instead of dwelling on what happened to him he considered his behavior toward others and realized that he conducted himself too severely. He then went to Rabbi Joshua to ask his forgiveness. When he saw the darkened walls of the low narrow house in which Rabbi Joshua lived, he said, “from the walls of your house one can tell your occupation.” Believing that this was said with the intent to slight him, Rabbi Joshua answered, “Woe to the generation which has a leader like you, for you have no understanding for the suffering of the scholars and you do not know how they gain their livelihood.”",
                "Rabban Gamliel said to him, “Now that I came to you, forgive me! Do so for the sake of the honor of my family.”",
                "Rabbi Joshua was deeply touched at these words and readily became reconciled. Then Rabbi Akiba said to Rabbi Joshua: “We did all this for your sake; tomorrow let us both go to visit Rabban Gamliel.”",
                "When the newly elected Nasi, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, heard this, he declared that he wanted to accompany them to inform Rabban Gamliel of his readiness to resign.",
                "Rabban Gamliel was thus returned to his office and Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was made head of the court. They divided their duties among themselves. Rabban Gamliel expounded the law on two Sabbaths in succession and Rabbi Elazar expounded on the third Sabbath. It seems that since that time Rabban Gamliel interested himself more with the occupations of his pupils. When Rabbi Joshua told him that two of his disciples, Rabbi Elazar Chisma and Rabbi Jochanan ben Gudgada, could calculate the number of drops of water in the sea but could not afford bread to eat or a garment to wear, Rabban Gamliel wanted to give them positions in the academy from which they could earn their livelihood. For some reason they refused these positions.",
                "Peace was thus re-established in the academy of Jabneh and Rabban Gamliel remained Nasi until his death. His later conduct also indicates that he relented some of his severity and if he treated someone more harshly than the occasion deserved, it evoked no protest. Meantime the decrees of Rome became more severe and Rabban Gamliel was frequently compelled to journey to Rome to intercede for the Jews and to effect the revocation of some decree or, at least, to ameliorate its effects. He was often accompanied by some of his comrades on these trips and he was invariably successful in the accomplishment of his mission. His aristocratic bearing and his fluent Greek speech gained for him the confidence of the court and of the highest officials of the empire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי סנהדרין פרק ז׳ הלכה י״ג, דברים רבה פּ׳ ב׳ פּיסקא כ״ד.</span></i>",
                "In his travels he often visited Jerusalem and when he once saw a fox on the site of the Holy of Holies he wept bitterly. This was reported to the Roman authorities who considered it a sign of disloyalty and wanted to have him killed. But a Roman friend of Rabban Gamliel came to the gate of the academy and announced: “The man with the prominent nose is sought.” Rabban Gamliel understood the hint and remained in hiding for some time until a new government came to power.",
                "While Rabban Gamliel was impeached from his office as Nasi, there began a special investigation of all the innovations which he introduced into Jewish life. The scholars gathered testimony from all people who saw or heard of the customs of previous generations. On that day there were adopted many rules on matters that were previously in dispute. In some matters the followers of the school of Hillel decided according to the opinion of the school of Shammai; other laws were given an entirely new interpretation. But no law that was previously disputed was left in doubt on that day.",
                "Two of the laws that were discussed that day throw light on the opinions of the scholars and on their ability to adapt themselves to changed conditions. There is a text in the Torah which says that “an Ammonite or a Moabite may not come in the congregation of the Lord.” But these two nations were no longer in existence at that time and those who were still called by these names were derived from other nations who settled in these lands during the wars and the migration of nations.",
                "On the day that Rabban Gamliel was impeached there arose one of the pupils, Jehudah the Ammonite proselyte, and asked: “What about me? May I mingle with the Jews?” Rabban Gamliel said that he must not, but Rabbi Joshua ruled to the contrary. When Rabban Gamliel insisted on the literal meaning of the text, Rabbi Joshua said to him: “Have the Ammonites and Moabites of old remained in their lands? Has not Sanherib confused the nations of the earth a long time ago?”",
                "The explanation of Rabbi Joshua was accepted by all scholars and they permitted Jehudah, the Ammonite proselyte, to consider himself a Jew.",
                "Another question concerned the inclusion of the Song of Songs and of Ecclesiastes in the Scriptures. The followers of the school of Shammai particularly objected to Ecclesiastes on the ground that the reader may misunderstand its words and may think that it has no religious message. Later Rabbi Akiba declared that there were no differences of opinion regarding the Song of Songs, for “all eternity is worth less than the day on which the Song of Songs was given to the Jews,” but the argument centered solely on Ecclesiastes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our scholars held varying opinions relative to the significance of some of the books of the Scriptures. Particular doubt was expressed regarding the books of Ezekiel, Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes and these were almost excluded from the Scriptures. The cause of these disputes are mentioned in numerous places in the Talmud but nowhere are they described in detail. From these it seems that the book of Ezekiel was objected to because of the description of the Divine Chariot whose mysteries must not be discussed before the uninitiated. The Talmud relates that a child (<span dir=\"rtl\">ינוקא</span>) once pondered the subject of the light of the Divine Chariot and a fire descended from heaven and consumed the child. When the scholars discovered in Ezekiel contradictions to the Torah, one of them, Chanania ben Hiskia, pondered these contradictions so long that he used up three hundred jars of oil before he succeeded in explaining them. Of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes it was said, that they contradicted themselves and several verses in Eccleciastes were held to be deviations in the direction of heresy.</i>",
                "An important regulation of Rabban Gamliel was that relating to the Sabbatical year. According to a previous rule it was prohibited to cultivate the fields even on the sixth year immediately after “Shavuoth.” Rabban Gamliel removed this restriction and permitted cultivation until the New Year. He also stabilized the prayers at three times a day. The exact order of the prayers, which were then accepted as taking the place of sacrifices, was determined in his academy. With the aid of two disciples, Simeon of Pakula and Samuel the Small, the order of “Shemone Esrei” was determined and it was ruled to be the duty of every Jew to recite these three times daily.",
                "The benediction of God as the “builder of Jerusalem” was introduced into the blessings pronounced after eating. Rabban Gamliel also tried to determine the blessings to be pronounced over various kinds of food and, although his comrades did not agree with all of his definitions, he nevertheless consistently clung to his opinions.",
                "The Roman government seems to have realized at that time that it would not subdue the Jewish people unless it could control its spirit. The government then sent two educated Gentiles, who were to pretend conversion, to study the Torah from Rabban Gamliel. The two arrived in Jabneh and studied everything. After they learned what they needed they declared that they were satisfied with the whole Torah except the rule that it is permissible to derive benefit from robbing a Gentile. Rabban Gamliel then ruled to prohibit this, for in doing so one dishonors the Jewish name.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי בבא קמא פרק ד׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> Worthy of mention is also the regulation of Rabban Gamliel that every Jew must explain to his household the significance of Pesach, Matzo and the bitter herbs, else he has not fulfilled the duties of the day.",
                "Rabban Gamliel also introduced a regulation regarding the Samaritans (referred to as Kuthim in the Talmud) whom the scholars tried to isolate from the Jews. After he assumed office Rabban Gamliel sought to amend the laws against the Kuthim out of a belief that it would be possible to bring them closer to other Jews. In the war against Rome the Kuthim sided with the Jews and fought side by side with them unlike the Idumeans who betrayed the Jews and frequently allied themselves with the enemy. The Kuthim were therefore looked upon more favorably, and although it was previously said that “whoever eats the bread of a Kuthi is like one who eats the flesh of a pig,” Rabban Gamliel declared that a divorce that was obtained through the testimony of a Kuthi was valid. He also considered grains bought from Kuthim to be “Demai” in the same manner as were grains bought from an “Am Haaretz.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">״דמאי״</span> are grains or fruits bought from an Am Haaretz concerning which there is doubt whether the tithe has been offered.</i>",
                "Later Rabban Gamliel visited the cities of the Kuthim and he realized that they were not true proselytes and were far from Judaism. He then declared that their produce is “Vadai” (certainly untithed) from which tithes must be offered. He also prohibited Jews to eat meat of their slaughtering.",
                "Rabban Gamliel strongly praised people who have an occupation. Seeing that many Jews will have to leave the soil and turn to trades because of the political situation, he said: “Whoever possesses a trade is certain of his existence, even as one is certain of a vineyard which is surrounded by a fence.”",
                "Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua became reconciled but nothing is known of the outcome of his dispute with his brother-in-law, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus. We know of the excommunication but no mention is made of a reconciliation. The stories of the journeys of Rabban Gamliel frequently mention Rabbi Eliezer as a companion. While this may indicate a reconciliation, there is also another legend which says that the wife of Rabbi Eliezer, the sister of Rabban Gamliel, prohibited her husband from bowing at “Tachnun.” She feared that in doing so he would avenge himself on her brother. But once she forgot to observe him at prayer and he bowed at “Tachnun.” When she saw this she cried out that he had killed her brother. In the same instant Rabban Gamliel died. He was mourned by the whole people who called him “father” and his wife “mother.”"

                "F<small>ROM WHAT WAS RELATED</small> in the previous chapter it is to be seen that Rabbi Eliezer was a man of firm convictions from which he would not deviate in the least. This tenacity caused him much trouble and brought him into conflict with the Nasi in spite of the family relationship which existed between them. He also came into disagreement with his comrades of the academy in Jabneh from which he was removed. Later he left Jabneh for Lud where he led an academy of his own founding and he could no longer return to the meetings of the Sanhedrin.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer was a follower of the school of Shammai in his convictions. He was therefore called “Shamuti.” Since all the other scholars including the Nasi were adherents of the school of Hillel, Rabbi Eliezer was practically ostracized socially. When the question whether it is permissible to use a “winding oven” (<span dir=\"rtl\">תנור של עכנאי</span>) was discussed, Rabbi Eliezer declared in the affirmative while all the others rendered a negative decision. On that day no decision of Rabbi Eliezer was adopted but he refused to reconsider his opinion and it is told that many miraculous events then took place upholding Rabbi Eliezer’s views. A carob tree became uprooted and was flung for a distance of one hundred ells from the place where it grew; a brook suddenly changed the direction of its current; the walls of the academy began to lean and a “Bath Kol” was heard from heaven declaring the correctness of Rabbi Eliezer’s views.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have previously commented on the “Bath Kol.” Regarding the leaning of the walls of the academy in support of Rabbi Eliezer’s view, it is held by some that this was but an imaginative description of what took place.

                "But Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania firmly opposed Rabbi Eliezer and he said that no attention need be paid to the wondrous events. Regarding the “Bath Kol” he declared that the Torah was given for observance on earth and Heaven therefore had no right to interfere in disputes which take place on earth.",
                "Then the scholars burned all those articles which Rabbi Eliezer declared to be clean and they voted on a punishment to be inflicted on Rabbi Eliezer for his stubborness. It was decided that all the scholars should have no dealings with him and Rabbi Akiba was chosen to inform him of the sentence. Rabbi Akiba donned a black garment and sat at a distance of four ells from Rabbi Eliezer. When Rabbi Eliezer asked him: “Why is this day different from all other days?” Rabbi Akiba answered: “Rabbi, I think that your comrades have abandoned you.”",
                "Upon hearing this, Rabbi Eliezer tore his garments, he sat down on the ground and wept bitterly.

He also adopted the good qualities of his master of whom it was said that he never indulged in idle talk, he never walked even a distance of four ells without phylacteries and without studying the Torah, and he was the first to arrive at the academy and the last to leave. Although R. Eliezer conducted his own academy even before the destruction of Jerusalem, he never proclaimed opinions which he had not heard from his master.

But despite this family relationship Rabbi Eliezer frequently conflicted with the Nasi and with his colleagues. All of them became opposed to him and the harmony of the academy was disrupted.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer was sometimes referred to as Rabbi Eliezer the Great, but wherever reference is made to R. Eliezer, without any other title, he was the person referred to. Among his disciples there was also Rabbi Akiba who, even after he attained the greatest position of leadership, never refrained from mentioning that he was a pupil of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Eliezer was also versed in the languages of the neighboring peoples and several times he accompanied Rabban Gamliel on the latter’s trips to Rome to plead the cause of the Jews.",
                "Of the manner in which Rabbi Eliezer turned to learning it is told that his father was a wealthy man who owned many fields. The father together with the sons devoted themselves to the cultivation of the land and all of them were rude people, “Ame Arotzim,” who could not even recite the “Shema.” When he was over twenty years old, Rabbi Eliezer suddenly decided to leave the fields and to turn to study. He told his plan to his father and old Hyrcanus laughed at him and said: “Now you wish to study? Now it is time for you to take a wife and to beget children, then you can raise your children in the knowledge of the Torah.” But Rabbi Eliezer would not hear of this and decided to leave his father’s house at the earliest opportunity. When a cow, with which he was plowing, broke a leg he was afraid of his father’s punishment and fled to Jerusalem to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.",

Out of pity Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai permitted him to come to his academy even though he was so ignorant. But great was the astonishment of all when they saw his rapid progress. Having fled from his father’s house bare handed, Rabbi Eliezer had no money with which to buy food. In great hunger he began to chew earth and this caused his breath to become spoiled. Rabban Jochanan then questioned him regarding his origin and why he fled from his father’s house. When Rabbi Eliezer told him all, Rabban Jochanan provided him with food and seeing his great desire to learn he befriended him. Within three years Rabbi Eliezer became the outstanding pupil of Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer’s father meanwhile met with difficulties and lost all his possessions. When he regained them after some time he learned that Rabbi Eliezer was engaged in studies in Jerusalem. Hyrcanus was then an old man and his sons said to him: “See what your son Eliezer did for you. When you were in difficulty he left you and went to Jerusalem to live in luxury, but when the inheritance will be divided he will take his share together with the rest of us. Even if you will write a will disowning him, it will not be heeded, for his master, Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai, will rule in his favor.”",

But now that I see how all the scholars revere him I will assign to him in my will a portion double that of his brothers.” To this Rabbi Eliezer replied that he never prayed for fields or for silver and gold but only for the knowledge of the Torah and he therefore refused to take a greater share of the inheritance than his brothers would receive.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ו׳ משנה ג׳, מדרש תנחומא פּ׳ לך לך.</span></i>",
                "Rabbi Eliezer was by nature of a stubborn and harsh disposition as befits a person who would be a follower of Shammai. He did not allow his pupils to express their opinions of the law in his presence. When one of them once did so, Rabbi Eliezer remarked to his wife: “I will not be surprised if this person does not survive a year.” Later it so happened and that person died within the year. Rabbi Eliezer’s wife then asked him: “Are you a prophet that you could foretell his death?” but he replied, “I am not a prophet nor am I the son of a prophet, but I have received it from my teacher that one who pronounces sentence in the presence of his master has forfeited his life.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין ס״ג א׳.</span></i>",

                "“Then why did you never come to me before?” he asked them, and they said, “We never had the time.” “Seeing that you never found the time to visit me till now,” he continued, “I would not be surprised if you meet with violent deaths.”",
                "Rabbi Akiba then asked him, “I too?” and Rabbi Eliezer answered: “Your death will be more cruel than theirs.”",
                "From this one can see that he never forgave any slight to his self-respect and it was also known that he never went out of his way to show kindness.",
                "It is told that once Rabbi Eliezer approached the “Amud” (the pulpit of the cantor) to pray for rain and although he pronounced 24 blessings there was no rain. Later Rabbi Akiba rose and merely said: “Our Father, our king. We have no other king but You. Our Father, our king, do for Your own sake and have mercy on us.” A rain immediately began to fall. The scholars were displeased at this and a “Bath Kol” from heaven was heard saying: “Rabbi Akiba is not greater than Rabbi Eliezer, but Rabbi Akiba practices forgiveness and Rabbi Eliezer does not.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תענית כ״ה ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Of Rabbi Eliezer’s moral maxims there remain the following sentences: “Let the honor of your friend be dear to you as your own; be not quick to anger and repent a day before your death; warm yourself at the fire of the wise and beware of their glowing coal lest you be scorched, for their bite is the bite of a fox and their sting is the sting of a scorpion, their hiss is the hiss of a serpent and all their words are like coals of fire.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אבות פרק ב׳ משנה י׳.</span></i>",

                "As soon as he died Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania arose and declared: “Now the vow is rescinded.” Since the scholars vowed during the dispute with Rabbi Eliezer not to approach him within a distance of four ells, they considered this vow no longer valid after his death.",
                "From this statement one may conclude that Rabbi Eliezer was not excommunicated but was merely isolated by a vow of the scholars, else he would not have been allowed to conduct a separate academy and the pupils of that academy would not have ranked with those of Jabneh, and when Rabban Gamliel died, Rabbi Eliezer sent all the pupils of his academy from Lud to Jabneh to participate in the funeral and the mourning.",
                "When Rabbi Akiba heard of the death of Rabbi Eliezer he came all the way from Caesarea to Lud to attend the funeral; on his way he was flogging himself and when he arrived his whole body was bleeding. Later Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania came to the academy of Rabbi Eliezer and there he found a stone on which Rabbi Eliezer was in the habit of sitting while he taught. Seeing this stone Rabbi Joshua kissed it and said: “This stone is like mount Sinai and he who sat on it can be compared to the Ark of the Covenant.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה א׳ פּסקא ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Idolatry presented a very serious problem at that time. Since the temple was destroyed and the sacrifices were done away with, there were many Jews who felt that God had abandoned his people and they therefore turned to other gods. Rabbi Eliezer furiously fought against these deserters and he believed that it was necessary to uproot this evil. If a book of the Torah is found in a house of idol worshipping, he ruled that such a book must be burned since it is against the law to throw it away and because it became contaminated it could no longer be used.",
                "Although Rabbi Eliezer was away from Jabneh for many years, there are many decisions of law quoted in his name as well as many legends about him. He was also praised as possessing the same qualities which were ascribed to his teacher Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai. During the sickness that preceded his death he was visited by four of the elders of the people: Rabbi Tarphon, Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and Rabbi Akiba.",
                "Rabbi Tarphon said: “You were better for the Jews than rain.” Rabbi Joshua said: “You were better for the Jews than sun.” Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said: “You were better for the Jews than parents are for their children.” When Rabbi Akiba was ready to speak Rabbi Eliezer cupped his ear and said to those present: “Let us hear what Rabbi Akiba has to say of me.” But Rabbi Akiba said: “The dearest thing on earth is suffering.”",
                "Then there came Rabbi Eliezer’s disciples and he said: “A great wrath has descended upon the world.” All the disciples began to weep, only Rabbi Akiba smiled. The disciples said: “Is it possible to refrain from weeping when one sees the Torah in suffering?” But Rabbi Akiba answered: “That is the reason why I laugh. Were my master not to suffer, it would seem that he has received the reward for his good deeds in this world. But since he suffers I am convinced that the reward for his good deeds is awaiting him and that he will receive it in the other world.”",
                "Rabbi Eliezer was especially famous for the exactness of his knowledge which he received from his teacher. He often said that a person must study every subject with his pupil four times even as was done by the Jews when they were in the desert, for all the Jews learned from the Elders and the Elders learned from Aaron and Aaron learned from Moses and Moses learned the Torah from God. Study of the Torah is of such importance that one must not abstain from it at any time. Even the holidays must be devoted to this end, for only an “Am Haaretz” devotes his holidays to earthly pleasures, but a scholar must continue his studies; when one indulges in food and drink on a feast day it is only to the end that he may have more strength to devote to the Torah.",
                "Of the significance of Rabbi Eliezer’s learning, Elisha ben Avuya once told that on the day of his <span dir=\"rtl\">ברית מילה</span> his father prepared a feast and invited all the outstanding people of that time including Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua. After the food and drink, those gathered sang various songs and played a game of Alphabet. One would recite a verse of the Bible beginning with an Aleph and another immediately answered with a verse beginning with a Beth. Rabbi Eliezer then said to Rabbi Joshua: “While these people devote themselves to their affairs let us devote ourselves to ours.” They began to discuss various interpretations of the Torah and they derived as much joy from it as if the Torah had only then been handed down from Mount Sinai. A cloud of fire then descended from heaven and surrounded them. Elisha’s father said to them: “What are you doing? Would you burn my house?”, but they replied, “We devoted ourselves to finding new interpretations to the Torah which was given in fire.” Then said Avuya: “If the power of the Torah is so great I shall devote my son to it when he grows to be of age.”",
                "Rabbi Eliezer held original ideas regarding the value of prayer. “Whoever prays at well defined times and according to a determined form,” he used to say, “his prayer is only a habit and does not derive from his heart.” Contrary to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, he did not recognize the necessity of reciting the “Shmone Esrei” and he composed a shorter prayer. When one of the pupils once prayed before the pulpit and said the shorter prayers, his colleagues laughed at him but Rabbi Eliezer said: “Abbreviated as his prayer is, it is not as short as the prayer which Moses uttered for the cure of his sister which consisted of only five words.” Another time a pupil recited a long version of the prayers and he was ridiculed for their length, but Rabbia Eliezer said: “His prayers are no longer than those of Moses who prayed for forty days.” Then he continued: “There is a time for abbreviating one’s prayers and a time for extending them. The important thing is to recite the prayer according to the need of the time.”",
                "Speaking of the same subject on another occasion he gave his interpretation of the words of God who said to Moses: “Why do you pray to me? Tell the Jews that they should advance.” According to Rabbi Eliezer God meant to say: “My children are in trouble. The sea has cut off their escape and the enemy is overtaking them. At such a time one must think of a means of salvation and not devote himself to prayer. Therefore tell the Jews to advance in spite of all obstacles.”",
                "Like all his contemporaries, Rabbi Eliezer deeply mourned the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple which he witnessed. He said: “Our forefathers permitted the roof of our sanctuary to be taken away while we allowed the walls to be razed. Every generation which does not see the temple rebuilt is like a generation which participates in its destruction.” He also said that three times every night God sits in mourning and roars like a lion over the ruins of the temple exclaiming: “Woe is me that I have destroyed my house and have exiled my children.”",
                "At that time there prevailed a strong proselyting mood among the nations surrounding Palestine. Despite the fact that the Jews had lost all political significance, many Gentiles felt drawn toward the Jewish faith, intrigued by the stubbornness with which the Jews clung to it. Not a ray of light illuminated Jewish life and proselytes were being discouraged. Before one was admitted to the fold he would be asked: “Do you not know that Jews are persecuted everywhere? It is also very difficult to observe Judaism, especially for one who is not used to its rigors.” But there were many Gentiles who were not discouraged and even among the highest classes of Rome there were some who embraced Judaism. It therefore became necessary to devise new regulations for the new Jews. Before the temple was destroyed, Gentiles who undertook to observe the “seven commandments of the sons of Noah” were allowed to live in Judea and they were called “permanent proselytes” <span dir=\"rtl\">(גר תושב).</span> But after the destruction only those were accepted as proselytes who undertook to observe Judaism in all its details. The Roman historian Tacitus ridiculed the proselytes and said: “It is impossible to comprehend what happened to many prominent Romans that they suddenly became filled with Jewish thoughts and agreed to have their flesh cut and to deny the gods of their forefathers.” The emperor Domitian then issued severe laws against those Gentiles who embraced Judaism and the Roman satirist Juvenal used his sharp wit against those who teach their children the belief in a God who is all spirit, whom no one has seen and who is not strong enough to protect his people and who is therefore concerned only that people should observe the Sabbath and should not eat pork.",
                "One of these proselytes was a rich Roman matron named Bloria, who was well versed in the Scriptures and frequently addressed questions to Rabban Gamliel and to his disciples. Another proselyte was Aquilas (Onkelos), a scion of the imperial family who translated the Torah into Greek because the Septuagint version was by then imperfect because of falsification of its contents. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua approved this translation and an Aramaic version of it we possess to this day under the name of “Targum Onkelos.”",
                "But despite such outstanding examples, Rabbi Eliezer did not approve of all proselytes and he maintained that there always existed a possibility that a proselyte would return to the Gentiles. When Rabbi Eliezer saw the suffering which the proselytes had to withstand at the hands of the Roman law he said: “Why is it that proselytes of this day are persecuted and have to suffer so much? This is probably because they do not show love for Judaism but only possess an unexplained fear.”",
                "When Rabbi Eliezer declared that a man must repent a day before his death, his disciples asked him: “How can one know what day he will die on?” “That was exactly my intention,” Rabbi Eliezer answered, “that one should repent every day for fear that he will die on the morrow.”",
                "Rabbi Eliezer considered a sword, a lance and a bow as decorations which a man may keep when going about on the Sabbath. He opposed teaching the Torah to girls and declared that whoever teaches the Torah to his daughter is like one who teaches his daughter foolish things. Wild beasts, he said, should be killed wherever met as against the opinion of the other scholars who believed that a wild beast should be killed only if it has done some harm. He also said that whoever eats the bread of a Gentile is like one who eats the flesh of a pig.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer always elaborated on the events related in the Torah and, with poetic imagination, he embellished these events with wonders even greater than those which are described in the Torah. Of the ten plagues which, according to the Torah, were visited on Egypt before the deliverance of the Jews, Rabbi Jose of Galilee said that they prove that the Egyptians were afflicted with fifty plagues when pursuing the Jews to the sea. He bases it on the verse of the Torah which says that the ten plagues were a “finger of God” but when by the sea “the Jews saw the great hand of God”; consequently, if one finger caused ten plagues, the hand of God must have caused fifty. But Rabbi Eliezer was still unsatisfied and he discovered a text which proved that every plague consisted of four; he therefore concluded that the Egyptians were afflicted with forty plagues in Egypt and with as many as two hundred plagues by the sea.",
                "He also said that the miraculous events which transpired by the sea were so great that even women slaves saw more than Ezekiel and all the other prophets. Moses’ song of praise which said, “this is my God and I shall glorify Him,” he considered as proof that every one saw God in person.",
                "Concerning the Manna Rabbi Eliezer said that when it fell it remained suspended two ells above the ground and the Jews picked it from the air and not from the ground. Before it fell, Rabbi Eliezer said, a North wind would arise and cleanse the desert of sand; then a rain would descend to wash the earth; after the rain a dew would fall and spread like a cloth and on it the Manna descended.",
                "Regarding the events at Mount Sinai the text of the Torah says that “all Jews saw.” Rabbi Eliezer declared this to indicate that there was not a blind man among all the people. When it is said later that everyone answered in unison, he interpreted it to signify that there was not a mute person in all the people; from the declaration of the Jews that they will do and hear as they are told, he concluded that there was not a deaf person among them and the verse which says that all the people stood at the foot of the mountain he interpreted to indicate that there was not a lame one among them.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer greatly esteemed the worth of the Sabbath. He declared that whoever observes the Sabbath according to all the regulations will be spared three types of punishment—such a person will be spared the sufferings of the coming of the Messiah, the wars of Gog and Magog and the great “Day of Judgment.”",
                "Concerning the duty to honor one’s father, Rabbi Eliezer related a story of a Gentile named Dama ben Nathina who possessed a diamond worth 600,000 shkolim which he wanted to sell for the “Ephod” of the High Priest. But when the priests came to buy it, Dama’s father was asleep and the key to the box which contained the diamond was under his pillow. Dama refused to waken his father even though this caused him a great loss. On another occasion Rabbi Eliezer said that the honor due to one’s father must be so unbounded that even were one to see his father throw a bag of gold into the sea, he must not question his action."

Rabban Jochanan himself referred to him as “the triple thread” because he combined within himself the virtues of Torah, wisdom and fear of God; on another occasion Rabban Jochanan is said to have exclaimed: “Happy is the mother who gives birth to such a son.” Rabbi Joshua’s mother well deserved this praise, for even before his birth she frequented the academies in order to influence the future of the child which she bore within herself with the spirit of the Torah.

On the morning of the first day of Succoth everybody arose early to offer the daily morning sacrifice, then the Levites sang a hymn after which it was time to offer the special holiday sacrifice. Following this all went to the academy and then home to partake of the holiday repast, but before that could be consumed it was time again for the “Mincha” offering and then began the festivities of the drawing of water which passed in rejoicing and dancing until the early hours of the morning when it was time again for the morning sacrifice.

                "To this Rabbi Joshua replied: “You are quite right, my children. But if we should do as you say then we must also give up eating bread which is made out of flour, for flour is no longer offered on the altar; and if you will say that one can do without flour by eating fruit then must we also give up eating fruit, for the offering of the first fruit to the priest has been done away with; we should also give up drinking water because it is no longer poured over the altar.”",

It is necessary to mourn in such a manner that everyone should be able to bear it and that the mourning should not interfere with people’s lives.”",

Some would have it that <span dir=\"rtl\">״אבידן״</span> is an erroneous form of <span dir=\"rtl\">״אביון״</span> and that the disputes were with the Christians who were then called “Ebionim.” Others say it is the name of a Persian sect and the disputes were held with Persians.</i> The aim of these was to dissuade Jews from their faith. Rabbi Joshua attended these a number of times but later he stopped going. When the emperor once came to the disputing ground and did not find Rabbi Joshua there he later asked him why he was absent. In his usual allegorical fashion Rabbi Joshua answered him: “My mountain is already covered with snow and the foot of the mountain is bedecked with ice. My dogs no longer bark, nor do my grindstones turn, and when I walk it seems as if I search for that which I have not lost.” With these words Rabbi Joshua implied that he feels his age; his head is white as snow and his beard and moustache are grey as ice; his voice is hoarse and he has difficulty in speaking; his teeth can no longer chew and when he walks he is bent as if in search of something.",

This permission is said to have been obtained by Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. But the emperor later changed his mind and rescinded his permission. Some historians maintain that the intervention of the Samaritans was responsible for this but others advance different reasons. The rescinding of this permission almost caused a new uprising but Rabbi Joshua calmed the enraged mob with an allegoric tale.",

He therefore announced throughout the land that whoever will remove the bone will be richly rewarded. The stork came and with its long bill it extracted the bone. When the stork demanded its reward the lion said to it: ‘You want reward? Is it not enough for you that you have been within the mouth of the lion and you have come out alive?’”",

Speaking of the disputes between the opposing schools of Hillel and Shammai he said that these were being carried too far and were like “filling a barrel full of oil and then pouring water into it to spoil the oil.”",
                "Following the death of Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Joshua apparently became the spiritual leader of the people. It is possible that because of his poverty he was not chosen Nasi, but since he headed his own academy in Pekiin and the Nasi of Jabneh was dead we may conclude that his importance was then of the highest.",

This period was therefore marked by constant decrees against the Jews and it was necessary to intercede continually in order to counteract their effects and also to keep a vigilant eye on what was going on among the Jews among whom rebellious moods began to rise as a result of these decrees.",

                "The belief was then accepted that every Jew is entitled to a share in the world to come and in the resurrection after he will pass the great Day of Judgment which will occur during the next redemption of the Jewish people. This belief grew out of observation that the fulfillment of some commandments, which is to be rewarded with long life, often entailed the immediate death of the observant.",

Then many people asked: “How could God do this since he promised in the Torah that these two commandments were to be rewarded with long life?” It was then explained that the reward was to be given in the future life and the text was interpreted to mean, “you shall enjoy this world which is perfect without pain and you shall live long years in the world which is eternal.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">קדושין ל״ט ב׳, חולין קמ״ב א׳.</span></i>",

Non-Jews, he said, were not even to be called for the Day of Judgment; but Rabbi Joshua maintained that the just men among the Gentiles would have a share in the world to come. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the people of Sodom, the generation of desert wanderers and the congregation of Korah were to be excluded from the resurrection and from the Day of Judgment but Rabbi Joshua was more generous to these sinners and although he conceded that they were ruled out from the world to come he claimed that they would be called to the Judgment Day.",
                "A saying of Rabbi Joshua which he frequently repeated stated that an evil eye, an evil thought and hatred of mankind drive a man out of the world. He particularly believed in the importance of peaceful relations between people and he also said that “a pious fool, a clever wicked man, an abstaining woman and the plague of Pharisaism—these four types spoil the world.” It was asked, what is a pious fool? The answer was given that a pious fool is one who sees a woman drowning and would not save her for fear of touching her body. A pious fool was also one who sees a child drowning and does not save it because he has not yet removed his phylacteries. An abstaining woman was defined as one who renounces her husband and the joys of the world; the plague of Pharisaism was explained to mean such Pharisees who strike their heads against a wall to show their piety.",

Or those slaughtered by Nebuchadnezzar? Or the bodies of those killed in all the wars that took place to this day?

Nevertheless they contain an important religious significance. The Elders of Athens, it is told, once asked Rabbi Joshua: “Where is the middle of the world?” Pointing to the place where he stood, Rabbi Joshua declared it to be the middle of the world, and when they asked him how he knew this, he told them to take a line and measure the distance to convince themselves. Attempting to confuse him the Elders said to him: “We have a well in the desert and we want you to bring it into the city.” But Rabbi Joshua said: “For that I need a rope of bran, for only such a rope can be used for moving wells.”",
                "Again they said to him: “We have a torn mill and we want you to patch it,” but he answered that for this a thread of sand was needed. The Elders then asked him: “What should one use to cut a labyrinth of knives?” and he replied: “With the horn of a donkey.” Once two eggs were brought to Rabbi Joshua and he was asked which egg was laid by a white hen and which by a black one. Another time the Elders of Athens said to him: “When a bird dies, where does its soul leave it?” and Rabbi Joshua replied: “The soul leaves through the same place that it enters at birth.” And when they asked: “Is there a case of something being brought into a house with great effort and the effort should cause damage?” he said, “When you bring a rug into the house and in doing so you break the door.”",
                "To the debates between Rabbi Joshua and Hadrian the following may be added. Hadrian said: “You say that God creates new angels every day to praise him and after they finish their praise they go away; I would like to know whither they go.” And Rabbi Joshua answered, “They go to the place where they were created. They go to the River of Fire which flows day and night even as the Jordan flows day and night, and this River of Fire comes from the perspiration of the sacred animals which carry the throne of Glory.”",
                "Then Hadrian said: “I have noticed that God’s name is mentioned in the first five of the Ten Commandments but it does not occur in the other five. How can you explain that?” Rabbi Joshua retorted: “Why is it, that wherever one looks he sees your statue, but in those places where a person goes to relieve himself he does not find your statue?” The emperor answered, “It is not fitting to place my image in unclean places.” “Neither is it fitting to mention God’s name together with murderers, adulterers, thieves, false witnesses and other sinners who are the refuse of humanity,” Rabbi Joshua replied.",
                "Once Hadrian said to Rabbi Joshua: “I would believe in your God if you would only show him to me that I might know Him better.” “I can do that easily,” Rabbi Joshua said, “If you would see my God I will show him to you.” He then led the emperor outside on a hot summer day and told him to look at the sun, but the latter declared that he could not do so, for the sun blinds his eyes.

You probably remembered that yesterday and the day before you left no “Peah”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Peah was set aside from the food eaten from plates as well as from the grain in the fields.

                "“A little girl confounded me,” Joshua continued to relate, “when I was once going on my way and I had to cross a field. The little girl asked me: ‘Rabbi, is not this a field that you allow yourself to walk on it?’ But I said, it is a worn road. She said to me, “If this be a worn road then wicked people like you have made it so.’”",

I asked the boy which way I should go to arrive at the city and he replied, ‘One way is shorter but longer, the other way is longer but shorter.’ I followed the road which the boy said was shorter but longer.

                "Rabbi Eliezer was a native of the town of Modiin, which was also the birthplace of Mattathias the Hasmonean. According to a legend he died as a result of being booted by Bar Kochba, when the latter was told that Rabbi Eliezer sided with the Romans. The period was marked by revolutionary unrest not only among the Jews, but also among all the Asiatic nations which were dominated by Rome and moves toward national liberation were afoot everywhere. In an attempt to gain the confidence of the Jews and their assistance against the other nations, Hadrian permitted the restoration of the temple. The historical occurrences of that time are not entirely clear. One thing is certain, since it appears in all historical records, that after a revolutionary clash with the Romans, Hadrian came to new terms with the Jews and that the outstanding condition of this peace was the permission to rebuild the temple.",
                "But this permission he later rescinded when he abandoned his friendly attitude toward the Jews. By means of various legal amendments, the previous edict allowing the restoration of the temple was made to naught. The first move was to order the selection of a new site for the temple, later an alteration of the dimensions, to differ from those of the old temple, was ordered and the least possible number of Jews were to be employed in the work of reconstruction. When all the imperial caprices were finally complied with and work began, flames appeared from under ground and frightened the laborers away. This phenomenon, which was caused by an accumulation of gases in the ruins since the time of destruction, was interpreted as a sign of God against the work.",
                "The conduct of the emperor enraged the populace and the rebellious sentiments which were seething beneath the surface broke out in the form of open revolt. Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania at first restrained the revolutionary outburst for a time, but when Rabbi Akiba became the spokesman for the revolt, it burst out in full force under the leadership of Simeon ben Kochab of Kezib.",
                "It remains uncertain whether any other scholar besides Rabbi Akiba joined Bar Kochba, but we do know that Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin, who was an uncle of Bar Kochba, opposed the rebellion of the Jews. As long as the war of rebellion lasted, Rabbi Eliezer fasted and prayed that God should save the remnant of the Jews from extermination. Since everyone was convinced of the invincibility of the Romans, Rabbi Eliezer refused to sanction the warlike efforts of his nephew. This was interpreted as indicating sympathy with the Romans and in an outburst of anger Bar Kochba once booted Rabbi Eliezer who instantly died from the blow.",
                "The story of the details of this occurrence relates that Rabbi Eliezer was standing deeply immersed in prayer, when a Samaritan came up to him and whispered something in his ear, but Rabbi Eliezer did not even notice his presence.

                "Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin was a pupil and a friend of Rabban Gamliel II. It seems probable that he also conducted an academy of his own, but since he was an authority on the Hagadah, he was frequently invited to Jabneh to offer his interpretations.

                "Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin devoted himself largely to preaching; he also said that the meaning of the word “Hagadah” was the same as “flowing,” for the legendary interpretations of the historical events and of the texts of the Scriptures flow into one’s consciousness like water. When he preached, his words caressed the ears of the listeners with a gentle grace which aroused the noblest feelings and he stimulated the fantasy of his listeners with poetic imagery.",

                "This maxim characterizes his trend of thoughts and was probably also meant as a condemnation of the various sects which appeared at that time and which profaned the Sabbath, desecrated the festivals, broke the covenant of Abraham and falsely interpreted the Torah. Like most of his contemporaries, Rabbi Eliezer also considered the observance of the Sabbath as the most important element of the Jewish faith. “He who does not observe the Sabbath has no portion in the world to come,” Rabbi Eliezer said, but if the Jews were to observe the Sabbath as it should be observed, God would bestow upon them the following six gifts: the land of Israel, the world to come, a new world order, the re-establishment of the kingdom of David, the priesthood and the Levites.",
                "The developing sects among the Jews at that time began to criticize the Hebrew script. We already described before, that the Jews had two types of script, the square Assyrian and the Phoenician which was used by the Samaritans. In the attempt to isolate the Samaritans from the Jews, Ezra the Scribe selected the Assyrian script to be used exclusively by the Jews. The opponents of the Torah then began to criticize this script saying that it is derived from a foreign nation.

He awaited a redemption which should be characterized by miracles and he held that one must hope for it but must not attempt to hasten such a redemption violently. When he was asked regarding the prophecy that Jerusalem shall become the gathering place of all the nations, how it would be possible for one city to contain all the nations, he explained that God would command the city to extend its boundaries to include all people.",
                "The trend of thoughts of Rabbi Eliezer was illustrated by his saying that the book and the sword were handed down from heaven at the same time. God said: “If you observe the Torah, you will be spared from the sword, but if you will not observe its commandments you shall be destroyed by the sword.” Rabbi Eliezer frequently debated the meaning of various texts of the Torah with Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and he loved to find hidden meaning whenever the wording of a text was unusual, or there was a superfluous word or some word was lacking. Rabbi Joshua, on the contrary, sought the simple meaning of texts and attempted to find a rational explanation.",

They then gathered to Balaam and asked him: “Is this not a repetition of the flood?” But Balaam answered: “Foolish people. God swore to Noah long ago never again to bring a flood.” “Possibly He meant that He would never cause a flood of water to devastate the earth, but He may bring a flood of fire,” they continued asking. Balaam reassured them, “He will bring no flood either of fire or water.

One of these was Onkelos the son of Kalonymos, or Aquilas, as he is referred to in some places, who was closely related to the emperor Hadrian.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The name Aquilas closely resembles Onkelos in the Palestinian pronounciation. The “Ain” is pronounced as a nasal sound and resembles a “Nun.” The stories related in the Talmud and Midrashim regarding Onkelos are substantially the same as those told in other places regarding Aquilas. The main difference is in that the Babylonian Talmud relates Onkelos to Titus and Rabban Gamliel the elder, which would indicate that he lived at the time of the destruction of the temple, while Aquilas is connected with Hadrian and Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh which would indicate that he lived after the destruction. Some historians are therefore of the opinion that Onkelos and Aquilas are two different persons. But the Gaon of Vilna believed that they were the same person and he corrected (<span dir=\"rtl\">גטין נ״ו</span>) to read: “the son of the sister of Hadrian” instead of “the son of the sister of Titus.”</i>",

(Others say that he was brought to this conviction by a Jewish girl.) But he feared his uncle and once he said to him: “I would gladly engage in commerce.” Hadrian replied, “If you lack money, my treasury is always at your disposal.” But Aquilas continued, “I want to journey throughout the world and to meet many men, I therefore want your advice as to what merchandise I shall take.” To this Hadrian replied: “If you see merchandise which is fallen in price, deal in it, for it will surely rise again and you will gain thereby.”",
                "Aquilas then went to Palestine and began to study with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Sometime later he returned to Hadrian and his uncle asked him: “Why is your face so changed? It is obvious that you have suffered losses; or has someone done you harm?” But Aquilas-Onkelos answered, “Neither.”",
                "Then Hadrian said, “You are my kin and I am pained at your poor appearance,” and Aquilas-Onkelos declared, “I have learned the Jewish Torah and I have become a Jew.”",
                "Greatly shocked Hadrian exclaimed, “Who permitted you to do so?” Aquilas-Onkelos answered, “You told me to do so. When I asked your advice what merchandise I should trade in, you told me to get all merchandise which is depreciated, for it would surely rise in value again. I searched among all nations for a people which had fallen lower than the Jews but I found none. I therefore bethought myself that they are sure to rise to heights again.”",
                "This conversation was witnessed by one of the emperor’s ministers who praised Aquilas’ step. The emperor was angered at this and struck his minister. Out of shame that minister leaped from the roof of his house and killed himself.",
                "Hadrian persisted in trying to find out the cause of Aquilas-Onkelos’ conversion until the latter told him, “I wanted to know the Jewish Torah.” “But you could have learned it without embracing Judaism,” the emperor wondered, but Aquilas-Onkelos replied that a non-Jew can never comprehend the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מדרש תנחומא פּרשת משפּטים.</span></i>",
                "There are several versions regarding the conversion and one of them relates that when the emperor heard of it he sent a few soldiers to bring Aquilas back to Rome, but he explained to them a number of verses of the Torah and they too were converted. The emperor then sent other soldiers to bring him back and commanded them not to engage in any discussion with him. When the soldiers took Aquilas-Onkelos and were ready to leave, he said to them: “Let me tell you one thing; among people it customary that the one of lesser rank lights the way for those of higher rank, but my God is the greatest and still he lights the way that people may see where to go.” Upon hearing this, these soldiers too became converted. The emperor then sent soldiers for the third time and commanded them neither to speak nor to listen to what Onkelos may tell them. As they were emerging from the house with him, he placed his hand upon the Mezuzah and said to them: “See the difference between a human ruler and the great God of Israel. A human ruler stays within his house and his guards stay at the gate, but here the people stay inside the house while the king stays at the door to guard them.” Hearing this these soldiers also became converted and the emperor sent no more soldiers to bring Onkelos back.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">עבודה זרה י״א, א׳.</span></i>",

Instead of drawing a parallel between an idol, which the king worshipped, and God, as the author of the Psalms did, it became customary at that time to compare the conduct of a human ruler with that of God.",

With the aid of witchcraft he had Titus aroused from his grave and he asked him: “Which is the worthiest people on earth?”, Titus replied, “The Jews are.” Onkelos then asked, “What would happen if I were to join them?” and Titus said, “Their teachings are too great and it is impossible to observe them.

To him God offers it as a gift, is not that enough?” But this answer did not satisfy Onkelos and he asked the same question of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. Rabbi Joshua responded kindly and said: “The bread which God offers to the proselyte is not ordinary bread but the Torah. And when it is said that God will give the proselyte a garment to wear, no ordinary garment is meant but the Talith of wisdom. If the proselyte is worthy enough to learn the Torah he deserves the Talith of a scholar and he may marry his daughter to a priest and her sons may become High Priests.” Later the scholars said that if Rabbi Joshua had not spoken so kindly to Onkelos he would probably have returned to the Gentiles.",
                "In later years it was told of Onkelos that when he praised the virtues of God he said that even at the creation of the world God showed that his way was different from that of human rulers. A human ruler generally allows his goodness to be praised before he has achieved anything and before he has established courts or built public baths. His name is mentioned before his deeds. But of God the deeds are mentioned first and only then follows the praise.",
                "According to the Christian Church-fathers, Onkelos was an adherent of Christianity first and Hadrian sent him as the representative of the government to Jerusalem where new decrees were then issued almost daily. At first the Jews were permitted to restore the temple, later it was commanded to convert the city to pagan purposes and its name was changed to “Aelia Capitolina” in honor of the Roman god Jupiter. But since Onkelos devoted himself to astrology, which the Christians considered as sinful, he was disowned by them and he turned to Judaism.",
                "For those Jews who lived in the Greek speaking countries and did not know Hebrew but who wanted to acquaint themselves with the content of the Torah, there then existed a Greek translation of the Bible which was known as the “Septuaginta” or the translation of the seventy. But by that time this translation was considerably falsified and it included incorrect interpretations of various Biblical texts. Onkelos-Aquilas undertook to make a new translation which he accomplished with the consent of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania. They later characterized it as an introduction of the beauty of Japheth (Greece) into the tents of Shem.",
                "According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Aquilas was a colleague or a pupil of Rabbi Akiba, and he is said to have sanctioned the new translation of the Bible into Greek. Onkelos’ translation of the Bible became accepted among all the scholars and the Jerusalem Talmud quotes tens of words as Onkelos translated them in order to establish the meaning of various verses. It is also told that as a recognition of his authority in explaining the Bible, Hadrian consulted Onkelos in elucidating a certain text.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי חגיגה פרק ב׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>",
                "Today we possess an Aramaic version of Onkelos’ Greek translation (Targum Onkelos) which has become sanctified almost to the same degree as the Hebrew Bible text. When the Christian Church-father Hieronymus later translated the Bible into Latin he extensively used Onkelos’ Greek translation. Commenting on it he said that it was a poor translation because “the translator slavishly followed the Hebrew text and translated literally without taking into consideration the Greek language and its syntax.” The Jews adopted the translation of Onkelos, Hieronymus said, and some Jewish communities which employed Greek as the spoken language read Onkelos’ translation on the Sabbath instead of the Hebrew text of the Torah or they read both versions.",
                "Onkelos’ conversion apparently occurred after the destruction of Jerusalem during the time that Rabban Gamliel II was Nasi, for Onkelos is frequently mentioned together with Rabban Gamliel. Thus it is told that they were both in Ascalon and Rabban Gamliel performed his ablutions in an ordinary bath house. But since Ascalon was considered to be outside the boundaries of the Land of Israel, Onkelos considered an ordinary bath house there to be unclean and he bathed in the sea instead.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תוספתא מקואות פרק ו׳.</span></i>",

When he was asked by the scholars why he did so, he replied, “In my eyes Rabban Gamliel was more important than a hundred Roman kings.”",
                "Aquilas-Onkelos was very pious and although the temple no longer existed he observed all the regulations of cleanliness which pious Jews observed when the temple was still in existence. When Aquilas-Onkelos inherited the wealth of his father he refused to derive any benefit from the golden and silver idols and cast them into the Dead Sea.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תוספתא דמאי פרק ו׳.</span></i>"

                "F<small>ROM WHAT WAS SAID</small> in the previous chapters it is to be seen that the material position of the Jews continually deteriorated due to the political circumstances. The Roman officials oppressed and persecuted the population to the limit of their ability. Property was stolen and any opposition was considered as treason against the state and was punishable by death. There was no authority from which to seek redress. The way to Rome was long and difficult and by the time one decree was rescinded another one was issued and negotiations had to start from the beginning to have its effects ameliorated, or a new governor would be appointed who would start his reign with a wave of persecution.",
                "The country then sank into deep poverty. For this reason so much was spoken of the wealth of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and it was said that only the tithe of the newborn cattle which he offered amounted to twelve thousand calves a year. Others said that whoever sees Rabbi Elazar in his dream is to take it as a sign of coming wealth, and when Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah died it was said that wealth departed from the learned.",
                "The primary source of Rabbi Elazar’s wealth was the inheritance which he received at his father’s death, but he also engaged in commercial enterprises and traded in wine and oil despite the prohibition of the scholars against trading with the necessities of life in Palestine. It was said of Rabbi Elazar that he was charitable and whenever he found a person who was willing to study but did not possess the means for his sustenance, he supported him. But in spite of his charities Rabbi Elazar said that no person should give away more than one-fifth of his possessions for charity.",
                "During the dispute with Rabban Gamliel II, which was described before, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was chosen Nasi. The reason why he was chosen from among other candidates who may have been better qualified for the office was because it was believed that he would easily relinquish the office in case of a reconciliation with Rabban Gamliel. In addition he was also respected because of his great wealth and his aristocratic origin. Rabban Gamliel was a descendant of Hillel the Old, five generations removed, who was a scion of the House of David. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was a tenth generation direct descendant of Ezra the Scribe.",
                "When Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was chosen Nasi he was still a very young man—according to tradition he was only 17 or 18 years old. Feeling grieved because of his youth and afraid that the people would not respect him because of it, he arose one morning to find that eighteen rows of gray hair had appeared overnight. (According to the Jerusalem Talmud Rabbi Elazar was really seventy years old when he exclaimed “I am like a man of seventy.”) But it is certain that despite his youth Rabbi Elazar was well versed in Halacha. His learning he probably gained from his father who was a scholar of such renown that even his brother was always referred to as Simeon the brother of Azariah.",
                "In praise of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah he was likened to a “basket full of incense” and to a dealer in perfumes who comes to a city and everybody gathers around him asking: “Have you good oils? Have you essence of roses?” and they find that he has all of these. Even thus the scholars came to Rabbi Elazar and whatever they sought they found with him. If they asked a question about the Torah he answered from the Torah; if he was asked about the Mishna he answered from the Mishna; the same with exposition, law or legend. He knew them all and possessed all knowledge.",
                "In later years Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was often found in the company of Rabban Gamliel. They travelled together with other scholars in the interests of the people. Although he was no longer Nasi, he accompanied the leaders of Jabneh whenever he was asked to do so, and for this reason it was said that a generation which can boast of a Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah should not be considered an orphaned generation.",
                "Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah especially excelled in exposition. He was careful not to break up the text into its component words and letters but clung to the realistic interpretation of the verses. He compared the Torah to a plant: just as a plant grows even so do the words of the Torah. When he noticed that the people were losing their confidence and respect for the scholars because of the differences of opinion which prevailed and that whenever one of them declared a thing to be clean some one else would declare it to be unclean, he said: Whenever scholars differ in the interpretation of the Torah and seemingly contradict each other, for one says clean and the other unclean, one prohibits while the other permits, it must not be concluded that there is any doubt about these questions, for all these opinions are derived from the same Torah. It is necessary to listen closely and with open heart to try to understand all that is said by those who declare a thing to be clean as well as by those who declare it to be unclean, by those who permit as well as by those who prohibit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תוספתא סוטה פרק ז׳.</span></i>",
                "It is told that Rabbi Akiba often tried to draw Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah to his own method of exposition, but Rabbi Elazar said: “Akiba, what have you to do with Hagadah? Finish your speech and return to pondering the laws pertaining to plagues.” On another occasion Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Akiba: “Even if you were to speak to me all day I would not be persuaded.” Altogether different were the relations between Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah and Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin who exerted a great influence on his method of exposition. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah even adopted some of the latter’s sayings such as, “Whoever profanes the festivals is like one who worships idols.”",
                "Of the teachings of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah particular significance should be attached to those of his maxims which lay down a practical foundation for man’s moral and religious obligations. He said, “All those sins which a man commits against God are forgiven on the Day of Atonement, but sins which are committed by man against man are not forgiven on the Day of Atonement until the man who was sinned against forgives his malefactor.”",
                "“He who listens to gossip or gossips about others,” Rabbi Elazar said, “may be compared to a person who bears false witness against his neighbor and should be severely condemned.” And commenting on the Biblical injunction to reprimand a person who had committed some wrong, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said: “I doubt if there exists a man today who knows how to reprimand his neighbor properly.” Regarding God’s prohibition of the eating of the flesh of a pig Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, “One must not say, ‘I am disgusted with it and therefore I cannot eat it’, but one should rather say, ‘I would gladly eat of it but my Father in heaven has forbidden me.’”",
                "God rewards every good deed even when the doer had his personal benefit in mind. Thus the Egyptians kept the Jews in Egypt for their own benefit, nevertheless God commanded that no Egyptian be put to shame, for we were permitted to live in their land. We must therefore forget the hard labor with which the Egyptians oppressed the Jews and must only remember their generosity in allowing us to live in their country.",
                "It was natural for Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah to value highly the observance of the Sabbath, nevertheless he said that whenever human life is at stake the Sabbath may be disregarded. Speaking of the significance of the commandments he concluded that the commandments were like the roots of a tree while the study of the Torah could be compared to its branches. He said: “One whose wisdom is greater than his deeds, what is he like? He is like a tree whose branches are many and whose roots are few and the wind comes and uproots it and turns it on its face. But one whose deeds exceed his wisdom, what is he like? He is like a tree whose branches are few and its roots are many and even though all the winds that are in the world come and blow upon it they stir it not from its place.”",
                "There are few statements of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah regarding the Jews as a nation, but one expression is characteristic of his outlook. Pertaining to this subject he said: “It is written in the Torah, ‘You have this day chosen me as your God and I have chosen you as my people.’ By this God meant to say, ‘You have given me one title and I have granted you one title. Even as you believe that I am the only God in the world so do I believe that you are one people in the world. God is one for his people Israel and Israel is the only people of God.’”",
                "An important question under discussion at that time was the commandment of “Yibum” and “Halitza.” The Torah commanded that if a man dies childless it shall be the duty of his brother to marry the widow. If the brother refuses to do so he must grant the widow “Halitza.” At that time there arose the question what to do in case the widow refuses to marry her deceased husband’s brother. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah ruled that if the brother has some defect which would make him socially undesirable he may be forced to grant “Halitza” to the widow instead of marrying her.",
                "When it was once remarked that a Sanhedrin which issues a death sentence once in seven years should be designated as a “bloody” Sanhedrin, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah added that even if a death sentence is issued once in seventy years it is a murderous deed.",
                "The last days of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah marked the beginning of the great rebellion. The scholars then left Jabneh and the academy was disbanded. Rabbi Elazar went to Sephoris and the Sanhedrin moved to Usha. The Talmud relates<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ראש השנה ל״א ב׳.</span></i> how the Sanhedrin wandered from Jabneh to Usha and then back to Jabneh. Later it left Jabneh a second time for Usha and thence to Shfarom and other places. Rashi attempts to explain these wanderings by saying that the Sanhedrin followed wherever the Nasi or his son settled. When other historians accepted this explanation they became confused in the sequence of events. What is more likely is that the Sanhedrin left Jabneh due to the persecution of the Roman government and not in order to follow the Nasi. At that time the Jews had no Nasi. Rabban Gamliel II was dead and the people feared to elect a new Nasi because the Romans disapproved of this office whose holders were looked up to as scions of the royal House of David and were therefore accorded royal honors. The people looked upon the Nasi as a Jewish king who was being interferred with by the Gentile rulers. At the time that the Sanhedrin moved to Usha, it may be assumed that the Roman government already came to the conclusion that they would never subdue the Jews as long as they observed the Torah. This also seems to be the reason why the Romans allowed every people to cling to its god as long as they paid their taxes to the government while at the same time they undertook to annihilate the Jewish people through the annihilation of the Torah.",
                "As was remarked above, we cannot now determine the exact years of the wanderings of the Sanhedrin and whether it visited Usha twice or the repetition was merely an error of the copyists. It is also unknown whether the sessions of the Sanhedrin in Usha were officially sanctioned or they took place secretly. Usha was a city in Galilee situated between Acco and Safed. During the constant revolutionary struggles of that time it is possible that the Roman government had no control over this city or that the military governor overlooked the actions of the Jews. This supposition may explain the transfer of the Sanhedrin from Jabneh to Usha.",
                "It is certain that no cases affecting life were discussed there. But it was necessary to introduce various new rules which were necessitated by the times. Life continued in its development and the moral and material circumstances of the time required new regulations. It therefore became imperative to meet in order to determine various innovations.",
                "Regarding the convocation at Usha it is told that a call was sent out to all the elders of Galilee that “whoever is learned shall come to teach others and whoever is not learned should come to learn.” Great numbers of people, responded to this call and when the time came for them to depart they said: “This place received us in such a friendly manner, should we leave it empty?” They therefore honored Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai who was a native of the city with an office although he was not the greatest of the scholars but because “the place adds to the honor of the man.”",
                "The people who gathered in Usha are referred to in the Talmud as the “wanderers to Usha” because they were men who lived elsewhere. In bidding farewell to the scholars who returned to their homes Rabbi Jehudah ben Elai said, “May God reward you for your effort in coming here, for one had to come ten miles, another twenty; one came a distance of thirty miles and another forty in order to hear the words of the Torah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ב׳.</span></i>",
                "We bring some of the most important regulations which were adopted by the Sanhedrin in Usha as characterising those times.",
                "Since every man must provide for his children when they are small and cannot earn their own bread, it was decided that every father must provide for his son until the age of thirteen and for his daughter until the age of twelve. Because of the persecutions of the government, many men were forced to flee their homes. This regulation—the responsibility of the father toward his children—was a hint that one may not leave his family, and if one is forced to save his life by flight he must first provide for his wife and children.",
                "If a man wills his property to his children, the heirs must support the father and mother as long as they live, and also the small children which were not included in the will. Until that time, any person who distributed his property to his heirs during his life time lost all rights to it and had to depend on the generosity of his heirs for his support.",
                "Due to the great need which prevailed among the people there were some individuals who denied themselves all worldly pleasures and distributed all their possessions to the poor. The assembly at Usha ruled that even one who is used to giving much for charity must not give more than one-fifth of his possessions and after that not more than one-fifth of his annual income.",
                "It was ruled that a father should deal kindly with his son until the age of twelve. If, after the age of twelve, the son refuses to obey his father, the latter was entitled to chastise him with a whip or to refuse him food.",
                "If a woman brought to her husband <span dir=\"rtl\">״נכסי מלוג״</span> (property which belonged to the wife exclusively but the fruits of which the husband could enjoy) and then she sold this property during the lifetime of her husband, the husband was entitled to claim the property after his wife’s death.",
                "The law of possession was also defined at this gathering (Chazakah). Just as an ox who gored three times was to be legally considered as a dangerous beast and its owner was to be punished according to the law, thus also, if a man held an article for three years, he gained the right of possession to it."

Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania approached the prison to speak with the boy and he began with a verse from Isaiah (42:24): Who gave Jacob to the looters and Israel to robbers?

                "If a man owned a Jewish slave and freed him at the end of six years, the Torah commanded that the slave should not be sent away empty handed but that he should be given gifts from the herd, the threshing floor and the wine cellar. (Deut. 15:14.) Rabbi Ishmael said, “Come and see how great is the mercy of the Creator who says to a man, ‘If a Jewish slave has worked for you and you send him away empty handed, he will have to beg from door to door or he will be forced to sell himself into slavery again. It is better that you give him some of that with which God has blessed you that he should not have to beg or to sell himself to another master.’”",
                "Mourning for the destroyed Temple occupied a central place in the thoughts of Rabbi Ishmael even as it did with all his colleagues. He said: “Since the Temple is destroyed, it were better not to eat flesh nor to drink wine, but such a decree could not be complied with. It is the same with marriage. So long as Rome rules the Jews with severe decrees and does not allow us to observe all the commandments of the Torah, it were better that no Jew should marry and bring children into the world. But in doing so the seed of Abraham would be annihilated.”",
                "As was mentioned above, there exists no certain information concerning the death of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha and there is also no substantiation for the legend which relates that a son and a daughter of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest were sold into slavery to two Roman nobles who attempted to marry them to each other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין נ״ח א׳.</span></i> Whether this event happened to Ishmael the High Priest and contemporary of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel the Elder or it occurred to the children of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha who was the pupil of Rabbi Joshua ben Chanania and the friend of Rabbi Akiba remains unknown.",

Because of his great beauty Rabbi Ishmael was loved by the emperor’s daughter and at his execution she begged that his head be given to her. She later removed the skin from the head and she had it preserved. It was also said that once every seventy years a man of Rome was chosen and the head of Rabbi Ishmael was placed on him, sometimes the king himself tried on the skin of Rabbi Ishmael’s face or placed his head upon himself.",
                "From all these legends we can gather that the political situation during the lifetime of Rabbi Ishmael was a sad one and became worse as time went on. The Sanhedrin could no longer meet even in Usha and the academy of Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha became the center of Jewish spiritual life. Whatever was discussed in that academy later became immortalized in many sayings and decisions of the pupils of Rabbi Ishmael who repeated his moral and legal teachings during his lifetime and after his death.",
                "The location of the academy has not been determined but it apparently was situated in a region over which the Roman government had no control. The Roman rulers had, by that time, discovered the secret that in order to rule Palestine they must suppress the Jewish religion. It was then prohibited to observe the Jewish faith and the maintenance of an academy was punishable by death. A law was also promulgated that if any scholar ordains (Semicha) a pupil, both the teacher and the pupil were to be executed.",
                "Of the legal and moral teachings of the school of Rabbi Ishmael, some possess permanent ethical value and may be used as examples for all times.

            "Rabbi Tarphon": [
                "A <small>REMARKABLE</small> and unusual personality of that time was Rabbi Tarphon. The name Tarphon is derived from the Greek, Tryphon. He is mentioned once by that name in the Jerusalem Talmud. The period of his influence and activity extended from the destruction of the Temple until the destruction of Betar.",
                "Rabbi Tarphon was descended from a priestly family and he told that once, while pronouncing the benediction together with the other Priests, he bent close to the High Priest in order to hear him pronounce the express name of God and he was seized by a great terror.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “Shem Hamforash,” the express name of God, is the name JHVH, which was forbidden to be pronounced. Only the High Priest could pronounce it on the Day of Atonement, and even then he melodiously whispered it so that others might not hear it. In later years the Mishna ruled that whoever pronounces the name of God according to the manner in which it is written loses his share in the world to come. Before that time the scholars taught the Name to their pupils only once in seven years. (Kidushin, 71.) Later it was entirely forbidden. The Talmud says that Rabbi Chananiah ben Teradion was punished because he taught his pupils the “Shem Hamforash.” (Avoda Zara, 17.) In passing it is worth mentioning that the form in which Gentile Bible critics read the “Shem Hamforash” is certainly incorrect. In ancient times the Name probably combined the vowel dots of Adonai and Elohim, but the correct form has been forgotten.</i>",
                "On another occasion, when the question was discussed whether the singers in the Temple must be without fault even as the Priests were required to be, Rabbi Tarphon swore that he remembered his uncle, his mother’s brother, who was lame and nevertheless blew a trumpet in the temple while the Levites sang. Rabbi Akiba asked him whether it was not a special festive occasion when such a thing would be permitted. Rabbi Tarphon replied: “It is as you say. It is remarkable that I witnessed it but forgot the nature of the occasion while you were not there yet you know what happened.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי יומא פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>",
                "What happened to Rabbi Tarphon at the time of the destruction and how he escaped the city is unknown. Later he settled in Lud and often came to Jabneh to participate in the sessions of the Sanhedrin. He was also present on the memorable day when Rabbi Gamliel was impeached. But he did not figure as a candidate for the office of Nasi despite his wealth and his great scholarship that was so extensive that whenever he sat with other scholars and someone came to ask a question he was the first to express an opinion.",
                "As a scholar he was named “the father of Israel,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי יבמות פרק ד׳ הלכה י״ב.</span></i> and every time that a dispute arose regarding some law he was very severe in his expressions. He frequently invoked old traditions with an oath that “if it is not as he says then may he lose his children.” When, after such an oath, Rabbi Akiba said to him: “I think that you have heard wrong,” Rabbi Tarphon conceded his mistake and said: “Akiba, whoever departs from you is like one who departs from life.” Whenever Rabbi Akiba saw a person who did not show proper respect for Rabbi Tarphon, he was ready to punish him severely. Thus it is told that one of the pupils, Jehudah ben Nehemia, once asked Rabbi Tarphon a difficult question which he could not answer. Rabbi Akiba said to that pupil, “Your face is joyous that you have asked the old man something which he could not answer. I shall therefore not be surprised if you will not live long.”",
                "The legend further relates that this occurred sometime before Passover, and when the scholars gathered again on Shavuoth, Jehudah ben Nehemiah, no longer lived.",
                "But we must not conclude that such occurrences of Rabbi Tarphon’s inability to answer questions happened frequently, for his learnedness was likened to a heap of nuts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין ס״ז א׳.</span></i> The meaning of this simile is explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק י״ח.</span></i> in this manner—just as several other nuts roll from the heap which is disturbed when one nut is taken away, so also Rabbi Tarphon responded to questions; he immediately adduced proof from the Scriptures, the Midrash, the Mishna as well as from Halachah and Hagadah.",
                "Although the Temple was no longer in existence, Rabbi Tarphon continued to gather tithes from all those who would offer them. Rabban Gamliel once met him in the morning and asked why he was absent from the academy on the previous day and Rabbi Tarphon replied that he was occupied with the “service”. Greatly surprised, Rabban Gamliel said: “Your words make me wonder for you say that you were engaged in service, but I do not know of any service that had to be performed on that day.” To this Rabbi Tarphon answered, “The eating of the tithes by a Priest in a city in the Land of Israel is like performing the service in the temple.”",
                "When Rabbi Tarphon accepted tithes, he did so not out of poverty, for he was a wealthy man. He evidently followed the custom in order to give the people an opportunity to fulfill the commandment of offering tithes; he also never distinguished between the givers and accepted tithes from all. Nevertheless he was not gredy and although he was not a spendthrift he generally returned the sums which he received for “Pidyon Haben” in his capacity of a “Cohen”.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בכורות נ״א ב׳.</span></i> To aid the people during a time of famine, he exercised his priestly prerogative and married three hundred wives (!) in order that as wives of a Priest they might partake of the tithes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תוספתא כתובות פרק ה׳ משנה א׳, ירושלמי יבמות פרק ד׳ הלכה י״ב.</span></i> In telling this story the Jerusalem Talmud employs the word <span dir=\"rtl\">״הערים״</span> to indicate that he tricked the law.",
                "In public Rabbi Tarphon always conducted himself modestly, so that no one should recognize him outside of the academy and that he should derive no benefits because of his knowledge of the Torah. Only once did he reveal his identity in order to escape a beating. As he was trying to take some fruit from his own vineyard, the watchman caught him and was going to beat him. Rabbi Tarphon exclaimed: “Woe to Tarphon that he is caught as a thief.” The watchman recognized him and released him and since then Rabbi Tarphon was wont to say, “Woe is me that I have made use of the crown of the Torah”.",
                "Constant differences of opinion regarding interpretations of the commandments existed between Rabbi Tarphon and Rabbi Akiba, but this did not mar the great friendship by which they were bound. Rabbi Tarphon once gave to Rabbi Akiba a sum of money with which to buy a field in order that they should have a permanent income and should be able to devote themselves to the Torah exclusively. Rabbi Akiba took the money and distributed it to the poor scholars.",
                "This story is related in two versions. According to one version<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מסכת כלה רבתי פרק ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Akiba said to Rabbi Tarphon: “If you wish, I will buy for you a village or two.” Rabbi Akiba took this money and distributed it to the poor. Sometime later Rabbi Tarphon met Rabbi Akiba and said to him: “Where are the villages that you were to buy for me?” Rabbi Akiba took him by the hand and led him to the academy where he distributed the money.",
                "The other version relates<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ויקרא רבה פּרשה ל״ד פּיסקא ט״ז.</span></i> that Rabbi Tarphon gave to Rabbi Akiba six hundred measures of silver and asked him to buy a field that they may both derive an income and be able to devote themselves to study. Rabbi Akiba distributed the whole sum to the scribes and the students of the academy. Some time later Rabbi Tarphon asked, “Have you bought the field of which I told you?” When Rabbi Akiba said that he had bought the field, Rabbi Tarphon asked if he could see it and Rabbi Akiba showed him the scribes and students to whom he gave the money.",
                "Characteristic of Rabbi Tarphon’s outlook was the occasion when he sat together with other Elders in Lud and they discussed the question of what is of greater importance, study or the fulfillment of the commandments. Rabbi Tarphon said that observance of the commandments was of greater importance. Rabbi Akiba maintained that study is more important and the other scholars concurred with the opinion of Rabbi Akiba, for “learning leads one to the observance of the commandments.”",
                "This opinion, that observance of the commandments is of the highest importance, is also expressed in other statements of Rabbi Tarphon who compared the relationship of man to his Creator to the relationship existing between a laborer and his employer. There exists one of his maxims, for instance, in which he says: “The day is short and the work is great and the laborers are sluggish, the wages are high and the master is urgent.” He also said, “It is not incumbent upon you to finish the work, nor are you free to avoid it. If you have learned much Torah you will be well rewarded and your master is trustworthy that he will pay you your wages.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אבות פרק ב׳ משנה ט״ז.</span></i>",
                "Speaking of the observance of the commandments, Rabbi Tarphon was led to speak of work in general. He then said that God did not permit the “Schechinah” to rest among the Jews until they completed the work of building the tabernacle. He also said that a man may die from idleness.",
                "Rabbi Tarphon generally embellished his speech with expressions from the Torah which in his mouth assumed a new significance. Wishing to express approval, he exclaimed <span dir=\"rtl\">״כפתור ופרח״</span> (a buttan and a bloom); to show disapproval he said, “my son shall not go with you” as an indication that he does not care to indulge in dispute and to express openly his disagreement.",
                "A bitter struggle was then being waged against the early Christians who were Jews and Rabbi Tarphon was their severest opponent. He engaged in disputes with them in an attempt to dissuade them from their beliefs. This fact is also mentioned in the writings of the Christian Patriarch, the martyr Justinus. Rabbi Tarphon then said: “May I lose my children if I would not burn their books, together with the mention of God that is made in them, if only I could obtain them.”",
                "It has been remarked that Rabbi Tarphon frequently exclaimed, “May I lose my children if this is not thus and so.” He did lose some of his children and his wife also died. Remaining a widower and the father of children, he chose the sister of his wife for a bride, and after the funeral of his wife he said to her: “Go feed the children of your deceased sister.”",
                "It is also necessary to note the great respect in which Rabbi Tarphon held his mother. It is said that she once lost a shoe and descended barefoot to search for it and Rabbi Tarphon placed his hand under her foot that she may not hurt her foot while stepping on the bare ground.",
                "It is to be assumed that Rabbi Tarphon lived more than seventy years. Traditions vary regarding his death. Some maintain that he was one of the Ten Martyrs while others deny it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מדרש איכה רבתי פּרשה ב׳.</span></i>",
                "To the nature of Rabbi Tarphon’s character it should be added that despite his angry disposition he nevertheless said, that if he were a member of the Sanhedrin at the time that it had a right to condemn people to death there would not have been a single death sentence passed."

                "T<small>HE DISTRICT OF</small> G<small>ALILEE</small> in northern Palestine was inhabited by non-Jews throughout the period of the existence of the first temple. Only in later years, during the times of the second temple, did Jewish settlements begin to extend into Galilee as the density of the population in the rest of the land increased. The emigrants who left the cities of Judea to settle in Galilee were mostly people poor in economic and spiritual resources, and there developed in Galilee a native type of “Ame Aratzim.” When these men of Galilee visited Jerusalem and later Jabneh, or some other city where the Sanhedrin resided, they were ridiculed for their childish naivete and were frequently called “Galilean fools.” The inhabitants of Galilee were also easily recognized by their manner of speech and by their uncouth behavior and the opinion was commonly held that Galileans are fools incapable of learning and that it was a waste of effort to attempt to change them.",
                "Then there suddenly arose a “Galilean” scholar who came to be ranked with the highest from his very first appearance and who later became known by his name, Rabbi Jose of Galilee. It occurred during a discussion regarding the rules governing the eating of the flesh of a first born animal that Rabbi Jose arose from among the disciples and proved that the two leaders of the academy—Rabbi Tarphon and Rabbi Akiba—were mistaken. One can readily imagine the surprise of all those gathered when they heard the Galilean present many proofs on behalf of his contention and they saw his firmness of conviction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">זבחים נ״ז א׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha heard the arguments of the Galilean he asked that Rabbi Akiba be told that he was in error and that the law was as the Galilean said.",
                "Since that day Rabbi Jose remained among the scholars of Jabneh and he was accorded greater honors from day to day. Everybody respected him.

                "Regarding the scholarship of Rabbi Jose it may be said that he succeeded in discerning that which others failed to see.

                "Some historians maintain that Rabbi Jose was well advanced in age when he came to Jabneh from Galilee and that he was already renowned at that time for his scholarship. They believe that, since Galilee was affected less than other sections of Palestine at the beginning of the revolt preceding the destruction, it probably became a place of refuge for the peace loving elements among the Jews who fled there to escape the vengeance of the rebels. Among the refugees was the wealthy Azariah, the father of Rabbi Elazar, who sent his son to study with Rabbi Jose.",
                "Rabbi Jose was widely known for his piety and the belief was widespread that were a drought to occur and Rabbi Jose was to pray for rain, he would undoubtedly obtain from God whatever he requested. It was also characteristic of the man that he was unhappy in his domestic life. The wife of Rabbi Jose, who was also his niece, was a wicked woman. She frequently shamed him in the presence of his pupils and when they asked their master why he does not divorce her, he answered that he could not do so because he did not possess enough money to pay her enormous “Kethubah” (dower-rights).",
                "Rabbi Jose once returned home from the academy accompanied by his pupil, Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. His wife paid no attention to him nor to his guest, and when he asked her whether she had any food prepared she replied angrily: “There is some boiled grass in the pot.” Rabbi Jose uncovered the pot and found in it the flesh of fatted hens. Together with his pupil he partook of the repast. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah then said to him: “She said that there was only boiled grass in the pot when it contained the flesh of hens. Why should she deceive you so?” Rabbi Jose replied, “Very probably a miracle occurred. She put grass into the pot, just as she told me, but the grass turned into the flesh of fattened hens.”",
                "After the meal was finished Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said, “Rabbi, send this woman away from your house. She does not know how to appreciate your worth.” But Rabbi Jose said, “She has a large ‘Kethubah’ and I have no money with which to pay it.” Rabbi Elazar answered, “We, your pupils, will provide the money to pay her ‘Kethubah’ and send her away.” Rabbi Jose then did as his pupils advised him.",
                "The woman then married the night watchman of the city who, soon after, lost all his possessions and also became blind. He therefore had to give up his position as watchman and his wife had to lead him from house to house to beg for alms for their sustenance. But whenever she came to the street where Rabbi Jose lived, she passed it by. Her husband then asked her why she did not lead him through the street of Rabbi Jose the Galilean, for he had heard that Rabbi Jose was very charitable, and she replied: “I was divorced by him and I could not bear to go into his house to beg for alms.”",
                "But one day the watchman and his wife made the rounds of the whole city and received no money. She then entered the street where Rabbi Jose lived but she skipped his house. When the blind man noticed this he began to beat her with his cane. Rabbi Jose heard her cries and when he found out their condition he lodged both of them in one of his houses and provided them with sustenance all the days of their life.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי כתובות פרק י״א הלכה ג׳, בראשית רבה פּרשה י״ז פּיסקא ג׳.</span></i>",
                "Especially interesting are the commentaries of Rabbi Jose to the commandments of the Torah. Sometimes he sought to lighten the burden of the commandments while at other times he tried to make them even more severe. The law concerning a “disobedient son” (<span dir=\"rtl\">בן סורר ומורה</span>) the other scholars interpreted in manner that would have made it impossible to condemn one such to death. Since a “disobedient son” could not be condemned unless he was also a “glutton” they declared that he could not be considered as such until he consumed a pound of meat, half boiled and half raw, at one gulp and at the same time drank half a quart of the best Italian wine at one sip. His gluttonous feast had to be made in the company of immoral youths and was to be bought with money stolen by the “disobedient son” from his father. In addition, they ruled that the “disobedient son” had to be at least thirteen years and one day of age but not much older than that, for then he could no longer be considered a “son” dependent on his father. The culprit must have had both a father and a mother who were required to be of the same opinion and appearance, for both had to lead him to court and had to present the same complaints against him.",
                "But Rabbi Jose believed that the essence of the sin of a “disobedient son” was gluttony and he believed that such a culprit deserved the death punishment because of his possible future. Engaging in such gluttony, a “disobedient son” was sure to waste his father’s wealth and to turn to stealing in order to satisfy his habits. He therefore believed that the Torah preferred the death of such a person while still innocent rather than his execution after committing crimes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין ע״ב א׳.</span></i>",
                "Rabbi Jose followed in the footsteps of Rabbi Akiba in the matter of expounding every saying of the Torah which might have seemed to be superfluous. Thus he explained the verse “but my Sabbaths you shall observe” (Ex. 31:13) to indicate that certain labors may be performed on the Sabbath such as work in the Temple or in order to save a human life. This interpretation he based on the word <span dir=\"rtl\">״אך״</span> in the Hebrew text.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תוספתא שבת פרק ט״ז.</span></i>",
                "In the case of many other commandments Rabbi Jose sought to lighten the burden of their observance.

                "He also expressed opinions which did not become accepted.

                "Some Biblical descriptions of historical events, such as the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, Rabbi Jose raised to great poetic heights. Expounding the verse, “why do you skip on wrinkled hills,” (Psalms, 68:17) he said: “When God was ready to give the Torah from Mount Sinai, the other mountains skipped about in confusion. They argued among themselves and each one claimed the honor of having God give the Torah to the Jews from its top.”",
                "In describing the rending of the sea before the Jews, Rabbi Jose said that when the Jews jumped into the sea even before the waters parted before them, Mount Moriah was torn out from its place and the altar upon which Isaac was to have been sacrificed hastened to the sea. Only when the image of Isaac lying bound on the altar and Abraham standing over him with his slaughtering knife could be seen did the sea part its waters, for only because of the merit of Abraham’s offering of Isaac was the sea rent for the Jews.",

            "Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph": [
                "T<small>HE HIGHEST PLACE OF HONOR</small> among all of our national heroes undoubtedly belongs to Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph. Like the lives of all historically outstanding personalities, Rabbi Akiba’s life history is also surrounded with legends which shed a saintly halo on his origin and personal development.",
                "Rabbi Akiba’s father was a proselyte, or the son of a proselyte, and he traced his descent from Sisera, the commander of Jabin the king of Hazor. In his youth Rabbi Akiba was a shepherd in the service of the wealthy Kalba Savua.",
                "Kalba Savua (sometimes referred to as Ben Kalba Savua) was one of the wealthiest men of Jerusalem before its destruction and he was renowned for his charities. During the war against the Romans he undertook to supply the inhabitants of Jerusalem with food for the duration of the siege of the city. There exist differing opinions regarding the meaning of the name. Some explain it to indicate that he was a descendant of Kaleb ben Jephuneh while others say that he obtained it because of his generosity—if a poor man came to his house hungry as a dog, he left it filled. But there is the much simpler explanation that the name Kalba Savua meant a “storeroom filled with grain.”",
                "Rachel, the daughter of Kalba Savua, loved Akiba and promised to become his wife if he would agree to devote himself to learning. It is told that Akiba was at that time already a man close to forty years of age and he did not even know the Alphabet. He had a son by a previous wife who was also an uneducated man. The love of Kalba Savua’s daughter was variously interpreted. Some said that it was but the whim of a spoiled rich man’s daughter who became infatuated with a shepherd. Others reasoned that the shepherd must have possessed such noble traits as would captivate even so noble a lady as the daughter of Kalba Savua.",
                "When Kalba Savua heard of this he disowned his daughter and vowed to disinherit her.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i>",
                "It is necessary to mention that when Rachel asked Akiba to devote himself to learning he at first doubted the wisdom of her request. At that time he felt a considerable disdain for scholars and also doubted his own capabilities of learning. But one day he happened to see how falling drops of water had, in time, hollowed out a stone and he said to himself: “If water, which is soft, could hollow out the hard stone, the words of the Torah, which are hard, will certainly make an impression on my soft heart.”",
                "Together with his son he went to a teacher and began his studies. But after he finished studying the Torah, history makes no more mention of the development of his son and continues to relate of Rabbi Akiba alone. For many years he was a disciple of Nahum of Gimso, then he turned to Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Rabbi Joshua ben Chananiah to show him the ways of the oral law. Rabbi Eliezer paid not the slightest attention to him. He only allowed him to audit his expositions but otherwise he ignored him. Rabbi Joshua, on the other hand, treated him seriously, for he appreciated his great desire to learn.",
                "For a long time Rabbi Akiba sat at the feet of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua. In later life he told that he served them both and did whatever they commanded him to do and even kneaded the dough for their bread. From this we may conclude how difficult were Rabbi Akiba’s circumstances. He was a poor man and his father-in-law would not aid him in the least. He gained his livelihood by picking a bundle of wood every day, half of which he sold while from the other half he would make faggots to light the house while studying. His neighbors then complained that the smoke from the faggots inconvenienced them at night and they advised him to sell all the wood and to buy oil instead.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק ו׳.</span></i>",

                "For thirteen years Rabbi Akiba studied with Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and the latter never deigned to ask an opinion of him until one day Rabbi Akiba began to ask questions of his master and he could find no answer to them. Rabbi Joshua then addressed Rabbi Eliezer with the following verse, “Is not this the people that you have disdained? Go and contend with them,” by which he meant to say that here was one whom Rabbi Eliezer constantly ignored and now he posed questions which could not be answered.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי פּסחים פרק ו׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>",
                "Another description of those events relates that after an absence of twelve years Rabbi Akiba returned to his native city accompanied by twelve thousand disciples. Listening to what was going on within his house he heard his wife arguing with a neighbor who asked her, “How much longer will you lead the life of a widow,” and she replied that if she were sure that her husband was devoting himself to learning she would gladly wait another twelve years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> Upon hearing this Rabbi Akiba returned to his studies for another twelve years and then he came accompanied by twenty-four thousand disciples.",
                "One can easily imagine what the poor woman felt when she saw her husband surrounded by so many thousands of disciples. As she made her way through the throngs and fell at his feet Rabbi Akiba’s disciples wanted to push her away, but he said to them: “Leave her be, that which I possess today and from which you can benefit I acquired only through her.”",
                "When Kalba Savua heard that one of the outstanding Jewish scholars arrived, he came to him that he may absolve him of his vow regarding his daughter. At that time Kalba Savua repented having allowed his daughter to suffer hunger for twenty-four years. Rabbi Akiba made himself known to his father-in-law and they were reconciled and Kalba Savua gave him half of his wealth.",
                "The Talmud relates that Rabbi Akiba then possessed golden and silver tables in his house and that he ascended his bed on golden stairs. As a reward for his wife who cut off and sold her hair to help him, he bought for her the most expensive adornments, one which was an image of Jerusalem engraved in gold which she wore on her head in place of the hair which she had cut off. But such ornaments were not allowed, at that time, to be worn by married women because of the mourning for the destroyed Temple, and the wife of Rabban Gamliel the Nasi envied the wife of Rabbi Akiba and told her husband. But Rabban Gamliel said to her, “If you had done for your husband what she did for hers I would buy you an ornament just like it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי שבת פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳, סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה ט״ו.</span></i>",
                "As might have been expected, Rabbi Eliezer was dissatisfied with the appearance of a new star on the firmament of Jewish learning, for it was obvious that he would tread new paths. Rabbi Eliezer clung strictly and without questioning to the traditional interpretations of the Torah. Rabbi Akiba, on the other hand, evolved a new method. He believed that the oral law was not a predetermined matter without spirit and incapable of further development. Not adduced from the text and the letters of the Torah.",
                "The Torah as we have it, Rabbi Akiba said, is complete and there is nothing lacking or superfluous in it. In its entirety it is all content without embellishment; it contains no artistic descriptions and no useless words. Every letter and every dot possesses some special significance.",
                "Wherever there occurs a repetition of a word it probably serves to indicate a special meaning. Even the connecting words and articles such as “if,” “the,” “but” and “also” are subject to interpretation. When it seems to one that there is a superfluous word in the Torah it is only because the person cannot grasp its meaning with his limited intelligence. Even the word <span dir=\"rtl\">לאמר״</span>„ which frequently occurs in the Bible has its significance and could be expounded. The article <span dir=\"rtl\">את״</span>„ in the verse “you shall fear the Lord your God (<span dir=\"rtl\">את ה׳ אלהיך תירא</span>) he explained to indicate that man must fear both God and his Torah. Another time he modified his explanation to mean that man must fear God and the scholars.",
                "Until that time the scholars only considered the content of the law and not its form. The oral law was not classified according to content and it was necessary to study much and to possess a tremendous memory in order to retain the rulings of all the scholars. Rabbi Akiba began to classify each law according to its content and he laid the foundation for the compilation of the Mishna which was finally written down and edited many years later.",
                "Regarding the significance of the interpretations of Rabbi Akiba to the Torah there exists a legend<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מנחות כ״ט ב׳.</span></i> which relates that when Moses ascended heaven to receive the Torah he saw God attaching little crowns to the letters of the Torah. Moses thereupon said to God: “Lord of the world! What prevents you from giving the Torah without these crowns?” and God answered him: “Some day after many generations there will arise a man Akiba ben Joseph who will derive heaps of laws from every little dash and it is for his sake that I prepare these little crowns.” Moses then said, “Will you show him to me? I would gladly look upon him.” God commanded Moses to look among the scholars sitting on the eighth bench and he saw there a man and he heard him expound to his disciples but he did not understand a word of what was being said although he heard the man conclude, “This I received as law to Moses from Mount Sinai.”",
                "Then Moses said, “Lord of the world! You have such a great man and You give the Torah through me?” and God replied, “It is My will.” Moses thereupon said, “You have shown me the man, now reveal to me his end,” and God answered, “Turn backwards and you will see.” Moses looked and saw the body of Rabbi Akiba being torn to pieces.",
                "A similar legend is also related in the Talmud that God revealed to Adam the record of all coming generations which will descend from him together with their scholars and their leaders and He also showed him the generation of Rabbi Akiba. Adam greatly enjoyed his learning but was saddened at sight of the death which awaited Rabbi Akiba. He attempted to obtain an easier death for him, but his request was denied.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">עבודה זרה ח׳ א׳, סנהדרין ל״ח ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Rabbi Akiba headed an academy in Bnei Brak which was located south-east of Jaffa. He frequently came to the sessions of the Sanhedrin in Jabneh and no important law was ever adopted without his participation. Once he arrived late at the academy and remained sitting outside. It was then said that “the Torah is outside” and no decisions were adopted until he came in.",
                "Attempting to describe the work of Rabbi Akiba, the scholars said that he was like a man who goes through the streets with a basket in his hand and picks up whatever he can find. If he finds wheat he puts it in his basket; if he finds barley he picks it up; the same with beans and lentils. Rabbi Akiba did likewise when he sought to introduce order into the laws.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אבות דר׳ נתן פרק י״ח.</span></i>",
                "It is claimed that Rabbi Akiba was versed in the various sciences, such as medicine and astronomy. He also spoke several languages and on several occasions he accompanied Rabban Gamliel on the latter’s trips to Rome in the cause of the Jewish people. When Rufus (or Tyranos Rufus as he is called in the Talmud) was governor of Palestine, he frequently debated with Rabbi Akiba many matters pertaining to the Jewish faith and the Torah. And when the Roman government began to suppress the observance of the Torah Rabbi Akiba could easily counteract these decrees.",
                "One of the brightest phases of the life of Rabbi Akiba, perhaps the outstanding event, was his participation in the revolt of Bar Kochba. Some historians claim that Rabbi Akiba was one of the leaders of the revolt, but this is probably an exaggeration just as the statements of others that Rabbi Akiba merely preached about Bar Kochba but took no active part in the revolt.",
                "Rabbi Akiba was already too old to take his place in the foremost ranks of the revolution. But his twenty-four thousand disciples, which according to legend died between the Passover and Lag B’Omer, probably joined the forces of Bar Kochba. The trip of Rabbi Akiba throughout the cities of Palestine and also to those beyond the frontier in order to establish which year is to be “Ibur” (a year containing thirteen months which occurs thrice every eight years according to the lunar calendar) was probably undertaken as a journey of agitation for the cause of the revolution. The same may be said with a large degree of certainty regarding the “Seder” in Bnei Brak where the most prominent Jewish leaders were assembled in Rabbi Akiba’s house.",
                "It is regrettable that the records of this revolt are so meager. In the description of the destruction of the Temple are included some events of the destruction of Betar and it is very difficult to separate them. Conclusive descriptions of Bar Kochba’s activities are found only in the Jerusalem Talmud<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תענית פרק ד׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i> and in Midrash Eicha Rabathi. But these are also complicated and mixed with terrifying legends. In addition there exists a description of Bar Kochba’s revolutionary wars in the writings of the Roman historian Dio Cassius who described the Jewish hero in a horrifying form. It thus becomes necessary to glean the events from various other occurrences of that time and still more is left for the imagination.",
                "When Rabbi Akiba saw Bar Kochba in all his glory he is said to have exclaimed, “This is the king the Messiah.” He invoked the verse from the prophet (Haggai, 2:21) which foretold that God would cause the heaven and the earth and the sea and the dry land to quake and that He would destroy the thrones of the Gentile kingdoms; their strength would be made to naught and their chariots and horses would be overthrown so that one would be slain by the sword of the other. Rabbi Akiba thus exerted a profound influence on the people. Hosts of people arrived daily to pledge their allegiance to Bar Kochba, for they all believed the words of Rabbi Akiba that Bar Kochba was the long awaited Messiah and that he would bring about the redemption of his people.",
                "Because of his belief in Bar Kochba, Rabbi Akiba allowed himself to be insulted by an obscure colleague, Rabbi Jochanan ben Toratha, who said to him: “Akiba, grass will grow out of your cheek bones and the Messiah will still not have arrived.”",
                "In explanation of the cause of Bar Kochba’s immediate popularity, Talmudic sources relate that when the Roman soldiers hurled stones at the walls of the Jewish cities with their machines, Bar Kochba ascended the walls and, catching the stones between his knees, he hurled them back at the enemy killing a few of them with each stone. Dio Cassius, on the other hand, relates that Bar Kochba would light a flaxen faggot and keep it in his mouth to convince his followers that he was a fire eater.",
                "Today we definitely know that the political situation of that time was intolerable. The Temple was destroyed and the Jewish state was no longer in existence for sixty years. Only a handful of the older generation who remembered the temple still survived, but its memory lived in the heart of the people and everyone dreamed of its restoration. The temple hill was transformed into a Roman soldiers’ camp and the Jews were in a worse position than slaves in their own country. The Roman governor of Palestine was the murderous despot whom the Jews named Tyranos Rufus and he persecuted them relentlessly and ridiculed their suffering. As the conditions became unbearable, the Jews thought constantly of liberation and whenever they gathered they would ask each other: “Will the Roman legions always keep their foot upon the neck of Judea? How much longer will the Roman eagle sink its claws into the living body of the Jewish people?”",
                "Bar Kochba then undertook to organize a Jewish army of hundreds of thousands of men with the consent of Rabbi Akiba and he succeeded in maintaining his revolt for three and a half years. Talmudic sources estimate the number of Bar Kochba’s soldiers at 400,000. Dio Cassius relates that the number was 580,000 or nearly two hundred thousand more than the Talmudic figure. People streamed from all sides and even the Samaritans, the traditional enemies of the Jews, forgot their hatred and joined the Jews in the struggle against Rome. Numerous neighboring people also joined the uprising in the hope that the liberation of Judea would also bring freedom from the Roman yoke for them.",
                "Wishing to test the bravery of his soldiers, Bar Kochba commanded each of them to cut off, or, with his own teeth, to bite off one of their fingers. But the scholars sent the following message to Bar Kochba, “Why do you cause your people to cripple themselves?” Bar Kochba replied by asking, “What other method shall I use to test their bravery?” and he was advised to command that each soldier must uproot a cedar of Lebanon with his bare hands while riding on a horse. Bar Kochba subsequently had 220,000 soldiers with cut off fingers and another 200,000 who uprooted trees bare handed while riding by on a horse.",
                "Sometime after this experiment Bar Kochba is said to have addressed the following words to God: “Since You have forsaken us and no longer go with us in our wars, we ask of You that You should not intervene. We do not require Your aid but only ask that You should not aid our enemies.”",
                "It was already remarked above that the descriptions of that war are very meager and at times contradictory. Nearly all the scholars of that time, with the exception of Rabbi Akiba, did not support the revolution and when it ended in failure they condemned Bar Kochba, and of the saying of Rabbi Akiba concerning Bar Kochba that “a star has arisen from Jacob,” they declared that he should not have used the word <span dir=\"rtl\">כוכב״</span>„ (a star) but rather the word <span dir=\"rtl\">כוזב״</span>„ (a deceiver).",
                "The revolt was prepared during the famous “Seder” night which is mentioned in the Hagada. Several Tanaim met in the home of Rabbi Akiba in Bnei Brak, where he headed a large academy with many thousands of students, to discuss the miracles of the departure from Egypt because it was necessary to come to a final decision regarding the burning question of that day—the impatience of the younger Jewish generation and their spirit of rebellion against Roman tyranny.",
                "The Roman authorities knew the mood of the people and attempted to suppress it. Informers mingled with the Jewish young men and every suspicious remark was reported to the Romans. They therefore feared to discuss openly the problem of Roman oppression and they spent the whole night discussing the “exodus from Egypt” and the great number of plagues which were visited on Pharaoh, to the number of 250, for they considered ten plagues insufficient in view of the suffering of the Jews. They also sought to console themselves with the hope that God would punish the enemies of his people as they deserved.",
                "This “debate” lasted all night while crowds of impatient people stood outside and waited for the decision of the scholars. In the light of the Passover moon, this group of men who came to celebrate the “Seder” in the home of Rabbi Akiba and told each other of the wondrous valor of Bar Kochba, seemed strange indeed. But the hours meanwhile passed. As the moon paled and the horizon became suffused with crimson, the pupils of Rabbi Akiba began to look into the house where the scholars sat and still debated the “departure from Egypt.” The people realized the danger of the situation, for Roman soldiers might arrive at any moment and inquire the reason why the “Seder” lasts so long. Their patience finally exhausted, they opened the doors and shouted, “Our teachers, the time for the morning ‘Shema’ has arrived,” hinting that it was time to end the debate.",
                "This exclamation put an end to the discussion. The impatience of the younger men triumphed over the weariness of the old. A ray of light penetrated the house and the scholars together with their disciples began to chant the old hymn of revenge, “Pour out Thy wrath upon the nations that have not known You.”",
                "The echo of the chant resounded from the hills of Judea. Like one man the people arose from Gilead to Bashan to cast off the yoke of the Romans. Young men armed themselves and the blacksmiths forged swords out of scythes.",
                "The Roman legions which were stationed in Palestine were too weak to withstand the army of Bar Kochba and the governor Rufus was forced to withdraw from the fortresses. Dio Cassius relates that the Jews immediately occupied fifty fortified cities and 985 open towns and villages. The Romans then withdrew from Judea, Samaria and Galilee and the Jews took over the government.",
                "When the first reports of the revolt were brought to Hadrian, he ridiculed them; but when other messengers arrived one after another reporting the defeat of the Roman legions and the danger that the revolt may spread to other provinces of the Roman empire in Asia, Hadrian became concerned and dispatched still other legions. But the reinforcements could achieve nothing.",
                "The victories of the Jews inspired within them the belief that they have regained their national freedom. Many Jews, who previously denied their origin and adopted heathen faiths to escape persecution, returned to the religion of their forefathers. Bar Kochba also wanted to immortalize the event of Judea’s liberation and he had coins minted in honor of the victory with the Hebrew inscription (in Samaritan alphabet) “to the liberty of Israel” (<span dir=\"rtl\">לחירות ישראל״</span>„).",
                "It is not known whether Bar Kochba occupied Jerusalem or whether he planned to restore the temple. There are grounds to believe that he was willing to forego Jerusalem and that he planned to move the boundaries of the land of Israel toward Galilee because of the condescending attitude and the ridicule with which the inhabitants of Jerusalem treated the people of Galilee.

                "Hadrian then recalled his greatest military commander, Julius Severus, who was then engaged in war in the British isles and placed him in command of the war in Palestine. Despite the bravery of Severus and the number of his troops which outnumbered the Jews two or three to one, he did not venture to meet the Jews in open conflict after the experience of his predecessors, and he waited for an opportunity to employ his strategy of small attacks. This type of warfare wearied the Jewish soldiers. The Samaritans, who fought alongside of the Jews at first, betrayed their allies. Severus persisted in attacking the Jewish forces on several sides at one time in order to force them to concentrate their armies in one place where he could finally engage them in a decisive struggle.",
                "This strategy forced the Jews to concentrate in the fortress of Betar which Severus then besieged. The inhabitants of Tiberias and Sephoris also deserted the cause of Bar Kochba and joined the Romans. An unusual drought affected the land and deprived the people of water. But all of these circumstances proved of no avail until Severus bribed the treasonable Samaritans. Bar Kochba was wary of the Samaritans and probably guessed that their loyalty was doubtful. But since the Samaritans could enter and leave the fortress freely they had an opportunity to show the Romans the secret entrances and their treason succeeded.",
                "The immediate cause of the fall of Betar is given by the Talmud as the blow which Bar Kochba delivered to Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin and which resulted in his instantaneous death. Throughout the siege of Betar, Rabbi Eliezer of Modiin shielded the city with his piety and everyone was convinced that the fortress would not fall as long as he lived. As Rabbi Eliezer was standing deeply immersed in prayer, a Samaritan came up and whispered to him something which he could not hear. This was related to Bar Kochba who questioned the Samaritan as to the secret which he whispered to Rabbi Eliezer. The Samaritan replied: “If I will not tell you what I said to Rabbi Eliezer, you will kill me; if I do, Emperor Hadrian will have me executed.” Bar Kochba guessed that Rabbi Eliezer was negotiating peace with the Romans and he therefore delivered the blow which caused his death. But this resulted in a moral defeat for Bar Kochba. The people within the fortress lost their war spirit and the Samaritans found it a relatively easy task to bring in the Romans.",
                "The horror of the Roman occupation of Betar is described in the story that their horses waded in blood and that the river which flows around Betar was two-thirds full of blood. The blood of the victims flowed in a mighty stream to the Meditaranean Sea and in its onrush it swept tremendous obstacles.",
                "Severus was anxious to capture Bar Kochba alive in order to lead him in his triumphal entry into Rome just as Titus did to the heroes of Jerusalem after the destruction of the temple. When he failed in this he promised a great reward to the one who would bring to him the body of Bar Kochba. A Samaritan brought Bar Kochba’s head and claimed that he had killed him. But Severus commanded him to bring the body of Bar Kochba, for he did not believe that the Samaritan could have killed the Jewish hero. When the body of Bar Kochba was discovered, a snake was found coiled around it and Severus declared: “I knew that only God could kill such a man, for no man could avail against him.”",
                "After the destruction of Betar Hadrian undertook to annihilate the whole Jewish people and wherever one was met he was put to death. If the person captured was of some importance he was tortured first and the tortures increased in brutality in proportion to the importance of the captive. Rabbi Akiba was one of the first victims. While still alive, his body was cut with iron combs. When the angels in heaven saw this they wept bitterly and their tears fell into the great sea and caused it to boil and the whole world was shaken by their voices as they asked God: “Is this Your reward to a man who observed Your Torah?”",
                "When Rabbi Akiba only began his career the aged Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinas said of him that “his name resounds from one end of the world to the other.” Rabbi Tarphon similarly said to him, “Whoever departs from you is like one who departs from life.” When Rabbi Akiba was dead, all the scholars agreed that “the arms of the Torah were severed and the springs of wisdom were sealed.”",
                "Rabbi Akiba often said, “Whatever God does, man must believe that it will end well. Whatever happens has been foreseen from above, but man nevertheless possesses a free will to control his actions. The world should be judged according to its virtues and whatever one receives in this world is but a small share of the reward which is to come.

If one is satisfied with his possessions, it is a good sign for him, but if one is displeased with his possessions, it is a bad omen.",

But one who possesses none of these would be better off dead.” To this Rabbi Akiba replied. “Three things you have told me and I will say three things to you: the ornament on a man’s face is a beard; the joy of a man’s heart is a wife, and the gift of God are children.

It was the habit of the emperor, or of one of his representatives, to sit at the gate of the city and to await any passing Jew who would then be captured and executed.",
                "While doing so the Romans made merry over the fate of the unfortunate Jews. If a Jew greeted a Roman, he would be addressed in the following words: “How dare you, a Jew, greet me? You are probably trying to deceive me with your greeting while you curse me in your heart. You therefore deserve to be put to death.” But if the Jew did not greet the Roman he would be addressed in this wise: “There goes a Jew who shows no respect for his emperor, he therefore deserves to be put to death.”",

                "Although the martyrs numbered in the thousands, legend conferred a special saintly halo upon ten of them. This legend mentions the names of the Ten Martyrs and it has been established historically that these were executed by the Romans although they did not all die at the same time.",

(Ex. 21:16.) The emperor then said: “Where are your forefathers, the sons of Jacob, who sold their brother into slavery? If I had them here I would immediately have them put to death. But since they are not here you will have to atone for their crime.”",
                "The emperor then allowed them three days in which to prepare themselves for the execution.

If God willed it, we will bow to his will, otherwise I will try to undo the decree of the emperor with the power of God’s name.”",

There he met the angel Metateron whom he asked concerning the decree and the angel said to him, “I have heard it announced that ten of the greatest Jewish scholars are to lose their lives at the hands of the Roman government.” Rabbi Ishmael descended and found his comrades engaged in prayer and fasting. They then began to discuss the laws pertaining to Passover. A messenger of the emperor arrived and said to them: “You know that you have been condemned to death and you have the patience to engage in learned discussions.”",

Why do you weep?” Rabbi Ishmael answered, “I do not weep because I have to die but because we are to be led to execution like common murderers.”",

The reason why he kept a goat was that Rabbi Jehuda suffered from severe coughing and the doctors advised him to drink goat’s milk while it was still warm. To prevent his goat from entering strangers’ fields, he always kept it tied to the bed post. Nevertheless the scholars refused to enter his house when he was sick because of the “robber” which he housed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי סוטה פרק ט׳ הלכה י׳.</span></i>.",

Rabbi Jehuda ben Baba then took his place between two mountains, between the cities of Usha and Shefarom, in order to ordain his disciples. He reasoned that if he was to be caught there no city would suffer through his deed. There he ordained five or six of his pupils. Suddenly they noticed soldiers approaching and Rabbi Jehuda said to his pupils, “Children, flee from here.” “But what will happen to you?” they asked him. He answered, “I will lie down on the ground and pretend death.”",

He was accused of devoting himself to learning and also of participating in the activities of the various robber bands which infested the land at that time. To these accusations he replied: “If you suspect me of devoting myself to the book, you cannot accuse me of using the sword, and if you accuse me of using the sword, you cannot suspect me of engaging in the study of the book.

                "Elisha believed that people suffer for the sins of their parents and he declared that when he was still a child his father sinned in vowing to make a scholar out of his son, not in order to fulfill the commandment of studying the Torah but out of pride. He was also oppressed by the weight of the sin of his mother who happened to pass by a house of idol worshiping when she was pregnant and inhaled the odors of the unclean sacrifices.",
                "Concerning his origin Elisha told that his father was one of the wealthiest men in Jerusalem. On the day of Elisha’s circumcision, his father prepared a great feast and invited all the prominent men of the city among whom were the two greatest scholars of the day, Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanos and Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah. When the guests turned to idle conversation after the feast, Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Joshua, “Let them speak of that which interests them while we will go to another room and discuss matters of the Torah.” When they began to discuss the Torah, a cloud of fire descended from heaven and enveloped them. Seeing this Avuyah said to them, “Do you wish to bum my house?” But they replied, “God forbid! We do not play with fire but are only discussing the Torah.” Avuyah then said, “If the power of the Torah is so great, then I vow that if my son will live to reach manhood I will consecrate him to the Torah.”",
                "The Talmud relates that the name “Acher” by which Elisha was called was not given to him by the scholars but by a harlot. It is told that a decision was adopted in heaven that since Elisha embraced an “evil culture” and lost his share in the world to come, he was to be allowed to enjoy the pleasures of this world to the full. Elisha once encountered a harlot on the street and asked her to go with him but she said, “Are you not Elisha ben Avuyah whose name is renowned throughout the world?” He tried to prove that he was another person and, it being a Sabbath day, he pulled out a radish from a field and offered it to her. The woman then remarked, “If you do so, you must be someone else.” (Acher —a different one.) Since that time the name “Acher” clung to Elisha.",
                "But despite Elisha’s heresies, he did not cease to study the Torah. Some even claim that he revered it to his dying day and praised those who fulfilled its commandments. Some of his sayings have become immortalized but it seems probable that the scholars refrained from acknowledging his authorship in many instances and even refused to quote them as having been stated by “Acher”. His statements generally dealt with secular and human problems. In only one instance is his name mentioned in connection with a regulation regarding mourning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מועד קטן כ׳ א׳.</span></i>",
                "Elisha was the teacher of Rabbi Meir, who was also a disciple of Rabbi Akiba and who was held in great esteem by his colleagues. The name of Rabbi Meir is frequently mentioned as the author of many opinions; but whenever it was suspected that Rabbi Meir’s statements were based on the opinions of his teacher Elisha, such statement were referred to as “others say” (<span dir=\"rtl\">אחרים אומרים</span>).",
                "Legends surround all of Elisha’s accomplishments from his childhood till the day of his death. Thus it was told that he sought to uproot the Torah and went from one academy to another driving out the pupils and handing over the teachers to be executed by the government. He then used to say, “Why waste the time of innocent children with such things? Would it not be better if they were taught to be masons or carpenters, hunters or tailors?”",
                "Another legend tells that when Elisha entered “Pardes”, he saw the angel Metateron whose duty it is to write down all the good deeds of the Jews once every day and he asked: “How is it that we have learned that none ever sit down in heaven for no weariness exists there but I saw the angel sitting when he recorded the deeds of the Jews. Is it possible that there are two kinds of forces which guide the world?”",
                "The angel was then scourged with sixty fiery lashes to prove to Elisha that he had no more rights than the others. It was then asked, “Why should the angel have been punished?” The answer was given that the angel should have risen when he saw Elisha. But despite the punishment the angel was given the privilege of erasing all the good deeds of Elisha from the book of records.",
                "It is probable that Elisha headed an academy before he was overcome by doubts and of his pupils Rabbi Meir attained prominence. Rabbi Meir said that he considered Elisha as one does a pomegranate—he ate the heart of the fruit and threw away the skin. Rabbi Meir sought every opportunity to listen to Elisha in an attempt to learn something new from him. Once on a Sabbath, Rabbi Meir was sitting with his pupils in the academy when he was informed that Elisha was riding by. Rabbi Meir went out to hear what Elisha had to say, but Elisha continued riding on his horse and Rabbi Meir followed him. When they approached the limit which one is allowed to walk on the Sabbath, Elisha said, “Turn back Meir for you may go no farther. By the walk of my horse I recognize that we have reached the limit of the distance one may walk on the Sabbath.”",
                "Rabbi Meir then said, “Will you not return also?”, but Elisha answered, “I have told you long ago that I heard a voice from behind the scenes that all strayed children may repent except ‘Acher’.” Rabbi Meir insisted that they return to the academy. The first boy whom they met, Elisha asked what he had learned on that day and the boy replied, “There is no peace for the wicked, says God.” (Isaiah, 48:22) They then approached another academy and Elisha again asked the first boy whom they met what he had learned and the boy answered, “Even though you wash in much chalk and use much soap the stain of your sin will remain.” (Jeremiah, 2:22) They thus made the rounds of thirteen academies and in every instance the children recited verses which were bad omens. Finally they approached the thirteenth academy and the boy said that he had learned the verse, “To the wicked God says, why do you speak of my laws?” (Psalms, 50:16) The boy stammered while reciting and it seemed to Elisha that the boy said <span dir=\"rtl\">אלישע</span> instead of <span dir=\"rtl\">רשע</span> (wicked). Elisha became very angry and some say that he drew a dagger and killed the boy while others claim that he merely said, “If I had a dagger I would now kill you.”",
                "Another time Elisha is said to have asked Rabbi Meir for his interpretation of the verse, “One against another God made them”. (Eccles. 7:14) Rabbi Meir said that whatever God created, He also created its opposite; He created high mountains and low hills; He created the seas and the rivers. Elisha then remarked, “Rabbi Akiba explained this verse otherwise. He said that God created just men and wicked men; He created a Paradise and a Gehenna. Every Jew may therefore choose between two shares, one in Paradise and one in Gehenna. If he is a just man he takes his own and his neighbor’s share in Paradise; if he is a wicked man he takes his own and his neighbor’s share in Gehenna.",
                "Elisha also asked Rabbi Meir’s explanation of the verse, “She may not be valued in gold or in glass and vessels of pure gold are not her equal.” (Job, 28:17.) Rabbi Meir declared that the verse refers to the Torah which can not be valued in gold but is broken as easily as glass. Elisha said, “Not so did your teacher Rabbi Akiba say. He said that just as golden and glass vessels may be mended after they are broken, even so may a sinful scholar be made whole again.”",
                "“Will you not repent now?” Rabbi Meir said. But Elisha answered, “I am lost for I heard a voice that all may repent except Acher.”",
                "The Talmud further relates that when Elisha died it was said in heaven that he can neither be judged nor can he have a share in the world to come. He could not be judged because he devoted himself to the Torah and he lost his share in the world to come because of his sins. Rabbi Meir said that it was better that he be judged that he may afterward regain his share in the world to come. “When I die,” Rabbi Meir said, “you will see smoke coming out of Elisha’s grave for I will certainly bring him to judgment because of his knowledge of the Torah.” Afterward Rabbi Meir also told that when Elisha was nearing death he wept because of his sins and it seemed that he repented in his heart.",
                "After Elisha’s death his daughter (the Jerusalem Talmud says his daughters) came to Rabbi Jehuda the Nasi to ask for bread. Rabbi Jehuda asked her who she was and she said, “I am the daughter of Elisha.” Rabbi Jehuda wondered that such a wicked man had children who remained Jews but the daughter pleaded, “Remember his Torah and overlook his deeds.” Fire then descended from heaven and enveloped Rabbi Jehuda. Rabbi Jehuda wept and said, “If this happens to those who dishonor the Torah, how much more can happen to those who glory in it?”",
                "Some historians maintain that one of the reasons for Elisha’s abandonment of Judaism was his great envy of Rabbi Akiba. Elisha felt humiliated that a man of unknown origin who began his studies in his later years should be elevated to such a high position by the people. He then said, “He who learns when a youth may be compared to one writing with ink on new paper, but when one begins his studies after he is old it may be compared to writing on erased paper.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">אבות פרק ד׳ משנה י״ט.</span></i> This is more exactly expressed in Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan: “He who studies in his youth absorbs the words of the Torah into his blood and they come clearly out of his mouth; but he who studies when he is old does not absorb the words of the Torah into his blood and they come out of his mouth indistinct.”",
                "From Rabbi Akiba’s statements we may conclude that he was an enemy of Elisha. Rabbi Akiba opposed Greek philosophy and said that whoever studies it loses his share in the world to come. Since Elisha devoted himself to Greek writings we may assume that Rabbi Akiba’s words were directed at him.",
                "Elisha seems to have had no sympathy with the movement of rebellion against Rome. When the Roman government began to persecute the students of the Torah, Elisha maintained, as did many other scholars, that one must not endanger his life for it.",
                "A Talmudic legend traces the beginning of Elisha’s doubts to his having seen a man climb a tree to remove a nest containing both fledglings and the mother bird. Although this was against the commandment of the Torah, nothing happened to the man. The following day he saw another man removing a nest with fledglings but the man sent the mother bird away, as the Torah commanded. Although the fulfillment of this commandment is to be rewarded by long life, the man was bitten by a snake when he descended from the tree and he immediately died. Elisha then asked, “Where is the long life that was promised to the man?” Others said that he began to doubt when he saw the tongue of Rabbi Jeduha the Baker (or of Rabbi Hutzpith the Interpreter) dragged around by dogs. Elisha then came to the conclusion that there was no reward for just men and he also lost his belief in the resurrection of the dead.",
                "We have already remarked that there probably exist numerous opinions of Elisha whose authorship is not acknowledged. But Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan contains a chapter devoted to Elisha’s sayings and to his opinions regarding men of great learning who also commit good deeds and men who only possess great learning. Elisha there says that a man of learning and of good deeds may be compared to a structure built on a foundation of stone while the walls are made of bricks; even the greatest flood cannot undermine such a structure. But a man who possesses much learning but no good deeds may be compared to a structure with a foundation of bricks and walls of stone. Such a structure is easily undermined.",
                "Another statement of Elisha in the same book well characterizes the man. He said: “A man may study for twenty years and forget all his knowledge in two years so that he would not know to differentiate between the clean and the unclean and he would confuse the opinions of one scholar with those of another until he finally would have to remain silent.”",
                "It thus becomes obvious that Elisha was a man of contradictions. At times he honored the Torah and was a friend of the scholars. On other occasions he was an enemy of the Torah and aided the Roman government in persecuting the scholars. He was always full of regrets and contemplated repentance but he was deeply convinced that he was beyond repentance because of his many sins.",
                "Elisha’s greatest crime was his treason to his people and his aiding the enemy at a time of persecution against the Jews. His intentions might not have been treasonable and it is possible that he honestly believed that bowing to the will of the Romans was the best policy. But history has proved this opinion to be false and the attempts to placate the Romans have ended in catastrophe. It is therefore no wonder that Elisha was condemned."

                "But Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel was not elected Nasi merely because he was a descendant of Hillel. His elevation to this post was due primarily to his personal qualifications. The scholars knew him well from the time that he was a young man in his father’s house. At that time he strictly observed the commandment to honor one’s father and in spite of the fact that Rabban Gamliel possessed many slaves, Rabban Simeon diligently sought to serve him. He frequently complained that “no matter how much I serve my father it is not even a hundredth part of that which Esau did for his father Isaac.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בראשית רבה פּרשה ס״ה פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>",

He once conceived the idea of doing away with the equality of the three leaders of the Sanhedrin which was the rule till that time. He then issued a regulation that when the Nasi entered the academy everyone was to rise and to remain standing until the Nasi would command them to be seated; when the head of the court entered, the people on both sides were to form two lines and were to remain standing until he was seated; when the “Chacham” entered everyone was to retain his position, whether seated or standing, until the “Chacham” took his seat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">הוריות י״ג ב׳, תוספתא סנהדרין פרק ז׳, ירושלמי בכורים פּ״ג ה״ג.</span></i>",

They were both greatly angered and Rabbi Meir declared that by issuing this regulation the Nasi broke a long standing custom that a man may only be advanced in sacred authority but not demoted. They decided to repay the Nasi in kind and since they were considered to be better informed in matters of law than the Nasi was, they determined to confront him with questions which he would be unable to answer. In thus exposing the Nasi’s inadequate learning they hoped to have him deposed even as his father was once deposed.",
                "Rabbi Nathan and Rabbi Meir decided to ask the Nasi to expound the regulations pertaining to the stems of fruit and its bearing on the cleanliness of the fruit. They expected to be able to confuse him very easily in these matters. But one of the Nasi’s devoted adherents heard of the plan and he thought that such questions and pilpulistic reasoning may bring shame on the Nasi. He therefore began to walk back and forth in front of the Nasi until he attracted his attention. He then told the Nasi of the plot and Rabban Simeon prepared himself for all possible questions. To make doubly sure, he did not allow Rabbi Nathan and Rabbi Meir to enter the academy on that day. They then sent in their questions in writing from the outside and Rabban Simeon sought to answer them as best he could. Whenever he was in doubt regarding some matter, the two on the outside sent in their answers.",

                "T<small>HE CITY</small> of Usha was chosen as the seat of the Sanhedrin after that body was reorganized with the permission of the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius who ascended the throne some time after the destruction of Betar. At the time that Rome was almost successful in eradicating Judaism from Palestine there developed a new center of Jewish spiritual life in Babylonia, which was not subject to Roman rule. The city of Nehardea occupied a particularly prominent place in the life of the Jews because it was the seat of the Exilarch who represented the Babylonian Jews and who was granted special privileges by the Parthian government. Before Nehardea attained its importance, there was a large Jewish settlement in the city of Netsivin which was closer to Palestine but Hadrian’s legions reached this city and laid it waste and slaughtered its inhabitants. Among those that saved their lives there was also Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra II who later organized an academy. But he did not succeed in concentrating a large number of people about his academy because everyone sought to settle farther in the interior of Babylonia in order to be safe from Roman attacks. It was then that another scholar Hananiah (or Hanna) the nephew of Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, selected Nehardea as his residence and established there a large academy.",
                "When it became known in Babylonia that all religious activity in Palestine was being suppressed, Hananiah undertook to establish a Supreme Court. Feeling convinced that since the destruction of the temple the main duties of the court consisted in determining the leap years and establishing the dates for the festivals, he believed that these functions could just as well be fulfilled in Babylonia. But this situation was considered by the Palestinian scholars as an attempt to undermine their authority. The Nasi, Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel, especially objected to self established authorities outside of Palestine and he sent two special messengers to BabyIonia to attempt to change matters.",
                "This mission to Babylonia is described in two differing versions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The story of this mission is described in Berachoth, 66 as well as in Jerushalmi Nedarim, 6:5 and in Sanhedrin, 1:5. The names of the messengers that are given in the Babylonian Talmud are different from those listed in the Jerusalem Talmud. The Jerusalem Talmud also omits the name of Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel and only mentions “Rabbi” which might indicate that this event occurred during the days of the Nasi Rabbi Jehudah. But such an assumption is hardly probable since the office of the Nasi in Palestine during the time of Rabbi Jehudah was secure and it was unlikely that anyone in Babylonia would have tried to compete with the Palestinian leadership at that time.</i>)",
                "It is told that the Nasi entrusted three letters to the messengers which he sent to Hananiah in Babylonia and he commanded them to show these letters one at a time. The first letter contained “greetings to the worthy holiness of Hananiah”. When the messengers were asked what their mission was in coming to Babylonia, they said that they came to study. Hananiah then presented them to his colleagues and said, “These are renowned men whose forefathers conducted the service in the temple.”",
                "Later the messengers paid close attention to the expositions of Hananiah and attempted to prove to him that he was in error regarding various laws. Greatly angered Hananiah wanted to denounce them but they showed him the second letter of the Nasi which informed him that “the kids which he had left in Palestine had meanwhile grown up and developed sharp horns.”",
                "Hananiah wanted to denounce the messengers from Palestine as swindlers but they said to him, “Since you believed our words before, you cannot now denounce us.” At the same time they also gave him the third letter of the Nasi in which Hananiah was commanded not to assume the right of establishing New Years and determining the Holidays. Hananiah objected that he had a right to do whatever he thought was best for the people and he also cited that Rabbi Akiba once determined a leap year when he was outside the boundaries of Palestine.",
                "“Do not compare yourself to Rabbi Akiba,” the messengers answered, “for none could compare with him even in Palestine.”",
                "“Neither did I leave in Palestine anyone that could compare with me,” Hananiah retorted.",
                "The messengers then called his attention to the contents of the second letter which reminded him that the small people which he left in Palestine had grown in stature and that they commanded him, “if you will obey and depart from your ways all will be well, otherwise you will be driven out from the community of Israel and you can choose a place for an altar and sacrifices and music even as the Jews of Alexandria once did.”",
                "When the messengers realized that Hananiah was still unwilling to submit, one of them ascended to read the Torah on the day that Hananiah declared to be a feast day, but he changed the text to read, “These are the holidays of Hananiah”. The audience immediately corrected him that he should read “These are the holidays of God”. The messenger replied, “It is true that in our books it is written ‘These are the holidays of God,’ but here one should substitute the name of Hananiah because he determines the holidays as he chooses and not as God commanded”.",
                "Then the second messenger arose and recited a verse “Out of Babylon shall come the Torah”; the audience corrected him that he should say “Out of Zion”. The messenger replied: “In our books it is written ‘Out of Zion,’ but judging by your conduct you may write “Out of Babylon” in your books.”",
                "All the people gathered began to weep and were ready to obey the words of the messengers from Palstine but Hananiah still refused to submit. He went to Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra of Netsivin to ask his advice. Rabbi Jehudah suggested that he submit because the Great Court of Palestine was the only body with authority to regulate the religious life of the people both within as well as outside of Palestine.",
                "It is also related of Hananiah that he frequently travelled from Palestine to Babylonia but he was always grieved to leave the country. Once he was accompanied by Rabbi Jehudah ben Bathyra, Rabbi Mathia ben Harash and Rabbi Jonathan. When they reached the boundary of Palestine and bethought themselves of the land which they were leaving, they rent their garments and wept. Grieved at the thought of leaving the Land of Israel, they abandoned all thoughts of personal safety which awaited them in Babylonia and returned.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ספרי פּרשת ראה.</span></i>",

                "The reason that Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah sent his nephew, Hananiah, to Babylonia is said to have been due, not so much to the danger which threatened all scholars of Palestine as to the fact that the “Minim” (the Jewish Christians) cast a spell on him and he forgot which day it was and came riding to the academy on the Sabbath. Wishing to save him from this spell, his uncle sent him away to Babylonia.",
                "The Jews of Babylonia lived in security and peace while the Jews of Palestine were being sorely oppressed. Even after the emperor Antoninus Pius alleviated their prosecutions and granted them freedom to observe all the customs of the Jewish faith, the situation of Palestine Jewry still could not compare to that of the Jews of Babylon who enjoyed autonomy in their religious life under the leadership of an Exilarch. But these differences in favor of Babylonia did not deter many Jews from returning to Palestine as soon as they heard of the improved situation in that country for everyone believed that in Babylonia he was removed from God and that God’s grace rested only in Palestine.",

We are more concerned here with his ethical maxims which reflect a great love for the Jewish people, the Torah and the Land of Israel. Of special interest are his ideas about death.",
                "Death was not considered as an uncommon and cruel phenomenon during the time of Rabbi Meir. The constant wars and the bloody persecution of the Jews hardened the people to consider death with indifference. If a man lost his life for his observance of Judaism, his relatives were comforted by the belief that he had sacrificed himself for the sake of God, Rabbi Meir probably witnessed the death of Rabbi Akiba as well as the execution of many others. Later he witnessed the death of his father-in-law, Rabbi Hanina ben Teradion. Rabbi Meir therefore evolved a philosophic outlook on death and he frequently turned to the book of Job. Rabbi Jochanan relates that every time that Rabbi Meir finished reading of that book he would say: “The end of a man is death; the end of animals is slaughter; everything in the world is doomed to die. Happy is he who is raised in the knowledge of the Torah and who strives for it thus causing satisfaction for his Creator. Such a man prospers in his good name and he leaves the world in good repute as king Solomon said: a good name is better than fragrant oil and the day of death is better than the day of birth.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות י״ז א׳.</span></i>",

The Roman empire was then occupied with wars on many fronts due to the simultaneous revolts of the Germans and the Dacians. It was therefore said that “whenever one sees the horse of a Parthian tied to a tombstone in Palestine he may expect the early coming of the Messiah.” Another statement of the scholars declared that “they who have destroyed the temple will in the end fall into the hands of the Parthians.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The two above mentioned quotations from the Talmud use the name “Parsim” (Persians) but it is obvious that the Parthians and not the Persians were referred to.</i>",

Since that day Marcus Aurelius assumed the name Antoninus and after the death of Antonius Pius the Roman senate decided that a son of his, named Lucius Varus, should share the throne with Marcus Aurelius. It thus occurred that two emperors reigned simultaneously.",

But since emperor Varus reenacted some of Hadrian’s decrees forbidding the observance of the Sabbath and the practice of circumcision it may be assumed that the masses of the people actively participated in the struggle with the consent of the scholars or against their wishes.

Another man refused to partake of his wife’s cooking until Rabbi Jehudah and Rabbi Simeon would taste of it.

When Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel II died, his son Rabbi Jehudah was appointed Nasi. Although documentary evidence is lacking, it is apparent that the assumption of office by the new Nasi took place with the consent of the authorities. Roman suspicion of the Nasi’s descent from the royal House of David had subsided by that time and no attempt was any longer being made to offer the office to a man of less aristocratic lineage.",
                "The Talmud always refers to Rabbi Jehuda the Nasi only by his title of “Rabbi”. Because his contemporaries were convinced that he was the most pious man since the days of Moses, he was also called “Rabenu Hakadosh”, our holy teacher.

Being the son of the Nasi and destined to occupy the post of his father, Rabbi Jehudah was provided with the best tutors who acquainted him with all sciences. Gifted with great talents and a natural curiosity he absorbed much learning and assimilated it in his personality. In his youth Rabbi Jehudah studied with his father<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי שבת פרק י׳ הלכה ה׳.</span></i> and later he was a pupil of the academies of Rabbi Jehudah bar Elai, Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua and others.",

He likewise had to know the nature of various plants and animals in connection with the dietary laws and the regulations pertaining to cleanliness.

His pronouncements were considered as law and no one dared to criticize his actions. Rabbi Jehudah devoted much effort to the attainment of this goal and he was successful. In Babylonia as well as in Palestine and in all the other countries his decisions were unquestioned.

As Rabbi Ishmael ben Rabbi Jose was once making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem he passed through Shechem. The Samaritans ridiculed him for making a pilgrimage to a ruin which God rejected and declared that it would be more reasonable to offer prayers on Mount Gerizim which had been blessed by God.

Some time later his daughter saw an insect in the house and she wanted to kill it, but Rabbi Jehudah said to her: “Leave it be.

During these visits they engaged in friendly arguments concerning religious questions. The confidence of the emperor in the Nasi was said to be so great that he often asked Rabbi Jehudah’s advice in such matters as the succession to the Roman throne and his conduct toward his daughter who deviated from the ways of morality.",
                "Most of these stories are related in Tractate Avoda Zara and as historical proof of their being based on fact we may cite the writings of the Christian Church-Father Hieronymus, who lived at a time when these events were still fresh in the memory of the people. Other historians, however, find it difficult to establish definitely which emperor was referred to. During the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah there ruled two or three emperors who added the name Antoninus to their given names. But the personalities of none of these emperors fit the legendary description of a great friendship with the Jewish leader. Antoninus Pius, who was the first to ameliorate the condition of the Jews in Palestine, could not have been the hero of these legends because he was not a friend of the Jews despite the fact that he modified Hadrian’s decrees. Furthermore the period of his reign does not coincide with the period given in these legends either.",
                "Still other historical commentators deny the truth of the legend and maintain that the growth of Christianity which then gained the friendship of some Roman emperors caused the Jews to ally themselves with the Roman opponents of Christianity and to fabricate the story of the friendship of the emperor. Some of those that recognize the factual basis of the legend claim that it concerned a Roman governor named Antoninus and not an emperor.",

When Gira, the daughter of Antoninus, began to conduct herself immorally Antoninus sent to Rabbi Jehudah a herb named Gagira thus informing him of the situation and requesting his advice. Rabbi responded by sending a herb named Chusbarta to express his opinion that he was justified in killing her. In reply Antoninus sent a bloom named Karthi indicating his inability to execute a member of his family and Rabbi sent him a herb named Chasa to advise him that he should keep the whole matter secret.",

The messenger returned to Antoninus and reported that Rabbi Jehudah gave no answer to the question. “Did he do anything in your presence?” Antoninus asked and the messenger related what he had seen.

It is told that Antoninus sought to serve Rabbi every time he visited him and when Rabbi was taking his place in the litter to be carried to the academy, Antoninus would bend down so that his back might serve as a step for Rabbi. When Rabbi Jehudah objected to this servility because it lowered the dignity of the royal office Antoninus remarked: “I wish that I could be as a rug under your feet in the world to come.” Antoninus also sent sacks full of gold to Rabbi and these he covered with wheat to hide from the populace the fact that he was giving money belonging to the government to the Nasi. Rabbi Jehudah said to him: “Why do you do this? I do not need it.” Antoninus replied: “Let it remain for those who will come after you and they can pass it on to future generations.” It is also told that Antoninus leased to Rabbi Jehudah two thousand acres of land in Palestine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי שביעית פרק ו׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>",

Antoninus then underwent circumcision and it was said that when Messiah comes he would be in the front rank of the proselytes. Incidentally it was also told that Antoninus presented a “menorah” to the synagogue in Tiberias. When Rabbi heard of the gift he exclaimed: “Praised be God who inspired him with this idea!” The fact that he did not say, “Praised be <i>our</i> God!” was interpreted by some to prove that Antoninus had not embraced Judaism.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי מגלה פרק ג׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>",

At one such feast which took place on a Sabbath only cold food was offered. Antoninus ate the food and praised it highly. At another feast which was given on a week day hot victuals were served but Antoninus declared that the cold foods that were offered on the Sabbath were tastier. Rabbi Jehudah explained that the hot food did not contain a certain herb which was mixed with the cold food. When Antoninus asked in surprise what that herb was, Rabbi said that it was named “Sabbath”.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בראשית רבה פּרשה י״א פיסקא ב׳.</span></i>",

                "During one of these discussions Antoninus argued that both body and soul may escape punishment on the day of judgment. The body may claim that it could not sin if it had not been imbued with a soul and the soul could reason likewise. Rabbi Jehudah explained what could be done in such a case with the following example from human behavior: The owner of a garden hired two watchmen, one of whom was blind and the other lame, to guard the fruit. The lame one saw the fruit on the trees and he desired to eat of them. He then said to the blind watchman, “Lead me to the tree and we will both eat the most beautiful fruit.” The blind man then carried the lame one on his shoulders and they ate all the fruit. Later the owner of the garden arrived and he asked: “Who ate all the fruit of the tree?” The blind man said: “You cannot blame me for you know that I cannot see.” The lame watchman similarly declared: “You cannot blame me for I could not walk to the tree.” The owner then placed the lame one on the back of the blind one to show them that he understood how they reached the fruit and he punished them. God does likewise when body and soul attempt to escape punishment by placing the blame on the other.",

                "The greatest achievement of Rabbi Jehudah which immortalized his influence and gave him a place in our history almost rivalling that of Moses was his editing of the Mishna in which he compiled all the laws and customs of Jewish life as they were then accepted by the people orally as interpretations and supplements to the commandments of the Torah. The traditional oral explanations were handed down from one generation to another by the priests, the Levites and the scholars. These laws and opinions were never systematically written down in order to prevent their rivalling the sanctity of the Scriptures but single scholars kept short notes of what they heard from their teachers and these notes circulated extensively until they were gathered and edited by Rabbi Jehudah. Many of these traditional interpretations were accepted as legally binding as early as the time of Simeon the Just but during the years they were amplified and developed until there arose differences of opinion which seemed contradictory.",
                "The first Mishna of tractate Berachoth thus begins with a question: “At what time does one have to recite the Shema?” The Mishna expresses no doubt regarding the necessity of reciting the Shema, but is merely concerned with the length of time allowed for this prayer. The majority of the laws and customs cited in the Mishna are not referred to any one person. It was considered irrelevant who the original author of a basically accepted law had been. As the years went by the names of these authors were often forgotten and the Mishna merely endeavored to establish the origin of the laws in the scriptural texts deriving them literally or through exposition.",
                "Throughout the centuries that elapsed from the time of Simeon the Just until the days of Rabbi Jehudah many scholars were killed and with them the distinct knowledge of many laws was lost. Numerous customs also lapsed in the course of time. The remaining scholars would then assemble witnesses to testify concerning doubtful interpretations of laws and the manner of their observance. In compiling the Mishna Rabbi Jehudah sought to achieve a similar goal.",
                "The persecutions which mounted through the ages severed the Jews from contact with the surrounding environment and forced them into the narrow bounds of their own intimate group life thus blinding them to what was going on outside. They then devoted all their spiritual energies to the Torah; they reckoned every word and letter in the Torah and surrounded even minor words and seemingly unnecessary letters with numerous interpretations.",
                "These interpretations and elucidations were called Mishna because it was a more complete and improved code of laws for the conduct of mankind. Many of the Biblical commandments were rather vague in their context and required further elucidation. Nevertheless when Rabbi Jehudah compiled the Mishna in six “orders” which were divided into sixty tractates there remained some laws which were not included for some reason unknown to us and these were later included in the Talmud as Boraitha or in Tosephta.

He therefore decided to have them written down and edited. He entertained no such fears concerning the Torah and he felt sure that its spirit would remain alive even if the books of the Torah were to be destroyed. The constant oppression and the weakening human spirit did inspire him with foreboding concerning the observance of the numerous traditions.",
                "As Rabbi Jehudah gathered the various laws to include in the Mishna he omitted the explanatory arguments and conflicting opinions which had been added.

It was an accepted axiom of the Jewish faith that all of these Halachoth were orally given to Moses on Mount Sinai.

When we assume that custom was the foundation of law we must bear in mind that customs become antiquated and lose their original purpose. We therefore find in the Mishna numerous laws whose intent is no longer clear. In such cases it was the established rule of the court to observe the accepted procedure of the populace.

                "The laws of the Mishna developed to a large extent out of analysis of the words of the Torah. This method was then considered to be the most valid and the only one capable of bringing out the simple meaning of the text. The Biblical verse “on the morrow after the Sabbath” (Lev. 23:15) was thus explained to mean the morrow of the first day of Passover and not the morrow of the Sabbath as the Sadducees claimed. The interpretation of the Sadducees would cause Shavuoth to occur on a Sunday always. Similarly they explained the Biblical injunction that a man must marry the childless widow of his brother to be operative only if the woman had no children at all despite the text of the Bible which reads “if he has no son”. These two interpretations must have been accepted long before the compilation of the Mishna because the Septuaginta, the Greek translation of the Torah, rendered these verses in accordance with the Mishnaic explanation.",
                "After the destruction of the temple this method of exposition gained in popularity and every word was minutely analyzed. The seven rules of interpretation which Hillel the Old set up increased in time to thirteen (formulated by Rabbi Ishmael) and later they were expanded by Rabbi Jose of Galilee to 32. Rabbi Akiba attached significance to every word and letter in the Bible. A contributing factor which influenced this form of reasoning was the fact that the text of the Bible was then written without vowel signs. Although everyone knew the traditionally correct reading of the text tradition was frequently overlooked and the ambiguity which the lack of vowel signs caused gave ground to interpretations contrary to the spirit of the text.",
                "When Rabbi Jehudah began to compile the Mishna, two generations had passed since the first tractate “Eduyoth” was composed. In the intervening time many laws developed along new lines due to historical developments which could not have been foreseen. Rabbi Jehudah carefully weighed all the pros and cons concerning all laws before he determined their final form. Although he used the Mishna of Rabbi Akiba extensively he did not include all the laws listed in it because his decisions were based on the opinions of the majority of his contemporary scholars. He also changed the order of Rabbi Akiba’s Mishnayoth which arranged the laws according to their authors and not according to subject matter.",
                "Rabbi Jehudah arranged the Mishna according to subject groups. The first group dealt with prayers and benedictions; the second dealt with the laws of cultivation of the soil and the attendant regulations; the third dealt with the regulations governing the observance of the Sabbath and the holidays, fast days and other historical memorial days; the fourth group included laws pertaining to family life, vows and Nazarites; the fifth dealt with money matters, the Sanhedrin and relations between man and the community; the sixth included the laws of the sacrifices and the regulations of cleanliness. But Rabbi Jehudah was not altogether successful in classifying the material as he wished. The great volume of subject matter at hand could not easily be made to conform with rigid classifications and we thus find problems of money matters among the laws of marriage or the regulations of the holidays; dietary laws are frequently found among regulations pertaining to the offering of sacrifices.",
                "Historians differ as to the motives which prompted Rabbi Jehudah to compile the Mishna. Some maintain that he undertook the work in order to preserve the traditions from being lost. Others claim that his primary motive was to define the laws once and for all and to remove any possible ambiguities. Such conflicting opinions as are found in the Mishna or cases where the final decision concerning a law was not laid down these historians explain as being additions of a later day.",
                "The Halacha, which constitutes the greater part of the Mishna, is accompanied by all the arguments which were advanced concerning the law as well as by the fundamental cause which brought about the enactment of the law, which was often derived from scriptural text which had no direct bearing on that law. In explanation of this view the Talmud states that Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai studied the disputes of Abayei and Rava<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סוכה כ״ח א׳.</span></i> implying that he foresaw the possible future argumentation of these two scholars.

                "The second important component of the Mishna is the Drasha (exposition) which consists of interpretations of words to substantiate the opinions of the Tana. These Drashoth (pl. of Drasha) are generally preceded by the words “I am instructed to say” (<span dir=\"rtl\">תלמוד לומר</span>) or “it is intended to teach you” (<span dir=\"rtl\">ללמדך</span>). It is noteworthy, however, that in some cases the law is stated at once in its final form while at other times all the interpretations of the words and even of the letters are quoted.",
                "The Mishna was written in Hebrew which was slightly modified from the language of the Bible. Because of the practical problems with which it concerned itself it had to depart from the poetic idiom of the Scriptures and in order to express the numerous new concepts words had to be borrowed from the languages which were then currently spoken in Palestine such as Chaldean, Aramaeic, Greek and Latin. The foreign words that were introduced into the Mishna were modified to conform to the spirit and the grammar of the Hebrew language. The same words were not always used to define one concept because the editor of the Mishna sought to retain the original idiom of the Tana who expounded the law and these employed the idioms that were current in their time. The style of the Mishna illustrates Rabbi Jehudah’s keen sense for the Hebrew language. In his own household Hebrew was spoken exclusively and to determine the correct spoken form of some Hebrew word many went to hear the servant of Rabbi Jehudah speak. The Hebrew language was still the spoken tongue of the majority of the Jews and it was flexible enough to express the finest abstract concepts.",
                "It is impossible to point out those Halachoth in the Mishna which were quoted from the original statements and those which Rabbi Jehudah phrased in his own words. Only a skilled philologist could recognize the stylistic nuances between the original statements and those which were rephrased. The beginning of every book of the Mishna quotes the most important laws of the group dealt with. It is therefore assumed that these are quotations from earlier Tanaim and are given in their original wording with the name of the Tana omitted. This is also the case when the authorship of the Tana was acknowledged. However there are statements in the Mishna that are ascribed to certain Tanaim which are recognizable as not being direct quotations. In such cases Rabbi Jehudah was probably more interested in the essence of the opinion rather than in its exact wording.",
                "There are indications that the text of the Mishna underwent modification during the lifetime of Rabbi Jehudah. Some of these were probably made by Rabbi Jehudah himself. This may account for the different version of the Mishna which sometimes occurs in the Jerusalem Talmud. Others claim that the text of the Mishna as it is quoted in the Babylonian Talmud is its final form and it was brought to Babylonia by Rav (Aba Arecha) after Rabbi Jehudah introduced improvements. We may also be justified in assuming that certain changes were introduced into the Mishna after the death of Rabbi Jehudah. As a result of these changes a number of corrections were made by various scholars who understood that it was impossible to preserve the original text of the Mishna without variations. The tendency to change the text is evidenced by the warning of Rabbi Jochanan (the editor of the Jerusalem Talmud) who said: “No one may add to the language which the early ones used.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי נזיר פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> Other scholars warned against confusing the names of the Tanaim and ascribing a saying of one Tana to another.

                "This practice was later engaged in by the Amoraim when they found that the Mishna conflicted with the views they were trying to prove, and the corrections remained permanent despite the accepted rule against introducing changes. This practice was more prevalent in Babylonia because “pilpul” was more popular in that country. Sometimes these changes were not incorporated into the body of the Mishna and we thus find the Jerusalem Talmud use the phrase: “The Mishna should have read otherwise”.",
                "Taking all these into consideration we may conclude that the text of the Mishna often caused misunderstandings among the scholars who failed to comprehend the original meaning.

It was at that time that Levi left Palestine and went to Nehardea.",
                "In Nehardea he gained the friendship of Aba bar Aba, the father of Shmuel Yarchinai.

When Levi died he was mourned by Aba bar Aba who pointed out the greatness of the generation of Rabbi Jehudah’s contemporaries of whom Levi was the last one. In his eulogy Aba bar Aba said: “The life of Levi ben Sisi may be compared to the story of a king who had a vineyard in which there were one hundred vines each of which yielded one hundred barrels of wine yearly. In time the vines dried up and with every passing year fewer remained until in the end there was no more than one vine left. The king loved this last vine as he once loved his whole vineyard.

            "Introduction": [
                "A<small>NY TREATISE ON THE</small> A<small>MORAIM</small> must begin with the Amoraim of Palestine who were the direct heirs of the Tanaim and the last link in the long chain of the development of the oral law which stretched from the days of the Men of the Great Synagogue down to their time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a better enlightment of the subject, we have to repeat that a teacher of the “Mishna” was called “Tana” (plural: “Tanaim”) and a teacher of the “Gemara” was called “Amora” (plural: “Amoraim”).</i> The Amoraim of Babylonia, on the other hand, marked the beginning of a new historical epoch for the Jews of that country which continued for centuries after the spark of spiritual life expired in Palestine.",
                "With the completion of the Mishna, whose authority was recognized both in Palestine and in Babylonia, the Jewish law assumed its final form. In both countries the Mishna was recognized as the deciding factor in all problems of life, but the subsequent development of the laws followed different lines in each country. None, however dared to question the interpretations of the Tanaim even when these concerned Biblical verses which had no direct relationship to religious problems.",
                "When we consider the teachings of the Tanaim and Amoraim it becomes obvious, that they sought to establish a worthy continuation to the teachings of the prophets, who aimed to elevate the ethics of the Jews to the highest possible level. They therefore interpreted the commandments of the Torah in such a manner as to inculcate the people with feelings of justice, love of peace and love of one’s neighbor. This aim caused some of the scholars to believe that study of the Torah and the fulfillment of its commandments was most important in life even though one did not agree with the commandments. Others said that after the coming of Messiah all commandments would be done with and there would no longer be any need for written laws.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">נדה ס״א ב׳, מדרש תהלים פּרשה נ״ו.</span></i>",
                "There is a Midrash extant which declares that those Jews who had left Egypt and wandered in the desert belonged to a “generation of knowledge,” because they possessed a measure of civilization and not, as might be assumed, they were untutored slaves who had just acquired freedom. Many critics ironically nod their heads at sight of this Midrash, but on closer observation of the commandments of the Torah it becomes obvious that those Jews possessed a high measure of culture.",
                "Like other civilized peoples of that time, the Jews understood the art of cloth making while still in Egypt. Even if we assume that their garments were not made of the finest stuffs, skill was nevertheless required to weave the linen of which their garments were made. They understood the art of agriculture and the various occupations involved in it such as plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, grinding and baking. They also were acquainted with animal husbandry and its attendant occupations. While still in bondage they built houses and cities and they learned to bake bricks out of clay. Woodwork, masonry, metal work, wine making and hunting were also not strange to them. They knew how to find water in the depths of the earth and how to maintain fires. They made decorations out of precious metals and they pressed oil out of olives.",
                "In their social relationships they maintained a civilized system of order which included representatives and judges, policemen and arrests. They understood how to divide time into weeks, months and years. In commerce they used money as is obvious from the stories of Abraham’s purchase of the cave of Machpelah and of Jacob’s purchase of a tract of land from the sons of Chamor for which he paid 100 Kesitah. In general we may say that the people of that time possessed a high level of intelligence and that the Jews were not behind the times. When other nations were governed by laws we may assume that the Jews did not live in lawlessness.",
                "In the case of some commandments the Torah merely added legal sanction to customs which were already practiced. Thus Rashbam (Samuel ben Meir, the grandson of Rashi) states in his interpretation to the Torah that rules governing robbery, sexual relations, covetousness, courts and hospitality were accepted among the Jews even before the Torah was granted. In this case the Torah merely strengthened the accepted conduct and insured the observance of these laws in the future.",
                "All the civilized peoples of that time, including the Jews of the period preceding the granting of the Torah, were called the “sons of Noah.” As such they only had to observe seven commandments, namely, to deal out justice, not to desecrate the name of God, not to worship idols, not to commit adultery, not to commit murder, not to rob and not to eat flesh that was cut from a living animal. Some maintain that the prohibitions against consuming the blood of a living animal, castration, witchcraft, mating different breeds of animals and planting mixed seeds were included in the above mentioned seven commandments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין נ״ו ב׳.</span></i>",
                "The Talmud declares that even Adam was commanded to obey these commandments with the exception of the one concerning eating the flesh of a living animal, since the consumption of meat was altogether prohibited until the deluge. Others said that the “sons of Noah” had thirty commandments to observe.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">חולין צ״ב א׳.</span></i> But these probably included many observances which were derived from the original seven commandments. It is quite understandable, that in order to conduct trials it was necessary to know which people to select as judges. Likewise, in the matter of adultery, regulations had to be established defining which women were forbidden. The concept of robbery also required definition since borrowing money and not repaying it and not paying the wage of a laborer were then considered to be robbery.",
                "The offering of sacrifices from animals, fowl and fruit was customary since time immemorial. Cain offered a sacrifice from the fruit of his fields and Abel offered his best sheep. After the deluge Noah erected an altar and offered sacrifices. Abraham and Jacob likewise erected altars for the offering of sacrifices. When Moses asked Pharaoh to release the Jews, he said that they had to go to the desert to offer sacrifices to God. Rabbi Saadiah Gaon declared that since sacrifices and circumcision preceded the establishment of the Sabbath, both of them superseded the Sabbath. During the later development of divine service, which at that time consisted of sacrificial offerings, the belief became accepted among many peoples that ordinary men could not fulfill this task since they were not acquainted with all the regulations governing the offerings. This caused the establishment of a separate group of people who devoted themselves solely to sacrifices and who abstained from ordinary labor. For the support of these people tithes were offered by all. Thus we find Abraham giving tithes to Malchi-Zedek, who was a priest of “the highest God”; Jacob vowed to tithe all his possessions if God would bless his journey and would provide him with bread and garments.",
                "The first born son at first performed the divine service. This procedure was also accepted among the Jews until the tabernacle was built. Later the performance of this office was taken out of the hands of the first born and was entrusted to the descendants of Aaron. Further development necessitated the establishment of a class of assistants to the descendants of Aaron and the Levites were added to the service. The priests performed the offering of sacrifices and they received the first fruit, the first born animals and similar gifts. The Levites who worked in the tabernacle were granted tithes, one-tenth of everyone’s income. Of this the Levites had to give one-tenth to the priests. But the rights of the first born were preserved in the government of the family as a representative of the father. The first born also received a double share in the inheritance. If a man had children by two wives one of whom he loved and the other he hated and the first born was a son of the despised wife, the father nevertheless had to recognize the rights of this son to a double share in the inheritance. The custom of the priests blessing the people is very ancient. The first priest to do so was Malchi-Zedek who blessed Abraham. Thus it is also related that Aaron blessed the children of Israel even before the Torah explicitly commanded him to do so.",
                "Even before the deluge Noah could differentiate between animals that were considered as clean and between those that were considered to be unclean. The Talmud questions this and the answer was given that when all the animals sought safety in the ark it admitted only one pair from some kinds of animals and seven pairs from other kinds. By this token it was known which were the clean and which the unclean animals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין ק״ח ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Soon after man began to develop family life he recognized his near relatives as part of himself. When rights of property were established he enacted laws to secure his possessions for his relations and he likewise made certain that after his death his possessions would remain within the family. In this manner laws of inheritance were established. Abraham complained to God and said: “Since you gave me no offspring, the manager of my house will inherit me.” Jews also practiced the same custom that was accepted among other peoples in denying a daughter a share in the inheritance. Every father gave his daughter her share as a dowry at the time that she was married. Since daughters could marry men of other tribes, they could not share in the inheritance of their fathers in order that the possessions of one tribe should not pass to another tribe.",
                "Long before the Torah was granted, the descendants of Abraham observed the commandment of circumcision. It may even be assumed that the descendants of Ishmael and the sons of Keturah observed this commandment with greater strictness than did the Jews who did not practice circumcision for forty years while in the desert.",
                "Among other civilized concepts man also learned to observe vows and oaths. He understood his duty of abiding by his word whether that concerned himself or others. All of these concepts civilized peoples possessed long before the Torah was given. The patriarch Abraham swore to Abimelech not to harm him or his descendants. Jacob vowed and later swore to Laban not to trespass his boundaries with evil intent.",
                "The slaughter of animals for food was always considered to be a natural procedure and was practiced from time immemorial. It may also be assumed that such slaughter was always done by cutting the throat of the animal. This form was probably adopted as a reaction against the savage method of beasts of prey which break the necks of their victims. Since the commandments of the Torah aim to refine the people and are based on mercy, it was strictly forbidden to cause unnecessary suffering to any living creature.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת קכ״ה ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Since ancient times man recognized the concepts of purity and impurity. As soon as man could esthetically comprehend the concept of cleanliness, he avoided coming in contact with things that were unclean. It was then believed that evil spirits inhabited the unclean objects and that they would gain control of the clean body which touched the impure one. Thus Jacob commanded his household when he left Shechem and said: “Cast out the strange idols from your midst, clean yourself and don other garments.” People likewise avoided coming in contact with a woman in the days of her separation, with unclean animals or insects.",
                "Bathing in water was the accepted mode of purification. In this manner all impurity was washed away. Before giving the Torah, God commanded the people to consecrate themselves and to wash their garments. This was also the reason why a proselyte had to immerse himself in water and even though he was circumcised, he was not accepted as a proselyte until after immersion. Menstruating women were also required to bathe before being considered pure. This appears to have been an ancient custom observed by all civilized peoples.",
                "There is no doubt that all of these commandments later evolved into numerous supplementary observances. With the development of society punishments were determined for infractions of these commandments. But no matter how much the scholars wanted that the commandments of the Torah should be observed, they nevertheless warned against observing a commandment at the expense of committing a sin, as in the case of obtaining an object illegally in order to do some good deed with it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות מ״ז ב׳, סוכה ל׳ א׳, בבא קמא צ״ד א׳.</span></i> But in some exceptional instances the ignoring of one commandment could aid in the fulfillment of another as when study of the Torah was interrupted in order to perform some philanthropic deed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מנחות צ״ט ב׳.</span></i>",

Nevertheless the Torah showed consideration even for the thief and the scholars declared that the reason why a thief had to pay five times the value of a stolen ox and only four times the value of a stolen sheep was that an ox can be led easily but a sheep has to be carried and this accounted for the easier punishment for one stealing a sheep.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא קמא ע״ט ב׳.</span></i>",

They sowed their fields, they engaged in various trades and they developed a highly complex Jewish cultural life.",

The Talmud is the most trustworthy of these, although it was written much later when many of the previous customs were nearly forgotten. In addition to the Talmud there are less faithful descriptions in the writings of Josephus Flavius, the geographer Strabo and the naturalist Pliny.",
                "During all these centuries the overwhelming majority of the Jews were agriculturists. These tillers of the soil were but little affected by the numerous incursions of the Romans. In the worst cases their cattle and produce were robbed but the farmers and their families were not molested. Even when the Romans were determined to destroy Judaism they understood that the farming population was the foundation of the productive forces in the country and should be spared. It is therefore certain that even when many Jews were exiled from the country the farmers were left to till their fields.",
                "It must also be borne in mind that the Jewish farmer of that time was religious more than he was patriotic. As long as the Romans did not interfere with his offering of sacrifices he was satisfied and probably indifferent whether he paid his taxes to the Jerusalem aristocrats, who looked down upon him, or whether the taxes were collected by the Romans.",
                "When the Hasmoneans ruled Palestine they acquired a number of seaports but the merchants and sailors of these cities were largely Phoenicians. Jews were then in the initial stages of learning the arts of commerce and navigation and their share in these occupations was negligible. Even the Jews of Galilee who were close neighbors of the Phoenicians excelled in agriculture and fruit growing rather than in commerce and Josephus described their land as “covered with fields of grain and resembling a large garden.”",
                "The Bible described Palestine as a land of milk and honey but this blessing was not always realized. The Biblical curse that the heavens shall be like copper over their heads and the earth shall be like iron under their feet often approached nearer the truth when periods of drought affected the land. Nevertheless the tillers of the soil always managed to secure their bread despite the fact that the country was rocky and sandy to a large degree. The Jews loved their land and each one was convinced that it was the most beautiful in the world. They learned to improve the soil and to fertilize it artificially, to clear it of stones and to destroy obnoxious weeds. The fields were surrounded with cactus fences to prevent the cattle from trampling them and those that were located on steep hills were terraced. Every handbreadth of land was utilized and there were no more diligent workers than the farmers of Palestine. Agriculture was highly regarded by all and was especially revered by the Romans. Whereas in other lands the Romans encountered difficulties in persuading the people to till the soil, Palestine farmers were happy if they were left to pursue that labor.",
                "The fertility of the soil of Palestine varied in different regions of the country. Jericho and its environs was praised by the writers of all times as “the city of dates.” Other districts excelled in wheat growing. It was said that the grain growing about the city of Ophroim attained such height that it provided sufficient straw for the needs of the whole country. The wheat of Galilee was also famous for its quality and some said that it excelled even the wheat of Judea. Rye, oats, barley, sorghum and other grains grew in abundance. Bread made out of barley meal was considered to be the staple article of food of the poorer elements. There was a great abundance of this meal and considerable quantities of it were exported to other countries from which rice was introduced and sowed in Palestine.",
                "In ordinary years the grain crop was between five and ten fold that which was sown, but in years when the rains descended in time and the sun did not scorch the germinating seed the crop reached as much as a hundred fold. In years of bumper crops Palestine exported grain, but during lean years grain had to be imported from Egypt. Palestine abounded in all kinds of greens and vegetables such as cabbage, cucumbers, onions, garlic, radishes and various beans. In time new vegetables which had not grown there previously were introduced into the country. These different kinds of vegetables were avidly consumed. Due to the stringent regulations governing the offering of sacrifices people often abstained from eating meat and indulged in it only on Sabbaths and holidays or other festive occasions. After the destruction of the temple, when the offering of sacrifices was done away with, many people gave up meat altogether as an item in their diet.",

In addition to these, new improved varieties were introduced and cultivated. Palestine was especially renowned for its wine, dates and wheat. The coins that were minted by the Hasmoneans bear ears of wheat, bunches of grapes and date palms as symbols of the fertility of the land. The vineyards of Judea were considered the most beautiful in that part of the world. Between the rows of trees and vines flowers were planted which filled the air with their fragrance. Raisins and date honey were commonly used as food. Oil, which was plentiful, was exported in great quantities, and just as Judea was renowned for its wine Galilee was famous for the quality of its oil.

After the destruction of the temple the Romans said that the Jews uprooted all the balsam trees in revenge on the Romans.",

This was especially true in the regions east of the Jordan. The women of Judea spun the wool and the women of Galilee spun flax and the garments were sold in the nearby cities. Many of the known varieties of fowl were introduced into the country at a later date. This is obvious from their Hebrew names which were never mentioned in the Bible. Geese, ducks and chickens were among the imported species and although they were not used for sacrificial purposes they were used as food. Many people also raised cattle and goats and considerable quantities of dairy products were consumed and exported.",

These were sold far and wide and were used for medical purposes and also in the manufacture of cosmetics. Historical descriptions of Palestine also mentioned metal mines. Iron was mined in the Lebanon mountains and in the region north of Idumea. Josephus Flavius mentioned an iron mountain which extended to the boundary of Moab and in later years this metal was also mined in Trans-Jordania.",

The Talmud is the best historical source on this subject and it lists the following occupations as being most widely engaged in: tailoring, shoemaking, building, quarrying, carpentry, hairdressing, metal working, weaving, dyeing, tapestry-weaving, bee raising, pottery, glass blowing, engraving, tanning, ink and arms manufacturing.",
                "But although all these trades were commonly practiced and Jewish artisans were accorded social recognition, they did not constitute a majority of the population. Farming engaged the efforts of the majority of the nation. This is evident from the fact that the Talmud devoted itself more to the interests of the farmers than it did to the interests of the artisans.",
                "From the available historical data we may conclude that the Jewish artisans could not compete with the artisans of the foreign countries and when vessels or garments of higher quality were desired they had to be imported. This conclusion is also substantiated by the fact that the Talmud refers to all superior vessels or garments by their Greek names. This was also true of vegetables for some time, but as the years went by the superior varieties were cultivated also in Palestine. However there was a common conviction that articles of foreign manufacture were superior in quality and people of means bought their garments and decorated their houses with foreign importations.",
                "Among the farming population the poorer peasants were in a majority. These were referred to in the Talmud as “Baal Habaith” and they usually possessed only a small tract of land from which they barely eked out a living. Together with the members of his family such a peasant would work in his field from dawn till sunset. Most of his produce he used for his own household and the remainder, after he paid his taxes and tithes, was marketed in the nearby cities where it was bartered or sold for money. Under such circumstances, the poorer peasants suffered every time a drought occurred or some other calamity overtook the country. He was then forced to hire out as a farm hand or to pawn his land to a richer farmer. But even when no unforseen calamities occurred, the poor peasant often had to become a wage-earner by working for another farmer. The parcelation of the land when it was being divided between the heirs left each of the heirs such a small holding that many were forced to hire out even during normal years. Those who could find no employment were forced to turn to begging or to brigandage.",
                "In Galilee and Judea there existed a small class of rich farmers who owned considerable stretches of land and had a comfortable income. It was these people who loaned money to the poorer peasants and in time increased their holdings by seizing the land in payment of outstanding debts. They were also the merchants in grain and the Talmud refers to them as <span dir=\"rtl\">״עתירי נכסין״</span> (men of much property). Although their number was small, they were socially prominent and exerted an influence on the administration of the land. They were generally the officials, the elders and members of the priestly families which accumulated the land of the poor. It is told that they engaged “Ikonomusin” (managers) and “Apitropsim” (overseers) to supervise the cultivation of their fields and vineyards while the owners remained in the city or travelled about in connection with their business ventures.",
                "Thus the Talmud relates that Rabban Gamliel II, also known as Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh, employed a great number of laborers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">דמאי פרק ג׳ משנה א׳.</span></i> and he also leased a part of his lands.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא מציעא פרק ח׳ משנה ח׳.</span></i> Such a procedure was engaged in by people who did not live on their land. Rabban Gamliel was presiding officer of the Sanhedrin and had to reside in the city. He administered his lands through the agency on an “Economos” or an “Apitropos.”",
                "Hired laborers were engaged for a definite period which may have been as much as a year or as little as a day or half a day but never for more than six years. Among the laborers there were men who owned small plots of land as well as those who owned no land at all. Those unskilled in agricultural work hired out as common laborers and engaged in the most difficult work.",
                "The scholars always sided with the laborers when they had complaints against their employers. They also established definite regulations concerning the food and drink to which the laborers were entitled, and although it is possible that most of these rules defining the rights of the workers remained theoretical, it is nevertheless certain that the social differentiation between poor and rich was not as sharp among the Jews as it was among the other nations of that time. The persecution at the hands of the Gentiles to which Jews poor and rich were subject partly accounted for this state of affairs.",
                "Contract farming was also a known phenomenon. A contractor would undertake to cultivate a field and he was responsible for all the operations. He would buy the seed, hire the laborers and work together with them. He was responsible for the payment of the taxes to the government and the tithes to the priests as well as for all other expenditures. In compensation he received half the crop. In addition there were “Arisim” (tenants) who received the seed, the tools and the animals required for cultivation from the owner. Tenants supplied only their labor.",
                "Artisans and peasants in Palestine were free men. They could choose their own occupation and when they hired out they were free to leave at any time and the employer was legally bound to pay whatever wage was coming to them for the work which they had accomplished. The condition of the slaves was entirely different. In some respects the slaves were in a better position than the hired laborers but socially they occupied the lowest level. The slave was assured of his food and shelter, but he was not free to choose his occupation and he was dependent on the whims of his owner who could force him to work day and night.",
                "The condition of the Jewish slave was peculiar. It was only on rare occasions that a Jew bought a Jewish slave. When the Gentiles from the surrounding countries brought Jewish slaves to sell, they were ransomed and immediately freed. But there were occasions when a Jew was in debt and he voluntarily sold himself into slavery to be able to repay his debt. Similarly, when a man was caught stealing and he had to pay twice the value of the article stolen, the court would sell him into slavery if he could not pay the required sum. Like the artisan and farm laborer, the Jewish slave sold only his labor power, but he did not have definite working hours and he could be called upon to perform some task at any hour of the day or night. However, he enjoyed the privilege of resting on the Sabbath and the holidays together with his owner.",
                "Because of the preferred treatment which the owner had to accord a Jewish slave there were not many that were anxious to own them, and a statement current at the time declared that “He who buys a Jewish slave buys an overlord.” But there undoubtedly existed slave owners who did not grant their Jewish slaves any privileges and on the year of the Jubilee the courts had to force them to liberate their Jewish slaves. Human nature did not change much during the centuries and it is apparent that the generations of the time of the Talmud had to contend with the same problem that was recorded by Jeremiah (Ch. 34) that king Zedekiah commanded that all Jewish slaves be liberated and their owners soon enslaved them again.",
                "Jewish slave owners were enjoined to treat their non-Jewish slaves with humaneness. Although the owner could beat his slave at will he was strictly warned not to starve him, and in case the slave was crippled through the loss of an eye or a limb, he was immediately liberated. If a slave died as a result of a beating, the Torah commanded that the owner be put to death; but when the slave survived his punishment by a day or more, the owner was not to be put to death.",
                "Judging from numerous circumstances we may conclude that Jewish slaves felt a greater kinship to their owners than the non-Jewish slaves. They participated actively in the various rebellions against Rome and Josephus relates that during the war which ended with the destruction of the temple Bar Giora proclaimed the liberation of all Jewish slaves as the first step in his mobilization of an army. At the same time the Romans announced that all non-Jewish slaves who would betray their owners would be granted their freedom.",
                "Non-Jewish slaves were brought from the markets of Tyre and Sidon. Their treatment in Palestine could compare favorably with their treatment in other countries. Every slave was branded on the forehead or he was given a cap with a bell on it to wear that he might be recognized. Compared with the treatment of slaves in other lands, these measures were relatively humane.",
                "Slaves were the unrestricted property of their owners. If the owner so desired he could marry a slave to his mother or sister. But the marriage of a slave was of no significance and the owner retained his rights of possession. Children of slaves also belonged to the owner and could be sold at will. All possessions of a slave automatically belonged to his master who also claimed any object found by the slave. In addition the owner could rent the labor power of his slaves to others without consulting the slaves.",
                "The Midrash relates the case of a man who persuaded his neighbor to divorce his wife because of her immoral conduct. When the husband complained that he could not divorce her because he did not have enough money to pay her dowry, the man offered to loan him the necessary sum. After the woman was divorced the creditor married her and enslaved her previous husband for inability to repay his debt. The man thus became the slave of his ex-wife and he was forced to witness her relations with his creditor.",
                "But if the position of the male slave was unenviable, the condition of the women slaves was even worse. In addition to their labor they were held at the disposal of the owner and his sons. It is therefore remarkable that some women were sold by their own parents into such life.",
                "There undoubtedly were many Jews who treated their slaves in a more humane manner. In many homes the slaves were employed in skilled work and were trusted with all confidence. Some of them were tailors or barbers; others were bakers and cooks. In some cases the owners even entrusted the education of their children to the slaves. Among the women slaves there were singers and dancers who entertained their owners and their guests.",
                "The Mishna tells that Rabban Gamliel of Jabneh owned a slave named Tabbai whom he respected greatly and for whom he mourned a long time after his death. Another slave of Rabban Gamliel was called “father” and his wife was referred to as “mother.” It is quite probable that these were not isolated instances and that the lot of the slave of a Jew was better than that of a non-Jewish owner.",

                "It must be borne in mind that the whole Jewish people was not mourning constantly for the destruction of the temple and the cessation of the sacrifices. It is even related that when Jerusalem was destroyed the people of Betar celebrated the occasion. It is also quite certain that the institution of sacrifices had lost much of its significance in the minds of many leaders and some of them were satisfied that Jabneh had been saved as a cultural center. Others, however, were convinced that the destruction of the temple was temporary and that it would soon be restored even as the first temple was rebuilt a short time after its destruction. This belief found a deep echo in the hearts of large sections of the population who looked upon themselves as people whose house had been burned and who were waiting for the construction of a new house. There is also no definite proof that the institution of sacrifices ceased with the temple and that small groups did not gather secretly to offer sacrifices. It is even possible that they brought their offerings on the site of the demolished altar. The fact that the regulations pertaining to the priests and the tithes were observed for a long time after the destruction is ample proof of the expectations of the people of a rapid restoration.",
                "This was not an impossibility under the political conditions then prevailing. It was quite likely that some emperor would grant permission to rebuild the temple out of respect for the Jews or through the intercession of some influential person who could also pay for the right. But these hopes vanished with the rebellion of Bar Kochba against Hadrian. Over half a million Jews were killed in the uprising and hundreds of thousands of others were sold into slavery. The country was devastated and a temple to Zeus was erected in Jerusalem. Jews were not even allowed to approach the gates of the city.",
                "But this was not the final expulsion from Palestine. Jews continued to reside in other cities and subsequent Roman emperors allowed them to visit Jerusalem on the ninth day of Ab to mourn for the destroyed temple.",
                "Various historical events of that time are described in the Jerusalem as well as in the Babylonian Talmud and also in the Midrash. Most of these descriptions were not clearly understood until a recent date when certain Jewish historians made a careful study of these sources. Whenever the Talmudic descriptions are not in agreement with the facts as they are related by Roman historians it is safer to rely on the Talmudic sources.",
                "That the destruction which followed the conquest of Jerusalem by Titus was not complete was also a result of other factors. Many people did not actively participate in the rebellion and after the war they rearranged their lives to conform with the situation that had been created and they maintained peace with the Romans. But the zealots who participated in the war were branded as bandits after the conflict. Their desparation in the struggle also harmed the interests of the people and hastened the ultimate destruction.",
                "Titus and the rulers that immediately followed him did not intend to interfere with the religious practices of the Jews. According to Josephus, Titus even commanded that the temple be spared and it was the princess Berenice who set fire to it out of conviction that the Jews would never surrender as long as it remained in existence. After the revolt was quelled Titus did not wish to do any further harm. In all religious matters the Jews remained free and they retained the right of judgment in religious and also in secular cases. Even non-Jews often appeared before a Jewish court when in dispute with a Jew and the Roman authorities allowed Jewish courts to handle all cases when both parties consented to be tried by it. The Church-father Origines even declared that Jewish courts tried cases involving life although they were not authorized to do so.",
                "The teachings of the Pharisees then developed to an extent which would have been impossible had the temple been in existence. The Sadducees disappeared altogether and the oral law became the dominant influence in Jewish life. All national life concentrated about the religious regulations which were strictly observed. In their devotion to the Torah and in the observance of its commandments the people found consolation for the destruction of the temple; Jabneh took the place of Jerusalem and the offering of gifts to the scholars in Jabneh took the place of the offering of sacrifices on an altar.",
                "Sixty years after the destruction of Jerusalem, during the reign of Hadrian, another uprising took place which affected the whole people. The cause of this uprising is sought in the events which occurred during the reign of the preceding emperor Trajan. During his reign Babylonia rebelled against Rome and the Jews extended aid to the insurgents. (The Talmud refers to this revolt as “Polemos Quietus.”) A number of Jews from Palestine also joined this uprising in the hope that the defeat of the Romans would lead to the liberation of Palestine.",
                "Trajan entrusted the conduct of the war to general Lucius Quietus and he commanded him to execute all Jews that would fall into his hands. After he quelled the revolt, Quietus was appointed governor of Palestine. Uprisings of the Jews occurred simultaneously in Egypt, Cyrenaica and Cyprus and the rebels vented their pent up anger on the neighboring Greek population and slaughtered many of them. Greek authors of that time speak of hundreds of thousands of slain Greeks, but these numbers were undoubtedly highly exaggerated. Marcius Turba was dispatched to quell the revolt and he triumphed over the Jews in “Bikat Yadaim” (Alexandria). A Talmudic legend describes the slaughter that followed and states that twice as many people as left Egypt were killed at that time.",
                "Hadrian was by nature a peace loving and kindly man and he is said to have permitted the restoration of the temple, but the Samaritans objected to such a step and he withdrew his permission. One legend states that when the foundations for the new temple were being excavated flames burst out from the diggings and consumed the laborers. The Jews then asked that the work be stopped because of their belief that this was an omen of God’s desire that the temple should not be rebuilt. However, it has been historically established that the relations between the Samaritans and the Jews during the reign of Hadrian were friendly and they also participated on the side of the Jews during the uprising.",
                "Recent historical investigations ascribe the rebellion to Hadrian’s prohibition against circumcision. Both the Jews and the Samaritans observed the law of circumcision and they therefore united against Rome. It seems inexplicable why the Romans, who did not interfere with the religious customs of the subject peoples, should have prohibited circumcision, but the Christian historian Schuerer explains this in the following manner: Emperor Domitian issued a law against castration as a barbaric custom. This law Hadrian extended to include circumcision and the death penalty was established for those who broke the law. This explanation is obviated by the fact that Antoninus Pius again allowed the Jews to practice circumcision and his edict declared the practice to be an old Jewish custom and not to be confused with castration. In issuing this edict he was also influenced by the stubborness with which the Jews clung to this practice.",

                "When Moses sent spies to Palestine they reported that the cities of Palestine were well fortified (Numbers, 13:28). Moses informed the Jews that they would find “cities great and fenced up to heaven” (Deut. 9:1). It is therefore remarkable that after so many invasions and wars the people believed that many of the gates and fortresses dated back to the days of Joshua ben Nun. The Bible mentions that the Jews lived in “Ir” (city), “Chatzer” (court) and “Kefar” (village). The Talmud makes no mention of “Chatzer” but contains the additional concept of “Kerach” (large city) and in addition to the “Ir” (city) it makes mention of “Ayarah” (town). There are differing opinions concerning the exact meaning of “Chatzer”. Some declared it to be a suburb; others maintained that it referred to an enclosure or a group of houses where a large number of people lived. We also find references to cities named “Hatzar” (Numbers, 34:4; Joshua, 19:3), and these probably developed from small groups of houses. The name “Kefar” appears both in the Bible and in the Talmud. The size of a “Kefar” (village) was not definitely determined but Josephus declares that the smallest “Kefar” in Palestine contained fifteen thousand inhabitants. However, his statement may be discounted as exaggerated. There were also cities in Palestine which developed from villages as is indicated by their names: “Kefar Haamoni,” “Kefar Hananiah” and “Kefar Aziz.”",
                "When the scholars tried to define the difference between a city and a village they said that a city is a place where there are always ten “Batlonim” (idlers) available for various religious functions which require that number.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מגלה ג׳ ב׳.</span></i>",
                "The name “Kerach” was derived from the Aramaic. The name signifies a fortified city. The Talmud sometimes refers to the same city by all three names (Kerach, Ir, Kefar), but it is obvious that “Ir” usually referred to an unfortified city.",
                "The fortified “Kerach” was surrounded by a wall as protection against sudden attacks and was generally situated on the top of a mountain or on a rocky hill which was difficult of access and could be easily defended. Whenever an “Ir” was fortified it was expressly referred to as a walled city.",
                "A “Kerach” was limited in area by its walls and could not grow indefinitely; the name therefore described the strength of the city and not its size. Whenever we find statements such as “the great Kerach of Rome” these refer to the defenses of the city rather than to its size.",
                "The Talmud relates that when God wanted to determine the size of Jerusalem the angels said: “You have created so many Kerachim of the Gentile nations without determining their size. Why should you do so for your own city?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא בתרא ע״ה ב׳.</span></i> This legend is interpreted by some to indicate that “Kerach” referred to Gentile cities or to those whose garrisons were largely non-Jewish.

                "The walled cities of Palestine were thus named “Kerachim” and were considered as Gentile places of residence. There were ten such cities which bore the collective name of Decapolis.

This was also a distinction between a “Kerach” and an “Ir” which was not autonomous. The “Kerach” contained garrisons; this is evident from the reference of the Talmud to “Burganin,” that means the barracks which housed the soldiers or the government tax collector.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת ק״ג ב׳.</span></i>",
                "This fact explains the Talmudic saying that a man who is about to enter a “Kerach” should pronounce the following prayer: “May it be Thy will to lead me into this Kerach in peace.” Once within the city one was supposed to recite another prayer which said: “I am thankful to You that You brought me into the city in peace.” Upon leaving, one said: “May it be Thy will to lead me out of this city in peace,” and after one was out of the limits of the city he was to say: “I thank You for leading me out of the city in peace and I pray that You shall further lead me and protect me in peace and that You shall save me from any enemy who may lurk by the roadside.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ס׳ א׳.</span></i>",

But despite the danger, Jews constantly had to visit these cities because of their business enterprises. Sometimes they only had to pass through these cities, as in the case af sea journeys when the ships touched at these ports. The scholars therefore at times forbade entrance into these cities or even into towns which were located in their neighborhood, but these prohibitions were usually ignored out of necessity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תוספתא עבודה זרח פרק א׳.</span></i>",
                "Even wicked kings who ruled the land with brutal force and persecuted the Jewish religion could gain the admiration of the people by building a new city. This act was enough to justify many of his cruel deeds in the eyes of the people.

Jochanan thus declared that the area occupied contained 600,000 cities each of which was inhabited by 600,000 people. The total number would thus be larger than the population of the whole world today. Similar exaggerations we find in the writing of Josephus who said that there were 1200 cities in Galilee alone and in the writings of the Greek historian Dio Casius who related that during the uprising of Bar Kochba the Romans conquered 950 fortified cities.",
                "We may conclude, however, that the large cities were subdivided into quarters each of which was significant in itself. From the descriptions of ancient Jerusalem we know that the city was divided into an upper and a lower part. During the time that we are dealing with, Jerusalem was in ruins and uninhabited, and when the scholars attempted to describe the beauty of the city they relied upon their imagination of the Jerusalem of the future after Messiah would come. But the descriptions of ancient Jerusalem were not exaggerated. The image of the city lived in the memory of all the people and they sought to make the other cities resemble Jerusalem in appearance. Most of the Palestine cities were built on mountain tops and the synagogues were erected at the highest point so as to be seen from all sides. The court which dispensed justice and controlled the observance of the commandments of the Torah also held its sessions there. The academies were located nearby and the sexton of the synagogue blew the Shofar there to announce the beginning of the Sabbath. The watch tower was also located in that vicinity to observe the countryside over a great distance and to announce the coming of an enemy.",
                "Nearly all Palestine cities had suburbs which were called in Hebrew “Migrash” or “Parvar” (Kings II, 23:11). Houses in these suburbs were part of the cities for purposes of taxation and maintenance of order, but in time of war they were abandoned except such houses as bordered on the city walls.",
                "The scholars established a rule by which all inhabitants of a city were compelled to build a wall with gates about the city. This rule was enforced in those towns that were near the border of the country and were subject to attacks. Every city also had one or more market places and was traversed by streets.",
                "Speaking of the greatness of Jerusalem, a Midrash relates that the city contained twenty-four palaces each of which had 24 entrances. Near every entrance there were 24 large market places, each of which was divided into 24 small ones.

                "As a result of the limited space within the walled area, houses were built close together and some of them were built into the protecting walls. Such houses generally served as gates to the city.

                "Life in the cities differed greatly from that in the villages so far as food, clothing and general behavior was concerned. Life in the cities was more refined in all its aspects when compared to the primitive mode of life in the villages. For the convenience of the city dwellers there were markets and hostelries where food supplies were sold and travellers were accommodated. These two institutions also served as the foundation for commerce in the country. On certain days of the week the villagers would bring their produce to the cities and would buy those necessities which they could not raise themselves. These market days were called <span dir=\"rtl\">ימי הכניסח</span> (days of entrance) and occurred on Mondays and Thursdays. In honor of the visitors a chapter from the Torah would be read in the synagogue on those days and other religious needs of the villagers would be fulfilled. The court held its sessions and the scholars lectured on religious questions. Friday was another market day when the villagers brought food supplies such as fowl, cattle, fish and wine for the Sabbath. The artisans also had their shops in the city and the villagers paid them for their labor with their farm produce. Among these were also the scribes, the doctors and the teachers.",

It was only rarely that the villagers possessed any money. Cities were generally built near a supply of water, but when there were no springs or wells in the vicinity, water would be brought in pipes or aqueducts from some distance. Many cities also had reservoirs to store water in anticipation of drought or the drying up of wells and the people knew how to utilize water pressure to raise it to higher levels. Some cities had canals for drainage purposes and these canals were also used to bring the water to the fields for irrigation purposes. Wells were provided with buckets for raising the water.",

Stores provided the city dwellers with all their needs in addition to the markets. These stores contained all possible articles including arms.

He presented the synagogue at Tiberias with a golden Menorah and he gave the Nasi a large field for the maintenance of his pupils.

Many of the scholars therefore spoke against the Nasi and on one occasion, as they studied the laws pertaining to a Nasi who commits a transgression, Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish asked: “If a Nasi has committed a transgression, should he be flogged or not?” He was answered that a court of three judges could condemn such a Nasi to be flogged and that it was not even necessary to convoke the small Sanhedrin of 23 members to try him.",

Church-father Epiphanos thus saved the history of these N’siim from oblivion even as Josephus saved for future generations the chronicle of many of the events which transpired during the time of the second temple. Epiphanos appeared to have been born a Jew and he described the history of the N’siim in the belief that those were the last days of the Jewish faith. In this respect he also resembled Josephus who believed that he was writing the history of a people doomed to extinction.",

His decisions in religious matters were binding. The Nasi had to assist in the collection of the taxes from the Jews and he had the right to collect money for the needs of his household. He also had the right to ordain his disciples and to excommunicate those who joined the Christians.",
                "Until the year 325 (C.E.) the Christians were considered to be a Jewish sect and they had a large following in the country. Debates between the orthodox and Christian Jews were a common occurrence and both groups sought substantiation for their beliefs in the Bible.",
                "Oppressed by heavy taxes and other political and economic persecutions, the condition of the people grew worse from day to day but their spirit was not broken as long as their religious life could continue in its traditional channels. In this respect the situation took a radical turn for the worse with the accession of Constantine to the throne of Rome (306-337). Constantine embraced Christianity and established it as the state religion. Persecution of the Jews on religious grounds was then intensified. The council of the Christian Patriarchs was then held at Nicea and this gathering severed all bonds with the Jews. The emperor lent his aid to the Christian church in its persecution of all other religions. Constantine II who ruled together with the co-emperor Gallus (337-349) revived the policies of Hadrian in not allowing the Jews to practice their religious commandments. Gallus was especially known for his brutality to the Jews. Upon his return from a war in the east he laid waste the southern half of the country, and it seemed that this region which contained many educational institutions headed by the disciples of Rabbi Jehudah, would never be rebuilt",
                "Under these circumstances the secular power of the N’siim was diminished to a minimum. The population lost much of its interest in legal matters and devoted itself primarily to Hagada with its fantastic interpretations. The scholars of Palestine lost the creative powers of the previous generations. There was also not much time to devote to such matters, for everyone was concerned with finding a way to escape from the country. The population became impoverished and Rabbi Levi said: “Years ago, when people had money they were interested in the Mishna, Halacha and Talmud; but now that they are poor they do not want to hear of legal matters and are only interested in blessings and consolation.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שיר השירים רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא י״ב.</span></i>",

They did not seek to solve the problems which arose in their day, nor did they ponder the words of their predecessors. They were satisfied to know the simple meaning of the laws which they had received.",

The new calendar was to be permanent and all holidays were to be determined by it. The book of genealogy lists the following as the last N’siim: R. Hillel II, R. Gamliel V, R. Jehudah N’siah IV, and R. Gamliel VI (or Bathraah—the last). About sixty years passed from the time of Hillel II till R. Gamliel the VI, and this period was a very difficult one since it coincided with the rise of Christianity to power.",
                "The political decline of the Jews began during the reign of Constantine the Great and continued at an eccelerating pace. During the first years of his rule Constantine was quite tolerant to the Jews and he repealed the limitations which were imposed by Diocletian. He was then convinced that every man should have the right to choose his own faith and he also freed the Jewish scholars and all “the servants of the synagogue” from payment of taxes to the government. He recognized the Nasi as the head of the Jewish religious community and teachers of Jewish law were commanded to obey his edicts. But this liberalism of the emperor was not of long duration and soon after he embraced Christianity, he fell under the influence of religious fanatics and he was guided by them in his policies toward the Jews. The emperor’s religious advisers followed the leadership of Bishop Sylvester of Rome, Bishop Paul of Byzantium and Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea. It was they who called the attention of the emperor to the belief that the Jews were a cursed and forsaken people condemned to suffering. They insisted that since the emperor had seen the light and had embraced the only true faith, he had to abstain from the sin of protecting the Jews.",
                "Constantine then ruled that Jews could not convert others to their faith, and if they did, both parties were to be punished. A free man who embraced Judaism was to lose all his property and a non-Jewish slave who was circumcised against his will was to be liberated. If a Jew who embraced Christianity was persecuted by other Jews, his tormentors were to be burned at the stake.",
                "All these years of persecution were only broken for a brief moment by the short-lived reign of Julian the Apostate who ruled for 18 months (Nov. 361—June 363). In his struggle against Christianity Julian befriended the Jews. He reduced the burden of their taxes, he did not allow them to be insulted and he called the Nasi “Honored friend and brother.” In a letter to the Nasi Rabbi Hillel, he promised to improve the condition of the Jews and to permit the rebuilding of the temple after his return from the war with the Persians.",
                "After Hillel II the post of Nasi was occupied by his son Gamliel V. The Christian Church-father Hieronymus relates that Emperor Theodosius the Great, who ruled from 378 till 395, took the part of the Nasi against the Roman consul in Palestine, who infringed upon his rights, and had him executed.",
                "R. Gamliel V was succeeded by Rabbi Jehudah N’siah IV. The son of Rabbi Jehudah, Rabbi Gamliel VI, was the last Nasi. In his time the Roman empire was divided into two parts—eastern Rome with the capital at Constantinople (395-1453) and western Rome with its old capital (395-476). Rabbi Gamliel the last is mentioned in the decrees of emperor Honorius (395-424) and of Theodosius II (408-450).",
                "There is also in existence a decree of the year 426 which commands that all the payments which the Jews of Palestine made to the Nasi should henceforth be paid to the imperial treasury. This decree was probably issued at the death of Rabbi Gamliel. Rabbi Gamliel the Sixth died childless and with him the dynasty of Hillel came to an end.",
                "Thus we find that although the Nasi was recognized by the government at all times his significance in the eyes of the Jews diminished toward the end. In religious matters he was no longer the highest authority and his political influence with the Roman officials was negligible. His only important religious functions were the consecration of the new month, the sending of messengers to report the appearance of the new moon, questioning the witnesses and the determination of the holidays and the leap years. Traditionally all of these had to be determined in the presence of the Great court in Palestine in order to be valid.",
                "The Romans frequently seized the messengers that were sent to announce these matters to the scholars in Babylonia which was outside the boundaries of the Roman empire. Whenever caught the messengers were hanged and few people volunteered for such dangerous work. Although the Babylonian scholars could calculate the time of the holidays and the leap years, they were not allowed by tradition to determine these occasions on the basis of their calculations. Thus it once occurred that throughout the month of Adar it was impossible to send messengers to Babylonia to announce that a leap year had been declared. Only late in the summer there were found people who were willing to risk their lives in this mission and the Babylonian Jews observed the month of Ab twice in order that the New Year might coincide with that in Palestine. The messengers were given a letter written in code so that in case they were caught the Romans should not be able to understand its contents. The letter read and was interpreted as follows: “A pair (two witnesses) came from Reketh (Tiberias) and they were caught by the eagle (the Romans) who found in their possession things that are made in Luz (Tzitzith). Through God’s mercy and because of their own merit they escaped in peace (from the hands of the Romans). The descendants of Nachshon (the Nasi who was descended from the tribe of Judah) wanted to decide upon a crescent (declare a leap year), but the Idumean (the Roman) did not permit them. But the men of the assemblies gathered and declared a crescent for the month that Aaron died (the month of Ab).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין י״ב א׳.</span></i>",
                "The function of determining new months and leap years lent some prestige to the Nasi and he had to be looked up to as the religious leader. But when Rabbi Hillel II established a permanent calendar he did away with the last important role of the Nasi. The office of Nasi thus became an empty title. The government looked upon the Nasi as upon a Jewish official, but the Jews could see no use in maintaining the office. Emperor Theodosius issued a decree that “whoever insults the Nasi should be heavily punished.” From other sources we may conclude that this decree was aimed primarily at the Jews.",
                "We have previously recounted some of the laws promulgated by Constantine against the Jews, especially in relation to their attitude toward converts to Christianity. When he was informed that the Jews were planning a revolt against Rome he issued a decree prohibiting them from approaching the gates of Jerusalem. He also exhibited a certain sense of justice in not repealing a previous order which freed scholars and servants of the synagogue from taxes. In 336 he also ruled that Jews who embraced Christianity must not insult or do harm to their previous co-religionists.",
                "This law was very timely because new converts to Christianity persecuted the Jews, and before the latter could get redress from the governor or the emperor, much harm was accomplished. Such was the case of one Joseph of Tiberias who was considered to be one of the scholars of the court of the Nasi. The Nasi trusted him and sent him to gather the offerings of the people. When Joseph came to Cilicia in Asia Minor, it became obvious from his lectures that he was no longer an adherent of Judaism and the people would pay no attention to him. Joseph then said that he had been thrown into a river and was only saved through a miracle. After he openly embraced Christianity, the priests interceded for him with the emperor and he was appointed in charge of the new converts. Utilizing the confidence of the Emperor, Joseph fabricated numerous false stories about the Nasi and he particularly tried to convince the emperor that the Jews were planning revolt.",
                "The rumor of a planned revolt must have been based on some truth. We find that in 351 an attempt was made to overthrow the Romans. The records of that rebellion, both Jewish and non-Jewish, are very inadequate, but even from these meager sources we can obtain a picture of the events.",
                "The uprising began in the city of Sephoris which was a natural fortress. The Jews overwhelmed the Roman garrison of that city on a dark night and with the weapons which they seized they attacked other cities and succeeded in capturing Tiberias and Lud. Constantine II (350-361) dispatched several legions which subdued the uprising and mercilessly persecuted the rebels. Sephoris was destroyed entirely. Tiberias, Lud and southern Palestine were laid waste. The pursuit of the rebels continued until they were annihilated.",
                "The Roman commander Arsikanus was especially severe with the inhabitants of Sephoris who were forced to hide in the caves about Tiberias.

                "Because of the great perils that attended the announcement of the new months and leap years Rabbi Hillel II decided to do away with the traditional procedure and he established a permanent calendar. It was thus no longer necessary to question witnesses concerning the appearance of the new moon nor to send messengers to announce the findings to the Jews of foreign countries. In the matter of holidays, Jews in foreign countries were freed from the decisions of the “Great Court” in Palestine."

It was the aim of the Hagada to inspire the people with higher moral concepts and to revive their courage during times of oppression.",
                "Throughout the numerous generations of Amoraim there were many scholars who underestimated the worth of the Hagada and even opposed it. Such opposition, however, remained ineffective. The demands of the people were stronger than scholastic theories. The masses yearned for words of consolation and they eagerly listened to the teachings of the Hagada.",
                "The economic and social pressure which resulted from the political developments, the constant impoverishment of the people and the burden of submission to foreign rulers weakened the interest in Halacha. A much more receptive attitude was maintained toward Hagada which caressed the fantasy and in times of sorrow it inspired hope for a brighter future. Even during the brief intermission when the situation of the Jews of Palestine improved, as during the reign of Alexander Severus, Rabbi Jehudah, then Nasi, complained of the suffering inflicted by the government which forced him to take the last earnings of the people for the payment of taxes. In an attempt to increase its taxes, the Roman government once issued an edict that Jews should cultivate their fields on the Sabbatical year and the scholars had to give their consent, otherwise the people would have been unable to pay their taxes.",
                "But such respites in the long chain of oppression which did occur were short lived and were intended to allow the people to recuperate and to prepare them to bear patiently the decrees that inevitably followed. It is also remarkable that the rich as well as the poor suffered equally whenever the Romans intensified their oppression. The rich were sentenced to death for not giving all that was asked of them and the poor met a similar fate for not having anything to give.",
                "All of these facts we learn from casual remarks in the Talmud and the Midrashim which are attached to various legal opinions. The scholars of that time did not appreciate the importance of recording the events, and when it was remarked that future generations would not know what had occurred, the answer was given that “even if we should want to record everything we could not do so.”",
                "Considering the unbearable position of the Jews at that time, it is therefore quite understandable why they thirsted for consoling words and why they so eagerly turned to the Hagada. But the masses of the people were not alone in this respect; their leaders also sought momentary respite from the bitterness of their fate. The Hagada offered them all that. It promised a glorious future for the Jews, it taught them to value their faith, and it assured divine justice and retribution for all the wrongs that they were suffering. The Hagada extolled the virtues of the Jewish nation; it listed the virtues of the Torah and of those who adhered to it; it related the events of the past and inspired courage to face the future.",
                "Not all the legends that were repeated by the scholars were written down and many of them were lost. Others were not concerned with problems of conduct and were considered unimportant. But all those legends that have come down to us are a rich source of ethical maxims and words of wisdom with a definite lesson for every eventuality. In addition they also explain many passages of the Bible which would otherwise remain inexplicable. Some of the legends may appear to be of minor worth today, but this is due to the fact that we do not understand them. Others are based on events of which we have no record or on events which we cannot conceive of today.",
                "The authors of the Hagada are usually known as the <span dir=\"rtl\">רבנן דאגדתא</span> (teachers of the Hagada). Some of these also engaged in legal discussions and looked to the Hagada as a means of refreshing the minds of their pupils when they showed signs of weariness of the “Sophistry.” There were some scholars who looked at the teachers of Hagada with a lack of respect; they refused to call them “Rabbi” and merely referred to them as “the men of Hagada.”",
                "Aside from the above mentioned purposes the Hagada also served to protect the Jews from Christian teachings which became common at that time. It taught them how to answer and to refute the arguments of the Christians which were based on the Bible. As long as the Christians were considered to be a Jewish sect and they preached moral principles which did not threaten the fundamental tenets of the faith, they were tolerated. But when they began to claim that God had repudiated the Torah and for this reason he had destroyed the temple they became a menace to the Jewish religion. When the Christians sent apostles to win the nations to their faith and these apostles were successful because they repudiated the Sabbath, the laws of cleanliness and circumcision, the scholars feared that Jews also might be misled.",
                "One must also bear in mind that the Jewish method of interpreting the Bible was also used by many Christians of that time. The difference consisted in that the Hagada never assumed the authority of law among Jews while many of the principles of Christianity were founded on such interpretations. Not only Jewish born Christians but also non-Jews who embraced Christianity employed this method of expounding the Old and the New Testaments and even in their attacks on Jews they based themselves on the texts of the Bible.",

Likewise he said that when the animals were created they were powerless to do any harm and only the sin of Adam bestowed this power upon them. Another time he declared that when God said to Adam “Where art thou?” it might seem that He did not know where Adam was, but in reality He said so in order to begin a conversation with Adam and to give him an opportunity to repent.",

It is obvious, however, that most of these interpretations were taken from Jewish sources.",

But the moral life he held to be “even more important than the study of the Torah.” He sought to explain and to justify the sins of the leaders of the nation.

                "At a certain period of Rabbi Jochanan’s life it was forbidden to the Jews to determine the month through lunar observation and the Romans were especially strict in preventing them from celebrating their holidays. At the same time the observance of the Sabbath was not interfered with. Under the influence of Rabbi Jochanan the court in Tiberias therefore decided to observe the Day of Atonement on a Sabbath, although it really occurred on a week day, in order to deceive the Romans.

We find an explanation of this hinted in the statement of Rabbi Jochanan who said that the angels gather about God and ask him: “When is the New Year and when is the Day of Atonement?” and God answers them: “Why do you ask me? Let us go to the Court on earth and we will find out.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי ראש השנה פרק א׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i> By this statement he meant to imply that the court in Tiberias had the complete right to determine holidays as it saw fit under the circumstances.",

But the sick man replied: “I do not want the suffering nor its reward.” “Then give me your hand,” Rabbi Jochanan said. Rabbi Chama gave him his hand and he was healed.",

We have a rule that it is all the same whether one studies much or little and that only the good intention counts. Do you weep because you cannot earn your livelihood?

But the figure which he saw bathing was not a woman. Instead it was Rabbi Jochanan who remarked to him that such unusual strength as he seemed to possess should rightfully be devoted to the Torah. Resh Lakish replied: “Such beauty as you possess, should belong to a woman.” Rabbi Jochanan is said to have told him: “If you will turn to learning, I will give you my sister, who is more beautiful than I am, for a wife.” Resh Lakish then promised to give up his occupation and to turn to learning and he married the sister of Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא מציעא פּ״ד א׳.</span></i>",

                "Rabbi Chanina was born in Babylonia and he came to Palestine to study with Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi after he was already the father of a son whom he brought with himself. He then settled in Sephoris where the academy of Rabbi Jehudah was situated, but for some unknown reason he was not liked by the inhabitants of the city. Thus it was related that an epidemic once broke out in Sephoris, but it did not affect the street where Rabbi Chanina resided. The people were angered and said that he refused to pray for them, but Rabbi Chanina denied that his prayer could be of any avail as long as they conducted themselves immorally. Another time a drought occurred and although a fast day was declared no rain fell. Rabbi Chanina was then blamed and it was said that because he spoke evil of the people, God refused to heed their prayers.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי תענית פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>",
                "When Rabbi Chanina arrived in Palestine, he was already well versed in the Scriptures, but this knowledge hindered his career, for it incurred the displeasure of Rabbi Jehudah, whom he once corrected. Rabbi Jehudah at that time remarked: “Where and from whom have you learned until now?” “From Rav Hamnuna the Scribe,” Rabbi Chanina replied. “Then go to Rav Hamnuna and have him ordain you,” Rabbi Jehudah exclaimed.",
                "Only when the Nasi was nearing his death, did he command his son Rabban Gamliel to ordain Rabbi Chanina and to seat him in the first row in the academy. But Rabbi Chanina refused the last honor saying that Rabbi Ephes was older and therefore deserved the foremost seat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות ק״ג ב׳.</span></i> Rabbi Chanina believed that this act accounted for his long life and health, for even after he was eighty years of age, he could balance himself on one foot while removing his shoes.

He repeated this also when Rabban Simeon, the son of the Nasi, entered in the middle of the reading, but when Rabbi Chanina entered, he refused to begin the chapter anew.

                "Rabbi Chanina maintained a close friendship with nearly all the contemporary Amoraim.

Due to differences of opinion with Rabbi Chanina, Rabbi Jochanan left Sephoris and settled in Tiberias,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי ביצה פרק א׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i> but these differences did not weaken their friendship and Rabbi Jochanan often visited his master in Sephoris.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ויקרא רבה פּרשה כ״א פּיסקא ז׳.</span></i> When Rabbi Chanina fell sick before his death, Rabbi Jochanan went to visit him, but on the road he met a man of Sephoris and he asked him: “What new things have happened in your city?” and the man replied: “A great rabbi died and everybody is hurrying to the funeral.” Rabbi Jochanan then understood that Rabbi Chanina had died and he rent his garments as a sign of mourning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ב׳ הלכה י״א.</span></i> Others told that Rabbi Jochanan carried thirteen garments to wear and that he tore all of them exclaiming: “The man who nourished me with Torah has gone.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מועד קטן כ״ד א׳.</span></i>",
                "Every word which Rabbi Chanina had heard directly from Rabbi Jehudah, or which he heard repeated in the name of Rabbi Jehudah, he considered to be sacred and he would not deviate from it. In all questions that arose, Rabbi Chanina relied on the conduct of Rabbi Jehudah in similar cases and whenever a question arose to which Rabbi Chanina could find no answer in the Mishna, he consulted his colleagues and even his disciples. Rabbi Jochanan and Resh Lakish were thus greatly surprised when he asked their opinion in a matter which could easily be explained; but Rabbi Chanina said to them: “May evil come upon me if I ever made any statement which I have not previously heard from Rabbi Jehudah as many times as I have hair on my head. In all matters of law I would observe the conduct of Rabbi on three occasions in similar cases, but this matter concerning which I asked you I only witnessed Rabbi Jehudah observe twice. I therefore asked your opinion in order that it should be as if I had seen it observed a third time.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי נדה פרק ב׳ הלכה ז׳.</span></i>",
                "This strict adherence to tradition and the constant repetition of opinions of previous authorities was disapproved of by the other scholars of the time who did not want to allow the interpretation of the Torah to lose its vitality. Many of them therefore left Rabbi Chanina and opened academies of their own. But these differences were only theoretical and did not diminish the personal regard which they felt for each other. On the contrary, Rabbi Chanina was always glad of the honor which was bestowed upon his pupils of the past.",
                "Thus it is told that as he was once strolling in the street he saw all people abandon their work and don festive garments. He asked what the occasion for rejoicing was and he was told: “Your pupil Rabbi Jochanan has arrived and he will lecture at the academy; everybody therefore hastens to hear him.” Rabbi Chanina then pronounced the blessing of “Schehechayanu” that he had lived to see the honor accorded to his disciple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי הוריות פרק ג׳ הלכה ד׳.</span></i>",

                "His love for Palestine was indescribable. It was said that wherever he went he removed the stones and other hindrances from the way in order to smooth the road and to improve it. He was said to be able to distinguish between the soil of Palestine and soil of other lands by merely taking a lump of it in his hand. When one of his young pupils, Rabbi Simeon bar Aba, asked him whether he should go to a foreign land and requested a letter of recommendation to the scholars in Babylonia, Rabbi Chanina said to him: “I cannot give it to you, for tomorrow I may see your parents (I may die) and they may complain to me that they had owned a beautiful flower in Palestine and that I had allowed it to be transplanted to a foreign land.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי מועד קטן פרק ג׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>",

Rabbi Joshua then persuaded the man to surrender to the Romans and thus save the city.

Rabbi Simeon asked him: “Are you the son of Levi?” and Rabbi Joshua replied that he was. “Has a rainbow been seen during your lifetime?” Rabbi Simeon asked, and Rabbi Joshua answered that a rainbow was seen. “Then you are not the son of Levi,” Rabbi Simeon said, “for your merit should have protected your generation so that no rainbow should be needed.” As a matter of fact no rainbow was seen during the lifetime of Rabbi Joshua, which was the best proof of his piety, but he refused to boast of it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות ע״ז ב׳.</span></i>",

To every canopy is attached a table laden with precious stones and pearls and sixty angels stand ready to serve every saint and they say to him: ‘Eat your honey and drink your wine, for it has been prepared for you since the six days of the creation.’ Even the least of the saints equals Rabbi Jochanan in beauty and is endowed with grace like that of Joseph.”",

Its fruits have five hundred thousand tastes and each taste differs from all the others and each odor differs from all the others. Above the Tree of Life there float seven sacred clouds; breezes blow from all four sides through the leaves of the Tree of Life and its odors are wafted from one end of the world to the other.”",
                "“The saints in Paradise are subdivided into seven groups. One group consists of martyrs such as Rabbi Akiba and his colleagues and disciples; the second group consists of those who were drowned for the sanctification of the name of God such as the four hundred young men and the four hundred maidens who jumped into the sea when the enemy wished to sell them to a life of shame; the third group consists of people like Rabbi Jochanan ben Zakkai and his colleagues; the fourth group consists of people whom the enemy wanted to defame after their death and a cloud descended and covered them; the fifth group is made up of penitents; the sixth group consists of young men who never sinned, and the seventh group includes modest people who suffered humiliation without replying in kind.”"

But the Temple remained a symbol of the liberation of the people and it was always mentioned with the hope of its speedy restoration and the renewal of the service as in days of old.

It is also known that Jews began to settle in that city several decades after the destruction of the Temple.

Since the Hebrew word “Elohim” (God) is in the plural form, the Minim asked him, how many gods shared in the creation of the world. Rabbi Simlai replied that the further text amply answered their question; thus the Bible says: “Let us make man in our image” (in the plural) and this is followed by “God created man in his own image” (in the singular). When his pupils said that it was easy to give such an answer to the “Minim,” but that they were not satisfied with it, he replied that the plural was used, because Adam was created out of earth and Eve out of Adam’s rib, but in the future no increase could be had by man without woman or by woman without man, and both need the assistance of God.",

To his pupils he explained that the plural was used to indicate that God was holy with all kinds of holiness.",

Thus it was related of Rabbi Avahu that when the roof of the bath house, where he found himself at the moment, caved in, he supported it with his hands until assistance came and thus saved the lives of 101 people that were within the building from certain death.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ס׳ א׳.</span></i>",

The man was thereupon summoned and when he was asked what his trade was, he said that he was a white slave dealer.

The man told him that a woman once came to him and offered her body for a sum of money with which to redeem her husband from prison where he was incarcerated through no fault of his. The man pitied the woman and gave her all the money that he possessed and when that sum was not enough he sold his belongings to aid the woman free her husband.

Rabbi Avahu interpreted this verse to mean that “skilful as a player” indicated that David was versed in the Scriptures; “a mighty valiant man,” that he was strong in Mishna; “a man of war,” that he was skilled in the battles of the Torah; “intelligent in speech,” that he understood the value of good deeds; “a person of good form,” that he understood the Talmud. Another interpretation of Rabbi Avahu to the same verse declared that “intelligent in speech” indicated that David could deduce conclusions; “a man of good form,” that his face shone in Halacha; and “the Lord is with him,” that the law was established according to his opinion.",
                "The following is another sample of Rabbi Avahu’s method of interpretation: Of the creation of the world the Bible says that the earth “was without form, and void.” This expression was then interpreted to mean that the earth was wondering at the void which pervaded it. Rabbi Avahu compared this to a king who had bought two slaves on one contract and for the same price. The king then commanded that one of the slaves should be fed from the royal kitchen and that the other one should obtain his own food. The second slave therefore wondered: “We were both bought on one contract and for the same price and yet I must obtain my own food or starve.” The earth likewise wondered and said: “The creatures of Heaven and those of the earth were created at the same time and yet creatures of Heaven are nourished by the divine Shechinah while the creatures on earth must labor for their food else they would starve.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בראשית רבה פּרשה ב׳ פּיסקא ב׳.</span></i>",

The name of this chieftain was Barnezer Odenate. When the Romans were defeated by the Persians and their leaders were taken captive, Odenate librated them and preserved Roman rule in Syria. Emperor Galianus (264 C. E.) then recognized him as co-ruler in Syria. However, this situation did not last long for the wife of the chieftain, later queen Zenobia, hired assassins to murder her husband in order that she might rule in his stead. With her wisdom and her organizational talents she succeeded in transforming Palmyra into a metropolis. In this she was aided by the fact that the city was situated at the crossroads of important caravan routes. The city was then enlarged by the construction of beautiful palaces in the Roman style.",

Jewish historians, however, deny this and make no mention of any kind acts toward the Jews on her part. But all Roman historians concurred in their praise of her beauty, education and good taste. She was a gifted diplomat and she succeeded in persuading all the rulers of western Asia to unite against emperor Aurelius. Aurelius advanced against Zenobia with a large army when he realized that she planned to liberate her country from Roman domination. In this venture he was also successful and he devastated her land.",

Rabbi Yitzchak could not answer this question, but Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani reminded him of the rule that a scroll of the Torah from which even one parchment was missing, could not be used for reading in the Synagogue; it thus became apparent that a scroll which contained only one of the books of the Pentateuch could not be used.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין ס׳ א׳.</span></i>",

But there seems to have been a constant migration from and into Babylonia. The Roman authorities did not object to the fact that many Jews of Palestine went to Babylonia to seek a livelihood while Babylonian Jews came to Palestine to study. This was the case despite the fact that the Babylonian Jews had by that time attained a higher degree of development of learning. They then enjoyed full liberty in the observance of the religious regulations; they had their own courts and they passed sentences as they saw fit. It was only rarely that they had to consult the High Court in Palestine. The determination of the beginning of the months and of the holidays was the only thing that the Jews of Babylonia could not do. Nevertheless they considered the teachings emanating from Palestine as the only correct ones and they believed that despite the destruction of the Temple the rule that out of Zion would come learning was still sound.",

The fact that the term “death” was employed in the first and the fourth of these Rabbi Aba explained by saying that both, Babylonia and Rome, undertook to annihilate the Jews; the Babylonians destroyed the first temple and the Romans destroyed the second temple.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מדרש שוחר טוב פּרשה י״ח.</span></i>",

The scholars then added that had Rabbi Tarphon done a thousand fold for his mother, he still would not have done even half of what one is supposed to do in order to honor his parents. Later Rabbi Zeira heard it said that the mother of Rabbi Ishmael once came before the scholars to complain that her son was not according her due honor. Greatly shocked they asked the woman what Rabbi Ishmael had done that she had found it necessary to come before them to complain and the woman answered: “Every time that my son comes home from the academy I want to wash his feet and to drink the water, but he would not allow me to do so.” The scholars then said to Rabbi Ishmael: “If this is her desire, you must honor it.”",

                "On the day that Rabbi Zeira arrived in Palestine, he met a butcher who allowed himself to ridicule him, partly because of his appearance and partly because all Babylonian Jews were exposed to ridicule. Rabbi Zeira seemed to be a subject for mirth in the eyes of the butcher into whose shop he came to buy meat. When he asked the price of the meat the butcher named a sum and said that in addition to this sum the customer must be struck a blow with the hammer. Rabbi Zeira offered a higher price for the meat if he would be spared the blow, but the butcher insisted on his original statement and Rabbi Zeira finally consented.",
                "When Rabbi Zeira came to the academy that evening, he asked the meaning of this custom that every buyer of meat must receive a blow. All those present were surprised when they heard his question and they asked Rabbi Zeira where he had seen such a custom practiced. He then named the butcher and the scholars wished to send for him in order to have him punished for shaming a scholar, but they were informed that the butcher died on that same day. When they heard this, they believed that Rabbi Zeira must have cursed the butcher, but he assured them that he did not curse him and that he believed this to be the custom of the city.

The other scholars disapproved of this because even as they believed that it was a good deed to rebuke a person who might change his ways so also they considered it a sin to rebuke people who were hardened in sin. After the death of Rabbi Zeira, his wicked neighbors said: ‘Until now the short dark man prayed for us and protected us.

        "Volume III; The Amoraim of Babylon and the Babylonian Talmud": {
            "Introduction": [
                "S<small>EVEN CENTURIES PASSED</small> from the days of the first Tana until the time of the last Amora. This is a long time in the history of any people. No matter how conservative one may be, it would still be impossible to assume that all these years passed without noting profound changes in Jewish life. As was the case with other peoples, these centuries also marked the birth and development of new ideas and concepts among the Jews. Some of these vanished and gave rise to others. These centuries marked far going changes in the political position of the people. Now they were free in their own land, and then they were involved in wars; exile was succeeded by periods of peace and welfare in foreign lands.",
                "After the return from Babylonia, where they lived in an entirely strange environment, the Jews developed new ideas and concepts. The situation in Babylonia itself changed when that country came under the sway of the Persians who possessed an original culture. Later the Jews fell under the domination of the Syrian Greeks and of others. It was quite natural for the Jews to be influenced by these peoples even when they did not imitate them and when they sought to avoid the ways of the pagans. When the conquering nations tried to undermine their belief in one God they did not succeed. The Jews remained steadfast in their faith and were ready to sacrifice their lives for the observance of the Sabbath and of circumcision. The outside influence expressed itself in some modifications in the ceremonial rituals, but the fundamentals of religion were not affected.",
                "As soon as the repatriates from Babylonia were entrenched in the country—after the days of Ezra and Nehemiah—there developed a new attitude toward the Torah. They were convinced that the destruction of the Temple and the exile was a direct result of their negligence in the observance of the commandments of the Torah. They therefore determined to observe scrupulously all the regulations of the Torah. The first measure in this direction was the establishment of a rule that “many students should be maintained”. To achieve this end, many schools were established in all the comers of the land. Whereas the majority of the people had heretofore been farmers and shepherds, it was now sought to transform them into a nation of scholars. The leaders of the schools were called “Soferim”, scribes, whose duty it was to explain the Scriptures and to interpret its teachings. Later the “Soferim” were known as “Chachamim”, wise men. They thus performed a dual function of interpreting and also adapting the Torah to the needs of the time.",
                "The religious and secular life of the people was then governed by two institutions: the Great Court and the Academy, which worked hand in hand and supplemented each other. The entire content of Jewish life centered about these institutions which laid the foundation for the spiritual life of the people. The “Great Court”, later known as the “Sanhedrin”, issued all the decrees and, together with the academies, it became the law giving body which regulated the moral and religious conduct of the people and strengthened its ethical concepts. One of the first activities of the Sanhedrin was the establishment of a “protective fence” (<span dir=\"rtl\">סייג</span>) about the Torah. It was the function of this “fence” to prevent the people from doing any thing which might lead them astray from the commandments of the Torah even when the particular deed had not been prohibited in itself.",
                "Concerned with the moral conduct of the people the scholars sought to prevent any possible lapses by prohibiting men to remain alone with married women in secluded places. In addition to the forms of adultery which the Bible prohibited they also listed 26 types of relatives whom one may not marry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יבמות כ״א א׳, ירושלמי יבמות פרק ב׳ הלכה ג׳.</span></i>",
                "In the days preceding Ezra and Nehemiah the Sabbath was not strictly observed. The Soferim therefore warned the people concerning its observance and surrounded it with protective barriers. The concept of work was defined in order that people should know what may and what may not be done on the Sabbath. 39 primary occupations were listed the performance of which on the Sabbath was punishable by death. Among these were plowing, sowing, harvesting, threshing, baking, cooking, lighting and putting out fire, hunting, slaughtering animals, writing and erasing, building and destroying, sewing and tearing, carrying objects out of a house and into it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת ע״ג א׳.</span></i>",
                "In addition to these occupations the Soferim prohibited many other activities which did not constitute work in themselves but which lent a weekday atmosphere such as climbing trees, riding on animals, swimming, judging, buying and selling, marriage and others. All of these were forbidden in the interests of complete rest and were also not allowed on the holidays.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ביצה ל״ו ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Tools and vessels which were used during the performance of occupations that were forbidden on the Sabbath, could not be carried out on that day. As a further safeguard the Soferim ruled that the Sabbath was to be observed from sunset on Friday until the sunset on Saturday. Blessings to be pronounced over a glass of wine at the incoming and at the departure of the Sabbath were instituted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ל״ג א׳.</span></i> A man was likewise appointed to blow the ram’s horn as a signal to the people to cease working. The first blast signalled the field workers to cease their labors; the second one announced to the city workers to close their shops and the third one was a sign to stop all work at home. One more blast was then blown to indicate that the Sabbath had begun.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת ל״ה ב׳, קי״ד א׳, סוכה נ״ז ב׳.</span></i>",
                "The first evening of the Passover was consecrated in the same manner as the Sabbath. It partook of the nature of a family celebration and all members of the family gathered to eat of the Paschal lamb, to relate the miracles of the redemption from Egypt and to sing praises. Every Jew, even the poorest, was obliged to drink four glasses of wine on that evening.",
                "In addition to the sacrifices in the Temple, prayers were introduced at that time. It appears that prayer among Jews originated during the Babylonian captivity, when the people had no opportunity to offer sacrifices. Although the forms of the prayers were not yet defined, the idea of praying took root, but it did not supplant the offering of sacrifices which were expressly commanded in the Torah.",
                "* * *",
                "The number of Jews who returned to Palestine from the exile in Babylonia was much smaller than the number exiled. But those who remained in Babylonia were no less religious than the ones who returned. The great national struggles which characterized the return to Palestine have never been sufficiently described. We possess inadequate information concerning the time that elapsed from the coming of Ezra and Nehemiah until the rebellion of the Hasmoneans, a period of nearly two centuries. The fate of Zerubabel, who was appointed to govern the Jews of Jerusalem is also unknown.",
                "There exists a tradition, which is not substantiated by any historical evidence, that Zerubabel returned to Babylonia after he became convinced that he could achieve nothing in Palestine. Others claim that he was killed during one of the turbulent periods.",
                "It is certain, however, that a large number of Jews refused to return to Palestine even after the second temple was built and a Hasmonean ruler governed the land. These did not consider their liberation as the expected redemption. They hoped for miracles like those which accompanied the deliverance from Egypt and they awaited a wondrous Messiah from the House of David. They also disapproved of the new temple which lacked the “Urim” and “Thumim”, the Holy Ark and the Cherubim and the “sacred fire”. But the lack of authentic historical information makes it impossible to give a clear description of that time. The writings of Josephus are not entirely clear and the Talmud concerned itself more with describing the customs of the time and interpreting the verses of the Bible rather than with chronicling historical events.",
                "It is therefore impossible to determine how learning began to develop in Babylonia. But we do know that Jewish life developed in that country at the same time that it was making rapid forward strides in Palestine. When the second temple was destroyed, large numbers of Jews sought refuge in Babylonia where the Romans had no control. As often as the political circumstances allowed, there was interchange of scholars between the two countries. Thus we find Rabbi Chiya Raba sending his son, Nathan, to continue his studies in Palestine while Palestinian scholars sent their children to Babylonia. But despite this interchange, the Jews of Palestine nevertheless did not respect the Babylonian Jews. Even Babylonian scholars were ridiculed until their worth was established.",
                "Most of the Jews of Babylonia lived in Nehardea and its environs because it was closest to Palestine. Some even believed that the city was once a part of Palestine and they sought to prove that the surrounding towns were included in the conquests of Joshua. Because of this doubt, the inhabitants of Nehardea celebrated Purim for two days.",
                "The exact location of Nehardea has not been ascertained to this day. All we know is that it was located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and that the lands to the East were settled by non-Jews. Later the Babylonian Jews were compelled to wander farther inland. The persecutions in Palestine forced many scholars to settle in Babylonia and the social and economic conditions in Babylonia also contributed to the establishment of academies in different cities.",
                "Enjoying complete autonomy, the Babylonian Jews were governed by an “Exilarch” who represented them before the government. Like the Nasi in Palestine, the Exilarch also traced his descent from the house of David. At times the Exilarchs were held in even greater respect than the Nasi because they were descended from king David through the male line. At the time that Rabbi Jehudah was Nasi in Palestine, Rav Huna was Exilarch in Babylonia. Rabbi Jehudah once remarked that were Rav Huna to come to Palestine, he would accord him greater honor than he received himself.",
                "When the conditions in Palestine took a turn for the worse, Rabbi Nathan of Babylonia declared that the verse “to those who love me and observe my commandments” (Exodus, 2:6), referred to the Jews of Palestine, who were ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of the observance of the commandments and who were indifferent to death when they were caught.",
                "These conditions are best illustrated in a Talmudic story which relates that when a Jew, who was condemned to death, would be asked, “Why are you being led to execution?” he would reply, “Because I have circumcised my son.” Another would say, “Because I have studied the Torah.” One led to crucifixion would explain that he was being punished for eating Matzoth, another one that was to be flogged would explain that he incurred his punishment for holding a “Lulav”.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מכילתא דבחודש פּרשה ו׳, ילקוט יתרו רצ״ב.</span></i> Under such circumstances, the academies in Palestine were deserted. Those who wanted their sons to gain learning sent them to Babylonia. During such times the scholars of Babylonia would also determine the beginning of the months and the leap years, although this was traditionally the prerogative of the scholars of Palestine.",
                "* * *",
                "Judging by the structure of the Babylonian Talmud one might conclude that it is obscure and that its editors compiled its contents without considering sequence. But such a conclusion would be erroneous since every word was carefully weighed and measured before it was included in the Talmud. The Talmud as we have it is a wonderful structure carefully reared from its component parts. The editors of the Talmud followed the system of Rabbi Jehudah in editing the Mishna and not merely did they gather the material but they also sought to integrate it into an organic unit. Rav Ashi and Ravina, the compilers of the Babylonian Talmud, sought to link the subjects treated in the Talmud in a logical sequence. For this purpose they employed a technical terminology which served as a binding cement.",
                "After the period of the “Tanaim” the language of the Talmudic literature was not preserved in its original purity. The early Amoraim still used a language closely resembling that of the Mishna and even some of the latter ones sought to achieve this end. But the majority of their sayings were in Aramaic, which was the ordinary language of the Jews of Babylonia, interspersed with some Hebrew elements. The resulting language did not resemble the language of the Mishna.",
                "The two Talmuds, the Babylonian and the Jerusalem, differ in the language employed and also in their styles. The cause of this is that the methods of interpretation employed in the two countries differed. This is not surprising when we consider the manner in which the interchange of ideas between the two countries occurred. The constant interchange of scholars between the two lands resulted in many errors and quotations were frequently interpreted in a manner foreign to the author. Some scholars even ascribed their opinions to their predecessors in order to lend weight to their words. At other times the authors of various statements were forgotten. Considerable confusion was thus engendered in establishing the authorship of numerous decisions. At times the statements quoted were in direct contradictions to the opinions of the authors. This was especially true of the opinions ascribed to Rav (Aba Arecha). We thus find that when Rabbi Jehuda bar Ezekiel quoted Rav, his brother Rami remarked: “You should not listen to him when he speaks in the name of Rav.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות כ׳׳א א׳, חולין מ״ד א׳.</span></i> Another Amora likewise said: “Whatever Rabbi Jehudah bar Ezekiel says in the name of Rav is incorrect, for Rav had never said it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">חולין ע״ד א׳.</span></i>",
                "Even the compilers of the Talmud at times erred in this respect and they would describe a dispute between two Amoraim in contradicting versions on different occasions.

                "One should not assume that the Talmud is a unified work. The teachings of seven centuries do not readily fuse into a unit. This is particularly true since so many different men of differing tastes shared in its creation. But the Talmud does possess a homogeneous character and it constitutes an integrated work.",
                "In the prefaces to our first two volumes we sought to acquaint the reader with the ideas of the scholars concerning the various problems of life. We shall now supplement those remarks in order to provide a complete picture of their mode of thought. The ideas of our scholars concerning God were original and differed from those accepted among the surrounding peoples. Greek culture which was then highly developed still clung to polytheism. The same was true of the Romans, the Parthians and the Persians. One therefore marvels at the endurance of the scholars and at their success in resisting all attempts to introduce polytheism.",

Chiya came with his children and they revived it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סוכה ב׳ א׳.</span></i>",
                "This R. Chiya was Rav’s uncle, as we have already said, and when he went to Palestine he took along with him his two sons, Hezekiah and Judah, his brother’s son Rabah bar Chana, his colleagues R. Chanina bar Chama, R. Simlai, and our Rav. It seems that all these scholars were descendants of ancestors who fled from Palestine during the persecutions of Hadrian or perhaps during later persecutions. They all kept together in Babylonia and together they returned to Palestine.",
                "At that time everybody felt the need to continue the systematization of the Jewish faith through the principles of the “Mishnah” and Rav, of course, took part actively in this work. His thoughts were concerned with the effort to understand Jewish life clearly. The wish arose in him to lend a hand to the new systematization of the Jewish faith. The frenzied turmoil of events stirred Rav’s soul to constant anxiety about the Jewish position. His whole life circled in a long chain between desperation and hope. His only desire was to see his people secure in its national existence.",
                "One may see this aim in every act of his life, even while he was still a student in the synagogue and his abilities were just beginning to reveal their splendor—especially in his questions to the teachers under whom he studied. One may see the same thing in his later life when he began to think independently and all the older scholars under whom he had studied were dead.",
                "He came to Palestine with his uncle R. Chiya and several other scholars from Babylonia. It was said then that the purpose of their coming was to aid in the people’s development. In this common aim each one had his own method: one wished to restore the spiritual soundness of the masses, another was concerned about the political situation, still another was busy protecting Jews from pagans and another one tried to set an example by his own good deeds.",
                "The arrival of those scholars in Palestine was a great blessing for the people, especially the coming of R. Chiya. Palestine profited doubly by his presence, economically and culturally, for in addition to his activity as a teacher he was also active in commerce. He bought land and had it cultivated at his own expense or rented it out to tenants. Then he exported many divers goods from Palestine and sold them in foreign lands. He employed many people, both relatives and strangers. He had connections in the most distant countries, and a lively trade developed between Palestine and the neighboring countries. This made a living for those who helped him and also stimulated others to follow in his foot-steps.",
                "R. Chiya’s chief item of trade was flax. It is related that once he did not wish to sell his flax for the prevailing price because he hoped for a better price later. The merchants offered his flax at the price of next Purim when flax was usually at its dearest. R. Chiya asked R. Jehudah Hanasi whether such a transaction was permissible. R. Jehudah Hanasi said that such a profit could be called “usury” and was therefore illegal. Later, therefore, R. Chiya declared that such a transaction was a transgression against the Jewish law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי בבא מציעא פרק ח׳ הלכה ו׳.</span></i>",
                "When R. Chiya and his friends came to Palestine they did not settle in Sephoris, where R. Jehudah Hanasi had the seat of his power but they went to live in Tiberias. It is supposed therefore that R. Chiya’s arrival in Palestine and his activity there was not entirely pleasing to the Nasi. He did not wish another spiritual power to grow up in Palestine beside his school in Sephoris, headed by a person who reckoned his descent from king David.",
                "Other historians, however, see no significance in the fact that R. Chiya settled in Tiberias instead of Sephoris near the “Nasi.” They say there were no ulterior motives for this act, but that the Babylonians who were accustomed to a warmer climate could not stand the atmosphere of Sephoris. They believed that most people die of colds in Sephoris.",
                "People in Palestine used to say, also, that since the arrival of R. Chiya with his sons and students, the hurricanes and earthquakes ceased, the wine had stopped turning sour, and the flax had not spoiled.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">חולין פּ״ו א׳.</span></i>",
                "While Rav was in Tiberias with his uncle he spent a great deal of time with the students of R. Meir, R. Shimeon ben Eleazar, R. Shimeon ben Chalafta, and Symachos, from whom he acquired several of R. Meir’s sayings, which he repeated in R. Meir’s name as though he had heard them directly from R. Meir.",
                "Thus Rav always used to say: “A man must accustom himself to think that whatever the Almighty does is done for the best,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ס׳ ב׳.</span></i> or that “One should always try to teach students as briefly as possible.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים ג׳ ב׳.</span></i> On other occasions he would say that “one should always leave the house when the streets are light.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים ב׳ א׳.</span></i>",
                "The sayings which Rav learned from R. Meir’s students and which he quoted in the name of R. Meir were usually such as dealt with human conduct and the aims of life. Rav loved life and did not regard it as a passing phase of universal existence.",
                "After R. Chiya had settled in Tiberias he often took Rav with him to visit R. Jehudah Hanasi in Sephoris. The trip from Tiberias to Sephoris and back took a certain amount of time, besides which they would stop frequently during the trip because someone wished to be enlightened on some subject about which the Nasi could not be consulted at that particular time. In this way a sort of travelling religious center was established, which often changed the scene of activity. When R. Jehudah Hanasi died R. Chiya considered himself a more competent religious authority than the later “Nasi” Rabban Gamliel (the son of R. Jehudah Hanasi) or his brother R. Shimeon. He was hurt therefore that he was not chosen for some position of national leadership.",
                "The arrival of R. Chiya and his family and students in Palestine was an event of great importance, because besides the effect of their teaching they brought new life to the crushed spirits of the Palestinians, who had almost given up all hope of a free life. Since the Babylonians were in a better position at that time than the Palestinians, R. Chiya’s group did not have bent backs, and their free manners influenced the Jews of Palestine.",
                "The Palestinians saw a revival of the Torah in the coming of R. Chiya. At the same time the social life of the scholarly groups was revived, they began to visit each other and meet in conference.",
                "During his trips with R. Chiya, Rav satisfied his interest in king David, and in tracing all the places where he hid from Saul and where he waged war on the Philistines, Rav acquired a precise knowledge of Palestinian geography as well as of the differences in the situation of the Jews and their customs in different places.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירזשלמי כתובות פרק ט׳ הלכה ט׳.</span></i>",

                "It is probable that Rav stayed in Palestine no more than five or six years the first time that he came there with his uncle, R. Chiya, and his students. Then he returned to Babylonia for a short time. It seems that this voyage to Babylonia had no influence upon the later course of his life or upon the history of the Jews.",
                "The reason for his return to Babylonia, it seems, was his desire to be married. Although it is not expressly stated, one can infer it from his leave-taking from R. Chiya. R. Chiya said to him in farewell, when he left his uncle to return to Babylonia, “May the Almighty protect you from a fate worse than death!” Later Rav wondered what could be worse than death, until he remembered the verse in Ecclesiastes (VII, 26) which states that “Woman is more bitter than death.” One may infer therefore that his uncle wished to warn him to be very careful in picking his wife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יבמות ס״ג א׳.</span></i>",
                "When Rav was about to leave Palestine, R. Chiya said to R. Jehudah Hanasi: “My sister’s son is going to Babylonia, may he teach there?” The Nasi answered, “He may.” Then R. Chiya asked, “May he give judgment?” The Nasi answered, “He may.” Then R. Chiya asked whether he might give judgment concerning the first-born of clean cattle and the answer was, “That he may not do.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין ה׳ א׳.</span></i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The question concerning the first-born of pure cattle was this: After the Temple was destroyed Jews could not slaughter the first-born of pure cattle unless it had suffered some injury. The extent of such an injury necessary to enable it to be slaughtered had to be certified by a court. R. Jehudah Hanasi permitted Rav to give judgment on all sorts of matters except in this case.</i>",
                "For almost the whole period that Rav remained in Babylonia the first time he returned, he stayed in the city of Nehardea where he continued his studies. He used to correspond with R.

                "A short time later, when Rav had returned from Babylonia, R. Jehudah Hanasi died. This occurred around 190 C.E. Not long afterwards R. Chiya, Rav’s uncle, also died. After R. Jehudah Hanasi’s death his son Rabban Gamliel took his place and occupied the position of Nasi about ten years. Rav continued to sit in the Nasi’s school as a student. He later quoted a great deal of what he had learned from Rabban Gamliel. Only after Rabban Gamliel died and R. Jehudah N’siah the First was chosen to take his father’s place, did Rav feel that he no longer wished to remain in Palestine and he returned to Babylonia, where he remained until the end of his life.",
                "The deteriorating political situation of the Jews in Palestine had a great influence upon Rav’s final decision to return to Babylonia permanently. Because of the political situation, R. Chiya once said that the Almighty knew the Jews would not be able to stand the persecutions of Edom, that is of the Romans, and therefore he dispersed them into Babylonia where they could live in better political circumstances.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים פּ״ז ב׳.</span></i>",
                "We may infer from this statement that if R. Chiya had not felt too old and weak to go to Babylonia, he might also have left Palestine. Still the difficult political situation was not the only reason why Rav returned to Babylonia. We may assume that a great part in his decision was due to the fact that R. Jehudah N’siah did not grant him any particular position in his school; for patiently as Rav may have suffered his low position up to now, he surely did not wish to stand it any longer and therefore went away from Palestine.",
                "It should be mentioned also that when Rav returned from Babylonia, R. Jehudah again allowed him to grant releases from vows and give judgment in cases of feminine cleanliness. When R. Jehudah Hanasi died, Rav asked his successor, Rabban Gamliel, to allow him to grant permission about the use of first-born cattle.

During the discussion sparks used to fly from Rav’s mouth to R. Jehudah Hanasi’s mouth and from R. Jehudah Hanasi’s mouth to Rav’s mouth, and R.

                "The time when Rav returned to Babylonia was a period in which the mutual influence of the scholars was at its greatest height. And at the same time there was great friction and sharp differences of opinion between them. Even then there were several different spiritual centers and academies. Besides the academy of the Nasi in Sephoris, there were academies in Tiberias and Caesarea. R. Jehudah Hanasi attempted to concentrate all religious authority in his own hands, and since there were many scholars who rivalled the Nasi in learning, he was very sparing in granting “ordinations” and such scholars as Levi ben Sisi, Samuel of Nehardea, as well as Hezekiah and Judah the two sons of R. Chiya were not “ordained” and never entitled to be called “Rabbi”.",
                "In the meantime things went from bad to worse politically. After the death of the Emperor Commodus (192 C. E.) Pescenius Niger tried to seize power in Rome. He was defeated in open warfare by Septimus Severus. It is hard to know today with whom the Jews sided in the warfare just as it is not known whether either of the rivals promised certain national concessions in the event of his victory.",
                "Judging by the circumstances and the documents of that war which have remained, we may say that the Jews did not even dream of national liberation. They felt in an instinctive manner, however, that they ought to take the opposite side in this war from the side taken by the heathen inhabitants of Palestine (Romans, Greeks, and Syrians), who supported Pescenius Niger. The Samaritans of Shechem did the same—and there is only a hint in a saying of Rav as to the side which the Jews took, when he said: “I am for Sufianus.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ירושלמי ברכות פרק ט׳ הלכה א׳.</span></i>",
                "At the same time severe fighting broke out between the Jews and the Samaritans in which a great deal of blood was shed. When Septimus Severus won and became the Emperor of Rome, the followers of Pescenius Niger were severely punished. In the year 200 when Septimus Severus returned from the field after having laid waste the Parthian lands, he passed through Palestine and issued repressive laws against the Gentiles and Samaritans.",

                "Still Palestine continued to be the scene of wars and slaughters. A certain Claudius of whom nothing is known except that the Romans called him “ladro”, which means “bandit”, became the leader of guerrillas who operated in Syria and Palestine. From their lairs in the hills of Judah they would swoop down upon passers-by or upon neighboring cities and rob and murder at will.",
                "And since many Jews were found among these guerrillas for some reason or other, the Roman government demanded that R. Eleazar ben R. Shimeon ben Yochai and R. Ishmael the son of R. Jose ben Chalafta help them discover the Jewish bandits in their caves and turn them over to the government.",

But the following passages are simply meaningless in the context. Since the whole quotation comes to us at third hand, and the hand of the censor also did its share of damage, we may state with assurance that the end is an apocryphal addition, and God knows who its author is.</i>",

He felt that it was his duty only to regulate weights and measures, not the price or the quality of the goods, and he felt that if a buyer let himself be deceived concerning the price or the quality of his wares, nobody had a right to interfere, for these were matters which concerned only the individual buyer and not the general welfare.

The academy in Sura had a loftier title than the one at Nehardea, being called not “Sidra” but “Mesivta”, even though the area of Sura was sparsely inhabited and served as a home for a pack of suspicious characters, most of whom were robbers and thieves.

                "As we have said, Rav could not or did not wish to remain in Nehardea and he chose Sura for the center of his future work. Since then Sura was called “Rav’s place” and just as Babylonia itself was divided geographically into the upper hilly region and a lower region of valleys, the leadership of the Jews was divided between Sura and Nehardea.",
                "The center in Sura quickly became the more important and most of the communities in the country accepted Rav’s theories and regulated their lives according to them. The Nehardean scholars often tried to put their ideas over but without success.",
                "Rav did not remain content with merely the work in his academy. He travelled from city to city throughout Babylonia trying to establish his policies. His students after him did the same, settling in over twenty cities, and in spite of opposition they succeeded in propagating Rav’s religious views. By the revolutionary struggle and the wanderings of these people over the broad prairies and sandy wastes of Babylonia the region of Sura became thickly populated with Jews. Over night Jewish settlements sprang up there.",
                "Together with the Jews a cosmopolitan mass of different peoples also came, and drove the earlier inhabitants, the “Parthians” out and settled in their place. In many parts of Babylonia Jewish tribes declared themselves politically independent and set up rulers out of their midst. Elsewhere the Heathen persecuted the Jews and the Jews bent their backs under the yoke of oppression. Frequently the Jews sowed the fields and cultivated them, only to see other peoples come and take over the fields with the aid of a new government. A new law based on the right of power developed and whoever seized a field was its lawful owner until someone stronger came and seized it for himself.",
                "When Rav came to Babylonia, king Artaban, a friend of his, ruled there. After the death of this king, Babylonia was captured by a foreign tribe named the “Sassanides” who set up their own king, Ardjir Babegan, upon the throne. Under his rule the condition of the Jews quickly deteriorated. Power was in the hands of the old Aramites, who regarded themselves as descended from the ancient Babylonians who destroyed the first Temple and drove the Jews out of Palestine.",
                "There was a strong hatred between the Jews and the Aramites, and most of the “Anti-Gentile” passages in the Talmud were directed against them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It should be noted that most of the censors who supervised the printing of the Talmud did a great deal of destruction in erasing the word “Arami” (Aramite), and substituting <span dir=\"rtl\">עכו״ם</span> (idolator) as one may see in the texts printed by R. N. Rabinowitz in his book “Dikdukei Sofrim” for which he used a Talmud manuscript of the year 1502.</i> Jews ordinarily regarded them as murderers and highway-robbers. Jews did not even trust their doctors, as Rav said: “Whoever wishes to become blind, may have his eyes treated by an Aramite doctor.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">נדה ל״ה ב׳, ירושלמי עבודה זרה פרק ב׳ הלכה ב׳.</span></i>",
                "At the same time there was a tendency among those peoples to be converted to Judaism, in order to enjoy the rights of a <span dir=\"rtl\">״גר״</span> (proselyte) among Jews. Rav, as well as the other scholars of that time, protested sharply against the acceptance of proselytes for fear of mixture of races.",
                "In addition to his fear of racial mixture Rav was also afraid of the confusion of cultures. He continually issued warnings against those who followed the ways of the “Magics” (<span dir=\"rtl\">אמגושיים</span>) who occupied themselves with star-gazing and grave-robbing for magical purposes. They believed, also, that the dead continue to live in another world, get married and eat just as though they were alive. In addition to the Magics, Rav cautioned the people against imitating the <span dir=\"rtl\">״חברים״</span> that is the Persians who later overran the whole of Babylonia.",
                "Because of the change in the political situation in Babylonia, from which the Jews suffered severely, Rav was often afflicted with a feeling of desperation.

                "It should be remarked also that when Rav arrived in Babylonia, the moral condition of the people in Nehardea and its vicinity was very low. Living mainly in the cities where luxury was rife, the people were much given to sin. A legend relates that one of the “Amoraim” once met the Prophet Elijah and asked why he delayed his coming.

It was only because they were mostly shepherds and farmers that they were not as dissolute as the Nehardeans. Rav expended much effort in teaching morals, especially regarding sexual relations. When speaking on this subject Rav always clothed his remarks in real-life allegories; he threatened the sinners with God’s severest punishment saying that it was precisely because of crimes of this sort that Jerusalem was destroyed.",
                "Religion as well as morality stood at a low level in Sura. Rav instituted a number of regulations designed to strengthen religious feeling.

                "After Rav came to Sura the city was rebuilt in a beautiful style. Rav made a regulation that the synagogue should be the highest structure in the city. R.

                "By studying Rav’s teachings one soon learns that he had an individual system. A great difficulty in reconstructing this system is the fact that most of Rav’s utterances are not handed down directly from himself but only in the form in which his students have quoted them. The only conclusion which can safely be drawn from all the material we possess concerning Rav, is the conclusion that when Rav issued judgment upon any legal problem, he tried first of all to understand the spirit of the legal rule which could be applied to that problem. This method is particularly clear in cases where he tried to discover the author of a certain anonymous “Mishnah”. He would ask “From what Tanna does this Mishnah derive?” and in his further analysis of the problem, Rav showed himself to be the greatest of all the previous scholars.",
                "He knew that there were certain definite rules in the system of the Mishnah which defined the stand which any Tanna would take on a given problem. Knowing the rule defining a Tanna’s bias from the Mishnah’s in which his name was mentioned, Rav could easily discover the author of any anonymous “Mishnah” which bore the unmistakable stamp of the same tendency. In the discussion of the law concerning the “vermin and reptiles” which were forbidden food for a Jew, it is stated that if a Jew caught or wounded one on the Sabbath, providing this catching or wounding was not necessary for his own use, he was innocent of a sin. Rav then asked: “On the basis of whose legal opinions has this law been constructed? — for this was an anonymous Misnah. And he answered that the Mishnah agreed with the opinion of R. Shimeon (ben Yochai) who stated, “Some work which is not necessarily for one’s personal needs, is not considered a sin when it is done on the Sabbath.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת ק״ז ב׳.</span></i>",
                "This method of seeking out the author of all anonymous Mishnahs remained the system of the academy in Sura until it went out of existence. In Nehardea, on the other hand, there was never any interest in the authorship of any Mishnah. For them it was the law itself which was important without regard to its origin and authorship.",
                "Rav also had a fine style both in Hebrew and in Aramaic. Everything he said seemed to be carved out of a single piece. Even today it is an aesthetic delight to study any of Rav’s utterances, whether the contents are of interest or not.",
                "Concerning the scope of the term “sacrilege” Rav declared that a man like himself would be guilty of that transgression “if he bought some meat from a butcher and did not pay immediately,” because the butcher might think that Rav had simply robbed him of the meat, and that might lead him to think lightly of the crime of robbery himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">יומא פּ״ג א׳.</span></i>",

Samuel bar Shilet to illustrate the meaning of the word “idler,” because it is believed that this R. Samuel bar Shilet was neither a rich man nor an idler, but a teacher of children who lived on what his pupils paid him. Rav probably meant that a man like R. Samuel bar Shilet had all his needs provided for him in his house and did not need to work in the fields to get his food, as the other scholars in Babylonia had to do, and therefore he could sleep quietly in his bed as though it were a palace and the tax collector knew him not.</i> who eats of his own and drinks of his own and sleeps like a prince in a palace and the tax collector never comes to his door.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">90)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות ס״ב א׳.</span></i>",

It is said that he flogged anyone who married a woman simply through intercourse, or when a man met a woman in the street and married her without a prior agreement about the wedding contract.

In Rav Nachman’s time, however, there was an increase in the number of daring swindlers who denied their debts and could not be forced to back up their denials with an oath. Rav Nachman ordained a so called <span dir=\"rtl\">״שבועת היסת״</span> which was an oath administered in cases where the claimant had no witnesses to substantiate his claim of debt and the accused denied the debt completely.

It should be remarked also that in spite of his strict principles he often tried to moderate the severity of religious custom: for instance, he said that bricks or other building materials which had been left after a building was completed might be removed on the Sabbath because they were in the same category as vessels and utensils, no longer being considered as building materials.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ביצה ל״א ב׳.</span></i>",

Similarly there could be not talk of claims of possession against the Exilarch’s property, because his servants used to let strangers live in their houses and cultivate their fields and said nothing, because they did not care if other people took care of the Exilarch’s houses or fertilized his fields, since they knew that they could take everything back by force whenever they wanted to do so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא בתרא ל״ו א׳.</span></i>",

And if a person makes a custom of praying behind the synagogue such a man should be called an evil-doer. One should be very careful to say the vesper prayers for the prophet Elijah was aided by God in his battle against the prophets of Baal during the time of vespers. One should know also that the words of the God-fearing are heard in Heaven. On another occasion Rav Helbo said in the name of Rav Huna that “one who knows that his friend is accustomed to greet him should greet him first.

From this we may infer that he probably studied under Rav, although there is no mention of any personal encounter between Rav Chisda and Rav or Shmuel; for during Rav’s life Rav Chisda apparently sat modestly in a corner of his school and listened to his words with pious attention.

He was a man of forty at the time. In the meantime he had studied under a number of other pupils of Rav’s, and people were beginning to pay attention to his opinions. Still it is characteristic that in all the time that Rav Chisda sat under Rav Huna as a student he was very careful never to say anything that might appear to be a statement of a law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין ס״ב ב׳.</span></i> And when someone once came to consult him on a question of law he immediately referred him to Rav Huna.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא מציעא ז׳ א׳.</span></i> Only one exception is recorded: when the “Exilarch” asked Rav Huna what was the basis of the law which forbade bride and groom to wear crowns on their heads at a wedding. Rav Huna answered: “This was an enactment of the Rabbis who relate that in the time of the war against Emperor Vespasian it was forbidden to wear bridegroom’s crowns and to celebrate engagement parties.” After this statement Rav Huna left the school. Then Rav Chisda said: “It is not only an enactment of the Rabbis, but there is also a Bible text for it: ‘Remove the mitre and take off the crown.’ (Ezekiel, 21, 31). It is natural to ask what is the relation between the mitre and the crown? The following exegesis solves this problem: the verse means that so long as the mitre remains on the head of the High Priest, others may wear the crown, but when the mitre was removed from the head of the High Priest, the crown upon the heads of others had to fall also!”",
                "In the meantime Rav Huna had returned and hearing Rav Chisda’s interpretation he was not angry because Rav Chisda had allowed himself to express an opinion in opposition to his teacher, but he said: “I swear to God that the prohibition of which we spoke is an enactment of the Rabbis.

He found his opportunity when the two of them had an argument about the respect which one is obliged to pay one’s teacher. Rav Chisda asked how the case stood with a student whose teacher needed him in order to sharpen his mind by answering his acute questions. Rav Huna understood that Rav Chisda meant himself by the reference and intended to cast a reflection upon Rav Huna. He replied; “Chisda, Chisda, know that I need you not at all, but you do need me.” Afterwards they parted from each other for forty long years.

                "Rav Chisda was very keen in the interpretation of law and he was also very clever in reading new meanings into things by skillful analogies. We shall cite two examples of his way of thinking: In explaining the reason why a man is allowed to go two thousand ells away from his place on the Sabbath even though the Bible says, “Let no man leave his place on the seventh day” (Exodus, 17, 29) Rav Chisda said that in as much as the expression “place” was also used in the verse “and I shall set up a place for you” (Exodus, 21, 13) in the case of an accidental homicide the two passages were parallel and the word “place” (<span dir=\"rtl\">מקום</span>) should be understood to mean a city. Later the word “he will flee” is used concerning an accidental homicide, so that we must understand the word “place” used concerning the Sabbath to refer also to flight. The problem arises how far one may flee. There is another verse “the boundary of his city of refuge that he flees” (Numbers, 38, 26) so that we must interpret the verse “let no man leave his place” as if it used the word “boundary”. The meaning of the word boundary must be inferred from its meaning in its use in the verse which uses the expression outside “and their measures are two thousand ells outside the city” (Numbers, 35, 5). We find therefore that the measure of a “Sabbath pale” from which a man is allowed to flee is the boundary of “two thousand ells”.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין נ״א א׳.</span></i>",
                "Rav Chisda performed a similar feat of interpretation in connection with the law of “searching out leaven”. How do we know that leavened bread must be searched out before Passover with a candle? In dealing with the matter the Bible says “rye shall not be found for seven days” (Exodus, 12, 19) and since in the story of Joseph’s cup the Bible says “and he searched and he found” (Genesis, 44, 12) it is clear that in order to find one must search, and there is a Biblical verse concerning searching which states “I will search Jerusalem with candles” (Zephaniah, 1, 12) so that we know that in order to search to find, one must use candles. And if we wish to know how many candles to use there is a verse which states “The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord searching all the inward parts of the belly” (Proverbs, 20, 27). From this we may infer that if one searches in order to find, one should search with one candle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>",
                "After Rav Chisda left Rav Huna’s academy they had frequent differences of opinion over matters of law in which each one directly contradicted the other, as for instance in the question of how pure a place must be in order that <span dir=\"rtl\">״קריאת שמע״</span> may be said there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות כ״ח א׳.</span></i> or whether one may make a hole in a barrel on the Sabbath in order to put in a tap,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת קמ״ז א׳.</span></i> or concerning the problem that all foods have to be salted and whether a dish kept overnight had to have spices.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ביצה י״ד א׳.</span></i> On another occasion they differed concerning an important problem of life: a man had given his agent a divorce for his wife and the agent had faithfully carried out his mission and delivered the divorce. Later the man regretted his action and claimd that he had simply given the divorce papers to his messenger for safe-keeping. The messenger, on the other hand, claimed that he had received the papers for delivery to the wife. Rav Huna said the man was to be believed and the divorce did not stand.

This displeased Rav Judah and he said that “anyone who lives in Babylon is as though he lived in Palestine.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות קי״א א׳.</span></i> And if a Babylonian still wanted to go to Palestine it was no less than a sin as the Almighty warned us through the prophet Jeremiah, “To Babylon they shall come and there they shall be.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות כ״ב ב׳, שבת מ״א א׳.</span></i> For many scholars however their love for Palestine was a stronger force than their teacher’s opposition and they said nothing to him about leaving the country because they knew he would not permit them to leave.

                "As we said the purity of the family was the most important element in the whole national existence of the Jewish people, according to Rav Judah. And since he was always examining into the purity of various families he found it difficult to get a suitable wife for his son Isaac, who had long been of marriageable age, until Ula, on one of his numberless trips between Babylon and Palestine, arrived in Pumbeditha and heard of Rav Judah’s habit of inquiring into the history of various families. Said he: “How do we know what our own origin is? Perhaps we too are descendants of those pagans which slipped into the fold during the time when the Temple was destroyed?” Because of Rav Judah’s agitation about the problem of purity of families, a number of betrothals were broken off in Jewish homes and there were even a number of divorces. The people grew angry at Rav Judah and a mob once got together in order to stone him. He was not the least bit frightened by the mob and he said: “If they annoyed him, he would reveal that they all came from impure families.” The crowd was frightened and they all threw away their stones and did not trouble Rav Judah any longer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">קדושין ע׳ א׳ וב׳.</span></i>",

This person was a freedman who had managed to win the esteem of king Sapor. In consequence the whole world toadied to him and tried to find favor in his eyes. Only Rav Judah had the courage to say that since the freedman in his pride had not asked his former owner for a certificate of liberation, he was still legally a slave and no free man could marry his children.",
                "As we have already related, a certain person from Nehardea once came to Pumbeditha and went to a butcher to buy meat, just at the time when one of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel’s servants came there. The butcher said to him: “You will have to wait awhile until I give meat to Rav Judah bar Ezekiel’s servant.” The man made a grimace and asked: “Who is this Rav Judah bar Sheveskal, that I must wait for him?” The story was repeated to Rav Judah and he was highly annoyed. And since he was told in addition that the man boasted of an ancestry which reached back to the Hasmoneans and was accustomed to call everyone “slave”, Rav Judah excommunicated him according to Samuel Yarchinai’s long-established rule that “anyone who boasts of his descent from the Hasmoneans is certainly a slave,” because king Herod killed off all the Hasmoneans without exception. The condemned man complained to Rav Nachman bar Jacob about Rav Judah. Rav Nachman did not hesitate a moment but sent Rav Judah a summons to appear before him and explain his actions. Rav Judah would not have heeded Rav Nachman’s summons and would not have appeared for trial. But he went to Rav Huna first to ask his advice. Rav Huna said that by right he should not have to go, because his learning was greater than that of Rav Nachman. But seeing that the latter was the son-in-law of the Exilarch, he should do him the honor of obeying his summons.",
                "When Rav Judah arrived at Rav Nachman bar Jacob’s house he found him making a balcony for his roof, and Rav Judah said: “How comes it that you are doing work unsuited to your social status, which ought to be done by someone else?” And no matter what Rav Nachman had to answer him in the argument which followed, Rav Judah would correct the grammar of each sentence or prove to him that he was wrong as to the law.

A story was told of one of Rav Judah’s students, Rami bar Dikola, who once arrived in Pumbeditha from Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur and saw them discarding the udders of their cows: for in Sura they did not eat the flesh of the udders, fearing that a lick of milk might still have remained there, while in Pumbeditha they did eat it after having slit it in two directions. This Rami bar Dikola gathered the discarded udders and ate them. He was brought before Rav Chisda to explain his actions. Rav Chisda asked him what had brought him to eat the udders of cows, knowing as he did that this was not in accordance with the custom of Sura. “I come from the city where Rav Judah is the head of the academy and there it is our custom to eat the udders of cows.” “You know the rule,” said Rav Chisda, “that a stranger who comes to a city in which there is a different religious custom from that of his own town should always follow the stricter practice of the two, and therefore you should not have eaten the udders.” To this Rami answered: “I ate the udders outside the city limits.” “And how did you roast them?” asked Rav Chisda. “With grape twigs,” replied Rami. “So, and what if they were the twigs of impure vines?” said Rav Chisda. Rami replied, “The twigs were more than twelve months old and all dry so that the law of impure vines does not apply to them.”",
                "Later on they noticed that the man did not put on his phylacteries. When asked what was the reason for this, he replied: “I have stomach trouble and Rav Judah has ruled that anyone with stomach trouble is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries.” Later on they noticed that that man did not wear the ritual fringes on his garments. When he was asked the reason for this, he answered: “My garment is borrowed and Rav Judah has ruled that a borrowed garment need not be worn with ritual fringes.”",
                "During this conversation Rami noticed that they were bringing in a man to be flogged for disrespect to his parents. When they had bound the man to a post, he said: “Let him go. Wherever the Bible promises a reward for observing a certain commandment, as in the case of the commandment to respect one’s father and mother, where the Bible promises long life for the observance of the law, the punishment for non-observance should be left to God and the courts of man should not deal with such cases.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">חולין ק״י א׳ וב׳.</span></i>",

Many of them even used the excuse that they were suddenly seized by a desire to go to Palestine. In truth however we may assume that the sophistry of Pumbeditha was a very important factor in their decision to leave. It may be assumed also that Rav Judah’s method of study was well known in Palestine also, and nobody granted it recognition.

But he was very poor and in addition a very modest man and did not wish to accept. Since the “Heads of the Academy” in Sura were mostly wealthy men, Rabah thought that Pumbeditha should have the same distinction. So 400 scholars, apparently at the suggestion of Rabah himself went to Rav Huna bar Chiya<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*)</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Not to be confused with Rav Huna the head of the academy in Sura or Rav Huna Raba the contemporary of Rabbi Judah Hanasi.</i>. and crowned him head of the academy in Pumbeditha.",
                "However, it became known immediately that Rav Huna bar Chiya made his fortune as a tax-collector over the Babylonian Jews for the Persian king. This occupation was considered highly dishonorable at the time and it was a widely accepted opinion that a Jewish tax-collector who served a pagan king lost his share in Heaven. The scholars therefore sent a special delegation to Rav Huna bar Chiya saying: “Choose one of the two posts, either be head of the academy or tax-collector, for you cannot hold both these posts simultaneously.” Rav Huna bar Chiya immediately resigned his post as tax-collector. But many scholars did not content themselves with the fact that Rav Huna bar Chiya had given up his position as tax-collector, for they felt that once a man had held that position he no longer deserved the respect of the Jews.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בכורות ל״א א׳.</span></i>",
                "And in fact the prestige and the honor of the academy in Pumbeditha suffered at that time and when Rav Huna died they had to pick a man for his position who could restore the good name of the Pumbeditha academy by his great learning and his personal virtues. There were only two suitable candidates for this post, Rabah bar Nachmani and Rav Joseph bar Chiya.",
                "Both were famous scholars, the greatest in their time. During the period when Rav Huna bar Chiya was head of the academy in Pumbeditha, Rabah bar Nachmani continued to grow in importance and he was called the “uprooter of mountains,” meaning that he could pull up mountains and grind them to powder by the sheer force of his argumentation. Since they believed that Rabah bar Nachmani would not accept the position, they had to have a second candidate. This was Rav Joseph bar Chiya who was called “Sinai”, because all the laws of the Torah were so systematically arranged in his head that it seemed as though he had really heard them directly from the mouth of God on Mount Sinai. The Babylonian scholars did not know what to do. They sent to Palestine for advice. The Palestinians replied that since “Sinai” is more important than an “uprooter of hills”, they should choose the “Sinai”. But Rav Joseph bar Chiya did not wish to accept the position because an astrologer once told him that if he became the head of an academy he would not live to officiate any longer than two years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ס״ד א׳, הוריות י״ד א׳.</span></i> Immediately on receiving this news the scholars forced Rabah bar Nachmani to accept the position. He had immediate success in raising the prestige of the academy in Pumbeditha, where twelve thousand people and sometimes more would gather in the school-months of Adar and Elul.",

                "According to the Talmud, Rabah bar Nachmani came from a town called Mimla (Mimalis) in Babylonia, the majority of whose inhabitants were priests and, as they then believed, all of them were descendents of the family of the High Priest Eli, upon whom there rested a curse that all the males of his family would die early. Thus every traveller who visited Mimla would wonder at the absence of elderly people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בראשית רבה פּרשה נ״ט פּיסקא א׳.</span></i> It is related also that Rabah bar Nachmani had three brothers whose names were Chailil, Rav Chanina and Rav Oshaya, all three of whom were extremely poor. Rav Chanina and Rav Oshaya went to Palestine where they made a living making shoes. And since they avoided sin very carefully they were known as “the holy Rabbis of the land of Israel.” Their virtue expressed itself in the fact that although they sat in the market of the prostitutes and sewed their shoes and the prostitutes cast lecherous eyes upon them, they did not pay heed to these glances.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים ק״י ב׳.</span></i>",
                "From early youth Rabah bar Nachmani excelled in acumen. Like many other Babylonian scholars he went to Palestine as a young man to study, and when he returned to Babylon to study with Rav Nachman bar Jacob and with Rav Huna and Rav Chisda, his brothers would continually pound it into his head to go back to Palestine and study there. He obeyed them and returned to Palestine for a short time. However his keen mind found no satisfaction in the simplicity characteristic of learning in Palestine and he returned again to Babylon.",
                "As we have noted Rabah was very poor and in addition he was an ailing person. People used to remark the injustice of fate, saying that Rabah was as great a saint as Rav Chisda had been, and yet Rav Chisda lived to the age of ninety-two and Rabah lived only to the age of forty. Rav Chisda lived to see sixty marriages among his children and grandchildren and Rabah’s household suffered from sixty kinds of ailment. Rav Chisda’s deer disdained to eat the finest wheat and the people of Rabah’s house sought a bit of oaten meal and could not find it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>",
                "As head of the academy it was Rabah’s effort to try to popularize what he had heard from his teachers. In addition he specialized in the laws of ritual purity and tried to make them intelligible to his students; though he found few auditors for this subject, because people were interested in studying the laws which were still in force and not the laws of the Messianic era.

When he was teaching his students he had a custom of starting with a <i>\"bon mot\"</i> to capture the attention of the students.",
                "For all these reasons the scholars held Rabah bar Nachmani in high honor, both because of his clear grasp of the Torah and his own virtues. Still, since he was a man of truth and very strict in the observance of the laws, and respected no sinner but punished them severely for their transgressions, the mob in Pumbeditha hated him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת קנ״ג א׳.</span></i> Once when there was no rain, Rabah ordered a fast and prescribed the prayers to be said. None of this was of any avail.

But what can we do if the people today are not as good as the people of that generation?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">תענית כ״ד ב׳.</span></i>",
                "For the greater part of his life Rabah was very poor. As a result he had to depend on the aid of the Exilarch. The heads of the academy in Sura were rich, and usually maintained their students at their own expense. The heads of the academy in Pumbeditha, on the other hand, were poor folk and boxes had to be set up into which anyone who was able to do so threw his contribution to support the head of the academy of Pumbeditha and his students.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין ס׳ ב׳.</span></i>",

The historical accounts of these events are very meager, yet they were serious enough so that Rabah bar Nachmani lost his life through their effects. They came during the reign of king Sapor the Second. He ruled longer than any other Persian king before him or after him, sitting on the throne more than a full human life. (309-380 C. E.) He was crowned king before he was born for the priests placed the crown on the pregnant body of his mother, Ifra Hurmiz in sign that the unborn child was the king of Persia.",
                "Between King Sapor I, who was a friend of Samuel Yarchinai, and King Sapor II there was an interval of about seventy years (240-309 C. E.) In this interval six different kings ruled the Persians, and all maintained the tradition of friendship towards the Jews which had been established by king Sapor I. King Sapor II broke this tradition. Then all over the Persian kingdom persecution of the Jews broke out and because of the Jews the Christians too were persecuted.",
                "Yet the condition of the Jews at that time was better than that of the Christians because Queen Ifra Hurmiz protected the Jews to the extent of her ability. It is said that Queen Ifra Hurmiz had a strong leaning toward the Jewish religion and respected the Jewish scholars. When she saw how severely her son was oppressing the Jews, crushing the marrow out of their bones for taxes, she took a pot of gold to the academy at Pumbeditha and gave it to the scholars to be used as they saw fit. It was decided to use this money to help those Jews who could not pay their taxes and were in danger of being sent to jail by the king.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא בתרא ח׳ א׳.</span></i>",

The king sent out messengers to catch Rabah. Rabah heard of this and fled and hid among the swamps around Pumbeditha. He lost his way there and came to a forest and sat down under a tree. Suddenly he heard the footsteps of a man, and thinking that he was caught, he died of fright.",
                "This flight and hiding of Rabah bar Nachmani has been adorned with many miracles. It is related that once in the course of his flight he met the king’s messenger at an inn and was miraculously delivered from his hands. Then it is related how Rabah died in a miraculous manner. In the “academy of Heaven” a difference of opinion developed concerning a certain problem in the laws of ritual purity, and God Himself decided “pure”, and the rest of the academy decided “impure”. It was decided to call on Rabah bar Nachmani for his opinion because this was his special field. But this was impossible so long as he was alive and they sent out the Angel of Death to fetch Rabah. But the Angel of Death could not approach him because he did not cease studying a moment. Then the Angel of Death determined upon the above-mentioned trick, making Rabah think that he was caught, and he interrupted his study for a moment. The Angel of Death used this moment to seize his soul and bring it to the “academy of Heaven”. The scholars in Pumbeditha did not know what had happened to Rabah. A note fell from Heaven saying, “Rabah bar Nachmani has been summoned to the ‘academy of Heaven’.”",
                "Then Abayei and Rava along with other scholars went to seek Rabah’s corpse in order to bury it. They did not know the place where his body lay. They went to the swamps where Rabah had been hiding. They saw a flock of birds and the scholars said: “Apparently our dead is lying there.” They mourned for Rabah three days and three nights. Then another note fell from Heaven, upon which was written: “Whoever abandons the dead man now is excommunicated.” The scholars mourned for Rabah seven days longer.

For a long time they had been considered the two greatest scholars, and, as we have said, Rabah was called the “uprooter of mountains” meaning that he could tear up hills and grind them into dust by the power of his reasoning and Rav Joseph bar Chiya was called “Sinai” because all the laws of the Torah were as systematically arranged in his head as if he had heard them directly from the mouth of God on Mount Sinai. When the scholars wanted to appoint him head of the academy in Pumbeditha before they chose Rabah bar Nachmani, he went to consult an astrologer.",
                "This Rav Joseph bar Chiya, who is always called simply Rav Joseph without a patronymic, was born about 270 C. E. and died 333 C. E. He was a sick man, always ailing, and very irritable. He would say, “There are three kinds of people whose life is not worth living; merciful people, angry people and sensitive people, and I have inherited all these qualities.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים קי״ג ב׳.</span></i> It is related that later he grew even sicker and even became blind. He was not pained by the fact that he had to live in the darkness, but because he was exempt from all those commandments which require vision.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא קמא פּ״ז א׳.</span></i> Then Rav Joseph again suffered from a very severe illness, through which he lost his memory and all his learning. It then happened several times that some of Rav Joseph’s own laws came up in study and he said that he had never heard of them, and had to be reminded that they were his own.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין י׳ א׳, נדרים מ״א א׳.</span></i> Then he would say that just as the whole and the broken tablets of the Mosaic law lay side by side in the Holy Ark, so we must infer that when a scholar has forgotten his learning he must not be humiliated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מנחות צ״ט א׳.</span></i> Concerning his blindness it is not known whether this occurred before his last sickness and whether he remained blind until the end.",
                "Unlike Rabah bar Nachmani, Rav Joseph bar Chiya was a wealthy man, who owned gold and silver, fields and vineyards of such excellent quality that his wine could be diluted with twice as much water as could be mixed with ordinary wine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מנחות פ״ז א׳.</span></i> It sounds somewhat strange therefore when he says that “poverty suits a Jew like a red accoutrement suits a white horse.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">חגיגה ט׳ ב׳.</span></i>",
                "On his sixtieth birthday, when he invited other scholars to a feast he said, in a similar whimsical vein: “No matter how I misbehave I can no longer die young.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>",
                "Rav Joseph was different from his colleague Rabah in all his ways, in his private conduct as well as in his manner of studying. Though he was modest, he said “a teacher who has no regard for his dignity, has no dignity.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">קדושין ל״ב ב׳.</span></i> The difference between the scholarship of Rabah and that of Rav Joseph was many-sided. Rabah would usually depend upon his own reason and never hesitated if his opinion was that in the minority, and when he brought proof of his contentions they ordinarily were of a very complex sort and at first sight subject to objections of various sorts.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת כ״ג ב׳, ערובין י״ט ב׳, בבא בתרא ל״א א׳, עבודה זרה מ״א א׳.</span></i> Rav Joseph’s sayings were based, on the other hand, upon simple declarations and did not require complex reasoning, because he always kept the Mishnah and the Boraitha in mind, and avoided refinements and interpretations.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת י״ח א׳, ערובין כ״ט ב׳, כתובות פ״א ב׳, מנחות ע״ה ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Since it was known that Rav Joseph was acquainted with metaphysics and cosmology, he was often asked to teach these subjects to his students. He would never agree to do so, however, and when they pressed him hard he evaded them with a quotation, interpreting the verse “honey and milk under your tongue” to mean that when some subject is as good as honey and milk it should be kept under the tongue and not expressed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">חגיגה י״ג א׳.</span></i>",
                "Rav Joseph bar Chiya also paid much attention to the Aramaic translation of the Bible and especially to the “Haftaroth”. Since the masses understood very little Hebrew, the biblical portions that had to be read on Sabbath and holidays were to be read in the Babylonian tongue. Rav Joseph tried to prepare a correct translation of these synagogual readings in the Chaldean language, following the Greek translation of Aquilas (or Onkelos the convert) and this became the basis of our “Targum Onkelos.”",
                "He was very fond of using folk-proverbs in his scholarly statements, as for instance: “A master who makes a spoon may still burn his tongue with it when it is full of broth,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים כ״ח א׳.</span></i> or “even if you utter curses upon a dog’s tail, he will continue to do the same thing.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מועד קטן י״ז א׳.</span></i>",
                "Since Rav Joseph was very rich he fed his students at his own table, stating their number as about four hundred.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות ק״ו א׳.</span></i> It is said that he was very modest and was aware of it himself and when people said that since the death of Rabbi Judah Hanasi modesty had died out among the Jews, he said: “Do not say that, for I am here.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סוטה מ״ט ב׳.</span></i>",
                "Along with Rabah bar Abahu, Rav Joseph held that just as Jews should not leave Palestine to come to Babylon, so Babylonians should not leave their homes to go to another country, even not so far as from Pumbeditha to Be-Kobi, which was the nearest city. When someone left Pumbeditha for Be-Kobi, Rav Joseph excommunicated him. Another person left Pumbeditha for Asthonia, which is located in southern Mesopotamia, and he died at once.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות קי״א א׳.</span></i>",
                "When he was nearing his end, Rav Joseph wanted assurance that the Torah would remain in his family and he fasted forty days until he saw in a dream the verse “my words which I have placed in thy mouth will not pass from out of thy mouth” (Isaiah 59, 21). Not being satisfied with this he fasted forty more days until he was shown the verse “they shall not pass from thy mouth and from the mouth of thy seed.” When he fasted another hundred days he was shown the verse “they shall not pass from thy mouth and from the mouth of thy seed and from the mouth of the seed of thy seed.” With this he was satisfied, for knowing that his grandchildren would be scholars also, he believed that the Torah would remain in his family.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא מציעא פ״ה א׳.</span></i>"

            "Rabah bar Rav Huna": [
                "Rav Huna, the head of the academy in Sura, left a son named Rabah, who studied a great deal with his father and also inherited all his good qualities. When this Rabah bar Rav Huna died, the academy at Sura was orphaned, for it lacked a great central personality. Then the greater part of its students left it, and went to Pumbeditha to study. It seems that Rabah bar Rav Huna was fortunate enough to have studied under Rav and Samuel. He quoted many Talmudical sayings in their name. Later he went to Palestine and studied a short time under Rabbi Jochanan.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים צ׳ א׳, בבא בתרא קל״ה ב׳.</span></i> Later he headed his own academy, even while Rav Chisda, who succeeded Rav Huna to the position of the head of the academy in Sura, was still alive.",
                "It is certain that Rav Huna urged his son to be friendly with Rav Chisda because once when Rabah omitted his visits to Rav Chisda, Rav Huna punished him and Rabah had to defend himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת פ״ב א׳.</span></i> In addition Rabah was a judge in Rav Chisda’s court<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת י׳ א׳.</span></i> and Rav Chisda regarded him so highly that in spite of the difference in age Rav Chisda would often honor him by attending his lectures.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין מ״ו א׳.</span></i>",
                "Yet the achievements of Rabah bar Rav Huna in the development of the Talmud are practically unknown. It is known only that he was modest and would treat inferiors respectfully when dealing with them. In addition he was also quite rich, with fields and forests of his own from which he made his living.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא מציעא ק״ח א׳.</span></i> Even in later times Rabah’s modesty was still a matter of comment and many of the later “Amoraim” expressed the wish that they might attain to Rabah bar Rav Huna’s modesty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מועד קטן כ״ח א׳.</span></i>",
                "Rabah bar Rav Huna’s relations with the Exilarch are highly interesting. It is not clear how close these were. In spite of the fact that he would make the “holiday visits” to the Exilarch with Rav Chisda<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סוכה י׳ ב׳.</span></i> and when the Amora Ula once came to the Exilarch on the Sabbath he found Rabah there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת קנ״ז ב׳.</span></i> this is not to be taken as an unequivocal sign of loyalty and devotion, because it may be that these occurrences were limited to the time of Rav Chisda’s life. Later when Rabah bar Rav Huna became an independent leader of an academy in Sura, he once had a quarrel with the men of the Exilarch and he said: “I did not get my right to teach from you, but from Rav (Aba Arecha) and Rav got it from Rav Chiya and Rav Chiya got it from Rabbi Jehuda Hanasi.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין ה׳ א׳.</span></i>",
                "Rabah bar Rav Huna died at the same time as Rav Hamnuna and they were both brought for burial to Palestine. The two coffins were carried abreast all the way until they came to a narrow bridge where they had to go in single file one behind the other. The camels which bore the coffins stopped still before the bridge. A travelling merchant approached and asked why they had suddenly stopped. They told him that they were bringing two scholars to burial and each one desired his colleague to precede him. After the travelling merchant was told who the two scholars were, he said that Rabah bar Rav Huna should go first. They sent Rabah’s camel ahead. But this, it seems, did not please the dead scholar, because his camel kicked up his heels and knocked out the merchant’s teeth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">מועד קטן כ״ה ב׳.</span></i>"

            "Abayei bar Chyailil": [
                "W<small>HEN</small> R<small>ABAH BAR</small> R<small>AV</small> H<small>UNA</small> was at the head of the academy in Sura the Pumbedithans could not unite on a candidate for the position of head of the academy to take the place of Rav Joseph bar Chiya. There were four men who were considered for the position: Abayei bar Chyailil, Rava (Rav Aba bar Chama, the priest) Rav Zeira the second and Raba bar Matana. These four agreed to resolve some difficulty about a law and the one whose answer would be the best, clearest and unanswerable, would be crowned as the head of the academy of Pumbeditha. Abayei won this contest, because his remarks were not subject to criticism. Thus he was chosen as the head of the academy.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">הוריות י״ד א׳.</span></i>",
                "Abayei was born in the year 280 C. E. and died about 338 C. E. He is often called Nachmani after his grandfather Nachmani, the father of Rabah, at whose home he was brought up. His father died before he was born and his mother died in giving birth, and his uncle Rabah took the orphaned child to bring him up. He acquired his great legal learning from this uncle of his. He also inherited his depth and keenness from him. Besides this he was characterized by nobility of character and a pure-mindedness which was best expressed in the following saying: “A man should always be open-hearted in his dealings with God, friendly and careful, never to anger anyone. Particularly must he be at peace with his relations as well as with every other person, even a pagan in the street, so that he may be loved by all who are superior to him and welcome to all who are inferior.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות י״ז א׳.</span></i>",
                "With a childlike respect Abayei mentions his nurse who took the place of his mother and gave him various bits of counsel in life, and concerning human nature and the nature of the world. He quotes a score of her remarks with the greatest esteem as though they had been the sayings of some prominent Rabbi. He would usually preface these sayings with the words “my foster-mother said to me,” and all these quotations show that this nurse of Abayei must have been an extraordinary woman with a great deal of experience and broad understanding.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת קל״ד א׳, ערובין כ״ט ב׳, יומא ע״ח ב׳, מועד קטן י״ב א׳, כתובות י׳ ב׳.</span></i> It is probable also that this woman deserved the honor which Abayei paid her, for she cared for him like the apple of her eye, and saw that he lacked nothing, and was not disturbed in his studies. He said in one place that if his foster-mother had asked him to do the smallest thing, he would be disturbed in his studies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין ס״ה א׳.</span></i>",
                "Abayei owned gardens and vineyards which he ordinarily rented out to tenants for cultivation. Yet it is uncertain whether he was wealthy, because he led a modest life, as we see by the fact that when Abayei’s widow asked the court to grant her food and wine, they answered that as far as they knew there was never any wine on Abayei’s table.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">כתובות ס״ה א׳.</span></i>",
                "We may see how widespread was Abayei’s fame from the fact that even the Samaritans, who normally lived on bad terms with the Jews, were admirers of Abayei. Once they found a lost ass of his and they returned it on his saying that it was his, without asking for any signs of identification.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין מ״ה א׳.</span></i> It is therefore a puzzle why the number of students in Pumbeditha decreased to two hundred from the previous mass of thousands during the time that Abayei was head of the academy in Pumbeditha. We may assume that this decline in the number of students in Pumbeditha was not because the desire for learning grew suddenly weaker among the Jews of Babylon, but because all the students at that time tried to go to Mechoza, drawn by the personality of the head of the academy there, Rava, who, although he had the same system of study as Abayei, was nevertheless always found to be in conflicts with him, in which the students tended more to Rava’s side.",
                "Almost all the scholars at that time had ceased to feel the need to make new interpretations of the commandments of the Torah. As everybody thought then, the laws of the Jewish religion had already been interpreted in every possible way. It was at this time that Abayei and Rava began to turn up new problems which had not yet been covered by others. These were problems which developed out of the daily life of the people and had not previously been noticed. Their attempts to solve these problems as best they could are known in the Talmud as <span dir=\"rtl\">״הוויות דאביי ורבא״</span> (discussions of hypothetical cases which may sometimes arise.)",
                "In order to explain the nature of these <span dir=\"rtl\">״הוויות״</span> more clearly we will mention two of them. One question was as follows: When witnesses appeared and testified to a certain matter, and later others came and proved that those witnesses had lied, their credibility as witnesses was lost forever and they were no longer trusted. Now the problem is how far back did this losing of their credibility reach? Did it begin with their false testimony or only after the proof of the lie was established? For if these witnesses had signed documents or given true testimony in other matters during the interval between their false testimony and its proof of a lie, the question arises whether their signatures or their later testimony should be credited or not.",
                "The second question was whether a money-lender, getting collateral from the borrower has the rights of the owner to the property from the very first day of the loan and could dispose of it according to his own wishes or has he only the right to do so if it is clear that the borrower cannot or will not pay his debt?",
                "There are a number of different opinions about the length of time that Abayei was the head of the academy in Pumbeditha. Some say that is was only five years and others say that it was twelve or thirteen. Towards the end of Abayei’s life bad news began to be heard from Palestine. The Jews were being terribly oppressed by Emperor Constantius. Many refugees from Palestine arrived in Pumbeditha, bringing with them the learning of Rabbi Jochanan, and they aided in the further development of the law in Babylon.",
                "These people told Abayei, citing Rabbi Jochanan as their authority, that a woman whose two first husbands had died was allowed to wed a third time, for Rabbi Jochanan held that it could not be declared that such a woman was one whose husbands died because of her sins. Abayei accepted Rabbi Jochanan’s opinion and immediately married the beautiful woman Huma, a grandchild of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel, who had already been twice a widow. And after she married Abayei, he soon died at the age of fifty-eight.",
                "His name was Abayei bar Chyailil the priest, and as the “Chronicle of Rav Sherira Gaon” relates, this Chyailil was the brother of Rabah bar Nachmani. Neither the meaning of the name “Chyailil” nor that of “Abayei” is known. Some say about this that the name Abayei is an anagram of the verse <span dir=\"rtl\">״אשר בך ירוחם יתום״</span>. Others say that the name “Abayei” is a Syrian name, meaning solace, which is almost equivalent to Nachmani as others called him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת ל״ג א׳, נדרים נ״ד ב׳.</span></i> At the time when Abayei was born his uncle Rabah bar Nachmani was still a young man, not more than 17 years old. He was a student under Rav Judah bar Ezekiel in Pumbeditha. When Abayei had grown up somewhat his uncle immediately sent him to study in the academy of his own teacher. And even though the work there was beyond Abayei’s comprehension at the time, his uncle wished him to hear it anyway. When Abayei was mature enough to grasp what he was being taught, his teachers were Rabah bar Nachmani and Rav Joseph bar Chiya, who had become the leaders of the academy in Pumbeditha. Abayei acted towards his uncle like a pupil towards his teacher, with deep respect mixed with a certain childlike love. Rabah bar Nachmani also was always trying to fill up his young nephew with every variety of wisdom, and to sharpen his mind in every possible way.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות ל״ג א׳.</span></i> For Rav Joseph bar Chiya, Abayei felt nothing but respect. It is related that when Abayei saw the ears of Rav Joseph’s ass, as a sign that his teacher was approaching, he would stand up in respect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">קדושין ל״ג א׳.</span></i>",
                "Even when Abayei was still young he was famous for the depth of his learning. He had his own academy even when his teacher Rav Joseph bar Chiya was still alive.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא בתרא כ״ב א׳.</span></i> As we have said Rav Joseph once forgot his learning in his illness. Abayei would often remind him of his own laws. But even before this, Rav Joseph would discuss various problems with Abayei, treating him like a colleague and not like a student.",
                "Abayei grew up from childhood with his colleague Rava.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ברכות מ״ב א׳.</span></i> Later things developed in such a way that while Abayei was studying with Rabah bar Nachmani, Rava studied with Rav Nachman bar Jacob in Mechoza and Nehardea. This was the reason for the continuous differences of opinion between them which were always prosecuted in a friendly spirit. The phrase which the Talmud uses “Abayei and Rava who both say” refers to the time when they were studying together. In addition we find many times, “Abayei questioned Rava” or “Abayei explained to Rava.”",
                "Abayei was very scrupulous about the cleanliness of people who go out into the street. Since people were very careful to wash their hands and mouth before eating, Abayei said, “It is even more important to wash the hands and mouth after eating.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין י״ז ב׳.</span></i> Concerning the problem of leavened bread on Passover or after Passover, which must not be used, Abayei said that if a person uses it against his will he has not committed a sin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">פּסחים כ״ה ב׳.</span></i> Concerning a divorce he said that talk of giving a woman a divorce does not impose the obligation to do so.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין ל״ד א׳.</span></i> If a man says to a woman that he weds her with a gift of a previous loan, the marriage is not valid, but, if he says that he weds her with the gift of the interest on that loan, then the marriage is legal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">קדושין ז׳ ב׳.</span></i>",
                "If a witness came to court and testified that he saw a certain thing and later another witness proved that the first had lied, making his testimony inadmissible forever, Abayei said that this inadmissibility begins with the moment of the false testimony.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא קמא ע״ג א׳.</span></i> Concerning the mortgaged property of a debtor, Abayei said that the property belongs to the moneylender from the moment of the loan and he can dispose of it as if it were his own.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">גטין ל״ד א׳.</span></i>",
                "Another important problem was when someone lost something and gave it up for lost. This gave the finder the right to keep it.

We cannot deduce from this, however, that Abayei was the greater of the two. It is simply because Abayei became famous first by winning a contest for the position of the head of the academy of Pumbeditha. In addition it should be mentioned that even though Rava headed his own academy in Mechoza, he would often go to Pumbeditha to hear Abayei’s opinion in matters which he found somewhat difficult to decide by himself.",

Before he studied with Rav Nachman bar Jacob, Rava was a student of Rabah bar Avuha.

Rav Chisda asked the child which of the two students she wished to have for her husband, and the child answered, “I want both.” To this Rava answered: “First Rami will be her husband and then I.” And so it happened in fact.

I eat only what the Almighty has destined for me.” While they were speaking a sister of Rava arrived, whom he had not seen for thirteen years, and she brought with her a stuffed bird and old wine.

The victim died of his wounds. On hearing this the king wanted to punish Rava severely. The old queen said to him, “I pray you do not get into a fight with the Jews because whatever these people want, their God does for them.” “What, for instance, can their God do for them?” the king asked his mother with a skeptical smile upon his lips. “For instance, he gives them rain whenever they ask for it.” “Then let this Rava bring it about that now, suddenly in the month of Tammuz, there be rainfall, and I will remit his punishment,” said the king.

                "We should note that during the time of Rava’s life the greatest worry of the Babylonian scholars was to determine the beginning of a new month and the holidays since they always had to wait for the decision of the High Court in Palestine. Then Hillel the Second, the Nasi of Palestine, wished to introduce a radical change in the manner of determining the Jewish calendar. Times were such as made it a risk of life to send out messengers with the news of the observation of the new moon and the ratification of the new month by the High Court, even within Palestine itself. We can imagine what dangers were involved in sending messengers to Babylon. At that time Rav Huna bar Abin gave Rava the system of the leap years. The scholars also possessed the system of leap years composed by Samuel Yarchinai. Later Hillel II set up the Jewish calendar in such a way that anyone could figure out the beginnings of the months and the dates of the holidays by himself. It was provided however that even though the Babylonians would be able to determine the months by themselves they should nevertheless continue to observe the second day of the holidays as they did previously before they had correct calendars. Rava was very strict in this matter with himself, more even than with others and he used to observe “Yom Kippur” two days, for he thought that perhaps the High Court in Palestine had set the day of Yom Kippur one day later than he had done himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ראש השנה כ״א א׳.</span></i>"

He was called “Rav Chama of Nehardea.” But it may be that he was named so simply because he was born there, although his academy was in Pumbeditha. We are certain only that he was the head of the academy for 21 years, from 356 to 377 C. E.",
                "It is said that in the time when Rav Papa was the head of the academy in Nares and there was no academy in the whole of Palestine, king Sapor II of Persia once asked Rav Chama whether the burial of the dead was simply a folk-custom among the Jews or if it was a commandment of the Bible. The reason for this question was that the Persians, who worshipped fire, used to cremate their dead. King Sapor was not pleased with the Jewish custom of burial and he wished to order the Jews to burn their dead as the Persians did. Rav Chama of Nehardea was silent and did not answer the king’s question. At the moment, it seems, he did not know what to answer. Rav Acha bar Jacob heard of this and said: “The world has been handed over into the hands of fools who do not know that burial of the dead is a commandment of the Bible and when they are asked they forget the verse which says expressly, ‘for thou shalt bury him on that day.’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין מ״ו ב׳.</span></i>",
                "In Rav Chama’s times a great change in the government of the Roman Empire took place, which had a great influence upon the history of the Jews in Babylonia. Emperor Flavius Claudius Julianus, or as history calls him Julian the Apostate, because he denied the Christian religion, was educated in the ideas of the Greek philosophers and his teachers inculcated a love for the Greek idols. He abjured the Christian faith, which was the state religion of the Roman Empire already and attempted to reestablish the ancient Greek idolatry in its place.",
                "For a long time the Emperor Constantius had suspected that he had his eye upon the position of Roman Emperor. At first he drove him into exile, and later he made him his assistant in ruling, and after a successful attack upon the Germans who had fallen upon the northern districts of the Roman Empire, Julian had himself proclaimed Emperor by his soldiers. Hearing this the Emperor Constantius went out to attack the usurper with a great army. But Constantius died on the way. With this there was no longer any obstacle to Julian’s climb to the throne. Immediately he recognized the old Greek religion and had himself chosen as <i>“Pontifex maximus”.</i>",
                "He did not persecute the Christians, he simply took away from them those privileges which earlier Emperors had given them. In addition it is said that he lived simply, without luxury and superfluity. His philosophy taught him that the only task of a ruler was to extend his protection to all his subjects without regard to religion and he wished to apply his maxims to the rule of his land. Julian always manifested a particular interest in the condition of the Jews in the Roman Empire. Since Emperor Alexander Severus, the friend of Rabbi Judah N’siah II, there was no emperor of the Romans who took as much interest in the Jews as Julian. In his youth he read the writings of the Bible, and learned to respect the wisdom of the Jews; and after he became the Emperor of the Romans, he declared publicly that he regretted all the evil that his predecessors had done to the Jews. And since he undertook to revive the ancient Greek idolatry, he thought a great deal about sacrifices. He therefore was much taken with the idea of rebuilding the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, where God would be served with sacrifices.",
                "Many believe that Julian’s kindness had no more than political motives. They think that since he intended to destroy the Persian control over Babylonia and he began warfare against king Sapor, he wished to win over the Jews, for he knew that the Jews of Babylonia had great influence in politics, and therefore he made the announcement that he wished to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem.",
                "Julian did not content himself with a simple promise to build a Temple in Jerusalem, for in spite of having his hands full preparing the war against the Persians he set about the work of rebuilding the Temple in full earnest and appointed a special official, Alifius of Antioch, who had previously been the Roman governor of Britain. He instructed him also not to spare any money in building the Temple but to finish it quickly. At the same time he sent an imperial command to the governors of Syria and Palestine to support Alifius in his work and supply him with all necessaries.",
                "All the materials were ready in Jerusalem. Great camps of workers were clearing away the ruins which had accumulated on the site of the Temple in the three centuries since its destruction. When they had cleared away the wreckage, the gases suddenly exploded and many workers were killed. This was regarded as a sign from Heaven that God did not wish the Jewish Temple to be rebuilt. Thus the history of Emperor Hadrian’s times repeated itself, for Emperor Hadrian too wanted to have the Temple rebuilt and the work was interrupted by an explosion of gases while the debris was being removed. It was said then that the Almighty did not wish to allow His Temple to be rebuilt by the same people who had destroyed it.",
                "It is noteworthy that the Jews were not enthusiastic about the project. In the Jewish books of the time it is not even mentioned. Only Christian chronicles relate that the Jews sent gold and silver from all corners of the earth for the construction of their Temple. It is possible that previous experience of failure in revolutions against the Romans discouraged the Jews from any adventure with them, lest it fail and they have to pay dearly for its failure. In any case, before the Jews had a chance to study the matter it was too late, because Emperor Julian ruled no more than twenty months, and after twenty months of his rule he died in the war against the Persians in 363 C. E. at the age of thirty-two.",
                "In his war against the Persians Julian wished to break king Sapor’s might in Babylonia. His dream was that the Roman eagle should spread his wings over the Tigris. King Sapor wanted not merely to maintain his rule over the land of Babylonia but to drive the Romans out of Asia entirely. Between these two giants the small people of Israel stood as between two fires. The end of this conflict of the Titans was not good for the Jews, both as to the attitude of king Sapor and as to the attitude of Julian’s successors."

Once when there was a debate about the question of whether a prisoner should be considered as dead and his children permitted to receive their inheritance even though it is not certain that he had died, an attempt was made to derive this law from the verse “and I shall kill you and your children will be orphans and your wives widows.” It was remarked that if God wanted to kill anyone there was no need to add that his children would be orphans and his wives widows, since this was self-evident. Then what was the purpose of these words in the verse? We must infer therefore that the verse intimates that the widow of the dead man would desire to remarry and would not be allowed to do so and his children would desire to inherit his property and they would not be allowed to do so. This interpretation was told to Rav Sheshet by one of his students as an answer to the problem, and Rav Sheshet said to him: “I see that you are one of those people from Pumbeditha who can drive an elephant through the eye of a needle.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא מציעא ל״ה ב׳.</span></i>",

He had a bed set up for him there until the building was finished.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">בבא בתרא ג׳ ב׳.</span></i> Then he built a splendid school so that there would be room for his students as well as for the auditors who came to hear his lectures in the “lecture months” of Adar and Elul of every year. He never allowed the people of Matha Mechasia to build their roofs higher than the roof of the synagogue or the academy, because he believed in an old saying of Rav (Aba Arecha) that a city whose dwelling houses are taller than its synagogues or its academies was doomed to destruction. He said therefore that this rule of his saved Matha Mechasia from destruction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת י״א א׳.</span></i>",
                "According to many historians Rav Ashi occupied the post of head of the academy in Matha Mechasia all of sixty years. At the same time the academy at Nehardea regained some of its former splendor, under its head Amemar. The same thing took place at Pumbeditha. There were eight heads there during Rav Ashi’s days. But not a single one of the “Amoraim” reached the heights of Rav Ashi who was listened to by everyone and supported in his efforts to regulate religious life. Even the two Exilarchs of that time (Rav Cahana and Mar Zutra) who were recognized scholars and also rulers of the country always looked up to Rav Ashi and followed his words.",
                "There was a custom in those days that the Exilarch used to come for a visit once a year to those cities where the best academies of Babylonia were in order to receive the greetings of the Jewish communities. Even though there were several academies of importance in Rav Ashi’s time, the Exilarch came only to Sura which was near Matha Mechasia. Usually this would take place on the Saturday during which the chapter <i>“Lech-l’cha”</i> was read, in the beginning of the month Marcheshvan. This was the festival Sabbath in honor of the Exilarch who would then make a feast in honor of the head of the academy. In Sura or in Matha Mechasia also the “assemblies” would convene at which the Exilarch made his reports concerning the political situation. Although the Exilarch lived in a different city, he used to call these assemblies to Sura during Rav Ashi’s time. The city Matha Mechasia, therefore, became the capital of Jewish life in Babylonia to which almost all the Jews of the land would assemble during the “lecture months” (Elul and Adar) when the head of the academy would lecture about the laws of the holidays; as well as upon a holiday sabbath when the people came to greet the Exilarch, or when they gathered for a general assembly.",
                "Since Rav Ashi united all the virtues, surpassing all the men of his times, he also had the ability to undertake the great task of compiling and arranging all the legal decisions and religious interpretations of the Mishnahs, as well as the Boraithoth and Tosefthoth, in one great work out of which the Babylonian Talmud later developed. One reason for the collection of this work was probably the desire to facilitate the preservation of all this religious and legal material which kept on growing from generation to generation in order to perpetuate its memory among men and to maintain it alive in their hearts. After many of those interpretations and decisions had been forgotten, as Rav Ashi complained, and the memory of people seemed to be growing weaker, he said that “if the hearts of former generations were as wide as the gates of a palace, our hearts are as narrow and insignificant as the eye of a needle.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">ערובין נ״ט א׳.</span></i> Since the time of Rav (Aba Arecha) the material of scholarship had increased so much that it surpassed the capacity of human memory. Rav Ashi collected all this material and had it written down so that it would not be forgotten.",
                "It seems that Rav Ashi occupied the seat of the head of the academy in Matha Mechasia for sixty years, and he spent all this time in collecting all the interpretations of the Talmud which had accumulated in the various academies. He was very careful and wrote things into his collection only after long scrutiny. In the “lecture months” of each year when all of Rav Ashi’s students would assemble from all corners of Babylonia, he would assign a given topic for study or a section of that topic to be discussed by the scholars and the students. In this way the whole of the Mishnah and the Talmud were divided into sixty parts (<span dir=\"rtl\">מסכתות</span>). Thus Rav Ashi completed the division of the Mishnah, the great work of Rabbi Judah Hanasi 200 years back. This was a very difficult task, not to be compared with the editing of the Mishnah, which contained short, simple statements of the laws of the Torah, as they were interpreted at that time. Incidental matters and details were collected separately in the “Boraithoth”. The “Gemara”, however, contains everything and excludes nothing which has the slightest connection with the topic under discussion.",
                "The Babylonian Talmud became the cornerstone of the further development of the Jewish people. Rav Ashi did not finish this immense work. He was the one who felt that the time had at last come to assemble all the material. Each academy had had its own system of interpreting the Mishnah, which was taught at that academy. The urge to find new interpretations of the commandments was still alive. Rav Ashi could not restrain himself merely to collecting and arranging the matter, because he was called upon to decide all sorts of differences of opinion at the same time and to resolve doubts and supply explanations where they were needed.",
                "For almost the whole of the time that Rav Ashi was head of the academy in Matha Mechasia the Persian king Yezdigerd the Second ruled the land. His religious conduct was displeasing to the Persian priests and they called him “the sinner.” He was criticized particularly for his behavior towards the Jews, whom he protected from harm so long as he ruled. The Babylonian academies, three in number, flourished under his protection. Jews were invited to all the court celebrations, and the heads of the three academies, Rav Ashi of Matha Mechasia and Sura, Mar Zutra of Pumbeditha, and Amemar of Nehardea, had to represent the Jews among the prominent leaders of the realm who were present at all the feasts in the king’s house.",
                "King Yezidgerd lavished special honors upon the Exilarch of the time, Rav Huna bar Nathan. It is related that the Exilarch once appeared before the king wearing a girdle under his sleeves after the fashion of ordinary people. The king lowered his girdle to his loins and said: “You Jews are the priests of God Almighty and should wear your girdles after the fashion of our priests.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">זבחים י״ט א׳.</span></i>",
                "In those days finally arrived the historic day of reckoning for the Roman Empire. On all sides Rome was pounded by different enemies. Internal conflict and outer war united for the same purpose, and any clear-eyed person could see that the days of the Roman Empire were numbered. There were many Jews who saw these political complications as signs of the advent of the Messiah. At the same time the “Book of the Jubilees” from the Apocrypha became known among the people in which all the historic occurrences of the world were reckoned according to the count of the jubilee years. It was found that this book stated that the world had only eighty-five jubilee-years for the count of its existence. They calculated that this meant that the year 439 C. E. would mark the end of the world, and since this year was rapidly approaching, they expected the near arrival of Messiah.",
                "All these fantasies inflamed the imaginations of the people and they fell easy prey to all sorts of cranks. Such a movement was started in Crete in Rav Ashi’s days and the Jews there were deluded into following a crank. He was a semi-lunatic who called himself Moses. He promised his following to perform miracles like those Moses performed in leading the Jews out of Egypt. He would lead them through the Mediterranean Sea to Palestine and the sea would dry up under their feet. The Jews of Crete believed in him and abandoned their work and their property and followed their Messiah who would split open the sea for them like Moses of old. At last the day came when the new Moses had promised the great miracle to occur. Moses went ahead and all the Jews of Crete with their wives and children followed him to the shore of the sea. There the new Messiah stood at the crest of a cliff and ordered his followers to jump into the sea and it would split immediately. Following the precedent of Moses, for whom Nachshon ben Aminadav sprang into the sea and it opened up when he was standing neck-deep, all the followers of the new Moses sprang into the sea. All but a small remnant were drowned. Sailors who were out on the sea in small boats saved those who survived.",
                "Meanwhile the Roman Empire came nearer to its doom with every passing day. The Romans were fanatical Christians at the time, full of hatred for the Jews. One after another the academies in Palestine were shut down, and the love of learning was almost extinct there. At the same time the power of the Jewish “Nasi”, whose position had been the most brialliant light in the darkness of the Exile previously, was destroyed. After the “Nasi” Rabbi Hillel the Second, who introduced the regular calendar, there were three N’siim: Rabban Gamaliel V, Rabbi Jehudah N’siah III, and Rabban Gamaliel VI. But the position of Nasi was without practical importance. The government no longer supported the Nasi. It merely demanded that he squeeze the last penny out of the Jews for taxes, and in order to cover the expenses of his establishment, the Nasi had to send agents to all the communities of the Jewish Diaspora to collect charity.",
                "Theodosius the Great was Emperor then and he always protected the Jews, even though the Christian priests always agitated against them and threatened that Theodosius’ soul would burn in Hell because he did not assist in the persecution of the Jews. Theodosius paid no attention but he issued a decree which permitted the Nasi to continue to excommunicate anyone whom he considered harmful to the Jewish community. He forbade anyone to interfere with the inner government of the Jews and in their internal quarrels. The justice of Emperor Theodosius for the Jews was best proven, when the Nasi Rabban Gamliel V complained that the Roman Consul Hesichius had robbed him of many valuable documents. Calling the Consul for a hearing, the Emperor found him guilty and sentenced him to death. Theodosius was hard put to it to soothe the fanatical hatred of the priests for the Jews. They were continually trying to disturb the Jews at their worship. Whenever the Jews would erect a synagogue, they were subjected to all sort of trouble, their synagogues were pilfered, sacred objects were stolen and fire would be set to the building.",
                "The outstanding figures in this destructive mania were John Chrysostom of Antioch and Ambrosius of Milan in Italy. Chrysostom was enraged when he saw that many of the Christians were sympathetic to the Jews. Every Saturday and holiday certain Christians would come to the Jewish synagogue for religous inspiration. Especially aristocratic ladies were known to visit the synagogue regularly, fast on Yom Kippur and sit in a Succah. When Christians fell out between themselves they would often choose to go before a Jewish court because they knew that they would get justice there. This was something Chrysostom could not bear and he fought against with all his strength.",
                "Meanwhile other occurrences enraged Chrysostom still further. In Rome the Christians burned a Jewish synagogue. The Emperor ordered the Senate to rebuild the synagogue at the expense of the Roman Christians. On another occasion the bishop of Kalinikat in northern Mesopotamia ordered his priests to tear down the Jewish synagogue. Theodosius not only ordered him to rebuild the synagogue at his own expense, but made him punish all those who took part in the destruction. On hearing this Chrysostom was fearfully angry and threatened the Emperor with the fiercest pains of Hell until he was forced to rescind the bishop’s punishment.",
                "In order to put a stop to all these attacks upon the Jews, Theodosius issued a proclamation which declared that the Jewish religion had always been allowed in Rome and the Jews were always recognized as citizens. Then the Emperor ordered all his consuls to punish anyone who disturbed the peace of the Jewish religion or who destroyed their synagogues.",
                "Wishing to secure the safety of his successors’ empire, Emperor Theodosius divided it into two parts: the western part of the Empire with the city of Rome as the capital divided from the eastern part with its capital in Byzantium. This arrangement did not secure the peace of the Empire, however, and the Jews had to suffer in both parts of the Empire. They knew, however, how to soften the wrath of their rulers by the use of coin. In this way it came about that the Emperor issued a proclamation that protected the Jews from attack, just as the Jewish Nasi was protected from insult. The Emperor’s proclamation ordered the rulers not to allow the mobs to attack Jewish synagogues. He also renewed the rule that the Jewish N’siim were exempt from taxes in each country just like Christian priests. In addition he ordered that disputes between Jews be settled in the Jewish court, and the Roman officials were to support the Jewish courts in the execution of their decisions.",
                "In the time of Emperor Theodosius II (in Byzantium) Jewish gifts could accomplish very little. The Emperor prohibited the building of new synagogues and he denied the Jewish courts the right to judge disputes between Jews and Christians. In this Emperor’s time the office of Nasi was abolished. The last Nasi of the Jews was Rabban Gamaliel VI, the son of Rabbi Judah N’siah III. He was more honored in the royal court than all his predecessors. In all this esteem however, there was not the least hint of power. It is related that he received some titles for his great learning in medicine, especially for having found a remedy for a sick spleen.",
                "He was in error, however, if he thought that he could accomplish anything for the good of his people. Thinking that he was not required to obey the letter of all the imperial commands, he built new synagogues and judged disputes between Jews and Christians. The result was that Theodosius revoked all his titles and took away all his importance as Nasi. This happened in 415 C. E. The Emperor left him only the title of Nasi without any power. Without leaving any children the line of N’siim in Palestine was broken after five centuries and fifteen generations, when he died in 426 C. E.",
                "And these are the names of all the “N’siim”: Rabban Gamaliel the Old, Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel, Rabban Gamaliel of Javneh, Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel II, Rabbi Judah Hanasi, Rabban Simeon ben Rabbi Judah Hanasi. Rabbi Judah N’siah, Rabbi Gamaliel ben Rabbi Judah N’siah, Rabbi Judah N’siah II, Rabbi Gamaliel V, Rabbi Judah N’siah III, Rabbi Hillel (II), Rabbi Gamaliel ben Rabbi Hillel, Rabbi Judah N’siah IV, and Rabbi Gamaliel VI."

                "F<small>OR HUNDREDS OF YEARS</small> the Jews of Babylonia lived in peace and quiet and knew nothing of persecution. They made their living from agriculture and trade. And since they lacked for nothing and the government protected their lives, they were able to devote themselvs to learning and observe the commandments of the Torah. The Jews were especially well off under the rule of the Parthians who defeated the Chaldeans and conquered their land. But even later under the Persians only the early years were bad, when the Persians were still religious fanatics and had not learned to be tolerant to people of other faiths. Later the situation changed and the Jews entrenched themselves in complete security as a “nation within a nation.” The cities where the great academies were to be found, were purely Jewish cities and governed themselves. The Jews lived in Babylonia as though in their own state, which had only to pay taxes to the central government and had the right to protection from outside enemies in return.",
                "Those good times suddenly changed, and the former difficulties with king Sapor the Second were made to seem like mere sport by the troubles which the Jews suffered later. Since the scholars decided that the government had resolved to destroy the Jewish people and its religion, they felt that the time had come finally to colect all the documents of Jewish tradition, and save them from oblivion and all mischances. The Babylonian Talmud was created which contained all the creations of the Jewish spirit and everything the Jews had thought from the last prophets to Rav Ashi and Ravina.",
                "It is a revealing fact that about thirty years after the death of Rav Ashi the leaders of the academy in Matha Mechasia near Sura were merely nominal leaders, for their work made no impression upon the life of the Jews, and in Pumbeditha conditions were still worse. One of the most prominent among those heads of the academy was Rav Nachman bar Huna, a student of Rav Ashi’s. After his death they were about to choose for his successor a son of Rav Ashi by the name Tavyomi, who had long deserved to occupy that position. This son is known in the Talmud as “Mar bar Rav Ashi.” Various elements interfered with the choice of Tavyomi with their intrigues. Then another Amora, named Rav Acha Midifto, who was related to the Exilarch, was chosen as head of the academy in Matha Mechasia. While this was happening Mar bar Rav Ashi was away on a trip to Mechoza. The news hurt him very much for he had set his heart on filling his father’s post.",
                "When it became known that Mar bar Rav Ashi had returned from his trip, the scholars in Matha Mechasia realized that they should have asked his opinion about the man whom they had chosen to fill the post that should rightly have been his. They sent two scholars to meet him and tell him whom they had chosen as head of the academy. Tavyomi kept the two scholars and would not let them depart. They sent two other scholars. Tavyomi kept them also. The same thing was repeated until Tavyomi had ten scholars with him. Then he answered their report of the election of a new head of the academy with a lecture which so enthralled them that they ended by begging him to become the head of their academy, and he accepted the post.",
                "This happened in the year 456 C. E. In the same year the terrible persecutions of the Jews broke out, unparalleled in the previous history of Babylonia. The persecutions were carried out by a concerted campaign of slaughter and murder which aimed at the total extinction of the Jews.",
                "Mar bar Rav Ashi was the greatest of the later “Amoraim” and his contemporaries were fully aware of his importance so that his opinions were law. Nevertheless he was unable to restore the academy in Sura to its former importance. He continued the work of his father in the compilation of the Talmud. He also gathered all the legal rulings of his father and cleared up some obscure points in his father’s teachings. Beyond this very little is known of him. Because of the troubles of that time there is no record of the accomplishments of a whole series of important scholars who lived then.",
                "The Jews suffered particularly at that time from the hand of king Yezdigerd (Harmizdas) the Third who was a very evil person and bore a special hatred to the Jews. His first step was to prohibit the observance of the Sabbath. At the same time he shut down the academies.",
                "There are various legends which purport to explain the reasons which caused this sudden wrath of the Persian kings against the Jews who had always been loyal and true to them. The true reason is simply religious fanaticism. Since the Persian priests had a strong desire to convert the Jews to their faith, they sought every opportunity for religious debates; in these contests the Jews did not spare the religious beliefs of the Persians and insulted them together with their idols. The priests were terribly enraged and began to persecute the Jews as enemies of their faith.",
                "In one such debate between a Persian priest and the head of the academy of Nehardea, Amemar, the priest was determined to prove that the universe was ruled by two divinities, Ormuzd, who was the god of light and life, and Ahriman who was the god of darkness and destruction. Seeing that Amemar would not be convinced, he tried to argue on the analogy of the human body, the upper half of which belonged to Ormuzd because it is the seat of the understanding and all good sensations, and the lower half belonged to Ahriman, because the beastly part lies there. Amemar answered that the analogy with the human body would not hold, because a god like Ahriman should not have allowed the whole of human filth to be borne through the canals of his kingdom. Amemar said further that in the universe too there was no boundary between good and evil for they were both derived from the same God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">סנהדרין ל״ט א׳.</span></i>"

The academies were reopened in Sura and Pumbeditha. The heads of these two rebuilt academies were appointed. The head of Sura was Ravina (Rav Avina) and a certain Rav Joseph, of whom very little is known, was chosen head of Pumbeditha.",
                "We must note that a generation later there was another Ravina who was a brother’s son to this Ravina, who was active as an “Amora”, and according to the “Chronicle of Rav Shrira Gaon” his name was Rav Avina the son of Rav Huna. This Ravina was a student of his uncle and in order to make a distinction between them the scholars called him “Ravina the younger”.",
                "It seems that Ravina was head of the academy in Sura not more than one year, from 499 to 500 C. E. In those days the Babylonian “Amoriam” saw only one purpose for their work and this was to finish the great work begun by Rav Ashi in compiling the Talmud. The contemporary persecutions were the cause for the decrease in the numbers of the students and the decline of the influence of the Torah upon the life of the Jews. In Palestine there had long ceased to be any academies and in Babylonia evil monarchs sought to bring about the same condition in their own land. The “Amoraim” understood that in order to save the spiritual treasures of the Jewish people, created by its scholars in the course of so many centuries they would have to hasten the completion of the Talmud which Rav Ashi had begun.",

                "When Ravina is mentioned he is usually coupled as a second after Rav Ashi, even though it seems that Ravina was the older of the two. He outlived Rav Ashi by a long time.

As an outstanding student of Rav, Ravina would often go from Matha Mechasia to Mechoza where Rava had his academy to listen to Rava’s interpretation of the Torah, or to ask some question concerning a matter of law. Ravina grew in learning before the eyes of Rava. And when the people of Mechoza once addressed an inquiry to Ravina, Rava permitted him to instruct them and to answer their questions according to his understanding. He did not wish to do this in Mechoza, however, for Rava was active there. Not being the head of any academy at the time he would travel through the large cities of Babylonia and wherever he would stop, he would set up the tent of the Torah and he would teach there even while Rava was still alive.

The behavior of the last two kings towards the Jews had proved how little the favors of monarchs could be depended upon, and how uncertain was Jewish existence. There was a danger therefore that if everything was not written down that had been created by the scholars after Rabbi Judah Hanasi, the learning of the Jews might be forgotten. They desired to collate everything that had been said since the edition of the Mishnah, to select and arrange it critically. All the scholars proposed to Rav Ashi the inclusion of their own words or of what they had had from their teachers and whatever met the approval of Rav Ashi was included in the canon of the “Gemara”.",
                "Of the scholars who assisted Rav Ashi in his work, there is first of all Ravina, and besides him the following scholars: Rav Acha bar Rava, Rav Mordecai, Rav Hillel, Rav Acha bar Ivia, Rava Mibarnish, Rav Yemar, Rav G’vihah from Bei K’sil, Rabah Zuti, Rav Asi and Rav Aba from Palestine who told Rav Ashi all the customs of Palestine in the observance of the law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11)</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><span dir=\"rtl\">שבת ק״ג ב׳, גטין ל״ד ב׳.</span></i>",

Just as the “Amoraim” of Palestine had formerly included the sayings of the Babylonian scholars in their Talmud, so the Babylonians now included the wisdom of Palestine.",
                "There was no system of arranging the sayings in the Talmud of Jerusalem. The Babylonian Jews, living in relatively secure circumstances, had a better chance to assemble, to debate and agree on the order of the work. Because of the unceasing persecutions, the Palestinian scholars never had the chance to arrange their Talmud patiently as it should have been arranged. Therefore the “Jerusalem Talmud” remained a fragmentary thing unsuited to be a “national work,” for much of it certainly was lost and the lost portion may have been the finest and the best. Only a small part of the Jerusalem Talmud was saved from oblivion by those Palestinian scholars who succeeded in escaping to Babylonia. It is therefore a great merit of those scholars who edited the Babylonian Talmud that they gave us all the conjectures in law that were in the Jerusalem Talmud. Further we must make note that a great part of the Babylonian Talmud, even a majority of the sayings included, came from Palestinian scholars.",
                "It may be assumed also that the Jerusalem Talmud was well known in Babylonia and everything in it which fell in with the Babylonian laws was included in the Babylonian Talmud. Thus the Jew and the Talmud are a twin birth, and even if certain periods of Jewish history spent less time in the study of the Talmud, its ruling spirit was inherited by every period of Jewish history and strongly influenced their character. Various historical causes brought it about that the Babylonian Talmud and not the Jerusalem Talmud became the unchallenged ruler of Jewish life, and formed its every detail so that anyone who wanted to renounce it, renounced God’s covenant with His people."
