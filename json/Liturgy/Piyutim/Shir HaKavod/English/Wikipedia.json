            "His splendor is on me, and my splendor is on Him; He is close to me when I call to him.",
            "White and red, His garments are red; He trod the winepress when He came from Edom.",
            "He showed His tefillin-knot to the humble one; the picture of God was before his eyes.",

Your, Lord, is the sovereignty and the rule over every king. Who can recount the heroic acts of the Lord, who can do justice to all His praise?"
