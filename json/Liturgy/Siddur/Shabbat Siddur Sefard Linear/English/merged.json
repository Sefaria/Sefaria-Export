It was only due to the strenuous advocacy of Rabbi Akiva that all doubts as to its propriety were dis- pelled. “Heaven forbid!” he said. “There could never be any doubt about the sanctity of Shir Hashirim. If the rest of the Writings are holy, then Shir Hashirim is the holy of holies.” (Mishnah, Yedayim 3:5) He saw in it, the passionate yearning which subsists between God and Israel, a love which “Many waters cannot quench, neither can the rivers drown” (8:7).</small>",

            "Recitation of Shema": [
                "<small>The recitation of Shema was part of the daily worship in the Holy Temple, and our Sages ordained that it be recited in the synagogue service, providing it a central place in the morning and evening prayers of each Jew. Its importance may be judged from the fact that the very first Mishnah in the Oral Torah opens with the question, “From what time may the evening Shema be read?”</small>",
                "<small>In reading Shema, bear in mind that you are performing a Scriptural commandment. All three paragraphs should be read with <i> kavanah,</i> concentrated intention, on what you are saying. The entire Shema should be recited in awe and reverence as it proclaims the existence and unity of God; the Jews' complete dedication to God and His commandments; the belief in Divine justice; the remembrance of the Exodus and the selection of the Jews as God's Chosen People. These concepts are the pillars of the Jewish faith. Whenever this sign (°) appears (e.g. בְּכָלּ־לְּבָבְ֒ךָ), it indicates that you should be careful to pronounce each word distinctly. In many instances, the last letter of the first word and first letter of the second word are the same, the words might be read as one, which is not the proper way to fulfill the mitzvah of Kerias Shema.</small>",
                "<small>The following three words should be said when praying without aminyan:</small>",

This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word שְׁמַע and last letter of אֶחָד are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word עֵד “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to God’s unity.— Avudraham  Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on God’s unity. The last word, אֶחָד “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that God, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Israel, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.</i>",

Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Israel” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Jacob said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moses did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Jacob ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a. When Moses went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise God by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם aloud.— Midrash Rabba to Deuteronomy </i>",

Our Sages ordained these three separate forms to signify three kinds of Sabbath—the Sabbath of creation, the Sabbath on which the Torah was given at Sinai, and the Sabbath of the World to Come.

The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to God. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt-offering which is consumed in its entirety on God’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve God but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים , peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to God, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i>",
