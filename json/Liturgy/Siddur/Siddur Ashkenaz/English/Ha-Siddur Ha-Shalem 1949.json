This day you are leaving, in the month of Aviv. And when the Lord will bring you into the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivvite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers He would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you shall perform this service in this month. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival in honor of the Lord. Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen in your possession, nor any leaven, anywhere in your territory. And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: This is on account of what the Lord did for me when I left Egypt. It shall serve as a sign on your hand, and as frontlets between your eyes, so that the Lord's teaching may be ever in your mouth; for by a strong hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt.

Every firstling ass, however, you shall redeem with a lamb; but if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every first-born son of yours you shall redeem. And when your son asks you in time to come: What does this mean? You shall tell him: By a strong hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of a house of slavery. And when Pharaoh made difficulties about letting us go, the Lord slew every first-born in the land of Egypt, the first-born of both man and beast; that is why I sacrifice to the Lord every first-born male animal, but I redeem all my first-born sons.

On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place at a distance. Then Abraham said to his servants: \"You stay here with the ass while I and the boy go yonder: we will worship and come back to you.\" So Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on his son Isaac, while he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and the two of them went off together. Then Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said: \"My father\"; and he answered: \"Here I am, my son.\" And he said: \"Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?\" Abraham answered: \"God will provide himself with the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.\" So the two of them went on together. They came to a place which God had told him, and Abraham built the altar there, arrange the wood, bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham put out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from the heavens: \"Abraham, Abraham,\" and he answered: \"Here I am.\" He said: \"Do not lay your hand on the boy, and do nothing to him; for I know now that you revere God, seeing that you have not refused me your son, your only son.\" Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; so Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it as a burnt-offering instead of his son. Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-yireh, as it is said to this day: \"The mount where the Lord reveals himself.\" The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from the heavens, and said: \"By myself I swear,\" says the Lord, \"that since you have done this, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, I will indeed bless you, and will surely make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky or as the sands on the seashore; your descendants shall possess the cities of their enemies, and through your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed—because you have obeyed my voice.\" Abraham then returned to his servants, and they started together for Beersheba, for Abraham dwelt in Beersheba.",

Be lenient with us, Lord our God, and deal with us kindly and mercifully. In Your great goodness, may Your fierce wrath turn away from Your people, Your city, Your land, and Your heritage. Fulfill, Lord our God, what You promised us through Moses Your servant, as it is said: \"I will remember my covenant with Jacob; also my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.\""

Sing to the Lord, you who are godly, and give thanks to his holy name. For his anger only lasts a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may lodge with us at evening, but in the morning there are shouts of joy. I thought in my security I would never be shaken. O Lord, by Your favor You established my mountain as stronghold; but when Your favor was withdrawn, I was dismayed. To You, O Lord, I called; I appealed to my God: \"What profit would my blood be, if I went down to the grave? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness? Hear, O Lord, and be gracious to me; Lord, be my helper.\" You have changed my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and girded me with joy; so that my soul may praise You, and not be silent.
