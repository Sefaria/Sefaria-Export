One Maneh daily – half in the morning and half in the evening and the three extra maneh – where those of which the Chief Kohen entered [the holy of holies] and took from them a full palm-full on the Yom Kippur – he would return them to the grinder on the eve of Yom Kippur, in order to accomplish the mitzvah – in the finest of finest [way] and 11 spices were in it – and these are they:",

Salt of Sodom – a quarter [of a kav.] An ascension of smoke – a small amount. Rabbi Nathan, the Babylonian, says – even the resin of the Jordan – a bit. If he put in it honey it is invalid and if he omitted one from all of its spices, he is liable for death [penalty]. ",

The Lye of Karsina, what does it come [to do]? – in order to rub the onycha in order for it to be beautiful. The wine of Cyprus, why is it brought? in order to soak in it the Onycha, in order for it to be sharp. But is not urine – better [to make it sharp] – rather we do not bring in urine into the Sanctuary out of respect.",

The incense compound divided in half is Kosher. For a third or a-quarter we did not hear [the law]. Rabbi Yehuda said “This is the general rule – if it is in the same proportion – it is Kosher for half, &amp; if it lacks one from all of the spices – he is liable for the death penalty. ",
                "Bar Kapara taught once every sixty or seventy years there were remains [of the spices] of half. And Bar Kapparah also taught , if one was to add a Kartov [a measure] of honey a person would not be able to stand because of the fragrance. And why do we not mix in it honey? Because the Torah says  “For any leaven or any honey, do not offer incense from it – as a fire offering. L·rd of hosts, is with us. He is our refuge for us the G·d of Yaakov / Jacob forever. L·rd of hosts, happy is the man that has faith in You. L·rd save, the King will answer us on the day we call.

He approached, he and all of his nation, to take vengeance against me; and they set up a war with them. My lofty One and my Savior, make war against my enemy and my humiliator; make them drink a fully mixed cup (of poison), Lord, my Shephard, my Shield and the Horn of my salvation! ",
                "On the tenth month, the enemy pursued me with a sword. On the tenth of the month, he prepared an ambush for me. And over this I lament, and my joy has waned. Woe to us, as the day is setting, for the shades of the evening are being cast. [May] the evening turn to morning, and the conspirators no longer rise high. Show grace to Your people, and spread a salve on their pain. Remember for me the covenant of the forefathers when I spread out the palms of my hands to You, 'Bringer of death and Giver of life; He who casts down to the grave and brings up.'",
                "On the tenth month, the Coyote growls against my people. On the tenth of the month, he devoured all that came out from them. A Leopard is constant against their cities. They burnt down their cities with fire in the many calamities. Rise up, Lord, to desolate the wanton ones with Your power. They will be greatly shamed when You perform a goodly sign for us, Holy One of Israel, Lord of Hosts! ",
                "On the tenth month, the hands of the enemy held a shield and armor. On the tenth of the month, like a man prepared for war against the 'faithful town.' Because of this, gentle community, gird sackcloth; remove your crown and cast it away; raise the dirge to the mountains. Your people calls out a dirge before You on this day, and our eyes flow with water upon the destruction of Your house. Arouse the day of vengeance against the enemies that roar in Your house! 'Let me know Your paths, Lord; teach me Your ways.'",
                "On the tenth month, my oppressors raised an embankment against my city. On the tenth of the month, the ones who made my wound an inheritance surrounded me. 'My innards, my innards, I am shaken!' I am shaken on this day towards the One praised in the great council of the holy ones; I will beseech His presence to forego the rebellion and the guilt: Do not turn to our evil; erase the recorded sin; 'bring us back, Lord, to You and we shall return!'
