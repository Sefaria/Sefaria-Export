Behold, I am wrapping my body with <i>tsitsit</i> (fringes). So too may You wrap my soul – my 248 limbs and my 365 tendons – in the light of the <i>tsitsit</i>, [the letters, strings and knots of] which add up to 613. And in the same way that I cover myself with a prayer shawl in this world, so too may I merit to be in the section of the rabbis and to have a fine prayer shawl in the next world, in the Garden of Eden. And through the commandment of <i>tsitsit</i>, save my essence, my spirit, my soul and my prayer from [negative forces]. And may the prayer shawl spread its wings upon them to save them, ‘like an eagle that rouses his nestlings, hovering over his young.’ And may [this] commandment of <i>tsitsit</i> be considered before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if I fulfilled it in all of its details, all of its minutiae and all of its intentions – [as well as] the 613 commandments that are dependent upon it.

Behold, in placing the <i>tefillin</i> [upon myself], I intend to fulfill the commandment of my Creator, Who commanded us to place <i>tefillin</i>; as it is written in His Torah (Deuteronomy 6:8), “Bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead.” And they are four sections [from the Torah]: Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-8); And it shall be if you will truly listen (Deuteronomy 11:13-21); Sanctify (Exodus 13:1-10); And it shall be when He brings you (Exodus 12:11-17) – since within them they contain His unity and oneness in the world, may His name be blessed; and [through them,] we can remember His miracles and wonders when He took us out of Egypt, and that He has the power and control over the higher beings and the lower beings to do what He wants with them. And He commanded us to place it upon the arm in memory of the ‘extended forearm’ (with which He took us out of Egypt); and that it be across from the heart in order to subjugate the desire and thoughts of our heart for His service, may His name be blessed. And upon the head across from the brain, such that the soul in my brain – along with all my other senses and powers – be subjugated to His service, may His name be blessed. And may the bounty from the commandment of <i>tefillin</i> flow upon me, such that I should have long life, holy bounty, holy thoughts – free from any conjectures of sin or transgression – such that the evil impulse not seduce us or disturb us, but leave us to serve the Lord, as it is in our hearts. And may it be Your will before You, Lord our God and God of our fathers that [this] commandment of <i>tefillin</i> be considered before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if I fulfilled it in all of its details, all of its minutiae and all of its intentions – [as well as] the 613 commandments that are dependent upon it.

                "Elijah the prophet, remembered for his righteousness, did open his mouth and spake, saying, \"O Sovereign of the worlds, Thou who art One and not in count, Thou art the Supreme above all supremes, the Most Hidden of all that is hidden. No thought can apprehend Thee at all. Thou art He who hath emanated ten rectifications (Tikkunim), and they are called the ten emanations (Sefirot), to govern therewith the hidden worlds, which are not revealed, and the revealed worlds, and with them Thou dost conceal Thyself from the sons of men. Thou art He who binds them and unites them; and because Thou art indeed the One, whosoever separates one from another of these ten emanations (Sefirot) is considered as if he had effected separation in Thee. These ten emanations (Sefirot) proceed according to their order: the long (Arikh), the short (Qatzir), the intermediate (Beinoni); and Thou art He who guides them, and there is none that guides Thee, neither above, nor below, nor from any side. Thou hast appointed garments for them, from which souls blossom forth to the sons of men. And how many bodies hast Thou prepared for them, which are called body in respect to the garments that cover them. And these ten emanations (Sefirot) are called by Thy name: loving-kindness (Chesed) of the right arm, might (Gevurah) of the left arm, beauty (Tiferet) of the body, eternity (Netzach) and splendor (Hod) the two legs, foundation (Yesod) the end of the body, sign of the holy covenant, kingdom (Malkhut) the mouth, the oral law that we call it. Wisdom (Chokhmah) of the brain is a thought from Thee, understanding (Binah) of the heart, and in these two it is written, 'The hidden things belong unto the LORD our God.' The supreme crown (Keter Elyon) is the crown of the kingdom, and of it is said, 'Declaring the end from the beginning.' It is the skull where phylacteries lie (Karkafta d'tefillei). From Thee it is Yod 20 and Vav 20, which is the path of emanation, the irrigation of the tree with its branches and boughs, like the water that irrigates the tree, and it grows with that irrigation. O Sovereign of the worlds, Thou art the Cause of causes, and the Reason of reasons, who irrigates the tree with this flow, and this flow is like a soul to the body, and it is life to the body, and in Thee there is no likeness nor image at all, from all that is within and without, and Thou hast created heaven and earth. And from them Thou hast brought forth the sun and the moon and the stars and the constellations, and on earth, trees and grasses, and the Garden of Eden and herbs and living creatures and birds and fish and the sons of men, to make known with them the supremes and how they are conducted with the supremes and the lowers, and how they are known from the supremes and the lowers, and there is no knowledge in Thee at all, and except for Thee there is no unity in the supremes and the lowers, and Thou art known as the Cause of all and the Sovereign over all. And all the emanations (Sefirot), each one has a known name, and they are called angels (Malachim), and Thou hast no known name, for Thou art He who fills all their names, and Thou art the perfection of them all, and when Thou departest from them, all their names remain as a body without a soul. Thou art wise and not with a known wisdom, Thou art understanding and not with a known understanding, Thou hast no known place except to make known Thy power and Thy might to the sons of men, and to show them how Thou conductest the world in justice and in mercy, which are righteousness and judgment, according to the deeds of the sons of men. Judgment is might, judgment is the middle pillar, righteousness is the holy kingdom, the scales of righteousness are two supports of truth, behold righteousness is the sign of the covenant. All this to show how Thou conductest the world, but Thou hast no known righteousness, for it is judgment, nor judgment known, for it is mercy, nor from all these attributes at all. Blessed be the LORD forever, Amen and Amen.\""

Render to them their just deserts; sit [in judgement] to scrutinize [their deeds]. May the sentence of the wicked and corrupt be carried out in full. Those who intend to make us forget Your holy and revered Name and make us familiar with idolatrous names— that are despicable and vulgar; through their methods the best of our people have been destroyed. Spare the remnant from being crushed as [olives] in an oilpress. As they tear beasts of prey, so they learned to devour man, as it is said: they cast lots for us as if we were ownerless property in the wilderness. We were almost utterly consumed, and nothing would have been left of us, were it not for Your mercy, O Master, Who rules with kindness Who dares murmur at Your ways, to argue against them? who dares gird himself to dispute You? We have turned away [from Your mitzvos] and have been scattered like the wind. The enemy’s bloody sword was drawn; but with You is justice and Your hand is uppermost. Let the tyrant not say: “I have prevailed,” nor let Judah’s enemies exult at my fall: Proclaim— for those who were sold for naught— the year of release. May the wicked seeking to extend their rule be turned back and cut down. Your bill of sale preceded theirs and yet the creditors demand payment. To postpone Your lien [is the intent] of the many harsh rulers. The border marks of Your boundary, they seek to uproot. The grain [Israel] which You sanctified, has been devoured— both grain ears and chaff. Let judgement for their evil come on them and reveal their guilt. According to their misdeeds be harsh and bring devastation upon them. For the portion of their cups, rain upon them fiery coals; return to them sevenfold. Avenge Your covenant and destroy them. To the city of Your beautiful Palace, lead us. Make a path through the sea for the redeemed congregation to pass. In You is our hope, and You, our Almighty Creator, comfort us; may Your kindliness be upon us."
