                "O Lord! thou didst wound the head of the first-born, on the night of the Passover. O Omnipotent! yet didst thou pass over thy first-born son, (Israel) being marked with the blood of the sacrifice of the Pass. Not suffering the destroyer to enter my door on the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover.",
                "The strong and fortified city, was surrendered at the time of the Passover. Midian was destroyed by the cake of the barley bread, like the offering of the Omer, on the Passover. The mighty men of Pul and Lud were destroyed with burning conflagration, on the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover. ",
                "The king abode yet in Nob this day, till the time of the Pass. The part of the hand which wrote the destruction of the empire of Babilon, on the Passover. Even at the time when the watch was set and the table prepared, on the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover.",
                "Esther gathered the congregation to fast three days on Pass. The head enemy (Haman) didst thou cause to be executed on the gallows of fifty cubits high, on the Passover. These two things shalt thou bring in a moment on Utz, on the Passover. Thine hand will then be victorious, and thy right hand exalted, as the night when was sanctified the festival of the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover. \n"
