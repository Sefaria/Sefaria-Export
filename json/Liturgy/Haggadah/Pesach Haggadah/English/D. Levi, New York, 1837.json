Thou didst sweep the land of Moph and Noph, when thou didst pass through on the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover. ",
                "O Lord! thou didst wound the head of the first-born, on the night of the observation of the Passover. O Omnipotent! yet didst thou pass over thy first-born son, (Israel) being marked with the blood of the sacrifice of the Passover. Not suffering the destroyer to enter my doors on the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover.",
                "The strong and fortified city, was surrendered at the season of the Passover. Midian was destroyed by the cake of barley bread, like the offering of an omer of barley, on the Passover. The mighty men of Pul and Lud were destroyed with a burning conflagration on the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover. ",
                "The King abode yet in Nob this day, till the time of the Passover. The palm of the hand which wrote the destruction of the foundation of the empire of Babylon, on the Passover. Even at the time when the watch was set, and the table prepared on the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover.",
                "Esther gathered the congregation to fast three days on the Passover. The sworn enemy (Haman) didst thou cause to be executed on a gallows of fifty cubits high, on the Passover. These two things shalt thou bring in a moment on Uts, on the Passover. Thine band will then be victorious, and thy right hand exalted, as on the night where on was sanctified the festival of the Passover. And ye shall say, this is the sacrifice of the Passover. "
