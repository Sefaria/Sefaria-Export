Nothing should stand between you and purity.",
            "<b><i>Karpas</i>:</b> This word is derived from two words: <i>karim,</i> which means pillows and <i>pas, </i>which means remove, as in the verse, “The loyal have vanished (<i>pasu</i>) from among men.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 12:2</i> One who wishes to wear the crown of Torah must first throw away his pillow (his comforts). We learn this in <i>Avot,</i> “This is the way that is becoming for the study of Torah… sleep upon the ground, and live a life of trouble…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pirke Avot 6:4</i> That is, a person should not lie on pillows and couches. The sages also interpreted the word <i>karpas</i> as a reference to <i>samech parekh</i>, sixty (ten thousands) who faced oppression.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When read backwards, the word <i>karpas</i> is made up of the Hebrew letter <i>samekh</i> which is equivalent to the number sixty and the word <i>parekh</i>, oppression. Israel had to be oppressed until there were six hundred thousand men who could stand at Sinai and receive the Torah; only then could they be redeemed. The word, <i>karpas,</i> is an allusion to this number. This notion of six hundred thousand equaling the number of letters in the Torah is common in medieval literature even though the Torah actually possesses considerably fewer letters than this.</i> Sixty x 10,000 is a reference to Israel, since each one of them possesses one of the 600,000 letters that make up Torah.",
            "<b><i>Yachatz</i>:</b> means half or a portion. This is a reference to the continuation of the statement in <i>Pirke</i> <i>Avot</i> mentioned above: “A morsel of bread with salt you shall eat and water by measure you shall drink.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avot 6:4 – “This is the way that is becoming for the study of Torah: a morsel of bread you shall eat and water by measure you shall drink; you shall sleep upon the ground and live a life of trouble while you toil in the Torah. Happy shall you be and it shall be well with you – happy shall you be in this world and it shall be well with you in the world to come.”</i> Or it may be a reference to what the Talmud says: A person shall divide up his study time: a third for Scripture, a third for <i>Mishnah</i> and a third for <i>Gemara</i>. And if he is an entrepreneur, let him divide his time and set fixed times for Torah – this is the meaning of <i>Yachatz</i>, dividing: one should divide his time between study and business. This is a pillar of Torah.",
            "<b><i>Maggid Rach’tzah</i></b>: Before one partakes of a meal, one should study (<i>yagid</i>) and pray and then wash as is the law, reciting the blessing, <i>al n’tilat yadayim </i>before the meal<i></i>. The sages offered the following interpretation of scripture, “You shall not do anything with its blood (<i>hadam</i>):” you shall not eat before you have prayed for your blood (life).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Babylonian Talmud, Berachot 10b and Leviticus 26:19</i> Also they taught, “It is forbidden for a person to taste anything before he has prayed.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT, Kiddushin 10b</i> This is a rebuke to those people who drink coffee on Shabbat and Holiday mornings before attending the synagogue service. Not only is it forbidden before Kiddush but it is forbidden to make Kiddush without its being accompanied by a full meal. Concerning such people we learn: “Rabbi Isaac said in the name of Rabbi Jochanan, who had it from Rabbi Jose, son of Rabbi Hanina in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob: If one eats and drinks and then says his prayers, of him the Scripture says, ‘And you have cast me behind your back.’ Read not gavekha [your back], but gei’ekha [your pride]. Says the Holy One: After this one has exalted himself, he comes and accepts the kingdom of heaven!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Kiddushin 10b also see 1 Kings 14:9</i> Where is the reverence of one who enters synagogue to pray with a full stomach? The Ari, Rabbi Isaac Luria, emphasized this law greatly and even said that it was forbidden to eat before sunrise.",
            "<b><i>Motzi Matzah</i></b>: A person should remove (<i>motzi</i>) controversy (<i>matzah)</i> from his heart. This is particularly true during meal times as we learn in the Talmud: “Elijah once said to Rabbi Nathan: Eat a third and drink a third and leave a third in case you get angry, and then you will have had your fill.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Gittin 70a</i> Righteous people who don’t lose their temper, however, are permitted to eat until they are full since they don’t get angry. This is the meaning of Scripture: “The righteous person can eat to his heart’s content but the belly of the wicked is empty,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 13:25</i> and, “They were fools who suffered for their sinful ways and for their iniquities, all food was loathsome to them; they reached the gates of death.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 107:17-18</i> One should leave one’s stomach one third empty since eating too much and then becoming angry upsets the stomach. It is, therefore, fitting to stay away from conflict when one eats, and there is no utensil more precious than peace.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Uktzin 3:12</i>",
            "<b><i>Maror Korekh</i></b>: Even if some disagreement or bitterness burns in his heart, let him ‘wrap up’ (<i>hikhrikh</i>) any hurts with love and let him judge all people favorably, as we learn in <i>Masekhet Shabbat</i>: “Our Rabbis taught: He who judges his neighbor in the scale of merit is himself judged favorably,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Shabbat 127b</i> and elsewhere in the Talmud. The sages of blessed memory also quote the following verse: “Better to be forbearing than mighty; to have self control than to conquer a city.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 16:32</i> There are those who remain calm even when their body is aching, a fire is burning in them and bitterness is dripping within them – such people are subject to terrible diseases. Others, however, remain completely calm and do not allow their hearts to become angry. This is a great quality – greater than conquering a city. The body is called a city as Ecclesiastes said: “Better a poor youth than an old but foolish king who no longer has the sense to heed warnings.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 4:13</i> This is a pillar of worship; and now I will speak about acts of kindness.",
            "<b><i>Shulchan Arukh</i></b>: One’s house should be wide open and the needy should be guests in one’s household, especially when one says, ‘all who are hungry come and eat.” Those who enter one’s house hungry should leave satiated as we find in the case of Yoav who called his house a <i>midbar</i>, a wilderness; that is, like a wilderness it is open to all and free to anyone who wants to enter it and join in the meal without an invitation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Shanhedrin 49a; also See 2 Samuel II 20:10. And he (Joab) was buried in his own house in the wilderness. But was his house a wilderness? Rab Judah said in Rab's name: It was like a wilderness, just as a wilderness is free to all, so was Joab's house free to all. Alternatively: ‘Like a wilderness’ means, just as a wilderness is free from robbery and licentiousness, so was Joab's house free from robbery and licentiousness.</i> Great is one who quenches the thirst of a guest – such a person merits having the divine presence dwell in his midst. We learn this in Sanhedrin 104a, where we learn that a false prophet was given a portion in the world to come because he offered hospitality to Iddo the prophet.",
            "<b><i>Tzafun Barekh</i></b>: A person should walk humbly and give charity secretly, since,” Giving gifts secretly assuages anger.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 21:14</i> What’s more, even if he is hard pressed he should do so and should not let his reverence for God leave him since his portion is hidden (<i>tzafun</i>) and is not given in this world. He should loan to a needy person in his hour of need, even though times are tough for the lender himself. He should not refrain from lending – it is as if he is bringing an offering to God. We learn this from an abbreviation: <i>Milvad olat haboker</i>, ‘You shall present these in addition to the morning offerings.” The word <i>milvad</i> stands for, <b><i>M</i></b><i>ilaveh <b>L</b>e-ani <b>B</b>’sha’at <b>D</b>ochako</i>, lend to the poor person in the hour of need.",
            "<b><i>Hallel Nirtzah</i></b>: When one performs good deeds, his praise will be accepted and praise will be recited for him, as is written in scripture: “The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord; there shall be good sense to all who perform them. Praise of him shall be everlasting.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 111:10 Understood midrashically, the expression Praise of him is applied to the one who performs good deeds and not to God.</i> Anyone whose fear of sin is greater than his wisdom, his wisdom shall endure – and ‘there shall be good sense to all who perform them.’ As long as his praise lasts, his wisdom shall last."

                "<b>Why Four Cups of Wine</b>: On page 72b of <i>Pesachim, </i>Rashi writes that we drink four cups of wine is for the four expressions of redemption: “I will bring you out,” “I will save you,” “I will redeem you,” and “I will bring you to the land.” Elsewhere,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Pesachim 108a</i> Rashi writes that the reason for the four cups of wine is reminiscent of the three cups of wine which Pharaoh’s wine bearer saw in his dream as well as the cup which we drink after the <i>Birkat HaMazon</i>, the Grace after Meals. It seems to me that there is another reason for the four cups of wine found in the <i>Mekhilta, Parshat Bo</i>. According to Rabbi Elazar Hakafar, the four cups of wine are related to the four mitzvot which the people of Israel performed and that the world are not worthy of: the people of Israel were not guilty of unchastity , they didn’t commit slander, and they didn’t change their names, their language, nor their clothing to follow their neighbors. It was because of these actions that they merited redemption from Egypt. In the <i>Mekhlita</i> scriptural verses are brought as proof texts for each of these actions. It was in honor of these actions that we drink the four cups of wine. <br>However, this is difficult. We say “You were naked and barren of <i>mitzvot</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse from Ezekiel is quoted later in the Haggadah.</i> which suggests that the Israelites did not have any <i>mitzvot</i> to their credit to make them worthy of redemption, and therefore God gave them the blood of circumcision and the blood of the Passover offering. The K’li Yakar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Lunschitz 1550 – 3 March 1619) was a rabbi, poet and Torah commentator, best known for his Torah commentary <i>K’li Yakar</i>.</i> answers this question that these four <i>mitzvot </i>were all passive acts – they didn’t involve performing an act. The Israelites did not have any active commandments to their credit. Therefore God gave them two commandments which involved performing an action rather than simply desisting from doing something. The Holy one freed them from bondage as a reward for the four commandments but did not take them out of Egypt. Israel ceased serving the Egyptians in the month of Tishri but they did not leave Egypt until the month of Nisan after they had circumcised all the males and offered the Passover sacrifice."

                "<b><i>Kadesh Asher bachar banu</i></b>: As with many blessings, the Kiddush begins “Praised are You…” (in the second person) but continues “That he chose us…” (in the third person). Ramban makes the following comment in <i>Parshat B’shalach</i> on Exodus 15:26:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Give ear to His commandments and heed His laws and I will not bring upon you any of the diseases that I brought upon the Egyptians, for I the Lord am your healer.” This verse begins in the third person and then switches to the second person, just like the formula. Ramban comments on this and other verses which contain this switch of person – they are the basis for the Kiddush formula.</i><br>“<i>Any berakhah </i>which acknowledges God’s sovereignty,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, it begins with the word <i>Baruch attah Adonai</i>…</i> continues in the third person (for example, <i>asher kidshanu</i> – ‘Who sanctifies us’) while blesses that do not begin with the divine name because they fellow another blessing, are written in the second person,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are three formulas for blessings: Short blessings which begin <i>baruch attah Adonai</i>; Long blessings which begin and end with the words <i>baruch attah Adonai</i>; and connected blessings which follow either a short or long blessing. They do not begin with the words <i>baruch attah Adonai</i> but end with these words. Ramban suggests here that the language and person of the blessing depends on the type of blessing we are reciting.</i> such as the second blessing of the <i>Amidah</i> which begins <i>attah gibor</i>, ‘You are mighty.’ Similarly the sages decreed that the <i>Alaynu</i> should be written in the third person because it begins by acknowledging God’s sovereignty.” <br>This explanation is problematic since the blessing over the wine which we recite later in the <i>Haggadah, Asher g’alanu</i> as well as the prayer we add to the <i>Amida</i> during the Ten Days of Repentance, <i>Zochreinu</i>, begins in the third person and then switches to the second person, contradicting the Ramban.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Haggadah we say, “Who redeemed us and our ancestors….so too did Adonai our God, bring us to the other festivals and seasons. In the Amida we say, “Remember us for life, O King who delights in life…” In the first blessing of the Amida then we switch to the second person from the third person.</i> The Ramban believed that the first part of the blessing must be in the third person but not the latter part of the blessing. The last part of a blessing which is written in the form of a petition can be written in the second person. This matter needs more study."

                "<b>Women and Kiddush</b>: Although it is the custom of women to recite the <i>She’heche’yanu </i>when they light the holiday candles, I have not been able to find a basis for this among any of the early or later decisors of Jewish law. I wrote to my father regarding this matter and he has answered me that others have expressed surprise about this matter as well. Actually, the <i>She’heche’yanu</i> should be recited over the first cup of wine. Still my father has written that we should allow women this practice since it gives them pleasure. Also we learn in the <i>Talmud</i> that the <i>She’heche’yanu</i> can be recited anywhere, even in the market place. I wrote back to my father about this matter I and added that if a woman has already said the <i>She’heche’yanu</i> when she lit the candles, she should not say it again if she is the one reciting the <i>Kiddush</i>. If a man is the one lighting the candles then it is better for him to wait and recite the <i>She’heche’yanu</i> when he says the <i>Kiddush</i> and not when he lights the candles.

Since we are supposed to eat less than an olive’s worth, and the washing is less than the required amount it is not necessary except for the head of the household who touches all the greens which are dipped. Therefore, it is appropriate for the person who hands out the greens to all those around the table to wash first and then to pass out the portions to each person."

                    "<b><i>Ha lachma anya</i></b>: There are a number of difficulties in this passage. First, the passage should have begun with the words, “All who are hungry come and eat.” Second, it would have been more appropriate to say, “This is the bread of affliction” when everyone is sitting around the table paying attention. There are other issues which Don Isaac Abarbanel and the <i>Ma’aseh Adonai </i>spell out.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaac Abarbanel was one of the leading scholars in Spain at the time of the expulsion of the Jews in 1492. His commentary on the Haggadah is called <i>Zevach Pesach</i>. It begins with a hundred questions which Abarbanel then answers. <i>Ma’aseh Adonai</i> is yet another well known commentary on the Haggadah, this one by Rabbi Eliezer Ashkenazi (1512-1585).</i> <br>In Yoreh Deah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yoreh Deah</i> is one of the four sections of the <i>Shulchan Arukh</i>, the great compendium of Jewish law by Joseph Karo.</i> 249:3 we learn that when giving tzedakah, one should do so with a cheerful countenance, joyfully and with a full heart. One should empathize with the needy person in his misery and speak to him with consolation. If one greets him with an angry countenance then he loses all merit for the mitzvah of giving tzedakah even if he gives him money or food. This is what the prophet Isaiah wrote: “and you offer your compassion to the hungry and satisfy the famished creature.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 58:10</i> This means that one should first speak to the needy person and ask him about his troubles. One should not humiliate him since the world is a turning wheel – the needy person who sits on the dung heap may eventually sit with princes. He should placate the poor person and encourage him to come to his house. But once the meal begins, he should not speak about the other’s poverty; rather he should treat him as if he were the host’s best friend and happy to be with him. They should eat and drink happily together. When the poor guest prepares to leave, once again his host should console him with soft words and tell him that God will help him and that he will see better times just as we all wait for the final redemption.<br>These are the things that the host should do who invites the needy to join him at the <i>Seder.</i> First, he should say, “This is the bread of affliction which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt.” By saying “In Egypt,” instead of saying, “When we went forth from Egypt.” David Abudraham<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Fourteenth Century Scholar from Spain best known for his compendium of prayers and synagogue rituals.</i> relates that when his contemporary was imprisoned in India they fed him unleavened bread that did not get moldy or stale. One can go on to explain that the Egyptians did not allow the Israelites to bake regular bread in Egypt – but eventually the unleavened bread became a symbol of freedom. In this way, one can remove the mask of humiliation from the poor person’s face. He does not have to feel he has come to a rich person’s house this night – we all eat the bread of poverty and affliction. Rather we should make the person feel at home and accepted by saying: “All who are in need come and celebrate the Pesach.” He does not have to feel that he is eating the bread of humiliation. And when he prepares to leave, speaking consolingly to him and say, “This year we are here – next year in the land of Israel!” That is, he can anticipate God’s redemption land of Israel just as we do.",
                    "<b>Ha Lachma Anya, A Second Interpretation: </b>The Midrash teaches that it is through the merit of giving tzedakah that our ancestors were redeemed from Egypt. They would feed the hungry at their tables and from them we can learn how to act. Just as they fed the needy, so we should feed the needy. In <i>Masekhet Baba Batra</i>, 10a, we learn “<i>Tzedakah</i> is great for it brings redemption closer.” We learn this lesson from Isaiah 56:1 – “Soon my salvation shall come for my righteousness (<i>tzedakah</i>) shall be revealed.” This is the first lesson of the <i>Haggadah</i> in the words, “This is the bread of affliction.” The redemption was because of the bread of the needy which our ancestors fed them in Egypt; therefore, lets us act similar to them. We say, “All who are hungry come and eat.” What is the reason for this, so that while “now we are here,” next year “we may be in the land of Israel.” It is through acts of tzedakah that we bring redemption closer and that we can anticipate being in the land of Israel in the year to come!",
                    "<b>Ha Lachma Anya, A Third Interpretation: </b>In looking closely at the language of this passage, the question is raised why is it in Aramaic? The common answer, that the people in Babylonian spoke Aramaic is not a sufficient answer to this question. For in our time when we understand Hebrew we should recite this passage in Hebrew. I found written on a manuscript containing the words of the liturgy from the year 1406, “Why do we recite this passage in Aramaic? Because the evil spirits do not understand this language, and if we recited this passage in a language that the spirits understood they would come and harm the people. <br>Yet don’t we refer to Passover as a <i>leil shemurim</i>, a night of guarding, so what do we have to fear on the eve of Passover?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Pesachim 109b; See Exodus 12:42; The <i>Talmud</i> says “Said Rabbi Nahman: Scripture said, [it is] a night of guarding [unto the lord]: [i.e.,] it is a night that is guarded for all time from harmful spirits.</i> While the evil spirits cannot come on their own and harm people, if we issue an invitation, they are given an opening to come and cause damage. Also by issuing an invitation they will become habituated to being present and can cause harm to the members of the household after the Passover is over. This idea that it is a night of guarding from harmful spirits is difficult, since elsewhere we say that it is only on Yom Kippur that we are protected from the harmful spirits. The word <i>Ha-satan</i> has the numerical value of 364 because 364 days a year harmful spirits can attack us but not on Yom Kippur – the 365th day of the year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Nedarim 32a</i> This implies that on the days of Passover, harmful spirits do have the ability to attack and harm people. The answer to this question is that on Passover the Jewish people are protected from harmful spirits but not the other nations of the world. On Yom Kippur, the entire world is protected from harmful spirits which is what we are referring to in the word <i>Ha-satan</i>. <br>But there are other difficulties with this idea. In the book of Job we say, “On the day when the divine beings presented themselves before the Lord, the adversary, <i>Ha-satan</i>, came along and to present himself before the Lord…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 2:1</i> The Aramaic translation of the Bible translates “on the day” as “the day of the great fast” implying that even on Yom Kippur evil spirits could cause harm to the other nations. (So what then is the distinction between Yom Kippur and Passover with regard to protection from harmful spirits?) On Passover the Jewish people are protected from the actions but not (from?) the words of the harmful spirits (i.e., they could not harm us but they could curse us) but on Yom Kippur the harmful spirits cannot harm us in word nor in deed. Therefore on Passover we recite the invitation to the Seder in Aramaic so that the harmful spirits cannot find entrance to our homes even in word. Only Israel and not the other nations are protected on these two occasions.<br>Yet why is this passage recited partly in Aramaic and partly in Hebrew<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ha lachma Anya</i> – Aramaic; Kol Dikhfin yetei –Aramaic; <i>Hashta hakha, Hashta Avdei</i> – Aramaic; <i>Lishanah Habbah, Benei Horin</i> – Hebrew</i>? This passage refers to four different time periods in the history of the Jews of Babylonia. The first passage, “this is the bread of affliction” refers to the first Passover soon after they arrived in Babylonia. The second passage was added after the rebuilding of the temple, “All who are hungry come and eat” and “All who are needy come celebrate the Passover.” The people felt like royalty and joyously celebrated even in Babylonia. They opened their homes in great joy and generosity to celebrate this occasion. When the Temple was destroyed again, the sense of joy ceased and now the people said, “Now we are here next year may we be in the Land of Israel.” The references to the redemption were made in Hebrew while the references to the exile were made in Aramaic, <i>hashta hakha</i>, “Now we are here.” Yet in this third passage we find a combination of Hebrew and Aramaic <i>b’ara d’yisrael</i>. This was a way of saying that even though the Jewish people will eventually be able to return to the land of Israel, they are still not completely free since we are subjugated to the Persians and the Medes, and others. Only in the final passage which is a reference to the fourth exile, do we switch over to Hebrew completely in the final part of this expression, “Now we are slaves (in Aramaic) but next year may we be free (in Hebrew).” We say <i>Lishana ha-baah b’nei horin</i>, “Next year may we be free”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus, the end of this final or fourth exile will lead to the complete redemption of the Jewish people and not a partial redemption like the earlier ones.</i> which is entirely Hebrew.",
                    "<b><i>Ha Lachma Anya</i>, A Fourth Interpretation</b>: This passage is an explanation of <i>Yachatz,</i> the custom of breaking the middle <i>matzah</i> in half. “This is the bread affliction” explains why we put a broken piece of <i>matzah</i> back on the <i>Seder </i>plate between the other two pieces of <i>matzah</i>. It is a symbol of slavery. The poor person saves a bit of food because he is never sure where his next meal will come from. So, too, we place a broken piece of matzah back with the others as a reminder of slavery. The second piece is wrapped up and put behind the pillow as a reminder of the unleavened bread which our ancestors made while hastily fleeing from Egypt. We can now understand why we refer to this holiday as <i>Hag HaMatzot</i>, the festival of the unleavened breads, in the plural, and not <i>Hag HaMatzah</i>, in the singular as we say about the Passover offering, <i>Hag HaPesach</i>. The Pesach is offered only once, on the first day so we refer to it in the singular. We eat <i>matzah</i> for seven/eight days, and it has at least two different meanings. It is a reminder of slavery and a reminder of the Exodus.<br>There is second explanation for <i>Yachatz </i>in this opening statement of the <i>Haggadah</i>. We break the <i>matzah</i> in half so that we can recite the blessing for eating over <i>matzah</i> over half of it and use the other half for the Afikomen, which reminds us of the Pesach offering. We make reference to these two meanings of the broken <i>matzah</i> in <i>Ha lachma anya</i>. “This is the bread of affliction” refers to the <i>matzah</i>, and “all who are needy, come celebrate the Pesach” is a reference to Pesach offering.<br>A third explanation of <i>Yachatz</i> can be found in <i>Ha lachma anya</i>: it symbolizes exile and redemption. Part of the <i>matzah </i>symbolizes the bitter exile of the people of Israel; we refer to this in the expressions, “Now we are here” and “Now we are slaves.” The other half of the <i>matzah</i> is a symbol of the future redemption. The word <i>afikomen</i> comes from the Aramaic “to go forth;” we will go forth from exile to “the land of Israel” and we will go forth from slavery to “freedom.” Since the time of redemption is hidden from us, we hide the <i>afikomen </i>behind a pillow; it is a source of our hope and trust during this period of exile.",
                    "<b><i>Ha Lachma Anya</i>, A Fifth Interpretation:</b> We learn that one should not eat on the eve of Pesach until after dark. The reason for this law is that our ancestors in Egypt could not eat until they returned from a long day of slavery in the fields. The task masters made them work hard all day we commemorate their experience by reenacting it on Passover eve. We wait until dark to eat our meal on the eve of Passover and begin by saying, <i>Ha lachma anya, </i>“this is the bread of affliction” so that we are truly like a servant returning from the fields to eat one’s evening meal.<br>Similarly, the Jerusalem Talmud says, that one who eats <i>matzah </i>on Passover eve is like one who has intimate relations with his fiancé in his father-in-law’s house before the marriage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jerusalem Talmud (JT) Pesachim 10:1</i>. A bride is forbidden to the groom prior to the <i>sheva berachot, </i>the seven marriage blessings. Similarly before we eat <i>matzah </i>at the <i>Seder</i>, we must recite seven blessing as the groom does for his bride:<br>1. Wine<br>2. <i>Kiddush </i><br>3. <i>Sh’hecheyanu</i><br>4.  <i>Karpas</i><br>5. <i>Asher G’alanu</i><br>6. Wine<br>7. <i>Netilat Yadaim</i><br>8. <i>Matzah</i><br>9. <i>Hamotzi</i><br>There are actually nine blessings leading up to the <i>matzah</i> so which ones do we count? According to Abudraham, the two blessings for the wine aren’t included in the seven blessings. The author suggests that we don’t include the <i>motzi</i> or the blessing for washing the hands since one recite those blessings even if it wasn’t Passover. Actually, the Jerusalem Talmud teaches us that the significance of the ceremonies is not in the number of blessings we say but in the connection between the wedding ceremony and the <i>Seder</i>. Just as one needs <i>Kiddushin</i> ceremony (the betrothal ceremony), the canopy (the <i>Nisuin</i> blessings), the reading of the <i>ketubah, </i>and two cups of wine for a wedding ceremony to be complete<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are two parts to a Jewish wedding ceremony; each part is recited over a separate cup of wine under the <i>chuppah.</i> The <i>kiddushin </i>or <i>erusin </i>ceremony is referred to as the betrothal ceremony. The <i>Nisuin</i> ceremony is made up of seven blessings and is usually referred to as the <i>Sheva Berachot</i>.</i> so, too, before we eat the <i>matzah</i> must recite the <i>Kiddush</i> (the <i>Erusin), </i>cover the <i>matzah</i> (the <i>chuppah</i>), read the <i>Haggadah</i> (reading of the <i>ketubah), </i>drink two cups of wine before the meal (just as we drink two cups of wine in the wedding ceremony), and partaking of the meal is compared to the consummation of the relationship, as we read in scripture: Such is the way of the adulteress, she eats, wipes her mouth and says, ‘I have done no wrong.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 30:20; this is a strange biblical citation but the connection is clear. Eating is a metaphor for sexual relations in this verse and in his comparison of the wedding ceremony and the Seder meal.</i><br><b>All who are in need… </b>of the basic necessities of the Seder which are the four cups of wine and the Pesach offering ‘let him come and celebrate Passover/<i>Pesach</i>.” The <i>afikomen</i> is a symbol of the <i>Pesach</i> offering. (That is, the first statement “all who are hungry…come and eat” is a reference to the matzah, while the second statement “all who are in need” is a reference to the Afikomen/the sacrifice and the four cups of wine. They also symbolize the future hope of redemption when we will be able to celebrate Passover fully once again. That is why we continue, “Now we are here, next year may we be in the land of Israel.”",
                    "<b><i>Ha Lachma Anya</i>, A Sixth Interpretation</b>: This passage is an expression of the four children. “This is the bread of affliction,” is a reference to the wise child. <i>Matzah </i>has two opposite meanings – it is the food which our ancestors ate in Egypt because it didn’t spoil as well as the dough which they brought out of Egypt. Only a wise child will be able to see both meanings of <i>matzah</i>.<br>“All who are hungry come and eat; all who are in need come celebrate Passover” is a reference to the wicked child. Only those who starved themselves on the eve of Passover and have gone to great bother in preparing for the Seder should come and eat now. The wicked child who says, “What is the meaning of this service,” doesn’t deserve to partake of the Seder meal!<br>“Now we are here, next year in the land of Israel,” is addressed to the simple child. He is amazed at all the trouble we have made in preparing for the <i>Seder</i>. After all, aren’t we still living in a bitter exile? Aren’t we still subjugated to other rulers living in a land other than our own? We answer him, we are living here but next year we may yet be in the land of Israel for we still express hope every day in our redemption.<br>“Now we are slaves; next year may we be free” is a statement that refers to the child who doesn’t know how to ask. He has heard the explanation of the father to the simple child but it does not satisfy him. His mind begins to wander and he becomes more depressed. The father cannot answer this child as he was able to do with the simple child. He has not yet learned to distinguish between one land and another; therefore the father says to him, “Next year we will be free like kings and princes!” This is a distinction that this child can understand.",
                    "<b><i>Ha Lachma Anya</i>, A Seventh Interpretation</b>: The leader of the Seder makes this statement in order to encourage all who are present to ask the four questions. The first statement, “This is the bread affliction,” will make him ask about <i>matzah</i>. When we lift the <i>Seder</i> plate and say all who are hungry, showing the things we dip, the <i>maror </i>and the <i>karpas</i> – he will ask the second and third questions – about <i>maror</i> and dipping. And when he says, ‘now we are here’ and ‘now we are slaves,’ the child will ask regarding the practice of leaning which the father has already mentioned when we recited the <i>Kiddush</i>. The child may wonder, if we are still in exile and are still slaves why do we bother leaning on this night. Thus, by reciting <i>Ha lachma anya</i>, the leader of the Seder will encourage the children to recite the <i>Mah Nishtanah</i>, the four questions."

                    "<b><i>Mah Nishtanah</i></b>: Why does this passage begin with <i>mah</i> (How is this night different) and not <i>lama</i> (Why is this night different)? In a number of places, the word <i>lama</i> implies a negative response, as in, “Why (<i>lama</i>) should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that God delivered them from Egypt,’”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 32:12</i> “Why did you bring harm upon this people,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 5:22</i> and, “Why should the nations say.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 115:2</i> In each of these cases, the question implies a rhetorical question to which there is a negative answer. The word <i>mah</i> on the other hand implies that the question wants an explanation for the practice. Even though the wicked child’s question begins with the word <i>mah</i>, his question still has a negative implication. First, he wants to know the reason for the rituals but his question implies that even if he knows the reason, he is not going to perform this act. He asks, “What does this service mean to YOU,” and not to HIM.<br>Three of the four children begin their question with the word, <i>mah</i>: “What are these statutes,” “What is the reason for this service,” and “What is this.” Therefore, the author of the <i>Haggadah</i> begins the four questions with the word <i>mah</i> as well. The opening words of <i>Mah Nishtanah</i> are an allusion (<i>remez</i>) to the story of Esther. “On that night, sleep deserted the king…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 6:1</i> This took place on the night of Passover – it inaugurated the downfall of Haman. The first letters of <i>Mah nishtanah halailah</i> spell the name Haman, a reminder that this is a night of redemption in many generations. <br>According to the ways of esoteric interpretation (<i>sod</i>), the word <i>mah</i> is a reference to the <i>sephirah</i> of Divine Wisdom <i>(chokhmah)</i>. The word <i>chokhmah</i>, comes from the words <i>koach mah</i> – the potential for <i>mah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are ten Sephirot or divine manifestations in classical Kabbalah: <i>Keter, Chochmah, Bina, Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Hod, Hadar, Yesod, Malchut or Shechinah</i>. Each of these different manifestations of God has a variety of different symbols and words which are outer manifestations of the inner life of God. Chokhmah, or divine wisdom is associated with the word mah. Rabbi Moshe Miller writes: “The Zohar breaks up the word <i>chochma</i> into two words: \"<i>koach</i>\" and \"<i>mah</i>\". \"<i>Koach</i>\" means \"potential\", and \"<i>mah</i>\" means \"what is\". Thus <i>chochma</i> means \"the potential of what is\", or \"the potential to be\". This aspect of <i>chochma</i> describes the state of <i>chochma</i> in relation to the <i>sefira</i> of <i>keter</i>. As <i>chochma</i> emanates from <i>keter</i>, it \"appears\" in an obscure and undefined state. It is only potential being. It is virtually non-being. Thus the verse states, \"and <i>chochma</i> emerges from nothingness\" (Job 28:12). In other words, it is in a state of constant flux between being and non-being - between revelation, the first point of immanent being, and non-revelation as it returns to its state of potential and merges in its source, <i>keter</i>. <i>Chochma</i> flashes in and out of existence. The Infinite Light thus becomes unified in the world of <i>Atzilut</i> through clothing itself first in the <i>sefira</i> of <i>chochma</i>.” The wise child then is connected to the attribute of divine wisdom.</i> It is also connected to the <i>Sephirah </i>of <i>Malchut</i>; this night is a night of <i>mah, Malchut</i>.",
                    "<b>We can eat either leavened bread or unleavened bread</b>: Why don’t we ask the same type of question regarding maror: “On all other nights we can eat either regular vegetables or bitter herbs…” The question is phrased differently for <i>chametz</i> and <i>matzah</i> in order to emphasize that not only don’t we eat <i>chametz</i> on this night but we can’t even eat enriched matzah such as egg <i>matzah</i>. On the eve of Passover we only eat <i>lechem oni</i>, the bread of the poor which is regular <i>matzah</i>. We therefore say, tonight we eat <i>kulo matzah</i>, only <i>matzah. Maror</i> is different since this <i>mitzvah</i> can be fulfilled with all different types of vegetables and herbs, as long as they taste bitter. We don’t have to say <i>kulo maror</i> - only bitter herbs - as we say <i>kulo matzah</i> – only <i>matzah</i>.",
                    "<b><i>Mah Nishtanah</i></b>: There are many questions raised by this passage. First, why don’t we ask about the other things which are different on this night, such as the four cups of wine? The fact that the children aren’t yet aware that there are other cups of wine is not an answer to this question; they also don’t know that we are going to dip twice during the <i>Seder</i>. All they really know about are the things that are found on the <i>Seder </i>plate. The Talmud says that we recite the <i>Mah Nishtanah</i> when we pour the second cup of wine. If that is so, then the child should have asked, “Why are we pouring a second cup of wine?” It seems that the questions are related to eating the Passover meal. We ask them when we pour the second cup of wine because drinking the wine increases one’s appetite and one’s desire for <i>matzah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Pesachim 107b</i>. When the child sees the pouring of the wine, he begins to wonder about this meal and how different it is.<br>There are other questions. We ask the four questions in their proper order!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In point of fact, first we lean, then we dip, then we eat matzah and then we eat the bitter herbs.</i> In the Zevach Pesach commentary, Rabbi Isaac Abarbanel writes that the first two questions relate to slavery and the second two questions, freedom. We have two questions regarding slavery (<i>matzah</i> and bitter herbs) because there were two aspects of slavery in Egypt. We were enslaved both to Pharaoh and the people of Egypt. Not only did we have to serve Pharaoh, but we could not escape from Egypt and had to serve all the people of the land. But if these two questions both relate to slavery a wise child could have combined these questions: “Why on all other nights we can eat <i>chametz </i>or <i>matzah </i>as well as all types of vegetables but tonight, we eat only <i>matzah</i> and bitter herbs?” Similarly with the second two questions which relate to freedom, he could have said, “tonight we recline and dip twice unlike other nights.”<br>Rabbi Eliezer Ashkenazi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Eliezer (Lazer) ben Elijah Ashkenazi</b> (1512–December 13, 1585) was a Talmudist, rabbi, and physician. Though of a German family (according to some, the relative of Joseph Colon, he was probably born in the Levant, and received his Talmudic education under Joseph Taitazak in Salonica. Ashkenazi first became rabbi in Egypt 1538-60, probably at Fostat, where, by his learning and wealth, he became widely known.</i>, in his commentary Ma’aseh Adonai, writes that the four questions are related to the four children. The question regarding <i>matzah</i> is the question of the wise child. He wants to know why this night is ‘entirely’ <i>matzah</i>; with most of the laws of kashrut a small amount can be disregarded but not so with <i>chametz </i>and <i>matzah</i>. Even a little <i>chametz</i> is forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a concept in <i>kashrut </i>referred to as <i>batel bishishim</i>; that if the amount of <i>treif </i>that falls into kosher food is one sixtieth (or less), the kashrut is still intact. Not so with <i>hametz</i>. Even a tiny bit of something <i>hametz </i>makes the food forbidden. So tonight must be entirely matzah.</i> Also the matzah which we eat on this night must be plain <i>matzah</i>, uncooked other than its being baked. It must also be the last thing we eat so that its taste remains in our mouth. <br>The second question regarding bitter herbs is the wicked child’s question. He has no desire for something bitter so he says, “What is this service to you?”<br>The simple child asks the third question regarding dipping twice. He only asks about that which he sees. He sees that we are going to dip twice and wonders, “What is this?”<br>Finally, the ‘one who doesn’t know how to ask’ on his own, questions the act of leaning. We purposely lean during the Seder, something we don’t ordinarily do, in order to provoke this child to ask questions.<br>There are two other ways of interpreting this passage in the <i>Haggadah</i>.<br><b>First Explanation</b>: To explain the first interpretation, we must first understand the connection between Passover and <i>Pesach Sheni</i>, the Second Passover.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesach Sheni, <i>Second Passover</i>, is a minor Jewish observance on the 14th of Iyar in the Hebrew Calendar. The holiday is mentioned in the Torah in Numbers 9:1-14 of which the following text is a paraphrase.</i> There are two verses in scripture which contain a significant difference. “They shall eat it roasted over fire and matzah with bitter herbs.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:8</i> In Parshat Baha’lotkha, “According to all the statutes of Passover, you shall eat it with <i>matzah</i> and bitter herbs.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 9:12</i> Note the difference between these two verses. In the first one, regarding Passover, there is a separation between the <i>matzah </i>and bitter herbs<i>, </i>while the verse from Numbers which is related to the Second Passover, the Passover offering is separate from <i>matzah</i> and bitter herbs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word “with” appears after the word matzah in the first verse and before the word matzah in the second verse, suggesting that the role of matzah was different on the Second Passover from than on the first. The Bible tells us that those who could not celebrate the first Passover for reasons beyond their control can celebrate a ‘second Passover’ one month later.</i> Nachmanides explains that the first verse suggests that both the Passover offering and the <i>matzah</i> are each a unique and separate <i>mitzvah</i> on the eve of Passover. They are connected by the Hebrew letter, <i>vav </i>(and), which is a conjunction. This teaches us that that these two commandments are not dependent on one another while the eating of bitter herbs is dependent on the Passover offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, if there is no offering we are not obligated to eat bitter herbs. But we are still obligated to eat matzah. Eating bitter herbs, then, is a rabbinic and not a scriptural commandment at our <i>Seder </i>today.</i> That is why we see ‘<i>al marorim</i>,’ with bitter herbs, and not <i>u’marorim</i>, ‘and bitter herbs,’ in the first verse.<br>Someone who didn’t observe the Passover on the fifteenth of Nissan because of circumstances beyond his control can make it up one month later on the fifteenth of Iyyar. If one forgot to eat <i>matzah</i> on the fifteenth of Nissan (in our time), he cannot make it up this lost <i>mitzvah.</i> Even if the person eats <i>matzah</i> on the fifteenth of Iyyar he has not fulfilled this <i>mitzvah</i>. The Second Passover is only for making up the missed sacrifice in ancient times. He still must eat the Passover offering with matzah and bitter herbs, but this does not count for the missed commandment of eating <i>matzah</i> on <i>Passover</i>. The verse in Numbers, therefore, says, “You shall eat it <i>WITH </i>matzah and bitter herbs;” the word WITH implies that while you still eat these other foods they are not considered separate <i>mitzvot.</i><br>We can now understand the statements in the <i>Mah Nishtanah</i>. These four questions are all related to the similarities and differences between the regular Passover and the Second Passover. That we do all these things to commemorate the Exodus is obvious to the reader. So why are they different from one another? The question is, “Why is this night so different from all other nights – even from the Second Passover?” <br>On the Second Passover why don’t we have two commandments of <i>matzah </i>and the Passover offering just as we have on the first Passover, since scripture states, “According to all the laws of Passover you shall do it.” Regarding the second question, we ask, ‘If bitter herbs are only an accoutrement and not a separate <i>mitzvah</i> on Passover why do we eat bitter herbs at this time?’ Similarly, we ask regarding the dipping and the leaning, shouldn’t we be required to lean and dip on the Second Passover just as we do on the first Passover? Only those acts which accompany the Passover offering are prevented on the Second Passover and not the other customs.<br>The answer to all these questions is that the first Passover is a commemoration of the Exodus from Egypt and therefore all of these practices are required as part of the celebration while the purpose of the Second Passover is to allow the person to make up for the missed sacrifice and not to commemorate the Exodus all over again. We eat unleavened bread to remind ourselves that our dough did not have time to become leavened when we left Egypt and that the matzah was the bread of affliction, a reminder of slavery. Today we eat the bitter herbs to remind ourselves of our ancestors’ bitterness in Egypt. The dipping and leaning are a commemoration of the verse, “I brought you out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.” All of this only applies on the night of the fifteenth of Nissan. The Second Passover offering was not a reminder of the miracles but a ‘make-up date’ for the missed offering.",
                    "<b>Second Explanation</b>: The second explanation of <i>Mah Nishtanah</i> is related to Rabban Gamliel’s statement later in the Haggadah in which he explains why we eat the Passover offering, the <i>matzah</i> and the bitter herbs. Clearly, the reason for <i>matzah</i> is to commemorate freedom while the reason for the bitter herbs is to remind us of slavery. We eat them together with the Passover offering (according to Hillel), to include all of these remembrances together. But why do we explain them out of order? The bitter herbs should have been explained first in Rabban Gamliel’s statement and in the Haggadah. And yet we put the <i>matzah</i> before the bitter herbs. Why do we even need a reminder of slavery and bitterness? We don’t have such a reminder on Purim or Chanukah – also reminders of God’s miraculous redemption.<br>Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sh’nei Luchot HaBerit</i>, Page 161b <b>Isaiah Horowitz</b>, (c. 1565 – March 24, 1630), also known as the <b><i>Shelah ha-Kadosh</i></b> (the holy <i>Shelah</i>) after the title of his best-known work, was a prominent rabbi and mystic. Horowitz was born in Prague in around 1565. He was a wealthy and active philanthropist, supporting Torah study, especially in Jerusalem. After serving as rabbi in many prominent cities in Europe, he left Frankfurt am Main - following the Fettmilch uprising - and assumed the prestigious position of rabbi of Prague. In 1620, after the death of his wife, he moved to Palestine and remarried there. He was kidnapped in Jerusalem and ransomed by the local Pasha; he then moved to Safed (1626), erstwhile home of Kabbalah. Horowitz died in Tiberias on March 24, 1630.</i> explains that it was because of righteous women that the Jewish people were redeemed from slavery. They knew that the people of Israel could not be redeemed until they gave birth to 600,000, equal to the number of letters in the Torah that they would receive at Mount Sinai. Therefore they remained attached and devoted to their husbands even in the face of oppression. That is why scripture says, “But the more they oppressed them, the more they increased and spread out.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 1:12</i> It was through the great oppression that a great purpose came about; the people were fertile and increased, and became a mighty nation of 600,000 so that they could become worthy of receiving the Torah. Therefore, the bitter herbs actually served the purpose of making Israel worthy of receiving the Torah – this happened after the Exodus so the question of bitter herbs also follows the question regarding the <i>matzah</i>.<br>The <i>Mah Nishtanah</i> implies this explanation. The child wants to know why we ask questions regarding freedom first before we ask questions about slavery. After all, <i>matzah</i> is a symbol of freedom while matzah and dipping are symbols of slavery. The dipping in <i>charoset</i> is a reminder of the mortar with which they made the bricks while leaning is a symbol of freedom. Even though Don Isaac Abarbanel suggested that <i>matzah</i> is a symbol of slavery and we call it the bread of affliction, in reality it is a symbol of freedom; that is why we are supposed to lean when we eat the <i>matzah</i>. There is also an association of freedom with bitter herbs, thus while we don’t lean when we eat the bitter herbs, it is permissible to do so!"

Why does the Haggadah add, “If God had not taken our ancestors out?” Also, why does it say “we would have been subjugated (<i>mishu’badim</i>),” as opposed to “we would have been slaves (<i>avadim</i>)?” And why does the text mention three generations when it says, “Us, our children, and our children’s children?” <br>There were two forms of oppression in Egypt: there was the oppression of Pharaoh whose heart was hardened and there was the oppression of being trapped in Egypt, which was filled with impurity and sorcery, from which they could not flee. The <i>matzah</i> and the bitter herbs are reminders of these two types of oppression which our ancestors faced in Egypt. The expression “And the Lord our God took us out” is a response to the first and more apparent form of oppression – the oppression of Pharaoh. The second expression, “with an outstretched arm,” is a response to the inner form of oppression which our ancestors faced in Egypt. Israel had already descended close to the fiftieth level of impurity and had they delayed their departure from Egypt even another moment, they never would have been able to escape. That is why God Himself had to redeem them rather than an angel or a messenger. The impurity had weighed them down greatly. This is what scripture says, “Has any god ever ventured to go and to take for himself one nation from the midst of another….”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:34</i> God did so on God’s own and with His own glory.<br><b>From there…</b> God brought Israel forth from a place of impurity.<br><b>With an outstretched arm…</b> This is a reference to the right hand of God which is associated with loving kindness (<i>chesed</i>) as we learn in scripture: “Your right hand, Lord, glorious in power; Your right hand shatters the foe.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 15:6</i> The right hand is mentioned twice in this verse, once for the <i>revealed</i> miracle of redemption and the other for the <i>hidden</i> miracle of redemption.",

How can the years that Pharaoh gave Israel be considered a valid gift since he gave them under duress? The Talmud says that if one buys a piece of property forcibly from someone, the transaction is not valid. Yet in the same discussion we learn that a divorce can be obtained through physical force because “It is a <i>mitzvah</i> to obey the teachings of the sages.” Giving a divorce is, in the interest of the sages, valid even when done under duress because it is a matter maintaining the will of the rabbis. If obeying the sages’ teachings can be placed on a person forcibly (and against his will), how much more so is that the case when it involves obeying the will of God! We learn from this statement that if God had not pressured Pharaoh, he might not have freed the people of Israel; still this agreement under duress is still a valid gift to Israel! <br>We speak of Israel being subjugated here and not slaves because the people of Israel were liberated from slavery in the month of Tishri, six months before the Exodus.

It is based on the fourfold levels of interpretation of scripture, PaRDeS: <i>Pshat, Remez, Drash</i> and <i>Sod</i>. This fourfold approach to the text is hinted at in the names of the Hebrew alphabet. When one writes out the names of the Hebrew alphabet, these are the only four letters that contain a <i>lamed- aleph gimel dalet lamed. Lamed</i> means learning. Therefore there are four types of ‘learning.’ One is related to the wise person who learns the simple meaning of the text from his teacher. One is for the discerning person who is able to gain meanings from hints (<i>remazim</i>) and allusions. One student of the Torah is called an ‘elder’ (<i>zaken</i>) when one can teach the masses the meaning and teachings of Torah. And one truly becomes knowledgeable in matters of Torah when he understands the hidden meaning of Torah. These four people should not say, “Why do we need to focus on the story of the Exodus – even a child in nursery school knows this story. Rather we should delve into the intricacies of the Passover offering and we will reveal the hidden meanings of the laws of Passover.” To this person, one should say, “Even so it is a commandment upon us to tell the story of the Exodus simply as a story as if we personally went forth from Egypt. It is beloved to tell the story at the proper time.”",

In 1691 he was in Amsterdam and began the printing of his work <i>P’ri Hadash</i> a commentary on the <i>Yoreh De'ah</i>.</i> suggests that we don’t make a separate blessing because the Kiddush mentions the Exodus and it counts as the blessing for the recitation of the story of the Exodus. But if he has already fulfilled is obligation of mentioning the Exodus by reciting the Kiddush, why is it necessary for him to tell the story at length? It is for this reason that it is necessary to say, “Whoever does so at length is praiseworthy.” Even though he has fulfilled the commandment, on this night we do more than simply mention the Exodus but tell the story at length.<br><b>Anyone who does so at length <i>(v’khol hamarbeh</i>)</b>: implies that we should go to great trouble to encourage children to ask questions, by dipping and doing all types of things that will pique their curiosity. We should also give out ‘parched corn’ and other treats so that they don’t fall asleep and fail to ask questions. Similarly, we should grab the matzah so that the children will stay alert. This is the reason that we hide the afikomen. To do so at length means to do so in different ways so that through these practices they will come to tell the story of the Exodus – and this is truly praiseworthy.<br><b>This Is praiseworthy: </b>Note that the text says, <i>Harai zeh mishubach</i> (This is praiseworthy) and not <i>Harai hu mishbach</i> (It is praiseworthy). The commentators were troubled by this expression – why use the word <i>zeh</i>, this.

Out of respect for the Patriarch, two sat to his right and two sat to his left. This story is brought as proof for the previous statement. Even though they were all experts in the four levels of Torah study, PaRDeS, they still spent the entire night recalling and recounting the story of the Exodus.

Or possibly, a fire came from heaven and surrounded them so that they couldn’t see that daytime had arrived. Therefore, their disciples came and said to them that one should not mix up commandments with one another; it is the obligation of the night to tell the story of the Exodus and now during the day it is an obligation to mention the exodus when one recites the final passage of the Shema. They came to tell them that it was time to conclude one commandment and to perform another.<br><b>Another explanation</b>: The reason that the students came to remind their teachers about the Sh’ma was to emphasize the two aspects of the Exodus. There are two aspects to the story of the Exodus: one is telling the story of the actual Exodus from Egypt and the ten plagues; the second is the story of the splitting of the Red Sea. We mention the splitting of the Red Sea in the morning as part of the Shacharit service. The sages spent the whole night recalling the story of the Exodus.

                    "<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah said</b>: There are a number of questions raised by Rabbi Elazar’s passage. First, why did the author of the <i>Haggadah</i> include this passage in the <i>Haggadah</i>? The <i>Mishnah </i>is actually <i>a </i>discussion of the daily obligation to make mention of the Exodus and not the observance of Passover and the telling of the story of the Exodus. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Berachot 12b</i> Second, this passage speaks of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah besting the sages in their discussion of when the Exodus from Egypt should be mentioned. Yet the sages were able to respond to his claim that the Exodus should be mentioned at night. While he identifies Deuteronomy 16:3 (“<i>All </i>the days of your life”) as the basis for mentioning the Exodus at night, they claimed that the word <i>kol,</i> “all,” is the basis for mentioning the Exodus “in the days of the Messiah.” <br>The sages did not disagree with Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah’s contention that one must mention the Exodus both at night and during the day. The sages disagreed about whether this obligation is based on the Torah or if it is a rabbinic obligation. This statement, as it appears in the <i>Mishnah</i>, begins, “We mention the Exodus from Egypt.” There is no suggestion that the sages disagreed with this statement. We are left to wonder what Rabbi Elazar meant when he said, “I was not privileged to know...” <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah’s explanation makes more sense than that of the sages. He explains the word <i>kol </i>(all) in Deuteronomy 16:3 as a reference to the night time and the word <i>yemai </i>(the days of) as a reference to the day time. This is the logical order of time since night precedes day in the Jewish calendar<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Consider, for instance, the opening chapter of Genesis where we read, “There was evening and there was morning, day…”</i>. The sages claim that <i>kol </i>refers to the messianic era while <i>yemai </i>refers to the present time. But according to the sages’ explanation, the order of the expressions is backwards since the present time should proceed the messianic era. <br>This verse was not necessary to prove that the Exodus should be mentioned at night by the sages or by Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. This should have been self evident. Since the Exodus began at night and the people left Egypt during the day, it would seem that day and night should be of equally important status. <br>Rabbi Elazar, however, treats the evenings differently because of the law of Passover; since we only observe the Passover feast until midnight on the eve of Passover <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When the angel of death “passed through” the land of Egypt.</i> and not throughout the whole night,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Joshua propounded above.</i> we need a proof text to teach that the Exodus can be mentioned <i>all night</i> on the other nights of the year. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, therefore, needed a proof text to distinguish Passover from the practice of mentioning the Exodus on the other nights of the year. The sages believed that the obligation to recount the Exodus story applied all night long on Passover eve all night long (as mentioned above). It was not necessary to have a proof text to distinguish Passover from the rest of the year. They used the additional word <i>kol</i> to teach us that the Exodus should be mentioned even in the messianic era. <br>Rabbi Elazar’s statement now becomes relevant to the observance of Passover and not just to the daily liturgy. According to him, the story of the Exodus must be recounted and the Passover observed by midnight on Passover but it can be mentioned any time during the night throughout the year. The word <i>kol </i>differentiates Passover from the daily recollection of the Exodus in the liturgy. This proof text helped Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah distinguish his point of view from that of the sages.",
                    "<b>I was not privileged to know the biblical source: </b>The word for ‘privileged’ (<i>zachiti</i>) can also be translated as ‘succeeded.’ Maimonides explains that Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was so engrossed in his studies, old age seemed to overtake him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides Commentary on the Mishnah, the end of chapter 1 of Berachot</i> The Talmud says that on the day that Rabbi Elazar was appointed head of the Sanhedrin he was only eighteen years old.

That night a miracle occurred and he became prematurely white-headed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT <i>Berachot </i>27b</i> <br>But why was this comment about Rabbi Elazar being like a seventy years old necessary? This comment is related to Talmudic discussion about whether words must be taken literally or can be understood figuratively. We learn in scripture that we are supposed to honor the elder and the person with white hair. The fact that Rabbi Elazar became prematurely white so that he would be properly honored as the head of the <i>Sanhedrin</i> suggests that we understand this teaching (regarding the elders) literally and that “words should be understood just as they are written.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT P<i>esachim </i>21b <i>Devarim kiktavan </i>(as written) is the subject of a disagreement between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehudah: should words of Torah be taken in their plain sense or can they be understood figuratively or metaphorically. Rabbi Elazar’s prematurely white hair suggests that he could only be honored when he truly appeared like a <i>zaken</i>, an elder</i> If that is so, then we must also conclude that the expression regarding the Exodus, “all the days of your life,” should also be “understood just as they are written.” This would mean that the Exodus should only be mentioned in the daytime and not at nighttime. On the other hand, if one holds that words can be understood differently from their literal meaning, then the word ‘all’ can be understood as a reference to the nighttime. Rabbi Elazar said that he assumed that scriptural words should be “understood just as they are written” and that it was only with Ben Zoma that Rabbi Elazar succeeded in understanding the principle that, ‘words need not be understood literally.’",

Do we not learn, “Assuredly, a time is coming” says the Lord “when it shall no more be said, ‘as the Lord lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt,’ but rather, ‘as the Lord lives who brought the Israelites out of the Northland and out of the land to which He has banished them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 16:14-15; also 23:8-9</i>’” Rabbi Natan said, the words, ‘that brought us up and that led’ prove that even in the future they will mention the Exodus from Egypt .<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Jeremiah 23 the same verse contains a double expression “Who brought us up and who led us” Rabbi Natan understands one term referring to the Exodus and the other to the future redemption.</i> The passage in the <i>Mekhilta </i>goes on to offer proof texts for the opening blessing of the <i>Amida </i>(that we say, ‘the God of Abraham…Isaac…and Jacob…’) and the Grace after the Meal. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Mekhilta</i> Parshat Bo, 16</i> <br>How then are we to understand Ben Zoma’s point of view? Elsewhere we learn that Ben Zoma held that in fact, the exodus will be mentioned in messianic time but the new redemption will be more essential and the Exodus will become secondary. Similarly, we learn regarding Jacob that even though he was given a new name, Israel, his old name was still used afterwards. Israel, however became his essential name and Jacob secondary. Yet if that is so then why do we say the God of Jacob in the opening blessing of the <i>Amida</i> – we should say the God of Israel since that is our forefather’s essential name! That is why the <i>Mekhilta </i>offers a proof text for the <i>Amida</i> in which the name of Jacob is used. Without a biblical citation we would have assumed that the opening blessing of the <i>Amida</i> should have said, ‘the God of Israel.’ It would seem then that Ben Zoma is in agreement with Rabbi Natan not only regarding the mentioning of the Exodus but in these other cases as well.<br>The continuation of the discussion in the <i>Mekhilta</i> is relevant to Ben Zoma’s point of view. We learn that while it is a transgression to refer to Abraham by his previous name, Abram, the same is not true for Jacob/Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT <i>Berachot</i> 13a</i> The reason for this is that the name Jacob has a negative and a positive connotation in the Torah.

Similarly, we learn that by mentioning the exodus in the <i>Birkat Hamazon </i>that mentioning the Exodus is relevant at all times, night and day and that Ben Zoma’s explanation is correct."

Bachya Ibn Pakudah (<i>Chovot Halevavot</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Chovot ha-Levavot</b> is the primary work of Bachya ibn Paquda, a Jewish philosopher and rabbi who seemingly lived at Saragossa, Spain, in the first half of the eleventh century. It was written in Judeo-Arabic in approximately 1040 under the title <i>Kitab al-Hidāya ilā Fara'id al-Qulūb</i>, <i>Book of Direction to the Duties of the Heart</i>, sometimes titled as <i>Guide to the Duties of the Heart,</i> and translated into Hebrew by Judah ibn Tibbon in the years 1161-80 under the title <i>Chovot ha-Levavot</i>.</i> Maimonides and others suggest that those who have the capacity of comprehending the oneness of God should engage in such analysis. This is accomplished through rational analysis; to arrive at belief without such analysis is not appropriate. A parable explains this. If a series of blind people try to follow one another with a seeing person leading them; if the sighted person falls into a pit, then all the others will fall in with him. <br>Each person must arrive at his own concept of God but not all concepts of God are the same. Not everyone is capable of such study and the ability to comprehend the unity of God is different for each student. According to a person’s knowledge and intellect he will arrive at different levels of understanding of God. Therefore, in this passage, when we say “the ‘ONE’ of the wise child, the ‘ONE’ of the wicked child, the ‘ONE’ of the simple child and the ‘ONE’ of the child who doesn’t know how to ask,” we are speaking about their different perceptions of God. A child is not yet ready to delve into this analysis so he is better off accepting belief in God based on tradition. For the wise, “One” means incomparable and indivisible, while for the simple child, ‘One’ is quantitative (God is one and not two). The ‘One’ that the wise child comprehends is the true oneness of God in the sense that the philosophers spoke of it.

                    "<b>That the Lord our God commanded you, <i>etkhem</i></b>: This is how it is written in Deuteronomy 6:20. Some commentators prefer to read this passage, “the the Lord our God commanded us, <i>o’tanu</i>,” so that he includes himself in the community and doesn’t exclude himself. The testimonies (<i>eidut)</i> – the <i>pesah </i>offering and the <i>matzah</i> - were performed as a way of remembering the Exodus from Egypt. The mishpatim, are those commandments which have a clear explanation. The statutes (<i>chukim</i>) - do not break the bones of the offering and only those assigned to the offering may eat it - are those laws that we continue to observe as a way for the present generation to keep the temple service in mind. The answer to the wise child is a response to the question, what are the statutes…we eat the afikomen as a way of reminding people of the temple connection of these laws. The wise child then is asking, “Why do we (<i>o’tanu</i>) observe these law” and we explain the connection between the statutes and the temple service. Even though these laws are connected to the ancient temple rite, they have become OUR laws in this time.<br>Some argue that the word <i>etkhem</i> is more fitting than <i>o’tanu</i> in this passage. The verse regarding the wise child says, “When your child asks tomorrow…what are…which God has commanded you (etkhem),”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 6:20</i> while the verse concerning the wicked child is, “When your child asks you, “What mean you (<i>lachem</i>) by this rite?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:26</i> The most important difference between these two verses is not the use of <i>etkhem</i> and <i>lachem</i>, but the time when the question is being asked. The wise child asks <i>machar</i>, tomorrow. While the ritual of Passover is taking place he joins in the celebration; he doesn’t want to confuse his elders while they are carrying out the Passover sacrifice. The following day after the ceremony, he asks about its significance in order to better understand meaning of the rituals. Regarding the simple child, the word <i>machar</i> is used suggesting that he asks about the ceremony after the fact. The wicked child, on the other hand, asks as the ceremony is happening; he is standing back and asking questions but not actively participating in the ceremony. This is all an intellectual exercise for him. His true intention is revealed by the way and when he asks his question. <br>But if this is the case for the wise child, the Torah should have said, “Who commanded US” and not who commanded you!” Why do we use the word <i>etkhem</i>, you, for the wise child? There are a number of places in scripture in which the word <i>etkhem</i> is like the word <i>imakhem,</i> with you; that is, it implies you and me together."

The wicked child challenges his parents. After all, there was no altar in Egypt; the essence of the sacrifice was the placing of the blood on the door posts and the lintel. He challenges his elders by claiming that this ritual is offered for their own benefit – so they can consume the sacrifice for themselves. The Torah offers the answer: “It is a Passover sacrifice…” Even though our ancestors did not have to make a sacrifice in Egypt but slaughter the animal and place its blood on the doorposts, we are commanded to do so as a reminder of the Passover offering.",

This expression implies the grinding of one’s teeth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 18:2 “Parents eat sour grapes and the children’s teeth are set on edge.”</i> The wicked in Egypt didn’t want to be included among those who were going to eat the Passover offering. God caused an aroma to the Garden of Eden to go forth from the roasted meat, making the wicked ravenously hungry. When they asked to eat the offering they were refused. This caused them to salivate and their teeth to grind. That is why the author of the Haggadah says <i>af attah</i>, “you ALSO,” set their teeth on edge. We are not the first to set the teeth of the wicked on edge; this happened in Egypt and we should do the same in response to their caustic comments.<br>A Kabbalistic explanation of “You also set his teeth on edge.” One who is not scrupulous in the observance of the laws of <i>chametz</i> and <i>matzah</i> will come under the control of the prince of Egypt and will become his slave. The law of slavery is that if one knocks out the tooth of his slave, his slave must be allowed to go free – therefore, knock out his tooth so that he will be freed from the powers of evil. I have heard that Jews have one more tooth than gentiles: sixteen on the upper bridge and sixteen on the lower bridge. Together they add up to 32 teeth which are equal to the 32 paths of wisdom as well as the 32 rules of interpretation attributed to Rabbi Yosi in the Sifra. We knock out the extra teeth from the wicked person because he has chosen to make himself like a gentile. He has done this by “denying the very essence of Jewish belief.” He doesn’t deserve to have the extra wisdom teeth!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">99</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The number 32 has special significance both in math, Kabbalah and in other mystical systems. In Lurianic thought: In a numerological sense, the Tree of Sephirot also has significance.

In answering the simple child the Torah uses the expression, “With a mighty hand” and it does not say, “With an outstretched arm.” Why is this? Earlier we saw that “With a mighty hand” refers to the outer manifestations of liberation from Pharaoh, while “With an outstretched arm refers to the inner expressions of liberation from idolatry and sorcery in Egypt. The simple child has no interest in the mystical significance of things, so in the Torah’s answer to him speaks of the outer manifestations of liberation.

Also called Samael and Samil, he is considered in legend both a member of the heavenly host (with often grim and destructive duties) and a fallen angel, equal to Satan and the chief of the evil spirits. One of Samael's greatest roles in Jewish lore is that of the angel of death. In this capacity he is a fallen angel but nevertheless remains one of the Lord's servants. As a good angel, Samael supposedly resides in the seventh heaven, although he is declared to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven.</i> That is why it was necessary for the Holy One to help free the Israelites from Egypt. The Prince of Egypt had to be defeated by God before Israel could be liberated from Egypt. <br>In the Jerusalem Talmud we find another version of this passage that is different from the one in the <i>Haggadah: “</i>What does the fool (<i>tipesh)</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">103</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Y<i>erushalmi</i> version uses the term <i>tipesh</i> instead of <i>tam</i>.</i> say? <i>Mah Zot</i> - What is this?

We are now left to wonder again about the difference between these two children who address the question to YOU and not to themselves.</i> The <i>Korban Eidah</i> explains that the wise child is asking specifically about the c<i>hukkim</i>, statutes, and that the wise child’s question is motivated by humility. Statutes have no explanation but he feels that the wise people of his generation might have some explanation for them, so he asks them the reason for these commandments. The wise child today, on the other hand, is living at a time when the only Torah commandment for Passover is <i>matzah</i>, so there are no statutes (such as “not breaking a bone of the offering,” or “that the offering must be roasted”, etc). The Shelah explains that the answer, “One does not go to additional feasts after eating the Passover offering” is that type of statute since the reason for this law is to remind us of the Passover offering. This answer is a way of saying that even today there are <i>chukkim</i>, statutes or laws without rational explanations. <br>Midrash Peliah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A late Midrashic work written by Höschel of Cracow (d. 1663)</i> offers another explanation of the Simple child’s question. The letters that make up the words <i>mah zot, “</i>What is this,” can be rearranged to spell <i>zeh emet</i>, “This is truth.” As he says, so he is.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, his question is a reflection of his deep pursuit of the truth, even if he does so on a more superficial and simple level.</i> The four children represent the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, the four letter name of God. The <i>yud</i> represents wisdom and the wise child, the highest of the <i>Sephirot</i>. The wicked child is connected to the higher <i>hei</i>, the <i>Sephirah</i> of <i>Binah</i> or understanding. <i>Binah</i> is the source of judgment (and as a result also the source of evil). Those adept at the mysteries of mysticism know that the realms of impurity find their vitality through this <i>Sephirah</i>. The Simple child is represented in the letter <i>vav,</i> which is also the <i>Sephirah</i> of <i>Tiferet, </i>and the One who doesn’t know how to ask is connected to <i>Malchut. Malchut </i>has no illumination of its own but received all its illumination from the other <i>Sephirot</i>; so too, the one who doesn’t know how to ask is dependent on others for illumination. Malchut can be a source of compassion if it receives its illumination from <i>chokhmah or chesed, </i>or it becomes a source of judgment if it receives its illuminations from the <i>binah </i>or <i>din</i>. Now, since the simple child is associated with <i>tiferet, </i>it stands to reason that it is also connected to truth. <i>Tiferet </i>is associated with the quality of truth, <i>emet</i>.

The repetition of language is also strange: “I brought your father, Abraham.” Why is it necessary to say both our forefather and Abraham?<br>If this verse mentions Abraham, why doesn’t it also mention Isaac and Jacob? <br>Finally, the verse says, “(<i>Mei’olam</i>) your ancestors dwelt on the other side of the Jordan.” What does the word <i>mei’olam</i> add to the verse? <br>Before the Patriarchs, people referred to their ancestors in the chain of generations as “forefathers.” Once Abraham arose, and brought illumination to the world by teaching others about the existence of God, the term, ‘forefather,’ was now applied only to him. We no longer called the previous generations as our forefathers; only Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are our forefathers. Because of their great importance as well as their deep love of God and the contribution they made to future generations, we think of everything beginning with them. <br>This is what we find in the book of Joshua and in the <i>Haggadah</i>. “In ancient times” our ancestors who worshipped idols were considered “our forefathers” but now that God brought us closer to His service, we are like converts whose lineage begins from the moment of their conversion. The future lineage begins from a convert. Terach may have been Abraham’s father but only Abraham is our forefather because his father was an idolater.

This might explain, as an aside, why Abraham could refer to her as his sister! See Midrash regarding Charan’s status, Genesis Rabbah 38:14</i> The verse goes on to say, “And I took your father…” The word ‘took’ implies that God created him anew so that those who came before him would no longer be called forefathers. That is why our first forefather’s name is <i>Avram, Av Ram</i> – literally exalted father. Through him the name ‘forefather’ was exalted, as though he were the very work of God’s hands. God then bequeathed a letter to him from His great name – the letter <i>hei </i>– so that his name became <i>Avraham</i>. The text alludes to this earlier: “This is the generations of heaven and earth in their creation.

The decree of slavery and oppression was supposed to be applied to a full period of four hundred years aside from living as strangers in a strange land. However, if the people repented and prayed to God, then God would calculate the period from the birth of Isaac and the end would come sooner. But if the people did not repent, then there would be a period of four hundred years of slavery and oppression. God did not reveal this to Israel because human beings must have free will to make choices on their own. This is alluded to in the expression <i>yodoah teidah- </i>there are two possible outcomes of God’s will depending on the choices the Israelites make. The 400 years can begin from the birth of Isaac or it can be 400 years of misery in Egypt.<br><b>And so also the nations that they served I will judge</b>: Even though God had decreed Israel’s exile and slavery, Egypt still was subject to punishment because they choose how severe to make Israel’s servitude. God only decreed that they live in a land not their own and be oppressed for 400 years – He did not decree the extent of the oppression. The Egyptians chose to oppress them ruthlessly for 210 years – therefore they deserved to be judged by God. The verse says “the nations that they served I will judge (<i>dan anochi</i>).” The word <i>anochi </i>is unnecessary here.

Only God could calculate the end of this period from the birth of Isaac. That is why it says that God calculates the <i>keitz</i>, the end. The gematriah of <i>keitz </i>is 190 leaving 210 years. Also Sarah was 90 and Abraham was 100 when Isaac was born – adding up to 190, <i>keitz</i>.

The Israelites could not leave Egypt until there were six hundred thousand like the number of letters in the Torah. They were lacking just one so God counted Himself as the One.

Esau had reason to want to kill his brother since he had cheated him; Laban, on the other hand had no reason to hate Jacob. Jacob cheated Esau out of his birthright and his blessing while Laban’s hatred of Jacob was without cause or reason. Another reason for discussing Laban is that, according to one a liturgical poem<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hifchadita arami b’emesh layila</i></i>, Laban pursued Jacob and his family on the eve of Passover.

In Aram, Laban sought to destroy Jacob and his sons even though they were his grandsons, and Jacob went forth with great wealth, just as the Israelites did from Egypt. We see here that hatred is expressed in many ways – and the worst of all hatred is the hatred of another’s faith. Rashi explains that the very thought of destroying Jacob and his family was considered the same as having carryied out the deed. Also, Laban was a mighty wizard, the grandfather of Bila’am (one of Israel’s greatest enemies) and his hatred of Jacob was deeply rooted in his heart.

A <i>gezerah shavah</i> is a verbal analogy, a fundamental principle of biblical interpretation.

The <i>Kal Vachomer</i> principle asserts that if the law is stringent in a case where we are usually lenient, then it will certainly be stringent in a more serious case. Rabbi Weil now argues that each of the two explanations for the oppression of the Israelites is based on one of these principles.</i> Two reasons that are given in the <i>Midrash</i> to explain why Israel was enslaved and treated so severely in Egypt. One explanation, attributed to Rabbi Elazar, is that the Israelites were punished with 210 years of slavery because Abraham subjected his students to forced service when he took them in his posse along to rescue the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nedarim 32a, See Genesis 14:14</i> A second reason is found elsewhere for the severity of the slavery: “Rav said: ‘A person should not treat his children differently from one another for we see that it was because of some material worth a couple of coins which Jacob gave Joseph that his children went down to Egypt.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT <i>Shabbat </i>10b</i> The <i>Tosafot</i> write that were it not for Jacob’s favoritism, it would not have been decreed, “They enslaved them and oppressed them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Weil offers a third explanation but rejects it. The Rosh (Rabbi Asher ben Yechiel, a 13th century scholar) questions the opinion in <i>Nedarim</i> and argues that Israel was enslaved in Egypt for 210 years because Abraham questioned God’s promise, when he said, “God how am I to know if I shall possess the land?” (Genesis 15:8) The Rosh’s explanation is appropriate for why the Israelites had to live in exile but not why they were afflicted so severely.</i> <br>We see, then, that there are two explanations for the severity of slavery in Egypt: one is the lack of equality in the way Jacob treated his sons and the other had to do with the forced service that Abraham imposed on his students. Why the severity of punishment for these two sins? Pressing scholars of God’s law into service is wrong! The sages taught: “One who uses the Torah for personal gain should perish,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pirke Avot</i> 4:7</i> and elsewhere, “We learn that the dignity of the Torah scholar is greater than a <i>Sefer Torah</i> from a <i>Kal Vachomer</i>: if we must stand before the Torah scroll, how much more so should we stand in the presence of those who study it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT <i>Makkot</i> 22b</i> The other point of view – that Israel was oppressed because Jacob’s favoritism is based on a <i>gezerah shavah</i>.

Both of them were fearful that if they did, God would turn from his anger and forgive the Israelites and thus redeem them. When the old Pharaoh died, however, it was the practice of the Egyptians to pause in order to mourn his passing, and for all the people and slaves to cry out and sigh as a sign of mourning for the king. This gave the Israelites the opportunity to cry out to God in response to their oppression. That is why the verse says they cried out on account of their slavery.”<br>The name <i>elohim</i> appears four times in this Exodus 2:23-25, the verses that are quoted here in the <i>Haggadah</i>. The word <i>elohim</i> also has the same numerical value as the word <i>kos</i>, cup.

I assume that this means that we can write the five letters of God’s name, <i>elohim</i>, 120 different ways.</i> of the divine name <i>elohim </i>so that four times the permutations of the divine name are equal to <i>Lilith</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I am totally lost here…but the author seems to be saying that these numerical values and permutations seem to suggest that the four cups of wine are meant to protect us from the Power of Lilith.

The Israelites had accepted their oppression in Egypt because it also caused them to give birth to more children. But when they saw their children being killed so that Pharaoh could soak in their blood, “They groaned because of the slave labor.” The children that were killed by Pharaoh’s magicians, however, were not destined to reach adulthood anyway. We see that this is the case when Moses saved the Israelite from death at the hand of the taskmaster. Actually this person was one of the mixed multitude and was not worthy of being saved.

                    "<b>And he saw our affliction- this refers to refraining from marital relations</b>: The Torah reads the expressions, “affliction,” “hard labor,” and “oppression” in a counter intuitive way. Literally, what the verse tells us is that first, Pharaoh, “oppressed” the Israelites by making their life unbearable; then he “imposed hard labor” upon them by forcing them to perform tasks they couldn’t complete; and finally, Pharaoh “afflicted them” by beating them and forcing them to complete these tasks. So why didn’t the Torah reverse the order of these expressions. It should have been: “our oppressing, our hard labor and our affliction.” That is, the Haggadah explains, what each of these expressions implies. “Our affliction” refers to the forced separation of couples.<br>Some explain the expression “They saw our affliction” to mean that the Egyptians forbade the Israelite men from sleeping in their own homes so that they should be up and out early in the morning. This explanation is forced since we are not told that Pharaoh made such a decree, and if it was his intention to separate the men and women, he could have simply forbade them from marrying one another. Some of the commentators have suggested that the men voluntarily separated themselves from their wives so that they would not give birth to infants who would then be thrown in the Nile by the Egyptians. But this explanation is also difficult for we learn that when Amram divorced his wife following the Egyptian decree against the babies, Miriam convinced him to remarry Yocheved. As a result all the men took their wives back – suggesting that there was no “forced separation” of men and women except for a short period of time. The <i>Haggadah</i> suggests here that the forced separation lasted throughout the period of oppression.<br>Rather, it may be that the men chose not to dwell in their homes so that they would not feel desirous of their wives. In this way the Egyptians would not be suspicious of the Israelite women and check to see if they were pregnant. The Egyptians would say that the Israelite men did not go to their homes so they could go quickly to work each day. The Israelite women knew that they would not be redeemed until they had given birth to 600,000 children. What did these righteous women do? They would take two buckets to the well. They would draw out two buckets, one filled with water and the other with little fish. They would then go to the field to visit their husbands. They would help them wash and then they would feed them; then they would engage in intimate relations. When they became pregnant the women would go to their homes, and when the time to give birth, they would go and give birth in the field, as Rabbi Akiva explains.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Sotah 11b</i><br>It is to this story that the expression “And He saw our affliction” is referring. “God saw” what the Israelites were doing.

The infant boys were being thrown into the Nile River; but what “hard labor” was there as a result of the boys? What is the connection between these “hard labor” and “infant boys?” We learn that the women gave birth in the fields and that God then sent an angel to care for them, as an animal cares for its young – so how can this be considered “hard labor?” We also learn that God provided the infants with two rings, one of honey and the other of oil, and when they were old enough they returned to the Israelite settlements in herds like sheep.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Sotah 11b</i> However, when the women came to the fields to tend to their husbands, they found the men exhausted from their hard labors and unable to be intimate with their wives. Still, the men engaged in sexual relations with their wives so that the Egyptians would not be able to fulfill Pharaoh’s decree to kill the Israelites babies, as he said “All the male children shall be cast into the Nile.” This happened at the noon hour when they were allowed to rest – after eating, they engaged in relations with their wives when they should have rested, as the doctors had recommend. Afterwards, the men went back to their work, as the Midrash says, “And our oppression – this is the severe pressure.”",

Here he offers an aside on the breakdown of the plagues.</i> Why does Rabbi Yehudah divide the plagues up into three groupings of three, three and then four? They could have been divided up into pairs or into two groupings of five? The <i>Kol Bo</i> and Abudraham both comment that in each grouping the first and second plague is prefaced by a warning while the third plague in each grouping occurs without a warning. The tenth plague is joined to the last three because it is one of a kind and separate from all the rest.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">173</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a warning for the tenth plague so it does not seem to follow the pattern of the first three groupings. Since it is the last of the plagues, there should have been no warning and the people of Egypt should have been punished.</i> This does not explain the connection between the final plague and the previous ones. A better explanation can be found in the interpretation of Psalm 136: “Who struck Egypt through their first born.” It should have said, “Who struck the first born in Egypt!”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">174</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalm 136:10 See <i>Midrash Tehillim</i></i> This is a reference to the firstborn - we learn that the firstborn killed more people than died during the tenth plague in Egypt. Before the tenth plague, the Egyptian firstborn told their people to free the Israelite slaves so that the they would not die. When the people refused to free the Israelites, the first born of Egypt took up their weapons and began killing their fellow Egyptians. This was in a sense, ‘an eleventh plague.’ There was no warning for the rebellion of the first born against the people of Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">175</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See BT Shabbat, 87b, Tosafot, “V’otan”</i> This is how the Midrash explains Psalm 136:10 – God struck Egypt by fermenting a rebellion of the first born before the tenth plague. Like the other series of plagues, then, there was no warning during the tenth plague, and before the plague of the first born. The worst part of the tenth plague was the death caused by the first born; and this is why Rabbi Yehudah grouped the plagues as he did so, that the death caused by the first born was the climax of the plagues.<br>This also explains the <i>Midrash</i> which states that the tenth plague was just recompense for casting the Israelites infants into the Nile River. The tenth plague was an example of <i>midah k’neged midah</i>, measure for measure:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">176</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a concept commonly used in Midrashic literature which claims that Gods rewards and punishments are commensurate with the actions they are either rewarding or punishing.</i> just as the Egyptians cast the Israelite boys into the Nile, so God took the lives of the Egyptian first-born. The problem with this explanation is that it does not account for the singling out of the first born. <i>Midah keneged midah</i> should have applied to all the Egyptian males and not just the first born. So why did the tenth plague strike only the first born of Egypt? The worst part of the tenth plague was not just the death of the first born in Egypt but the revolt of the first born in which they killed many other Egyptians as well: so in the end between the death of the first born and the death of other Egyptians, the tenth plague was measure of measure recompense. There were two aspects to the tenth plague just as there were two aspects to Pharaoh’s decree against the Israelite babies: it was cruel to the babies and cruel to the parents who watched their children being killed. So in the tenth plague: there was the terror that the first born faced and the terror that the people of Egypt faced from the death of the first born. Finally, the revolt of the first born was a supernatural plague because it is against the laws of nature for sons to kill their fathers."

There is a problem with this explanation. God had already performed this miracle five days earlier when the Israelites set aside a lamb for sacrifice and announced to their Egyptian neighbors that they were going to slaughter it as a sacrifice as we learn in the <i>Midrash</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">179</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemot Rabbah, 16:3</i>. Rabbi Eliezer Ashkenazi (<i>Ma’aseh Adonai</i>) explains that the entire Egyptian people became ill during the final plague but only the first born died. “The destroyer” brought the illness but only God struck the first born. The term implies that not only did God protect the people from the plague, but from the illness which struck the Egyptian households. Thus, God carried out the tenth plague by Himself while the destroyer sickened the Egyptians.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">180</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemot Rabbah 17:5</i> There is a controversy in the Midrash regarding the expression, “For when God passes through to smite the Egyptians…”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">181</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:23</i> According to one point of view, this implies an angel performed the deed, and according to the other point of view, it implies that God performed the tenth plague by Himself. According to the first point of view (that God was assisted by an angel) the word ‘smite’ implies that the pregnant Egyptian women who were ready to give birth miscarried on the night of the tenth plague so that God could take the lives of the new born first-born infants (thus showing that there were angels involved in this plague) while the other point of view God acted alone.<br>The first opinion which claims that God was assisted by an angel is problematic since the verse says, “God passed through Egypt (and does not mention an angel passing through Egypt).” What happened initially was carried out by an angel but ONLY God struck the first born.<br>According to the second opinion, that God struck the Egyptians all by Himself, we still have a problem. According to Psalms 78:49, Egypt was struck by, “wrath, indignation, trouble, and a band of deadly messengers.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">182</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse will be the subject of some discussion when we read about Rabbi Eliezer’s and Rabbi Akiva’s discussion of the plagues. Here it is relevant because we again find a reference to God not performing all the plagues by Himself but rather by having angels that assisted him.</i> According to Rabbi Ashkenazi, this verse does not apply to the first born but to all the other people who were struck by the plagues. God struck down the first born while the oldest (who wasn’t a firstborn) in the household were stuck down by “deadly messengers.”<br>In my opinion,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">183</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Weil offers his own take here; the passage begins with the expression, “In my humble opinion…”</i> it is troubling to suggest that the impure firstborn of Egypt were struck down by the Holy One, since to have one’s life taken by a kiss from God is considered to be a blessing. Why would the exalted One bother with those who were uncircumcised and impure? Therefore (I think) that while God struck them with a plague, it was the “Destroyer” who actually killed the firstborn afterwards. This is the language of the Torah: “I struck all the firstborn;” this is a generic strike but not necessary a mortal strike. God struck each of the firstborn because only He could know which of the males in Egypt was actually first born and which were not. Then the angels of destruction smote the firstborn. We can now explain the verses in the book of Psalms, “He inflicted His burning anger upon them, wrath indignation, trouble, a band of deadly messengers. He cleared a path for His anger; He did not stop short of allowing them to by killed (by others), but gave them over to pestilence. He struck every first born in Egypt, the first fruits of their vigor in the tents of Ham.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">184</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 78:49-51</i> The expression, “He cleared a path,” implies that God cleared the way but the angel of death did the deed."

He is the main halachic authority for Ashkenazic Jewry. He passed away in 1572.</i> regarding the proper method of pouring a bit of wine from the cup when we mention the ten plagues. He claims that it is customary to pour or to sprinkle 16 drops of wine from one’s wine cup at this point: three for “Blood, fire and pillars of smoke;” ten for the plagues; and three for <i>D’ztakh Adash Ba’achav</i>. These 16 drops are for the Holy One’s sword which is called <i>Yohakh (Yud Hei Vav Kaf)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">201</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The words Yohakh contain the final letters of the four Hebrew words which say, <i>Ki malakhav yitzaveh lakh</i>, “He will order His angels (to guard you wherever you go.)” – Psalm 91:11</i> <i>Yo</i> – God- <i>hakh</i> – strikes. The truly pious do not dip their fingers into the cup when they remove wine from their cup; instead they pour a bit directly from the cup.<br><br>ח ש כ<br>ש ח נ<br>כ נ ם<br>This suggests that these three plagues are connected to one another; each plague contains a manifestation of the other two plagues. Each plague represents three plagues – instead of three plagues, they would then be nine plagues. Along with the other seven plagues that would make sixteen plagues! This would also explain, why, when it came to the third plague, the magicians of Egypt were unable to perform the plague like Moses, and they declared, “It is the finger of God!” The magicians of Egypt were able to perform one magical act at a time; they were not able to recreate two or three plagues at the same time. It was then that they realized that Moses was not performing miracles. Rather he was acting with the help of God.<br>Why did the Egyptian magicians say, “It is the finger of God,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 8:15</i> during the third plague? According to a Midrash<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yalkut Shimoni, Parshat Vaera</i> there were fourteen types of vermin in Egypt during the third plague – the smallest of which was the size of an egg. The Egyptians could not replicate this plague because they could not perform so many acts at the same time. That is how the magicians knew that it was the ‘finger of God,’ and not an act of magic.<br>But there is problem with the claim that darkness, lice and boils are interconnected. We learn elsewhere that blood, frogs and lice were performed by Aaron; wild animals, pestilence and the death of the first born by God; hail, locust and darkness by Moses. Boils was performed by all three of them together.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shemot Rabbah 12:4</i> If this is so, then lice and darkness should also have been performed by (all three) Moses, Aaron and God, since boils was part of lice and darkness. It therefore stands to reason that the plague of boils must have been performed by God as well.<br>Earlier, we saw that there is an issue with including the death of the first born along with the last grouping of three plagues in <i>d’tzakh, a”dash </i>and <i>ba’achav</i>. In each of these groupings of plagues, the third (lice), sixth (boils) and ninth (darkness) struck without warning; in the case of the tenth plague there was a warning. We have answered this question by pointing out that though Pharaoh was warned of the tenth plague, he was not warned of the attack of the first born against Egypt. The final plague was against the first born as well as all those who were killed by them. Also, just as there were two aspects to the plague of the first born, so there were multiple aspects to the plagues of lice, boils and darkness, as we have seen above. (We do not count the attack of the tenth plague as two separate plagues since both involved the first born.)<br>Hidden in the abbreviations <i>D’tzakh, a”dash </i>and <i>ba’achav </i>is the entire story of Israel’s redemption from Egypt<i>: </i>When combined, the final letters of these three abbreviations spell <i>kesev </i>(lamb). The first letters of the abbreviations spell <i>eved </i>(slave). And the middle letters spell <i>tzei chad</i> (in one go out). Hidden in the abbreviation, then, we learn that the people of Israel would have been slaves forever had they waited one more second in Egypt. They would have descended below the forty-ninth level of impurity; ‘they went out because of one more second.’ It was because of the merit of a lamb (that is, the Passover sacrifice) which they offered that they were worthy of being redeemed from Egypt. The letters <i>kesev</i> also spell <i>kavash</i> – because the Israelites sacrificed the lamb in Egypt, they vanquished the angelic prince of Egypt and could be redeemed. This is why the verse in Psalms says, “He struck Egypt through their first born,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 136:10</i> and not “He struck the first born of Egypt.” By striking down the prince of Egypt who is called the first born of Egypt, God redeemed the people of Israel. In exchange for this God said, “Sanctify for me your first born.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">207</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 13:2</i><br>This also explains the law of Passover: unlike the regular dietary laws, even a bit of leavening renders food <i>chametz</i>. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">208</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a concept in the laws of Kashrut of <i>batel b’shishim</i>, if the amount of non kosher food or dairy that falls into a meat mixture is one sixtieth, it does not make the whole unkosher.</i> Just as the words, <i>chametz</i> and <i>matzah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">209</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The words <i>chametz </i>and matzah are almost the same – the letters, <i>hay</i> and <i>chet</i> which are very similar to one another and are distinguished by a tiny line. ח ה</i> are only distinguished by a tiny bit, so even another second in Egypt would have rendered Israel unredeemable. All of this is hinted at in Rabbi Yehudah’s abbreviation.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz, <i>Shnei Luchot Haberit</i>, <i>Masechet Pesachim</i></i><br>There is another aspect to the final plague that makes it similar to the third, sixth and ninth plague. This plague struck not only the people of Egypt but the first born Egyptians who were born outside of Egypt or who were living in other lands. Like the final plagues in the other groupings, they were struck without warning. In this matter, Rabbi Yehudah disagrees with the previous statement in the Haggadah, which says, “These are the ten plagues which the Holy one brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt…” This statement implies that the plagues only struck those Egyptians in the land of Egypt while Rabbi Yehudah was of the opinion that the plagues struck Egyptians no matter where they lived.",
                    "<b>These are the ten plagues that the Holy One brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt</b>: Two questions are raised regarding the plagues by this statement. First, why was it necessary to say “upon the Egyptians in Egypt?” And second, why does the Haggadah say “Rabbi Yehudah said that (God) placed signs upon them?”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a literal translation of Rabbi Yehudah’s statement but probably not the actual meaning of the statement. Sometimes the literal is not the actual meaning of an expression.</i> In these verses the expressions, “upon the Egyptians,” and, “upon them,” are superfluous. The Torah states: “Go to Pharaoh for I will harden his heart and the heart of his servants in order that I might place My signs within them…that I performed in Egypt and the signs which I placed upon them.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 10:1</i> Here too we find redundant language: first the verse states “I placed within them,” and then, “the signs I placed upon them.” This implies that God literally placed “His signs upon them,” that is, their bodies. Yalkut Shimoni, a midrashic work,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yalkut Shimoni on Psalms 105</i> states that Rabbi Yehudah’s abbreviated version of the ten plagues was incised into the skin on their bodies. This is what the Haggadah means when it states: “On the Egyptians in Egypt,” and what the statement “<i>asher</i> - that (God) placed upon them,” means; literally on them. The word <i>asher</i>, “that,” has the same <i>gematriah</i> (numerical value) as <i>d’tzakh, a”dash ba’achav.</i><br><b>The Plague of the firstborn: </b>When the plagues are first listed, the final plague is called <i>makat bechorot</i>, “the plague of the first born,” while Rabbi Yehudah simply refers to the tenth plague as <i>bechorot</i>. What is the significance of this difference? The first listing of the plagues refers to the plague and not to the one who was affected by the plagues. Therefore, the essential word is <i>makat, </i>“the plague of,” emphasizing that the firstborn were struck by God but then died at the hands of the angel of death, as stated earlier.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See earlier discussion “Not by an angel.”</i> Rabbi Yehudah, on the other hand, says <i>bechorot</i>, because he was of the opinion that the first born were not only the victims of the tenth plague but the source of the tenth plague as well. They were not only struck down by God but they attacked and killed many Egyptians."

Each plague in Egypt was an <i>etzba</i>, a forefinger, according to the language of the Torah. The one who says it is the ring finger agrees with Rabbi Eliezer who argues that each of the plagues in Egypt was like four plagues – the ring finger is the fourth finger.

Rabbi Yosi felt there had to be fifty plagues at the sea in order to free the Israelites from the forty nine levels of impurity into which they had fallen in Egypt. Rabbi Eliezer felt there had to be 240 plagues – forty in Egypt and 200 at the sea to repay the Egyptians for the bitterness of Israel’s oppression. In Hebrew letters bitterness is written mar, which equals 240. When reversed, the letters <i>mem reish</i> spell <i>ram</i>, exalted; through the plagues God’s presence was exalted above all the nations.

It could be that Rabbi Eliezer was suggesting that the four “dimensions” as a reference to the four weeks in a month. Or it could have to do with the law of four or five time fines in repayment for the robbery of live stock.

Rabbi Akiva says that the fine should be five times (like the pay for stealing an ox)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Exodus 21:37</i><br>Yet another explanation has to do with the reason for the punishment of the Egyptians. Israel was redeemed because they didn’t engage in adultery, gossip, they didn’t change their names to Egyptian names, they maintained their own language, and they dressed distinctively. Rabbi Eliezer counts these as four reasons for Israel’s redemption because he considers the choice of not changing their names and clothes as one, while Rabbi Akiva counts them separately and arrives at five reasons. It was in merit of these practices – four or five that the Egyptians were punished.<br>Many commentators related the four fold or five fold dimensions of the plagues to the four elements of the world (air, water, fire, and earth); Rabbi Akiva adds a fifth element – the spiritual dimension from the upper world.<br>The <i>Maaseh Adonai</i> suggests that the four fold punishment was to make up for the four fold debt of the Egyptians: damages, suffering, disability and embarrassment that they caused the Israelites.

Yet we find the expression, “the hand of Adonai”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 9:3</i> is also used to describe the fifth plague, pestilence. So the word ‘hand’ is used to describe the individual plagues and not just the splitting of the sea. The Egyptians were able to copy the first two plagues. It was only with the third plague that they failed to repeat Moses’ actions. Now, with the fifth plague, Moses acknowledged that all the plagues were the power of God.<br>Why do we say “hand” when we speak of pestilence? This plague is different from all the others. There are five plagues about which we are told that animals were affected: lice, pestilence, hail, boils, and the first born. Of these, four were against humans and animals; only pestilence is an attack solely against animals. Since pestilence affected only animals, Moses made a point of pronouncing that it was the hand of God. The five plagues were the five fingers of the hand of God. The other five plagues only struck human beings.<br>“The hand of Adonai will strike your livestock.” The Torah says “hand” because it mentions five types of livestock: horses, asses, camels, cattle and sheep, which were affected by this plague. Surely, however, the plague of pestilence affected other types of livestock! By mentioning five it suggests something about the unique nature of this plague – it only affected these types of animals."

It should have mentioned the ‘killing of the firstborn’ immediately after ‘executing judgment’ and only then mentioned, ‘doing so against their gods.’ We see this in scripture: “I struck down the first born of Egypt and against all the gods of Egypt I executed judgment.” <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 12:12</i><br>We see, however, the judgment of Egypt’s gods actually took place before the plague of the first born. Initially, God instructed the Israelites to set aside a lamb on the Sabbath before the first Passover, tied to their bed post. When the Egyptians asked the Israelites what they were doing, they told them that they were setting aside a lamb that would be sacrificed to God. Even though the lamb was the god of Egypt, there was nothing the Egyptians could do about this. Thus, the Israelites were able to vanquish the god of Egypt four days before the first born were struck down.<br>Why does the statement “But not given us their wealth…” follow “If he had killed their first born?” We learn from the story of Gebiha ben Pesisa that the Israelites were paid for their many years of service to the Egyptians.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Sanhedrin 91a Gebiha ben Pesisa is the subject of a series of stories in which he is sent to Alexander the Great to argue on behalf of the Jewish people: On another occasion the Egyptians brought a lawsuit against the Jews before Alexander of Macedon. They pleaded thus: 'Is it not written, “<i>And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and they lent them [gold and precious stones</i>, etc.”] Then return us the gold and silver which ye took!' Gebiha ben Pesisa said to the Sages, 'Give me permission to go and plead against them before Alexander of Macedon: should they defeat me, then say, \"Ye have merely defeated an ignorant man amongst us;\" whilst if I defeat them then say, \"The Law of Moses has defeated you.\"' So they gave him permission, and he went and pleaded against them. 'Whence do ye adduce your proof?' asked he. 'From the Torah,' they replied. 'I too,' said he, 'will bring you proof only from the Torah, for it is written; <i>Now, the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years</i>. Pay us for the toil of 600,000 men whom ye enslaved for 430 years.' Then King Alexander said to them, 'Answer him!' 'Give us three days' time,' they begged. So he gave them a respite; they sought but found no answer. Straightway they fled, leaving behind their sown fields and planted vineyards. And that year was a Sabbatical year.</i> But the law is that when there is a physical punishment for a wrong doing then the monetary fine is cancelled. The fact that God caused the firstborn to die might lead us to conclude that we do not have a right to collect a monetary fine as well. The death of the firstborn should have been “enough.” The silver and gold went even farther than they deserved.<br>Furthermore God promised Abraham that his descendents would leave Egypt with great wealth after 430 years of slavery. They did not serve so many years, so had they left without the wealth would have been enough – and yet God rewarded them with great wealth.<br><b>He split the sea</b>: According to Pirke Avot 5:5,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Itemized by Rambam &amp; R’ Ovadiah of Bartenura</i> there were ten miracles at the Red Sea: (1) God split the sea into two parts. (2) He caused the water to be like a great tent over their heads. (3) He caused the sea floor to be completely dry. (4) When the Egyptians entered the sea the floor turned to mud. (5) The water became frozen like small building blocks, to honor the Israelites as they passed through the sea. (6) It became hard like rocks. (7) The sea split into twelve isles for the different tribes. (8) It became clear like glass so there was light and the people could see one another. (9) Sweet, good water spurt forth like a fountain for them to drink. (10) Whatever they didn’t drink afterwards piled up, thus blocking he way of the Egyptians.<br>According to the <i>Midrash</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus Rabbah 21:10</i> there were other miracles at the sea as well. We learn that trees grew on each side with all types of fruit, and even when the Israelites allowed their feet to touch the water, it immediately became completely dry. To all of this, we say, “If God had given us wealth but not split the sea – that is, if God had brought us out of Egypt by way of the Philistines instead of splitting the sea, it would have been enough. Or if God had allowed us to defeat the Egyptians and not split the sea, it would have been enough. These other ways of leaving Egypt could have taken place naturally without any miracles – that would have been sufficient. Instead God performed many miracles in the way He took us out of Egypt so that people would come to say - God is fighting for them! We say in dayeinu that God literally took us “into the dry land of the sea” - implying that the sea was like a tent and that it was a like blocks of glass through which they could see."

It implies that it was Rabban Gamliel’s practice to make this statement on Passover night. The other version which says, “Rabban Gamliel says…” implies that there were those who disagreed with Rabban Gamliel in this matter. Rabban Gamliel believed that one must explain the <i>Seder </i>customs based on the verse: “No, the thing shall be close to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">256</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 30”14</i> This verse teaches us that when the matter is explained in your mouth it will also be in your heart. The statement is then followed by, “Each person is obligated to see himself as if he went forth from Egypt,” and then the actual performance of the commandments takes place – the eating of <i>matzah</i> and <i>maror</i>. That is, we make the statement about experiencing the Exodus and then perform the commandments, just as the verse speaks of the mouth first followed by the heart.<br>The statement, “Has not fulfilled his obligation” is not meant to be a deterrent to performing the commandments. Whether one makes the statement or not, one has fulfilled the commandment if one has consumed <i>matzah</i> and <i>maror</i>. Rather, if one wishes to fulfill the commandment properly and completely, one will explain the reason for each commandment.<br>It is possible that Rabban Gamliel disagrees with Rabbis Yose, Eliezer, and Akiva. It is possible that they are stating that we are only obligated to tell the story of the Exodus (the enslavement of the Israelites and the ten plagues) and not the reason for the commandments. He follows their statements by saying, “That is not enough. If you haven’t explained the reason for <i>pesah, matzah</i> and <i>maror,</i> you still haven’t fulfilled the obligation of the night.” If this explanation is correct, then the proper reading of the text is, “Rabban Gamliel said….” Even so, those who fear God will fulfill both practices: Telling the story of the Exodus and explaining the different <i>Seder </i>practices. That is why we say Rabbis Akiva, Yose and Eliezer’s statements as well as Rabban Gamliel’s statement in our <i>Seder.</i><br>Another explanation: It is possible that Rabban Gamliel’s did not accept the suggestion that the Torah speaks of four types of children as we saw above. He explained that the so-called wise child’s question has nothing to do with Passover since it is a general question about why God gave us so many different types of commandments. The other three statements to explain Passover to the children, apply not to the type of children but to the three main practices at the Seder: <i>pesah, matzah and maror</i>.",

Yet it was unnecessary for the Torah to say that it was “the Lord’s Passover offering,” here. The Torah could have said, it is the Passover offering. The name of God comes to tell us about the purpose of this offering and where it would eventually lead the people of Israel. The statement that the Passover offering should be put aside on the tenth day (<i>yud) </i>and the offering was eaten five days (hay) after this which is written <i>hay. Yud</i>-<i>hay</i> are also the final letters of <i>halleluyah</i>. The Five <i>(hay) </i>Books of Moses were given on the sixth of <i>Sivan (vav) </i>together these two spell <i>out vav-hay</i>.

Normally, the Passover offering is consumed after the Festive offering. Yet the Talmud explains that if one has already recited the blessing for the Passover offering, he is exempted from the Festive offering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">260</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mishnah</i> in the final chapter of <i>Pesachim</i> says: “If he recited the blessing for the Passover-offering, he thereby exempts the [festival] sacrifice; [but] if he recited the blessing for the sacrifice, he does not exempt the Passover-offering:” this is the view of R. Ishmael. R. Akiba said: “the former does not exempt the latter, nor does the latter exempt the former.” The Festive offering is supposed to come first, before the Passover. If one recited the blessing for the Passover offering first, he is now considered exempt from doing so for the festive offering</i> The Passover offering is presented twice. It was brought to the celebrant after pouring the second cup of wine but it is not consumed until the end of the meal. The reason for this is to reflect its double meaning. Similarly, today we eat matzah twice during the <i>Seder</i>: at the beginning of the meal (when we recite the <i>motzi</i>) and at the very end of the meal (the <i>afikomen</i>). The question <i>al shum mah, </i>then, is meant to point to the two reasons we eat the Passover at the <i>Seder: </i>it is a symbol of our redemption from Egypt as well as the promise of our entrance into the land of Canaan. Here the verse is meant to answer both reasons for the Passover offering: first to remind us that God took us out of Egypt and second – of our eventual redemption and entrance into the land (“And the people bowed down in homage.”) Both explanations are hinted at in our answer to Rabban Gamliel’s question, <i>al shum mah</i>?"

Yet, Scripture explains that in Egypt, <i>matzah</i> was consumed for one day. It was only with the later observance of Pesach that we began to eat it for a whole seven days. Rabban Gamliel’s statement would then be an answer to the question of why we eat matzah for seven days and not just on the first day. Yet the Torah tells us this as well; in Exodus, chapter 12, Scripture says we should eat matzah for seven days. Here Rabban Gamliel explains a second reason we eat <i>matzah</i>: first we eat it because it is ‘the bread of affliction,’ and the second time (at the end of the <i>Seder</i>) we eat it is as a reminder of the ‘redemption from slavery.’<br>There are different traditions about which <i>matzah</i> one should hold up when reading Rabban Gamliel’s statement. According to some opinions, one should hold up the middle broken piece of <i>matzah </i>since it symbolizes the bread of affliction. Others claim that the hidden piece of matzah is considered to be the bread of affliction. Still others claim that one should hold up the top whole <i>matzah</i> as a symbol of redemption.

The essence of the redemption was the giving of the <i>Torah</i> to Israel. The <i>Torah</i> tells us that oppression and bitterness brought about an increase in the number of Israelites.

Why is there a difference in the status of these two symbols? According to Rabban Gamliel we are obligated by the <i>Torah</i> to see ourselves as if we went forth from Egypt. The <i>matzah</i> serves as a reminder of this biblical mandate while <i>maror </i>reminds us of slavery (which we are not obligated by the Torah to remember.) <i>Matzah</i> allows us to see ourselves in this fashion.<br>Yet, what purpose is there in “seeing ourselves” as if we personally went forth from Egypt; many generations have passed since the Exodus - what good is there is in seeing the redemption in this way? This teaches us that the purpose of the redemption was not just the liberation from slavery in Egypt but also the fact that we could enter the land of Israel, build the temple, and seek atonement for our sins. Also the matzah alludes to the future redemption as well. The afikomen is an allusion to the final redemption, which is called <i>tzafun bareikh, </i>the hidden blessing.

Rabbi Weil describes a cosmos in which the sun is revolving around the earth and against its will, it rises in the East and sets in the West.</i> The sun is like a king it is the like a king because it is the largest and most influential of all the heavenly bodies; it appears 365 days a year, and its place in the heavens determines the length of days and the seasons. Yet it is forced against its will to rise in the East and to travel toward the west which is the location of the <i>Shechinah</i>, the divine presence. It is through this process that we learn that that there is a higher power that determines all things in the universe. And because of this power, the sun must offer and sing praises to God. We see this as well in the story of Joshua and the battle of Gibeon in which the ‘sun stood still.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">273</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 10:12</i> The sun was forced to stand still against the natural process.

Similarly, we say: The heavens declare God’s glory and the firmament recount the work of his hands.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">274</sup><i class=\"footnote\">274274 Psalm 19:2</i> The commentators explain that God cannot be known by His essence; we can only know God through His actions. Thus we see through the cycle of the sun God’s providence upon all His creations, and that God is the creator of everything; God even determines the cycle of the planets and the stars. As we learn in the works of the Jewish philosophers there is no movement without a Prime Mover. The Movement of the sun (against its natural order) is sign that God is the Prime Mover. God is praised because God is always present and is the creator of all things.",

God is “far above nations” and does not involve Himself in the doings of this lowly world. Therefore they can feel that they can act in an evil fashion toward the people of this world and that they do not have to worry about fearing God or facing punishment. We have been given proof that God’s providence can be experienced in this world. We have four proofs: (1) The Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai; (2) God lowered Himself and dwelled over the Holy ark; (3) God brought Israel into the land of Israel and helped them to succeed; (4) In the future, God will dwell among the community or righteous and pious people.

God appeared to them like an old sage who sat and taught. This is what is meant by the verse, “God will stoop down low.”<br>It has been pointed out that there are <i>five extra yud’s at the ends of the verbs in this passage: hagbihi </i>(He lifted up) <i>hamashpili </i>(He stooped), <i>mikimi</i> (He lifts up), <i>l’hoshivi </i>(to cause to dwell), and <i>moshivi</i>. (He causes to dwell). The <i>yud</i> at the end of each of these words is a poetic flourish and unnecessary. What can we learn from them? There are those who explain the hidden meanings of the Torah who say that the five <i>yudin </i>equal fifty – they come to replace the missing verse in the <i>Ashrai</i> which should begin with a nun (50). Others explain that God never descended more than ten <i>tefachs</i> (a measure) to appear to the people.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT SUKKOT 5a</i> But the most literal explanation has to do with the name of God which begins with a <i>yud</i>. When God reveals Himself to the people of Israel, His name (which begins with a <i>yud</i>) is joined to the name Israel (which also begins with a <i>yud</i>). The letter <i>yud</i>, then, symbolizes the connection between God and Israel, between heaven and earth. <i>Yud</i> is also the last of the single digits and the first of the multiples of ten. That is what we mean when we say “I am the first and I am the last.” God’s name begins with a yud to teach us that God is the beginning and end of all things. Similarly God is the beginning and end of all the nations.

When Amram took Yocheved back Aaron and Miriam danced with joy and the angels rejoiced – that is why the word <i>eim</i> is an abbreviation for Aaron and Miriam. “<i>Halleluyah</i>” can be read as two words: <i>hallelu</i> (praise) and <i>Yah</i>, the name of God.

But what is the connection between the four cups of wine and the Passover offering. Elsewhere<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">286</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta Bo Chapter 5</i> we learn that the four cups of wine were in celebration for the four mitzvot which the Israelites performed while they were slaves in Egypt: (1) They were never suspected of sexual immorality. (2) They were not suspected of gossip or slander. (3) They continued to use the Hebrew language in Egypt. (4) They did not take on Egyptian names so that they had a distinctive identity. It was for these four reasons that there are four promises of redemption and four cups of wine. So what is the connection to the Passover offering? The words <i>tachosu al seh</i>, “Let them share one lamb” <i>Tachosu</i> refers to the <i>kosot</i>, the four cups of wine. And <i>al seh</i> stands for <i>arayot </i>(sexual immorality); <i>lashon harah</i> (gossip); <i>shem</i> (their names); and <i>hadibur</i> (their speech).<br>We can now interpret Psalm 114. <b>When Israel went forth from Egypt</b> – Israel the people who hadn’t changed their names. <b>The house of Jacob</b> – the women of Israel who maintained the highest standards of behavior. <b>From a foreign tongue</b> – the people did not change their language. <b>Judah became His holy one</b> – they did not desecrate God by speaking gossip and slander. And because of these four qualities, <b>Israel became their dominion…</b><br><b>Another Interpretation: </b>In Psalm 114 why do we first refer to the Jewish people as ‘Israel’ and then as ‘the house of Jacob?’ And why do we first say ‘Egypt’ and then, ‘a foreign tongue?’ We learn that one of the reason for that Israel had to spend time in Egypt was to redeem the holy sparks that were still present there and to convert those who had such holy sparks in them. Thus, the House of Jacob refers to the converts. We say, Israel went forth from Egypt and the converts from among the people who spoke in a foreign tongue… The prohibition against living in Egypt only applied in ancient times when these holy sparks had already been taken out of Egypt. But today, once again there are sparks in Egypt so we must live their just as we live throughout the Diaspora to bring about this redemption of sparks. Rabbi Isaac Luria explains the verse: “At the end of 430 years the host Israel went forth from Egypt.” We do not say ‘children of Israel went for the Egypt’ in order to teach that the Israelites had liberated all the divine sparks which are referred to as the host of Israel. Israel had gathered up all the holiness that was to be found in Egypt. That is why they were able to leave earlier than they had been told before – they had completed the purpose of the presence in Egypt.<br>Psalm 114 is a psalm about the splitting of the Red Sea, and later the Jordan River when the people entered the land of Canaan. The psalmist asks: <b>“What alarmed you that you fled?”</b> According to one Midrash the sea fled when it saw the casket of Joseph which the Israelites had taken out of Egypt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">287</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shochar Tov</i> <b>“O Lord in the presence of the Adonai” </b>– another Midrash teaches that the sea refused to split until God Himself appeared.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">288</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yalkut Shimoni Bishalach, 234</i> But in <i>Dayyenu</i> we say “If God had split the sea but not taken us through it on dry land, it would have been enough for us.” This implies that the sea spit immediately. However, it was still covered with mud and not completely dry. The Holy one wanted to show through the Exodus a completely different type of act of creation, that there would not remain even a drop of water when the Israelites passed through the sea, and this could not happen until God appeared in all His glory; only then could the people of Israel pass through the sea ‘on dry land.’<br>Also, normally the sea floor is full of high and low places. But when God appeared at the sea, God not only dried up the sea but flattened the sea bed so that the people could easily walk through the sea from one side to the other. Israel was also able to drink water from the sea – the water that spurt forth was fresh and sweet – it came forth from fountains deep beneath the earth. There was also all types of delicious fruit that came from the mountains and hills that was growing on the sea floor so that there was food for them to eat as well."

The question then, is “Who knows the real one,” – not the numerical but the qualitative meaning of God’s oneness. The real One is OUR GOD.

Why is it that the redemption of the firstborn is attributed to the mother’s firstborn and not the father’s firstborn, especially since the father’s firstborn were apparently struck down as well? This is because the loot which the Israelites took in Egypt was given to them as a reward for the righteous women of Israel.

They had seven days to repent because there are seven days in a week. In this way a person’s destiny could change on the same day of the week on which they were born. The Egyptians tried to use their magic to undo these changes but their astrologic influences weakened, and as a result they sank in the sea when they arrived at the Red Sea. So when we ask “Who knows seven,” we answer ‘seven are the days of the week’ because these seven days were a time of repentance.

Each of the tribes is associated with one of the twelve months of the year. Thus, this explains the connection between the twelve tribes and the giving of the Torah. Moses who comes from the third tribe had to be the teacher of Torah which was given in the third month.",
                    "<b>Who knows thirteen?</b> The thirteen attributes of God represent the thirteenth favor which God bestowed upon Israel: He brought them into the land of Israel (and let them build the temple). This is the greatest favor of all – there is nothing higher! For through these favors, the divine presence came to dwell among the people. The land was divided among the twelve tribes (counting Ephraim and Menasheh) plus all of the cities of refuge were given to the tribe of Levi. Thus, there were thirteen portions to the land. These thirteen portions parallel the thirteen attributes of God. There are also thirteen days from Rosh Hodesh Nisan until the eve of Passover. These are days of redemption and are associated with these attributes.",
                    "• <b>The first day of Nisan</b> is Rosh Hodesh, the first day of Nisan, is the day on which the Tabernacle was dedicated and the Holy one dwelled among the people, “In heaven and on earth”",
                    "• <b>The second day</b> <b>of Nisan</b> falls on the same day of the week as Shavuot, the day on which the Torah was given to Israel. It is the day on which we received the two tablets of the covenant.",
                    "• <b>The third day of Nisan</b> falls on the same day that Rosh Hashanah falls that year – it is a day when we recall the three Patriarchs.",
                    "• <b>The fourth day of Nisan</b> falls on the same day as the second day of Rosh Hashanah, the eve of Yom Kippur and the second day of Sukkot, and Simchat Torah – it is associated with the four matriarchs.",
                    "• <b>The fifth day of Nisan</b> falls on the same day of the week as Yom Kippur, the day on which Moses brought down the second set of tablets from Sinai and Israel knew that it had been forgiven for worshipping the golden calf.",
                    "• <b>The sixth day of Nisan</b> falls on the same day of the week as Purim. According to the sages, it was on Purim that the Jewish people accepted the Torah freely<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">300</sup><i class=\"footnote\">BT Shabbat 88a</i> - this is the day on which they accepted the oral Torah as well as the written Torah (and so it is connected with the six volumes of the Mishnah.)",
                    "• <b>The seventh day of Nisan</b> falls on the same day of the week as the eve of Passover. Since the people had to come to the temple to offer the Passover sacrifice they had to undergo a process of purification beforehand which involved purification on the third and seventh day. Thus it took the seven days of the week to purify themselves.",
                    "• <b>The eighth day of Nisan </b>falls on the same day as the Eve of Shavuot and the end of the counting of the Omer. We must count seven ‘clean weeks’ just as a woman must count seven clean days before going to the Mikvah to immerse herself. Also after giving birth to a son, the mother must count seven days of impurity. On the eighth day the circumcision takes place! The eighth day, then is a day of great gladness and rejoicing.",
                    "• <b>The ninth day of Nisan </b>is associated with the redemption. Even though the people were freed from servitude on Rosh Hashanah they still could not leave Egypt. The first to the ninth day of Nisan were like the nine months of pregnancy, and the redemption began on the tenth when they were told to put aside the Passover offering.",
                    "• <b>The tenth day of Nisan </b>falls on the same day of the week as the second day of Shavuot. There are those who say that the ten commandments were given not on the sixth but the seventh day of Sivan (the second day of the holiday). Thus the tenth day is also associated with the Ten Commandments.",
                    "• <b>The eleventh day of Nisan </b>is the day on which the astrological sign of the lamb fell from favor. Thus there were only eleven astrological signs",
                    "• <b>The twelfth day of Nisan </b>was the day on which each of the princes of Israel brought gifts to the Tabernacle - and it was considered to be a festive day. It is connected with the twelve tribes.",
                    "• <b>The thirteenth day of Nisan </b>has many associations. There are thirteen principles of interpretation in the Torah, thirteen is the age of Bar Mitzvah, and there are thirteen letters in the Hebrew names of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. The word <i>echad</i>, One, is equal to thirteen in <i>gematriah</i>. Each of the thirteen principles of interpretations are connected with the names of the Patriarchs, and one who breaks the laws is lashed thirty nine times which is three times thirteen – for the three patriarchs. Passover could not occur until after the thirteenth day – just as a Bar Mitzvah must wait until his thirteenth birthday to be called to the Torah."
