                "<b>Upon returning from synagogue</b> one should arrange one's table in the manner of freedom as we shall explain. One should not sit down at the table until after dark so that one can be certain that it is the time when one is permitted to eat matzah, as it is written, \"In the evening you shall eat matzot.\"<br>Even the poor should not drink less than four cups of wine; they should eat and drink while reclining. Scripture alludes to this in the verse: \"When Pharaoh let the people go…So God led <i>(vayasev)</i> the people round about…\"  When they were redeemed they ate in the \"round-about\" fashion.<br>The optimal way to fulfill the mitzvah of drinking wine is to drink red wine as a reminder of the blood they placed on their lintel and doorposts in Egypt. If their hands are cleaned they may sit at the table and recite Kiddush. Most people have the custom of checking their hands beforehand and then washing them. But if their hands were already clean, there is no reason to wash them and recite al netilat yadaim, the blessing for washing. For this recitation of the blessing is not for eating but for drinking after Kiddush. We have a tradition that one who performs the ritual of \"washing\" before fruit is being presumptuous.<br>There are many reasons given for the four cups of wine at the Seder. The four cups are said to allude to the four terms of redemption mentioned in Parshat Va-era (Exodus 6:6): \"Say, therefore, to the children of Israel: I am the Lord. I will free you from the labors of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and through extraordinary chastisements. I will take you to be my people and I will be your God.\" The four cups are alluded to in the words: hotzeiti (I will free you), hitzalti (I will deliver you), ga'alti (I will redeem you) and lakahti (I will take you).\"<br>There are those who say that the four cups refer to the butler's dream regarding to Pharaoh: \"Pharaoh's cup was in my hand;\" \"I pressed them into Pharaoh's cup;\" \"placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand;\" \"you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand.\" (Genesis 40:9-13)<br>Some say that the four cups stand for the four kingdoms, and others, four cups of vengeance which God will pour out on the nations, \"Thus said the Lord, the God of Israel, to  me: Take from My hand this cup of wine - of wrath - and make all the nations  to whom I send you drink it. Let them drink and retch and act crazy because of the sword that I am sending among them.\" (Jer. 25:15-16) \"Babylon was a golden cup in the Lords hand. It made the whole earth drunk…\" (Jer. 51:7) \"There is a cup in the Lord's hand with foaming wine fully mixed from this He pours. All the nations of the earth drink, draining it to the very dregs.\" (Psalms 75:9) \"He will rain down upon the wicked blazing coals and sulfur, a scorching wind shall be their lot (kosam).\" (Psalm 11:6)<br>They also allude to four cups of consolation: \"The Lord is my allotted share and portion (kosi); You control my fate.\" (Psalm 16:5) \"You shall anoint my head with oil; My cup overflows. (Psalm 23:5) \"I will raise the cup of deliverances and invoke the name of the Lord.\" (Psalm 116:13)  This last verse speaks of two cups: one for the coming of the Messiah and the other for the resurrection.<br>There are those who wonder why we don’t recite a blessing for the mitzvah of the four cups just as we recite for maror.   We only recite a blessing over a mitzvah that is performed at one time, and without interruption. Since the drinking of the four cups of wine are one commandment which is performed on four occasions with interruptions between them, we do not recite a blessing for this mitzvah. Natronai Gaon  writes that the four cups of Seder night are a single mitzvah; if one does not drink all of them, one has not fulfilled his obligation and he deserves lashes, according to the sages.<br>The statement, \"Even the poor must not eat until he does so leaning,\" is a reference to a poor person who normally does not lean leisurely when he eats. Certainly the same applies to a wealthy person who usually leans on a fine couch.  One must lean on the left side. Leaning on the right side is not considered 'leaning,' lest his throat become closed . A woman does not need to lean because she lives under the authority of her husband.  But if she is a woman of high status, she should lean. Similarly, a widow or a divorcee who does not live under the authority of another should lean.<br>A son who lives in his father's house, even if his father is also his teacher, should lean. A student at the table of his master teacher does not lean unless his teacher gives him permission. The reason that he may lean at his father's table, but not at his teacher's table, is that his father would forgo the honor nor would he be harsh with him while a teacher should not forgo the honor due to him. A servant at his master's table should lean. The Avi Ezri   writes that in our time when it is not the custom to lean at the table, it is not necessary to lean during the Seder either.",
                "We prepare a plate for the Seder containing two cooked foods, three matzot, a variety of vegetables, and <i>haroset</i>. The two cooked foods: one of them should be roasted as a reminder of the Passover offering and one should be cooked as a reminder of the hagigah, the festive offering, which was consumed before the Passover offering so that the Passover offering would be consumed when one already had sufficient to eat. The following verse: \"You shall not break a bone of it,\" (Ex. 12:46) is interpreted to mean that if he was ravenously hungry when he ate the Passover offering, he might be suspected of breaking the bones of the offering.<br>This is how the commandment was fulfilled in the time of the Holy Temple: first they would break the Passover offering, reciting over it, 'Praised are you Adonai our God…who command us concerning the eating of the Passover offering.'  Each person would then eat at least an olive's amount of  the meat from it. Afterwards they would bring the Festive offering, reciting the blessing, \"who commanded us regarding the eating of the offering.\" When they completed eating the Festive offering, they would bring the Passover offering back and eat it after having satisfied themselves (with the other offering).<br>When the Fourteenth of Nisan fell on a Shabbat, it was only necessary to eat the Passover offering and not the cooked offering for the Festive offering, since the Festive offering does not take precedence over the observance of the Sabbath.  The Jerusalem Talmud adds that the two portions (for the Seder plate) should be the shoulder and an egg. The egg symbolizes compassion for the redemption that God provides, and the shoulder, symbolizes, 'God provides redemption through God's exalted hand.<br>Customarily there are two vegetables on the Seder plate. One is karpas. When one inverts the letters of karpas, it spells samekh parekh. The letter samekh refers to the sixty tens of thousands of Israelites who were enslaved. And the word parekh means oppressed. The other vegetable is hazeret which is also called <i>hasa</i>.   <i>Hasa</i> is an allusion to the Holy One who has mercy (has) upon us. According to the sages, the haroset is a reminder of the clay from which they made the bricks when the Egyptians enslaved the Israelites. It is made from different types of sweet and tart fruits as well as spices that look like the straw used in the making of bricks. We put apples in as a reminder of the verse in scripture, \"beneath an apple tree I aroused you.\" (Song of Songs 8:5)  Nuts are a reminder of the verse, \"I went down to the garden of nuts.\" (Song 6:11) Figs are an allusion of the verse, \"The fig tree puts forth her green figs.\" (Song 2:13) Dates are an allusion to the verse, \"your stature is like a palm tree\" (Song 7:8). Spices like cinnamon are a reminder of the straw used in the making of bricks.",
                "The Rif  asks: How does a person conduct Seder in two or three different households?  He begins in his own house by reciting the blessings and the Haggadah up to the meal. He should then eat the meal, concluding with the Birkat HaMazon. He can then to each household, reciting Kiddush and a letting the members of the household drink the wine.  He then recites the Haggadah. They may eat the karpas and the matzah (when he says the blessing) but he does not eat with the members of the household since he has already concluded his meal with the Afikomen. They recite the Birkat HaMazon, and then he goes on to the next household. He does this at each house he visits.<br>Even though the rule is that a person should not recite a blessing for food for someone if he is not also eating the food, the blessing over the matzah and the Kiddush are different. He can recite these blessings without eating or drinking because these foods are obligatory on Seder night. Therefore, he can recite the blessing for someone else even though he is not benefiting from the blessing. However the Birkat HaMazon is different since he has not tasted any of the food. Once he has eaten the Afikomen and recited the Birkat HaMazon in his own house, he cannot eat anything else so they must recite the grace after meals for themselves. This is based on the principle, Ayn maftirin ha-Pesah Afikomen, \"one may not partake of any deserts after the Pesah offering.\"  (Mishnah Pesahim)  After leading the Seder in the other households, he should return to his own house and complete the evening by reciting Hallel and drinking the fourth cup of wine.<br>If he prefers, he may go to the other households first, recite the blessings without eating or drinking with them, and then return to his house and begin all over again with the Kiddush. It is up to him to do as he wishes.  He is not permitted to begin in his own household and recite the Seder up to ga'al yisrael (before the meal), recite the blessing over the matzah, and then go to the other households, returning to his own home to have his meal.<br>It is prohibited to leave one's meal to go to another home, even if one leaves an elderly or a sick person at home. One can only leave one's household on Seder night to perform a commandment such as rejoicing with a newly married couple. It goes without saying that helping those who are illiterate to fulfill the commandments of Seder night is also a  commandment. The difference is that rejoicing with the bride and groom is a transient commandment. Therefore it permissible to leave the Seder table to participate in this mitzvah by greeting them.  Helping the illiterate to fulfill the commandments of Seder night, on the other hand, is not transient; he can finish his own meal or go earlier help these families fulfill the commandments of this evening.<br>The Baal HaItur   comments that he may not recite the blessing over the vegetables (karpas) since he cannot eat with them.  He can only recite the blessing over the matzah and the maror. However, he may follow the approach of Rav Hisda, who would take hazeret (which can also be used for maror), recite the blessing over vegetables as well as the blessing for the maror at the beginning of the Seder, and when he reached the place in the Seder when one eats the maror, he would do so without reciting the blessing again.<br>The Rosh  disagreed with this approach and argued that since the sages decreed that we should eat the karpas so that children would notice it and ask questions, it is to be considered no different than the blessing for the matzah and it can be recited by the Seder leader even if he is not eating the greens.<br>The Ri'af's  statement that \"the participants must recite the Birkat HaMazon by themselves\" is a law for those who can recite the Birkat HaMazon. If there is no one who can lead it, Rabbi Amram Gaon writes that there is no decree that the leader must lead them so that they can fulfill their obligation. If he were to do so, he could no longer drink the fourth cup of wine in his house.<br>The Rosh writes that if even if the participants at the Seder do not know how to recite the Birkat HaMazon, the leader should lead them in it, having them repeat it word for word after him like a child who repeats Hallel and repeats it after the leader. This is not considered as if he recited God's name unnecessarily.<br>Rabbi Yaakov, son of the Rosh  writes that it is possible that the leader can also recite the Birkat HaMazon for the participants and thereby fulfill their obligation. Since it is an obligation to eat matzah and so the leader can recite the blessing and have the participants answer Amen, so too, the Grace after meal can be recited on their behalf and thereby fulfill their obligation. After all, the sages decreed the obligation of four cups of wine, one of them at the end of the Birkat HaMazon, so they have a special obligation to recite the Birkat HaMazon so that they can drink the fourth cup of wine.<br>It seems to me that Rabbi Yaakov son of the Rosh is incorrect, since we learn in the Jerusalem Talmud (Berachot): \"Even if a person is exempt from a commandment, he may fulfill another person's obligation except in the case of the Birkat HaMazon.\" The Talmud then asks, don’t we say that one who is exempt from a commandment cannot help fulfill another person's obligation. Rather the statement in the Talmud should have been if he is obligated to perform this commandment but has already fulfilled his obligation, he can still help others fulfill their obligation except in the case of the Birkat HaMazon, as it is written: You shall eat, and be satisfied and bless.\" This  means that one who ate should recite the Birkat HaMazon (and not one who didn’t eat). It seems to me, therefore, that the Rosh is correct in this matter.<br>When everything is prepared, he should pour the first cup of wine for each participant, reciting the blessing for the wine first, then the blessing sanctifying the day,  and then the sheheyanu, for having reached this day. We do not say a blessing, \"Who performed miracles for our ancestors,\" because the last blessing of the Maggid, \"Who redeemed us and our ancestors from Egypt…Blessed are you Adonai, who has redeemed Israel\" serves as a blessing for giving thanks for the miracles of Passover. This blessing is more appropriate because it more specific in referring to the Exodus. Then everyone drinks the cup of wine while leaning.",
                "If Passover falls on Shabbat, one says Vayekhulu first, (Genesis 2:1-3) then the blessing over the wine, followed by the blessing sanctifying the day. In the second blessing, on Shabbat we say \"You have caused us to inherit the Sabbath and your holy festivals with love and favor.\" The commandment to rejoice on the festival is explicitly stated. The commandment to rejoice is alluded to in the verse: \"On your joyous occasions and your festivals.\"  (Numbers 10:10)  the Midrash says that \"your joyous occasions,\" is a reference to the Sabbaths. We find the language of inheritance in connection with the Sabbath, as it is written, \"The people of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, observing the Sabbath day throughout the generations as a covenant for all times.\"  (Exodus 31:16) That is why we say, \"You cause us to inherit.\" Finally one concludes the blessing by saying, \"Praised are you who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the sacred seasons. Then one recites the she-heheyanu and one drinks the wine.",
                "If Passover falls at the conclusion of the Sabbath, we recite the blessings which are referred to in the acrostic, YKNH\"Z, yayin (wine), kiddush (sanctifying the day), ner (candle, or the blessing for fire), havdalah (the blessing marking the separation between Shabbat and the following day), z'man (she-heheyanu or the blessing marking the specialness of the moment). In the havdalah blessing we say \"between the holiness of the Sabbath and the holiness of the festival.\" There is separation between the 'heavy' and 'light' holiness, similar to what we find in scripture: \"the curtain (parokhet)  shall serve as a partition between the holy and the holy of holies.\" (Exodus 26:33) Rabbi Ephraim asks why we say, \"Between the seventh day and the six days of creation You have made a separation and You have sanctified, You have sanctified Your people, Israel, with Your holiness, \" in the havdalah blessing. We say this after we have already mentioned, \"Between the holiness of the Sabbath to the holiness of the festival You have made a separation.\" The phrase is neither an introduction nor is it a summary of the blessing. Rabbeinu Tam  answers this question: we are taught in chapter 10 of the Talmud Pesahim, that one who abbreviates the havdalah blessing should not have less than three havdalot (expressions of separation) and one should not add more than seven. The sages wanted to mention seven havdalot so they added Yom Tov, the festival, after Shabbat since this is the main theme of the passage.<br>These are the seven separations: (1) between the sacred and the profane; (2) between light and darkness; (3) between Israel and the gentiles; (4) between the Sabbath and the six days of creation. This counts as four, however, the fourth is not included in the number since we have already mentioned between the sacred and the profane which is a more general way of saying the same thing as, \"between the Sabbath and the six days of creation.\" Therefore, there are only three havdalot up to here!\" (4) Between the holiness of the Sabbath and the holiness of the festival; since preparation of food is allowed on the festival there is a distinction between it and the Sabbath; (5) Between the seventh day and the other six days of creation - this is a reference to the last day of the festival which is separate from the intermediate days of the festival; (6) you have separated (7) and you have sanctified your people Israel through your holiness; this refers to the two separations that make up the people of Israel: between the Kohanim and the Levites, and between the Levites the people of Israel. The blessing then ends with a brief conclusion: \"who distinguishes the holy from the holy.\"<br>One then recites the sh-heheyanu. One does not smell spices as one normally does during the havdalah service since the leisure (menuchah) of the festival brings leisure to the soul in place of the spices which one smells at the conclusion of the Sabbath."

                "<i>Hands are washed in preparation to the handling of food. The Talmud states that when a food is dipped in liquid, hands are to be washed first as a sign of ritual purity (Pesahim 115a). There are different customs regarding who should wash their hands before partaking of the greens.  In some homes the person conducting the Seder washes before handing out the greens while in other homes all the participants wash their hands before handling the greens. In the Ashkenazic tradition no blessing is recited. The blessing for washing hands is said only before eating bread.</i> <br>Following Kiddush, one washes one's hands in preparation for karpas, vegetables dipped in liquid, even though one is not about to eat unleavened bread. Whenever one eats something that is dipped in liquid, one must was one's hands since one's hands may become moist and one might inadvertently touch something and contract impurity. We have explained that it is good to find a reason for washing one's hands prior to this. It need not be after Kiddush since we are not careful regarding impurity today. "

                "One takes the karpas and dips it in vinegar or in the haroset in order to kill the worms that are sometimes found in the vegetables. One then recites the blessing borei peri ha-adamah. Rabbeinu Tam and Rashbam instructed their students to do the first dipping in vinegar. This was based on the statement in the Mishnah, \"They then set it before him. He dips the lettuce before he has reached the after course of bread. They set before him matzah, lettuce (hazeret) and haroset, and two side dishes, even though haroset is not compulsory.\" (Mishnah Pesahim 10:2) The Mishnah does not mention haroset until the second dipping, proving that we do not dip in the haroset for the first dipping.  Rabbeinu Yona explains that the first dipping is not considered obligatory. Rather it is performed as a way of calling attention to the Seder. Since we do not dip vegetables in haroset all year long, the reason for this practice cannot be to prevent kafa.  Therefore it is not our custom to eat the lettuce (hazeret) without haroset, as we do all year long. Since the second dipping is regarded as a mitzvah, the sages were more careful in its performance. <br>Hai Gaon explains that kafa is Aramaic from the word kafui (coagulation); it refers to a gaseousness which strikes the intestines from certain types of food. Haroset is a type of medicine which prevents the gaseousness.<br>We do not recite a blessing for haroset even though it is considered a commandment, because  haroset is secondary to the primary food, the lettuce or the maror. We learn, \"Any time we have two foods, we recite the blessing on the primary food and not the secondary food. We recite al achilat maror and not borai peri ha-adamah for the second dipping since we already recited this blessing earlier in the Seder and the reading of the Haggadah is not considered to be an interruption between the two acts. ",
                "However it is necessary to recite the blessing for the washing of the hands again because it is considered an interruption for the washing and his hands may have inadvertently touched something impure. <br>It is not necessary to recite the concluding blessing borei nefashot for the karpas since the reading of the Haggadah is not considered an interruption. It is also not necessary after eating the maror to recite this blessing since the commandment is to eat the matzah and the maror together, as scripture, \"Matzah and maror they shall eat it.\" It is considered to be part of the meal, and it is not necessary to recite borei peri ha-adamah again during the meal. The vegetables which we dip at the beginning of the Seder are meant to make the children curious since we normally don’t dip vegetables prior to the meal.<br> If one does not have other vegetables - and only has maror - should begin the Seder by reciting two blessings, al achilat maror and borei peri ha-adamah when he eats and dips the maror in place of the karpas. He should then dip it in the haroset and eat an olives size of it. When he completes the reading of the Haggadah and recites the blessing over the matzah, he should eat the maror again, this time without a blessing."

                "<br>After eating the karpas, one breaks one of the three matzot, placing half between the two whole matzot and wrapping half of it in a cloth, as a reminder of the verse: \"So the people took the dough before it was leavened, their kneading  bowls wrapped in their cloaks upon their shoulders.\" (Exodus 12:34) It is used for the Afikomen which is eaten later as a reminder of the Passover offering, which must be consumed when we are already sated by the meal.  Why do we break the matzah before the reading of the Haggadah? So that when we make the declaration, \"This is the bread of affliction,\" we can do so over a broken piece of matzah. The Talmud Pesahim states, \"Just as it is the way of the poor to break bread and put some away for later, so too here, we break the matzah and put away a piece for later.\"",
                "The Rif  asks, What should one who only has an olives-worth of guarded matzah (shmurah matzah) do? He should first eat regular matzah first when he recites the motzi and afterwards, at the end of the meal (when he eats the Afikomen) should eat the olives-worth  of guarded matzah, reciting the blessing \"for the commandment of eating matzah\" (al akhilat matzah). One then makes a sandwich with the maror and the matzah without a blessing.<br>The Rif's explanation surprised the Rosh,  who wonders, if we wait until the end of the seder to say al akhilat matzah over the guarded matzah, how could one then eat the sandwich with a regular piece of matzah since it would remove the taste of the guarded (shmurah) matzah from one's mouth?  According to the Rif's explanation  it would have made more sense to simply omit the sandwich since it is only a remembrance of the Passover offering which was eaten together with matzah and maror.<br>This is what the Rambam and Rabbeinu Yona  suggest: one should recite the blessing for the eating of matzah at the end of the meal, and one should not eat anything after it. The Ittur  suggests that one should recite both blessings, hamotzi and al akhilat matzah, and then eat the regular (non-guarded) matzah, and then eat the shmurah matzah at the end of the meal as the Afikomen without a blessing.<br>The Rosh suggests that one should begin with the shmurah matzah, after reciting both blessings, so that one eats the shmurah matzah 'with an appetite' and that one need not worry about eating non-guarded matzah after it."

                    "<b>One begins the reading of the Haggadah.</b> The Rif wonders why one doesn’t recite a blessing for the reading of the Haggadah just as one recites a blessing for the reading of the Megillah.  Surely the telling of the story of Passover is a positive commandment as we learn: \"You shall tell your child on that day etc.\" (Exodus 12:8)<br>He explains that a blessing for telling the story is unnecessary since by saying in the Kiddush, \"A remembrance for the exodus from Egypt,\" he fulfills his obligation of saying a special blessing. The Rashba  offers another explanation for why a special blessing is not said for the telling of the Passover story. One does not need to say a blessing for a mitzvah for which there is no minimum in its performance. A simple statement (\"God took us out of Egypt\") would suffice in the telling of the story of the Exodus, though we do say \"whoever tells the story at length is praiseworthy.\"<br>This text is called the Haggadah because of the verse,  \"You shall tell (v'higadita) your child on that day etc.\" (Exodus 12:8).  Some say that the name comes from the Hebrew word for drawing the heart, or inspiring, and this seems correct to me, as in the verse, \"O Lord, open up my lips; that my mouth may declare (yagid) your praise.\" (Ps. 51:17) The sages interpreted yagid to mean, \"my mouth shall draw your praise.\" That is, everything derives from the intention of the heart. In human books, wonders and awesome acts arise from the natural order of the world, inspiring love, joy and spiritual pleasure. Yet who has heard such things as the Exodus without trembling? The author of the Kuzari writes:<br>\"The facts are yet more startling! The Israelites lived in Egypt as slaves, 600,000 men above the age of twenty, the descendents of the twelve tribes. Not one of them had separated or emigrated to another country, nor was there a stranger among them. They looked forward to the promise given to their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that the land of Israel should be their inheritance. At that time it was in the power of seven mighty and prosperous nations, while the Israelites groaned in the depths of misery under the bondage of Pharaoh, who caused the Israelites to be put to death, lest they should increase in number. But God sent Moses and Aaron, two weak men, and they advanced before the mighty Pharaoh, with signs and miracles and changed the course of nature. Pharaoh did not get away from them, nor harm them, neither could he protect himself from the ten plagues which befell the Egyptians, affecting the streams, land, air, plants, animals, bodies and even their souls; for in one moment at midnight, died the most precious and most beloved members of their houses, the first-born males. There was no dwelling without dead, except the houses of the Israelites. All these plagues were preceded by warnings and menaces, and their cessation was signaled in the same manner, proving that they were ordained by God, who does what He wills and when He wills it, and they were not ordinary natural phenomena, nor were they wrought by constellations or accidents. The Israelites left the country of Pharaoh's bondage by the command of God, the same night at the same moment as the first born died…\"<br>Whoever allows such matters to enter their heart with full intentionality will be inspired, not like someone who reads ordinary history books, which have no intention of bringing us closer to the Creator. This is the meaning of the word Haggadah, it is that which draws the heart of those who hear these matters to complete faith. ",
                    "When the Seder leader recites Ha lachma anya, he lifts the platter containing the three matzot and the other ritual foods in order to delight the children. They remove it from the table in order to cause the children to ask Mah Nishtana, \"why is this night different?\" On all other nights we eat whatever is placed before on us on the plate but tonight the plate has been removed from the table! As we find in the Talmud Ketubot (chapter 5):  'Abaye was sitting in the presence of Rabbah. When he saw that they lifted the table , he asked \"How can we eat what has been taken away?\" Rabbah said, \"We have been exempted from saying Mah Nishtana\"' The Rashbam  explains that their tables were small (more like trays) and could easily be removed while our tables are large and not easily movable. Instead, we remove a platter or a plate containing three matzot, the maror, and the two cooked foods can be food; this considered to be sufficient. ",
                    "<b><i>Ha lachma anya</i>:</b> Our ancestors ate bread like this in Egypt. Did our ancestors eat matzah in Egypt? Doesn’t scripture state, \"And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had taken out of Egypt for it was not leavened since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay; nor had they prepared provisions for themselves.\" (Exodus 12:39) So they did not have unleavened bread until after they left Egypt, Isaac Abarbanel  explains in his commentary, that when the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt toiling with hard labor, the Egyptians gave them matzah to eat which was hard to digest, just as employers often give their employees food that will not be digested quickly today.

At the very least, this year we are still slaves here but next year we may be free.  This is a type of prayer: 'May it be God,s will that the Holy one fulfill His promise and oath to redeem us from our exile so that we will merit the privilege of offering the Passover sacrifice in Jerusalem next year!'

                    "<b>What does the wise child ask? What are these testimonies, statutes and judgments which the Lord our God commanded us:</b> This passage is found in Parshat Va-etchanan (Deut. 6:20) It continues: \"You shall say to your children: 'We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and the Lord freed us  from Egypt with a mighty hand.  The Lord performed before our eyes marvelous and awesome signs and portents in Egypt against Pharaoh and all his household.'\" (Deut. 6: 21-22) This was the answer to the wise child. There is no doubt that a wise person is praised for his intellect, and his choice of words are a reflection of his intellect. In the words of Proverbs, 25:11: \"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.\" This means that the wise person, when he asks a question or makes a statement does not repeat himself; each word deals with a separate matter and he chooses his words wisely.<br>This is the intent of the wise child's question. When he asks about \"these testimonies, statutes and judgments,\" he understands that there are different types of commandments regarding the Festival and Passover offering. For instance, we learn that the offering must be a male lamb; only those appointed to the offering were allowed to eat it; it had to be roasted; and it had to be consumed by midnight, as Scripture says, \"This is the law of Passover.\" (Ex. 12:43) The wise child knows that these details are testimonies that teach us important matters about the reason for the offering. They testify to the events of the Exodus from Egypt. But he also asks regarding the statutes  and judgments relating to the Passover offering; for example, \"do not break the bones of the offering\" and other details. One of the central statutes is the commandment to eat the Passover offering when one is already satiated from the festive meal, at the end of the meal, rather than when one normally eats one's favorite dish at the beginning of the meal. What purpose is there in eating delicacies on a full stomach and he is no longer able to eat any more? So you should explain to him, \"You shall instruct him…no dessert (Afikomen) ought to be set before him after the Passover offering.\" That is, do not say, afiku mahn,  \"bring out the sweets\" after the meal in order to remove the taste of meat from his mouth at the conclusion of the meal. That is why the Afikomen is delayed to the end of the meal.  We can now explain the wise child's insightful question. We now eat an olives-size of sh'murah matzah at the end of the meal as a reminder of the Passover offering.<br>We now understand why the wise child asks this question the way he does. He sees that members of his household and those appointed to eat their Passover offering sitting together. Each is given only a bit to eat of the offering at the end of the meal. He also sees that they are meticulous about eating it, something that they do not normally do at other times. He asks, \"What are these testimonies and statutes…\" That is, generally it is the custom when people gather to celebrate an occasion with the members of their household, they leave their house afterwards to visit their friends' houses. If it is because of the preciousness of the Passover offering that they gathered, then why don’t they send portions to their neighbors as we do on other occasions. The wise child does not remove himself from the gathering; rather, he says \"which the Lord our God commanded you.\" He says \"you\" because he knows that the commandment was not given to him because he is still a minor. Yet he has already accepted upon himself the yoke of the commandments which is why he says, \"the Lord our God.\"",
                    "<b>So you should explain to him all the laws of Passover, including, \"You shall instruct him…no dessert (Afikomen) ought to be set before him after the Passover offering.\"</b> This answer implies that we are obligated to eat the Passover offering in one gathering and not with others. He will see that since we were appointed to this gathering, we cannot say \"give me my cloak as I wish to go out from here,\" (afiku minai);  we cannot go out from the house as on other festivals. Thus we explain why people don’t eat in their own homes as we do on other festivals but gather in groups to eat the Passover offering.",

Speaking in the manner of a wicked person, he uses the word avodah, implying something that is a burden and troublesome. The wicked child says, \"What is all the trouble with which you bother yourself all year?\" He calls the service of God avodah, labor. Even though we find this word used for the sacrificial rites, we should presume that the wicked child has bad intentions since he removes himself from the community. Therefore you should \"blunt his teeth.\" This means weaken his teeth as in the verse, \"In those days they shall say no more, the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.\" (Jer. 31:28) This means that he sees others eating and he is not able to eat the food. Tell him: \"The Torah was speaking of you when it said, 'It is because of what the Lord did for me,' God did it for me and not for you!\"  If an evil person like you had been in Egypt, he would not have been redeemed.<br> Why do we apply this verse to the wicked child when it is the verse that is applied to the one who does not know to ask?

Rav's interpretation appears here following the explication of \"Because of this (zeh) which the Lord did for me…\" (Ex. 13:8) because the sages taught that one who has abandoned his faith for idolatry is not allowed to partake of the Passover meal, as it is written, \"A stranger may not partake of it.\" Therefore we begin by speaking of the disgrace, that our ancestors worshipped idols, and only when they came closer to their true faith and were circumcised before they left Egypt, only then were they fit to offer the sacrifice and to come close to the service of God. We say it here in order that the children will hear this and will learn a lesson  and not allow their hearts to go astray after vanity, and thus be exiled from the table of their Father in Heaven.<br>It is fitting to mention how their ascent into slavery came about and how they learned the ways of other nations as a result of being dispersed among them as well as their Exodus from Egypt, along with the miracles and wonders God performed there.

The first born then said: 'There is but one way to settle this matter: let us go to Pharaoh, since he is a first-born, who may take pity on himself and let these Hebrews get out of our midst.' They went to Pharaoh and said to him: 'Since Moses has said \"All the first-born shall die,\" and since everything he has predicted concerning the Egyptians has befallen them, rise up and get these Hebrews out of our midst, or else the Egyptian people shall die.' But Pharaoh said to his servants: Get going and beat these cowards until they are humpbacked! And to the first born he said: I have sworn: My life or the life of the Hebrews.

Rabbi Yehudah, however, only brought this acronym to teach us about the number of plagues at the Red Sea. Rabbi Yossi said there were fifty plagues; Rabbi Eliezer said there were two hundred plagues, and Rabbi Akiva said there were two hundred and fifty plagues at the sea. Together they add up to five hundred plagues. Rabbi Yehudah's acronym adds up to five hundred and one; in matters of gematriah we don’t trouble ourselves over differences of just one!<br>Some suggest that the reason that he created this acronym is because of the listing of the plagues in the book of Psalms, which is different from the order in the Torah. Therefore, Rabbi Yehudah created this acronym so that we would know that the order in the Torah is the correct one.<br>Some commentators suggest that this is a reference to the pattern of the plagues: In some plagues, God sends Pharaoh a warning, and in others, there is no warning. The acronym shows us that there is a pattern of three groups of plagues, the first two with a warning and the third in each grouping without a warning. That is why Rabbi Judah groups the plagues together three by three. Pharaoh is warned during the plagues of blood and frogs, while he receives no warning when the plague of lice strikes the land. Wild animals and pestilence contain a warning while boils does not contain a warning. This follows the pattern regarding flogging. When one commits a crime again and again, he is flogged once and twice, each time with a warning. The third time we do not flog him. Rather we put him in a prison, feed him barley bread until his stomach explodes because he is wicked and no longer deserves a warning. Similarly, hail and locust occurred with a warning and darkness without a warning.  Since the final plague stands by itself, it has its own acronym.<br>Another explanation of the division into three groups: the first three plagues were carried out by Aaron. In the second group, wild animals and pestilence were not carried out by Moses or Aaron, and boils was carried out by both of them. The third group of plagues was carried out by Moses. And the final plague, the death of the first-born was carried out by the Holy one so it is in a grouping all by itself.",

The Rokeach  offered a lovely explanation for this controversy. Rabbi Eliezer suggested that the plagues were quadrupled at the Red Sea because each one included all four basic elements of the universe (fire, water, air and earth).  According to Rabbi Akiva, each plague was quintupled based on the four elements plus the movement of the heavenly spheres  that influenced each plague as well."

In the time of the Temple, Hillel would recite the blessing over the matzah and then the blessing over the maror. He would then eat them together since both of them were commandments contained in the Torah and one did not cancel out the other. At this time we recite and eat them separately since matzah is a Torah commandment while maror is only a rabbinic commandment.  When there is a Passover offering, maror is a Torah commandment; in a time when there is no Passover commandment, the maror is only a rabbinic commandment. We cannot eat them together after reciting the blessings since the rabbinic commandment would cancel out the Torah commandment. Therefore, we do them separately and only then do we eat them together; since we have already recited the blessing there is no blessing for the Hillel sandwich.  Ibn Yarhei  writes that the optimal way to perform the commandment is to not have any interruptions between the blessings over the matzah and the making of the Hillel sandwich. In this way the blessing over the matzah and the maror would include the making of the sandwich."

                    "After completing Hallel, one says, \"May all Your creations praise You,\" this is a blessing of song; it ends, \"Praised are you Adonai, Sovereign acclaimed with songs of praise.\" One then recites the blessing for the fourth cup of wine. The leader of the Seder and everyone present reclines while drinking the wine. If one wishes to add a fifth cup, one may do so after reciting Hallel HaGadol (Psalm 136), which begins with Hodu la-adonai ki tov…hodu leilokei elokim. There are twenty six passages in this psalm equal to the twenty six generations that had not yet receive the Torah before it was given to the people of Israel. Despite this, God in His great mercy, continued to sustain these generations. One then recites Nishmat Kol Hai though the blessing at the end of Yishtabah; so says HaRitz Giat. Rabbi Hayim Kohen suggests that one should not say the blessing at the end of Hallel since it is sufficient for there to be a blessing at the end of Yishtabah. It is not necessary to conclude the passages of song and praise twice. This is also the opinion expressed in the Prayer book of Saadia Gaon."

                    "Concerning the blessing after drinking wine, al hagefen v'al p'ri hagefen,  there are those among the Gaonim who hold that one must recite a concluding blessing of thanksgiving after each cup of wine. Our teacher Hai Gaon says: \"It is not fitting for us to recite al hagefen after each of the cups of wine since together they constitute one mitzvah and there is no interruption between them so that a blessing at the end should be sufficient. The Rif suggests that we should recite the concluding blessing (al hagefen) after the first two cups of wine and again after the final two cups of wine. The author of Sefer Hahashalamah explains that the Rif's opinion makes sense since the obligation to recite the blessing over the wine before the meal is not canceled by the wine during the meal and the wine after the meal is not exempted from a blessing by the wine during the meal. The reason for this is the purpose of the wine is different. The wine in the meal is for serving (lisharot) while the wine before and after the meal is for the drinking (lishtot). Since the wine lishtot is more important than the wine lisharot, the wine that is drunk during the meal does not divide the first two cups from the second two cups of wine in the Seder, and a blessing can be recited at the end of the Seder for all four cups of wine."
