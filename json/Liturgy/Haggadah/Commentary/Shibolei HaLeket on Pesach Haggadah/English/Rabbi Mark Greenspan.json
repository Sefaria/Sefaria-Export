Oni has the same root as the word oneh, to answer or respond. Explanation: the reading of the Haggadah and the recitation of Hallel over the eating of the meal.<br>Another Interpretation: Just as it is the practice of a poor man to eat only part of a loaf so too we recite this declaration over a broken piece of matzah.<br><b>Explanation:</b> We recite the Motzi over a broken piece of matzah as we shall explain…<br>Another Interpretation. Just as a poor person kneads the dough and his wife bakes it, so too, it is the custom for one person to knead the dough and another to bake it (in order to finish within the prescribed time.)<br><b>Explanation:</b> Since the poor person has no one to help him, he makes bread along with his spouse, so on Passover it is customary for even the rich person to do so before Passover so that the dough does not become chametz.<br>There are those who explain it differently: Why is matzah called <i>lechem oni</i>? Since it is baked according to the measure of the sacrifice which was offered by a poor person which is an Omer or one tenth of an eyfah as it is explained in Leviticus 5:11<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But if his means suffice not for two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering. And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial-part thereof, and make it smoke on the altar, upon the offerings of the Lord made by fire; it is a sin-offering. </i>. This is the offering of the poorest of the poor.",

Since every person has an obligation to eat matzah on the first night of Pesach, therefore we invite anyone who does not have.<br><b>There are those who explain it this way:</b> Do people really open their door on the eve of Passover and invite the needy? This is surprising! Rather it means: “Anyone who has fasted on the eve of Passover in order to increase his desire for matzah, come and eat…as in the case of Rava who used to drink extra wine on the eve of Passover in order to increase his appetite<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pesachim 107b</i>.

                    "<b>All who are needy come and celebrate the Pesach: </b>Rabbi Yeshiah said we do not say this statement since we do not eat the Pesach offering anymore on the eve of Passover. Even if we did we could not invite anyone to join us since they have to be assigned to the group before hand as the sages have explained.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Benjamin said</b> that we don’t have to worry about taking it out of the <i>Haggadah</i> since we are inviting one another (at the table) to join in the Passover meal. Certainly this was originally said before the <i>Pesach</i> offering was sacrificed, and it was included in the Haggadah as a reminder. Similarly we explain the Pesach in Rabban Gamliel’s statement even though we no longer have the offering. Similarly we make a sandwich as a reminder of the offering and the <i>Afikomen</i> is also in place of the <i>Pesach</i> offering. We also place a bone on the Seder plate. It is appropriate therefore for us to explain why we do all these things.<br>Actually in this Paragraph we mention all three items, Pesach, Matzah and Maror.<br><b>This is the bread of affliction</b> – <i>Matzah</i><br><b>All who are hungry come and eat</b> – This is a reference to the maror since there is nothing more bitter in life than hunger and poverty.<br><b>All who are need come (join in) the Pesach </b>– The Passover offering.<br>Concerning these three items the Torah says: Exodus 13:8 “And thou shall tell your son in that day, saying: It is because of this which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.” The Haggadah explains, ““It is because of this” means when matzah and maror were in front of you.” In the time of the Temple they would say “When matzah maror and pesach were in front of you.” ",
                    "Another explanation: everyone should act like a poor person on Pesach. No one should say I am rich enough to buy my own Pesach offering and I will eat it by myself, since it says gather to you and take a sheep for YOUR Family. (Exodus 12:21)...",
                    "<b> Now we are here, next year in the land of Israel; now we are slaves next year in the land of Israel free</b>: Having mentioned the Pesach offering we now offer words of comfort for the reader of the Haggadah. Even though we are in the exile and enslaved so that we can’t offer the Pesach sacrifice, we know that that the Omnipresent has promised to take us out of this exile and to bring us back to the land of Israel. May it be God’s will to fulfill His promise this year that we make next years offering in Jerusalem!",

Since people spoke Aramaic in Jerusalem, it was considered the language of rejoicing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That way everyone would understand and could rejoice.</i>. Another explanation: We recite this invitation in Aramaic because of the evil spirits. They only understand Hebrew and by beginning in Aramaic they will not know what we are doing. When we say all who are hungry, we do so in Aramaic so they will not gather together and mess up the meal. There are six characteristics of evil spirits. Three of them make them like angels and three like mortals: They speak Hebrew like angels. If we read the passage in Hebrew they would understand!<br><b>Rabbi Judah my brother taught</b> we say this passage in Aramaic because this is the colloquial language which everyone spoke, and it was decreed that we say this in Babylonia. IT was said in the common language so women and children would understand it. We also said it to give people another reason to ask questions and free us from the obligation of saying Mah Nishtanah, How is this night different from all other night.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Benjamin explains it differently</b>: Why do we recite this in Aramaic? Because of the exposition in Lamentations Rabba: (Lamentations 1:3 “Judah was exiled because of <i>Oni</i> (affliction): Israel was not exiled to Babylonia until they ate Chametz on Passover, as it said “Judah was exiled because of (lechem) Oni.” – Therefore we recite this passage in Aramaic to reveal the sin to our children that caused us to be in exile so that we can avoid it. In effect we are saying, “This is the bread which our ancestors ate when they left Egypt.” Because of it we were exiled – therefore we must be cautious (in fulfilling this mitzvah). Then we remind people all who are hungry make sure you eat only matzah! And conclude now we are here - that is because of our sins – May it be your will to bring back your redeemed ones since we no longer have this sin to prevent us from returning to the land of Israel. We conclude this passage in Hebrew since we are talking about redemption from slavery to freedom. We say it in Hebrew so the Angels will understand. We are taught that one should never petition God in Aramaic since the angels do not understand this language!"

That is, first we speak about the Exodus from Egypt in the past and then we speak about the future as we have explained.

It seems to me that we are meant to read this passage in this way: “Just as we eat matzah and maror so may we celebrate future holidays in peace and free from the nations so that we can fulfill the commandments appropriate to each festival with noting to prevent us just as nothing is preventing us right now.. Furthermore, may we reach and may we be worthy of this festival rejoicing in the rebuilding of your Temple and the renewal of your holy house.”<br>The proof of this explanation is in the expression, “and there we will eat the <i>Pesach </i>offering and the sacrificial offerings.” This can only be a reference to Pesach. My brother, Benjamin, of blessed memory explained that  “forthcoming holidays and festivals” is a reference to <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, <i>Yom Kippur </i>and <i>Sukkot</i> and it follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer who said in <i>Talmud Rosh Hashanah </i>(11a) in “<i>Nisan </i>we were redeemed and in <i>Tishri</i> we will be redeemed in the future.” That is why we mention both the <i>Regalim</i>, festivals, and <i>Mo’adim,</i> holidays<i>. Mo’adim</i> is a reference to<i> Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur</i> as it says, “These are the holidays of the <i>Adonai</i>” (Leviticus 23:4) and <i>Regalim</i> which is plural is a reference to <i>Sukkot and Shemini Atzeret</i> which is a holiday unto itself. And there we will eat <i>Zevachim</i> and <i>Pesachim</i> – we mention the <i>Zevachim,</i> the offerings, first because we eat the festive offering before we eat the <i>Pesach </i>offering. "
