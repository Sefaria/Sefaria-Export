A praise by David! I will exalt You, my God, the King, and bless Your Name forever and ever. Every day I will bless You and extol Your Name forever and ever. Adonoy is great and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. One generation to another will laud Your works and declare Your mighty acts. The splendor of Your glorious majesty, and the words of Your wonders I will speak. Of Your awesome might, they will speak and Your greatness I will recount. They will make mention of Your bountifulness, and joyfully exult in Your righteousness. Adonoy is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in kindliness. Adonoy is good to all, His mercy encompasses all His works. All Your works will thank You, Adonoy, and Your pious ones will bless You. Of the honor of Your kingship they will speak, and Your might they will declare. To reveal to men His mighty acts, and the glorious splendor of His kingship. Your kingship is the kingship for all times, and Your dominion is in every generation. Adonoy supports all the fallen, and straightens all the bent. The eyes of all look expectantly to You, and You give them their food at its proper time. You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living being. Adonoy is just in all His ways and benevolent in all His deeds. Adonoy is near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon Him in truth. The will of those who fear Him He fulfills; He hears their cry and delivers them. Adonoy watches over all those who love Him, and will destroy all the wicked. Praise of Adonoy my mouth will declare, and all flesh will bless His holy Name forever and ever. And we will bless God from now on forever. Praise God.",

Not with virtue nor with good deeds do we come before You, but like the poor and needy we knock at Your door. At Your door, do we knock, Merciful and Gracious One.

Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy.

Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.",

Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name.

Enter His gates with thanksgiving, His courtyards with praise, give thanks to Him, bless His Name. As for us, through Your abundant kindness we will enter Your House; we will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary in awe of You. Behold, bless Adonoy— all [you] servants of Adonoy, who stand in the House of Adonoy in the night. Lift your hands to the Sanctuary and bless Adonoy. Let us come to His Dwelling Places, let us prostrate ourselves at His footstool. Exalt Adonoy, our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool, Holy is He! Exalt Adonoy, our God and prostrate yourselves at His holy mountain, for Adonoy our God is holy. Prostrate yourselves before Adonoy in the splendor of holiness, tremble before Him all [peoples of] the earth. We will prostrate ourselves toward Your Holy Sanctuary, and give thanks to Your Name for Your kindness and for Your truth; for You have magnified Your word far beyond Your Name. Adonoy, God of Hosts, who is like You, a mighty God; and Your faithfulness is round about You. For who in the skies can be compared to Adonoy, who can be likened to Adonoy among the sons of the mighty? For You are great and do wondrous things; You alone are God. For great beyond the heavens is Your kindness, and until the skies is Your truth. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled, and His greatness is unfathomable. For great is Adonoy and most highly extolled, and awesome is He above all gods. For a great Almighty is Adonoy and a great King over all gods. For who is so mighty in heaven or on earth that can duplicate Your works and Your power. Who would not fear You, King of nations? For to You it is fitting; for among all the wise ones of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. There is none like You, Adonoy great are You, and great is Your Name in might. Yours is an arm with might strong is Your hand, exalted is Your right hand. Yours is the day, also Yours is the night, You established [the] luminary and [the] sun. For in His hands are the depths of the earth, and the heights of the mountains are His. Who can recount the mighty deeds of Adonoy, or cause to be heard all His praise? Yours Adonoy is the greatness, the might, the glory, the victory and the beauty, for all that is in heaven and on earth [is Yours]; Yours Adonoy, is the kingdom, and You are uplifted over all rulers. Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God. The Almighty is revered in the great council of the holy ones and is awe inspiring over all that are about Him. And the heavens will praise Your wonders, Adonoy, and Your faithfulness [will be praised] in the assembly of holy ones. Come let us sing to Adonoy, let us sound the shofar to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us greet His Presence with thanksgiving, with hymns let us raise our voices unto Him. Righteousness and justice are the foundations of Your throne, kindness and truth precede Your Presence. For together let us take sweet counsel; into the House of God let us walk with the throngs. For the sea is His, and He made it; and the dry land, His hands formed. For in His hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all human flesh. The soul is Yours, and the body is Your doing, have pity on Your work. The soul is Yours, and the body is Yours, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. We have come [relying] on Your Name, Adonoy! Act [on our behalf] for the sake of Your Name. For the sake of the glory of Your Name, for gracious and merciful Almighty is Your Name, For the sake of Your Name, Adonoy, pardon our iniquity, for it is great.",

Yours are the heavens, also Yours is the earth, the inhabited world and its fullness; You have founded them. You set all the borders of the earth, summer and winter, You formed them. You crushed the heads of Leviathan, You gave him as food to the people of legions. You split open the fountain and brook, You dried up mighty rivers. You crumbled the sea with Your strength; You shattered the heads of sea monsters upon the waters. You rule over the majesty of the sea; when it raises its waves, You still them. Great is Adonoy and highly extolled in the city of our God, the mountain of His Sanctuary. Adonoy of Hosts, God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim You alone are God.
