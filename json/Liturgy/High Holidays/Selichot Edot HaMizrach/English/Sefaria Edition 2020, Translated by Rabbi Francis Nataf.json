        "I have arisen during the watch hour, to request [forgiveness] for my wrongdoings. My soul is blackened because of my great straying. Have mercy on Your congregation, on the sheep You shepherd. Happy are those who dwell in Your house; they forever praise You. Selah.",
        "Happy are those who dwell in Your house; they forever praise You. Selah. A song of praise of David. I will extol You, my God and King, and bless Your name forever and ever. Every day will I bless You and praise Your name forever and ever. Great is the Lord and much acclaimed; His greatness cannot be fathomed. One generation shall laud Your works to another and declare Your mighty acts. The glorious majesty of Your splendor and Your wondrous acts will I recite. Men shall talk of the might of Your awesome deeds, and I will recount Your greatness. They shall celebrate Your abundant goodness, and sing joyously of Your beneficence. The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in kindness. The Lord is good to all, and His mercy is upon all His works. All Your works shall praise You, Lord, and Your faithful ones shall bless You. They shall talk of the majesty of Your kingship, and speak of Your might, to make His mighty acts known among men and the majestic glory of His kingship. Your Kingship is an eternal kingship; Your dominion is for all generations. The Lord supports all who stumble, and makes all who are bent stand straight. The eyes of all look to You expectantly, and You give them their food when it is due. You give it openhandedly, feeding every creature to its heart’s content. The Lord is beneficent in all His ways and faithful in all His works. The Lord is near to all who call Him, to all who call Him with sincerity. He fulfills the wishes of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and delivers them. ",
        "(And the prayer leader says half-Kaddish:) Exalted and sanctified be His great name (Amen) in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His kingdom, bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Messiah, (Amen) in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future — and say Amen. (Amen) May His great name be blessed forever and for all eternity; blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the name of the Holy One, blessed be He; (Amen) above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world — and say Amen. (Amen)",
        "O man, why are you sleeping? Arise, call out with supplications! Pour out speech, seek forgiveness from the Master of masters. Run and be purified, and do not delay before the days pass on. And quickly run for help before the One who dwells in the [heavenly] abodes. And from rebellion and also evil, escape and fear disasters./ Please answer those who know Your name, the faithful Israel. To You Lord is charity, and to us is shamefacedness./ Stand like a man and be strong to confess sins. The Lord God seek with a serious head, to atone for rebellious sins. For never are unrevealed things hidden from Him. And every statement that is said is read in front of Him./ The merciful One, will have mercy like a father upon his children.",
        "To you, Lord, is justice and to us is shamefacedness. How (lit., what) shall we complain and what shall we say? How can we speak and how can we justify ourselves? We will examine our ways and contemplate, and return to You. For Your right hand is extended, to accept the ones returning to You. They are returning to You with all their hearts; accept, in Your mercy, their beseeching. For Your great mercy we have come before You; like weak and impoverished people we have knocked on Your doors. On Your doors we have knocked, merciful and gracious One, do not let us return empty-handed from before You. From You, our King, do not send us back empty-handed; for You hear prayers. The One who hears prayers, to You all flesh shall come. The spirits shall come before You, and all of the souls. The soul and the body are Yours, spare Your work. The soul and the body are Yours, the Rock that none are like You, spare Your work. The soul and the body are Yours, do it for the sake of Your name. We have pleaded for Your name, do it for the sake of Your name. For the sake of Your name, for Your name is Gracious and Merciful King. Your name will be pronounced about us, Lord our God. Your name will be pronounced among us; do not put us aside, Lord our God. Our God, we are embarrassed of our actions and we are ashamed of our wrongdoings. We do not have a mouth to answer back, nor the temerity to lift up our head. For our backsliding has become great, we have sinned before You. We have sinned with our fathers, we have become criminals and wicked. What shall we say before You, the One who sits above; what will we say before the One who dwells up above? Do You not know what is hidden and revealed? You know the mysteries of the world, and what is hidden by every living being. You search the innermost parts of the abdomen; You see the kidneys and the heart. There is nothing that is lost before You, there is nothing that is concealed before Your eyes. If our sins have testified against us, Lord, do it for the sake of Your name. If You should hold on to sins, God, who will remain standing? For from You is forgiveness, so that You will be feared. For the source of life is with You, we shall see light by Your light. For it is not because of our righteousness that we cast our supplications before You, but it is rather from Your great mercy.",
        "(Some add this on the Ten Days of Repentance:) For Your sake, my God – Desire the people that awake early, for You to beseech Your face during the morning stand. Lord, listen and act, do not delay.",
        "For Your sake, my God – Raise up from the depths of the sea, those sated with hemlock and wormwood in the house of their wanderings and captivity; see their strain and their affliction and do not turn to their rebellion; bend the ear to their call in the morning prayers. Lord, listen and act, do not delay.",
        "For Your sake, my God – And perform a goodly sign and grace sad souls, thirsting for waters of salvation; gather dispersed ones, strewn around all the corners, whose skin, from many troubles, is very black. Lord, listen and act, do not delay.",
        "For Your sake, my God – Show Your mercy, and from the abode of Your name, listen to the voice of Your people who endure Your anger, Your fury and Your rage; from enduring Your punishments, their strength is very faint. Lord, listen and act, do not delay.",
        "For Your sake, my God – Have mercy on Your indigent ones and gladden them from their grief; guide them in Your counsel; and please spare and have mercy upon them from their coming from the belly and bursting out from the womb. Lord, listen and act, do not delay.",
        "Lord, hear; Lord, forgive; Lord, listen and act, do not delay. For Your sake, my God; for Your name is called upon Your city and upon Your people. Bring us back to You and we shall return; renew our days as of old.",
        "The tribe of Judah is in dire straits and in pain, does the lion [not] roar in the forest? They hope for Your salvation, the fathers and the children, poor and destitute. Stand in the breach, so that we not become a mockery; why, Lord, do You stand afar? Your doves have reached the gates of death; appear, the One who sits upon the cherubs. Bring us help from distress; is the hand of the Lord too short? Renew our days in the old exile; awake, why do You sleep? Remember Your children in a land not theirs, so that a stranger not approach them. The hidden end, reveal to the lonely one; Zion shall rejoice, the daughters of Judah shall be gladdened. Let their prayers rise to the high heavens, to the King that sits on His throne of mercy. ",
        "God King, who sits on the throne of mercy, governs with kindness forgives the iniquities of His people. He removes them one by one (Rosh Hashanah 17a:13), increasing forgiveness to sinners, and pardon to transgressors. Acting charitably with all who are of flesh and spirit; not according to their wickedness does He repay them. God, You instructed us to recite the thirteen [divine] attributes; remember unto us this day the covenant of the thirteen [attributes], as You made them known to the humble one of old (Moses): As it is written in Your Torah, “And the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and He proclaimed the Name of the Lord.” And there it is stated,",

        "The faithful men are gone; we would come with the strength of their deeds. They were the strong ones who could stand in the breach; they would push off the decrees. They would be a wall for us; and a shelter at a time of rage. They assuaged the anger with their whispers; they stopped the fury with their entreaties. Before they called You, You answered them; they knew to supplicate and to appease. Like a father did You have mercy for their sake. You did not turn back their faces empty-handed. From our many iniquities, we have lost them. They have been taken from us for our sins. They have moved on to their resting places. They have left us sighing. Those that built fences have been taken; those who turn away the fury were cut off. There are none to stand in the breach. Those fitting to appease You have been taken away. We have wandered to the four corners [of the earth], we have not found a cure. We have returned to you shamefacedly to seek You, God, at the time of our prayers for forgiveness. ",

And since I have sinned upon the positive commandments and the negative commandments, who shall allow that I shall speak every night; in my bed, I shall melt my cot with my tears. Maybe He shall hear the sound of my cries, the Awesome Doer of deeds; I have yelled out today at night. I will call out during the day and raise my voice about my rebellion and transgression; and I will not be silent at night. I mention a few of my sins before the One who knows futures; tonight I arise to confess. And I confess my rebellious and wanton acts about myself; this night is for the Lord.",

We have extorted; we have coveted; we have desecrated Shabbats and Your holy festivals. We have joined with falsehood and deceit. We have given harmful advice without limit. We have deceived; we have become angry. We have mocked. We have rebelled; we have been insubordinate towards Your words; we have rebelled against the Kingdom of heaven; we have rebelled against the kingdom of the House of David; we have rejected the Temple – and we are requesting the three of them. We have provoked; we have committed adultery; we have vowed but not paid. We have strayed; we have been rebellious and disobedient. We have been iniquitous; we have transgressed positive commandments and negative commandments; we have transgressed against [laws, the punishments for which are] excision and the death penalties of the court; we have transgressed [not to] desecrate [God’s] name. We have sinned rebelliously; we have made the holy covenant defective. We have caused grief; we have pained father and mother. We have been stiff-necked; we have damaged the channels of bounty. We have been evil; we have been bad to the Heavens and to the creatures. We have destroyed; we have lied; we have destroyed seed for naught and created a destructive force to destroy – my heart, my heart, for their corpses; my innards, my innards for those they killed! Woe to the evildoer, for the recompenses of his hands will be done to him. We have committed abominations; we have gone astray; we have led others astray.

        "We have been guiltier than any people. We have become more ashamed than any nation. Our joy has been exiled from us. Our heart is despondent from our sins. Our desire is smashed and our glory is broken – the sanctuary of our Temple is destroyed from our iniquities. Our tower has become a desolation; the beauty of our land is for strangers; our strength for foreigners. In front of our eyes, they stole our labor; it is pulled away and plucked from us. They placed their yoke upon us; we bore [it] upon our shoulder. Slaves controlled us; there is no redemption from their hand. Many troubles have surrounded us. We called to You, Lord our God, [but] You distanced Yourself from us because of our iniquities.

(Amen) May you be answered and accepted from the Heavens. May your yelling out be received. May your prayers be willingly heard and may He answer your beseeching. And may the verse be fulfilled with you, in which it is written (Deuteronomy 1:11), \"May the Lord, the God of your fathers, increase your numbers a thousandfold and bless you as He promised you\" (and on the Ten Days  of Repentance: and God write you in the book of goodly life). And so may it be His will — and say Amen. (Amen) May there be acceptance of the prayers and supplications of the entire House of Israel before their Father in heaven. And say, Amen. (Amen) May there be abundant peace from heaven and life, satiation, salvation, consolation, refuge, healing, redemption, forgiveness, atonement, largeness and deliverance for us and for all of His people, Israel — and say Amen. (Amen) He who makes peace in His high heavens, may He, in His mercy, make peace for us and for all Israel, and say, Amen. (Amen)",
        "A song of ascents. Out of the depths I call You, Lord. Lord, listen to my cry; let Your ears be attentive to my plea for mercy. If You keep account of sins, Lord; Lord, who will survive? Yours is the power to forgive so that You may be held in awe. I look to the Lord; I look to Him; I await His word. I am more eager for the Lord than watchmen for the morning, watchmen for the morning. Israel, wait for the Lord; for with the Lord is steadfast love and great power to redeem. ",
        "(And mourners say the mourner's Kaddish:) Exalted and sanctified be His great name (Amen) in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His kingdom, bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Messiah, (Amen) in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future — and say Amen.
