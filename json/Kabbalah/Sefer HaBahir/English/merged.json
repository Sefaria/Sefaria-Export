The king said: Since I have flowing water, I will plant a garden, and I will delight in it, I and all the world.",

It should be, ‘a praise.” Rather regarding anyone who frees his heart from matters of the world and looks at the Act of the Chariot (<i>Maaseh Merkavah</i>), it is received before the Holy One, blessed be He, as if prays the whole day; as it is stated, “A prayer.” What is “<i>Shigionot</i>?” It is as it is written (Proverbs 5:19), “in her love shall you always be infatuated (<i>tishgeh</i>.” But [towards] what is it? The Act of the Chariot, as it is written (Habakkuk 3:2), “O Lord, I have learned of Your renown; I am awed.”",
