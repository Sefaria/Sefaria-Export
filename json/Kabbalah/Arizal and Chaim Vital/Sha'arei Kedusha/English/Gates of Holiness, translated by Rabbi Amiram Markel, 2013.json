            "I have seen those who seek to ascend, but they are few. They long to climb up, but the ladder is hidden from their view. They contemplate the books of the ancients, seeking to discover the paths of life; the way upon which to tread and the deeds that will uplift their soul to its supernal root, so that they may adhere to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה, who is Eternal Perfection, blessed is He; similar to the prophets who spent all their days adhering to their Maker. Through that adhesion the Holy Spirit rested upon them and showed them the path where light dwells, enlightening their eyes in the secrets of Torah, as King David, peace be upon him, said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 119</i> “Unveil my eyes, that I may behold wonders from Your Torah.” The Holy Spirit guided them on a straight path to the “Inhabited City” that is prepared for those who ascend. After the prophets came the ancient <i>Chassidim</i>. These were hermits who sought to follow in the footsteps of the prophets and emulate them. Living in caverns and deserts, they secluded themselves from society. Some remained secluded in their homes but behaved like those in the deserts. Day and night they never ceased praising their Creator through studying His Torah and singing the Psalms of King David, peace be upon him, which gladden the heart. This they did constantly, until their mind adhered to the supernal lights with powerful and mighty yearning. This was their practice all their days, until they rose to the level of receiving the Holy Spirit, prophesying unceasingly. However, since each one acted alone and the character of one person is dissimilar to that of another, the means and methods of how these holy men served <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, blessed is He, were lost to us, so that we cannot emulate their ways.",
            "Because of this, the hearts and knowledge of the following generations dwindled and people who attained the Holy Spirit vanished. These holy men went to their resting places, leaving us groaning from thirst and hunger. Finally, hopelessness of ever exploring this wondrous wisdom sprouted in the hearts of men. Only two or three grains may be found in a stalk of wheat; one in a city or two in a clan, who seek water, but there is none, for all vision has been sealed. This is because the methods of how to approach and come close to the inner holiness were never written in a book.",
            "Later, there arose men who sought to attain spiritual levels by invoking the angels, through the power of invoking their holy names. However, they hoped for light and beheld darkness; for the angels they conjured were of a very low order, who were appointed to affect matters of this lowly world. This being so, they are composed of both good and evil and themselves perceive neither Truth nor the supernal lights. Therefore, they revealed matters that were mixed with good and evil, truth and error and vain things; matters, such as mystical cures, alchemy (the art of transforming silver into gold and copper or tin into silver), amulets, oaths and incantations. Furthermore, these people fell to imbibing wine and strong drink. If only they would have been as devoted to studying Torah and doing mitzvot! They would have learned from the example of the four great sages of Israel who entered Paradise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word paradise is a corruption of the Hebrew word Pardes.</i> Not one of them left unscathed, except for the saintly Rabbi Akiva, and even in his case, the attendant angels attempted to eject him. Had not <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה helped him, he would not have entered in peace and left in peace. If even the greatest sages of Israel were thus endangered, how much more so, we, who cannot begin to compare to them?",
            "Truth be told, these holy sages aspired to attain very great levels, bordering on prophecy. Therefore, they were placed in harm’s way. However, in regard to us, would that we should merit even a tiny glimmer of the Holy spirit, such as the revelation of Eliyahu the Prophet, which many have merited to attain, as well known; or such as the revelation of the souls of the righteous <i>Tzaddikim</i>, as mentioned often in <i>Sefer HaTikkunim</i>-The book of Rectifications.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The subject of the revelation of the souls of the righteous <i>Tzaddikim</i> is discussed at further length in Kuntres HaShitatchut of Rabbi DovBer of Lubavitch, translated into English under the title Visiting the Gravesites of the Righteous.</i> Furthermore, even in our times, I have witnessed holy men who merited attaining all this. Moreover, there is such a level that a person’s own soul, because of its great refinement, is revealed to him and directs him in all matters. All these ways are within reach to those who are worthy of them, even in our times. Still and all, great discernment and much experience are necessary in order that it be established upon truth, for perhaps a different spirit visited him; one that is impure. All this will be explained in Part Three, Gate Eight.",
            "Due to all the above, I feel compelled to free true seekers of their difficulties, by supporting their right hand and instructing them concerning the path they should follow. Therefore, I have decided to compose this book, small in quantity but great in quality; may it enlighten the eyes of the wise. I have called it, “Gates of Holiness.” In it, I will explain hidden matters that have never been openly taught in previous generations. I have received these teachings directly from the mouth of the holy man of God, the messenger of <i>HaShem</i> of <i>Hosts</i> – יהו\"ה צבאות, my master and teacher, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, the holy Ari’zal. Being that these are concealed and hidden matters that have forever been kept secret, I will, therefore, reveal only a hands-breadth while concealing two thousand cubits. Thus, with great difficulty, I will unlock the gates of holiness and push them open just a crack, merely the width of a pin. May it be that those who are worthy, merit entering the inner sanctum. <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה is good and will not deprive goodness from those who walk in purity.",
            "I have divided the book into four parts:",
            "Part One – Regarding saintly and ascetic conduct that leads to the attainment of the Holy Spirit. This part is divided into six gates. Part Two – Words of rebuke, including an explanation of reward and punishment in connection to the positive and negative commandments-<i>mitzvot</i>. This part is divided into eight gates. Part Three – Regarding how to attain the Holy Spirit. This part is divided into eight parts. Part Four – Regarding methods of meditative “unifications” (<i>Yichudim</i>) through which the Holy Spirit may be attained. I have personally tried and tested these and have found them to be effective. However, I will only enumerate their details briefly, by way of signposts that point the way."

                    "Let me instill you with wisdom and enlighten you regarding the great damage that befalls a Jew who transgresses any of the 365 <i>mitzvot</i> that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה forbade us from doing or desists from fulfilling any of the 248 positive <i>mitzvot</i> that He commanded us to do.",
                    "As known, the physical body of man is not his actual identity. It is merely called human flesh, as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 10:11</i> “You clothed me with skin and flesh and covered me with bones and veins.” Furthermore, it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 30:32</i> “It may not be applied to the flesh of man etc.” From this we understand that man is the inner aspect, whereas, the body (the flesh) is similar to a garment. The intellectual soul of man, which is his true identity, is invested in the body as long as he remains in this physical world. However, upon death, he is divested of the garment of the body and instead, becomes clothed in a spiritual, rarified and pure garment. This is as scripture states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zechariah 3:4</i> “Remove the soiled garments from upon him;” and he said to him, “Behold, I have removed your iniquity from upon you and dressed you in a pure garment.” This garment is called, “The Raiment of the Rabbis.”",
                    "Just as the tailor makes a garment according to the form of a person’s body, so <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, blessed is He, made the body, which is the garment for the soul, in the form of the image of the soul. That is, He made 248 organs plus 365 veins and arteries that connect them. The blood and life-force surge from organ to organ by means of these arteries that are similar to pipes. Once the body was formed, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה blew the spirit of life into it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:7</i> This spirit is comprised of 248 spiritual organs and 365 spiritual veins that are invested within the 248 organs and 365 veins of the physical body. With this, the organs of the soul act through the organs of the body, which are their tools, like an axe in the hand of the lumberjack. Proof of this, is the fact that the physical organs only perform their functions so long as the soul resides within them; the eyes see and the ears hear etc. However, upon the departure of the soul, the eyes dim and all sense and feeling vanishes from the 248 organs.",
                    "In like manner, the 365 spiritual veins of the soul are invested within the 365 physical veins and distribute the physical sustenance of the blood to the 248 organs of the body, together with the spiritual sustenance within it, to sustain the 248 organs of the soul. Upon death, when the soul departs, life-force ceases to be drawn to the body. As a result, the physical veins and organs fall apart, decompose and become as if they never were. From this we see that the actual identity of a person is his intellectual soul and that it resides within the body, which acts as its garment while the soul remains in this world.",
                    "Know that when the first man sinned by eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, both his body and soul took on a composition of good and evil. This is the matter of “the contamination of the serpent,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 146a and elsewhere.</i> that was instilled in Eve and Adam. This dross brought about illness, disease and death, both spiritually and physically. This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:17</i> “For on the day that you eat from it, you shall surely die” – meaning the death of the soul, as well as the death of the body.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The literal translation of the verse is, “Die, you shall die,” that is, both physical and spiritual death.</i>",
                    "We will now explain the matter of the good and evil that became mixed in them. (Examine what is written in Part Three, gates two and three, and you will understand what is written in this gate.) Behold, when man sinned with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he caused this admixture to permeate all worlds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sefer HaMashalim of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as The Book of Allegories 1-4, and elsewhere.</i> Due to this, there is nothing that does not include both good and evil in it.",
                    "Therefore, the body of man was formed from the four elements of the physical world<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah, Ch. 4.</i> that have both good and evil included in them. These are fire, air, water and earth.

For the body to be healthy, these humors must be balanced. However, if there is an imbalance, and any one of them overpowers the positive characteristics of the others with its negative characteristics, the result is illness and disease. If it is even more overpowering, death may result.",
                    "As explained, the admixture of good and evil permeated all worlds, even the upper, spiritual worlds. This being the case, the soul of man was also affected, for was it not hewn from the same four spiritual elements from which all the supernal beings were formed? These four elements are the four letters of the name <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a more expansive explanation of the Name HaShem-יהו\"ה, and the manner in which all novel creations are brought forth by and dependent upon the Singular Preexistent Intrinsic and Essential Being of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated under the title HaShem is One.</i> blessed is He and blessed is His name. About this it says,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 37:9 </i> “From the four spirits, come O spirit etc.” This “spirit” that comes is the essential soul of man from the side of goodness. However, God made everything with its opposite.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 7:14</i> Just as the upper spiritual worlds are the source of goodness and purity, so He created a source of evil and impurity. This is the <i>Sitra Achera</i> (The Other Side) which is called <i>Adam BliYa’al</i> (The Incorrigible Man).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 6:12 – “אדם בליעל” – The term “<i>BliYa’al</i>-בליעל” divides into the two words “without a yoke-<i>Bli Ol</i>-בלי עול,” meaning, without the yoke of Heaven, and can also be read “without ascent-<i>Bli Ya’al</i>-בלי יעל,” meaning, the animalistic inclination in man, that descends downward, as stated (Eccl. 3:21), “Who realizes that the spirit of man is the one that ascends on high while the spirit of the beast is the one that descends below down into the earth.”</i> It is made up of four sources of destruction<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnah Bava Kama 1:1 – “The four Fathers of Damages” (אבות נזיקין). </i> and four indicators of plague,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishna Nega’im 1:1 – “The indicators of plague (מראות נגעים), are two, which in fact are four.”</i> which are its four bad elements. From there, an evil soul, which is called, “The Evil Inclination” (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>), is drawn to man. If this soul overpowers the good soul, destruction, plagues and spiritual illnesses befall it. Moreover, if it is too overpowering, it can even cause spiritual death, God forbid.",
                    "Now, the pure soul, which is compared to the fruit, consists of 613 organs and veins and resides within the 613 organs and veins of the impure soul, which is compared to the shell (<i>Kelipah</i>) covering over the fruit. In turn, they both reside within the 613 organs and veins of the body. Thus, the organs of the pure soul reside within the organs of the impure soul and the organs of the impure soul reside within the organs of the body. In order to exist, each of these two souls needs spiritual sustenance. However, the spiritual sustenance of the holy soul is drawn to it through the fulfillment of <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו\"ה Torah, which consists of 613 <i>mitzvot</i>, corresponding to the 613 organs of the soul. Thus, the Torah is called “bread (<i>Lechem</i>-לחם),”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The term “bread-<i>Lechem</i>-לחם-78” has a numerical value of “He was, and He is, and He will be-<i>Hayah v’Hoveh v’Yihiyeh</i>-היה והוה ויהיה-78,” and is a reference to the inner sustenance of the eternal Truth of the Torah of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. This is called “The Inner Bread” (<i>Lechem HaPanim</i>-לחם הפנים) which is a constant in the Holy Temple, as it states (Exodus 25:30), “And you shall set showbread (<i>Lechem HaPanim</i>-לח״ם הפנים) upon the table, before Me, always (<i>Tamid</i>-תמיד).” (See Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 4, section entitled “The First Vowel <i>Cholem</i>-חל״ם.”)</i> as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 9:5</i> “Come, partake of My bread.” Each of the 248 organs receives sustenance from a specific <i>mitzvah</i> that relates to that organ. However, if a Jew lacks the fulfillment of any <i>mitzvah</i>, the organ specific to that <i>mitzvah</i> will lack the sustenance drawn to it from the four letters of the Name <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה. This is indicated by the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nehemiah 9:6</i> “You (<i>HaShem</i>) give life to all.” All the <i>mitzvot</i> depend on these four letters, as our sages of blessed memory said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar I 24a; Zohar III 110b, 222b; 273b, and elsewhere</i> “The letters <i>Yod</i> (י) <i>Hey</i> (ה) coupled with the word, ‘My name’ (שמי) of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 3:15</i> ‘This is My name and this is My memorial (זה שמי וזה זכרי) have the numerical value of 365. The letters <i>Vav</i> (ו) <i>Hey</i> (ה) coupled with the word, ‘My memorial’ (זכרי) of the same verse, have the numerical value of 248.’”",
                    "Likewise, as mentioned above, the roots of the four elements of the holy soul are drawn from these four letters. Therefore, if a person totally lacks a specific <i>mitzvah</i>, the corresponding organ of his holy soul starves to death and departs, God forbid. In turn, when this holiness departs from it, the spirit of impurity from the four elements of the impure soul fills the void and becomes vested in it. This is the secret of the Rabbinic dictum,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi to Genesis 25:23; See Talmud Bavli, Pesachim 42a; Megillah 6a; Zohar II 236a, 238b.</i> “Tyre did not become a great metropolis until Jerusalem was destroyed.” Thus, the organ now receives its sustenance from the “impure bread” that was exiled from there.",
                    "This is the meaning of the statement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Berachot 18b; Zohar III 123a</i> “The wicked are considered to be dead during their lifetime.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Similarly, it states (Proverbs 12:9), “Better is the lowly one who is His servant, than a pompous one who lacks bread (<i>Lechem</i>-לחם),” referring the the aforementioned spiritual sustenance. (See Tzava’at HaRivash (HaRav Yisroel Ba’al Shem Tov) translated as The Way of The Baal Shem Tov, Section 114.)</i> This is because the holy soul from the Living God has withdrawn from them. Rather, death, which is called, “The ultimate source of impurities,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi to Numbers 19:22 and elsewhere. (אבי אבות הטומאה)</i> rests upon them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, their life is not a life.</i> Conversely, regarding a Jew who desists from transgressing the 365 negative <i>mitzvot</i>, the sages stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Kiddushin 39a</i> “A person who desists from transgressing a negative <i>mitzvah</i> is rewarded as if he performed a positive <i>mitzvah</i>.” In other words, by not transgressing, he empowers the spiritual sustenance that is drawn through the positive <i>mitzvot</i>, as mentioned above, to flow through the “pipes,” which are the 365 veins of the soul, thus enlivening its 248 organs. However, if he transgresses any of them, the pipe specific to that transgression becomes blocked due to the contamination of the sustenance from the <i>Kelipah</i>, which adheres to the walls of the pipe. When the pipe withers, the organ that receives from it withers with it. This is so, even if the life-force is not totally withdrawn from it, similar to one who lacks a positive <i>mitzvah</i>. Nonetheless, it becomes blemished.",
                    "This being the case, every Jew should make every effort to fulfill as many of the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> that he can. Furthermore, when he fulfills a positive <i>mitzvah</i>, he should have in mind to rid the specific organ of his soul which correlates to that <i>mitzvah</i>, of the dross of that <i>Kelipah</i>. Once the dross has been removed, the holy organ of the <i>mitzvah</i> may rest upon him. This is the secret of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel 32:27</i> “Their sins were upon their bones,” because when the one rises, the other falls. Likewise, when an opportunity to transgress comes about, he should restrain himself from doing it and have in mind that by doing so, the dross in the specific vein of his soul which correlates to that transgression withdraws. With this, the blockage will be removed and the spiritual influence which is drawn by way of that spiritual pipe will be able to flow through. In this way, his soul becomes a seat and a vehicle for <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו\"ה holiness, blessed is He.

Therefore, the good and bad character traits depend on this soul. They constitute a seat, foundation and root for the upper, intellectual soul, upon which the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> of the Torah depend, as mentioned above in gate one. Because of this, the character traits are not included as part and parcel of the 613 <i>mitzvot</i>. Nonetheless, they are essential prerequisites to their fulfillment or negation, for the simple reason that the intellectual soul is powerless to fulfill the <i>mitzvot</i> with the 613 organs of the body, except through the agency of the elemental soul which is connected to the body. This is the secret meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 17:14</i> “For the soul of every flesh; its blood is its life.” This being the case, bad character traits are actually much worse than the transgressions themselves.",
                    "We may now understand why our sages, of blessed memory, said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar I 27b; Zohar II 182b; Zohar III 179b, 234b; Tikkunim 89b; Zohar Chadash Noach; Mishneh Torah, Hilchot De’ot 2:3</i> “When a person loses his temper, it is as if he is actually worshipping idolatry” – which is a negation of all 613 <i>mitzvot</i> of the Torah!

Contemplate this greatly and consider that since the character traits are root-causes and fundamental characteristics imbedded in the natural soul, they are not counted amongst the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> that depend on the intellectual soul. We therefore find that greater caution must be taken to safeguard oneself from bad character traits, than even from fulfilling the positive <i>mitzvot</i> or desisting from committing the negative <i>mitzvot</i>.

Its four elements are also comprised of both good and evil which affect its health through good character traits, or its illness, through bad character traits that are drawn from its four evil, impure <i>Kelipot</i> (Husks). When a Jew rids himself of these bad character traits, then, in their stead, the four letters of <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו\"ה Name become invested in the natural soul and become a life-giving light for it.

It includes anger, because, when his will is not done, an arrogant person becomes angered. If he would always be humble and recognize his own limitations and shortcomings, he would not lose his temper. From this we see that arrogance and anger are one and the same quality. This character trait has three offshoots;<br>1) Being short-tempered. If not for haughtiness, a person would never be short-tempered, similar to what we explained about anger.<br>2) Seeking to dominate others and be honored by them. This is because he believes he is their superior.<br>3) Hatred toward anyone who actually is his superior. This too is an offshoot of arrogance.",
                    "<b>B) The Element of Wind (Air)</b> This element is the source of the kind of speech that is called, “Idle Chatter.” That is, talking about frivolous matters that have no bearing on anything, neither spiritually nor physically. This character trait has four offshoots;\n<br>1) Speaking words of flattery.\n<br>2) Speaking falsehoods.\n<br>3) Speaking badly (the evil tongue) of others.\n<br>4) Speaking words of boasting and self-aggrandizement to others.",
                    "<b>C) The Element of Water</b> This element is the source of lust and the desire for pleasure. This is because water causes all manner of pleasurable things to grow. This character trait has two offshoots;\n<br>1) Envy. This leads to stealing another’s property or seducing his wife or the theft of anything that someone else possesses that he wants to delight in.\n<br>2) Jealousy. If his friend is wealthy or the like, which he wishes he could be; he will harbor jealousy toward him.",
                    "<b>D) The Element of Earth</b> This element is the source of depression in all its details. It has one offshoot;\n<br>1) Slothfulness. This causes him to be lazy in studying Torah or fulfilling the <i>mitzvot</i>, either because he is depressed by the difficulty of acquiring the vanities of this world or because of troubles that befall him. Such a person will never be happy with his lot, in any matter. Moreover, no matter how wealthy he becomes, it will never satisfy him.",
                    "From the above, we find that there are four sources of all the bad character traits. These are arrogance (including anger, which adheres to it), idle chatter, lust for pleasure, and depression. Their sources are the four <i>Kelipot</i> of the <i>Yetzer</i> <i>HaRa</i> (The Evil Inclination) in the elemental soul. The opposites of these are four good character traits whose sources are the four good elements of the elemental soul. These are:<br>1) Humility. This is a total sense of unimportance. Such a person distances himself from any kind of anger, because anger is a result of haughtiness.\n<br>2) Silence. Except when he is occupied in the study of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> or in the physical needs of the body or for the needs of others, he acts as if mute, as one who cannot open his mouth.\n<br>3) He despises all physical pleasure or unnecessary excesses.\n<br>4) He is always happy with his lot. This is because he realizes that it all is from <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה above, and everything that <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה brings about is for the good.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 60b; Midrash Bereishit Rabba 51:3, and elsewhere; Also see Tzava’at HaRivash translated as The Way of The Baal Shem Tov, Section 2.</i> This attitude also results in alacrity with perfect joy in serving his Creator, as scripture states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 119:162</i> “I rejoice in Your words as one who has discovered vast treasure.” Similarly, our sages stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah Avot 1:15</i> “Make Torah study your permanent priority and your occupation a temporary one.”",

                    "If a Jew wishes to purify and sanctify himself and truly accept the yoke of the Heavenly kingdom upon himself, let him prepare himself with all his might to perform all 613 <i>mitzvot</i> with alacrity. Through their fulfillment the 613 organs and veins of his soul will become perfected, as mentioned above. This is because if he lacks even one of the 248 positive <i>mitzvot</i>, he still lacks an organ of his soul. About such a person scripture states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 1:15</i> “A lacking which is incalculable,” which is worse than the matter of, “Anyone who has a blemish may not approach.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is because, as explained above, a blemish in a <i>mitzvah</i> is not the complete absence of the <i>mitzvah</i>. Therefore, one who lacks a positive <i>mitzvah</i> altogether, is worse off than one who performs it, but in a blemished and imperfect manner. Nonetheless, though his positive <i>mitzvot</i> are blemished, and since he does not transgress the negative <i>mitzvot</i>, he does not fall into the category of an actual “<i>Baal Moom</i>,” that is, a truly blemished person.   </i>\n<br>However, a Jew who fulfills the positive <i>mitzvot</i>, but has transgressed even one of the 365 negative <i>mitzvot</i>, is within the category of an actual “<i>Baal Moom</i>” – a blemished person. This is because the pipe (or vein) that draws sustenance to the organs has become bent [thereby obstructing the flow]. About such as person the verse states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 1:15</i> “irreparably crooked.” However, the meaning of the verse is that it is only irreparable once the soul has departed from this world, because one cannot perform the <i>mitzvot</i> that he lacks or repent and thereby rectify the transgressions that he committed, except while he still is in this world. This is as scripture states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 9:10</i> “Whatever you can accomplish while you are able, do it, for there is neither deed nor accounting nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave to which you are going.” “Deed” here, refers to performing the positive <i>mitzvot</i>, “Accounting” refers to repenting over the negative ones and “knowledge” refers to the knowledge gained through the study of <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו\"ה Torah. None of these are possible “in the grave to which you are going.”\n<br>From here we see that as long as a Jew has not fulfilled the 613 <i>mitzvot</i>, he is in the category of an “Imperfect <i>Tzaddik</i>.” It is not without warrant, that our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, prayed for permission to enter the land 515 times, corresponding to the numerical value of the word, “and I pleaded for grace-<i>VaEtchanan-</i>ואתחנן-515.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Midrash Dvarim Rabba 11:1</i> He sought to perfect his soul by keeping the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> [many of which only apply in the land of Israel].\n<br>If a Jew fulfills all the <i>mitzvot</i>, but has not also fully acquired all the good character traits, in that he must constantly battle and conquer his <i>Yetzer HaRa</i>, such a person is in the category of a “Perfect <i>Tzaddik</i> who conquers his <i>Yetzer</i>.”\n<br>However, once all the good character traits become so totally imbedded in a person that they become his nature, so that he performs the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> with joy that comes from love, without any resistance from the <i>Yetzer HaRa,</i> because his physicality has become totally refined, he is called a “Perfect <i>Chassid</i>.” Similarly, King David said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 109</i> “My heart is empty within me.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This means that he rid himself totally of the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>) by starving it to death. (See Talmud Bavli, Bava Batra 17a; Brachot 61b; Talmud Yerushalmi Brachot 9:5; Sotah 5:5; Orchot Tzaddikim 26:82; Tanya, Ch. 1)</i> Furthermore, he said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 131</i> “<i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, my heart was not proud, nor were my eyes haughty. Neither did I pursue matters that were too great or wondrous for me. Have I not calmed and stilled my soul like an infant nursing from his mother? My soul is like a nursing infant.” This is to say that he appears as if all his good character traits were already naturally embedded in him when he first came out of his mother’s womb. Therefore, because good character traits and the performance of the <i>mitzvot</i> had become so embedded in King David’s nature, he called himself a <i>Chassid</i>, as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 86</i> “Guard my soul, for I am a <i>Chassid</i>.”",
                    "Moreover, our sages, of blessed memory, said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Baba Kama 30</i> “Whosoever desires to become a <i>Chassid</i> should fulfill the words of <i>Pirkei Avot</i> – which speak regarding the acquisition of good character traits. For example, our sages, of blessed memory, said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avot 2:1</i> “Rabbi [Yehudah the Prince] said, “What is the straight path that a person should follow? Everything that is both beautiful to the doer and beautiful to him from others etc.” Akaviah ben Mehalalel said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avot 3:1</i> “Contemplate three matters and you will never come to the possibility of transgressing. Know from whence you came and where you are going and before whom you are destined to give an accounting. From whence did you come? – From a putrid drop. Where are you going? – To a place of dust, maggots and worms. Before whom are you destined to give an accounting? – Before the King, King of kings, The Holy One, blessed is He.” Likewise, Rabbi Levitas of Yavneh said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avot 4:4</i> “Be very, very humble, for the hope of man is maggots.” What Akaviah meant when he said, “and you will never come to the possibility of transgressing” is that you will never be subject to the <i>Yetzer HaRa</i> which causes a person to transgress, because your <i>Yetzer HaRa</i> will cease to be. However, if the <i>Yetzer HaRa</i> still exists and one merely restrains himself by force of willpower, he should have stated, “you will not transgress.”",
                    "Generally, what comes out of this is that a <i>Tzaddik</i> is a person who has a <i>Yetzer HaRa</i> but fulfills the 613 <i>mitzvot</i> by overcoming it. On the other hand, a person who has acquired good character traits completely, as his nature, fulfills the <i>mitzvot</i> because his <i>Yetzer HaRa</i> has been abrogated. Such a person is called a “Perfect <i>Chassid.</i>”",
                    "In addition, there is a level of piety (<i>Chassidut</i>) even higher than this, which is the highest of all levels. Such a person is called “Holy.” This level is mentioned often in <i>Sefer HaTikkunim</i> and in the <i>Zohar</i>, especially in <i>Parashat Kee Teitzei</i> of <i>Ra’aya Mehemna</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar III 281a</i> as follows:",
                    "“It is not without warrant that the Holy One, blessed is He, said, ‘Whosoever occupies himself in the study of Torah, in doing acts of lovingkindness and in praying with the congregation, I regard it as if he redeemed Me and My children from exile amongst the nations of the world.’ Now, how many people occupy themselves in the study of Torah, in doing acts of lovingkindness and in praying with the congregation, but nonetheless, the Holy One, blessed is He, His Indwelling Presence (the <i>Shechinah</i>) and Israel are not redeemed!? However, the meaning here is that a person should be occupied in the study of Torah for the sole purpose of uniting the Indwelling Presence of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה (the <i>Shechinah</i>) to the Holy One, blessed is He. As we have established, “Acts of lovingkindness” here, means that a true <i>Chassid</i> is one who is kind<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, he performs kindness-<i>Chessed</i>-חסד, and is thus called a one who is kind-<i>Chassid</i>-חסיד toward his Master.</i> toward his Master. That is, his intent in doing all the <i>mitzvot</i> is to liberate the Indwelling Presence of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה (the <i>Shechinah</i>) from exile. By doing so, he acts kindly toward the Holy One, blessed is He. By acting kindly toward <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו\"ה Indwelling Presence, he is acting kindly toward <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה Himself, blessed is He. When Israel sinned, the Holy One, blessed is He, wanted to punish them, but their “Mother” – the <i>Shechinah –</i> protected them. Because of this, they descended into evil ways. What did the Holy One, blessed is He, do? He banished the children of the King, along with the Queen [the <i>Shechinah</i>] and He swore that He would not return to His place until the Queen returns to Her place. Thus, whosoever repents with the sole intention of liberating the <i>Shechinah</i> through Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>; such a person acts kindly toward his Master. It is as if he liberates <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה, His <i>Shechinah</i> and His children from exile. Eliyahu and all the heads of the upper academies declared, ‘<i>Raaya Mehemna-</i>Faithful Shepherd [Moshe], you are such a person. You are the son of the King and Queen. Actually, your manner of toil for the Holy One, blessed is He, is even beyond one who acts kindly toward his Master. Rather, you are like a son who invests his whole being and strength into liberating his father and mother; who is willing to give up his very life for their sake. However, a person who is not in the category of being the son of the King, but who, nonetheless, does a kindness to the King and Queen, such a person is considered to be kindly toward his Master.’ <i>Raaya Mehemna-</i>the Faithful Shepherd (Moshe) stood up and bowed before the Holy One, blessed is He. He wept and said, ‘May it be <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו\"ה will to regard me as a son. May it be that He will consider my actions on behalf of the Holy One, blessed is He and His <i>Shechinah</i>, like a son who toils on behalf of his father and mother because he loves them more than his own body, soul [<i>Nefesh</i>], spirit [<i>Ruach</i>] and super-soul [<i>Neshamah</i>], who regards all his possessions as worthless, except for the purpose of serving the will of his Father and Mother and liberating them. Though I realize that [in reality] everything is <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו\"ה possession [and that I have nothing of my own], nonetheless, the Merciful One desires the heart.’”",
                    "Now, the above is as Scripture states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:18</i> “You have disregarded The Rock that bore you.” Moreover, it states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 68:35</i> “Give strength to God.” This is in accordance to the statement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Berachot 17a</i> “Rabbi Yochanan says, ‘Happy is he who toils in Torah and brings satisfaction to the One who formed him.’ – meaning that he does not toil in the study of Torah in order to receive reward at all. Rather, his intent is solely to bring satisfaction to the One who formed him, about Whom it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 63:9</i> “In all their suffering, He suffered.” That is, wherever Israel were exiled, the <i>Shechinah</i> went with them. She is our Mother, about whom it says,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 50:1</i> “Thus says <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה, ‘Where is your Mother’s bill of divorce [as proof] that I have banished her? To which of my creditors did I sell you? Truly, you were sold through your sins and through your transgressions, and she was banished with you.’” [It is, specifically, the <i>Shechinah</i> that] is called “The One Who formed us,” as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:18</i> “You have disregarded The Rock who bore you.” [The word for rock here is <i>Tzoor</i> (צור), which also means the “source of form,” just as a child is formed in its mother’s womb.] This is why Rabbi Yochanan said that such a person brings satisfaction “to The One who formed him,” rather than saying “to The Holy One, blessed is He.”",
                    "From this we see that when a <i>Chassid</i> is occupied in the study of Torah or in performing the <i>mitzvot</i> or in good character traits; if even a hint of motivation to receive a reward is mixed into it, he is a <i>Chassid</i> for himself, as in the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 11:17</i> “A man of kindness (<i>Ish Chessed</i>) brings goodness upon himself.” This is because when he fulfills the <i>mitzvot</i>, he brings goodness upon himself. Therefore, he is called a “Man of <i>Chessed</i>” rather than a “<i>Chassid</i>,” because he does himself the kindness. Only a person whose sole motivation is to do a kindness for his Master can be truly called a “<i>Chassid</i>” and a “Holy Man.” This is because he has become purified from all impurities and has sanctified himself in <i>HaShem’s</i>-יהו\"ה holiness, blessed is He.

                    "When Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah Sotah 9:15 </i> “Caution brings to zeal, zeal brings to cleanliness, cleanliness brings to separateness, separateness brings to purity, purity brings to holiness, holiness brings to fear of sin, fear of sin brings to humility, humility brings to <i>Chassidut</i>, <i>Chassidut</i> brings to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit brings to resurrecting the dead” – he was referring to this. This, specifically, is the perfect <i>Chassidut</i> that follows holiness and leads to the Holy Spirit.

Moreover, the existence of the whole world is worthwhile because of him. He is called friend, beloved, a lover of God, a lover of the creatures, the delight of God and the delight of the creatures. The Torah garbs him in humility and awe. It prepares him to be a <i>Tzaddik</i>, a <i>Chassid</i>, upright and trustworthy. It distances him from sin and brings him close to merit.

                    "Now, it all includes two categories; the Emanator and all the Emanated.

What is important for you to know is that all things below in the worlds, meaning, all that is actualized, formed and created, have a refined and concealed root above in the Essential Self of the Singular Preexistent Intrinsic Being of the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), blessed is He.<br>Now, it is known that the nature of a thing that is hewn from another, is that within itself, it always possesses the power of that which it was hewn from. For example, within the branch of a tree is the power of the root, and necessarily, in the same manner, within the root of the tree is the power of the branch. If this was not the case, it would be impossible for the branch to come from the root. This being so, the ten Sefirot of the world of Emanation-Atzilut [which are the branch] necessarily possess a very hidden and concealed root in the Essential Self of the Singular Preexistent Intrinsic and Essential Being of the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), blessed is He. However, in Him, they actually are not recognizably differentiated, God forbid to think so. In other words, it is impossible for us to differentiate and say that, “this is the crown-Keter” or “this is wisdom-Chochmah” etc., but it rather is like a Heyulie, similar to what we say below, in the world of Action-Asiyah, that the Heyulie is the root of the four elemental foundations.<br>Now, the words of the Ari”zal are well known, namely, that “when it arose in His simple will to create the worlds, the Unlimited One, blessed is He, estimated within Himself, in the aspect and level of His Kingship-Malchut, as in the verse (Psalms 145:13), “Your Kingship (Malchutcha) is the kingship (Malchut) of all the worlds.” (By way of analogy, this is called the aspect of Kingship within Kingship-Malchut sh’bMalchut of the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), even though this is not truly the case. For, in reality, we are incapable, and therefore barred from ascribing any form whatsoever to the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), blessed is He, neither any image nor any Sefirah whatsoever, God forbid to think so. Rather, it only is in order to satisfy the ear that we speak in such terms, as the author writes in Etz Chayim, Drush ABY”A, Ch. 1.) All the lower worlds that are emanated from the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), blessed is He, receive from Him, similar to the fact that biologically, the female receives from the male, so to speak. It is for this reason that the verse, “Your Kingship is the Kingship of all worlds,” begins by specifying, “Your Kingship-Malchutcha-מלכותך,” in the masculine, indicating that relative to the construct of the worlds, He is the giver, and it is only in relation to the other Sefirot that are above her, that she is called by the title kingship-Malchut-מלכות. This then, is the meaning of the continuation of the verse, “is the Kingship-Malchut-מלכות of all the worlds,” meaning that all worlds are emanated into her.<br>Now, it is known that the male is called by the term “He-Hoo-הוא,” and this term “He-Hoo-הוא” includes all ten Sefirot from below to above, as follows: The Hey-ה of the word “He-Hoo-<b>ה</b>וא” hints at the feminine aspect, which is included in the Sefirah of foundation-Yesod, and is the mystery of the corona-Atarah-עטרה. The Vav-ו-6 of the word “He-Hoo-ה<b>ו</b>א” hints at the six directions of the Sefirah of beauty-Tiferet. The Aleph-א of the term “He-Hoo-הו<b>א</b>” hints at the crown-Keter, wisdom-Chochmah, and understanding-Binah. For, as known, the first three Sefirot are considered as one, like the form of the letter Aleph-א. That is, the Yod-י above is wisdom-Chochmah, the Yod-י below is understanding-Binah, and the Vav-ו in between is the mystery of knowledge-Da’at, which mediates between wisdom-Chochmah and understanding-Binah, and as known, knowledge-Da’at is at times entitled the crown-Keter, in that it is the middle line that is called (Ex. 26:28) “The center bar that goes from end to end,” from above to below, as known.<br>We should also point out an additional reason that the Aleph-א hints at the first three Sefirot. Namely, as known, the title of the first three Sefirot is the name Ya”H-י״ה. That is, the thorn of the Yod-י is the crown-Keter, the Yod-י itself is wisdom-Chochmah, and the Hey-ה is understanding-Binah. When the Name Ya”H-י״ה is spelled out according to the name of Ma”H-מ״ה-45 [the Name HaShem-יהו״ה spelled with Aleph’s-א], that is, Yod Hey-יו״ד ה״א, it has the numerical value of כ״ו-26, which is the same numerical value as the Aleph-א, which has a Yod-י-10 above, a Yod-י-10 below, and Vav-ו-6 in between, in a way of complete Oneness-א. Thus, the first three Sefirot are called the Aleph-א of the word “He-Hoo-הו״א.” Also, as known, Malchut, which is the feminine aspect, is called, “His Name-Shem-שם.” This then, is what our sages, of blessed memory, meant when they said, “Before the creation of the world there was He-Hoo-הו״א,” meaning all the aforementioned aspects as they are in the Essential Self of the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), blessed is He, “and His Name-Shmo-שמו,” meaning the aspect of Kingship-Malchut of the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), which includes all the emanated, who are the recipients of the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), blessed is He, and are feminine, in that they are recipients relative to He who is above. All of it is included in the mystery of His Oneness (Echad-אחד), meaning that they are in a state of absolute unity, “like a flame that is bound to the coal.”<br>It may thus also be said that this is the meaning of the verse (Psalms 33:9), “He-Hoo-הוא spoke and it came to be, He-Hoo-הוא commanded and it stood firm.” This is to be understood as mentioned above, that the term “He-Hoo-הוא” refers to the Unlimited One (Ein Sof), blessed is He, according to the order of the levels of the roots in ascending order from below to above. This is likewise the meaning of the verse (Psalms 132:13), “For HaShem-יהו״ה has chosen Zion, Desiring it (Eevah-או״ה) as His habitation.” That is, the letters of the word, “Desiring it-Eevah-או״ה” are the same letters as the levels of the aforementioned roots, but in descending order, from Above to below. That is, the Aleph-א is the crown-Keter, wisdom-Chochmah, and understanding-Binah, the Vav-ו is the six directions of Beauty-Tiferet, and the Hey-ה is kingship-Malchut. The distinction between these two orders, is the distinction between the direct, forward light (Ohr Yashar) and the rebounding, returning light (Ohr Chozer), however, it all is an absolute Unity and Oneness. This should suffice for the understanding.</i>",
                    "Now, it was explained that all the worlds are included in the Name of Being-<i>Shem Havayah</i>-שם הוי״ה, which is divided into four foundations and ten <i>Sefirot</i>. In the same manner, this is likewise the case with each of the worlds, in the same manner, that each of them also divides into particulars. That is, the world of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>, which is the letter <i>Yod</i>-יו״ד (י) and is called wisdom-<i>Chochmah</i>, divides into each of the aforementioned aspects. It too possesses one complete Name of Being-<i>Havayah Achat</i>-הוי״ה אחת that is divided into four foundations and ten complete <i>Sefirot</i>, literally in the same manner that we mentioned in regard to the worlds in general. The same is likewise so of each of the five aforementioned worlds. The same is likewise the case that each further divides into its further particulars to the utmost specificity, until we find that even in this lowly world, even the most minor creation contains the totality of the four letters of Being-<i>Havayah</i>-הוי״ה and all the ten <i>Sefirot</i> within itself<i>.</i> All this is to show that everything is created by the power of the Emanator, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, and aside for Him, nothing exists.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">807</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is explained at length in Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One.</i>",
                    "Another introductory matter that you must know, is that all these aspects and levels, from the exalted level of Primordial Man-<i>Adam Kadmon</i>, until the depths of the abyss of this lowly world, are all one above the other, and one within the other. For, the one that is higher manifests within the one that is below it, like the soul to the body. However, it is not all of the upper aspect that manifests within the lower aspect. Rather, it only is a specific aspect, which is the lowest level of the upper level, that manifests within each lower level, and the same is true in succession, until this lowest of all worlds. That is, such is the case with all the worlds, whether we are discussing the worlds in general, or whether we are discussing each particular aspect of them, including even in this world – in every particular detail in them, it is in this manner. That is, there is one that is higher than another, and one that is inner to the other, to the point that they all are like garments for one another, and ultimately, they all are garments of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, who is the Soul of all souls.",
                    "However, in each of these five worlds, there is a separation in the spreading forth of their lights and the extent of their spreading forth, so that there should be a distinction between them. Similarly, there is another separation in the particulars of the four foundations of each world, as well as in the particulars of the particulars, but this is not the place for the explanation of this matter.",
                    "What we find is that in the manner of the spreading forth of lights and illuminations from Above to below, there is no <i>Sefirah</i> that does not include all ten <i>Sefirot</i> within it, and each particular <i>Sefirah</i> further subdivides into thousands and tens of thousands of <i>Sefirot</i>. The same is likewise so of the spreading forth of the lights from inner to outer. It also is in this manner. For, the innermost of the <i>Sefirot</i> is called the crown-<i>Keter</i>, and the outer <i>Sefirah</i> that is upon it, is wisdom-<i>Chochmah</i>, and the outer <i>Sefirah</i> that is upon it, is understanding-<i>Binah</i>, and the outer <i>Sefirah</i> that is upon it, are the six directions of beauty-<i>Tiferet</i>, and the outermost of them all, is kingship-<i>Malchut</i>. The same is likewise so with each particular aspect, that it divides in this manner into thousands and tens of thousands of particular details.",
                    "However, because we have already provided the complete explanations of this matter,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">808</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the book Etz Chayim</i> as it is in all the worlds – except for the matter of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> – we will therefore only explain this subject in great brevity here, to the extent that it is necessary to understand the desired subject that we seek in this book.",
                    "Now, there are seven firmaments. The uppermost is called <i>Aravot</i>, because it includes the first three <i>Sefirot</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> within it. These are the Sphere of the Intellect (<i>Galgal HaSechel</i>), the Surrounding Sphere (<i>Galgal HaMakif</i>), and the Sphere of the Constellations (<i>Galgal HaMazalot</i>). The five spheres of Saturn (<i>Shabtai</i>), Jupiter (<i>Tzeddek</i>), Mars (<i>Ma’adim</i>), the Sun (<i>Chamah</i>), and Venus (<i>Nogah</i>), are the <i>Sefirot</i> of kindness-<i>Chessed</i>, Judgment-<i>Gevurah</i>, beauty-<i>Tiferet</i>, conquest-<i>Netzach</i> and majesty-<i>Hod</i>. The sixth sphere is foundation-<i>Yesod</i>, and includes both Mercury (<i>Kochav</i>) and the Moon (<i>Levanah</i>). ",
                    "The last firmament, which is called <i>Veelon</i>, has nothing of her own with which to serve,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">809</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 12b; Etz Chayim, Shaar 38, Ch. 3 (See also Ohev Yisroel, Vayechi 4); Also see Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 2, Section entitled, “The seven letters בג״ד כפר״ת correspond to the seven firmaments-Raki’im-רקיעים.”</i> and is the <i>Sefirah</i> of kingship-<i>Malchut</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>. Nevertheless, it too is divided into the ten <i>Sefirot</i> that are within it, which are as follows: The firmament <i>Veelon</i> is the crown-<i>Keter</i> within it. The four elemental foundations of fire (<i>Aish</i>), air (<i>Ru’ach</i>), water (<i>Mayim</i>), and earth (<i>Affar</i>) of this lowly world, are the aspects of wisdom-<i>Chochmah</i>, understanding-<i>Binah</i>, the six-directions of beauty-<i>Tiferet</i>, and kingship-<i>Malchut</i>. We thus find that kingship of kingship – <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> – that is within the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> is the foundational element of earth (<i>Affar</i>), which is the receptacle and substance-matter of this entire world. It is in this foundational element of earth (<i>Affar</i>) that all of its offspring are included, as it includes within it all four fundamental elements that were mentioned, as per the explanation of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">810</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 3:20</i> “All originate from the earth (<i>Affar</i>).”",
                    "We have thus explained the matter from Above to below, as well as from the inner to the outer. For, the elemental foundation of earth (<i>Affar</i>) contains ten <i>Sefirot</i>. Their crown-<i>Keter</i> is the innermost, and is called the aspect of the <i>Yechidah</i> essence of the foundational element of earth (<i>Affar</i>). External to it is wisdom-<i>Chochmah</i>, which is the aspect of the <i>Chayah</i> of the earth (<i>Affar</i>). External to that is the aspect of understanding-<i>Binah</i>, which is the aspect of the <i>Neshamah</i> of the earth (<i>Affar</i>). External to that is the aspect of the six-directions of beauty-<i>Tiferet</i>, which is the <i>Ru’ach</i> of the earth (<i>Affar</i>). External to that is kingship-<i>Malchut</i>, which is the <i>Nefesh</i> of the foundational element of earth (<i>Affar</i>). This external aspect of kingship-<i>Malchut</i> itself divides into ten <i>Sefirot</i> that are within it, and their kingship-<i>Malchut</i> is the foundational element of the gross physical earth (<i>Affar</i>) itself, which contains no spirituality at all, but only gross substance, which is called inanimate (<i>Domem</i>), whereas that which is inner to it, is called the soul-<i>Nefesh</i> of the inanimate (<i>Domem</i>).",
                    "The same applies to the foundational element of water (<i>Mayim</i>). For, the aspect of kingship-<i>Malchut</i> is the most external of its aspects, which is called water that brings forth growth and vegetation, and it thus is called the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>), and all the aspects that are inner to it, are called the soul-<i>Nefesh</i> of the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>). The same is so of the elemental foundations of air (<i>Ru’ach</i>) and fire (<i>Aish</i>), which are the animate (<i>Chay</i>) and speaking beings (<i>Medaber</i>), respectively. Together, the four are as follows: The inanimate (<i>Domem</i>) is the <i>Nefesh</i>; the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>) is the <i>Ru’ach</i>; the animate (<i>Chay</i>) is the <i>Neshamah</i>; the speaking being (<i>Medaber</i>) is the <i>Chayah</i>; and <i>Veelon</i> is the <i>Yechidah</i>. As already explained, each of these aspects includes them all.",
                    "These aspects are referred to by the philosophers as “powers.” For example, they stated that the soul (<i>Nefesh</i>) of the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>) possesses the power to sustain, the power to draw sustenance, the power to absorb and the power to expel. Similarly, they stated about the soul of the animate living being (<i>Chay</i>) that it possesses the power of motion, the power of movement and the sensatory powers, and that it possesses the power of consciousness, the power of imagination and the power of imagery etc. The same principle applies to them all.",
                    "What arises from all this, is that even though kingship-<i>Malchut</i> is the most external of all the levels of whatever aspect it may be, nevertheless, it is the body of that aspect. However, it is not a body of actual coarse and gross physical substance. Rather, that is only the case with the final most external aspect of kingship-<i>Malchut</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>, from above to below and from inner to outer. Only that level, which is the foundational element of completely gross material earth (<i>Affar</i>), is the coarsest and most gross body in all the world."

                    "<b>The Existence of Man</b>",
                    "In this section we shall explain wondrous mysteries, teachings that were never openly revealed by the ancients,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">811</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A play on Deuteronomy 32:17 (see Rashi there)</i> and were they not necessary in order to explain the matter of prophecy, I would never have explained them. I therefore shall write them with the utmost brevity, and may they be as,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">812</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 27:26</i> “lambs (<i>Kvasim</i>-<i><b>כבש</b>ים</i>) for your clothing,” meaning that,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">813</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 13a</i> “Matters that are the secrets of the world (<i>Kivshono shel Olam</i>-<i><b>כבש</b>ונו של עולם</i>) should remain hidden under your clothing.”",
                    "I shall ask several deep questions as follows:",
                    "1. Why was it necessary for man to be created in this world, with a soul and a body?",
                    "2. Why, was man bestowed two additional forms when he was formed, these being the good inclination (<i>Yetzer Tov</i>) and the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer Hara</i>) that are within him?",
                    "3. Since both are equally balanced within him, what is it that gives man the strength to choose and tip the scales to one or the other? Moreover, if he indeed has the ability to tip the scales to one or other, why then were they created altogether?",
                    "4. We must explain the matter of these two inclinations and what they are.",
                    "5. We must know whether the soul of man is greater than the angelic beings or not. If we say that man is greater than the angels, then why did the angels not also descend into this physical world to manifest in a soul and a body? On the other hand, we cannot say that angels are greater than man. For, in all the teachings of our sages, of blessed memory, we find the opposite to be true. For example, along with many other teachings, they stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">814</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Midrash Bereishit Rabba 78:1</i> “Who is greater, the guard or the guarded?” Moreover, even Scripturally, the verses themselves indicate the opposite to be true, as written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">815</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:18</i> “You weakened<i>-תשי</i> the Rock who bore you,” and,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">816</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 68:35</i> “Give strength to God, whose pride is over Israel,” and,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">817</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14:1</i> “You are children to <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i> your God,” and,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">818</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 49:3</i> “You are My servant Israel, in whom I take pride.” Moreover, the angels do not recite “Holy, Holy, Holy,” until the Jewish people below recite it first.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">819</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Chullin 91b; Midrash Shemot Rabba 23:7</i> We find no such things whatsoever stated about the angels.",
                    "6. Even if we submit that man is greater than the angels, it nevertheless remains entirely questionable to call them “His children,” or to say that they weaken (<i>מתישים</i>) or strengthen Him, or that He takes pride in them, for a person could possibly fall into heresy from this.",
                    "7. In regard to the matter of prophecy, how is it applicable that the King, King of kings, the Holy One, blessed is He, would speak to lowly man, even through the agency of an angel, especially since man is manifest in the grossest and coarsest substance in all the worlds?",
                    "Now, in the preceding gate we explained the matter of the existence of the worlds and how they all are One Being-<i>Havayah Achat</i>-<i>הוי״ה אחת</i> that includes them all, and that they are divided into five worlds. We explained that these are called the <i>Yechidah</i>, <i>Chayah</i>, <i>Neshamah</i>, <i>Ru’ach</i>, and <i>Nefesh</i>. We also explained that this physical world is the body and substance to them all. That is, each of the worlds are in the form of man, and each possesses substance and form, and each are divided into five spiritual levels, as explained. You also know that when the Name of <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i> is spelled out with the letter <i>Aleph</i>-<i>א</i> [<i>יו\"ד ה\"א וא\"ו ה\"א</i>] it has the same numerical value as “man-<i>Adam</i>-<i>אדם-</i>45.” The same is likewise so of each particular detail in all their various levels. Each of them is called a particular man (<i>Adam</i>-<i>אדם</i>), which includes One Being-<i>Havayah Achat</i>-<i>הוי\"ה אחת</i> that divides into four foundations and ten <i>Sefirot</i>.",
                    "There is another division that was not explained in the preceding gate, which is that the ten <i>Sefirot</i> also subdivide further into 613 aspects, as will be explained. Nevertheless, it is understood that all the worlds as a whole, as well as each particular world, in and of itself, is created in the form of the lower man. This is the mystery of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">820</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 1:26</i> “Let us make man in Our image, after Our likeness.” Understand this well.",
                    "Now, it has already been explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">821</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Etz Chayim, Shaar 47, Ch. 4</i> that everything from the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i> and down, is called the Tree of Knowledge, in that it includes both good and evil. Additionally, it has been explained that with the successive descent of their levels, there is a diminishment of the good and an increase of the evil, to the point that we find that this lowly world is mostly evil with very little good. It also is explained that “the wicked surrounds the righteous,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">822</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Habakkuk 1:4</i> and therefore the good is called the fruit, whereas the evil is called the peel or shell (<i>Kelipah</i>) that covers over the fruit. Moreover, the same is likewise true that the good lights and illuminations are also in this manner, that is, the more refined and spiritual among them are manifest within the remaining lights and illuminations. The same is true of them all, according to the order of their levels. In the preceding gate it was also explained how the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i>, blessed is He, is the innermost of them all, and that the <i>Sefirot</i> are external to Him, according to the order of their levels, with the crown-<i>Keter</i> being the most inner and kingship-<i>Malchut</i> being the most external.",
                    "We now shall begin explaining what has yet to be explained. Namely, just as this unique light, which is called the world of the Ten <i>Sefirot</i>, is in the image of a single man, so likewise, there is another light of man (<i>Adam</i>-<i>אדם</i>) that is called the source of the souls of all people. It too includes all the particulars that were explained in regard to the man (<i>Adam</i>-<i>אדם</i>) of the Ten <i>Sefirot</i>, literally. That is, the man (<i>Adam</i>-<i>אדם</i>) of the Ten <i>Sefirot</i> is considered to be completely Godly, and it manifests within the light and illumination which is the source of the souls, in all their particular details.",
                    "There is also another light in the form of man (<i>Adam</i>-<i>אדם</i>) which is called the source of the angels. That is, all the angels are hewn from this light, and it too includes all the above-mentioned details. It is the outer garment over the light that is the source of the souls.",
                    "There is yet another lesser light, which is called dark light, that consists entirely of harsh judgments. It is from this light that all the shells of the <i>Kelipot</i> of that particular world emanate from. This light, garbs the light that is the source of the souls, and it too possesses the image of man (<i>Adam</i>-<i>אדם</i>). Outside all these lights that we have mentioned, are the firmaments (<i>Raki’im</i>) themselves, as they are in that particular world. They are called the body (<i>Guf</i>) of that particular world, and within them, the five above-mentioned lights are manifest. That is, the light of the Unlimited One (<i>Ohr Ein Sof</i>), blessed is He, as it manifests according to the capacity of that particular world, is innermost. Upon Him, like a garment, is the light of the source of the souls. Upon it, like a garment, is the light of the source of the angels. Upon it, like a garment, is the light of the source of the shells of <i>Kelipah</i>. Upon it, like a garment, is the world itself, which are the firmaments (<i>Raki’im</i>) that are the body (<i>Guf</i>), together with the above-mentioned inner lights. Subsequently, from this body (<i>Guf</i>), which is called the firmaments (<i>Raki’im</i>), the offspring of that world are created, each of which includes all these aspects. For, each of them has a power drawn to it from the firmament, which is its body. That is, within it are the lights of the judgments, and within it are the lights of the angels, and within it is the light from the source of the souls, and within it are the lights of the Ten <i>Sefirot</i>, that rides upon them and enlivens them all.",
                    "Now, that power that is drawn to it from the light of the source of the souls is called the Upper Flow (<i>Mazal HaElyon</i>) of that soul of lower man. Understand this very well, and also realize that this aspect, as it exists in the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, is called the Flow (<i>Mazal</i>) of the <i>Neshamah</i>, whereas this aspect in the world of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i>, is called the Flow (<i>Mazal</i>) of the <i>Ru’ach</i>, and in the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> it is called the Flow (<i>Mazal</i>) of the <i>Nefesh</i>.",
                    "We shall now explain the matter of man’s existence and will begin by explaining his existence starting from kingship-<i>Malchut</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> and going up in ascending order.",
                    "We already explained each world in general and the offspring of that world and their substance. Now, in the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>, the first and lowest aspect that we shall discuss, is the aspect of the kingship-<i>Malchut</i> within it, which is called the four foundational elements of the lowly world. All of its offspring are constructed of the body (<i>Guf</i>) within these aspects, which is the foundational element of physical earth (<i>Affar</i>). They are divided into four categories, as follows:",
                    "The lowest level is the category of precious stones and metals, which consist only of the foundational element of earth (<i>Affar</i>). These receive from the four elemental foundations (<i>Yesodot</i>) as they are composed in their bodies and intermingled to form that particular metal. However, there is one power within each of them which is the cause of the particular admixture that we mentioned, and is called the soul (<i>Nefesh</i>) of the foundational element of earth (<i>Affar</i>), and it itself is composed of its five powers and levels, as previously mentioned.",
                    "Afterwards, vegetative plants (<i>Tzome’ach</i>) were created, such as trees and grasses. Their bodies also are from the foundational element of earth (<i>Affar</i>), and they too have the soul (<i>Nefesh</i>) of the inanimate (<i>Domem</i>). However, they also have an additional soul, which is the soul (<i>Nefesh</i>) of the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>) and includes its five powers and levels.",
                    "Afterwards, the animate beings (<i>Chay</i>) were created, referring to animals and birds etc. They have the body (<i>Guf</i>) and soul (<i>Nefesh</i>) of the inanimate (<i>Domem</i>), as well as the soul (<i>Nefesh</i>) of the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>), and in addition, they also have the soul (<i>Nefesh</i>) of the animate (<i>Chayah</i>), which is called the animalistic soul (<i>Nefesh HaBehamit</i>) and includes the power of movement and the sensatory powers.",
                    "Afterwards, man the speaker (<i>Medaber</i>) was created. He has all the above-mentioned powers, but in addition, he also has a speaking soul (<i>Nefesh HaMedaberet</i>), which is from the elemental foundation of fire (<i>Aish</i>).",
                    "However, know with certainty that all these aspects of body and soul as they are in man, are much more refined than they are in the animate (<i>Chay</i>) and that the animate (<i>Chay</i>) are more refined than the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>), and that the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>) more refined than the inanimate (<i>Domem</i>). This should be clear based on what has already been explained. For, in each of these aspects, all of the other aspects are included, each one being more inner than the other.",
                    "Afterwards, He created the Jewish man, who is much more refined in all his aspects than all other created beings, both in his body and in the four aspects of his soul, these being the inanimate (<i>Domem</i>), the vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>), the animate (<i>Chay</i>) and the speaking (<i>Medaber</i>). That is, he is of the innermost and most refined aspect of each of the four foundational elements within them, as well as their form (<i>Tzurah</i>), meaning, the soul (<i>Nefesh</i>) that is within them.",
                    "Now, because he is more refined than all other creatures of the earth, he is elevated to a greater extent, since he also includes and is bound to all the worlds in all their particular details, from below to above. That is, initially a soul manifests within him from the firmament of <i>Veelon</i>, and that level of soul and above, until even the highest firmament of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>, is all called the soul-<i>Nefesh</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>. This aspect of the soul is called the holy intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet HaKedoshah</i>) within man. However, this level of soul itself is divided into the five powers of <i>Yechidah</i>, <i>Chayah</i>, <i>Neshamah</i>, <i>Ru’ach</i> and <i>Nefesh</i>.",
                    "It also divides into two categories in a different manner. For, all the aspects that it takes from the four elemental foundations are called the soul of the elements (<i>Nefesh HaYesodot</i>) and are taken from the above-mentioned powers of the inanimate (<i>Domem</i>), vegetative (<i>Tzome’ach</i>), animate (<i>Chay</i>) and speaker (<i>Medaber</i>), and the soul-<i>Nefesh</i> from <i>Veelon</i> is the crown-<i>Keter</i> over them all, and is called the intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet</i>). The aspects that are from the other nine firmaments, are divided into the <i>Ru’ach</i>, <i>Neshamah</i>, <i>Chayah</i> and <i>Yechidah</i> of the <i>Nefesh</i>, and altogether, they are called one soul-<i>Nefesh</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> of the general worlds.",
                    "Afterwards he obtains a <i>Ru’ach</i> from the world of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i>, and it too is divided into a number of levels in the same manner mentioned before. Nevertheless, in relation to the aspect of the general worlds, it is called a <i>Ru’ach</i>. The same is likewise so with the <i>Neshamah</i> from the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, as well as with the <i>Chayah</i> from the world of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>, and with the <i>Yechidah</i> from Primordial Man-<i>Adam Kadmon</i>.",
                    "We thus have clearly explained the nature of the existence of man, and that he includes all the worlds within himself, whether generally or particularly. In contrast, this is not the case with all the other creatures, be they supernal creatures or lower creatures. For, all the offspring of a particular world, only include within themselves that particular world within which they were created.",
                    "Now, everything we have stated to this point explains the matter in a way of ascent from below to above. However, man also includes all the worlds within himself from inner to outer, as follows: In the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>, he has a body of earth (<i>Affar</i>) which is called the lowly world. Within it are the elemental souls from the external husks (<i>Kelipot</i>), and within that are the aspects of the angels of this world, which were created for the purpose of maintaining this world, such as causing the plants to grow etc. Within all of that, he possesses an aspect of a <i>Neshamah</i> level of soul from the souls of man. All these aspects are made to be a chariot (<i>Merkavah</i>) for the light and illumination that is drawn from the lights of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>, which manifest in the four elemental foundations in order to vitalize them, and they are the most inner of them all. The same likewise applies to the aspects within man that stem from the celestial spheres of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>, as well as from the three worlds of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i>, Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, and Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>.",
                    "With the above in mind, we now can explain the answers to all the questions written at the beginning of this gate. For, the light of the source of souls, is more inner and loftier than the light of the source of the angels, and this is why the angels are in the service of the souls. For, it is through the souls that light and vitality is drawn to the angels from the ten <i>Sefirot</i>.",
                    "This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">823</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 33:7 – The “heralds-Erelam-אראלם” referred to in this verse are the Erelim-אראלים angels, which stem from the higher archangel Ariel-אריא״ל. (See Radak to Isaiah 33:7; See Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 2:7)</i> “Behold, the heralding angels cried out from outside.” For, when sustenance is not drawn to the souls that are more inner than them, they too lack sustenance, being that they are external to them. This is why they cried out and mourned during the time of the destruction, since they are external to the souls. Moreover, this explains why the angels did not descend to manifest in a physical body in this world, because they necessarily would be destroyed by the judgements and shells of the <i>Kelipot</i>. This is because even the souls do not have the power to withstand the shells of the <i>Kelipot</i>. How much more is this so in regard to the angels. Proof of this is from the <i>Nefillim</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">824</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 6:4 and Targum Yonatan ben Uziel; Pesikta Rabbati 34:1; Yoma 67b and Rashi there; Zohar I 37a. The word Nefillim means “the fallen ones” and refers to the fallen angels.</i> who requested to descend to this world and were thus destroyed from the world and are wiped out of the coming future. An even greater reason is that because of their lesser state, they would be incapable of drawing influence to all the worlds, but could only do so from their level and out. Moreover, even this itself would not be possible, since they cannot draw sustenance to themselves except through the medium of the souls. Nevertheless, it is indeed true that a soul of the world of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i> is lesser than an angel from the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, and the same applies to all the worlds. However, a soul of the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i> is greater than an angel of the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, and the same applies to each of the worlds themselves.",
                    "Thus, the greatness of the soul has also been explained, since the soul is a light that is born of and drawn from the light of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> themselves, rather than through the medium of an intermediary. This is why the Jewish people are called,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">825</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 14:1</i> “the children to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה our God.” For, they are in the aspect of a child who is entirely one with his father and is drawn forth from Him. About this, our sages, of blessed memory, said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">826</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Midrash Bereishit Rabba 47:6; 69:3, 82:6 and elsewhere.</i> “The forefathers [Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov] are the Supernal Chariot (<i>Merkavah</i>),” meaning that they are the vehicle for the light of the ten <i>Sefirot</i>, that rides directly upon them, rather than through the medium of any lesser light. This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">827</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 49:3</i> “You are My servant Israel, in whom I take pride.” For, a person’s garments are his pride, as written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">828</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 61:10</i> “Like a bridegroom who adorns himself with pride, like a bride who bedecks herself with her jewelry.”",
                    "Now the light of the souls is a garment for the ten <i>Sefirot</i>. This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">829</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song of Songs 6:2</i> “My Beloved has gone down to His garden,” referring to this world. The verse concludes, “To graze His sheep in the gardens, and to pick roses-<i>Lir’ot BaGaneem v’Leelkot Shoshanim</i>-<i><b>ל</b>רעות <b>ב</b>גנים <b>ו</b>ללקוט <b>ש</b>ושנים</i>,” which forms the acrostic (<i>Notarikon</i>) “garment-<i>Levush</i>-<i>לבוש</i>.” For, he picks the souls of the righteous, who are as fragrant as roses because of their good deeds in this world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">830</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Yerushalmi, Brachot 2:8</i> He picks them to manifests His light within them. This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">831</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:4</i> “You who adhere (<i>HaDveikim</i>-<i>הדבקים</i>) to <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i> are all alive today,” referring to complete and direct adhesion (<i>Dveikut</i>) to the light of the ten <i>Sefirot</i>, which does not apply to any other creatures. This is as is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">832</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 13:11</i> “For just as a belt is fastened to a man’s loins, so I fastened the entire house of Israel to Myself.”",
                    "With all the above in mind, the matter of the good inclination (<i>Yetzer HaTov</i>) and the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>) within man, has also been explained and understood. For, these are two forms (<i>Yetzirot</i>) that were added to man in addition to his soul-<i>Neshamah</i>. The good inclination (<i>Yetzer HaTov</i>) is a radiance that comes from the light of the angels, whereas the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>) is a radiance that comes from the light of the external shells (<i>Kelipot</i>), and constitutes the external shell (<i>Kelipah</i>) of the good inclination (<i>Yetzer HaTov</i>).",
                    "However, the soul (<i>Neshamah</i>) of man is itself the innermost of them all. Thus, because it is innermost and also is called the essential self (<i>Atzmut</i>) of man, he therefore possesses the free choice to turn them to whichever place he desires, since he is greater than them all. His soul primarily leans toward the good inclination (<i>Yetzer HaTov</i>), since the good inclination is holy like himself. Moreover, it also is juxtaposed in close proximity to him. However, his body, primarily leans toward the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>), since both the body and the evil inclination are juxtaposed in close proximity to each other. Thus, it is primarily here that there is a battle between the substance (<i>Chomer</i>) and the soul (<i>Neshamah</i>). For, since the soul (<i>Neshamah</i>) can only fulfill the <i>mitzvot</i> through the medium of the body (<i>Guf</i>) which, in and of itself, primary leans toward the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>), it is here that there is great difficulty in subduing it.",
                    "We thus have explained that it is within the free choice of the soul (<i>Neshamah</i>) to lean toward the good inclination (<i>Yetzer HaTov</i>). However, because the soul requires the body (<i>Guf</i>) to act, great toil is necessary to subdue the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>). Understand all this very well. Also understand that after a person passes from this world, neither the soul (<i>Neshamah</i>) nor the body (<i>Guf</i>) are judged until they manifest together, as they were when he was alive, as our sages, of blessed memory, explained with the analogy of the lame man on the shoulders of the blind man.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">833</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Sanhedrin 91a-b; Midrash Vayikra Rabba 4:5; Zohar Chadash Ruth 38b; Sefer HaMashalim of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as The Book of Allegories, 110 – When the body and soul are judged on account of sin, they are like a blind man and a lame man who the king gave the responsibility of guarding an orchard, but they blundered and did not properly guard it. When HaShem, blessed is He, brings about judgment, the soul declares, “It was not I who blundered. It was the body, that possesses an evil inclination that makes it sin.” On the other hand, the body declares, “Were it not for the soul I could not have sinned, for a body without a soul is as lifeless as an inanimate stone. Without the soul who moves me, I cannot make even the slightest move.” The two are analogous to a blind man and a lame man who the king charged with guarding his orchard, but they transgressed and ate of its fruits. When the king brought them to judgment the blind man said, “I couldn’t have eaten them, for I could not see where they were,” and the lame man said, “I couldn’t have eaten them, for I could not go to where they were.” What did the king do? He put the lame man on the blind man’s shoulders and said, “The two of you joined in partnership to transgress my will, for you provided the eyes and you provided the legs and both of you ate of the fruits. Therefore, you will be punished together.” In the same manner, HaShem, blessed is He, joined the soul to the body and advised them that if they sin before Him, they will be regarded as a partnership. Regarding this, the Psalmist stated (Psalms 50:4), “He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that He may judge His people.” The words “He calls to the heavens above” refer to the soul, as we see that the numerical value of the heavens-HaShamayim-השמים-395 is equal to the soul-Neshamah-נשמה-395. The words, “And to the earth” refer to the body, which was taken from the earth. We thus see that both the soul and the body are brought as one in judgement before HaShem, blessed is He.</i>",
                    "We now will explain the answer to the first two questions, namely, why was it necessary for man to be created in this world with a soul and a body, and why are there two forms in him, the good inclination (<i>Yetzer HaTov</i>) and the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>). We also will answer the questions that arise from the verses,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">834</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 68:35</i> “Give strength to God,” and,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">835</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:18</i> “You have weakened the Rock who bore you,” and the like.",
                    "Now, at the outset of creation, all the worlds were created in the order mentioned above, and were brought into being by the power of the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i>, blessed is He, by the power of His simple will, as an altruistic act of kindness. However, it subsequently is also necessary to continually draw forth sustenance, vitality and influence to all the worlds, in order to sustain their existence just as they were when they were created, and no more. This is like the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">836</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 3:14</i> “I realized that whatever God does will endure forever: Nothing can be added to it and nothing can be subtracted from it.” It similarly states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">837</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 1:9</i> “There is nothing new under the sun,” and,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">838</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 2:2</i> “On the seventh day God completed His work which He had done etc.,” all of which refer to the matter of creation itself.",
                    "Nevertheless, from that point forward, their deeds are necessary to draw forth their vitality, so that they can sustain themselves, similar to the matter of how when a child matures, he sustains himself and no longer eats at the table of his father. However, the ten <i>Sefirot</i> do not require man’s deeds, since all the influence that is necessary to sustain them when they were emanated, is constantly drawn to them from the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i>, blessed is He. For, about the ten <i>Sefirot</i> the verse states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">839</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 5:5</i> “Evil shall not abide with You,” in that they require no additional rectification through man’s deeds. However, this is not so of the created beings, including the aspect of the souls (<i>Neshamot</i>) and everything external to them, which are intermingled with good and evil. They therefore require deed and rectification.",
                    "Even so, from another angle, namely, when there is a diminishment in the bestowal of influence to the created beings, this gives the appearance that the power and ability of the ten <i>Sefirot</i> is diminished,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">840</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Also see Sefer HaMashalim of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as The Book of Allegories 1-4.</i> God forbid to think that there is any actual diminishment, for one might err and think that this is why they do not bestow influence. Because of this the verse states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">841</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 32:18</i> “You have weakened The Rock who bore you,” and the opposite,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">842</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 68:35</i> “Give strength to God.”",

                    "Now, in regard to why it was necessary to create man, who includes all the creations and emanations and binds all the worlds together until the very depth of the earth, this is because, as mentioned above, he is the closest being to receive influence from the ten <i>Sefirot</i>, and thus, through rectifying his deeds, he draws influence from the ten <i>Sefirot</i> to himself, and from him to the angels, and from the angels to the husks of <i>Kelipah</i>, so that he can rectify whatever is refinable in them, as will be explained regarding the matter of the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>), and from them he draws influence to the worlds themselves, which are the vessels and bodies of each particular world. On the other hand, if he sins, he then ruins all the worlds, God forbid.",
                    "We thus have clearly explained why man must be created in this lowly world, with a body and a soul, and with both a good inclination (<i>Yetzer HaTov</i>) and an evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>). Another related reason regarding the matter of the evil inclination, is that this inclination is essential to man, in that he must procreate and eat etc., all of which must be done in purity. This also is necessary to each and every world, to draw down influences that becomes tangible within them for the purpose of the vessels of that world, which are the actual worlds themselves. For, these influences are more refined than the vessels, and are themselves part and parcel of the levels of creation. Understand this well.",
                    "We thus find that it was necessary for man to be composed of all the worlds, and that they assist him in his deeds, to draws down influence, both to himself and to them. This is because, in and of themselves, they are powerless to draw down influence. Therefore, if man sins, all the worlds are ruined and punished by a diminishment of influence in them, being that they did not assist him in desisting from evil. Understand this well.

                    "We thus have explained that man includes all the worlds within himself, about which it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">850</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ecclesiastes 12:13; See Talmud Bavli, Shabbat 30b</i> “For this is the whole of man.” This is also the inner meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">851</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 1:26</i> “Let us make man in Our image, after Our likeness,” and is why the word, “Let us make-<i>Na’aseh</i>-<i>נעשה</i>,” is in the plural form, since all worlds are partners, both in his making and in his deeds.

This is why the verse concludes with the words, “You are My people (<i>Ami Atah</i>-<i>עמי אתה</i>),” which can be read, “You are with Me (<i>Eemee Atah</i>-<i>עמי אתה</i>),” which as our sages, of blessed memory stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">857</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See introduction to Zohar; Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 69 and elsewhere.</i> means “My partner.” That is, “I create them and you sustain them.”",

In fact, what arises from everything we said, is that contrary to popular belief, prophecy must necessarily be found in the world, so that man will straighten and repair his deeds and thus draw beneficence to all worlds, so that they will not be nullified out of existence, God forbid. This is as written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">862</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Job 33:15-17</i> “In a dream, a vision of the night, when a deep sleep falls over people, during slumbers on the bed, then He uncovers people’s ears and seals their affliction, to divert a person from his planned action and to suppress pride from man.”",

                    "We thus find that prophecy (<i>Nevuah</i>) and the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) must necessarily be found in the world, and are easy to attain, on condition that there are people who are fitting for it. However, this is impossible for a blemished soul. We therefore must explain what obstructs this.",
                    "When the influence of the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach</i> <i>HaKodesh</i>) is roused to descend to man and dwell upon him, if he is a sinner, the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer</i>) causes there to be a dark veil that separates between his intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet</i>) and the source of the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>). About this the verse states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">866</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 59:2</i> “Rather, only your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your transgressions have caused Him to hide His face from you etc.” Thus, the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) of Divine Inspiration does not rest upon him, because of transgressing the 365 prohibitions that blemish the intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet</i>), as discussed in section of one of this book.",
                    "Moreover, even if the blemish is only caused by not fulfilling any of the 248 positive commandments, which he could have done, but did not do, he is a “<i>Baal Moom</i> – a blemished person,” and Supernal beneficence is not drawn to his intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet</i>), being that there is a limb or organ that is ruined and he is a blemished person. However, if the blemish is below, in the elemental soul (<i>Nefesh HaYesodeet</i>), whether because of the bad character traits of his animate soul (<i>Nefesh Chayah</i>) or whether because of having eaten forbidden foods, which cause his vegetative soul (<i>Nefesh HaTzomachat</i>) to be repulsive and the like, then the lower power will not be roused to draw down Supernal beneficence, and itself becomes a separating veil there. There then will be no arousal from below to ascend and draw down beneficence from Above to below.",
                    "We thus find that there are various kinds of separating veils. There could be a separating veil between the vegetative soul (<i>Nefesh HaTzomachat</i>) and that which is above it, because of the blemish of having eaten forbidden foods, which gave vitality to his vegetative soul (<i>Nefesh HaTzomachat</i>). It could be because of bad character traits or sins that are motivated by lust that arouses and blemishes the animate soul (<i>Nefesh HaChayah</i>). If they are sins of speech, they blemish the speaking soul (<i>Nefesh HaMedaberet</i>) from which they stem, and if they are sins of thought, they blemish the intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet</i>). Now, understand that as we already explained, all these blemishes are only in that particular spark of that particular soul, in each particular level of each particular world. At times, if the blemishes have become strengthened by force of habit, because of the above-mentioned separating veil, the bond of that soul can become cut off from the body of the tree, which is called, “the light of the source of the souls.” This is the inner meaning of what our sages, of blessed memory, stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">867</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 18b</i> “The wicked are called ‘dead’ even while they are alive.”",
                    "Now, as already explained, not all blemishes are equal. There are blemishes that effect the vegetative soul (<i>Tzomachat</i>), there are blemishes that effect the animate soul (<i>Chayah</i>), there are blemishes that effect the speaking soul (<i>Medaberet</i>) and there are blemishes that effect the intellectual soul (<i>Seechleet</i>). However, regarding the matter of drawing down the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) and receiving Divine inspiration, it makes no difference where the blemish is. As long as there is blemish, the Holy Spirit (<i>Ruach</i> <i>HaKodesh</i>) will not be drawn down and he will have no Divine inspiration at all. Therefore, whosoever comes to purify himself, must ensure that all levels of his soul are as clean and pure as clear glass, free of any sicknesses of the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>) in all levels of his soul. About this Moshe was told,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">868</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 3:5</i> “Remove your shoes from your feet.” That is, he was told that all the limbs of his body and all the powers of his soul, on all the above-mentioned levels, down to the soles of his feet, must be refined and pure, empty of any dross of the coarse and gross substance, as mentioned in Sefer Tikkunim.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">869</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Zohar Tikkunim, Tikkun 12 and Tikkun 21</i> That is, there should not remain any of the contamination of the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>) in him whatsoever, but rather, only its good portion, which has been extracted and refined, should remain, meaning, that which is necessary to sustain the body and nothing more. There then is no obstruction or hinderance to separate between the powers of the soul and their source in the light of the source of the souls, which adheres to the source of the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) in the light of the ten <i>Sefirot</i>.",
                    "We have thus explained that blemish causes two evils. The first is that the yearning and desire of the lower being cannot ascend to the source of the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>), and as a result, the Supernal Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) also cannot spread down to the lower being. All this comes about because of the veil caused by transgression, as mentioned before. Now, the blemish is caused by force of the strong bond between the inanimate body of the inanimate soul (<i>Nefesh HaDomem</i>) which is extremely bonded to the body itself, since the body is the vessel and vehicle through which the soul manifests all its various powers. However, it is not necessarily so that all the powers of the soul are found in every blemish. That is, there are blemishes that damage the vegetative aspect (<i>Tzomachat</i>), there are those that damage the animate aspect (<i>Chayah</i>), there are those that damage the speaking aspect (<i>Medaberet</i>) and those that damage the intellectual aspect (<i>Seechleet</i>), as mentioned before. However, since they all come about through the agency of the powers of the inanimate soul (<i>Nefesh HaDomemet</i>) and the body (<i>Guf</i>), therefore every kind of sin in the world involves and blemishes the inanimate soul and the body."

                    "<b>The Conditions to attaining Prophecy</b>",
                    "We will now explain the conditions to attaining prophecy with great brevity. It was already explained that there are blemishes that damage the vegetative soul (<i>Tzomachat</i>), those that damage the animate soul (<i>Chayah</i>), those that damage the speaking soul (<i>Medaberet</i>) and those that damage the intellectual soul (<i>Seechleet</i>), and that one must refine them all. This being so, the first thing he must do is repent from every kind of sin or negative character trait, with complete repentance, and never return to them whatsoever. Afterwards, he must be careful in fulfilling all the 248 positive commandments that are possible to fulfill in our days, as explained in the first part of this book. Most particularly, he must set fixed times for the study of Torah, day and night, and should not diminish or depart from them, even for a single day. He should pray three times daily with complete devotional intent (<i>Kavanah</i>). He must honor the Shabbat in all its details. He should fulfill the <i>mitzvah</i> of loving his fellow Jew wholeheartedly and should fulfill the <i>mitzvot</i> of reciting the <i>Shema</i> and don <i>Tzitzit</i> and <i>Tefillin</i> when he prays.",
                    "Afterwards, he should be cautious not to sin in any of the 365 prohibitive <i>mitzvot</i>, even in the stringencies enacted by the sages. He must especially avoid the transgression of any sins for which the punishment is excision (<i>Karet</i>), death by the hands of heaven, or death by the hands of the earthly court. He certainly must guard himself from transgressing any negative commandments, but should be especially careful with the following: Gossip, evil speech, idle chatter, mockery and frivolity, gazing at women, any manner of forbidden seminal emission, distancing himself from his wife during her menstrual period, any oaths even if they are true, and above all, keeping the Shabbat.",
                    "He likewise should guard himself from any indecent character traits, for they contaminate his elemental soul. He should particularly guard himself from haughtiness and arrogance to the utmost degree, to the point that he should be like the lower stoop upon which everyone treads. Lowliness should literally be embedded in his heart, to the point that he neither feels any joy when honored, nor any disgrace when shamed. The two should literally be equal in his eyes. Moreover, he should utterly distance himself from anger, to the point that even if someone slaps his face, he does not become angered. This is because nothing obstructs the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) more than anger. He likewise should utterly distance himself from pedantry, even in relation to members of his own household. Similarly, he should utterly avoid sadness and depression, being that prophecy cannot rest upon a person who is sad and depressed, even if he is worthy of it. He should rather be happy with his lot, even when suffering befalls him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">870</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 54a</i> as explained about the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">871</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 6:5</i> “And you shall love <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your being.”",
                    "After all this, he should engage in the study of Torah completely for its sake (<i>Lishmah</i>),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">872</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained at the conclusion of Part 1, Gate 3, this means, for the sake of the Name of HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He.</i> doing so with all his strength, solely to bring delight to the One who formed him. When engaging in the study of Torah and the fulfillment of the <i>mitzvot</i>, he should be joyous to the ultimate extreme, as written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">873</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 119:162</i> “I rejoice in Your words like one who has discovered vast treasure,” for, through this, he draws down beneficence to all the worlds. Of primary importance over everything, is to fear <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. This should be constant, at every moment, and he thus will be free of sin. This is accomplished by literally placing <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה before his very eyes at every moment, as written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">874</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Psalms 16:8</i> “I have set <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה before me always.” He should actively focus his thoughts on <i>HaShem</i>-יהו\"ה, blessed is He, adhering them to Him unceasingly, without stopping for even a moment.

                    "<b>The Nature of Prophecy and what it is</b>",
                    "We already explained that there is one light, in the form of man (<i>Adam</i>-אדם), that spreads forth in all four worlds of Emanation, Creation, Formation, and Action (<i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah</i>, <i>Asiyah</i>), until the end of the four foundational elements of this lowly world. This light adheres to the lights of Supernal Man, which is called the ten <i>Sefirot</i>, and they manifest within the light that is called, “the light of the source of the souls,” within which all the lower souls are included. When they descend to this world to manifest in bodies, they leave their roots, from where they were hewn, which remain in a state of adhesion above, and only the branches of those roots alone descend in a manner of spreading down. These aspects alone manifest in bodies in this world. This is compared to the branches of a tree that are bound to the tree and adhere to it, and are literally rooted in the trunk of the tree. Nonetheless, they extend and bend down, to the point that even though they are attached to the trunk of the tree, they touch the ground. When a person commits a sin for which he is liable of excision (<i>Karet</i>), that branch becomes severed from the body of the tree and remains separate from it. It thus remains fixed in this world like the spirit of an animal. This is the meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">877</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 15:31</i> “For he scorned the word of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה and broke His commandment; that person will surely be cut off, his sin is upon him.” This is also the inner meaning of the words,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">878</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 20:19</i> “For man is the tree of the field.”",
                    "This is also the meaning of those verses that relate to the righteous, in which their name is doubled. For example,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">879</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 22:11</i> “Avraham, Avraham,” and,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">880</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 46:2</i> “Yaakov, Yaakov,” and<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">881</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 3:4</i> “Moshe, Moshe.” That is, one of these names corresponds to the aspect of the root that remains above in adhesion to the tree, and this aspect is called the flow from above (<i>Mazal</i>) of a person. This is as our sages, of blessed memory, related,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">882</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Menachot 29b</i> that Moshe saw the flow from above (<i>Mazal</i>) of Rabbi Akiva sitting and expounding the thorns of the letters. For, it is from there that the beneficence flows to the branch that descended to manifest in the body.",
                    "Now, the root is very lofty and is at the very beginning and heights of the world of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>. The branch is very long and spreads down through all the worlds, until its end manifests within the body. In each level of each world, it sets a root, so that there is not a single soul that does not have roots to no end, one above the other, in all levels of all the worlds, and through man’s deeds he merits to elevate them all. That is, all the levels of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>, the roots that he leaves there, are altogether called a single, complete soul-<i>Nefesh</i> of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>. The same likewise applies to all the other levels.",
                    "With the above in mind, the matter of prophecy (<i>Nevuah</i>) becomes understood. For, when a person is in a refined state, free of the contamination of the evil inclination (<i>Yetzer HaRa</i>) and the powers of his elemental soul (<i>Nefesh HaYesodeet</i>) are completely unaffected by the evil inclination, nor does he have any sins that blemish any of the roots of his soul, if he then prepares himself to adhere to the most supernal root of his soul, he has the ability to do so. Nevertheless, even though he may be fitting that the spirit of prophecy (<i>Nevuah</i>) should rest upon him, he nonetheless must utterly divest and separate himself from all matters of gross substance and physicality. He will then be able to adhere to his spiritual soul root.",
                    "Now, this divestment, as discussed in holy books on the matter of prophecy and the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>), is not a literal divestment, in that his soul does not actually depart from his body as it does during sleep, for if so, it is not prophecy (<i>Nevuah</i>), but merely a dream, like any other dream. In contrast, when the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) rests upon man, his soul is manifest within his body in a conscious waking state, and does not depart from him.",
                    "Rather, what is meant by divestment here, is that he removes all of his own thoughts completely. That is, though he has the power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>) in him, which is drawn from his animate soul (<i>Nefesh HaChayah</i>), he causes this power to stop imagining, thinking or ruminating over any matters of this lowly world, as if his soul has left him. He then transforms the power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>) of his thoughts and directs it to depict his ascent, as though he is ascending in the roots of his soul in the upper worlds, ascending from one level to the next, until his power of depiction arrives at its Supernal source. The forms of all these lights should be engraved in his thoughts, just as he sees when his power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>) pictures matters of this world in his mind. That is, though he does not actually see them, he sees them in his mind, as known in the natural sciences.",
                    "He should then have intention to receive light and illumination from the ten <i>Sefirot</i>, particularly from that point where his soul is bound, which is the root of his soul. He also should have the intention of elevating the ten <i>Sefirot</i>, causing them to ascend one to the other, until they reach the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i> Himself, blessed is He, and then draw illumination from there, in a manner of descent, all the way down until they reach the very end, here below. When light is drawn down to the <i>Sefirot</i> by his hand, they greatly rejoice, and become illuminated by the light that he drew down from the root of his soul, which is bound with them, according to the measure that is appropriate to it.",
                    "He then should intend to descend from level to level until the light and bestowal of influence reaches his intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet</i>) in his body, and from there, it reaches his animate soul (<i>Nefesh HaChayah</i>) and his power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>). His power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach</i> <i>HaMedameh</i>) will then depict these matters in physical form and he will understand them as though he literally saw them with his physical eyes.",
                    "At times, this light will descend and be depicted in his power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>) as the appearance of an angel who speaks to him, and he sees him or hears his voice and the like, with one of the known refined senses of the power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>) of the soul. From there, they will be transferred and copied by the five external senses, since they too are part of the animate soul (<i>Nefesh HaChayah</i>), as known. At such times he will see, hear, smell or speak with his actual physical senses, as written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">883</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Samuel II 23:2</i> “The spirit of <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i> spoke within me and His word is upon my tongue.” For, that light will materialize and be given form by the physical senses. At other times, his prophecy may solely be through the five spiritual senses of the power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>) alone. All these matters happen when the power of imagination becomes completely divested and emptied of coarse material thoughts, as mentioned above.",
                    "We thus find that prophecy, though different, is similar to a dream, in which one’s intellectual soul departs from him and ascends above, going from level to level, and from there he sees and gazes, after which he returns to descend and bestow this light to the animate soul (<i>Nefesh HaChayah</i>), this being the soul that has the power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>). It is there, in the animate soul (<i>Nefesh</i> <i>HaChaya</i>) that the matters that he perceived become further materialized and depicted. Then, when a person awakens, the soul recalls those matters through the power of retention (<i>Ko’ach HaShomer</i>) and the power of memory (<i>Ko’ach HaZocher</i>), which also are part of the animate soul (<i>Nefesh HaChayah</i>), as known in the natural sciences.",
                    "We thus have clearly explained the matter of prophecy and the matter of dreams. That is, prophecy occurs while the soul is still conscious within his body, whereas dreams occur when the soul departs and is not conscious within the body. Nevertheless, in prophecy itself, there are two types.",
                    "The first type is the prophecy of all prophets other than our teacher Moshe. Namely, when the light is bestowed, and in its descent, reaches the intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet</i>) of the prophet, and from there descends to his animate soul (<i>Nefesh HaChayah</i>), and there to depict with the five inner senses of his power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>), his external senses would shudder and tremble, causing him to collapse. This is because his external physical senses do not have the capacity to receive such a light or to depict it in physical form. Such prophecy is called a dream (<i>Chalom</i>), even though, as we mentioned above, it actually is not a dream. An example of such prophecy is the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">884</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 15:12</i> “And a deep sleep fell upon Avram.”",
                    "The second type of prophecy is complete and perfected, in which one’s physical senses do not shudder or collapse at all. Rather, the matter is depicted within him in a settled manner. This was the level of prophecy of our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him. The reason is because, due to the holiness of his deeds, since his physical substance was so completely refined, it was actually transformed and ascended to the level of the soul (<i>Nefesh</i>). This is because he entirely removed contamination from himself and all that remained was the refined and good aspect of both his elemental soul and his body, being that it is only in them that there is an aspect of physicality, which is not so of the intellectual soul and higher.",
                    "Now, we already explained that the soul of man possesses roots to no end. Thus, according to the level from where his soul was hewn, will be his power to draw down the beneficence of his prophecy. Nevertheless, even if the root from where his soul was hewn is extremely lofty, if he has not rectified and refined all of the levels from there down, he only will be able to draw the influence of his prophecy from that level that he has rectified and refined, and no higher. This being the case, it should be clearly understood that there are many levels, to no end, amongst the prophets.",
                    "However, do not think that since we explained that the soul of a prophet does not depart from his body, then what grasp can he possibly have in his thought of the intangible, to ascend and be able to open the gates etc., for this is understood according to what I wrote above. Namely, that the soul is like a very long branch that spreads down from its root where it adheres to the tree, and from there it descends all the way down to one’s body, and by way of that line, which is always drawn down, he can ascend. That is, when a person yearns to ascend to his root, then the light of his thought – which is called the comprehended intellect (<i>Mooskal</i>) – ascends from the thinker (<i>Maskeel</i>), which is the intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaMaskelet</i>), to the intellect itself (<i>Sechel</i>), which is the upper root of his soul. Through the thought and conceptualization, itself, which is the influence that is drawn down from the intellect (<i>Sechel</i>) to the thinker (<i>Maskeel</i>), they adhere to each other and become one. We thus find that the comprehended intellect (<i>Mooskal</i>) is the light and influence itself, which descends from the intellect (<i>Sechel</i>) to the intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaMaskelet</i>). This tangible influence and light itself, is the matter called thought (<i>Machshavah</i>). Understand this well, for I am not telling you this in vain. For, if you think that this is not so, you thereby have rendered everything that relates to the devotional intentions that one is meant to have during prayer meaningless, as well as rendering all the thoughts and ruminations of man meaningless, be they good or evil.",
                    "We thus have explained that prophecy is both necessary and possible, and that it is like a person who holds on to the end of a branch of a tree that is bent down, shaking it strongly, so that the whole tree shakes. However, know that the Supernal aspects are not shaken by the thoughts of man, except if he is fitting to draw down an even the higher light to them. In which case, by virtue of their great joy, they too draw down light to him from that supernal light. If, however, he in unfitting and does not have the ability to draw down the Supernal light to them, then they take no consideration of him whatsoever, nor do they desire to come close to him and assist him by drawing his thoughts Above, being that his thoughts are empty and of no benefit."

                    "The explanation of the matter is that the prophecy of the prophets was as follows: We explained before that the four worlds are called Emanation, Creation, Formation and Action (<i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah</i>, and <i>Asiyah</i>), and that below them all is this lowly world, which is divided into the four elemental foundations, including the elemental foundations themselves and their elemental soul powers, and that they are divided in a manner similar to the ten <i>Sefirot</i>.",
                    "We also explained that in each world there is an inner light, which is their ten <i>Sefirot</i>, and that external to them is the light of the source of the souls, and external to that is the light of the source of the angels, and external to that is the dark light, which is the source of the shells (<i>Kelipot</i>), and external to that is the world itself, which are the firmaments of that world. We explained that the same is so of this lowly world, literally. For, the substance of the four elemental foundations constitutes the body of the world, and within it are the other lights, each one of which includes the four aspects of the elemental soul.",

                    "The manner of prophecy itself was also explained in the fifth gate. Namely, it was explained that the thoughts of the prophet become divested of matters of the world and ascend from level to level, from below to above, until he reaches the place where the root of his soul adheres. He then intends to elevate the light of the <i>Sefirot</i> to the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i>, blessed is He, and to draw down light from there. He then returns and brings it down from above to below, within the levels by which he ascended, until it reaches down to his intellectual soul (<i>Nefesh HaSeechleet</i>), which takes its portion of that light according to the measure of the bond of the root of his soul above. Then, from there, he draws it down further to the power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>) of his animate soul (<i>Nefesh Chayah</i>). There the matter becomes depicted in the inner senses of the power of imagination (<i>Ko’ach HaMedameh</i>) or in its external, physical senses.",
                    "Now, in regard to the drawing down of that thought, it certainly did not ascend by itself, but only through known intentions (<i>Kavanot</i>) and unifications (<i>Yichudim</i>) that were transmitted to him by the prophet who is his teacher in prophecy. This is the matter of the students of the prophets, as we find with Shmuel, Eliyahu and Elisha, who are remembered for good. That is, the students of the prophets were trained, so that through the unifications (<i>Yichudim</i>) that they would make, they would draw down light and influence according to <i>HaShem’s-יהו\"ה</i> will, which is the ultimate aspect of prophecy.",

This is as discussed in Zohar to Parshat Vayakhel 201b, regarding the matter of the ascent of prayers, and is also mentioned in Pirkei Heichalot and their Beraitot. They first would use these names to open the gates of that level, and would then make the unification (<i>Yichud</i>) and pray the prayer appropriate to that level, thus ascending from level to level, until they reached their upper root, where they would rest. They would then draw their thoughts to the Unlimited One, <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, and then draw the influence down below, as mentioned before.",
                    "The explanation of the matter of the gates and names, is that they would use the power of a holy name that relates to the <i>Sefirah</i> of that level, to bind by oath, the angel that is rooted to that level. That angel is appointed to guard the gate of that firmament itself, which is the substance (<i>Chomer</i>) of that level, and the gate also has a known name, which the angel would open. The thought of that prophet would then ascend by way of that gate from one light to the next light, until it reached the inner light of the <i>Sefirah</i> of that level itself. He would then pray and make the unification (<i>Yichud</i>) needed for that level, and in this manner, he would ascend from level to level.",

Our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, would ascend all the way to the world of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>, and from there he saw. However, even his perception was only of the world of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i> as it becomes garbed in the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, and this too, he only saw in a passing manner. For, to grasp the world of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i> itself is impossible, which is the inner meaning of the verse,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">899</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 33:20</i> “For no man can see Me and live.” The other prophets, on the other hand, would only see the world of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i> through its complete manifestation within the lights of the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i>.",
                    "However, the prophecy of Yechezkel<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">900</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel</i> was after the destruction of the Temple, and therefore his prophecy was of the world of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i>, after its manifestation in the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i> and the world of Creation-<i>Briyah</i>, as it was completely manifest within the world of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i>. From that point on, the light of the worlds of Emanation-<i>Atzilut</i> and Creation-<i>Briyah</i> were not revealed at all. About this our sages, of blessed memory, said<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">901</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Talmud Bavli, Sotah 48b</i> that after Chagai, Zachariah, and Malachi, prophecy ceased altogether. Rather, all that remains is the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) of Divine inspiration, which is only the drawing down of the lights of the world of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i> themselves, and from there down. In the language of the Talmud,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">902</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 14b</i> this is called, “ascending to the Pardes,” which is the world of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i> and is called the world of Metatron-<i>מטטרו״ן.</i> For this too, there were known methods of opening the gates that exist between the lowly world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> and the world of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i>, and there were unifications (<i>Yichudim</i>) and prayers (<i>Tefillot</i>) appropriate to the world of Formation-<i>Yetzirah</i> and its ten <i>Sefirot</i>.",

However, the manner of these methods was subsequently forgotten as well. Additionally, in the time of Rava and Abaye, who were <i>Amora’im</i>, they also lost the ability to become purified through the ashes of the Red Heifer, as mentioned in Talmud.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">903</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tamud Bavli, Sanhedrin 65b</i> Thus, from that point on, they no longer made use of the methods of ascending into the Pardes.",
                    "From then on, they only made use of the methods of ascending to the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>, and nothing more. However, because Action<i>-Asiyah</i> is the lowest of the four world, and additionally, because the angels of the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> themselves are composed of a majority of evil with a minority of good, and moreover, because the good and evil in them greatly adhere to each other, therefore there is no Godly comprehension and grasp in the world of Action<i>-Asiyah,</i> being that it is impossible to only grasp the good in it. Therefore, whatever grasp there is, is an admixture of good and evil, truth and false.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">904</sup><i class=\"footnote\">[The following passage from the Zohar, which is included as a note in this section, appears to either be an addition from an alternate manuscript, or added by the Chida]: This is similarly stated in Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 66 (97a), as follows: Rabbi Shimon said, “Woe to those people who set aside engagement in the study of the Torah, about which it states (Genesis 3:22), ‘And he shall take also of the Tree of Life,’ and engagement in the mitzvot, which are the fruit of the tree, about which it states (Gen. 3:22 ibid.), ‘and he shall eat and live forever.’ Woe to those who instead follow after those who entice them, who are from the side of the primordial snake (Nachash HaKadmoni). They entice them, telling them, “Come and learn how to command the angels who rule over the stars and the sun and the moon, and those who are appointed over the evil spirits and demons, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” It is about such people that it states (See Deuteronomy 17:3; Kings II 23:5; Jeremiah 44), “So says HaShem-יהו״ה to those who sacrifice and offer incense to the stars and constellations, to the sun and moon, and to all the hosts of the heavens; something that I never commanded.” The engagement in such matters is forbidden by the Holy One, blessed is He, as He commanded Adam (Genesis 2:17), “But as for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it etc.” Yeshu the wicked one, made use of this knowledge, and the same is so of the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion. The Holy One, blessed is He, uprooted them all from this world and from the coming world, as it states (Genesis 2:17), “On the day that you eat of it, die you shall surely die (Mot Tamut-מות תמות).” That is, “you shall die” (Mot-מות) in this world and “you shall surely die” (Tamut-תמות) in the coming world. This sin of making use of the holy names to command angels and demons is what brought about the destruction of the first Holy Temple and the exile of the Jewish people among the nations of the world, through which many were killed. For, each man sacrificed and offered incense to angels and demons, and drew the powers of impurity upon themselves. When the prophets would come and chastise them, the verse (Kings II 17:13-14) attests that they did not listen to the voice of the prophets and the seers. How would the prophet chastise them? He would tell them, “Repent and do Teshuvah, and if not, there will be the fulfillment of the verse (Deuteronomy 11:17), ‘He will restrain the heaven so that there will be no rain, and the ground will not yield its produce, and you will be swiftly banished from the goodly Land that HaShem-יהו״ה gives you.’” They, however, made light of the words of the prophet, and ridiculed him, saying, “We need not be concerned with your words, as we will command the angels who are appointed over the rain, and we will force them to bring forth the rain.” However, because of them, the Holy One, blessed is He, exchanged His appointed angels in their tasks, and they were instead killed and the Holy Temple was destroyed because of them, and it is because of them that the Jewish people were exiled. This was the sin of Adam, through which the snake caused death to him and his wife. He enticed them with that tree, as written (Genesis 3:5), “God knows that on the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God etc.” For this reason, the Holy One, blessed is He, commands man and tells him to contemplate that which is permitted to be contemplated, but not engage in hidden matters (See Deuteronomy 29:28).</i>",
                    "This refers to the secrets of the Kabbalah of Action (<i>Kabbalah Ma’aseet</i>).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">905</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Others often referred to this as “Practical Kabbalah.” However, the more appropriate and proper translation would be “The Kabbalah of Action,” and it is called so because it relates to the world of Action-Asiyah, as stated above by Rabbi Chaim Vital, of righteous memory.</i> (This is written about in various books, and is called the Kabbalah of Action-<i>Kabbalah Ma’aseet</i> because it is in the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i>.) It is specifically because of this that it is forbidden to make use of it. For, in doing so, one necessarily also comes to adhere to the evil that adheres to the good. Thus, though in his mind he thinks he is coming to purify his soul, in actually, he causes his soul to become dirty and soiled on account of the evil. Moreover, even if he does come to have some grasp, in reality, he grasps an admixture of truth mixed with error. This is especially so nowadays, when we do not have the ashes of the Red Heifer, and the impurities of the shells of <i>Kelipah</i> adhere to whoever attempts to come close by way of the Kabbalah of Action (<i>Kabbalah Ma’aseet</i>). Therefore, whoever cares about his soul will distance himself from this. For, aside for the fact that he will contaminate himself and cause impurity upon his soul, he will also be punished in Purgatory (<i>Gehinom</i>). Moreover, he will even be punished in this world, as we have a received tradition in our hands, that either he or his offspring will become impoverished, or he or his offspring will be afflicted with illness, or he or his offspring will become apostates, heaven forbid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">906</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As written at the end of Sefer Chassidim and in Brit Menuchah.</i>",
                    "Take reproof from the case of Rabbi Yosef de la Reina and Rabbi Shlomo Molcho, who made use of the Kabbalah of Action (<i>Kabbalah Ma’aseet</i>). In the end they were lost from the world, all because of the above-mentioned reason, that in the world of Action-<i>Asiyah</i> there cannot be a grasp of good that is not accompanied by evil. Moreover, they made them take oaths against their will, and then enticed and deceived them into paths that are the opposite of goodness, to the point that their souls were destroyed.",
                    "Beyond all these reasons, the early sages concealed the manner of how to bind the angels by oaths, and as a result, we are not expert in them or in their usage. It therefore is appropriate for a person to distance himself from such matters to the ultimate degree."

Namely, one should return to <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, with a very great repentance-<i>Teshuvah</i> over everything that he ruined.

Moreover, he should minimize his pleasures, such as only eating and drinking enough to maintain his health. He should rise from his bed at midnight or slightly earlier, and also distance himself from any unbecoming character traits. Likewise, he should separate himself from others, so as to not engage in mundane matters such as idle chatter. Subsequently, he should work to purify his body, regularly immersing himself in the ritual bath (<i>Mikvah</i>). Afterwards, he should occasionally go into seclusion, and at such times, contemplate specifically on matters that bring to fear of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He. He should set <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה before his eyes constantly, and should take care to ensure that his thoughts remain entirely empty of all of vanities of this lowly world. Instead, he should adhere to love of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, with great yearning and desire.

                    "The second is through engaging in Torah study or fulfilling a particular <i>mitzvah</i>, about which our sages, of blessed memory, explained,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">911</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah Avot 4:11</i> “Whoever fulfills one commandment, acquires one advocate for himself,” meaning that an angel is formed by it, in the most literal sense. However, this is on condition that he fulfills it constantly and does so with much devotional intent (<i>Kavanah</i>), being careful to fulfill it meticulously according to Torah law (<i>Halachah</i>). In such a case, the angel that was formed through the <i>mitzvah</i> or the Torah study can come and be revealed to him.

As known, this <i>Tzaddik</i> could possibly be of the same root as his soul, or even if he is from another root, he becomes revealed to him because he fulfilled a particular <i>mitzvah</i> in a perfected manner, similar to how this <i>Tzaddik</i> fulfilled it.

He should then close his eyes and divest his thoughts of all matters of this world, as though his soul has left him, so that he is like a dead person who no longer has any feelings for this world at all. He should then strengthen himself with great yearning and desire to think about matters of the upper world, and to bring his soul to adhere to the roots of his soul and the supernal upper lights of <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i>, blessed is He. He should picture it to himself as if his soul has left him and is ascending above, and he should picture the upper worlds as though he is actually present within them. If he makes a unification (<i>Yichud</i>), he should think about it in such a manner, that through it, he draws down Godly light and influence to all the worlds, and he should have in mind that he too should receive his portion of it, lastly. He should seclude himself in thought, as though the spirit has somewhat rested upon him.",
                    "If he took all these measures, following this path, but did not come to any feeling, this indicates that he is not yet fully fitting and prepared for it. He therefore should continue to strengthen himself from that point forward to an even greater degree, both in his service of <i>HaShem</i>-<i>יהו״ה</i>, blessed is He, as well as in his sanctity, and then after a period of time, he should again return to seclude himself as before, until he merits that the spirit rests upon him.",

The incident that happened when Ben Azai and Ben Zoma ascended to the Pardes<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">915</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 14b – Ben Azai glimpsed and died, and Ben Zoma was harmed, in that he lost his mind.</i> attests to this.

In such cases, he must push off the spirit from upon himself, and strengthen himself even more in his service of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, until all his words are true and faithful and he has true fear of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He.",

It is, however, also possible for these levels to be attained through specific courses of action, provided that the one who does so is fitting and prepared for its attainment. It is this second manner of attainment of the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>) that will be explained in this section of the book, which is a compendium of the methods already found written in the works of earlier sages.",
                    "This section is divided into three gates. The first gate discusses the ways that one should approach and conduct himself in action. The second discusses the manners of attaining the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>). The third discusses the conditions and methods required for the attainment of the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>). It should be noted, however, that in my main book called Etz Chayim, I already have written a number of unifications (<i>Yichudim</i>) and various different wondrous paths in regard to the matter of attaining and grasping the Holy Spirit (<i>Ru’ach HaKodesh</i>). If <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, shall allow it, I shall write them with more extended explanations in a volume unto itself.",
                    "Note from the original printer: This fourth section was not copied and not included in this printed version. The reason is because it is filled with Holy Names and their permutations and many hidden secrets, that were not deemed appropriate to be printed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">917</sup><i class=\"footnote\">However, the fourth section of Shaarei Kedushah has subsequently been printed in its entirety in Sefer Ktavim Chaddashim M’Rabbeinu Chayim Vital (Jerusalem 5748 [1988]). In the first gate, he cites various teachings from earlier Kabbalists, such as the Ramban (Nachmanides), Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, Sefer Brit Menuchah, Sefer HaChassidim, Pardes Rimonim of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, Reishit Chochmah of his student, Rabbi Eliyahu Vidas, and Rabbi Yitzchak of Acco. This section primarily consists of the manner and humility in which one should conduct oneself, so as to be a fitting receptacle for the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh), to the extent that no other practices may be necessary. The second section consists of instructional guides and practices, also cited from the earlier Kabbalists. Primarily, this section includes further instructions on complete repentance, self-purification and the attainment of holiness, seclusion, the attainment of equanimity (Hishtavut), as well as some introductions to the matter and manner of the divestment of the physical, and additional introductions regarding the matters of prophecy, the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh), and the Sefirot. The third and final gate is almost entirely excerpted from the teachings of Rabbi Avraham Abulafia, of blessed memory, and are the methods of adhesion to and contemplation of the Name of HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He, primarily as it is manifest in the seventy-two names that arise from the three verses “VaYeesa-ויסע,” “VaYavo-ויבא,” and “VaYeit-ויט” (Exodus 14:19-21). However, as Rabbi Chayim Vital wrote in his introduction, “I will reveal only a hands-breadth while concealing two thousand cubits.” That is, to attain a proper understanding and approach to this section of the book, necessarily requires prerequisite knowledge of other important foundations, which were not included in this work. Nevertheless, as Rabbi Chayim Vital instructs us in his introduction, this entire work is knowledge that he received from his master and teacher, the Godly Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, the Arizal, and about this fourth section he states, “I have personally tried and tested these and have found them to be effective. However, I will only enumerate their details briefly, by way of signposts that point the way.” He indeed provides such sign-posts. For, although it is well known that the teachings of Rabbi Avraham Abulafia are mostly locked gates, it is well-known that the Arizal already pointed to the student of Rabbi Avraham Abulafia, namely, Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, as having graced us with the keys to these gates, and to the secrets of the Torah, in his famed work Shaarei Orah. Moreover, Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla himself writes of his Ginat Egoz, which preceded his Shaarei Orah, that it includes all of the critically necessary introductions and is foundational to all his other works, and to all of Torah. In it, he elucidates the true teachings of the Kabbalah that he received from his master and teacher, Rabbi Avraham Abulafia, illuminating them in a clear and simple manner, so that they may be understood by every intelligent person. In his work Otzar Eden HaGanuz, Rabbi Avraham Abulafia himself refers to his student, Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, in the greatest of terms, stating that he succeeded in that which he was taught with the greatest success, and that he attained the most wondrous success beyond even that which he was expressly taught, applying to him the words of the verse (Samuel I 16:18), “HaShem-יהו״ה was with him,” which the Talmud (Sanhedrin 93b) explains to mean that “the Halachah is like him in all areas.” Nevertheless, until our generation, this work Ginat Egoz remained hidden in manuscript form, possessed by only the righteous few. Prior to this generation, there was only one limited printing of Ginat Egoz that was brought into print by the saintly Rabbi Yishayah HaLevi Horowitz, the famed author of the Shnei Luchot HaBrit (known as the ShaLaH). Nevertheless, in our generation, Ginat Egoz has already been printed and made fully available to the public, and has also been translated and adapted into English under the title HaShem is One. It is our hope and prayer to HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He and blessed is His Name, that the publication and dissemination of these teachings will bring about the fulfillment of the prophecy (Isaiah 40:5), “The glory of HaShem-יהו\"ה will be revealed and all flesh, as one, will see that the mouth of HaShem-יהו\"ה has spoken.”</i>"
