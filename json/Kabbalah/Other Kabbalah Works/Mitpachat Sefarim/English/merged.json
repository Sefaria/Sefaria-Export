            "Behold, the essence of the book of Zohar is as holy as the essence of heaven, and its words are clear to the discerning. In the place where it speaks about the secrets of the Torah in deep riddles and hints of sublime mysteries, its language is concealed and sealed with Aleph-Ayin, and no person on the surface of the earth can dare to speculate about the words of the King of the World (who concealed them from His creatures). Only those with a holy spirit can comprehend them. However, since sinners stumbled in it, and pure stones turned into impure ones in some places, stones of plague to the obstinate sinners who pursue vanity, a rope (birth ropes shall come upon them) will be tied to a rope, false waters will be drawn from the bitter well, to give them to drink from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, so that a person will fashion from it a sharp sword to cut down the cedar trees and create a noose, as you have seen in the book Shevet Lega and in the book of Kin'ot, that all their errors are hung on a large, wicked tree (while in reality it is a support for them, a fragile reed - to crush their brains and enter through their palms and pierce them, tearing the closure of their hearts like a worm in a gourd and a ruin in Zion). That evil shepherd has returned to them, God forbid, as a mighty hunter in a foreign land, a false priest, Sabbatai Zevi, who rebelled against the whole world and his words are filled with his prophecy, the bold-faced liar, the audacious one, Sabbatai Zevi. ",
            "All their corruption is attributed to the book of Zohar, the wickedness of the hidden one, and the rectifications of Zohar. The Satan found a place to deceive them after they hardened their spirits to follow the desires of their promiscuous hearts, after foreign gods and turning away from the Lord. And when Sabbatai Zevi caused the sin through his vitalization, to extend a hand to the sinners and open the mouths of others to slander us, to hang us on the spider's web that he wove from them, a deceitful garment, an abomination to the wicked. ",
            "And even now it is printed openly for all nations, by the insane one from Frankfurt, who holds another similar book in his hand, presenting himself as a Jew and secretly telling Christians that he also adheres to the teachings of the Zohar, uttering lies with his mouth. ",
            "And likewise, this uncircumcised and impure one, Rashbi the Christian, calls out several times, woe to the eyes that see such things. All this has come upon us from the fertile root, the head and offspring of Eivshitzar the evil water, the narrow-minded one who is not worthy of harming the King of the world. He has blackened the face of the exile with his foolishness. Almost the entire faith has been lost through him, and he has made the foundations of the Torah like shadows. Those who have nurtured and multiplied and excelled in Torah, he has provoked and driven away, and he has incited and expelled all the enemies. ",
            "And so I heard from the Torah scholar, Rabbi Pinchas Yoshev Ohel (Not sure), of blessed memory, who resided in the holy city of Krakow. This man also experienced the deception of the aforementioned heretic and religious hater, Eivshitzar, may his name be erased. He even fooled him during their stay in Prague, where he wrote to him conciliatory words, attempting to appease and join the ranks of his accursed sect. In his days of studying at the Gaon Meir of Broda Yeshiva in Prague, a certain notorious apostate, the cursed Chaim Malach, emerged and arrogantly requested that Rabbi Hillel send him certain well-known wise men, who were also knowledgeable in the wisdom of Kabbalah, to argue with him regarding matters of faith and skepticism. The aforementioned esteemed head of the yeshiva, may his soul rest in peace, did the same and sent two of his select scholars, sharp and well-versed in the teachings of the Zohar and Kabbalah, namely the outstanding pious individuals such as Rabbi Yonah Landes Sofer and Rabbi Moshe Chasid, may their souls rest in peace. They traveled there and spent several days or two weeks with the aimless species of Eivshitzar, engaging in discussions and debates. However, they were seduced by his fallacies and could not respond to him with anything substantial. But they said, 'Let us fix a date and when we return to our home and tent, we will review the matters and the evidence brought to us from the Zohar to uphold his false faith.' And when they returned to their place in Prague and came to their rabbi (who sent them) with great distress and anguish of soul, he became extremely angry because they did not find an answer and they accused themselves without delay, for they did not place a muzzle on the mouth of the enemy of God. They did not know what to respond to the heretic immediately. To his delight, he could boast over them, claiming victory over the wise men of Israel, as their mouths were silenced. ",
            "So the rabbi decreed that they should immediately take a break and carefully examine the deceptive words that the wicked impostor cunningly presented to them, as a skilled manipulator, adept at capturing their attention. (And so a trustworthy person told me, who knew him and had seen him in Berlin, that even there he enticed and deceived many others with his false faith. Through cunning arguments and persuasive speeches, he made it appear to people as if it were explicitly written in the Zohar to believe in the false messiah, Shabbatai Tzvi, may his name be erased. For a brief moment, it seemed to them as if it were true.) ",
            "Indeed, the cursed abomination and his rejected faction, their tables are filled with vomit and boiling excrement, as depicted in the Zohar and the Ra'aya Mehemna in several places, with their precise and distinct colors. They are anointed with filth, their image and likeness are contemptible in a truly straightforward manner. We have shown, for those who wish to examine, all of this in the Book of Zealotry, in a clear and evident manner, not through riddles, as a great spectacle and sign. ",
            "And upon their departure from the presence of the Rabbi, they returned to examine the Book of Zohar and to investigate further if the matter is genuine. They scrutinized it with a keen eye and found that the spirit of confusion had led them astray. They did not perceive any true signs or images, other than the deceptive and misleading words spoken by the cunning serpent. The false words flowed from the mouth of the deceitful speaker, and the deceivers themselves, the compilers of the Book of Zohar, painted their tongues with colors that do not hold true, with fraudulent intentions and disgraceful fabrications. The Rabbi decreed upon them to sit in seclusion and engage solely in this examination, without interfering with others or being occupied with any other matter. They were not to move from there until they completed the task of silencing the enchanter's mouth, and they found sufficient answers to counter the doubts raised by these individuals. For the soul of the sharp-witted pious Rabbi was deeply disturbed by this matter, as no wise and discerning person was found among the impure lips of those individuals. He, may his memory be blessed, was not well-versed in the wisdom of truth. His entire focus was on sharp legal disputes. According to his decree, the aforementioned exceptional scholars refrained from all their other engagements and studies, and they sat and examined for several weeks or months. They found that all the arguments of this faction were void, empty, and filled with evil spirits. They were deceitful and hollow, like a pit dug by a wicked fool, and they stemmed from his very heart. Then the pious Rabbi rejoiced, and he renewed the decree of exile against Rabbi Moshe Chassid, ordering him to travel to the land of Italy, to proclaim this matter. It was reported to him that there, too, there were rebellious individuals from the accursed sect of the false Messiah, Shabbetai Tzvi. He instructed Rabbi Moshe Chassid to establish there a printing press for the publication of his responsa against these impious individuals of falsehood. ",
            "And so did the Chassid, Rabbi Moshe Chassid, as instructed by his master. He undertook the difficult journey and distanced himself to a distant land to fulfill the decree of his Rabbi and to create a protective barrier for the Torah. After a period of time during which he faithfully executed his mission, he returned to his Rabbi with joy. His Rabbi received him with a pleasant countenance and great happiness. These are the general details of that Torah scholar, but he did not know any specific details regarding the accusations of the accursed faction mentioned earlier. Certainly, he was unaware of the essence of Rabbi Moshe Chassid's response, its quality, and whether it was published under a specific name or anonymously. ",
            "Indeed, the accusations made by the impure ones against the holy and righteous Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai mentioned in the aforementioned books of ethical teachings are known to be words of abomination. It is known that they drew from the source of this impure contamination, the origin of the putrid feces, the offspring of the old serpent, which sinks and festers in that same territory for many years. Afterwards, they held in their hands an accursed instrument similar to it (may it be abandoned), namely, the known heretical writings that were composed and spread in Prague. He did not know seven of them, devouring the filth of Shabbatai Tzvi and the impurity of evil, a snare of a wicked man, may holiness swallow him, as a dog gobbles up a scroll (may the wicked one's downfall be swift). I have demonstrated in the holy work Shemush Gadol that they are naught and their deeds are from nothingness.",
            "Now I have said that the book of Zohar is not good; it is a book of the serpent of bronze made by R. Shimon bar Yochai. He intended through it to direct his gaze towards God. But after King Hezekiah saw that a calamity had arisen from it for future generations, and they directed their gaze towards the serpent of brass, he stood up and crushed it in order to fulfill the will of God, and they praised Him. ",
            "Even though He had mercy on the seed of the father to crush it without mercy, not even a single letter or word (anything that could possibly be preserved even under duress), because the book itself and its author are holy, it will be as it will be. Especially since it appears in practice that we hold in our hands the foundations of our holy Torah, it has wonderfully revealed profound wisdom to magnify its branches, to gloriously adorn its beauty, to nourish its infants with flowing living water from Lebanon. It shot a cornerstone, it greatly increased its splendor and built for it a fortified wall, a treasury to safeguard within it all its precious treasure. In particular, it is careful even with the minutiae of rabbinic legislation. Who is like it as a teacher? Not to mention in the body of Torah itself, it is even more stringent, surpassing all that has been transmitted to us in our holy Talmud, the desire of Israel. Therefore, I have embraced it and will not let it go. I have only spoken what was necessary. What I have said since the book of Shevet, that there are things hidden within it that were not revealed to our ancestors, and additions that are forged, and their faces are wicked. See, a man of rebellion, I have never said anything and then retracted. I have not relied on falsehood. ...",
            "But there is no doubt at all that despite all the praise of the book of Zohar, there are things that have no value that cannot escape my attention. Perhaps the scribes who copied the book secretly added supplementary parts, coated with deceptive veils. The sun of Kabbalah does not shine on them, and they are called counterfeit Zohar. And when I say they are forged, I do not mean to say that they are completely invalid to be included in the congregation of God, like a counterfeit coin in absolute falsehood. God forbid that I should cease to teach about all that is found in it that is meritorious, according to the extent of my abilities.",
            "Except for a few specific words and phrases, which I could not sufficiently explain and clarify, even after thoroughly examining them from all angles, and could not find a suitable interpretation for them in our minds and hearts, those particular parts I agreed should be removed from the book. I did not want to burden the reader with unnecessary confusion and to avoid causing stumbling blocks for those who are misled and naive because not many will understand, and a coarse person may sin. Thus, I decided to exclude them from the book, without adding any further controversy, in order to prevent any stumbling block for every erring and simple person. Not many will possess wisdom, and even the greatest can stumble. Therefore, when I come across those parts, I will mention them in their proper place, clearly distinguishing them from the holy texts. However, it is important to note that those parts are not the original words of the author himself from the beginning, although they stem from the source of Israel. However, they are later in time and inferior in quality, and it is unknown when and by whom they were compiled together. ",
            "Therefore, there is no absolute obligation for a free Jewish person (a Torah scholar who engages in the study of Torah for its sake, loyal to his God, and assured that the true secrets of the Torah are revealed to him) to assume responsibility for them [the questionable parts], decreeing that they are all absolutely genuine, pure, and trustworthy without any doubt or hesitation in the world. ",
            "Even the compilation of the Zohar itself, every essential principle was not composed by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, despite being attributed to him and named after him (as was the case with several earlier and later books for the most part). Rather, it was the students of his students' students who gathered and compiled it without a doubt, as already sensed in the accurate genealogical book (and what is mentioned there, that it was composed a year after the death of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, seems to be a printing error; it should be \"six hundred\" instead of \"a year\"). It is evident and clear to me with the help of divine inspiration (b'se'od) that it occurred three hundred years after the time of the true Tanna of the Mishnah, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai.Even the compilation of the Zohar itself, every essential principle was not composed by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, despite being attributed to him and named after him (as was the case with several earlier and later books for the most part). Rather, it was the students of his students' students who gathered and compiled it without a doubt, as already sensed in the accurate genealogical book (and what is mentioned there, that it was composed a year after the death of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, seems to be a printing error; it should be \"six hundred\" instead of \"a year\"). It is evident and clear to me with the help of divine inspiration (b'se'od) that it occurred three hundred years after the time of the true Tanna of the Mishnah, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. ",
            "I further examined the book Yuchasin and understood that his intention was not regarding the mentioned time, but only about the compilations of the Mishnah, Sifra, and Sifrei, which were completed six hundred years after the passing of Rabbi Akiva. And that is the truth, so there is no need for correction. ",
            "Nevertheless, it is as if Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai himself authored them, since these concepts originated from him initially and then were transmitted and passed down to later generations. It is fitting to be attributed to him (and similarly, many of our ancient books are named after individuals who were remotely connected to them, as evident from various sources). ",
            "Alternatively, it could be understood that Rabbi Akiva, when he requested Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai to pray for his death, relied on the great merit of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai himself, allowing him to attribute these teachings to him in order to receive them from him. And in a similar vein, we find in the Talmud that Rabbi would attribute certain teachings to a certain individual using the plural form. And in a general sense, Rabbi Meir stated in the Mishnah...",
            "Nevertheless, I say this with certainty, regardless of how it may be, that many teachings from later authors were absorbed into this compilation, even though I did not previously consider this possibility. However, I will thoroughly investigate and present my compelling evidence before all knowledgeable individuals in the field of sacred texts and literary compositions. Truly, my heart trembles within me, and I am filled with anxiety and trepidation, for the discovery of these matters raises additional concerns, as in the multitude of sins, truth is not found in the land, neither turning to the right nor relying on the left, and the truth is absent, for the appointed time has not come. Without this, many arise and confront me with their words, claiming that I am wrong, not only in my generation but also in the generations that preceded me, where their smallness is greater than mine. This is not a baseless and absolute falsehood, but the truth is as they have said, 'They became companions to the snake and its associates, for they spoke the truth and disappeared from the world.' ",
            "As an example, let it be known that I have not refrained from engaging in disputes with the book 'The Guide for the Perplexed' by the esteemed and renowned Rabbi Moses Maimonides, who is considered a great authority and luminary in ancient Israel. Despite his constant praise and glorification in many of my works, I have often fought vehemently on his behalf, using all my strength. This can be found extensively in the book 'Lehem Shamayim' (Bread of Heaven), the treatise 'Benin Beit HaBechirah' (Building the Chosen House), the 'She'iltot of Rabbi Achai Gaon' (Epistle of Inquiry and Response), the 'Iggeret Bikkur ve-Mor u-Ketzi'ah' (Epistle of First Fruits, Bitterness, and the End), 'Etz Avot' (The Tree of Ancestors), and 'Beit Tefilati' (House of My Prayer), among many others.",
            "I have already mentioned that in my humble opinion, I have expressed various disagreements with the esteemed Rabbi Moses Maimonides, and I have presented my arguments in many places. However, it should be noted that I did not oppose him everywhere but rather in places where I could defend my position. When I found the judgment to be in his favor, I did not hesitate to advocate on his behalf. Similarly, when I saw that the ruling leaned towards his opponent, the esteemed Rabbi Avraham ben David (the Raavad), I did not show any bias and refrained from supporting him. I did not refrain from presenting a fair argument on his behalf against those who opposed him, unlike some authors who always tend to follow the opinion of one great authority in every situation. Not only that, but in matters of Halacha (Jewish law) and rulings, I have taken different approaches. If I were to deem it appropriate, I would say that the revered Rabbi Moses Maimonides was indeed a great teacher who enlightened my understanding of the Halacha. Furthermore, in matters of faith and theological opinions, whenever I recognized his profound wisdom, I did not turn to the majority of scholars and prominent figures who disagreed with him. Instead, I believed that every individual in Israel has a share in the knowledge of Torah (see Ma'amad Yom Rishon in our Beit El, Drashah Rosh Hashanah). This is also expressed in the statement of Maragla D'Rav (in Beit Yisrael). ",
            "And even in matters related to the foundations of the wisdom of truth (regarding the honor of the Creator), I have stated that one can attain the truth through his own knowledge. And concerning the teachings of the Zohar, despite the disagreement of the Ramban and other holy scholars who found the words of the Zohar concealed from them, as I have already published and declared openly in the presence of the public (see Yayin BeSulam, ladder 11:2). ",
            "However, with regards to the author of the book Moreh Nevuchim (Guide for the Perplexed), I could not bring myself to show favoritism towards him. Specifically, regarding his statements about the miracles in the Torah and the Prophets, and his incorporation of external philosophies in discussing human matters, which were not hewn from the true source of Israel. Fear seized me, and my whole being trembled. Therefore, I hurriedly declared that anyone who reads the name of the Rambam (Maimonides) on the book Moreh Nevuchim is a liar, as he is not the great author of the authoritative book, as I have revealed my opinion in the ascent of the matter. ",
            "And thus, I have a dispute with other philosophers among our people, and with those who distort their tongues in the Talmud and holy Aggadot (in the book Em LaMesorah, which has not yet been published). I engaged in vigorous debate with them, and they did not know on what grounds they stumbled. The dispute is not mine, but for the sake of God. I detest divisions and love His Torah. ",
            "And this is my entire salvation and all my desire, for wickedness will not sprout from the dust of Jacob. I will not allow foreign and alien opinions to mix among us. I will speak against kings and not be ashamed. Blessed is the One who made me upright (therefore, He also called me Israel) from my mother's womb, mentioning my name Jacob, for His attribute is truth. They nicknamed me Yaaqov Eben (Jacob the son), to consult and gather workers in the Torah of truth, and whose name is truth and whose seal is truth. In Him, I trust that my love for the truth will not be conquered. I have called her Naomi, even though the people of the world called her bitter. ",
            "And already in ancient times, the early sages said, 'There is no truth on earth,' and likewise in the interpretation of our sages, there is no real substance in the world. Even so, now that the world is entrusted to the hands of fools, everything has turned upside down. Falsehood stands firm on the ground and in the heavens, like a parable: a commoner who says the truth has no place to dwell. I have suffered much bitterness because of it, to the point where my soul almost despaired in life because of the pursuers of falsehood, which is my death, while truth is my life. Therefore, until old age and gray hair, I will not abandon it, and even in my dying moments, I will hold it firmly. I will not let go of my death, for I have not known how to surrender, and behold, I have known and understood that I cannot rely on my wisdom or my intelligence. I have remained alone, while the multitude has turned away from me. Faithful ones have turned away from the sons of men, and the land is corrupted under its inhabitants. From the prophets and poets, hypocrisy has spread throughout the earth. Truth stumbled in the street, and its power cannot prevail. And in me, the words of Job are fulfilled: 'All my intimate friends abhor me, and those I love have turned against me. Even young children despise me; when I rise, they speak against me. My breath is offensive to my wife, and I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.' ",
            "And I see the face of the generation as the face of a dog, without a doubt (even though there are a few righteous individuals among them, they are nullified by their small number, and their tongues are attached to the wise, while the land is full of deception and corruption). The descendants of Canaan, who were commanded by their father not to speak the truth, have made falsehood their own, and truth is absent. It is impossible to enumerate all the characteristics of the prevailing dog-like behavior, which is spreading in these times (which are the footsteps of the Messiah, without a doubt, in the world. Woe to the generation in which it has arisen). It is not only evident and known among the obvious deceivers, but also among modest observers, and many innocent ones have fallen, even young ones who have not yet completed their novelties. Now, the fallen ones inherit and bequeath (and your sign, wise and cunning, hints at the obvious) while the wealthy residents dwell in the valleys - the prophecy of Isaiah has been fulfilled: 'They will mock them and rule over them.' The Lord is righteous (therefore, there is a good hope for Israel to quickly reach the coming of the Son of the Fallen, and the land of the Rephaim shall be healed and cleansed of these fallen ones). And the rich homeowners, with their metal riches, are like cherubs, while the poor in understanding are great fools who govern (they oppress the weak people and are foolish like them, and those who possess knowledge and understanding, the poor in speech, are silenced and paralyzed. They raise their hand to their mouth out of fear). Those who once had strength have become deaf and dumb, feeble and afflicted. For now is the time of the foxes, small foxes that ensnare. The lovers of hypocrisy willingly sacrifice their souls; they become like puppets in the hands of those who praise their deeds, even if their actions are abominable. And these testify about those who are incomparable to them in wisdom, fear of God, and great deeds. ",
            "And they proclaim everywhere that their hand has touched, to spread their voice in the camp of the blind and to bring forth a name to lifeless idols, so that people will believe in them and trust in all their words and affairs. Even if they say right is left, and unclean is clean, let no one doubt them. And against them, there are others, the wise of metals, who understand the cultivation of falsehoods in these masks. Their souls are disgusted with the deceivers; they mock them and scoff at them. But from recognizing the falseness of these idols, they completely abandon themselves and also ridicule the angels of God, mocking His words and deceiving His prophets. For it pleases them to be empty. And they have enough among the foreign-born, in the brothels, circuses, and theaters, to sweeten their secret. By reading foreign books and words of flattery, they agree and harmonize with them, thinking that they will achieve their ultimate success. There are no wise ones in their eyes like themselves, and no discerning ones comparable to them. ",
            "Between these two factions, the assembly of Israel sits, comprised entirely of its children. Its body is formed, and its essence is built upon the holy Torah, which wears a sackcloth like a widow. It is considered a harlot because her face is covered, unseen by those who approach her, and they come upon her in ways that are not fitting, as one would approach promiscuous and wayward women. They subject her to a thorough examination, treating her like a bride with her eyes uncovered. In their eyes, she appears as a disgraced maidservant to the slaves of deception. If so, why should I continue to grieve and mourn, to mingle with strangers? I have already had my fill of mockery and scorn from the arrogant and the jeering, who have caused my soul much bitterness. I have drunk and have become intoxicated, like a cup held firmly by the hands of those who give me. I have been like a drunken man who has passed wine made from the venom of serpents before wicked people who despise me and swallow me. They have rejected knowledge.",
            "And why does this argument enter? Heaven forbid that anyone should engage in a dispute in the holy Zohar, may it be praised. What benefit or advantage do I gain from this sin? Is this not a book that tells the story of a great man, who neither oppressed me, nor consumed me, nor took anything away from me? On the contrary, it is the light of my eyes in the fear of the Lord, and in it, all my wellsprings are found. If not for the insults that your slanderers, O Lord, have heaped upon me, my bones have been shattered by my own murder. My tormentors have reproached me, saying to me all day long, \"Where is your God?\" The jealousy of the Lord has done this and similar things. If, God forbid, the great Zohar is imprisoned within my bones, I cannot eat, in a place where no man is, and I see that there is no savior, and I am astonished that there is no one to come to my aid. I will speak, and it will be a breath of air for me, even if my pain does not diminish thereby. My judges, who were my soul's plunderers, will be enough for me. In all the troubles that befall me, which I have inflicted upon the house of my beloved, under the pursuit of goodness and love for my Lord in Heaven with all my heart, I have not put flesh on my arm. The One who tends to me, I will not lack His kindness. I have cast off the flesh of my arm to follow a covenant, and the remnant of Jacob and so forth, who does not hope for man or rely on mortals. I look to the Lord and know that my hope will not be in vain. In the God of truth, I have placed my trust, and truth is my desire, faithfulness is my betrothed. We are consoled by our mother's womb, and yesterday she had compassion on me, and I will not abandon her, oppressed until she delivers the oppressed one. Although I knew that the Lord is a righteous judge, who has set ambushes against me and many enemies in my old age, I did not render judgment without justice. I am not a person who denies, like a deer easy to catch, whose forehead has responded to it. Even if he brings a wall of fire, I do not despair of my pains. But enough for me is that I am not rebellious or deceitful, I have not denied the Most High. In Him, I will trust, He will strengthen His redemption, and so on. I have found a denial, for the righteous one in the place of the wicked, and under the upright, a deceitful one shall fall. He digs a pit like mud, unless this has already been a long time ago. I would be like ashes and dust. Therefore, my heart will not be reviled from my days, even if now, after the Lord has relieved me from all my enemies around me, He saves me from the mouth of the lion, from the horns of the wild oxen, from the multitude of the strong who rise against me, and from the great and mighty ones who are much stronger than me, who were like nothing and zero, my men of war. They were men of bloodshed and deceit, and so on. They were trampled like thorns in the name of the Lord, for I have consumed them. They were all like straw. ",
            "After all this, a foolish, silly, and wicked person arose upon me (from the family of Na'arim, a father, son of a boy). Sons of a worthless one, even sons of a nameless one, an empty-headed fool, all sinners and transgressors, his mouth spews forth. In the holy and wonderful book, cherished in the eyes of all who see it, a book of great usage and a valuable tool to fight against the enemies of God, a flaw was found that I did not handle well. [Note: Let Israel know that there is no rock like our God, a great artist who provided me with precise signs, profound symbols to remove the assuredly harmful effects. I, a free man, will present it at the right time, and it shall bear fruit, and so on, it will be used as a remedy, to open the mouths of the mute, even though a Chochmat Cheshbon (wise conversation) requires study, and a fool will not understand this. Are we dealing with the judges here? The opinion of fools is worthless; a wise person judges a foolish person with contempt and derision, and there is no delight between them. See the Book of Usage, and do not wonder, as the sages have said. Anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake merits many things, and the secrets of Torah are revealed to him. It is known that all his dealings in it are for the sake of the correct reading, with a soul yearning for it. In the Torah, my soul adheres with love. God has no desire for fools, and only the intelligent will understand this. Only the wicked will not understand, only the intelligent will. Note.] To draw the image of the impure shadow image, a venomous serpent with three heads, so that all those who love their souls may distance themselves from it and be cautious of its bite. The fool believes that the form of the daughter of the Cut-off One (a derogatory term) is beautiful and perfect. It is firmly ingrained in him like a dog and follows him until the day of his death. Therefore, a wicked person dared to hate him. He is similar to a dog and thinks he is his own dog, as I have stated in the book. And one fool leads many fools astray. In the second shift, the dogs bark, their teeth grind, and the tips of their tongues in their mouths will be soft. I know my living Redeemer will come forth like gold. I have joined with other companions not in ten attempts but in a hundred and more. I did not turn back from my heart all my days. Whether he is wicked or a violent oppressor, the faithful Lord knows my faithful heart, and He tests my thoughts. If a flaw clings to my palm, and my dogs agree, it is true without blemish, serving those who fear the Lord. I have served the Christian and his covenant and testimonies, desiring to justify his creatures. I am a friend to all who walk straight, judging every person favorably if possible. With the righteous, I will be kind; with the stubborn, I will wrestle and put his leg to the side. Even if those who forsake the Torah praise the wicked, one shall not say to the wicked, \"You are righteous.\" Rather, he will answer his falsehood in his presence and repay him accordingly. And so shall be all those who trust in him, those who follow after vanity, for their libations are false, and they will become like him. For God does not desire wickedness, and there shall be no future for evil. Far be it from God, the Rock of my salvation, to be ashamed. In Your loving kindness, I have trusted forever, and I will not be put to shame. God, my Savior, is aware of my heart, the faithful one who tests my lungs. If a flaw is found in my palms, my dogs will affirm it. I am true without a duplicate, serving the God-fearing. God is aware of my thoughts.",
            " I know that the Lord will execute justice for the afflicted, and He who has stood by me in all the numerous and evil troubles that have befallen me from my youth until this day. And my heavy battle that He has imposed upon me against a warrior from his youth until the break of dawn, and my righteousness shall shine like the morning sun, and it will answer for me tomorrow. And not only is He with me in the house of my war, but He stands by me against many adversaries who rise up all around me.",
            "Furthermore, I was called to come to the aid of the Lord among the mighty, to stand in the breach where Hasmoneans from Egypt and the spies of Katzar rose up in the province of Padleia to undermine our Torah. However, I accepted this obligation out of love, and the Lord was with me and strengthened my hand. And like a firm, bronze bow, my arms were stretched out to bring them back in their shame, and their arms were broken like a twisted reed. Their bow, which was raised in arrogance, was turned backward, to crush their toil in vain. I reached out my hand, and their strength was shattered. Blessed is He who showed me such things, for they have been eradicated from the land of Poland. ",
            "Despite all this, the wicked are like a restless sea, unable to find tranquility. They were expelled from their land, scattered and reduced to dust and mud in the lands of Ma'arin and Ungarin, due to the evil seed of the detested and vile wolf, Avshitzar (may his name be erased). After fleeing from here like a carcass, all his wicked sects were expelled with him. They dispersed to the lands of the warm regions, and there they gathered to him, empty and audacious men. Among them, Natan Arhelatz (may his name be erased) and Lib Shtrashaf (may his name be erased), who became prominent among the Jews. Who knows what abomination they will commit, even more so, being offspring of the infamous prostitute referred to as 'M.B.' (a derogatory term). Let us remember the abominable one from Saloniki, Sheik Tamia, who was testified against by the divine spirit, and how much money the fools scattered upon him to support his growth and find a place for his progeny. ",
            "However, let us remember that person for his goodness, the esteemed and revered Rabbi, like Meir Barbi, may his light shine, the Av Beit Din (head of the rabbinical court) of the holy congregation of P\"V. He stood in the breach and fortified it in his place. May the Lord be with him, and may his peace rise like a banner above all.",
            "And despite all this, He did not let my feet stumble. The Lord is my helper, and I shall gaze upon my enemies. Whoever wishes evil upon us, may he be cursed in the upper realms, and may he find no support in the lower realms. I will give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; His loving kindness endures forever. He has shown His great kindness to me in times of siege, preserving and sustaining me. With His abundant kindness and abundant mercy, He has brought me to old age. In Him, my heart trusts, even in old age and gray hair, He will not forsake me. May my old age not bring shame upon my youth, nor consume the vitality of my ancestors. May I and my descendants be counted among the righteous who shine like stars forever and ever. ",
            "This has been my aspiration since the day I set foot on my land, and it shall be as long as the breath of my God is in my nostrils. Therefore, I have opened my mouth; my tongue speaks with wisdom, to testify to the people and warn them to beware of the snare that the accursed men, the adherents of the false doctrine of Shabtai Tzvi, have concealed. I cry out like a trumpet until my teeth ache, to expose the wickedness of evildoers and the like. In order to protect the scattered holy flock, I will not remain silent, to restore the outcasts and bind up the injured, to guide them so they do not fall into the pit. I particularly express concern lest the days approach when there is no delight in them, and when the hand of the wicked seeks to shatter the people of God like shattered stones, so that no more will arise captives and those bound, with hands armed to overthrow the multitude of heretics who seek to destroy Israel with their false doctrines in the Valley of Destruction. For all my salvation and all my desire, for iniquity shall not sprout from the dust of Jacob, and wickedness shall be consumed like thorns. They are like raging bears and roaring lions, hanging their venomous plots in the holy book of Zohar, making from it stones of affliction and stumbling blocks, like bullets and shrapnel. ",
            "Therefore, people of understanding, listen to me, and those with discernment, heed my words. If my lips utter what is exalted, what I have spoken fervently and with integrity, let it not be a burden in our midst. We shall not be like a sponge that absorbs everything, wine and lees. We shall not hasten to accept everything written in the book of Kabbalah without investigating its origin, its roots, and the compilation that binds it, for it may be a well of corruption. Who knows what dreadful contents lie within that book, and to remove all its false signs and spurious claims, in order to produce pure holy vessels. My purpose is to fulfill the vow I have made, to bring forth into the light of the world the book of Matpachat, which I have compiled and enlarged to save children from the darkness of destruction and their souls from the abyss. Salvation belongs to the Lord. Now, regarding the essence of the true reception of wisdom, may it never be that a person from Israel doubts its truth, for it is the soul of the Torah, beyond any doubt or speculation in the world. It has been transmitted through various books, and it is undoubtedly a tradition of ancient sages, Amoraim, and Tannaim, the masters of the Talmud, as well as the illustrious Rabbi Meir Einayim, who excelled in Halacha and was a philosopher well-versed in all external wisdom. He was a skilled physician of both body and soul, the renowned Rambam (Maimonides), a faithful and divine Kabbalist, a holy and awesome man, who lived nearly six hundred years ago. His acceptance of Kabbalah and his commentary on the Torah are well-known and renowned throughout the world....",
            "(Although the Rambam (Maimonides) may not have merited Kabbalah, and if his ear caught a glimpse of it, he held onto heresy, as can be seen in his book \"Guide for the Perplexed,\" if it is indeed his book.)",
            "(And his contemporary, the Gaon R. Saadia Gaon, like him, did not grasp it; his hand reached out to it, but he pushed it away with both hands, as can be seen in his book \"The Book of Beliefs and Opinions.\" It is also evident in his commentary on the book of Daniel, which is printed and known by his name, but it is not his work. The same happened with the commentary on the Book of Yetzirah, known as the false commentary of R. Saadia Gaon, where he mentions that Avraham formed a man before the giving of the Torah, which contradicts the teachings of the ancient sages. And who does not know that Saadia Gaon had no share or inheritance in the wisdom of Kabbalah, especially in its practical aspect? I wish he had not denied it. Therefore, the story mentioned above is certainly baseless. However, the honor of the author of that commentary is acknowledged, for he was undoubtedly a God-fearing Ashkenazi who hastened to believe in an unfounded matter without clear investigation and knowledge, considering it as an honor to the Torah.)",
            "And it is unnecessary to mention the Rabbi Avraham ben David (Raavad), the early commentator of the book Yatzira, and among our early Ashkenazi sages, there is the Chassid (pious individual) who authored the book Rochach (Rokeach). And among the sages of Spain after the Ramban (Nachmanides), there is the Rashba (Rabbi Shlomo ben Aderet) and all his students who upheld it. It is certainly the wisdom of the Divine that the Talmudic sages hinted at in the Mishnah and Gemara, and it is mentioned in the name of Ma'aseh Merkavah and Ma'aseh Bereishit (Work of the Chariot and Work of Creation).",
            "And the entire written and oral Torah hints and points to it with the finger of God, for there is a hidden charm in the Torah for the righteous, through which they behold wonders from our divine Torah. Without it, there is no true wisdom, and it is the fruit of the Tree of Life. Its taste is life, and those who merit it enjoy eternal life, in the light of the countenance of the living King. And on it, they inquire on the Day of Judgment, as our sages said, 'You have looked into the chariot [Furthermore, the fear of God is its treasure, etc.].'",
            "And it requires sanctity, separations, purity, and a pure heart in the pursuit of truth, the pursuit of justice and peace, the pursuit of knowledge with love of God and fear of Him, and the grasp of wisdom and true understanding that are hidden in order to merit it. Anything other than this is dangerous, as the cause of harm is based on unacceptable free speculation, as the Ramban stated in the introduction to his commentary on the Torah, and it is detrimental to a corrupted soul. It is a snare. All of this is already known in the books of the Kabbalists. Whoever wishes to know on what their foundation is based should study them and find sufficient certainty. Therefore, I will not dwell on this, as assisting without strength, etc., is futile.",
            "Even the book of Zohar is undoubtedly a crown among the Kabbalistic works in the world, as also testified by the holy Ari, may his memory be a blessing, who was a man of divine sanctity and the holy spirit rested upon him. All his wisdom was built upon it, the sublime and awe-inspiring wisdom. Heaven forbid to doubt his words.",
            "However, in the printed edition of this book, there are elements of barley and straw mixed in it, and hidden homiletical statements that appear troubling and disturbing to anyone who is not engaged in the composition. Similarly, several statements are included within the book of Zohar itself, and they are in corrupted Aramaic language, as in the portion of Vayechi, which even the publisher criticized, sensing a distortion of the author's language, attempting to imitate the Zohar like an ape in human form, and his language is extremely distorted, resembling the chirping of a mockingbird. But besides these, even in the core parts of the book, its language is clean and pure. I have strong evidence that in recent times it fell under the control of others, even if it may not have reached the highest level, as I will explain with the help of God.",
            "[Note: And he engages in Torah for its own sake, in order to preserve and fulfill it, and he is meticulous in observing even the minor details of the commandments, the fences of our Sages, and their decrees. In general, the Torah is only revealed to a person of good and upright character, as it is written, \"The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him\" (Psalm 25:14), especially one with a pure and clean heart, who despises any form of dishonest gain, has complete trust in God, and does not rely on any human being to speak the truth in his heart. His spirit is not haughty; he walks in simplicity, hates injustice, and does not associate with the wicked. He loves righteousness and honors those who fear God. He is compassionate, humble, generous, patient, modest, and careful of his actions. He is mindful of the future, and even concerns himself with repairing the faults of others. He is desirable and beloved below and above, he fears God in all matters, as it is written, \"The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him\" (Psalm 25:14). He is not disdainful of God's discipline, but rather acknowledges Him in every measure and thanks Him for every attribute and quality that He bestows upon him. He fulfills his obligations with enthusiasm, rejoices in the remembrance of God and His love, distances himself from anger, grief, and sorrow, and does not complain except for his own sins, the destruction of the Temple, and the length of the exile. He refrains from idle talk and frivolous matters. He avoids mocking and jesting, and his heart is strong to withstand the pressures of the corrupt. He contemplates the Torah day and night, never ceasing to study its words. He exerts himself to uncover its hidden depths, both revealed and concealed, in matters of Jewish law and aggadah. He fills his cup with the words of the legal authorities, in order to discern and comprehend the laws and statutes of God, and to weigh arguments with true and upright judgment. Through this, he comes to know the observance of the commandments and the laws in the best and most complete way, knowing how to delve into the profound and extensive wisdom of the Talmud, with knowledge and understanding, not in order to be ensnared by falsehoods, twisted paths, or deceptions, but to gain a deep understanding of the Midrashim, and to speak in clear and desirable language. He has a balanced and logical mind, safeguarding himself even from the slightest error, even in a single word, and certainly in speech and pronunciation. Rather, his actions are blameless, for he is the embodiment of a righteous person.]  ",
            "[Note: In addition to all of the above, one should not be naive or ignorant of human wisdom. They should recognize the nature of this lowly world and its ways, the changes in time, generations, and local customs, as well as the circumstances, systems, and opinions of people from past and present, their character in every country and among every people. They should be a person of good intellect, investigating and knowing what is good and evil, discerning between truth and falsehood, not to mention the differences between left and right, as it is written, \"He gives wisdom to the wise.\" However, these pursuits are only the fringes of the path for those who wish to enter the inner chambers of the King and become among His trusted confidants, to behold the hidden treasures of the Divine.] In this regard, one should also be experienced in the battle against their own evil inclination in order to attain the treasure. Therefore, it is necessary to be skilled in the struggle against the evil inclination in order to acquire the treasure. [Note: End of the note.]"

            "This author will explain that there is reason to suspect that Rabbi Moshe De Leon sent his hand onto the text of the Zohar that came into his possession and if he did not write the entirety of the text [from scratch] he at least wrote part of it. At the very least, there is no way to escape the conclusion that Raya Meheimana and the Tikkunei Zohar are certainly, without any doubt or uncertainty whatsoever the work of the hands of a Sefardic Kabalist, and he hanged [his words] on a great tree in accordance with the advice of Rabbi Akiva to Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai. This is attested through many strong proofs that are \"as strong as a molten mirror\" which are unanswerable.",

            "Is it not seen from the quotations above that the Zohar explains the verse [in Ezekiel 1:27] with reference to a Synagogue called an Esnoga and the appearance of shining with reference to a Synagogue called an Esnoga.",
            "You should wonder to yourself where the author of the Zohar got the idea that a Synagogue is called Esnoga. This name is not found in the Bible, the targums, the two talmuds (The Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds), nor in the many Midrashim of the Talmudic Sages that are in our hands. This name is, however, found in Spanish [i.e Ladino] where they do call a Synagogue Esnoga. (If you wonder how I know this given that I don't know Spanish, you hear the Sefardim in our area using this name for a house of prayer. You can also look at the responsa of the AMaH of blessed memory (Responsum 38) where they sent a question in the foreign language of Ladino which is translated to Hebrew and we see the [Ladino] word Esnoga under the [Hebrew word for] Synagogue.)  He quotes this word on 2 occassions to explain the verses. It is not believable that these are the words of the Talmudic Sages who wrote the Talmud, even Ravina and Rav Ashi, or the Saforaim or even the Geonim in Babylon because none of them knew Ladino (let alone Rashbi the Tana whom only an extreme simpleton could attribute this too.) Rather [you could suggest] the author used an idea well-known to people  and used to explain the mystical meaning of the text, so too with Ezekiel's chariot vision but this seems very far-fetched and foreign to me. Rather, the truth appears to be that this and everything like it found in this book is an addition by a Sefardi Kabalist"
