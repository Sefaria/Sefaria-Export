                "<big><strong>(The matter of the Sefirot, the conducts and their names)</strong></big><br>1. [Our sages, of blessed memory, stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pirkei D’Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 3; See Ginat Egoz of Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, translated as HaShem Is One, Vol. 1, The Gate of Intrinsic Being (<i>Shaar HaHavayah</i>).</i> “Before the creation of the world there was Him and His Name alone.” This Name <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה is the name of His Essential Self (<i>Atzmut</i>) and is called <i>Shem HaEtzem-</i>the Name of the Essential Self. Therefore, just as He is unknowable to any being other than Himself, so is His Essential Name unknowable.] Therefore, since <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, blessed is He, is beyond the limitations of space and time or any other limitations, Kabbalah refers to Him as <i>Ein Sof</i> – The Unlimited One, blessed is He. As He is Unlimited and Boundless, so is the power of His will.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Part 8, #21 and #22.</i>",
                "2. Since <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה is Unlimited, it therefore is impossible for a limited human being to know Him through His own limited intellect, and thus, all his musings will be no more than false imaginations. It therefore is prohibited to contemplate <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה Essential Self. This matter is widely known. Therefore, everything that will be related here about <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, only pertains to His will and providence, as manifest in His actions. This general rule applies to all Kabbalah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See GRA, Likkutim, toward the end of Sifra D’Tzniutah.</i> as stated by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in his book Adir Bamarom,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Adir BaMarom, by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato, pg. 59a.</i> “It is self-evident that any expression regarding the Emanator, Blessed is He, only refers to His actions, rather than His Essential Self.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See beginning of Choker U’Mekubal, by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto.</i>",
                "3. Now, there are ten <i>Sefirot</i> by which <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, blessed is He, creates and conducts the worlds.<br>They Are:<br>1. <i>Keter</i> – Crown,<br>2. <i>Chochmah</i> – Wisdom,<br>3. <i>Binah</i> – Understanding,<br>4. <i>Chessed</i> – Kindness,<br>5. <i>Gevurah</i> – Might,<br>6. <i>Tiferet</i> – Beauty,<br>7. <i>Netzach</i> – Victory,<br>8. <i>Hod</i> – Majesty,<br>9. <i>Yesod</i> – Foundation,<br>10. <i>Malchut</i> – Kingdom.",
                "4. The <i>Sefirot</i> are those Divine faculties through which <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, blessed is He, creates and conduct the worlds.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Klach Pitchei Chochmah, by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, Part 8:6. Also see Likkutei HaGRA. Also see toward the beginning of Choker U’Mekubal and toward the beginning of his work Kinat HaShem Tzva’ot.</i>",
                "5. <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה governs the world with three general modes of conduct; Pure Kindness – <i>Chessed</i>, Pure Judgment – <i>Din</i>, and the median conduct of Mercy – <i>Rachamim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sefer Yetzirah, Ch. 3.</i>",
                "6. <i>Keter</i> influences great and unbounded kindness and mercy without discerning the merit of the recipient. This is because <i>Keter</i> represents <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה ultimate intention in creation, that is, to benefit all, as the Talmud states<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 7a; Also see GRA there.</i> on the verse, “I will be gracious to whomever I will be gracious,” – even to the unworthy.",
                "7. <i>Chochmah</i> too, is free of Judgment, influencing the world with great kindness including the unworthy, but, not to the same extent of <i>Keter</i>.<br>The quality of <i>Binah</i> is kindness as well, but to a lesser degree. This is because judgments begin to arise in <i>Binah</i>, [as mentioned in the blessing: “Who gives the rooster the understanding (<i>Binah</i>) to discern (Judgment) between day and night,”] – For sometimes, in order to prevent anarchy, <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה exercises judgment upon the world, so that evil, though a necessary component in creation for the purpose of choice, will not be left unchecked. This judgment, in truth, is a kindness to the world. Moreover, kindness may be the motivating factor of severity, as scripture states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 3:12.</i> “For whom <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה loves, He corrects,” and,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:5.</i> “As a man chastens his son, so does <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה your God chasten you.”",
                "8. <i>Keter</i>, <i>Chochmah</i>, and <i>Binah</i> are called the first or upper three <i>Sefirot</i>. When any of these are revealed, it is a time of great mercy and goodwill toward the world. They reflect <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה ultimate intention in the world, unobstructed by the deeds of man.",
                "9. <i>Chesed</i> is pure kindness, though only to the meritorious, as is the reward of the righteous in <i>Gan Eden.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Paradise</i> <i>Gevurah</i> is pure judgment and retribution to the guilty, as is the punishment of the wicked in <i>Gehenom.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Purgatory</i> <i>Tiferet</i> is the median conduct of mercy, between <i>Chesed</i> and <i>Gevurah</i>, but inclines more toward kindness than judgment.",
                "10. <i>Netzach</i> is kindness tempered with judgment; for example, sometimes the righteous suffer in this world for their few errors, to ultimately be rewarded in the coming world – the seemingly negative being ultimately positive.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Kiddushin 39b, Yoma 86a, Derech HaShem of Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, 2:23</i>",
                "11. <i>Hod</i> is judgment tempered with kindness; for example, sometimes the wicked prosper in this world for their few virtues, to ultimately be destroyed in the coming world, as scripture states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 7:10; Talmud Bavli, Yoma 86, Kiddushin 49-50</i> “He pays his enemy up front to destroy him,” – the seemingly positive being ultimately negative. <i>Yesod</i> is the median conduct between <i>Netzach</i> and <i>Hod</i>, tempered by both, but inclining more toward judgment than kindness.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Likkutei HaGRA, Sifra D’Tzniuta – Sod HaTzimtzum pg. 38-39</i> The world is generally conducted through this faculty.",
                "12. The six <i>Sefirot</i> (<i>Chesed</i>, <i>Gevurah</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzach</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i>) are collectively called the “System of Justice” in that they are responsive to human deeds, for even <i>Chesed</i>, which is pure kindness, applies only to the meritorious.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Klach Pitchey Chochmah, Petach 92</i>",
                "13. <i>Keter</i> is called <i>Arich Anpin</i> – “Patient,” because it represents unqualified mercy, which will only be fully realized in the coming world. (This gives the righteous the opportunity to acquire greater merit, and the wicked the chance to repent.)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Vali, Bava Kama 50b</i> The six [above mentioned] <i>Sefirot</i> are called <i>Zeir Anpin</i> – “Short Tempered,” because they represent the qualified system of justice by which the world is presently being conducted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Klach Pitchey Chochmah 92-95</i>",
                "14. <i>Malchut</i> is the medium for Divine Providence through which the kingdom of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה and His Indwelling Presence – the <i>Shechinah, </i>will be realized and accepted by all. This <i>Sefirah</i> has a dual function; it is a conduit that accepts man’s good deeds and prayers, and responds by transmitting Divine influence upon them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Commentary of the GRA on Raaya Mehemna, end of Part One of Zohar, second edition, starting with the word <i>Vayachalom</i>-ויחלם. Also see Sefer Kinat HaShem Tzvaot of the Ramchal, Part One, which explains the reason for ten sefirot.</i>",
                "15. The term <i>Sefirot-</i>ספירות means numbers – <i>Mispar -</i>מספר<i>.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Commentary of the GRA in Yahel Ohr concerning Zohar Bereishit, Page 15a.</i> The matter of sefirot can therefore be applied to many matters. Everything that exists can be divided into ten <i>Sefirot</i>.",
                "16. Scripture states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kings I 22:19 (See Rashi there)</i> “All the hosts of heaven stand by Him to His right and to His left.” The sages asked, “And are there right and left above? Rather, right is for virtue and left is for guilt.” Therefore, a <i>Sefirah</i> that influences kindness to the worthy is considered to be “right” and one which influences judgment upon the guilty is considered to be “left.”",
                "17. A schematic diagram of the <i>Sefirot</i> conveying this matter would therefore appear thus: <i>Keter</i> in the top center position, since it is the root of all. Under it, <i>Chochmah</i> to the right and <i>Binah</i> to the left, since in <i>Binah</i> discernments begin to arise. Under them, <i>Chesed</i> to the Right and <i>Gevurah</i> to the left, with the median conduct of <i>Tiferet</i> centered below. Below them, <i>Netzach</i> to the right and <i>Hod</i> to the left, with the median conduct of <i>Yesod</i> centered below. Under <i>Yesod</i>, in the center, is <i>Malchut</i> which receives from them all.",
                "18. This schematic is called the Ten Upright <i>Sefirot</i> – <i>Esser Sefirot D'Yosher.</i>",
                "19. There is also a schematic diagram of concentric circles, in which <i>Keter</i> encompasses <i>Chochmah</i>, which in turn encompasses <i>Binah</i>, etc., with <i>Malchut</i> at its center. This diagram is called the Ten <i>Sefirot</i> of Circles – <i>Esser Sefirot D'Iggulim</i>. It conveys principles in the development of the worlds, one from the other, and indicates that the more essential the conduct, the more all-encompassing it is.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 5:2-4</i> But, when the subject is the Divine system of conduct, the quality of its various modes and their interrelationships, the scheme of the ten upright <i>Sefirot</i> is used.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Klach Pitchey Chochmah 13</i> (The GR\"A states that the circular <i>Sefirot</i> indicate general providence, whereas the upright <i>Sefirot</i>, indicate individual providence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Likutei HaGRA, Sifra D’Tzniuta, Mesora edition, Jerusalem 5746, Sod HaTzimtzum pg. 38-39.</i>)",
                "20. <i>Malchut</i> is more severe than the six <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which represent the system of justice, for since <i>Malchut</i> is called “Righteous Judgment,” it is more exacting. Only at times, through the merit of mankind, does <i>Malchut</i> join <i>Chesed</i> (Kindness) resulting in Rachamim (Mercy).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Zohar, Idra Zutra, HaAzinu 291b, 292a; Also see Chapter 7:4-7:6 of this book.</i>",
                "21. A general conduct which is an expression of judgment, such as <i>Malchut</i>, is considered to be female. This is one reason that <i>Malchut</i> is often called <i>Nukvah</i> (Female).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 11:15; See Rashi there.</i>",
                "22. <i>Binah</i> is somewhat severe relative to <i>Chochmah</i>, since discernments begin to arise in it. Therefore, it too, is considered to be female. Accordingly, in Kabbalistic terminology, when the judgmental aspect of a particular <i>Sefirah</i> is mentioned, the feminine gender is used. For example, “<i>Arich Anpin</i> and his Female,” refers to <i>Keter</i>, which is the quality of absolute mercy, and the potential judgment dormant in it.<br><i>Gevurah</i> and <i>Hod</i>, though they are expressions of judgment, are not generally considered to be female. This is because they are integral components in the reward and punishment of the System of Justice – <i>Zeir Anpin</i>, which is masculine, and do not function independently of it.",
                "23. The <i>Sefirot</i> have both revealed and concealed aspects. The revealed is considered to be external, and the concealed is considered to be internal. An example of a concealed aspect is a kindness done in secrecy, in which the kindness or goodness is not recognized, as stated in Proverbs:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 27:5</i> “Good is a revealed rebuke coming from a hidden love,” and as stated in Talmud,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Niddah 31a</i> “The recipient of a miracle does not recognize it as such.”",
                "24. Sometimes instead of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Daat</i> is enumerated amongst the <i>Sefirot.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beginning of Sefer Mishnat Chassidim; Also see the GRA on Sefer Yetzirah, Part 1, Mishnah 1, Ofan 3.</i> The GR\"A explained that the inclusion of <i>Keter</i> reflects the inner aspect, while the inclusion of <i>Daat</i>, reflects the external aspect.",
                "25. This is because the quality of <i>Keter</i> – “Great Mercy,” is not presently revealed. It will only be fully realized in the coming world. This is indicated by the Divine name “I will be-<i>Ehe”yeh-</i>אהי\"ה,” in the future tense, meaning, “I am destined to be” – after the six thousandth year of Creation. Since the conduct toward the world is preparatory to <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה ultimate intent of benefiting all, <i>Keter</i>, though concealed, is its underlying and motivating force, as stated in the Talmud,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Brachot 60b</i> “Everything that the Merciful One does is for the good.”<br>For this reason, <i>Keter</i> is only counted in respect to the hidden inner aspect, but regarding the external aspect, <i>Daat</i> is counted instead, since it represents the miniscule revelation of <i>Keter</i> in this world, on a lesser level. It is, therefore, centered under <i>Chochmah</i> (which is free of Judgment) and <i>Binah</i> (in which discernments begin to arise) being a median conduct between them.",
                "26. All that is revealed and known to us of <i>Keter</i> is that this world is preparatory to its revelation in the coming world. Accordingly, <i>Keter</i> is the root of all present conducts, since it was <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה original intent to reveal <i>Keter</i> through them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Klach Pitchay Chochmah, Chapter 8, 92-93</i> – “The last deed being first in thought.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lecha Dodi, Shabbat evening liturgy, written by Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz.</i>",
                "27. This explains the above statement that <i>Keter</i> is counted regarding the inner aspect, but regarding the external aspect, <i>Daat</i> is counted instead, and <i>Keter</i> is only considered to be the root. <i>Keter</i> is therefore called <i>Ein</i> – Nothingness and <i>Raysha D'Ein </i>- The Primal Nothingness, because we comprehend almost nothing of it. Accordingly, the GR\"A<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Commenting on beginning of Sifra D’Tznuta page 1.</i> states that, “revelation begins with <i>Chochmah</i>.” The order of the <i>Sefirot</i> would then be: <i>Chochmah</i>, <i>Binah</i>, <i>Daat</i>, <i>Chesed</i>, etc.",
                "28. Thus, since the revealed aspect begins with <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i>, they are called Father and Mother – <i>Abba V'Imma,</i> for since discernments begin to arise in <i>Binah</i>, it is considered to be female.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 5:3-4</i>",
                "29. The <i>Sefirot</i> can therefore be categorized into five general modes of conduct (<i>Partzufim</i>): <i>Arich Anpin </i>- Patient, for <i>Keter</i>,<br><i>Abba</i> – Father, for <i>Chochmah</i>,<br><i>Imma</i> – Mother, for <i>Binah</i>,<br><i>Zeir Anpin </i>- Short Tempered, for the six <i>Sefirot Chesed</i>, <i>Gevurah</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzach</i>, <i>Hod</i>, and <i>Yesod</i> (which collectively constitute the System of Justice) and,<br><i>Nukvah</i> – The Female, for <i>Malchut</i>.",
                "30. Sometimes the ten <i>Sefirot</i> are categorized as the five kindnesses and the five severities. The five kindnesses are:<br><i>Keter</i>,<br><i>Chochmah</i>,<br><i>Chesed</i>,<br><i>Tiferet</i>, (since it inclines toward kindness),<br>and, <i>Netzach</i>.<br>The five severities are:<br><i>Binah</i>,<br><i>Gevurah</i>,<br><i>Hod</i>,<br><i>Yesod</i> (since it inclines toward judgment),<br>and <i>Malchut</i>.",
                "31. The six <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Zeir Anpin</i> are called <i>Vav Kitzvot</i> (The Six Extremities), corresponding to the six directions in the world:<br><i>Chesed</i> – corresponds to the south,<br><i>Gevurah</i> – to the north,<br><i>Tiferet</i> – to the east,<br><i>Netzach</i> – to up,<br><i>Hod</i> – to down,<br>and <i>Yesod</i> – to the west.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 1, Mishnah 5 and 13. See GRA there.</i>",
                "32. <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה formed all the limbs and organs of man corresponding to the supernal conducts. Each of man’s limbs hints at a Divine conduct. Since there are ten general <i>Sefirot</i>, so too, in man, there are ten general corresponding parts:<br>The Head – corresponds to the first three <i>Sefirot</i>:<br>The Skull and Membrane – to <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Right Hemisphere of the Brain – to <i>Chochmah</i>,<br>The Left Hemisphere of the Brain – to <i>Binah</i>,<br>(The Cerebellum – to <i>Daat</i>)<br>The Right Arm and Hand – to <i>Chesed</i>,<br>The Left Arm and Hand – to <i>Gevurah</i>,<br>The Torso – to <i>Tiferet</i>,<br>The Right Leg and Foot, to <i>Netzach</i>,<br>The Left Leg and Foot, to <i>Hod</i>,<br>The Male Organ (which carries the sign of the Holy Covenant – <i>Brit Kodesh</i>) – To <i>Yesod</i><br>and the Glans (<i>Ateret Habrit</i>) – to <i>Malchut</i>.",
                "33. Kabbalah sometimes refers to the <i>Sefirot</i> by the names of their corresponding limbs in man. For example, <i>Keter</i> is called <i>Gulgalta – </i>Skull; <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah</i> are called <i>Mochin </i>- The Brains; <i>Chesed</i> is called The Right Arm, etc. Obviously, these names are allegorical. It should not, heaven forbid, enter one’s mind that any image or form exists, for this would certainly be an absolute error, constituting a complete denial of the truth of Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sefer Etz Chayim Chaddashim, Sefer HaIlan HaGadol, Sefer Mikdash Melech, and Sefer Shaarei Kedusha of Rabbi Chaim Vital, translated as Gates of Holiness, and the second introduction to Tikkunei Zohar.</i>"

                "<big><strong>(The matter of the six hundred and thirteen (613) limbs and organs of man and their spiritual counterparts, as well as the subject of the <i>Partzufim.</i>)</strong></big><br>34. Above, the limbs of man and their spiritual counterparts were categorized in a general way. More specifically, the conducts are further subdivided. Every general <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Keter</i> contains ten <i>Sefirot</i>, <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Binah</i> of <i>Keter</i>, etc., until <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Keter</i>. So, also the general <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> contains ten <i>Sefirot</i>: <i>Keter</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>, <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>, etc. This principle applies to all the <i>Sefirot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Every <i>sefirah</i> contains something of all the other <i>sefirot</i> in it. <i>Keter</i> contains everything in a state of potentiality, since it is the source of all. Since <i>Malchut</i> is the final result of all, it receives from all. All the intermediate levels between these two extremities both receive from the levels above and contain the potentiality for the levels subsequent to them. This may be compared to the generations. Our father Avraham was the first Jew and thus bore the potential for every subsequent Jew throughout the generations. The Jews of our generation, being the final result, carry all the influence of our ancestry, all the way back through the generations to Avraham. We also have something of every other Jew of our generation within us. This is because we are all related and intertwined with each other, as stated (Sifra Bechukotai 7:5), “All Israel are intertwined with each other.”</i>",
                "35. Each particular <i>Sefirah</i> contains ten further subdivisions: <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i> contains <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>, <i>Binah</i> of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>, etc., until <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>. All the particular <i>Sefirot</i> are subdivided in this manner.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Kinat HaShem Tzvaot pg. 84 Friedlander edition 5740; Also see Etz Chayim, Heichal One, Heichal Adam Kadmon, Droosh Igoolim V’Yosher pg. 12a.</i>",
                "36. Man's limbs and organs too, are subdivided corresponding to the subdivisions of their spiritual counterparts.",
                "37. The Skull and its Membrane, which correspond to <i>Keter</i>, has ten components corresponding to the ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Keter</i>. Etz Chaim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Etz Chaim, Shaar Arich Anpin, Chapter 6, pg. 63b – 64b.</i> categorizes them as follows:<br>The Skull – corresponds to <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Right Ear – to <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Left Ear – to <i>Binah</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>(The Forehead – to <i>Daat</i> of <i>Keter</i>),<br>The Right Eye – to <i>Chesed</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Left Eye – to <i>Gevurah</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Nose – to <i>Tiferet</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Upper Lip – to <i>Netzach</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Lower Lip – to <i>Hod</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Tongue – to <i>Yesod</i> of <i>Keter</i>,<br>The Mouth – to <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Keter</i>.<br>Sefer Yetzirah states that there are seven components in the head. These are called the Seven Gates or Orifices. According to the GR\"A,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sefer Yetzirah Part 4, See GRA there.</i> they correspond to these seven sefirot:<br>The Right Eye – to <i>Chesed</i>,<br>The Left Eye – to <i>Netzach</i>,<br>The Right Ear – to <i>Gevurah</i>,<br>The Left Ear – to <i>Hod</i>,<br>The Right Nostril – to <i>Tiferet</i>,<br>The Left Nostril – to <i>Yesod</i>,<br>and The Mouth – to <i>Malchut</i>.",
                "38. Kabbalah sometimes refers to the subdivisions of <i>Keter</i> by the names of their corresponding parts in the head. For example: <i>Peh</i> – Mouth, refers to <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Keter</i>. This explains why <i>Malchut</i> is sometimes called <i>Peh</i> – Mouth, and sometimes <i>Atara -</i> Glans. The term <i>Peh </i>- Mouth, refers to the particular <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Keter</i>, whereas <i>Atara </i>- Glans, refers to the general <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Malchut</i>. This principle applies to all the general and particular <i>Sefirot</i>.",
                "39. Each <i>Sefirah</i> contains the three general modes of conduct: Pure Kindness, Pure Judgment, and the median conduct of Mercy. For example: the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Chesed</i> contains Kindness of <i>Chesed</i>, Judgment of <i>Chesed</i>, and Mercy of <i>Chesed</i>. The <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Gevurah</i> contains Kindness of <i>Gevurah</i>, Judgment of <i>Gevurah</i>, and Mercy of <i>Gevurah</i>. This principle applies to all the <i>Sefirot</i>.",
                "40.

This is to avoid the confusion of <i>A”V</i>-ע\"ב with <i>NA”V-</i>נ\"ב.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Midrash Pley’ah states, “Why are three levels straight-forward and one reversed? Because the signet of the Holy One, blessed be He, is אמת-Truth. The holy MaHaRaSH of Astropolia explains that this Midrash refers to the four expansions of the name <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה. The first three are written in their proper order with the greater value preceding the lesser value, as follows: <i>AV</i>-ע\"ב is 70 & 2 = 72, SAG (ס\"ג) is 60 & 3 = 63, <i>MAH</i>-מ\"ה is 40 & 5 = 45. Accordingly, the proper form of the expansion of the Divine name of 52 would seem to be <i>NAV</i>-נ\"ב which is 50 & 2 = 52. However, we find that this name is reversed to read <i>BAN-</i>ב\"ן which is 2 & 50 = 52. This is because the signet of the Holy One, blessed be He, is Truth-<i>Emet</i>-אמת. The numerical value of the word Truth-<i>Emet</i>-אמת is 441 (א=1 מ=40 ת=400 =441). Its “Reduced Gematria,” which is the value of the letters, minus the zeros, is 9, as follows: א=1 מ=4 ת=4 is 9. So too, the “Reduced Gematria” of these Divine names equals 9 as follows: <i>AV-</i>ע\"ב is 7 & 2 = 9, <i>SAG</i>-ס\"ג is 6 & 3 = 9, <i>MAH</i>-מ\"ה is 4 & 5 = 9. Now, if the name of 52 would be spelled in its (seemingly) proper order, its “Reduced Gematria” would only be 7, as follows: <i>NAV</i>-נ\"ב is 5 & 2 = 7. However, since the numerical value of a “Final Nun” (ן) is 700, when the letters of this Divine name are reversed, its “Reduced Gematria” also equals 9, as follows: <i>BAN-</i> ב\"ן is 2 & 7 = 9, which is also the “Reduced Gematria” of the word Truth-<i>Emet</i>-אמת. It is for this reason that the letters of this name are reversed.<br>The GRA once asked Rabbi Kalonimus Kalman of Tzus, “Since the correct grammatical form of the Divine name of 52 would be <i>NAV-</i>נ\"ב, with the number of greater value preceding the number of lesser value, in which the letter Nun (נ) only equals 5 in “Reduced Gematria,” then of what value is it to forcibly reverse the form in order to change the numerical value?” Rabbi Kalonimus responded, “Actually, in its deeper sense, the Nun (נ) of this Divine name is a “Final Nun” (ן) in essence, rather than a simple Nun (נ). As known, the name of 52 (ב\"ן) has double the numerical value of the name <i>HaShem</i>. <i>HaShem</i>=26x2=52. If we count up the number 26 adding all the numbers together, we arrive at the sum total of 351, as follows: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15+16+17+18+19+20+21+22+23+24+25+26=351. <br>Now, the Divine name of 52 is twice 26. Double 351 equals 702. (2x351=702) which is the numerical value of the name of 52, <i>BAN</i>-ב\"ן when it is spelled with a final Nun (ן) as follows: ב=2 ן=700 is 702. Therefore, its value in “Reduced Gematria” is 2+7=9, which is the value of the word Truth-<i>Emet</i>-אמת in “Reduced Gematria.” From this we see that, actually, the appropriate form of the Divine name of 52 is <i>BAN</i>-ב\"ן rather than <i>NAV-</i>נ\"ב.

The name <i>HaShem</i> always indicates mercy. So too, the letter Alef (א) indicated mercy since it is composed of two letters Yud (י) and a Vav (ו). Two Yuds-י and a Vav-ו have the numerical value of 26 which equals the numerical value of the name <i>HaShem-</i>יהו״ה.</i>",

                "82. There is another aspect of the Divine names called <i>Ribuah</i>-squaring, whereby after each consecutive letter the name reverts to its beginning, for example the square of יהו\"ה is:<br>י<br>י\"ה<br>י\"ה\"ו<br>י\"ה\"ו\"ה<br>The square of Shaddai-שד\"י is;<br>ש<br>שד<br>שד\"י<br>This principle applies to all the Divine names and indicates judgment. A squared name reflects the aspect of the “back” (<i>Achorayim-</i>אחוריים).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Tanya, Part 2, Shaar HaYichud VeHaEmunah, Chapter 1 on the 231 gates backwards and forwards.</i>",
                "83. The principle of <i>Ribuah</i>-squaring also applies to all the extended names, for example; the squared name of Av-ע״ב-72 is;<br>יו\"ד<br>יו\"ד-ה\"י<br>יו\"ד-ה\"י-וי\"ו<br>יו\"ד-ה\"י-וי\"ו-ה\"י<br>84. The letters of the Divine names may also be arranged in all their possible combinations. This is called <i>Tziruf</i>-Combinations (צירוף). To illustrate, the name יה״ו has six possible combinations corresponding to the six <i>Sefirot</i>, as follows:<br>Chesed corresponds to יו״ה<br>Gevurah to הו״י<br>Tiferet to וי״ה<br>Netzach to יה״ו<br>Hod to הי״ו<br>and Yesod to וה״י<br>This order follows the principle that the more essential quality takes precedence in the order of the letters. <i>Chesed</i> and <i>Netzach</i>, which are in the right column, begin with <i>Yod-</i>י, representing kindness. <i>Gevurah</i> and <i>Hod</i>, which are in the left column, begin with <i>Hey</i>-ה, representing judgment. <i>Tiferet</i> and <i>Yesod</i>, which are in the middle column, begin with <i>Vav</i>-ו, representing mercy. Since <i>Chesed</i> is a higher level of kindness than <i>Netzach</i>, the <i>Vav</i>-ו representing mercy, precedes the <i>Hey</i>-ה, which represents judgment. <i>Netzach</i>, being a lower level, is the reverse. Since <i>Gevurah</i> is more severe in judgment than <i>Hod</i>, the <i>Vav-</i>ו, representing mercy, precedes the <i>Yod</i>-י which represents Kindness. <i>Hod</i>, being less severe, is the reverse. Since <i>Tiferet</i> inclines toward kindness, the <i>Yod-</i>י precedes the Hey-ה. The reverse is true of <i>Yesod</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See GRA on Sefer Yetzirah, Chapter 1, Mishnah 13 and Pri Etz Chaim, Shaar HaLulav, Chapter 3 concerning the waving of the lulav.

                "85. A name consisting of four letters would normally have twenty-four possible combinations -צירופים, but since <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה has two like letters, only twelve combinations are possible. <i>Eloh”im-</i>אלהי\"ם, which has five letters, has one hundred and twenty possible combinations. These are called “The one hundred and twenty combinations of <i>Eloh”im</i>” (ק\"כ צירופים דאלהי״ם).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Etz Chaim HaChadashim, Shaar HaShemot, Chapter 5.</i>",
                "86. The general principle of combinations (<i>Tziruf-</i>צירוף) is that the closer the resemblance of the letters to the true configuration of the name, the more they indicate mercy, the more reversed they are, the more judgment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This principle does not necessarily apply solely to the straight forward spelling of the name, but may also apply to the straight forward ordering of the Divine attributes correlating to the specific letters.</i>",
                "87. The Divine names may also be interwoven. This is called <i>Shiluv</i>-weaving (שילוב) in which the letters of one name are coupled with those of another, in alternating order. For example, the names <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה and <i>Adonai</i>-אדנ\"י may be interwoven as follows;<br>A.)<br>יהו״ה אדנ״י = י'א'ה'ד'ו'נ'ה'י or<br>B.)<br>אדנ״י יהו״ה = א'י'ד'ה'נ'ו'י'ה<br>The interweaving of two names indicates that two modes of Divine conduct are acting as one. The first letter of the weaving-<i>Shiluv</i> indicates which conduct is the more essential, to illustrate, in example (A) <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, which represents mercy, is the more essential, whereas in example (B) <i>Adonai-</i>אדנ\"י, which represents <i>Malchut</i> and judgment is the more essential.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">96</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishnat Chasidim, Masechet Shemot, Chapter 1; Also see Pri Etz Chaim, Shaar HaBerachot, Chapter 7.</i>",
                "88. Just as the letters have numerical values, so do the vowels. The vowels are composed of lines and points. A point, which resembles the letter <i>Yod</i>-י, has the numerical value of ten. A line, which resembles the letter <i>Vav</i>-ו, has the numerical value of six. The numerical values of the vowels are therefore;<br><i>Komatz</i> ( ָ ) = 16 – <i>Keter</i><br><i>Patach</i> ( ַ ) = 6 – <i>Chochmah</i><br><i>Tzeirei</i> ( ֵ ) = 20 – <i>Binah</i><br><i>Segol</i> ( ֶ ) = 30 – <i>Chesed</i><br><i>Shvah</i> ( ְ ) = 20 – <i>Gevurah</i><br><i>Cholem</i> ( ֹ ) = 10 – <i>Tiferet</i><br><i>Cheerik</i> ( ִ ) = 10 – <i>Netzach</i><br><i>Koobootz</i> ( ֻ ) = 30 – <i>Hod</i><br><i>Shoorook</i> ( ּ ) = 10 – <i>Yesod</i><br>No Vowel – <i>Malchut</i>",
                "89. There is a Divine name of seventy-two which is comprised of seventy-two three letter units. These are derived from the intertwining of the letters in three Biblical verses (Exodus 14:19 – 21) each of which contains seventy-two letters. The first letters in each of the seventy-two units are the letters of the first verse in their natural order. The middle letters of each of the units are the letters of the second verse, backwards, and the last letters are the letters of the third verse, again in natural order. This name generally indicates the aspect of kindness. However, in the Kabbalah teachings of the Holy Arizal, when “the name of seventy-two” is mentioned, it usually refers to the extension of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה that has the numerical value of 72-<i>Av</i>-ע\"ב rather than this name.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">97</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Zohar toward the end of the book of Shemot; See Rashi, to Talmud Bavli, Sukka 45a; Also see Pardes Rimonim by Rabbeinu Moshe Cordovero, Shaar Pratei HaShemot, Chapter 5, and elsewhere.</i>",
                "90. The Divine names reflect <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה actions toward the world. When in Scripture, one name is used and another is then introduced in its stead or added to it, this indicates a change of Divine influence toward the world. This comes about either through <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה initiative or as a response to man’s deeds. When, for instance, the name <i>Eloh”im-</i>אלהי״ם is used and is then exchanged for <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, it indicates that the Divine influence changed from Judgment to Mercy.",
                "91. <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה influences the world in accordance with its needs and as a response to man’s actions. When man acts meritoriously, <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה responds with kindness and revelation, and if, heaven forbid, man acts otherwise, <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה responds in kind. These different influences result from the needs of the recipients, and in no way indicate a change in the Giver, blessed is He, who is unchanging.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">98</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Zohar, Idra Rabba, Pg. 141.</i>",
                "92. <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה influences the world in a multitude of ways, each of which has its own specific name.

                "93. Because each name represents a specific Divine action or aspect, it is important to have the proper intentions and concentration when uttering them during prayer.

The proper pronunciation of the soft Dalet-ד, when there is no <i>Dagesh</i>, is like the sound of the letters TH when saying the words “This” or “That,” which is different than the pronunciation of TH when saying the words “Thought” or “Thanks.”</i> These seven double letters represent the seven lower <i>Sefirot</i>, <i>Chesed</i>, <i>Gevurah</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzach</i>, <i>Hod</i>, <i>Yesod</i>, and <i>Malchut</i>, and are therefore pronounced hard and soft corresponding to Chesed (Kindness) and Rachamim (Mercy).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since these represent the “System of Justice”, they also possess kindness, as indicated by the soft pronunciation of these letters. Mercy is indicated by the hard pronunciation of the letters and judgment is indicated by the letter itself. All twenty-two letters represent the paths by which the ten sefirot are connected and inter-included. The “Three Mothers” (א'מ'ש) represent the horizontal paths. The seven double letters (ב'ג'ד'כ'פ'ר'ת) represent the vertical paths and the twelve simple letters (ה'ו'ז'ח'ט'י'ל'נ'ס'ע'צ'ק) represent the diagonal paths.</i> <br>The third category of letters consists of the twelve remaining letters, which represent the diagonal “pipes”:<br>Hey<br>(ה)<br>Vav<br>(ו)<br>Zayin<br>(ז)<br>Chet<br>(ח)<br>Tet<br>(ט)<br>Yod<br>(י)<br>Lamed (ל)<br>Nun<br>(נ)<br>Samech (ס)<br>Ayin<br>(ע)<br>Tzaddik (צ)<br>Kof<br>(ק)<br>The twenty-two letters represent twenty-two primary creative forces that are expressions of the ten <i>Sefirot</i>.

Through the contemplation of this process one can attain a deeper understanding of <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה conduct toward the world. For example, though <i>Gevurah</i> is the conduct of judgment and punishment, we know that it arises from <i>Chesed</i>. It, therefore, is ultimately an act of kindness rather than a desire for vengeance on the part of <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, blessed is He.

Another aspect of the <i>Sefirot</i> is that of “Enclothing” (<i>Heetlabshoot-</i>התלבשות), whereby one conduct is concealed in and acts through a second conduct, which is the external expression of the inner, motivating one. The revealed conduct is considered to be the garment of the conduct concealed within it. Scripture thus states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Proverbs 27:5</i> “Good is a revealed rebuke coming from a hidden love,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See #23</i> for example, a father who punishes or disciplines his child does so out of great love of the child and for his ultimate betterment, by correcting the negative characteristics he sees in him. If he did not care for the child, he would not be moved to discipline him. However, to the casual observer it may seem to be cruel. In such a case, the love and kindness of the father is enclothed, so to speak, within the external expression of punishment and discipline.\r<br><br>112B. Sometimes in <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה relationship to Israel, the conduct of kindness is enclothed in that of judgment, for their ultimate good, as Scripture states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 8:5</i> “As a man chastens his son, so does the <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה your God chasten you.” So too, concerning the suffering of the righteous,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See #10</i> the sages stated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Yoma 87a</i> “It is good for the righteous that [<i>HaShem</i>] does not countenance [their transgressions] in this world.” Scripture describes punishment as the concealment of <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה countenance, as it is written,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 31:18</i> “I shall surely conceal my countenance on that day.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The deeper meaning of this verse is, “I shall surely conceal my inner aspect (Panim-פנים) on that day.” This signifies that <i>HaShem’s</i> kindness, which is the inner, motivating force, is concealed by judgement, which is expressed in its stead.</i>",

The concept of enclothing is related to that of lights (<i>Orot</i>) and vessels (<i>Keilim</i>) in that a vessel limits and conceals the light and revelation within it in proportion to its density and/or lack of transparency.

For example, <i>Keter</i>, which is the underlying, motivating force in Creation, contains all three categories of light. That which we understand of <i>Keter</i>, i.e., that <i>HaShem’s</i> ultimate intent is good and benefits all, is <i>Ohr Pnimi</i> – the Inner Light. The increased perception and revelation of <i>Keter</i> as it will be in the coming world is <i>Ohr Makif HaChozer</i>-אור מקיף החוזר-The Rebounding Encompassing Light. <i>HaShem’s</i> ultimate and essential purpose for the creation of the world, however, is unknowable and is called, “The Direct Encompassing Light.</i> closely.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the larger scheme, there also are two categories of light: <i>Ohr Memalleh</i>-אור ממלה-The Filling Light, is the light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה, blessed is He, which fills all worlds, whereas <i>Ohr Sovev-</i>אור סובב-The Surrounding Light is the transcendent light of <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה that surrounds all worlds.</i>",
                "117.

Because discernments begin to arise in <i>Binah</i>, its light may be enclothed within the seven lower <i>Sefirot</i> as an inner light (<i>Ohr Pnimi</i> – אור פנימי). Nonetheless, due to the limitations of the receiving vessels, (rather than any limitation in <i>Binah</i> itself), only a fraction of its light is enclothed within them. Since <i>Chochmah</i> is not as absolute a kindness and mercy as <i>Keter</i>, its light may penetrate their vessels momentarily, but rebounds instantly due to their inability to grasp it. It therefore represents the Encompassing Rebounding light (<i>Ohr Makif Hachozer</i> – אור מקיף החוזר). <i>Keter</i> is absolute and unqualified Kindness and Mercy and therefore it represents the direct encompassing light (<i>Ohr Makif Hayashar</i> – אור מקיף הישר). It cannot be grasped at all within the seven lower <i>Sefirot</i> and as such, is beyond comprehension and exceedingly hidden.",

The second stage was the introduction of the name of <i>Mah</i>-מ״ה-45 representing mercy. This is the world of <i>Tikkun</i> – Repair.

Because the conduct of <i>AV</i>-ע\"ב (the tenth millennium) is above comprehension, it is compared to the skull, (which is sealed), and its hair.

                "168. The world of <i>Tikkun</i> is called, “The world of Streaks\" (<i>Olam HaBrudim</i>). Since the intended goal of creation is to achieve <i>Olam Habba</i> – The world of <i>Akudim</i>, therefore conceptually, the order of these stages is <i>Olam Akudim</i>, <i>Nekudim</i> and <i>Brudim</i>. However, in order to bring this about, the order in time is reversed, so that the world of <i>Tohu</i> (<i>Nekudim</i>) precedes that of <i>Tikkun</i> (<i>Brudim</i>), which precedes and brings about <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה ultimate intention in creation – <i>Olam Habba</i> (<i>Akudim</i>).

                "170. The fulfillment of every Mitzvah leaves an eternal impression and is established forever.

The seven lower <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Atik</i> become enclothed within <i>Arich</i>.",
                "172. As previously mentioned, there are seven repairs of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Keter</i>, called <i>Tikunei D'Gulgalta</i> – the seven repairs of the skull. These arise from the conduct of <i>Atik</i> through the enclothing of its seven lower sefirot within <i>Arich</i>. As a result, <i>Atik</i> is enclothed within the whole of <i>Atzilut.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">238</sup><i class=\"footnote\">GRA on Etz Chaim, 87.</i>",
                "173. When considering the world of <i>Atzilut</i> in general, <i>Atik</i> and <i>Arich</i> are not differentiated from each other, but act together as aspects of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. As such, they are called <i>Atika Kadisha</i> since, “He is called according to his deeds,” as mentioned above. Early Kabbalistic literature refers to <i>Adam Kadmon</i> as <i>Tzachtzechut</i> – The Exceedingly Brilliant World.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">239</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shaarei Kedushah, translated as Gates of Holiness, Part 3, Gate 1.</i>",
                "174. In so far as all the conducts of all the worlds are relative to this world, they have bounds and limitations. Even though <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, in His omnipotence, could have created boundless worlds, He did not desire to do this, but rather, chose to set aside His infinite power within Creation and create finite worlds.",
                "175. As mentioned previously, in His relation to worlds, <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה is called according to His actions, therefore when His conduct changes, His name changes accordingly. This is described as one name being withdrawn and replaced by another. Thus, when He acts in a limitless fashion, He is called <i>Ein Sof</i> – The Unlimited. When it arose in His will to create limited worlds, it is considered that He withdrew His limitless conduct – <i>Ein Sof</i> from that “Place” wherein those worlds were destined to be, thus giving them the possibility of existence. This is called <i>Tzimtzum Ha'Ein Sof</i> – “The constriction of the limitless.” This withdrawal of the limitless conduct, which is the ultimate goodness, resulted in a condition of severity – <i>Din</i>, proportional to the degree of its withdrawal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">240</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Klach Pitchei Chochmah, Petach 24 and 26.</i> However, the withdrawal was not absolute, but rather, a residue – <i>Reshimu</i> of His previous conduct remained. He then drew into this residue – <i>Reshimu</i> a limited revelation of His goodness according to the capacity of the worlds to receive. This revelation is the attribute of Mercy and is called <i>Kav</i> – a “Ray” or “Thread.” All the conducts came about through this Ray.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">241</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Nefesh HaChaim, Shaar 3 and Ch. 7.</i>",
                "176. All the Divine conducts unfolded from this Ray in the following order;<br>1. <i>Adam Kadmon</i> – The Eternal Conduct;<br>2. His Branches – i.e.;<br>A. <i>AV</i>-ע\"ב – Skull & Hair<br>B. <i>SAG</i>-ס\"ג – Ears – Hearing, Nose – Smell, Mouth – Speaking (World of Akudim – Bundles)<br>C. <i>BAN</i>-ב\"ן – Eyes – Sight, The world of Tohu, The world of Points (Din – Judgment)<br>D. <i>MAH</i>-מ\"ה – Radiance of the Forehead, The world of Tikkun (The Joining of the conduct of mercy – <i>MAH</i>-מ״ה with Judgment – <i>BAN</i>-ב״ן.)<br>3.

                "177. The above-mentioned levels refer to the world of <i>Atzilut</i> and higher. Though enumerated here in a general way they are elaborated upon extensively in Etz Chaim. Nonetheless, it must be clearly understood that all the writings of the Ari”zal are altogether allegorical.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">242</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Nefesh HaChaim, Shaar 3, Ch. 7.</i>",
                "178. Concerning this, Rabbi Chaim Vital wrote,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">243</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shaar HaHakdamot.</i> “This is clear, that supernally there is neither body nor any attribute of corporeality,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">244</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah Ch. 1, as well as Rambam’s 13 principles of faith.</i> God forbid. All these images and forms are not actual, but are merely there to enable us to comprehend, so that man should have some understanding of these supernal, conceptual matters, that are beyond his intellectual scope. Therefore, permission was given to speak in such terms, though certainly, it is not thus, as scripture emphatically states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">245</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:15</i> “Neither did you behold any image.” This principle also applies to the form of the Hebrew letters, which also symbolize the supernal conducts. Certainly, no letters or vowels actually exist supernally. They are merely symbolic.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">246</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Etz Chaim HaChadashim, Heichal Adam Kadmon, branch 3.</i>",
                "179. As Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (the Ramchal) states,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">247</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Klach Pitchei Chochmah, Petach 7.</i> “This is certain, that all these matters of form and corporeality which we mention in regard to the <i>Sefirot</i>, are not possible by any stretch of the imagination, for that would be a total denial of <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה unity, God forbid, as scripture explicitly states ‘You did not behold any images.’ Accordingly, Rambam explains<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">248</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah, Ch. 7.</i> that the prophets received Divine communication through allegorical vision, such as the almond branch that Jeremiah beheld, that is, when <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה, blessed is He, desired to communicate Divine concepts to the prophets, He did so through the prophetic vision, using examples that would enable the mind of the prophet to grasp these matters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">249</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Klach Pitchei Chochmah, Petach 8 and 9. Also see Choker Umekubal and Da’at Tevunot p.35-36.</i> In no way did the object of the vision actually materialize. It was merely a vehicle to convey the idea. (Nonetheless, not all allegories mentioned in Kabbalah are prophetic in origin.)",
                "180. These allegories, however, are not arbitrary, but reflect actual parallels between the Divine Conducts of <i>Atzilut</i> and the created realms that result from them. To illustrate, the example of the concentric circles (<i>Igulim</i>), parallels the spherical nature of the heavens, signifying general providence, whereas the example of the upright <i>Sefirot</i> (<i>Yosher</i>), parallels the nature of man, signifying individual providence.\r<br><br>180b. These allegories, therefore, arise from the fact that matters within man, the universe, or the Torah result from and thus hint at the Divine conducts. The Mitzvot too, correlate to Divine conducts, and as such, may be understood through these allegories. Thus, it is evident that the allegories were Divinely inspired along with their inner underlying meanings. However, caution must be taken when studying Etz Chaim, since, as in all the writings of the Ari”zal, only the allegory is conveyed without any explanation of its underlying meaning, as stated in Nefesh HaChaim, “As known, <b>all</b> the words of the Ari”zal concerning the esoteric wisdom, are allegorical.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">250</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Nefesh HaChaim, Shaar 3, Ch. 7.</i>",
                "181. Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, in Choker U'Mekubal, suggests that when studying Kabbalah, one should first learn the allegory alone and only later attempt to fathom its meaning. In Klach Pitchei Chochmah he refers to the allegory as “The prophetic vision,” and to the meaning as, “The interpretation,” since both were received by Divine inspiration. The “interpretation” is found, in short, in his book Choker Umekubal and in some parts of Klach Pitchei Chochmah. Nonetheless, it is incumbent upon the reader to discern between those parts that are the “vision” and those that are the “interpretation.” If one wishes to learn the allegory directly from Etz Chaim, it is suggested that he first learn only those sections entitled <i>Mahadura Tinyana</i> (Second Edition) and skip the rest of the book. Afterwards, he may return and go over the book in its entirety. However, Kabbalistic writings pertaining to the three lower worlds, <i>Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, may not be entirely allegorical, for since they are created realms, actual conditions may be ascribed to them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">251</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beginning with Gate One, where Mahadura Tinyana is indicated, until the end of that branch.

For example, <i>Chesed</i> of <i>Briyah</i>, <i>Chesed</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> etc. are only levels within the general conduct of <i>Chesed</i>.<br>Since both the Divine conducts as they relate to each world and the components of the created worlds are called <i>Sefirot</i>, it is incumbent upon the reader, when studying Kabbalist literature, to discern between them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">278</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Choker Umekubal p.6-7.</i>",
                "203. As stated above, in His relation to a world, <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה is called according to His actions.

                "206. Actually, all the influence from <i>Atzilut</i> comes to the created worlds through <i>Malchut</i>, its lowest <i>Sefirah</i>. Therefore, the above-mentioned statement that the world of <i>Briyah</i> is influenced by <i>Binah</i>, refers to <i>Binah</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, rather than the general <i>Binah</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. The same principle applies to <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i> which are influenced by <i>Zeir Anpin</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i> and <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>. Accordingly, all the created realms are considered to be within the domain of <i>Malchut</i>.\r<br><br>206b. Everything that exists in the world of <i>Briyah</i> has its corresponding conduct in <i>Atzilut</i>. Because the matter of twelve exists in <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Atzilut</i>, it also manifests as twelve components within <i>Briyah.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">282</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sefer Yetzirah Ch. 5.</i>",
                "207. As stated previously, the world of <i>Briyah</i> was created with all its components corresponding to the Divine conducts. As such, Kabbalistic literature states that the world of <i>Briyah</i> “chained down” from the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, in that it follows the pattern of <i>Atzilut</i>. For example, since it was <i>HaShem’s-</i>יהו\"ה will to include His kindness in the conduct of the world, He created the Palace of Love – <i>Heichal Ha'Ahava</i> in <i>Briyah</i>, and since it was also His will to include Judgment – <i>Din</i>, He created the Palace of Merit – <i>Heichal Zechut</i>, within which the world is judged. This principle applies to all the components of <i>Briyah</i>.\r<br><br>207b. Thus, it can be said that the palace of Love “chained down” from the <i>Sefirah</i> of <i>Chesed</i>, and the palace of Merit, from that of <i>Gevurah</i> etc. However, obviously there is no developmental progression of “chaining down” between <i>Atzilut</i> and the created realms whatsoever, but rather, all creation was brought into being ex nihilo (out of nothing). Any other consideration would be erroneous.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">283</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Choker Umekubal, p.7.</i>",

It is the <i>Ruach</i> that receives reward and punishment, is cognizant, possesses faculties and is conscious of the senses. With its departure, death results. The <i>Neshamah</i> is a higher level that is generally beyond our consciousness. It is the source of Divine guidance and inspiration. In this sense it is sometimes referred to as a person’s <i>Mazal</i> or <i>Malach</i> (angel) since it influences him from above. Occasionally one may experience an inspirational flash from the <i>Neshamah</i> level which guides him and elevates his awareness. Therefore, the term <i>Ruach</i> refers to man’s essential identity, whereas <i>Neshamah</i> refers to that which guides him from above.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">285</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nefesh HaChaim, Shaar 1, Ch. 15, 17 and 18; For this reason the term <i>Neshamah</i> may often include within it, both <i>Chaya</i> and <i>Yechidah</i>.</i>",

It receives Divine influence directly from <i>Atzilut</i> without any intermediary level. In <i>Briyah</i> the spiritual entities themselves may be either of the aspects of <i>Ruach</i> or <i>Nefesh</i>. Those of <i>Ruach</i> are called <i>Ruchin</i> (spirits) and those of <i>Nefesh</i> are called <i>Nehorin</i> (lights).

This influence is called <i>Yechidah</i>. <br>To summarize: the level of Godliness in <i>Asiyah</i> is called <i>Yechidah</i>, that of <i>Yetzirah</i> is called <i>Chayah</i>, and that of <i>Briyah</i> is called <i>Neshamah</i>, all of which is explained by the GR\"A in Sifra D'Tzniuta.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">287</sup><i class=\"footnote\">GRA Sifra D’Tzniuta p. 1b.</i>",

This in no way contradicts his above statement. In Sifra D'Tzniuta he deals with each world specifically, as it relates to other worlds, whereas, here, he is referring to all the created worlds collectively as they relate to <i>Atzilut</i>. Only that which comes from <i>Atzilut</i> (<i>Chaya</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Yechidah</i> of <i>Asiyah</i>) may truly be considered <i>Neshamah</i>. All other levels of the created worlds [<i>Neshamah</i> of <i>Yetzirah</i> & <i>Chayah</i> of <i>Asiyah</i> etc.] come from <i>Ruach</i> and <i>Nefesh</i> of <i>Briyah</i> and thus cannot [truly] be regarded as <i>Neshamah</i>.",
                "213a. The GR\"A wrote, “You should know with certainty that our teacher Moshe perceived only on the level of <i>Briyah</i> in the palace of Desire, as stated by Rabbi Moshe Cordovero and the Ari\"zal. The remaining prophets perceived on the level of <i>Yetzirah</i>. Daniel perceived the pinnacle of <i>Asiyah</i>, which is the floor of <i>Yetzirah</i>, since he was on an intermediate level between the prophets and subsequent generations. Since then, with each generation, perception has diminished, until in these latter generations we perceive only on the level of the ‘heels’ of <i>Asiyah</i>”.\r<br><br>213b. Since each world contains within itself aspects of all other worlds, it is possible, through analogy, to comprehend, on our level, matters concerning <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, <i>Atzilut</i>, <i>Briyah</i>, <i>Yetzirah</i> and <i>Asiyah</i>, though we have no direct perception of them. Even the prophet Ezekiel, who received his prophecy outside of the land of Israel during the end of the first Temple, spoke in riddles, the full depth of which we cannot fathom. So too, the prophecy of Zechariah was in the form of sealed visions. We will not fully understand the meaning of their words until we are Divinely enlightened (in the Messianic era)."

Rather, it stands opposite the Holy of Holies of the world of <i>Briyah</i>, since no created thing can rise higher than that level.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">304</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid.</i>",
                "223. Furthermore, the seven palaces of <i>Briyah</i> of <i>Kedusha</i> also have counterparts in <i>Sitra Achara</i>. They are called,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">305</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar Pekudei pg. 263.</i> “The Seven Impure Palaces.” Their names in ascending order are:<br><i>Bor</i> – the pit<br><i>Shachat</i> – death<br><i>Duma</i> – silence<br><i>Chova</i> – debt<br><i>Sheol</i> – the grave<br><i>Tzalmavet</i> – the shadow of death<br><i>Eretz Tachteet</i> – the netherworld\r<br><br>223b. These, in turn, correspond to the seven names of the <i>Yetzer Hara </i>(the evil inclination) as follows:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">306</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Sukkah 52a.</i><br><i>Ra</i> – The evil one<br><i>Tameh</i> – The impure one<br><i>Soneh</i> – The enemy<br><i>Even Michshol</i> – The stumbling block<br><i>Arel</i> – The uncircumcised one<br><i>Satan</i> – The tempter<br><i>Tzefoni</i> – The northerner<br>The Zohar explains<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">307</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar Pekudei pg. 263.</i> at length the specific purpose of each of these. Generally, the agents of <i>Kelipah</i> have the opposite function to those of <i>Kedusha</i>. In addition, the <i>Sitra Achara</i> also consists of ten <i>Sefirot</i> which are called “The Ten <i>Sefirot</i> of <i>Kelipah</i>” or “The Counterfeit Palaces.”",
                "224. Because <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה desired to conduct the world with judgment as well as kindness, He created the <i>Sitra Achara</i>. As such, the <i>Sitra Achara</i> is considered to have come out of the attribute of judgment, since that is its sole purpose, without which, it would not have been created.",
                "225. As stated above, initially <i>HaShem-</i>יהו\"ה manifested the attribute of total judgment, represented by the name of <i>Ban</i>-ב\"ן-52. He then joined to it the attribute of mercy, represented by the name of <i>Mah</i>-מ\"ה-45, in order to bring about its rectification. Since <i>Sitra Achara</i> comes about solely from the judgment of <i>Ban</i>-ב\"ן-52, the gradual rectification brought about through <i>Mah</i>-מ\"ה-45 diminishes its function so that, ultimately, with the final rectification, <i>Sitra Achara</i> will cease to exist. Part of it will be transformed into holiness and the remainder portion will be obliterated.",
                "226. The existence of the <i>Yetzer Hara</i> (the evil inclination) and the <i>Sitra Achara</i> is only necessary during the six millennia of this world, which go according to the conduct of the six <i>Sefirot</i> – <i>Chessed</i>, <i>Gevurah</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, <i>Netzach</i>, <i>Hod</i> and <i>Yesod</i>, as stated in Talmud, “You have given us the <i>Yetzer Hara</i> for the sole purpose of earning merit.” However, beginning with the seventh millennium, which is the “coming world” and is a time of reward, (and certainly after the tenth millennium, which is the eternal conduct of <i>Adam Kadmon</i>), its purpose will be abrogated, as the Talmud states, “In the future the Holy One, Blessed Be He, will slaughter (abrogate) the <i>Yetzer Hara.</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">308</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Sukkah 52a</i>\r<br><br>226b.
