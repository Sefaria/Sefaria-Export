        "Author's Introduction": [
            "Estas son las palabras del joven Moisés, hijo de [el rabino] Jacob Cordovero, cuando reflexioné sobre los días de mi juventud. Pasaron y se desvanecieron ante mí, mientras perseguía todos los deseos y se extinguían sin esperanza. Y sucedió cuando llegué a la edad de veinte años y un vello dorado creció, que mi Señor me despertó como a un hombre que despierta de su sueño, y dijo a mi alma: \"Hasta cuándo, hija obstinada, ¿hasta cuándo te embriagarás con tus pecados? ¿Hasta cuándo permitirás que tus pensamientos impuros habiten en tu corazón y olvidarás al Señor, tu Hacedor y Creador desde el seno materno? Ahora, levántate, clama a tu Dios y vigila sus puertas día tras día. Y Él sanará el altar del Señor, que está en ruinas\". Estas son las palabras del joven Moisés, hijo de [el rabino] Jacob Cordovero. Cuando escuché la llamada, me levanté y recorrí la ciudad, los mercados y las calles buscando un lugar donde encontrar descanso que me beneficiara. Entonces, escuché una voz de la ciudad sagrada que descendía desde los cielos, mi Maestro y Rabino, el sabio cabalista, el venerable Rabi Shlomo Alkabetz, que descanse en paz, me condujo a su palacio de enseñanzas y me instruyó. Me dijo: \"Hijo mío, presta atención a mis palabras, inclina tu oído y escucha las palabras de los sabios\". Me colocó en las puertas de la sabiduría y el entendimiento, que son más dulces que la miel, y me permitió observar los misterios ocultos de la Torá.",
            "Fui a través de los días, maravillado por lo bueno y agradable que era dedicarme a esta tarea. Me dije a mí mismo: \"Cuánto me agradaría estar siempre inmerso en esta sabiduría\". Su amor me embriagaba constantemente, y sus amantes palabras me deleitaban en todo momento.",
            "Cuando llegó el momento de cumplir mis votos, me presenté ante los libros del sagrado Rabi Shimon bar Yojai, que descanse en paz, y los estudié. Mi corazón se movía como las olas del mar y se tambaleaba como un barco en alta mar en las profundidades de las enseñanzas. Dije: \"Tomaré la corona del erudito que llevo en mi cinturón y la colocaré sobre la cabeza de cada rebaño, uno por uno. Estableceré un orden en mi mente, separando uno de otro, y cuando mi corazón se fortalezca en esta enseñanza, me dirigiré a otras\".",
            "Entonces, vi que mi consejo era recto y justo desde el Señor, desde los cielos. Abrí el rollo de un libro ante mí para que me sirviera de memoria y me guiara en sus asuntos y sus órdenes. Lo llamé \"Pardes Rimmonim\" (El Jardín de Granadas) para indicar las razones conocidas. Primero, esta sabiduría es la sabiduría de la Cábala, que se conoce como \"Pardes\". Segundo, que esta revelación sería un consuelo tanto en este mundo como en el próximo, y sustentaría todos mis años. Esto es \"Rimmonim\", granadas, que planté para mi deleite. Y es como granados, siendo sus portales los árboles plantados en él. Y sus capítulos son granadas. Y en ellos están dispuestos nuevos conceptos, uno al lado del otro, no uno ni dos, sino llenos como granadas, por lo tanto, se les llama 'Pardes Rimmonim' (El Jardín de Granadas). Y vimos que el rollo está dividido en treinta y dos secciones, y las llamamos 'puertas' para que sean puertas para entrar en el interior de la Torá y sus secretos. Además, dividimos estas puertas en capítulos, algunos de ellos son cortos y otros largos, según la naturaleza del tema en cada capítulo. Miramos hacia el pozo para que nadie entre en nuestras puertas sin las llaves y los métodos de las puertas, ya que, Dios no lo quiera, esto podría causar daño en lugar de beneficio. Aquel a quien se le han entregado las llaves, que sean del tamaño adecuado para abrir nuestras puertas, podemos estar seguros de que las abrirá. Hay varios conjuntos de llaves en esta sabiduría, y no esperamos de aquel que se sumerge en la explicación de los asuntos repetir dos veces lo que ya hemos escrito, ya que esto prolongaría nuestra labor. Por lo tanto, no avanzaremos desde el capítulo hasta que sepamos que lo que necesita para su comprensión no será repetido, sino que nos apoyaremos en lo que ya hemos escrito en el capítulo anterior. Así, sus pies no abandonarán esta puerta hasta que la entienda adecuadamente, y luego continuará su camino sin temor. Y con todo esto, no retiraremos nuestras manos de explicar, como escribimos en el lugar tal o como explicamos en el lugar tal. Y estos son los nombres de las puertas, cada una con sus letras."

We named it \"Ten and Not Nine\", because it explains how there was agreement among our sages, elders, and prophets in the understanding that the Sefirot are ten and not nine or eleven. The Gate comprises 10 chapters. Chapter 1 is the explanation of the Mishna in Sefer Yetzira 1:3 \"Ten is the number of the ineffable Sefirot. They number ten, etc.\"",

We named it \"The Reason [Flavor] for Atzilut\", because it explains a reason for why there are ten [Sefirot], no less and no more, and the reason for the reality of Atzilut itself. The Second Gate comprises seven chapters. Chapter 1 explains one reason according to R' Azriel and the understanding of R' Yehuda Chiyiti of this reason, and his criticism.",

There are Ten Chapters. Chapter 1 reviews the thoughts of R' Menachem of Recanti who believes [the Sefirot] are vessels.",

It explains the frequency of Emanation for each Sefirah apart from others, among the revealed types. Also, it details four configurations of the Sefirot within Chochmah, Binah, Tiferet, and Malchut, and the first statement from the Zohar – all created through Chochmah.",

And she is called this way because she completes the fiftieth year in the secret of the Fifty Gates [of Understanding], and she is the fiftieth year, which is the gate that is more marvellous than Moses our teacher, may he rest in peace, as you say (Psalms 8:6): “You have made him a little less [מעט] than divine” [in the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Rosh Hashanah 21b this verse is applied to Moses]. You should not say מעט but מ\"ט [which has the numerical value of 49, thus one less than 50] etc. And this degree [Binah] is called by this name [יובל] when she flows into the fifty gates and gives an influx of abundance and good. And this is the meaning of Yuval, as “and towards a stream [יובל, Yuval] it will extend its roots” (Jeremiah 17:8). And as it will revolve until it has reached the fiftieth gate then in/through it [the fiftieth gate] it will cling to Chochmah (Wisdom). And on this it is said to Moses: “Be silent, thus [כך] it has come up in thought” [Babylonian Talmud, tractate Menachot 29b]. כך is in Gematria 40 [the text reads נ', 50, which is probably a mistake for מ', 40], while silence is in Chochmah which is Yod [י', 10]. And it has come up in thought which is Chochmah. [thus the verse “Be silent, thus it has come up in thought” refers to the fiftieth Gate of Understanding as it counts 10 (Be silent) + 40 (thus) = 50, ascending to Chochmah]. And because of this he [Moses] did not grasp the subject of the death of Rabbi Aqiva [as Moses had attained to only the fourty-ninth Gate of Understanding], because his death was on the side of the judgement, in the secret of the ascent, as will be explained in the Gate of the Soul [Gate 31 of the Pardes Rimonim], chapter 5. And we will return to our subject that in the cleaving of this gate to Chochmah, then it [this gate] is Yuval and then the whole world is mercy and great abundance, liberty and deliverance, and then we will call this degree [Binah] Yovel/Yuval.

For the whole object of punishment is asked, it is the evil inclination and the Shell, there will be no Shell and there will be no evil inclination. And it is said that the reason for their creation. in the will of the Creator, is to be that the world and its creatures needed to receive their sustenance and livelihood by the power of law and justice and righteousness, and if they were all non-elective angels in their actions, the world would not benefit from their actions, because they are forced act as angels. And for this reason, man must have a choice, and be inhabited by the evil inclination and the good inclination, that if he, by his own nature, would want to incline towards good, his evil inclination, Samael, would incline him to evil on his left; and when he wants to incline towards evil, on his right will be his good inclination to guilt him, and remind him of the words of his Creator in such a way that he will be rewarded for the inclination, good or bad. And to judge a man according to his deeds, it is necessary that he have aspects which are unclean – as like a slave who rebels against his master – to torment the wicked, so that his wickedness and evils in their numbers will cling to wickedness on its proper side, and so he will receive punishment.
