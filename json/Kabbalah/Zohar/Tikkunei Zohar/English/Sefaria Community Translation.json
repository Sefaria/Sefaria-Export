The bad maidservant is the pit, and \"the pit\" is the male, and we tech regarding this \"a boor [bor] cannot fear sin\" (Avot 2:5), this is because this boor has no [true] fear of God.",

There is fear of God which comes due to God's Kingship, which includes all the mitzvot of the Torah, because there is fear that comes because of Torah, which is the middle pillar, and this is [the name] Havay\"ah. In that way the masters of the Mishnah said: \"Torah is great because it leads to action\" (cf. Kiddushin 40b), because if a person does not know Torah, and the reward for the mitzvot, and the punishments for the transgressions, and who created Torah and who gave it to Israel, how will that person actually fear and observe the mitzvot? And in that vein David said to Shlomo his son \"know the God of your father and serve God.\" (I Chron. 28:9)",

            "These are the twelve faces and twelve wings of the heavenly beasts, as it is written (Ezekiel 1:8) \"Each of the four had the face of a lion on the right\" - this is the white of the eye. \"Each of the four had the face of an ox on the left\" - this is the red of the eye. \"Each of them had the face of an eagle\" - this is the green of the eye. And it is written, \"Each had four faces... and four wings.\" - this all comes to twenty-four. And these wings are the eyelids, which are referred to as (Exodus 32:15) \"they were inscribed on one side (<i>zeh</i>) and the other side (<i>zeh</i>).\" [So too,] about the heavenly beasts it is said (Isaiah 6:3) \"One (<i>zeh</i>) would call to the other (<i>zeh</i>), Holy! Holy! Holy! The Lord of Hosts! His presence fills the earth.\" Certainly, they are called \"<i>zeh</i> and <i>zeh</i>\", just like the two sides of the tablets of Torah, inscribed on one side and the other. These are inscribed tablets of stone, and that stone is the Foundation Stone from which the earth is formed. And this is the pupil of the eye, of which it is written (Zechariah 3:9) \"A single stone with seven eyes.\" These are the seven skins of the eye, of which it is said (Psalms 119:164) \"I praise you seven times a day.\" And this is the Holy Regency, as it is written, (Psalms 118:22) \"The stone that the builders rejected will be the chief cornerstone.\" Who are these 'builders'? They are they masters of the Mishnah who built structures in the world, and the deciders of law (<i>Halachah</i>) who rejected Her in exile. [Therefore,] it is written of Her, \"will be the chief cornerstone. For she is Moses' <i>Halachah</i> from Sinai, received by Moses. Although Her pupil was black, through it and from it will the Holy One light up the world, for He will illuminate Her.  ",
            "These eyes illuminated by Torah, of which it is written (Psalms 145:15) \"The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them food when it is due.\" Man must, therefore, to delve into them regularly: morning, evening and afternoon, always, the Holy One looking into Her eyes - as it is written (Deuteronomy 11:12) \"The eyes of the Lord your God are always looking at her (the land of Israel), from the beginning of the year until its end.\" And we connect the words [in the two verses], the daily sacrifice (<i>tamid</i>) and \"the eyes of the Lord God always (<i>tamid</i>) looking at her\". And the (<i>Tamid</i>) sacrifice was [offered] in the morning and the evening, like the recitation of the Shema prayer. From this we learn that one who recites the Shema in the evening and the morning, it is as if one has fulfilled the commandment of continually studying Torah, day and night, as it is written (Joshua 1:8) \"Let not this Book of Torah cease from your lips, but recite it day and night.\""

            "The face of the Queen, these are the forty-nine facets of purity (through which the Torah can be interpreted), shining like a rose, white and red, drawing in from the right and from the left. White, from the clarity of humility; Red, from the shame of fear - <i>yar'e boshet</i> (an anagram of <i>Bereshit</i>, \"In the beginning\"). When [Her face] becomes golden-green, this is the Groom who has risen up to the sun, who is the Supernal Mother. From these three colours of the face emanate the seventy-two facets (of the divine name), whose numerical value equals that of <i>Hesed</i> (Loving-kindness), and which is comprised of two hundred and sixteen letters, the numerical value of which equals that of <i>Gevurah</i> (Might). This is the mystery [hinted at in the words] (Exodus 34:6) <i>Vaya'avor Ado-nai</i>, \"And God passed before\", which itself is the mystery of  <i>'Ibbur</i> (Impregnation or intercalation. Both <i>Vaya'avor</i> and <i>'Ibbur</i> are comprised of the letters representing 72 and 216).

Therefore, the image of the Queen has the nose straight on her face, where the two nostrils are the two true prophets. The mouth is the daughter of the Queen, and in it is the tongue of erudition (cf. Isaiah 50:4), which is Righteousness, of which is written (Song of Songs 4:3) \"Your lips are a thread of scarlet, Your mouth is lovely -\" in Torah. The mouth is the totality of all: it contains sound and speech, which are [the divine letter] <i>Vav</i> and <i>Hei</i>, and it contains breath, which is <i>Hei</i>, and the still, small mouth is <i>Yud</i>. [Therefore, the mouth is] adorned with the divine name, and this is the meaning of \"Your lips are a thread of scarlet, Your mouth is lovely.\"",
