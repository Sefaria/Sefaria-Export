            "The prophet Elijah, of blessed memory, opened, and said: Eternal Hidden Master of the worlds! You are He whose Unity is infinite and absolute, and therefore indivisible. You are He<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> the First Cause</i>, transcendent beyond all that is above, and concealed behind all that is concealed. No thought whatsoever can grasp You. But You are He who brought forth ten rectifications - we call them the ten sefirot Atzilut - with which to regulate<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> the powerful illumination of Your Light that flows down through</i> hidden worlds that are not revealed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">t he worlds of Adam Kadmon and Atzilut</i>, as well as worlds that are revealed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Beriya, Yetzira and Asiya</i>. Indeed, it is through these<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> the ten sefirot of each universe</i> that You are hidden from human beings<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> so they can exist and not be overwhelmed by Your Light</i>. You are He who binds them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> sefirot together</i> and unifies them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> to Yourself</i>. And inasmuch as You are within them, anyone who separates one from the other is regarded as having caused a separation in You<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> and Your Absolute Unity</i>.",
            "You also arranged<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> a system of three lower worlds, Beriya, Yetzira, and Asiya, that serve as</i> \"garments\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> to further cover over the sefirot of Atzilut and protect us from the intensity of Your Light </i>. It is from these \"garments\" that the souls<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Neshama, Ruach and Nefesh</i> of human beings originate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The sefirot of Atzilut are clothed within these \"garments\", and for this reason </i>. They are called<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> \"limbs\" of</i> a \"body\" relative to the \"clothes\" that cover over them. These<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> limbs</i> are arranged as follows: chesed (or loving-kindness) is the right arm, gevura (restraint) is the left arm, and tiferet (harmony) is the torso. Netzach (dominance) and hod (empathy) are the two legs, and yesod (foundation or channel) is the body's extremity, the sign of the Holy Covenant. Malchut (kingship) is the mouth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> of the holy covenant</i>. It is therefore called the \"Oral Torah\".",
            "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Above these \"limbs\" is the \"head\" in which </i> chochma (wisdom) is the<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> right</i>  brain, the seat of thought, and bina (understanding) is<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> the left brain and</i> the heart, the heart's ability to discern. Concerning these, it is written, \"The hidden things belong to G‑d <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> corresponding to chochma</i> our G‑d<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> corresponding to bina</i>\". (Deut. 29:28). Keter Elyon (Supernal Crown) is the keter of malchut, concerning which it is said, \"I<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> G-d</i> declare the end from the beginning\". (Isaiah 46:10).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Keter surrounds and contains the two hemispheres of the brain, chochma and bina, like</i> the leather box of the Tefillin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> that surrounds and contains the parchments </i>. Within<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> this unified system of \"limbs\" and \"head\" which constitute one \"body\" or \"tree,\" is the Divine Name \"spelled-out\" with alefs, i.e. Mah, thus</i>: <b>Yud-vav-dalet = 20, hei-alef = 6, vav-alef-vav= 13, hei-alef= 6.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> With this name You determine </i> the way<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> in which Your Light is transmitted through the sefirot </i> of Atzilut. This name therefore fills and saturates<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> the \"roots\" and the \"trunk\" of the \"tree\" of the sefirot, together with</i> its \"limbs\" and \"branches\", as water irrigates and saturates a tree. It<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> the \"tree\"</i> then grows in proportion to how much \"water\" flows through it.",
            "Eternal Hidden Master of the worlds, You are the Supreme Cause of all causes and the Origin of all effects! You water the tree with that flow. And that flow is the very life-force of the \"tree\" - like a soul to a body. But no \"human\" likeness or \"bodily\" image exists in Your Infinite Essence with which we might liken You to anything within or without. You alone created the starry galaxies and the earth. From the galaxies above, You brought forth sun and moon, planets and starry constellations. On the earth below, You brought forth trees and plants, the Garden of Eden and<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> fields of</i> grass, living creatures, birds and fish, animals and humanity. Through them<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> through all that exists Below</i> , You make known that which is Above, <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">You also make known </i>how all that is above<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> in Atzilut</i> and below<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> in Beriya, Yetzira and Asiya </i> is regulated, and how the higher worlds may be known from the lower. But knowledge of Your Essence is completely impossible."

            "\n“…For my head is drenched with dew….” (Song of Songs 5:2). What is “drenched with dew”? And the Holy One, Bless be He said, you may think that, from the day that the Holy Temple was destroyed, I entered my house and dwelling place, but it is not so. I will not enter as long as you are in exile. Here is your sign, “My head is drenched in dew”. הא is the Shechinah in exile, her completion and her life is “dew” טל, which is יוד-הא-ואו and the letter values sums up to 39 טל, dew. It fills up the Shechinah from the source of all the supernal emanations. The Faithful Shepherd immediately rose with the holy patriarchs along with him. Up to this point is the secret of the unification. From here on the first portion of the concealed Torah."
