            "\"And God said, Let there be light.\" and, behold, Rabbi Yitzchak said, \"There was\"",
            "Rabbi Judah said that this implies 'light' was already in existence, as indicated by \"there was\". It is not written, \"there <i>became</i> light\", but \"there <i>was</i>\".",
            "When the Holy One, Blessed be He, looked over the generations of wicked men, he stored the light for the righteous ones. Thus it is written, \"And from the wicked their light is withholden,\" (Job 38:15) and, \"light is sown for the righteous and gladness for those upright in hearts\" (Ps. 97:11) And so, God said \"Let there be light\" just as it is written, \"Who raised up the righteous man from the east,\" (Is. 41:1)",
            "\"And God saw the light, it was good;\" What was it that He saw, that was good? Rabbi Hiyya said that this implies that He foresaw the actions of the wicked, and still stored the light, for reasons we've said before. But, Rabbi Aba says, \"And God saw the light, it was good;\" because it was good to <i>hide</i>. He saw its radiance beaming from one end of the world to the other, and He saw that it was better to conceal it, so that sinners might not benefit from it. Rabbi Shimon said that no anger or judgement may be found in \"And God saw the light, it was good;\" After all, it is written, \"Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel\" (Num. 24:1) and this is proven by the verse's closing, \"And God divided the light from the darkness\" (Gen. 1:4), to snuff wrath, even though the Holy One, Blessed be He, later (re-)combined the two. ",
            "Come and behold, the supernal radiance [Binah], continues to radiate. Through this radiance, it should bring gladness to all. This is the right, which was crowned with the right to make the engravings. It is written, \"How great is Your goodness, which You have laid upon those who fear You and which You have wrought for they who trust in You\" (Ps. 31:20). \"How great is Your goodness\" alludes to the primordial light that the Holy One, blessed be He, stored away. \"They who fear You\" alludes to the righteous who fear sin, who are aforementioned. \"And there was evening and there was morning, the first day\" (Gen. 1:5) \"And there was evening\" from the side of darkness [Nukva] \"and there was morning\" from the side of light [Zeir Anpin]. And since they join together as one, it is written they are the \"first day.\"",
            "Rabbi Judah says, \"If this was so, why is 'there was evening and there was morning' repeated each day?\" It is to acknowledge that there cannot be day without night, nor night without day, and that they are inseparable.",
            "Rabbi Yossi said, \"The day on which the primal light emerged extended into all the other days, as the word 'day' is repeated in them all.\" Rabbi Elazar said, \"We learn this: they are all called mornings, because morning only relates to the primal light.\" Rabbi Shimon said, \"The first day accompanies all of them, and that all are contained within it.\" This shows that there is no true distinction between them, and that all are one.",
            "\"And God said, Let there be Light.\" alluding to light spreading downwards. These are the angels created on the first day, who exist on the right side.",
            "\"And God saw the light, it was good;\" (Gen. 1:4) in which the participle <i>אֶת</i> joins the opaque reflection [Malchut] with the shining reflection [Zeir Anpin] – this union is what was \"good\". Thus says Rabbi Elazar, \"'<i>אֶת</i>' includes the angels who come from the side of light, and shine as brightly as the primal light.\""

        "Noach": [
            "And Rabbi Hezekiah said, Israel is deserving of their share, for the Holy One, blessed be He, delights in them and gives them the holy Torah, takes care of them, and provides them with food to sustain themselves above and below, so that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not dominate over them alone. And they are able to repel from themselves all accusers and all hardships, because they are the share of His glory and His wealth, as you say (Deuteronomy 32:9) \"For a portion of the Lord is His people Jacob, the lot of His inheritance.”.",
            "Come and see, on the day of Rosh Hashanah, the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits in judgment over the world, and all the inhabitants of the world come for reckoning, and there is not one that doesn't come for reckoning. And the books of the living and the dead are opened on that day.",
            "And the Holy One, Blessed be He, due to his delight in them, gives them a time to refrain from all the accusers above, who frighten them every time the judgement is allowed on the world. On this day, the people of Israel appear to stir up compassion upon them. And how? With the shofar.",
            "This sound that comes forth, ascends above and wakes up the heavenly shofar. Then, mercy is aroused from His place. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, stands from the throne of judgment and sits on the throne of mercy, He has mercy on Israel, and He does not give permission for the accusers to accuse them.",
            "And Israel stands justified before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and they blow the shofar, and mercy is aroused. For that sound that comes forth, it arouses His mercy. And then, the accuser can't stand before the throne of mercy, for he does not come from that side, and the prosecutor is not found.",
            "On the Day of Atonement, which is the seal of the judgment, the people of Israel stand in their purity. On that day, so that the accuser might not approach the Sanctuary, they offer him a goat, which comes from the side of impure winds, and he is occupied with it, and does not approach the Sanctuary to do harm. And then, faces are illuminated, and Israel is refined from it.",
            "At another time, when the sins of people have increased, this accuser, at the time of judgment, is aroused over the sins of the world. Then he comes and is found as an accuser before the Holy One, blessed be He, and troubles the Sanctuary, and all faces become sad, and judgment is found. And because of this, the end of all flesh comes before me. Certainly before me, to bring a claim over the sins of the sons of the world, which they have caused.",
            "Come and see, every person who does and observes the precepts of the Torah, his soul is preserved in his body, for he is good and will not be punished, and the angel of death will not have dominion over him. And every person who does not observe and does not fulfill the precepts of the Torah and transgresses them, then the angel of death will have dominion over him.",
            "Come and see, the Ark represents the body. Noah and his wife represent Yud Heh (Yah). Shem and his wife represent Vav Heh (part of the tetragrammaton YHWH). And thus forms the full name of God, Yud Heh Vav Heh. Japheth and his wife represent Yud Heh, and Ham and his wife, and they are a replica.",
            "And it says (Genesis 6:13) \"And God said to Noah\", God, this is the Shekhina (Divine presence), \"The end of all flesh\" etc. (Genesis 6:16) \"Make a window for the Ark\", this is a mystery of the body. \"You, your sons\" etc., men alone, and women alone. (Genesis 6:22) \"And Noah made\", this is a holy covenant. \"According to all that God commanded him\", this is the Shekhina. (Genesis 7:1) \"And the Lord said to Noah\", here is the attribute of mercy.",
            "(Genesis 7:2) \"And of the beasts that are not clean, two, male and female\", for this comes from the side of impurity, and on this, He said, \"and I will destroy\". And take a look, in it there are only two, and not seven, seven, as it is written for the birds of heaven, four pairs of male and female, to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth. (Genesis 7:9) \"Two by two they came\", look and notice, from what it said earlier \"And of the beasts that are not clean\" and after \"two by two”.",
            "Rabbi Judah said, Come and see, there is not a single night when the soul does not depart from the body of a person, which is called a dove. As it is written, (Genesis 8:8) \"And he sent out the dove\". \"The waters had subsided\", these are the intentional waters, as you said (Psalms 124:5) \"The defiant waters.\" They are from the side of impurity. \"From the surface of the earth\", they are above the earth, they are the destructive angels.",
            "What is written? \"But the dove found no rest\" (Genesis 8:9), because she was prevented from the upper world, and from the righteous ones above, and from all their blessings. This is what is written: \"And she returned to him to the ark, because the water was over the surface of all the earth”.",
            "\"He sent the dove out again\" (Genesis 8:10), and because of the pressure and pain, \"The dove came back to him in the evening\" (Genesis 8:11), when it was not a time of respite for them, as it was before, and her day became dark, and her sun was mixed.",
            "\"And what did you say to Noah and his sons? (Song of Songs 5:7) 'Found by the guards who circle the city.' Those are the guardians of the three watches of Jerusalem. Despite all of that, (Genesis 8:11) 'Behold, an olive leaf torn off, [was] in her mouth,' and because of this Noah knew that the waters had eased and the angels of sanctity prevailed over the angels of destruction. 'And he waited yet another seven days' etc., 'and she did not return again' etc., 'the waters had dried up from the earth.’\"",

And because of that, in these days (Yom Tov and Chol Hamoed) that they are the Tefillin of the Ruler of the World, it is forbidden to wear any other tefillin, because they are these (holiday) days, which they are the higher Tefillin (as in the holidays are an even higher tefillin) that rest on the heads of the Holy People of Israel.",

            "(205) [if the King offers the servant a specific seal, but instead of wearing the king's seal] If that servant, puts aside the higher seal the king made himself (aka, the holiday), in favor of a seal that the servant made himself, of course that servant deserves to be put to dead, because he desecrated the King’s Seal, and he didn’t care for the King’s honor. And because of that, it is forbidden for the Holy Nation (aka, the Jewish people) to disregard the higher Seal of the King [Yom Tov and Chol Hamoed] that he placed on them, in favor of this image (seal) that we created ourselves (Tefillin)."

The Angel of Death said to the Master of the World: 'Now You have given other creatures an opening [to avoid death].\" The Holy Blessed One replied: 'Eliyahu is not like other creatures. He could remove you [Death] from the world and you do not know his strength.' The Angel of Death said, 'Master of the World, grant me permission and I will descend upon him.' He said 'Go down.' And he immediately descended. But Eliyahu saw him, forced him under his leg, and [Eliyahu] asked to be able to remove him from the world, but God did not grant him permission. Immediately, Eliyahu flipped him and ascended [alive] to heaven.",
