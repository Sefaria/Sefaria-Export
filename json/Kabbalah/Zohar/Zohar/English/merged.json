                "Rabbi Hizkiyah opened, “It is written, as a rose among thorns.” (Song of Songs 2:2) What is the Rose? It is the Congregation of Israel. Because there is a rose, and there is a Rose. Just as the rose among the thorns is tinged with red and white, so is the Congregation of Israel affected by the qualities of Judgment and Mercy. Just as a rose has thirteen petals, the Assembly of Israel is surrounded on all sides by the thirteen attributes of Mercy. Thus, between the first mentions of the name Elohim, [in the Torah] these [thirteen] words surround and guard the Congregation of Israel.",
                "After this, [the name \"Elohim\"] is written again in the text. And why is it mentioned again? In order to bring out the five rigid leaves that surround a rose. And these five represent the five gates of salvation. And this secret is written about in the verse, \"I will raise the cup of salvation\" (Psalms 116:13) This is the cup of benediction which is raised after a meal. The cup of benediction must rest on five fingers, and no more, just as a rose rests on five rigid leaves. And this Rose is the cup of benediction. From the second to the third mention of the name Elohim [in the Torah], there are five words. From this point the Ohr [light] was created [hence \"Let there be Light.\"] and concealed and enclosed within that covenant that entered the rose and fructified it. This is referred to as a \"fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof.\" [Genesis 1:11] This seed is the Covenant.",
                "And just as the Covenant is sown by forty-two birthings from that same seed, so is the engraved and holy name sown, by the forty-two letters that describe the works of Creation."

            [
                "\"In the beginning,\" Rabbi Shimon opened, \"the flower buds appeared on the earth.\" (Song of Songs 2:12) “The flower buds” refer to the act of Creation. When had they \"appeared on the earth\"? On the third day, as it is said, “And the earth brought forth grass.” [Genesis 1:12] That was when they appeared on the earth. The time of \"pruning doves\" [Song of Songs 2:12] has come, alluding to the fourth day, when the \"pruning of the tyrants\" took place. [\"stars\" in Gen. 1:14 shares a spelling with \"curses\"] The voice of the turtle dove [Songs 2:14] refers to the fifth day, where it is written, “Let the waters swarm,” [Gen. 1:20] so as to produce offspring. “It is heard” [Songs 2:12] refers to the sixth day, where it is written, “Let us create man,” [Gen 1:26] and there it is said, “All that [the LORD] has spoken we will faithfully do.” [Exodus 24:7] \"Let us make man\" [Gen 1:26], who shall put action before listening. Because it says here, \"Let us make man,\" while there on Mount Sinai, when the LORD asked Israel about the Torah, they said \"we will faithfully do\". [Exodus 24:7]. \"In the land\" [Songs 2:12] refers to the day of Shabbat, which represents the Land of Life.",
                "Another explanation for \"buds\" - these are the Patriarchs who come to mind, and came into the World to Come, where they were hidden. They emerged from there secretly and hid themselves within the true prophets. Joseph was born, and they concealed themselves in him. When Joseph entered the Holy Land, he revealed their presence and then they appeared on the earth and were seen there. When are the Patriarchs seen? When the rainbow is seen in the sky. It is when the rainbow is seen that they are revealed. And at that moment, \"the time of pruning has come.\" This means that the time has come to eradicate the wicked from the world. Why were the wicked saved [until now]? Because the flower buds can be seen in the earth. And if they could not be seen, [the wicked] would not have remained in the world, and the world would not be able to exist.",
                "And who sustains the world, and causes the Patriarchs to appear? It is the voice of the children, who study the Torah. It is the voice of the children, who study the Torah. And since they grow in the world, the world is sustained. In deference to them, it is written, \"We will make you necklets of gold\" (Songs 1:11). This refers to the children that grow strong in the world, as is written, \"And you shall make two Cherubs of gold\" (Exodus 25:18)."

                "\"In the beginning,\" Rabbi Elazar opened, “Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things.” (Isaiah 40:26) Lift up your eyes, to what place? To the place where all eyes are turned. And who is He, that has \"created these things\"? He is one who opens those eyes. And you will know this. It is the concealed <i>Atika</i>,wherein lies the question, 'Who has created these?' And who is He? WHO. [M\"I] He is called from the ends of Divine Heaven on high, where everything belongs to Him as everything is in His domain. And since one can ask about Him though He is concealed and not revealed, He is called WHO, because beyond Him, one may not pose such questions. Thus, the end of heaven is called WHO.",
                "And there is another below, called WHAT [M\"H]. What is between 'WHO' [M\"I] and 'WHAT' [M\"H]? The first one, which is called WHO, is concealed. It remains a question: Once man has searched and inquired in order to understand and climb from one level to another, and has finally reached the end level of all, he is asked: WHAT? WHAT have you learned? WHAT have you seen? WHAT have you investigated, since everything is still concealed, just as it was before?",
                "Of this secret, it is written, “What can I take as witness or liken to you, O Fair Jerusalem? What can I match with you to console you, O Fair Maiden Zion?” (Lamentations 2:13) This is because, after the Temple was destroyed, a voice came forth and said, \"What shall I take to witness for you, and what shall I liken to you?\" This means that, using 'WHAT', I shall witness about you each and every day since the Ancient Days. As it is written: “I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day,” (Deuteronomy 30:19) which is what I liken to you. In the very same manner I crowned you with holy crowns and made you ruler over the world. As is written: \"Is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty?\" (Lamentations 2:15). I have called you, \"Jerusalem, built as a city that is compact together\" (Psalms 122:3). \"What shall I equal to you?\" (Lamentations 2:13). Just as your situation is here, so it is seemingly above! Just as now the holy nation does not enter below with the sacred arrangements, so I swear to you that I will not enter above, until your throngs come to you down below. This is your consolation - that I equate you with this level, in every respect. And now you are here, \"your breach is great like the sea\" [Lam. 2:13] And if you say that there is no existence or remedy for you, then, then who shall heal you? Namely, that same concealed supernal level WHO [M\"I] through which everything exists, shall heal and uphold you.",
                "WHO [M\"I] is the upper edge of Heaven and WHAT [M\"H] is the lower edge of Heaven. This was inherited by Jacob, as he \"shall reach from end to end\" (Exodus 26:28) — From the end above, which is WHO, down to the lower end, which is WHAT. Therefore, he stands in the middle, and \"WHO has created THESE [AL\"H]\""

                "Rabbi Shimon [who wrote the Zohar] said, “Elazar, my son, stop talking lest the supernal hidden secret, which humans know nothing about, be revealed. ” Rabbi Elazar was silent. Rabbi Shimon wept, and stood still for a moment. Rabbi Shimon then said, “Elazar, what is this 'THESE'? You say the stars and the signs of the zodiac, but have they not always been seen? And were they not created by WHAT [M\"H], as it is written, \"By the word of the LORD the heavens were made\"? (Psalms 33:6) And if 'THESE' denoted some hidden things, then there is no need to write 'THESE', because they [the planets are stars] are visible, and revealed!” This secret was never before revealed, until one day when I was on the seashore, Elijah came and asked me: Sir, do you know what \"Who has created these\" means? I answered, 'these' are the heavens and their hosts, the works of the Holy One, Blessed Be He. And man should look at them, and bless Him, as is written, \"When I behold Your heavens,",
                "Your fingers... Adonai our Master, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!\" [Psalms 8:4-10]",
                "He told me, Rabbi, the Holy One, blessed be He, had a great secret, which He revealed to the Celestial Assembly. The secret is that when the Most Concealed One desired to reveal Himself, He first made one Point, [Malkuth] and this point ascended and became a Thought. [Binah] He shaped in it all the images and engraved all the designs.",
                "He engraved inside a concealed, sacred candle an image of a concealed image of the holy of holies. A profound structure [the upper Sefiroth] emerged from the depth of that thought, and it is called WHO [M\"I], which is the inception of this edifice. And it exists, and exists not; it is hidden deep inside the name. [that is, the name 'Elohim'] It is not called [Elohim], but only M\"I – WHO [thus leaving the aleph, lamed, and hei of 'ELoHim'] He desired to reveal Himself and to be called this name [Elohim], so He clothed Himself in a precious, radiant garment [Chesed's light of Chassadim] and created THESE, and THESE ascended to the name [Elohim]. And these letters, Aleph, Lamed, and Hei, [together reading \"eleh\" which means \"this/these\"] after being joined together, ascended to the name [Elohim] the letters [Mem and Yudh, together reading \"mi\" which means \"who\"] combined with [Aleph, Lamed, and Hei] to complete the name Elohim. And until He created THIS, [THESE] Elohim did not ascend to form the name Elohim. Those who sinned in worshipping the Golden Calf used this secret by saying, \"This is your Elohim, Israel\" (Exodus 32:4).",
                "Just as the letters Mem-Yud joined the letters Aleph-Lamed-Hei, [to spell \"Elohim\"] the name has remained forever combined. And the continued existence of the world is based on this secret. Elijah then flew away, and I could not see him. And it is from him that I received this knowledge and was able to grasp this hidden secret. Rabbi Elazar came with all the other friends and bowed down before him. They wept and then said, if we had not come into this world but only to hear this secret, it would have been enough for us."
            ],
            [
                "Rabbi Shimon said, So accordingly, the heavens and their hosts were created by WHAT. As it is written: \"When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and stars that You set in place,\" (Psalms 8:4). [Before this] it is written, \"How majestic is Your name throughout the earth, You who have covered the heavens with Your splendor!\" (Psalms 8:2). The heavens were created by the name HOW [M\"H, \"how\" and \"what\" are spelled the same]. \"above the heavens\", which is called WHO [M\"I], that it amounts to the name of \"Elohim\". He created a light for His light. This means that He created the light of Chassadim as a precious garment for the light of Chochmah, that is in the name of WHO [M\"I] and they enclothed each other. Then [Malkuth] mounted to the Supernal Name [the 'supernal' \"Elohim\" which lies inside of Binah]. That is why the phrase, \"In the beginning Elohim created\", [refers to] the upper Elohim, [the one inside of Binah]. WHAT [M\"H, Malkuth], is not there and is not constructed.",
                "When the letters Aleph-Lamed-Hei are drawn from above, [from Binah], downward [to Malkuth], it is as if a Mother lends Her clothes to Her daughter and adorned her with Her own adornments. [Hence Binah is mother to her daughter Malkuth] And when does She properly adorn her? When all the males appear before her. It is written that \"all you males shall appear before the Master, the LORD\" (Exodus 34:23). Because [Malkuth] is called \"Master\" [a grammatically masculine term]. As it is written: \"Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Master of all the earth\" (Joshua 3:11). Then the letter Hei departs [from M\"H - WHAT], and is replaced by the letter Yud. [So it becomes M\"I - WHO] Then she dresses up in male clothes, [hence Malkuth is Binah's daughter, and yet the male Master]",
                "And the other letters, [Aleph, Lamed, and Hei] are drawn down by Israel from above, [Binah] down to this place; [Malkuth, since now it is called WHO/M\"I just as Binah is]. \"When I remember these\" (Ps. 42:5) when I utter these letters with my mouth and I shed tears voluntarily to draw down these letters, Aleph, Lamed, and Hei from Binah, and then I was \"leading them\" (Ps. 42), from above [Binah] \"to the house of Elohim\" (Ps. 42), [which is Malkuth] would be Elohim, just like [Binah]. And with what [shall I make them]? \"With the voice of joy and praise, a crowd keeping holiday\" (Ps. 42). Rabbi Elazar said, My silence has built the Temple on high [in Binah] and the Temple below, [in Malkuth]. And surely it is [a proverb], 'a word is worth one sela, and silence two' So the words 'a word is worth one sela' [are] what I have said and clarified, but the words 'silence two' — in my being silent, two worlds [Binah and Malkuth] were created and constructed together. [Since Malkuth's M\"H became Binah's M\"I]",
                "Rabbi Shimon said, from here onward we shall complete the text. As it is written, \"That brings out their host by number\" (Isaiah 40:26), there are two grades, and each one has to be recorded, one is called WHAT [M\"H] and the other WHO [M\"I]. WHO is the Upper One, and WHAT is the lower one. The Upper Degree registers, speaks, and brings forth their hosts by number, where the letter Hei alludes to the one that is known and unequaled, [i.e. WHO]. This is similar to the phrase, “haMotzi lechem” – \"He who brings forth bread from the earth,\" where the letter Hei refers to the knowledge of the known, lower degree, [i.e. WHAT]. And together they are one. [as Malkuth]. So, \"...by number,\" 600,000 that stand together and bring forth the hosts according to their types, which are innumerable.",
                "All of them, whether these 600,000 or all their hosts, shall be called by the name. What is meant by \"called by the name\"? (Deut. 28:10) If you say that He calls them by their names, it is not so. Because had it been so, He should have said, \"be [called] by His name.\" Rather, when this grade does not amount to the name [Elohim], but is called WHO [M\"I], it does not beget (any offspring) and does not bring forth those concealed inside it according to their kinds. Although all of them were hidden inside it, [they had not been clothed in the previously discussed 'precious, radiant garment'] Because He created, Aleph-Lamed-Hei, and they amount to His name, and Yud, and are called Elohim. Thus, by the power of this name He brought them forth in all perfection. And this is the meaning of the phrase, \"called by the name,\" by His own name did He call and bring forth each and every species to exist in perfection. The same appears here, \"See, I have called by name\" (Exodus 31:2), \"I have bestowed My name on Bezalel,\" so that Bezalel's existence reaches perfection.",
                "He asks: “What is the meaning of “by the greatness of His might and wealth?” (Isaiah 40:26) This is the supreme grade where all desires rise up in Him. And they ascend through a hidden and secret path... \"because He is strong in power\". This is the secret of the supernal world [WHO/M\"I] that rose up to the name Elohim. As we have stated, the phrase \"no one is missing\", is to the 600,000 that He brought forth by the power of this name. And because \"no one is missing\" [from the] 600,000, it follows that in every place that Israel died and were punished for their sins, they were numbered. And no one was ever missing from the 600,000, to keep the balance [between the worlds]. Just as no one was missing [from the] 600,000 above, no one was missing [from the 600,000] below."

It is said that, “When the Creator thought to create the world, all of the letters were still concealed, and even 2,000 years before the creation of the world, the Creator gazed into the letters and played with them.",
                "When the Creator thought to create the world, all the letters of the alphabet came to Him in reverse order from last to first. The letter <b>Tav</b> entered first and said, “Master of the world! It is good, and also seemly of You, to create the world with me, with my properties. For I am the seal on Your ring, called Truth, that ends with the letter Tav. And that is why You are called Truth, and why it would befit the King to begin the universe with the letter Tav, and to create the world by her, by her properties. The Creator answered: \"You are beautiful and sincere, but do not merit the world that I conceived to be created by your properties. You are destined to serve as a mark on the foreheads of the faithful, who have kept the Law of the Torah from Aleph to Tav. When you appear, they shall die. Not only that, but you are also the seal of the word Death, and because of this, you are not suitable for Me to create the world with you.\" The letter Tav then immediately left.",

He replies: You are worthy, you are good, and you are truthful. But because you are included among the letters that form the word Falsehood, [<i>sheqer</i>] I do not wish to create the world with you. Falsehood would not have prevailed had you not been attached to the letters [Resh and Quf].",
                "From this, whoever wants to tell a lie, should add that lie to a base that is truthful. Because the letter Shin is a letter of truth, meaning a letter of Truth by which the Patriarchs reached unison. [Shin's three arms represent Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob — Chesed, Gevurah, and Tiferet] And the letters <b>Quf</b> and <b>Resh</b> appear on the evil side, [Quf+Resh spells <i>qar</i>, \"cold\"] In order for them to continue to exist, they pulled the letter Shin to them, creating the combination <i>qesher</i>, [\"connection\"] When the Shin realized this, it left.",

You, who is called a Tzadik, are also recorded within me, for You are righteous and You love righteousness. Therefore, my properties are suitable to create the world by.” The Creator answered: “Tsade, you are truly righteous, but you must remain concealed and not be revealed to the extent required were the world to be created by you, so as to not give the world an excuse.” The concealment of the letter Tsade is necessary, for first came the letter Nun, which was then joined by the letter Yod from the Creator’s Holy Name who stood above it as a mark of the bond between the Creator and His creations, mounted the letter Nun and joined it on its right hand side, thereby creating the letter Tsade.",

That is, liberation is deliverance from all suffering. And it is therefore fitting to create the world with me. The Creator answered her: “Though you are fine, the word begins with you and is secretly denoted by you, like a serpent that strikes and hides its head in its body. So a sinner bows his head, hiding from others’ eyes, but stretches out his hands to sin. So is the shape of the letter Peh, whose head is hidden inside it.” And the Creator also said to the letter Ayin that it would be unfitting to create the world with its properties, for within it is the property of <i>Avon</i>.

Because only the supernal six days, [have bearing] on the Torah, [Zeir Anpin] and no more. While the others are concealed.",
                "But we have already seen in the hidden mysteries of <i>Beresheet</i>, where he says that He who is holy and concealed engraved a certain form in His bowels — the Secret One, that is designated by a thrusting point. This engraving was incised and hidden in it, as someone who hides everything, locks it up, and puts the key away. This key is kept hidden in a certain chamber and although everything is hidden in that chamber, the most important thing is that key, which locks and unlocks everything!",
                "That chamber has a lot of hidden treasures one upon the other. In that chamber there are fifty gates, which are supposed to be closed. There are forty-nine gates engraved upon the 'four directions' of the world. One gate has no direction; it is not known whether it faces up or down. This is how this gate stays closed.",

And no one is to know about [the keyhole] without having the key. And upon this secret: \"In the beginning, Elohim created\" (Gen. 1:1). <i>Beresheet</i> is the key by which everything is hidden, as it locks and unlocks. With this key, six gates are locked and unlocked. So, when it locks those gates, and includes them within itself, then it is for sure <i>Beresheet</i>: a revealed word that includes within it a concealed word. <i>Bara</i>, wherever it appears, is a word that hides and guards a secret, locks it up and does not unlock it."

I heard the same from the Holy Luminary, [Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai], that the word <i>bara</i> is concealed in order to show [that the key] locks up and does not unlock. As long as [the key] locked up the word <i>bara</i>, the world could not exist and would not have lasted at all! Complete chaos would have prevailed, covering the whole of existence. And when this chaos prevailed there would not have been a world; it would have never lasted!",
                "When did this key unlock the gates, and serve and produce offspring? When Abraham appeared, [as Abraham is identified with Chesed] As it is written: \"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were <i>created</i>\" (Gen. 2:4). And we have already learned, [not to pronounce \"created\" as it is written, <i>behibar'am</i>, but instead as <i>b'Abraham</i>, which means \"with Abraham\"] Then, the letters that were entirely concealed in the word <i>bara</i> [were opened] to hear. And the Pillar of Pro<i>creation</i>, the sacred limb [<i>evar</i>] of Yesod, upon which the world is established was revealed. [in Hebrew, the words for \"create\" and \"limb\" are spelled with the same letters - <i>bara</i> vs. <i>evar</i>, Bet-Aleph-Resh vs Aleph-Bet-Resh]",
                "When <i>evar</i> left its impression on the word <i>bara</i>, then the supernal and concealed One formed another impression for His Name and Glory, which is WHO [M\"I] and THESE [<i>eleh</i>, Aleph-Lamed-Hei]. So was the Holy and Blessed Name, which is WHAT [M\"H], formed as a mark. It brought forth <i>evar</i> from <i>bara</i>. And it has the imprint of THESE from one side, and <i>evar</i> from the other side. Therefore, in the Sacred Concealed One, THESE exists, as does <i>evar</i>. And when one of them reaches perfection, so does the other. Thus, He engraved upon <i>evar</i> the letter Hei, and it engraved upon the Aleph, Lamed, and Hei, [THESE] the letter Yud!",
                "The letters [Aleph-Bet-Resh + Hei, and Aleph-Lamed-Hei + Yud] were roused to complete both sides, He then brought forth the final letter Mem. He took one final Mem to one side [to Aleph-Lamed-Hei + Yud] and one final Mem to the other side, that is to the letters [Aleph-Bet-Resh + Hei], thus completing the holy name to form Elohim [Aleph-Lamed-Hei + Yud + Mem, ELoHIM] In the same manner, the name Abraham was completed. [Aleph-Bet-Resh + Hei + Mem, ABRaHaM] \"When one of them reaches perfection, so does the other.\" And some say that the Holy One, blessed be He, took the letters Mem-Yud [WHO] and put them together with Aleph-Lamed-Hei [THESE] and Elohim [Aleph-Lamed-Hei-Yud-Mem] was formed; and He took Mem-Hei [WHAT] and put them together with Aleph-Bet-Resh [<i>evar</i>], and it became Abraham. And the word WHO [Mem-Yud, M\"I] alludes to the fifty gates of Binah, and in M\"I, there is a Yud, which is the first letter of the Holy Name. And the word WHAT [Mem-Gei, M\"H] alludes to the numerical value of the Holy Name, and it has within it the second letter of the Holy Name YHWH. As it is written, \"happy are the people for whom this is so...\" (Ps. 144:15) and \"and hangs the earth upon <i>nothing</i>\" (Job 26:7). And then both worlds were upheld, the World to Come with the letter Yud and this world with Hei. That is, He created the World to Come with WHO [M\"I], and this world with WHAT [M\"H]. This is a hint for the higher and lower. And then He created offspring and the name was complete. As it is written: \"These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were <i>created</i>\" (Gen 2:4). [The generations] were suspended, until the name of Abraham was created. [see last chapter's equation of <i>behibar'am</i> with <i>b'Abraham</i>] When the name of Abraham was completed, so was the Holy Name completed. And this is what is written, \"in the day that YHWH Elohim made the earth and the heaven\" [so, by reading <i>behibar'am</i> \"created\" as <i>b'Abraham</i> \"with Abraham\", the first time the Holy Name is seen in Torah is alongside the first mention of Abraham]"

And the Holy One, blessed be He, receives this matter and kisses it. He also adorns it with seventy graven and inscribed crowns. And this new word of wisdom that is revealed is then set upon the head of the Righteous who lives forever. Then it flies off and floats through 70,000 worlds until it reaches Atik Yomin.

Afterward, they leave there to float around before they are presented in full perfection to Atik Yomin. At this stage, Atik Yomin smells the odor of the matter, and He finds it most desirable. He then takes it and crowns it with 370,000 crowns. And the phrase flies on high - going up and down before landing. Thus, a heaven is made. And from every matter of wisdom, many heavens are made. They stand in full perfection in front of Atik Yomin, who calls them 'New Heavens'. 'Renewed Heavens' — concealed by the hidden secrets of the sublime wisdom. While all the other phrases and sayings of the Torah that are newly revealed stand before the Holy One, blessed be He, these words of wisdom ascend and become the lands of the living.

The fourth time He addressed them. Eventually, He used the Torah to teach people how not to be misled and to misunderstand it.

Therefore, it is written, \"And on the seventh day Elohim completed His work which He had done\" (Gen 2:2). This refers to the Shabbat and the fourth leg of the throne.",
                "And if you ask, If it is so, [that Shabbat is equatable with the fourth leg of the throne, Malkuth], then why does [Lev. 19:30] say, \"You shall keep My Sabbaths,\" plural? [Because,] the evening of Shabbat, the day of Shabbat, [which is Zeir Anpin, as daytime shines on Earth and he shines on Malkuth] are in unison as one.

[from Abba v'Ima/AV\"I, \"Father and Mother\", a.k.a Chokhmah and Binah] He said to him, If that is so, then you have made the Shabbat without any sanctity! Sanctity prevails only when it comes from above! [from AV\"I] Rabbi Aba answered: It is indeed so, as it is written, \"And call the Shabbat a delight, the <i>holy day</i> of the LORD honorable\" (Is. 58:13). So the Shabbat is mentioned separately, as is the holiness of haShem. He then asked him: What then is the \"holiness of haShem?\" Rabbi Aba replied: This is the holiness that descends from above, and rests upon [Shabbat]. He said, If holiness, which descends from above, is called \"honorable,\" it may seem as though the Shabbat itself is not \"honorable.\" Yet it is written, \"and shall honor it\" But Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Aba, \"Let this man speak, because he has something wise to say, something of which we know nothing.\" They said to him, \"Say what you want to say!\"",

For this reason, the verse which added <i>et</i> with \"My <i>Sabbaths</i>\" refers to both the higher Shabbat and the lower Shabbat, which are joined as one and are both concealed.",
                "Another Shabbat, however, remained unmentioned and felt humiliated. She ['shabbat' is a feminine word] came forward and said, \"Master of the Universe, from the day You created me until now, I am called '<i>the</i> Shabbat,' and there is no day [left for me] without a night!\" [as Hebrew days start at sundown, not midnight] He told her: My daughter, you <i>are</i> the Shabbat and I have called you 'the Shabbat,' but now I am adorning you with a more glorious crown. He then sent forth a proclamation stating, \"And you shall revere My sanctuary\" (Lev. 19:30). And this is the Shabbat of the eve of Shabbat, which is awe, where awe prevails. But who is this Shabbat? The Donkey Driver [replies]: This is the one that the Holy One, blessed be He, included [with the other], saying: \"I am the Lord\" (Ibid.). And I heard this from my father, who emphasized [that the word] <i>et</i> symbolizes the Shabbat limits. \"My <i>Sabbaths</i>\", denotes a circle and with a square within, which are two [different shapes that, yet, are now one]. According to these two, there are two hallowed prayers that we should recite. One starts with <i>Vaychulu</i> [Beresheet 2:1-3], and the other is the <i>Kiddush</i>. The passage of <i>Vaychulu</i> consists of 35 words, and in the Kiddush that we perform there are also 35 words. They add up to seventy names, with which the Holy One, blessed be He, and the Congregation of Israel adorn themselves.",
                "And because this circle and this square are \"My Sabbaths\", they are both included in [what we must] keep, as it is written, \"You shall keep [My Sabbaths]\" But the upper Shabbat is not included in [what we must] 'Keep', but only in [what we must] 'Remember', [as in \"Remember the Sabbath day\", Exodus 20:8] because the supernal King, [Binah] is completed by \"Remember\". And this is why, [Binah] is called the \"King to whom Peace belongs.\" [Melchizedek] As His Peace is 'Remember'. And so there is no controversy above.",
                "The Donkey Driver said, There are two kinds of peace down below: One is Jacob, [Tiferet] the other is Joseph, [Yesod] And because of this, Peace is written twice in [the verse] \"Peace, Peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near\" (Is. 57:19). \"To him that is far\" refers to Jacob; \"to him that is near\" refers to Joseph. So \"to him that is far\" means, as you say, \"The LORD has appeared to me from afar\" (Jeremiah 31:2), and also, \"And his sister stood afar off\" (Ex. 2:4). And \"to him that is near\" means, as you say, \"to new [Elohim] that came from nearby\" (Deut. 32:17).“You are to guard.” “You shall fear My sanctity” refers to the point standing in the center, which must be feared more than anything, for its punishment is death.",
                "\"From afar\" (Jer. 31:2), refers to the upper Point in His Palace. And the verse refers to it with the words, \"You shall keep\" (Lev. 19:30), where it is included [in what we must] 'Keep'. \"And reverence My sanctuary\" refers to the Point in the center that should be most greatly awed, since the penalty for transgressing it is death. For it is written, \"Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death\" (Ex. 31:14). And who \"profanes it?\" Those who penetrate into the space of the circle and the square - into the spot where that Point is situated - and damage it. They \"shall surely be put to death!\" This is why it is written, \"and reverence.\" And this Point is called \"I\" [<i>ani</i>] where the Most High and Concealed One, <i>HaVaYaH</i>, prevails. Thus, \"I am the LORD\" (Lev. 19:30), all is One. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba dismounted, and kissed him. They said, \"With all this wisdom in your possession you are leading donkeys behind us?!\" They asked him: 'who are you?' He answered them, 'Do not ask me who I am, but let us, me and you, walk along and deal in the Torah. Let each of us speak words of wisdom to illuminate the way.",
                "They said to him: \"Who has put you here to be a donkey driver?\" He replies: The letter Yud waged war against the two letters, Kaph and Samekh, [to come and] join me. The letter Kaph did not want to leave and join me because it can only be at rest in [the Throne of Glory], and the Samekh did not want to leave, because it has to support those who fall. And without the Samech, they cannot survive!",
                "He continued: The letter Yud alone came over to me by itself, kissed me, embraced me, and wept together with me. It said to me, My son, what shall I do with you? I am leaving you to load myself with a plenitude of good things and of precious, sublime and secretive letters. And then I shall return to you and help you. I shall bring you the possessions of two letters that are much higher than those that have left you. These are <i>substance</i> [<i>yesh</i>, spelled Yud+Shin], the superior Yud together with the superior Shin. [They] shall become your treasure, full of all riches. So for this purpose, my son, go and drive the donkeys. And this is why I am still doing so!",
                "Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Aba rejoiced. They also wept and said to him, \"Come, <i>you</i> shall ride on the donkey and <i>we</i> shall walk along behind you\". He said to them, \"have I not told you that it is the command of the King, until the donkey driver [the Messiah, cf. Zechariah 9:9] appears!?\" They said to him, \"Until now you have not given us your name. And where do you live?\" He told them, \"Where I live is a good place and very precious to me. It is a tower - a very highly exalted tower - that floats on air. And those who live in this tower are the Holy One, blessed be He, and one poor man! But I have been exiled from there, and came to drive the donkeys.\" Rabbi Aba and Rabbi Elazar looked at him, and his words tasted as sweet as the manna and honey to them. They said to him, \"If you tell us the name of your father, we will kiss the earth under your feet!\" He responded, \"Why? What for? It is not my habit to take pride in the study of the Torah.\"",
                "He continued, \"but the place where my father lives is in the Great Sea. [The Mediterranean] And he was a fish that swam from one end of the Great Sea to the other. And he was mighty and noble, a venerable figure who became wise with his years, and was able to swallow up all the other fish in the sea. Then later, he released them, full of life, and all the good of the world. And with his might, he was able to cross over the entire Sea in an instant. And he released me, like an arrow in the hand of a valiant man, and hid me in that place that I told you about while he returned to his home and disappeared in the Ocean.\"",
                "Rabbi Elazar examined his words and then said to him: \"You are the son of the Holy Luminary! You are the son of the venerable Rav Hamnuna Sabba! You are the son of the Light of the Torah! And you drive our donkeys for us!\" They both wept and kissed him, then continued their journey. They asked him: \"May it please our lord to tell us his name?\"",
                "He began with the verse, \"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada\" (II Samuel 23:20). This verse has been explained, and explained well! But it came to show us the sublime secrets of the Torah. \"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada\" has been mentioned [as referring to] the secret of wisdom. It is a clue to something deep and concealed, and the name caused it. \"a brave soldier who performed great deeds\" applies to the Righteous, with life of the worlds. \"Mighty of deeds\" means that he is the Master of all actions and of all the hosts on high, because they all come from him. He [God] is \"haShem Tzeva'ot\" [because he is] the sign throughout His hosts and is distinguished as he stands high above them all.",
                "\"Mighty of deeds\", \"of Kabzeel\" [ibid.] So where did this great and precious tree, which is greater than all, come from? From which grade? The verse repeatedly states, \"of Kabzeel,\" which is a high and concealed grade that \"neither has the eye seen...\" (Is. 64:3). It includes everything, and it gathers everything it receives from the supernal light, and from it everything goes forth. It includes everything, and it gathers everything it receives from the supernal light, and from it everything goes forth.",

                "\"He slew two lion-hearted men of Moab\" (II Samuel 23:20). Two Temples existed and were sustained on his account: The first Temple and the second. However, as he was gone, the flow from above stopped. It is as if he \"slew,\" destroyed, and ended them. And the holy throne collapsed. As it is written, \"As I was in exile\" (Ezekiel 1:1). (Meaning) that a certain grade, which is called I (Heb. אֲנִי, Aleph-Nun-Yud) was in exile. Where? \"By the river Kevar\" (Ibid.) By the river that had sprouted and flowed from Kevar (already), or in other words, by the river that had already sprouted and flowed, all its waters and fountains have dried up, (and) does not flow as before.",
                "Therefore it is written, \"and the river is parched, and dries up\" (Job 14:11). It \"is parched\" at the first Temple and \"dries up\" at the second. For this reason, \"He slew two lion-hearted men of Moab.\" Moab (is) מֵאָב דְּבִשְׁמַיָא, or from our Father in Heaven. And both Temples were destroyed because of Him, as all the lights that shone upon Yisrael were now darkened.",
                "Further, \"He went down and slew the lion\" (II Samuel 23:20). In early days, when this river's waters flowed downward, Yisrael were in a state of perfection, because they offered their offerings and sacrifices to atone for their sins and purify their souls. Then, from above, the image of a lion descended. They saw it on the altar, as it crouched on its prey, consuming it like a mighty man. And all the dogs hid from it and did not come out.",
                "The sins caused him to go down to the lower levels and slay the lion. The lion refused to give up its prey as before, (as if) he killed it! Assuredly, \"He slew the lion.\" \"In the midst of a pit\"(Ibid.) in front of the eyes of the Other Evil Side. And because the Other Side saw this, it gained courage and sent a dog to eat the offerings. And what is the name of that lion? Oriel, אוֹרִיאֵ''ל, as he had the face of a lion. And what is the name of that dog? Baladan, בְּלַאדָן is its name, because Baladan is formed by the same letters as the words Bal (not) and Adam (Man), with the final Mem exchanged for Nun. And it is not a human being, but a dog with the face of a dog.",
                "\"In a day of snow\" (II Shmuel 23:20) (is) the day when the sins caused the sentence to be pronounced by the Court on high. Therefore, it is written, \"She is not afraid of the snow\" (Prov. 31:21), which symbolizes the judgment on high. Because \"all her household are clothed with scarlet\" (Ibid.). She can endure the strong fire. Up to this point, the secret of the verse is not revealed.",
                "What is written next? \"And he slew the Egyptian, a man of good appearance\" (II Samuel 23:21). Here the secret of the verse is revealed to let us know that every time Yisrael sinned, he went away and prevented them from receiving all the blessings and all the lights that shone upon them. \"He slew the Egyptian.\" This is the light, the same Light that shone upon Yisrael. And who is he? Moses. As he is described in the verse, \"And they said an Egyptian man delivered us\" (Ex. 2:19). Because he was born and grew up (in Egypt) until he rose to reach the Supernal Light.",

This is the husband of that \"appearance,\" the glory of Hashem (i.e. Malchut). Because he earned the right to lead this grade over the land, as he wished, a feat that no other man had achieved.",
                "\"And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand\" (2 II Samuel 23:21). This refers to the rod of Elohim that was delivered into his hand. As it is written, \"With the rod of Hashem in my hand\" (Ex. 17:9). And this is the same rod that was created at the twilight of Shabbat eve and was engraved with the Holy Name by a holy shaping. And with this rod Moses committed the sin of smiting the rock, as is written, \"And he smote the rock with his rod twice\" (Num. 20:11). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: \"Moses, I have not given you My rod for this purpose; by your life, from henceforward, it will not be in your hands any more.\"",

Even though he did not join them and was not included in the count, \"David set him over his guard\" (Ibid.) because he was never separated from the tablet of his heart, because they are inseparable. David gave his heart to him, but he did not (do the same) to David. Because by the hymns and praises together with the kindness that the moon shows for the sun, she draws him (the sun) to reside with her.

So they sat down, began to weep, and could not speak to each other. After a while, Rabbi Abba said, This must be related to what we have learned. When righteous people go on a journey and occupy themselves in the study of the Torah, they are visited by righteous souls from that other world. So this surely must (be why) Rav Hamnuna Saba came to us from that world - to reveal these teachings to us. And before we were able to recognize who he was, he went off and disappeared.They stood up and tried to lead their donkeys on, but the donkeys did not move. They tried to lead them on, but still they did not move. Fear struck them both, and they left the donkeys in their place. And even now, that site is called the \"place of the donkeys.\"",
                "Rabbi Elazar said, \"O, how great is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who fear You\" (Ps. 31:20). How great is the heavenly abundance that the Holy One, blessed be He, shall bestow on human beings; to those sin-fearing, divine, and righteous men who learn the Torah as they arrive at the World to Come. It is not only written, \"Your goodness,\" but also \"how great is Your goodness.\" And who is He? \"The memory of Your goodness\" (Ps. 145:7), which is the pleasure of life that is drawn from the World to Come down to the life of the Worlds. This is\"the memory of your goodness,\" which is certainly \"the great goodness toward the house of Yisrael\" (Isaiah 63:7).",

It is the place where all the secrets are included, the word how (מָה) (means) according to what we have learned. \"Great\" refers to a great and strong tree (Zeir Anpin). Because there is another tree, which is smaller than this one (Malchut), this one is referred to as great and rises up to the highest of the heavens. \"Your Goodness\" is the light that was created on the first day; \"which You have laid up for those who fear You.\" He hid it for the righteous in the World to Come.",

This is the lower Garden of Eden, where all the righteous stand in the spirit, which is clothed in a precious garment, in the same way and form that they appeared in this world. Thus, the phrase \"in the sight of the sons of men\" means in the same form as human beings that live in this world. And they stand there and then rise up in the air, ascending to the celestial Academy in the upper Garden of Eden. They float around and bathe in the dew of the rivers of pure balsam.

They were frightened and (stayed) standing in their places. Then they sat down.

So certainly, the Holy One, blessed be He, was on this path. Furthermore, I see that your faces have changed. Rabbi Yosi said, You have said well, that a sage is preferable to a prophet.

Because, as it is written, \"About this time in the coming year you shall embrace (Heb. חוֹבֶקֶת) a son\" (II Kings 4:16). So Habakkuk was the son of the Shunammite. And there were two embraces: one from his mother and one from Elisha, as it is written, \"and he put his mouth upon his mouth\" (Ibid. 34).",

And he called him Habakkuk, a name that completes all the sides, because it completes two embraces, as mentioned previously. It also completes the secret of the 216 letters of the Holy Name. (Habakuk = 216 in Gematria) By 72 names he revived him and brought his spirit back. And by 216 letters, he revived his body and bodily functions. This is why he is called Habakkuk.",

He started to ask for mercy on his soul by saying, \"Hashem, revive Your work\" in making me; \"in the midst of the years\" (Habakuk 3:2), let his life be \"revive\" his life. And whoever is connected to those primordial years has life connected to him.

She (Malchut) is the beginning or the first stage that opens the entrance to the level of the supernal Chochmah (Wisdom).

So what happened with Batsheva occurred on the fifteenth day of Elul. While on Yom Kipur, he received the message \"Hashem also has put away your sin; you shall not die\" (II Samuel 12:13). What is the meaning of \"you shall not die?\" It means that he shall not die at the hand of Dumah.",
                "Dumah said, Master of the universe, I have one thing against him! He opened his mouth and said, \"as Hashem lives, the man that has done this deserves to die\" (Ibid. 5). So he has condemned himself to death, and therefore I have the power over him. He said to Dumah, You have no permission, because he has already confessed in front of Me saying, 'I have sinned against Hashem' even though he did not sin. Although his sin against Uriah was (by killing him), I have written his punishment and he has accepted it! Immediately Dumah returned to his place, disappointed.",
                "Concerning this David said, \"Unless Hashem had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence (Heb. דּוּמָה)\" (Ps. 94:17). \"Unless Hashem had been my help\" that had He not become David's keeper and guarded him David's \"soul had almost dwelt with Dumah.\" Why does he say \"had almost?\" Because only the smallest distance, as narrow as a thin thread separated him from the Other Side. So \"almost dwelt with Dumah.\" Was just the distance of a thin thread away.",
                "Therefore, every person should be careful not to say what King David said, because he will not be able to say to Dumah, \"it was an error\" (Eccl. 5:5), as it was with David. Because in David's case, the Holy One, blessed be He, defeated (Dumah) in the case. \"Wherefore should Elohim be angry at your voice\" (Ibid.) refers to the voice that said, \"and destroy the work of your hands\" (Ibid.). This is the sacred flesh, the holy covenant that he damaged, and because of which he is to be dragged down to Gehenom by the angel Dumah.",

These are the friends who have joined the Bride, (i.e. Malchut, by studying on Erev Shavuot), together with those who are the custodians of the sign of Her covenant. The firmament shows and registers each and every one of them. What is the firmament? It is where the sun, moon, stars and constellations are located, and it is the Book of Remembrance. It announces, registers, and inscribes them, so that they can be the residents of its own palace, and it can always fulfill their desires.",
                "\"Day to day utters speech\" (Ibid. 3) is an allusion to the sacred day that belongs to those supernal days of the King, that praise the friends. And they say to each other the same words that are written, \"Day to day utters\" that same \"speech,\" thereby praising Him. The words \"and night to night\" refer to the levels that govern the night. They praise one another with the knowledge that each (receives) from its friends. And by this state of harmony and perfection, they become their friends and beloved ones.",
                "\"There is no speech nor language\" (Ibid. 4). (This is) the speech and language that belong to worldly matters that are not heard before the Holy King, and that he is not interested in hearing them. But the words, \"Their line is gone out through all the earth\" (Ibid. 5), 1. that these words draw a line between the inhabitants of above and the inhabitants of below. From them, Firmaments are formed, and from them and from that praise, the earth is molded. And if you should say that these words wander around the world in one place, \"and their words to the end of the world\" (Ibid.).",
                "Because Firmaments are formed by them, who resides there? He repeated, \"In them He set a tent for the sun\" (Ibid.). That holy sun, (referring to Zeir Anpin), has made his habitation and above in them and crowned himself with them.",

He is happy and runs along these Firmaments. Then, he leaves them and enters into another tower at a different place; this tower comes \"from the end of the heaven\" (Ibid. 7). It certainly comes from the supernal world, which is the upper \"end of the heaven\", \"and his circuit:\"what is his circuit? It is the \"lower end of the heaven\" (i.e. Malchut). This is the circuit of the year that revolves around all the \"ends.\" It is attached to the heavens and extends from there to this firmament. \"And there is nothing hid from His heat\" (Ibid.) means there is nothing hid from His heat, from that circuit, or from the circuit of the sun that revolves in all directions.",
                "\"And there is nothing hidden from His heat (or anger)\" means that there is no one from all the supernal levels who can hide from Him; everything revolves and comes to Him - each and everything. Nothing can be hidden from Him. \"From His heat\", He heats up and returns the instant they have reached full repentance. All this praise and all this glorification is the result of their study of the Torah, as it is written, \"The Torah of Hashem is perfect\" (Ibid. 8). Hashem is mentioned here six times; there are also six verses from \"The heavens declare\" until \"The Torah of Hashem is perfect\" (Ps. 19: 2-8).",

The other verses (Ps. 19:8-11) are notable only for the six times that Hashem appears in them. However, the six verses (Ps. 19:2-8) are equated with the six letters (in בְּרֵאשִׁית), while the six Names are equated with the six words (the next six words in the verse).",

This person, therefore, is always afraid of Him. But we can see that the fear he has of the Holy One, blessed be He, has no actual source (is not really genuine).

                "The words: \"And...said\" should be studied and questioned. The term \"And...said (Heb. וַיֹּאמֶר)\" consists of the Hebrew letters of Mi (Eng. 'who') and Or (Eng. 'light'), which is an inquiry. \"And...said\" alludes to a raised force, and the raising is done in silence. A light is drawn from the secret of the Endless Light; from the beginning of thought. \"And Elohim said\" means that now the chamber gave birth to a holy seed, with which it was pregnant, in secret. And he who was born, namely the Male and Female principles, was heard without. Whoever gave birth to him, to the Male and Female principles, did it secretly and was not heard at all. This refers to giving birth to the Mochin of the Male and Female principles while still in Binah. But as soon as he emerged from there, from Binah, a sound was heard without.",
                "\"Let there be (Heb. יְהִי) light,\" means that everything that comes forth and emanates in the world proceeds according to the secret of the words: \"Let there be light.\" יְהִי alludes to the secret of Aba and Ima, which are Yud-Hei of יְהִי (Yud-Hei-Yud). The letter Yud alludes to Aba and the Hei to Ima. Afterward, the letters Yud- Hei return to the first point by adding another point, namely Yud, just like the first one as it is written: יְהִי (Yud-Hei-Yud) to institute a beginning for an expansion of something else.",
                "The terms \"light\" and \"Let there be light,\" do not refer to the renewal of the light, but rather to the returning of the light that Aba and Ima already had. The expansion of this light that appears in the verse: \"Let there be light (Heb. אוֹר, Aleph-Vav -Resh)\" is a most hidden secret, because it was the expansion that split according to the secret of the concealment of the supernal and concealed air (Heb. אֲוִיר). The word אֲוִיר consists of the letters Aleph-Vav -Yud-Resh and is Arich Anpin. It was split in such a way that there is nothing really renewed in the name Yud Hei Vav Hei. Rather, the perfection that was there before the splitting is now revealed. It first split and produced one concealed point from within its own mystery. It revealed the point Yud. As a result of this removal of the Yud from Avir, what is left of the original word אֲוִיר is Or, which is from the secret of the concealed air.",
                "When the first point, which is Yud, proceeded from Arich Anpin, its light shone upon it according to the sense of 'reaching yet not reaching'. Once the point expanded, the light was revealed, and this is the secret of the Or (light) that has remained from Avir (air). This refers to the light that has existed at first in Binah, when it was in the head of Arich Anpin. It then disappeared when it came out of the head. Now it has returned to it and remains there. The light has gone; it has disappeared and is now hidden. And one point remains in Binah, where the light of Chochmah always reaches in a hidden manner. The \"reaching yet not reaching\" shines in the manner of the first point that has emerged from it. As a result, they are all linked to one another and illuminate one another.",
                "When it ascends to the head of Arich Anpin, they all rise up and cling to it. Then it is as if \"reaching.\" It is treasured in the place of the Endless Light, which is Arich Anpin, and everything becomes one. The point that was in the light, and transformed it into air, is now completely light. It expanded, and from this expansion illuminated the seven letters of the alphabet, which were not yet solid but were still moist. Later darkness came forth and seven other letters of the alphabet came out. The firmament then came forth and stopped the dispute between the two sides. In it there issued eight other letters, which added up to 22 in all. Seven letters from the right side and seven letters from the left side jumped on the firmament and were all engraved on it, where they remained moist. As the firmament congealed, so did the letters. They were engraved and assumed their intended shapes. And there the Torah was inscribed, referring to Zeir Anpin which is called the Torah, to shine outward on the lower beings.",
                "The phrase: \"Let there be light\" alludes to the name great El, according to the secret of he who issues from the primal air. Hence, it is written: \"Let there be (Heb. yehi),\" implying the Sefirah of Chesed of Zeir Anpin called 'great El.' The phrase: \"And there was (Heb. וַיְהִי)\" refers to the secret of the darkness that is called 'Elohim.' And it is called 'light' after the left was combined with the right because the name Elohim extends from the secret of the name El, which is Chesed. Thus, the name Elohim is the aspect of Chesed as well. And the right was included within the left, and the left within the right.",
                "The verse: \"And Elohim saw the light, that it was good\" (Genesis 1:4) implies the central pillar of Zeir Anpin, which is the Sefirah of Tiferet in it. The phrase: \"That it was good\" said about Tiferet means that it shone up and down in all directions, namely to all the Sefirot: Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malchut. Tiferet of Zeir Anpin is the secret of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, which includes all directions, right and left, front and back, up and down. The words, \"And Elohim divided the light\" mean that he prevented the dispute between right and left, so that everything may be perfect.",
                "\"And Elohim called...\", etc. (Genesis 1:5). He asks: What is the meaning of \"And Elohim called the light day\"? He replies, This means that he called and invited it to bring forth from within that perfect light that stands in the middle, referring to Tiferet, one light. And this light is the foundation of the world, upon which all worlds are erected and from where all the souls are born. From this perfected light emerges the central pillar, the foundation of the life of the worlds, this being the day from the right side. The words: \"And the darkness he called night\" mean that He called and invited it, bringing forth one female from within the left side, the secret of darkness. This female principle is the secret of the moon that governs at night. For this reason, it is called night. And this is the secret of the name \"Adonai\" and the name \"the Master of all the earth\" (Joshua 3:11). The right enters into that perfected pillar in the middle, where it is included with the secret of the left; namely, Chesed of Zeir Anpin, which also includes",
                "His Gvurah and enters His Central Column, which is Tiferet. Then Zeir Anpin rises up to the primal point, which is Arich Anpin, and takes and possesses there, in Arich Anpin, Mochin, which are a thing based on the secret of the three vowels Cholam, Shuruk and Chirik which are called holy seed. For no seed can be sown for the purpose of the Mochin except according to this secret. All, referring to the illumination of the three vowels, were united in the central pillar, which is Tiferet, and it emanated the foundation (Yesod) of the world. Because of this, Yesod is called all, because it holds on to all, namely the illumination of all three Columns by the light of passion. In other words, because of the desire of the Left for the light of the Right, Yesod reconciles the Left with the Right and unites them. And because the Central Column acquires them, that Column attains both of them and bestows them both on Yesod.",
                "The left is set ablaze by the force of might, and smells. It smelled throughout the grades, and from the glow of this fire it emanates the Female principle called moon. This blazing is considered to be darkness, because it extends from darkness. And these two sides, the right and the left, produce these two grades, one male and one female,",
                "because Yesod, which is male, emanated from the rule of the Right of Zeir Anpin. The Female principle emanates from the Left Column of Zeir Anpin. Yesod holds on to the central pillar and receives the additional light that was in it. This refers to the light of Chochmah, which is an additional light for Zeir Anpin. The central pillar, Zeir Anpin, is entirely complete by Chochmah and by Chassadim, because of the peace he brought to all sides. Thus, it has received additional light Mochin from above, namely from Arich Anpin which is Chochmah, and from all sides, namely from the right and left. From Its own Central Column, it has achieved Chassadim and Gvurot, and the joy of all the worlds is in It. This is the secret of the illumination of Chochmah that eliminates all the Klipot. And from this additional of gaiety, the foundation (Yesod) of the world issued and is called an addition. From here, Yesod, all the lower powers, spirits and holy souls of the righteous, come out according to the secret of the sacred names Yud Hei Vav Hei-Tzva'ot which means that He is a sign that appears in all his hosts. He is also called El the Elohim of the spirits, from whom all the spirits and souls of the righteous emanate.",
                "The night, Master of all Earth, is the Female principle. She emanates from the left side, from that darkness. Because the entire desire of that darkness was to be included within the Right Column and receive light, its power was weakened. When night began to expand from the left before its structure was completed, the darkness namely the Left Column entered and merged with the Right Column, and the Right held on to it. Night then was left lacking at its end, because its source, which is the Left Column, disappeared in the Right Column and did not help it reach completion.",
                "So now there are two things lacking in the Female principle: (1) the aspect of the night, meaning darkness instead of light, and (2) her structure was not completed by the left. Just as darkness, which is the left, desires to be included within the light of the Right Column, so the Female principle, which is night, desires to be included within day. Darkness, which is the Left Column, abated its light because it had not yet completed the structure of the Female principle. Because of this, it produced the grade of the female with an incomplete structure and without light, namely with the two aforementioned defects. Therefore, the Female principle required two reforms: (1) to bring her light and free her from her darkness and (2) to complete her structure. Darkness, the Left Column, cannot illuminate unless it merges with the light of the right. And the same applies to the night, which is constructed in the left and emerges from it. It does not show any light unless it merges with the day, Yesod. The defect of the structure of the night is not completed until the Musaf (additional prayer), which is the additional light that Yesod has received from the Central Column namely, the excessive illumination of Chochmah in Zeir Anpin. And this additional light completes the structure of the Female principle. So what was added to one place is diminished in another. This means that what was added to the Sefirah of Yesod of Zeir Anpin by the Central Column, the Left Column of Zeir Anpin, has caused a diminution and lack in the Female principle. But Yesod fills up this lack with its additional light.",
                "The Musaf, which is Yesod of Zeir Anpin, contains the secret of the supernal point, which is Arich Anpin, and the secret of the central pillar, which is Tiferet of Zeir Anpin that reconciles all sides. Because of this, two letters were added to Yesod, which are Vav and Yud, in the phrase: \"And Elohim called (Heb. vayikra) the light day\" (Genesis 1:5), in which the letter Vav alludes to the light of Chassadim that it received from the Central Column and the Yud to the light of Chochmah that it received from Arich Anpin. In the emanation on the Female principle, which is night, these two letters were missing. So of her it is written קָרָא, without the Vav and Yud. Of the Day, which is Yesod, it is written וַיִּקְרָא. He subtracted, in the Female principle, the letters Vav and Yud from vayikra, and so it is written of her only \"he called (kara) night.\" Here lies the secret of the name with the 72 letters that are inscribed in the supernal crown - referring to the secret of the letters Vav and Yud."

                "\"And Elohim said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters'\" (Genesis 1:6). This phrase alludes to a detailed reform of the separation of the upper from the lower waters according to the secret of the left. Here, the dispute according to the secret of the left occurred. Until this point, referring to the first day, reference is made to the right. But on the second day, reference is to the secret of the governing of the left. Because of this, a great dispute broke out on the second day between the two sides. The left wanted to cancel the governing power of the right entirely, while the right wanted to cancel the governing power of the left entirely. The right, which is the secret of Chesed and the first day, is the perfection of all. Because of this, everything was written in the right on the first day. This means that all the seven days, which are the seven Sefirot, emerged in it and are hinted in it, because every perfection depends on the right side. When the rule of the left was aroused, its dispute with the right began and the fire of anger in that dispute became fierce. From this dispute, Gehenom was created. So Gehenom was awakened, and created by the left, and cleaved to it, which means that whoever wants to strengthen the left shall fall into Gehenom, which originates from it.",
                "In his wisdom, Moses looked into this and learned about the work of Creation. In the work of Creation, there was a dispute between the left and the right. And in that dispute, which the left provoked, Gehenom was created and Gehenom held on to the left. The central pillar, which is Tiferet, entered between them on the third day, ending the dispute and bringing the two sides to an agreement. So Gehenom removed itself from the left and descended below. The left joined the right, and there was peace everywhere.",
                "A similar dispute occurred between Korah and Aaron, the left against the right. Moses studied the Creation and said, 'I am one able to eliminate the dispute between right and left.' Moses tried his best to reconcile them, but the left did not want to be reconciled. So Korah become stronger and overcame Aaron.",
                "Moses said, assuredly, because of the power of the disagreement of the left, Gehenom should cling to it, just as it was in the works of Creation. Korah did not wish to be attached above, namely to the structure of holiness, and join the right, like the left on high. So assuredly, he shall descend below, down into Gehenom, because of the fierceness of his anger. As happened in the works of Creation, Gehenom came out and cleaved to the left. Moses knew that with the strength of Korah's anger, Korah would descend to Gehenom and be attached to it.",
                "Because of this, Korah did not want Moses to settle this dispute, since it was not for heaven's sake (with pure intentions). He had no respect for the celestial glory, which is the Shechinah, and refused to acknowledge the work of Creation. This means that he denied the settlement of the Central Column. in the work of Creation. He wanted only the left to govern. As soon as Moses realized that he was denying the work of Creation and being rejected out of holiness, \"Moses was much angered\" (Numbers 16:15).",
                "\"And Moses was much angered,\"because Korah and his company refused to acknowledge him and did not allow him to settle the dispute. It is written \"much,\" because they denied the acknowledgment of the work of Creation. So Korah denied 1. Korah denied everything above in Zeir Anpin and below in the souls, as it is written: \"When they strove against Hashem\" (Numbers 26:9) which is the secret of Zeir Anpin, for the damage that he did reached both above to Zeir Anpin and below to Moses. Therefore, Korah cleaved on to what he deserved; he reached Gehenom, as written, \"They went down alive into Sheol\" (Numbers 16:33).",
                "Another dispute was settled like above. A dispute that rose and did not come down and was based on decency was that between Shammai and Hillel. Shammai was the aspect of the left on high, while Hillel was the aspect of the supernal right. And the Holy One, blessed be He, intervened between them and approved of them. This means that the differences and arguments between Shammai and Hillel reached them from the Central Column of above, which is the secret of the Holy One, blessed be He. This was a dispute for the sake (name) of heaven, and the heavens, Zeir Anpin, reconciled this dispute to establish both. Because of this, their illuminations continue to exist. This dispute is like the work of Creation. It is similar to what the Central Column achieved for the sake of establishing the work of Creation. But Korah denied the establishing of the work of Creation and the dispute was toward the heavens, namely Zeir Anpin, that is, the reconciling Column. And he wanted to deny the principles of the Torah, which is Zeir Anpin. Assuredly this dispute and denial was the result of the efforts of Gehenom, and its power of Judgment cleaved to Korah and he to it. Thus, he fell into Gehenom.",
                "This secret appears in the Book of Adam. When darkness was aroused to take control, it emerged in all its might and created Gehenom within it, and Gehenom cleaved to it in that dispute. As the anger and the might of the Gevurot were calmed down, the dispute was aroused in a different manner, as a dispute of love.",
                "There were two kinds of disputes: One at the beginning and one at the end. This is the path of the righteous, which is hard in the beginning, because it is full of suffering, but ends in peace. Korah, being the left, was the beginning of the dispute between the right and the left, which was full of anger and fierceness. Each wanted to diminish the illumination of its neighbor. From this, Gehenom emerged and Korah cleaved to Gehenom. Shammai was also the aspect of the left, but at the end of the dispute between the right and the left, when anger was forgotten and the dispute of love was set in motion so as to receive approval from the heavens, which is the Column that settles the dispute.",
                "This is the secret of the verse: \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide...\" (Genesis 1:6) This is the first dispute, aroused by anger and force, in which each wanted to overcome and annul its neighbor. The Holy One, blessed be He, wished to nullify the dispute and Gehenom was aroused until the anger and aggressiveness cooled down. Then it is written: \"And Elohim made the firmament and divided...\" (Ibid. 7). This division is the dispute, carried with love and friendship, which supports the world. According to this secret, (namely through the dispute of love) is carried the dispute between Shammai and Hillel namely the dividing of \"And Elohim made the firmament\" at the end of the dispute. On the other hand, the dispute of Korah was one of anger which is the dividing of \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters\" at the beginning of the dispute. So the dispute of Shammai and Hillel was for the sake of heaven, in which the Oral Torah, which is the secret of the Female principle, entered with love into the Written Torah, which is Zeir Anpin and called heaven. And they were in perfect union.",
                "Division certainly applies to the left alone, as is written in relation to the second day: \"And let it divide.\" (Ibid. 6) While of Korah, it is written: \"Is it but a small thing to you, that the Elohim of Yisrael has separated you\" (Numbers 16:9). It is also written: \"At that time Hashem separated the tribe of Levi\" (Deuteronomy 10:8). So, assuredly the separation appears only in the second day in the place of the left.",
                "You may ask: If division occurs definitely on the second day, why then is the separation mentioned about Levi, who is the third son of Jacob? It should have been associated with Simon, who is the second son of Jacob. The answer is that although Levi is the third son, according to Jacob's mind he is the second, because Reuben is not considered the first son of Leah, as at the time Jacob thought she was Rachel. So the separation is forever in the second, because after the division has occurred in the second, everything goes smoothly along the straight path in a perfect way, as it should be. This is because by the separation, the lights enclothe each other and are completed by each other.",
                "The Havdalah (prayer of separation) that is performed at the end of Shabbat is for the purpose of separating those powers that are dominant during the days of the week from holiness that is dominant during Shabbat. With the ending of Shabbat, one aspect of Gehenom appears. It is the evil eye that desires to govern the world, just as Yisrael recite, \"O Prosper it, the work of our hands\" (Psalms 90:17). It emerges from that grade of the Other Side, which is called the left, and wishes to mingle with the seed of Yisrael by taking control over the holy covenant and having power to punish Yisrael.",
                "While Yisrael perform an action, a precept, using the myrtle and the wine and recite the Havdalah, the Other Side departs from them. That side is lowered and enters into its place in Sheol, in the place where Korah and his company are, as it is written: \"They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol\" (Numbers 16:33). So Korah and his company did not go down to Gehenom until Yisrael separated from them, as it is written: \"Separate yourselves from among this congregation\" (Ibid. 21). Here as well, the Other Side does not go to Gehenom at the ending of Shabbat before Yisrael performs the Havdalah.",
                "So the separation (Heb. הַבְדָּלָה) is always on the second day, which is the Left Column. This refers to what has already been explained, that even the Havdalah at the ending of Shabbat is intended to separate the Other Side that extends from the Left Column. It was at the beginning of the dispute, which was aroused by the aggressiveness and anger of the left before it was calmed down and quieted, that Gehenom was created. Then were created all these angels that denounce before the Holy One, blessed be He, their Master, above, the secret of the Central Column. They disagree with his reconciliation and deviate to the left. Therefore, fire burns them up and they are consumed. And the other angels, all those who are annulled and have no support, are burned in the fire. All these have come from the power of the fire of the dispute in the beginning, on the second day. Similarly, Korah fell down into Gehenom and burned, just like those angels who burned in the fire of Nahar Dinur (Eng. 'River of Fire'). And everything follows the same manner, extending from the beginning of this dispute with the fire of anger.",
                "\"Let there be a firmament\" tells us that an expansion has occurred between the two. The lower waters expanded and were separated from the upper waters, and the upper waters expanded and were separated from the lower waters by the firmament. The letters El (Aleph-Lamed) in the name Elohim (Aleph-Lamed-Hei-Yud-Mem) from the firmament up are of the right part. In other words, El always alludes to the name of Chesed, which is the right side. The name great El has expanded from within the waters and is separated from them. This means that because of the firmament, the name great El has spread upward and has separated itself from the other waters, namely the three letters Hei-Yud-Mem. This was to complete the name El and to include the upper and lower waters within each other through that expansion. And the name El of Elohim expanded, leaving only the three letters Hei-Yud-Mem. Hei-Yud-Mem then expanded down below the firmament and became the lower waters, Yud-Mem-Hei. This is the expansion into the second one, that is, Hei- Yud-Mem into Yud-Mem-Hei. The upper waters are Hei-Yud -Mem, as written, \"So is this great and wide sea (Heb. hayam, Hei-Yud-Mem)\" (Tehilim 104:25). Thus, Hei Yud Mem are the upper waters. If the letters Hei-Yud-Mem are in reversed order, that is, Yud-Mem-Hei, this indicates they are lower waters. Once the letters Yud-Mem-Hei were restored, they ascended and rose above the firmament and joined the name Great El and returned to the combination of the great sea (Heb. hayam), which was Hei-Yud-Mem. Then everyone, El and Hei-Yud-Mem were united as one, resulting in one name Elohim. And this name Elohim reached into many places.",
                "The upper waters are male; the lower waters are female. At first, before they were firmly established, they were mixed, but were later separated to distinguish the upper waters from the lower waters. And to differentiate them, one is called Elohim, which is Binah, and the other is called Adonai, which is Malchut. One is the upper Hei of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is Binah, and the other is the lower Hei of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is Malchut. It is then written about them: \"And Elohim made the firmament\" (Genesis 1:7). This expansion assumed the name Elohim, for the verse: \"And Elohim made\" indicates that the expansion of Hei-Yud-Mem returned back to El and merged into the name Elohim and the upper waters. For the name Elohim is the upper waters 1. and the name Adonai, the Female principle of Zeir Anpin, is the female waters. Nevertheless, since the male waters, or the letters Hei-Yud-Mem, were completed only by the female waters {namely, the Female principle of Zeir Anpin} the name Elohim expanded everywhere, {including the female waters.}",
                "Although on the second day, the upper and lower waters were divided, the dispute between the right and the left, {which are the letters Aleph-Lamed and Hei-Yud-Mem}, did not cease until the third day, {which is Tiferet}. The third day settled the dispute between the right and the left, as the two Columns Aleph-Lamed and Hei-Yud-Mem enclothed each other, and both were established properly in their places. Because of this dispute, even though the world exists upon it, it is not written: \"it was good\" about the second day, because the work was not yet completed on that day. So the upper and lower waters were mingled together as one, and there was no offspring in the world until they were divided in two and distinguished as separate from each other. Only then did they bring forth offspring.",
                "Although the separation of the lower waters from the upper waters occurred on the second day, the dispute between El, which is the Right, and Hei-Yud-Mem, which is the Left, was unresolved. Only the third day reconciled between them. Both became equal and joined them into the one name Elohim. The third day, which is Zeir Anpin, is the name, upon which is engraved Hei-Vav-Hei, to make the upper waters, Binah, equal to the lower waters, Malchut. Because the letters Hei-Vav-Hei are the secret of the two Heis with Vav between them: the upper Hei is Binah, and the lower Hei is Malchut. The Vav in between is Zeir Anpin and it completes and illuminates both sides, above in Binah and below in Malchut. This was signified by the splitting of the waters of the Jordan, where the upper waters rose in a heap and did not flow down into the Dead Sea. This is the secret of the upper Hei of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, namely Binah. On the other hand, the lower waters which are the secret of the lower Hei, Malchut flowed down into the Dead Sea which is the secret of the lower Hei, Malchut. And Yisrael, the secret of the letter Vav, went in the middle between the upper waters and the lower waters of the Jordan. Thus Yisrael, the secret of the Vav of Yud Hei Vav Hei, received the abundance from the upper Hei and bestowed it upon the lower Hei.",

They all are comprised of each other. Had the Central Column not settled the dispute, neither would have included the other nor be harmonized. These five firmaments are equivalent to the 500 years to which the Tree of Life, which is Zeir Anpin, is attached to produce offspring and fruits in the world. All the waters of Creation, namely the kinds of Mochin that flow out from Beresheet, which is Arich Anpin, are divided under it and through it into the upper waters and the lower waters. King David, who is the secret of the Female principle, receives everything from Zeir Anpin. He then distributes it down to the lower worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, as it is written: \"And he distributed among all the people, among the whole multitude\" (II Samuel 6:19). It is also written: \"You give it to them; they gather it\" (Psalms 104:28) and \"She rises also while it is yet night, and gives food\" (Proverbs 31:15).",

The spirits produced from within that mist immediately congealed; they became dry and without any moisture. These spirits, which were male and female, produced a multitude of evil spirits. From this, all the might of the impure spirit appeared in all those strong spirits. This is the secret of the Kelipah of the foreskin. These spirits were strengthened in impurity through the violent demons. One is called a viper and the other a serpent, and these two kinds become one. The viper bears offspring every seventy years, while the serpent only every seven years. But as they are joined together, everything returned to the seven years of the serpent. Therefore, the viper begets every seven years like the serpent, and they become as if one species.",
                "From here lies the secret of Gehenom, which has seven names, and the Evil Inclination, which also has seven names. From here, impurity expands and spreads out in many grades into the world. And everything comes from the principle of the left, which contains good and evil and thereby, makes the world habitable. From here is the secret of the Holy Name that is engraved by eighteen letters and is responsible for the bountiful rains that feed the earth, for human charity, for all our blessings, and for the general inhabitation of this world."

Everything flows mysteriously from the secret of that primal point, which is Arich Anpin, until the light reaches and is gathered in the supernal chamber. From there it then flows in a straight line to the other grades, namely to Zeir Anpin, until it reaches that one place where everything is gathered according to the secret of male and female. He asks: And what is that place? He replied: This is the life of the worlds {<i>namely Yesod of Zeir Anpin, which is the male who is united with Malchut, which is the Female principle. Thus, it comprises male and female together.</i>}",
                "The waters mentioned in the verse flow from above, {from the upper Hei of the Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is Yisrael Saba and Tevunah.} The words \"under the heaven\" allude to small Vav, <i>which is Yesod of Zeir Anpin. Zeir Anpin is called great Vav, while his Yesod is called small Vav.</i> Therefore, when the letter Vav is pronounced, two Vav's are heard. The first one is heaven, <i>namely Zeir Anpin</i>, and the second one is under the heaven, <i>namely Yesod of Zeir Anpin. After the Mochin are drawn from the upper Hei which is Binah down under the heaven which is Yesod of Zeir Anpin it is written:</i> \"And let the dry land appear\" (Ibid.). This is the lower Hei <i>namely Malchut</i>, the Female principle <i>of Zeir Anpin because only she was revealed as dry land</i>, while all the other grades were hidden. From within that last grade, <i>referring to the lower Hei, Malchut, </i>that light that was concealed was heard and revealed.",
                "The phrase \"to one place\" is called Yesod because there is a connection to the union of the upper world through Yesod. The verse: \"Hashem shall be one, and His Name One\" (Zechariah 14:9) hints at two unions. One is the upper world that is unified in its own grades, which is the secret of: \"Hashem is one\" and the second is the lower world that is unified in its own grades, according to the secret: \"And His Name One.\" The unification of the upper world by the secret of \"Hashem is one\" is up to Yesod. The life of the worlds, which is Yesod, is sweetened in Binah, and the upper world is connected to its unification. Because of this, it is called: \"to one place,\" as all the grades and all the parts, gather there. And they become as one in it, without any separation at all. No grade unites there wholly save this grade, in which all the lights are mysteriously covered in one desire. Up to this point, referring to the words: \"And let the dry land appear,\" the revealed world which is the secret of Rachel is unified with the concealed world which is Leah.",
                "10.The revealed world, <i>which is Rachel, the Female principle of Zeir Anpin</i> who is located from his Chest downward, is similarly unified below. The revealed world is the lower world, <i>as can be proven by reading the scriptures, where it is described in terms of seeing:</i> \"I saw Hashem\" (Isaiah 6:1), \"and they saw the Elohim of Yisrael\" (Exodus 24:10), \"and the glory of Hashem appeared (Numbers 14:10) and \"As the appearance of the rainbow...so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Hashem\" (Ezekiel 1:28). And it is known that the lower Female principle, <i>who is called Rachel, </i>is described by the words: \"Glory of Hashem\" and by the particle Et (the). This is the secret of the verse: \"Let the dry land appear (lit. 'be seen'),\" <i>because \"seeing\" applies only to the revealed world and not to the upper world.</i> The verse: \"As the appearance of the rainbow,\" which is written about the divine Chariot of Yechezkel, alludes to the life of the worlds, namely Yesod of Zeir Anpin. Therefore, it is written in the portion of Noah: \"I have set My rainbow in the cloud\" (Genesis 9:13), which also alludes to Yesod of Zeir Anpin, who is called the life of the worlds. The phrase \"in the cloud\" refers to Malchut; namely, the lower Female principle of Zeir Anpin, the revealed world of Rachel. The words \"I have set\" mean that he has set his rainbow in the cloud ever since the day of Creation.",
                "That cloudy day, which is described in the verse: \"And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud\" (Ibid. 14)<i> indicates that only then shall the rainbow be seen according to the secret of </i>\"the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Hashem,\" <i>and not at any other time. Why is this so?</i> As the left is aroused, Rachel emerges to her own aspect \"and she had hard labor\" (Genesis 35:16). <i>Therefore it is said that three angels stay by her side: </i>Michael at one side, {the right side}; Raphael at one side, {in the middle}; and Gabriel at one side, {the left side}. And from them she receives her strength to give birth. These three aspects are the colors seen in the form of the rainbow: white, red and green.",
                "The phrase \"so was the appearance of the brightness round about\" alludes to the illumination that was concealed and has disappeared within the pupil of the eye. So the phrase: \"This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Hashem\" applies to the colors in the \"appearance of the rainbow\" and not to \"the appearance of the brightness.\" This is because the lower union of the three colors of the rainbow corresponds with the upper union.",
                "The three names \"Hashem our Elohim; Hashem,\" which appear in the verse: \"Hear, O Yisrael\" (Devarim 6:4) allude to the three colors, white, red, and green when they are concealed, invisible, and attached to one place. This is the secret of the first union in the upper world that is called one place. And the colors united in the rainbow below which are white, red and green correspond to the three concealed colors of the upper union: Hashem our Elohim Hashem. These colors of the rainbow belong to another union, which is the secret of: \"And his Name One,\" the lower union. It is the secret of the verse: 'Blessed be the Name of the glory of His Kingdom for ever and ever (Heb. baruch shem kevod...),' that we respond after \"Hear, O Yisrael,\" which is the lower union. The upper union indicated by the verse: \"Hear, O Yisrael, Hashem our Elohim; Hashem is One\" corresponds to the lower union: 'Blessed be the name of the Glory of his Kingdom for ever and ever.'

In this verse, \"who\" alludes to Binah. This is what is meant by: \"Let the waters...be gathered.\" Here in the verse: \"Let the waters...be gathered\" is the extent of the entire Mochin of He who forms the worlds, namely Zeir Anpin, and which is hinted at in the name Yud Hei Vav Hei, fully spelled with Aleph's, as Yud-Vav-Dalet, Hei-Aleph, Vav-Aleph-Vav, Hei-Aleph.",

The Mochin are drawn down into it in a concealed and a hidden manner. And from within it come forth supernal and concealed souls and holy hosts. These are formed and drawn, using the edifices of Faith, by the righteous, the men of Faith - namely the female waters - by worshipping their Master.",

This is the living creature that crouches on a thousand mountains and for whom grass is grown every day. This grass refers to those angels who govern only for a specific time, but then must vanish immediately; because they were created on the second day, their dominion draws upon the Left Column that was created on the second day. In their dominion they wish to annul the right. They are destined to be food for this living creature, which means that nothing of their illumination is drawn down to the lower beings. Only the Female principle enjoys it, and then she burns and annuls them with it as there is fire that consumes fire, which is the dominion of the Left, called 'fire.'",

Ofanim) are the angels of Asiyah, the holy living creatures are the angels of Yetzirah and the Cherubs are the angels of Briyah. All of these are made ready and clothed by the Creator Himself. However, they are further prepared when people worship their Master with sacrifices and prayer. This is what is meant by \"the service of man.\" The plants were predestined and prepared for \"the service of man\" and will be further perfected by that service, as it should be.",

This is what is meant: \"herb yielding seed\" (Gen. 1:12), which is the secret of the Mochin. The grass (hay) does not yield any seed, but is intended to be consumed by the sacred fire of the Female principle, as explained above, whereas the herb, which yields seed, is intended for the improvement of the world.",

This means that the fruit tree is the Female principle of Zeir Anpin; \"yielding fruit\" alludes to Yesod of Zeir Anpin, which is male. It is said to be \"yielding fruit\" because all the fruit that the female yields reaches her from the male. Just as the \"fruit tree,\" which is the Female principle, reveals the potential power that it received from the \"fruit tree yielding fruit,\" which is the male, so it reveals her own potential as well. What is revealed from the potential of the Female principle herself? The Cherubs and pillars are revealed from her own aspect. What are these pillars? They are those that rise up in the smoke of the sacrifice and become stronger because of the offering. They are called \"columns of smoke.\" This is the secret of the verse: \"Who is this coming out of the wilderness like columns of smoke\" (Song of Songs 3:6). So the Cherubs are the secret of the \"herb\" that she receives from the male and the \"columns of smoke\" are the \"grass.\" The Cherubs and pillars exist for \"the service of men,\" but not the \"grass,\" which is meant for food, as it is written: \"Behold now animals (Heb. בְּהֵמוֹת), which I made with you; he eats grass like an ox\" (Job 40:15).",

The male and female are not like the Cherubs, which are hinted at in the phrase: \"herb yielding seed.\" The male and female have large faces with beards, whereas the Cherubs have small faces like those of babies.

Because since he is the angel of Chesed, he sketches the imprint to the south, which is to the right. Man is male and female, and he is not called man unless both are included. This means that Malchut on her own, when she is not mating with Zeir Anpin, is not called man; only when they are united are they called man. This is the secret of the verse: \"male and female He created them; and blessed them, and called their name man\" (Gen. 5:2). So accordingly, they were together called man, but each one alone is only half a body and cannot be called man.

Every night when a man sleeps, his spirit removes the covering and ascends. This fire that consumes fire, namely the Female principle of Zeir Anpin, consumes and burns this spirit.

This is the secret of the verse: \"All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full\" (Kohelet 1:7). The Female principle is called the \"Sea\" and the \"rivers\" are the souls. So the verse actually means that all the souls flow into the Female principle, yet she is not full. And the reason she is not yet full is because the souls run into the sea, which receives them and burns them inside it. Because of this, the sea is not yet full.

                "From here (Yisrael-Saba and Tevunah) on, each one expanded within the other and became enclothed by one another until all the grades enclothed one another. One was the inner part and the other the outer layer. Though one is a garment in relation to what is above it, it has also become the inner aspect of another grade, a grade that is below it. (So Abba and Imma, which are considered a garment for Arich Anpin, became the inner part and internal aspect of Yisrael - Saba and Tevunah. Thus, Yisrael-Saba and Tevunah, which form a garment for Abba and Imma, became the inner part for Zeir Anpin. Thus, Zeir Anpin which is a garment for Yisrael-Saba and Tevunah became the inner part for his Female principle.) The same thing occurred below in the lower worlds (of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah. The Female principle of Atzilut is enclothed within Briyah, and Briyah within Yetzirah and Yetzirah within Asiyah. Accordingly, the Neshamah in a man is enclothed within the Ruach and the Ruach within the Nefesh and the physical body. In this image, the human being exists in this world with an inner part and an outer shell, which correspond to a spirit and a body.) All this is for the perfection of the world.",
                "When the moon was united with the sun, the moon had its own light. But after the moon was separated from the sun, it descended to the world of Briyah and was placed in charge of the hosts of Briyah, it belittled itself and diminished its own light. So Kelipot upon Kelipot were created, one above the other, to conceal the inner part. All this occurred to complete the light of the inner part, because without a shell no fruit can be had. This is the reason why it is written: \"Let there be luminaries (מְאֹרֹת),\" without Vav, which means a curse, because of the Kelipot that emerge due to the diminution of the light of the moon. All this was done for the perfection of the world. Therefore, it is written: \"To give light upon the earth\" (Gen. 1:15), as these Kelipot emerged in the secret of the shell that precedes the fruit."

                "\"And Elohim made the two great luminaries\" (Gen. 1:16). \"And...made\", וַיַּעַשׂ, signifies the greatness and the full establishment of everything, as it should be. The phrase: \"The two great luminaries\" indicates that the two great luminaries, (which are Zeir Anpin and his Female principle) were united at first. This is the secret of the full name Yud Hei Vav Hei - Elohim, which although not openly revealed can be surmised.",
                "So the \"two great luminaries\" appear in a full name, even though the name Elohim shines only in a concealed way. The word \"great\" means that Zeir Anpin and his Female principle grew in greatness by this name as equals, so much so that they were called by the name that unites everything together, which is Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi. Zeir Anpin received his greatness from the right one, his Female principle from the left one. In such a way, they are referred to as \"the two great luminaries.\" These are the most supernal names that precede the thirteen attributes of Mercy. The names Mem-Tzadi-Pe- Tzadi Mem-Tzadi-Pe-Tzadi are called \"great,\" because they became great and ascended, since they are supernal and derive from the secret of above. They benefit the world, as the worlds' existence depends on them. Similarly, the two luminaries that appear in the verse, which are Zeir Anpin and his Female principle, both rose as one, in one greatness.",
                "The moon was not at ease with the sun because she felt embarrassed before it. The moon said to the sun: \"Where do you feed your flock? Why do you make your flock to rest at noon?\" (Shir Hashirim 1:7). This is as if to say: How can a tiny candle shine in the middle of the day? \"Why should I be like one who cloaks himself?\" (Ibid.) That is: how can I remain in shame? Then she lowered herself to be head of the lower beings, as it is written: \"Go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock\" (Ibid. 8). Thus, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to her, 'Go and diminish yourself.'",
                "From then on, she had no light of her own. She had only the light she received from the sun. At first, they were united as one on the same level, but she later lowered herself from all of its grades. This means that it lost all her grades and emerged from the world of Atzilut. Although she is the head of the lower worlds of Briyah, Yetzirah and Asiyah, she is nevertheless considered to have lost all her grades, as in principle a woman has no significance unless she is together with her husband. In other words, because the Female principle is separated from Zeir Anpin, her husband, and has left the world of Atzilut to go to that of Briyah, she has brought about the loss of all her grades. Even though she has become head in the world of Briyah, she does not consider this to be significant because she is separated from her husband, who is in the world of Atzilut. The phrase: \"The greater luminary\" (Gen. 1:16) alludes to Zeir Anpin, who is called by the name Yud Hei Vav Hei. \"The lesser luminary\" (Ibid.) alludes to the Female principle, who is called by the name Elohim, the last of the grades and an end to Thought namely, an end to the world of Atzilut that is called Thought. At first, the Female principle was inscribed above in Zeir Anpin in the fourth letter of the Holy Name Yud Hei Vav Hei, because the female is the lower Hei. In other words, when she was on the same level with Zeir Anpin, she was the lower Hei of the name Yud Hei Vav Hei. But afterward, she lowered herself to be called by the name Elohim.",
                "In spite of all this, the Female principle ascended on all sides and shone in all directions from above; that is, before she diminished herself and when she was the lower Hei in the assembling of the letters of the Holy Name, Yud Hei Vav Hei. Later, when she belittled herself, the grades expanded out from all sides, which means that she shone from the aspect of being before the lower Hei of Yud Hei Vav Hei and also from the aspect of being now the name Elohim. The grades that expanded from the aspect of her being above, from the lower Hei of Yud Hei Vav Hei, are called the \"rule (of) the day\" (Ibid.). The grades that expanded from the aspect of her being below, from the name Elohim, are called the \"rule (of) the night\" (Ibid.).",
                "The words \"the stars\" (Gen. 1:16) allude to countless hosts and groups of angels, who are all suspended in that \"firmament of heaven\" that is Yesod of Zeir Anpin and is called life of the worlds, as it is written: \"And Elohim set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth\" (Ibid. 17).",
                "The kingdom of the house of David was established on this day, the fourth day, which is the fourth leg that supports the throne. It happened on the fourth day because the letters were completed and fixed in their places properly. In spite of all this, Malchut (kingdom) was not fixed properly in its place before the sixth day, because only then was the image of man completed and properly established. On the sixth day, the upper throne and the lower throne were established and all the worlds settled in their places. All the letters were set in their spheres 1. after untying and releasing the complicated tie that existed among the letters.",
                "The fourth day, which is the kingdom of David, was rejected by the builders, as it is written: \"The stone which the builders rejected...\" (Tehilim 118:22) and also \"my mother's children were angry with me\" (Shir Hashirim 1:6). For this light, (referring to Malchut) lowered itself and diminished its own radiance while the Kelipot were established in their places. This gave place to the emerging of the Kelipot and their rule. Thus she seemed loathsome in the eyes of the righteous that built it. Only later, when she was completed and ready for union with Zeir Anpin, was it said she \"has become the head stone of the corner\" (Tehilim 118:22). All those lights that shone during the 6,000 year period were suspended in this firmament of heaven to establish with them the throne of David, namely, the kingdom (Malchut) of David.",
                "These lights of the kingdom of David shape the form below in order to prepare the form of all those that pertain to the inner form of the face of a man, because every inner form is so called, namely, the face of a man. From this, you should realize that every shape included in this expansion of the letter final Nun is called man, even though they do not actually have the face of a man. Hence, it is written: \"But you...are men\" (Yechezkel 34:31). You are called men, but not the rest of the idolatrous nations.",
                "Every spirit is called man, which means that only the aspect of the light of the spirit that is enclothed within the body is called man. So the body of the spirit of the holy side is only a garment; in other words, the spirit is the actual essence of man and the body is only its covering. But on the Other Side, the opposite applies. This is why it is written: \"You have clothed me with skin and flesh...\" (Iyov 10:11). The flesh of man is only a garment covering the essence of man, which is the spirit. Wherever it is written the flesh of man, it hints that the essence of man is inside. The flesh is only a vestment for man, a body for him, but the essence of man is the aspect of his spirit.",
                "For the lower aspects were melted with the melting of this spirit of the face of man, and other forms were fashioned, enclothed in a different kind of garment not by that of man, but of Kosher animals. These include: ox, sheep, goats, kids of the goats, rams, deer, fallow-deer and so on. They would have preferred to be included in the vestment of the face of a man, but were not. They became vestments for others; namely, garments for the face of an ox, the face of an eagle and the face of a lion. The inner spirit of the ox, sheep and goat, is called by the same name as the body of that spirit, because the body is a vestment for that name but does not own it. The body is the flesh of the ox and the ox is the inner spirit of that body; namely, its flesh is its garment. So it is with all animals; their bodies are named after the inner spirit that is enclothed within them.",
                "It is similar with the Other Side, which is not holy. The spirit that spreads within the idolatrous nations issues from the side that is not holy and is not the aspect of man. Therefore, it is not called by this name, as has been written: \"But you...are men.\" The name of this spirit is defiled. It is not called man and has no share in him because it extends from the wicked man (lit. 'man without elevation'), who does not want to ascend to the face of man above. So his body, the vestment of his spirit, is impure and his flesh is defiled. The impure part, which is the spirit, is on the inside and the flesh is his vestment. As long as the spirit dwells within that body, it is considered defiled. As the spirit leaves that vestment, namely the body, neither the body nor the vestment is called impure any longer, as the impure one, that is the spirit, has departed from it.",
                "From the lower aspects referring to animals, beasts and birds that were molded into shape by that impure spirit forms, namely private spirits, were drawn out. These were enclothed by other vestments, such as the forms of impure animals, and the Torah said of them, \"These shall be unclean to you\" (Vayikra 11:29). These forms include pigs and the birds and animals that belong to the Other Side. The spirit is called by that name, that is, defiled, and the body is its vestment. The body is called the flesh of the pig, because it is a pig in its inner being, in its spirit, while the flesh is a garment covering that spirit. Therefore, both aspects, those included within the secret of man and those included with the secret of the impure, are separated from and oppose each other. On the side of holiness are the spirit of man in general, and the spirits of pure animals, beasts and fowl, which are the particular. From the side of wicked man is the impure wicked man, who is considered the general aspect, and the spirits of impure animals, beasts and fowl, that are the particulars. They oppose each other. Every kind of animal stays with its own kind and does not mix with the opposite kind. Even if it does, it eventually returns to its own kind.",

For the dominion of the two lights is a proper dominion.",
                "\"The greater luminary,\" (namely Zeir Anpin) rules the day and \"the lesser luminary,\" which is his Female principle, rules the night. The secret learned from here is that the male rules by day and fills up the house with all that is needed, such as food and sustenance. As soon as night falls and the female takes command, everything in the house falls under her control, because then it is time for her dominion. As it is written: \"She rises also while it is yet night and gives food to her household\" (Mishlei 31:15); \"she\" and not \"he.\" So the Female principle, not Zeir anpin, gives at night, as the dominion over the day belongs to the male and the dominion over the night belongs to the female.",
                "The \"greater luminary\" is the sun, which has twelve openings and twelve hours, as the sun rules over the day. The \"lesser luminary\" is the moon, which also has twelve openings, the moon rules over the night, which has twelve hours. For this reason, it is written: \"On that day Hashem shall be one, and His Name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9). \"One\" is mentioned twice: once for Yud Hei Vav Hei, who is Zeir Anpin, \"the greater luminary,\" and once of His Name, which is the female, \"the lesser luminary.\" The sun together with its twelve openings becomes the thirteen attributes of Mercy. The moon together with its twelve openings also adds up to thirteen. So the sun becomes one and the moon becomes one; then it says, \"Hashem shall be one, and His Name One,\" because the numerical value of echad (one) adds up to thirteen. Thus, the sun and the moon become one and the day and night also become one. This is why it is written: \"And there was evening and there was morning, one day\" (Gen. 1:5). The secret of this union is only applicable on high.",
                "The verse: \"And the stars\" means that after the female has attained order in her house and retired with her husband, the maidens are left in charge of the house. The maidens who serve the female are called the stars. And the secret of the phrase \"And the stars\" is that the feminine principle turns control of the house over to them to deal with all the requirements of the house. That is, to prepare her for mating with the sun and to bestow the abundance of the day. This is during the darkness before dawn, when the maidens, the stars, rule, which is an inferior rule. Then darkness is doubled in the world. This is the secret meaning of, \"a portion to her maidens\" (Mishlei 31:15). Afterward, that is, after the mating in the darkness of the morning (before dawn breaks), the household returns to the dominion of the male during the day and everything is set properly in place. This means that the female is included within the male, according to the secret of the mating and is under his control. She reveals the light of the morning to the world, as it should be."

Because of this, a blessing is recited over the candle when Shabbat ends because, at that point, the luminaries of the fire are given permission to rule again.

                "Each and every measurement (that Malchut measures) is called a world (i.e. it is a grade of its own). Every one is a Yud and a Vav, a size and a measurement. The Vav is the weight (of light) and the Yud is the measurement of it. The size of the measurement is five cubits long and five cubits wide. This corresponds to the size of every firmament, which is five hundred parasangs long and five hundred parasangs wide. This is (the secret of) the two Hei's (in the Four Letter Name).",

Its five firmaments - (the last Heh of the Four Letter Name) - are called \"the (Heb. Hei) heavens\", the five firmaments included in 'the heavens.' The upper five are the 'heavens of the heavens'. These are Hei-Hei. The letter Vav is their sixth (firmament). (Malchut becomes) the seventh, and seven plus seven total fourteen. Here are those lands, seven upon seven lands that cover each other like onion rings. They are all alluded to in the two eyes.",

(The place) to make it short is at the aspect (of Gevurah) of Sh'varim (short blowings of the Shofar) (this is the Tevir). The middle, which is neither prolonged nor shortened, is Teruah. This is the central pillar and Shalshelet (lit. 'chain'), which chains both (according to the secret of) the Shekel of the sanctuary.",
                "Corresponding to Revi'a, which rises, there is the Cholam. The Sh'varim, (Tevir), is equivalent to the Shva. In this (Revia), one should raise his voice and in (pronouncing) the other, one should lower his voice. Because of this, it is Sh'varim (from the word 'to break'). This is done in secret, as it is written of the lower Shechinah: \"But her voice was not heard\" (I Samuel 1:13). Teruah is Shalshelet. The Revi'i is for raising the voice, the Tevir of the cantillation marks is for lowering the pitch. Shalshelet holds to the two Columns like a chain (and joins them together).",
                "It is like the Revi'i, with which one prolongs the word. It is a vowel like the Cholam. There is no vowel that does not have a corresponding cantillation mark. For example, the vowel Segol corresponds to the Segolta intonation, the vowel Shva corresponds to the intonation Zakef Gadol. There is always a vowel corresponding to a cantillation mark for all those who know the hidden secrets.",

The East took hold on the North, and the North awakened and, opening forth, called loud to the West that he should come to him. Then the West traveled up into the North and came together with it, and after that the South took hold on the West, and the North and the South surrounded the Garden, being its fences. Then the East drew near to the West, and the West was gladdened and it said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” {Gen. 1:26}, to embrace like us the four quarters and the higher and the lower.

When the lower union was rendered perfect, and Adam and Eve turned face to face, then was the upper union perfected.",
                "This we may know from the matter of the Tabernacle: for we have learned that together with it there was put up another tabernacle, nor was the upper one raised until the lower one was erected; and so it was in this case. Moreover, inasmuch as all above was not yet perfectly ordered, Adam and Eve were not created face to face. This is borne out by the order of the verses in the Scripture; first it is written, “For the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth,” and following, “there was not a man to till the ground” {ibid.},",

Further proof is that in the word <i>vayisgor</i> {and he closed}, there occurs for the first time in this passage the letter samekh, which signifies “support,” as much as to say that male and female they now supported the one the other. In like wise, do the lower world and the upper sustain each other.",

                "Then, “There went up a mist from the earth” {Gen. 2:6}, to make up for the lack, by “watering the whole face of the ground” {ibid.}; and the mist rising is the yearning of the female for the male.

It is from below that the movement starts, and thereafter is all perfected. If the Community of Israel failed to initiate the impulse, the One above would also not move to go to her, and it is thus the yearning from below which brings about the completion above."

All dismounted and sat down on the mountainside, under a tree. Rabbi Phineas spoke: While we sit, I should like to hear some of those wondrous ideas which figure in your discourse daily.",

He said: We might here have expected the word journey; but instead we read “journeys,” which is intended to mean that on the journey with him was the Divine Presence. It behooves a man to be “male and female,” always, so that his faith may remain stable, and in order that the Presence may never leave him.",
                " You will ask: How with the man who makes a journey, and, away from his wife, ceases to be “male and female”? Such a one, before starting, and while he still is “male and female,” must pray to God, to draw unto himself the Presence of his Master. After he has prayed and offered thanksgiving, and when the Presence is resting on him, then he may go, for by virtue of his union with the Presence he is now male and female in the country, just as he was male and female in the town, for it is written: “Righteousness {zedek, feminine of zaddik} shall go before him and shall make his footsteps a way” {Ps. 85:14}.",
                "time of his traveling a man should heed well his actions, lest the holy union break off, and he be left imperfect, deprived of the union with the female. If it was needful when he and his wife were together, how much greater the need when the heavenly mate is with him? And the more so, indeed, since this heavenly union acts as his constant guard on his journey, until his return home.",
                "Moreover, it is his duty, once back home, to give his wife pleasure, inasmuch as she it was who obtained for him the heavenly union. There is twofold reason for this duty of cohabitation. First, this pleasure is a religious one, giving joy also to the Divine Presence,",
                "and it is an instrument for peace in the world, as it stands written, “and thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation and not sin” {Job 5:24}. (It may be questioned, is it a sin if he fails to go in to his wife? It is a sin, for in his failure, he detracts from the honor of the heavenly mate who was given him by reason of his wife.) ",
                "Secondly, if his wife should conceive, the heavenly partner bestows upon the child a holy soul; for this covenant is called the covenant of the Holy One, be blessed. Hence, a man should be as zealous to enjoy this joy as to enjoy the joy of the Sabbath, at which time is consummated the union of the sages with their wives. Thus, “thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace,” for the Presence accompanies you and sojourns in your house, and for this reason “thou shalt visit thy habitation and not sin,” in gladly carrying out the religious duty to have conjugal intercourse before the Presence.",
                "So it is that the students of Torah, away from their wives the six days of the week they engage in study, are in this period attached to a heavenly mate, so that they do not cease to be “male and female.” And with the incoming of the Sabbath, it behooves them to rejoice their wives, to the honor of the heavenly union, and in seeking to do the will of their Master, as has been stated.",
                "In like wise, when a man’s wife is in her days of separation, in those days while he waits for her the man has with him the heavenly mate, so that he continues to be “male and female.” When the wife is purified, the man is in duty bound to rejoice her, in the joyful fulfillment of a religious obligation. The same reasons we have given apply also in this case. According to secret doctrine, the mystics are bound to give their whole mind and purpose to the one {the Shekhinah}.",
                " It may be objected that in the light of the previous argument, a man is in a state of more honor on a journey than at home, by virtue of the heavenly mate who is then with him. This is not so. At home, the wife is the foundation of a man’s house, inasmuch as it is by virtue of her that the Presence does not leave the house. So the verse, “and Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent” {Gen. 24:67}, our masters have interpreted to mean that the Divine Presence came to Isaac’s house along with Rebecca. ",
                "According to secret doctrine, the supernal Mother is together with the male only when the house is in readiness and at that time the male and female are conjoined. At such time blessings are showered forth by the supernal Mother upon them. Likewise, the lower Mother is found together with the male only when the house is in readiness, and the male goes in to the female and they conjoin together; then the blessings of the lower Mother are showered forth for them.",
                "Therefore, two females, his Mother and his wife, are to compass a man about in his house, like the Male above. There is reference to this in the verse “Unto {<i>ad</i>} the desire of the everlasting hills” {Gen. 49:26}.

So it is with the man in his house.",
                "But when he is on a journey, while the supernal Mother is still with him, the lower wife remains behind; and therefore on his returning, it behooves him to do that which will compass him about with two females, as we have explained..."

This is as it is written in the verse: \"If My covenant be not day and night, it were as if I had not appointed the ordinance of heaven and earth\" (Jeremiah 33:25). Therefore, Yisrael, who has accepted the covenant (of Bris Milah and protecting the bris) and observe it, have a portion in the World to Come.\t",
                "Not only this. As a result, they are called 'righteous.' We deduce from this that whoever observes the covenant upon which the world is established is called 'righteous.' How do we know this? We know this from Joseph, who observed the everlasting covenant (in the incident with Potiphar's wife), and was therefore called 'righteous.' And this is why it is written: \"Your people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land forever.\" (Rabbi Chiya thus explained the verse, \"Noah was a righteous man,\" as meaning that Noah observed the covenant).",
                "Rabbi Elazar said that we have learned that whenever the term \"These (Heb. אֵלֶּה)\" appears, it always annuls something previously mentioned. Now, it is written in the portion of Beresheet, \"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted\" (Gen. 2:10). This river (corresponding to Yesod) is drawn and comes out of Eden, (which is Chochmah), and enters the garden, (Malchut), to water it from the supernal waters and bring it pleasure, making it produce fruit and seed. This gives satisfaction to everyone. The garden is pleased which brings pleasure to the river. As it is written: \"Because in it He rested\" (Ibid. 3). And it is also written: \"And He rested on the seventh day\" (Ibid. 2) (He rested in the Garden that is Malchut). This is the secret of the matter, for it produces offspring, and no other Sefirah can produce any fruit.",

So now we have learned a secret, that Noah needed the ark so he could unite with it and preserve the seed of the whole world. As it is written: \"to keep seed alive\" (Gen. 7:3).",
                "What is the ark? It is the ark (Malchut) of the covenant. And Noah and the ark below were like (Yesod and Malchut) above. The covenant is mentioned in relation to Noah, as it is written: \"And I will establish My covenant with you\" (Gen. 6:18). As long as the covenant was not established in Noah, he did not enter the ark, as it is written: \"And I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark.\" Only then does the ark become the ark of the covenant, meaning that after the ark received and accepted Noah the righteous, who is the covenant, it became the ark of the covenant.",
                "So the ark and Noah are completely above. And because the covenant above brings forth offspring, so Noah begets generations. That is why \"These are the generations of Noah.\" This is to teach us that like the covenant above, (which is Yesod of Atzilut) Noah bore everlasting generations, because he merited the holy covenant, and Yesod of Atzilut, which is called the covenant, rests upon him.",
                "\"Noah was a righteous man.\" This is assuredly so, for his righteousness corresponds to (Yesod) above.

And what is (Yesod)? It is the Righteous. Thus, Noah is the righteous below, among the souls. And hence it is written: \"Noah was a righteous man\" to teach us that the world is maintained by him.",
                "And the secret of all this is revealed in the words, \"And Noah walked with Elohim\" (Gen. 6:9), which means to teach us that he never separated himself from Him. And he merited being called a righteous man on earth, as did the supernal Yesod, the foundation of the world. He is the covenant of peace and the peace of the world.

As it is written: \"Walk before Me and be perfect\" (Gen. 17:1). \"In his generations\" includes only Noah's descendants and not the generations in the world in general because they descended from him.

And until they were joined as one, the world had not reached a fully stable condition. And as soon as this occurred, it is written: \"From these was the whole earth overspread\" (Gen. 9:19). What is meant by \"overspread\", נָפְצָה? These words are analogous to the verse: \"and from thence the river parted\" (Gen. 2:10) (meaning that spreading out is similar to the supernal ark, which is the secret of the Garden). For from that point in the text onward, we find the separation and diffusion of progeny into all quarters of the world.

He is not named twice because when he approached the altar to be sacrificed, the soul that was within him in this world left him.

And that is why you shall find that the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, was not unified (on any righteous person in his lifetime). It was unified only on Isaac, because he was already considered as dead. He was like those who pass away from this world.

The friends have already explained this verse, which refers to the Congregation of Yisrael, (i.e. Malchut). So \"Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim\" refers to the daughter of Abraham the Patriarch, as it is written: \"A spring (Heb. gal), shut up\" (Shir Hashirim 4:12), 'springs' refer to the (upper) lights that gather, enter Malchut, and fill her. As has already been quoted: \"Your shoots are a garden of pomegranates\" (Ibid. 13).",

'Laish' is the masculine term; 'Laishah' is the feminine. \"Why is she called 'laish'? Is it because it is written: 'a lion which is strongest among beasts?\" (Proverbs 30:30). Or is it written to remind us that \"the lion perishes for lack of prey\"? All that is said refers to 'laish.' (Here, Malchut is called) the lower Gevurah, as she is drawn down from the upper Gevurah. But she is also \"the lion [who] perishes for lack of prey.\" When these streams depart and do not enter her, then she is called the 'laishah' (lioness), which perishes for lack of prey. As is written: \"The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the lion's whelps are scattered abroad\" (Job 4:11).",

(These indicate poverty) What does (King Solomon) want to teach us? As long as King David was alive, Evyatar became wealthy and prosperous. But after that, (when King David died, he became poor). Solomon told him, \"Anatot, to your own fields.\"",

He wanted to tell him, during your days, my father lived in poverty, but now \" go to your own fields.\" We should now explain why Evyatar was called Anatot. Should one assume that it was because he was from Anatot? We have already learned from the verse: \"And one of the sons of Achimelech, the son of Achituv, named Evyatar, escaped\" (I Sam. 22:20). And he came from Nov, the city of the priests. We have learned that Nov is also called Anatot and why is it called Anatot - because of the poverty and destitution to which it had been reduced by King Saul through the slaughter of all its priestly inhabitants. Nevertheless, Anatot was the name of a village and is not Nov. Rather, King Solomon called Evyatar Anatot, \"because you were afflicted (Heb. hit'anita) in all that my father was afflicted\" (I Kings 2:26) - and because he also came from the city of Nov. So the true reason is that, because King David lived in poverty in his days, he called him thus.",

As it is written, \"Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren\" (Gen. 9:25), and also \"you are cursed above all cattle\" (Gen. 3:14). When Abraham came close to the Holy One, blessed be He, it is written, \"And Hashem appeared to Abram\" (Gen. 12:7), now was revealed to him that which he did not know, because of the profound force that governed the land. Thus appeared to him what",
                "what had been concealed from him, and he was able to understand it....",
                "Then \"he built an altar to Hashem, who had appeared to him.\" Why were the words \"who had appeared to him\" added? Because here the grade, which was in dominion over the land, appeared to him. He entered it, rose through it, and was established in it.",
                "\"And he moved from there to the mountain\" (Gen. 12:8), where he recognized the mountain of Hashem and all the grades planted on that place. \"And pitched his tent\" (Heb. אָהֳלה) which alludes to the Nukva, as 'אָהֳלה' is not spelled with a Vav but with a Hei. Thus he spread a curtain and received the kingdom of heaven, along with all the grades that come from it. He then knew that the Holy One, blessed be He, rules over all, and he built an altar. There were actually two altars, because here the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared to him as the ruler over all. He now acquired knowledge of the supernal wisdom, which he had not previously attained. He therefore built two altars one for the grade that appeared and one to the grade still hidden.",
                "Come and behold, It is written first, \"and there he built an altar to Hashem, who had appeared to him,\" and later just \"and there he built an altar to Hashem,\" without adding \"who appeared to him.\" And all this is according to the secret of Wisdom.",
                "Abraham was then crowned from grade to grade, until he ascended to his own grade. This is the meaning of \"And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the Negev.\" This is the south, Abraham's portion. \"Going on still,\" grade after grade, until he reached the south, where he was properly attached. He then ascended to the south's grade, that is, he deserved to be a Chariot of Chesed of Zeir Anpin called 'south.'",
                "After Abraham was crowned with his grades in the Holy Land and entered the holy grade, that is, the grade of Chesed, and the aspect of the hidden world, then it is written, \"And there was famine in the land\" (Gen. 12:10), they were not sure how to approach the Holy One, blessed be He, as in the secret of the verse \"not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Hashem\" (Amos 8:11).",
                "\"And there was famine in the land\" because until then the power ruling over the land did not supply the land with strength and nourishment. This occurred because (the Nukvah) was not completely built and not established. When Abraham saw that the power appointed over the land did not supply it with might and holy strength as it merited, then \"Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there\" (Gen. 12:10).",
                "How did Abraham know (that the land still needed correction)? From the verse, \"To your seed I will give this land.\" Abraham then knew that the only way to amend the land was through the holy grades of his descendants. Abraham then understood the secret of Wisdom - the land will not be properly mended in holiness, except as we have said. He therefore went down to Egypt, from there to correct that which was lacking.",
                "Sitrei Torah The Holy One, blessed be He, alluded to the supernal Wisdom through Abraham and Isaac; Abraham is the Neshamah of Neshamah, (referred to as 'the light of Chayah'). Sarah is the Neshamah, and Lot is the serpent, the spouse of Samael. The holy Ruach is Isaac; the Holy Nefesh is Rivkah. The Evil Inclination is the bestial Nefesh. And concerning this King Solomon said in his wisdom, \"Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upwards, and the spirit of the beast goes downwards\" (Kohelet 3:21). The bestial Nefesh is the Nefesh that comes from the side of the Evil Inclination.",
                "And this is what they meant by saying that the Neshamah of Neshamah rests upon a person who feels awe and has Wisdom. The Neshamah reaches a person in Binah, as it is written, \"And to man He said, Behold the fear of Hashem, that is wisdom (Heb. חָכְמָה)\" (Iyov 28:28). The Neshamah comes to a person through repentance, which is called 'Binah' and 'Sarah'. The Ruach is called 'the voice', and is also called 'Da'at.' And this is drawn down to a person who raises his voice in Torah. (The Ruach is) also called the written Torah, and all the positive deeds come from the mental Nefesh.",
                "In a similar way, the Holy One, blessed be He, created the body from the four elements namely, Fire, Air, Earth and Water, which correspond to the Neshamah of Neshamah, the Neshamah, the Ruach, and the Nefesh. Water which is the aspect of the male refers to the sweet waters of holiness. The contrasting bitter waters represent the Evil Inclination. The holy fire which is the aspect of the female. There is the foreign fire, to which the words \"that he come not at all times to the holy place\" (Vayikra 16:2) apply. And this is the female of the Evil Inclination. The holy Ruach is the aspect of the Male, similar to the Ruach that comes from the Sefirah of Da'at. The unholy Ruach, which is the Evil Inclination. As it is written, \"for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a viper\" (Isaiah 14:29). There is holy Earth, similar to the Nefesh that comes from the left side of Da'at. And in contrast, there is an Unholy Earth.",
                "Therefore, the Neshamah, which is repentance, (Binah) attacks and overcomes the serpent by the power of enslavement that belongs to repentance. And it drags the serpent to the synagogue and the learning academies. And the four elements expand to 22 letters, Aleph-Chet-Hei-Ayin (throat); Bet-Vav-Mem-Pe (lips); Gimel-Yud-Caf-Kof (palate); Dalet-Tet-Lamed-Nun-Tav (tounge); Zayin-Samech-Shin-Resh-Tzadik from the teeth. [These five vowels of articulation of the mouth are equivalent to Keter, Chochmah, Binah, Tiferet, and Malchut, which are the four elements of Water, Fire, Air and Earth. This is why he says that the four elements, which are the secret of the five vowels of articulation of the mouth, expand to 22 letters]. (End of the Gilayon)",
                "The verse, \"And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem,\" alludes to the synagogue, the place where the Shechinah resides. As it is written, \"Moreover I have given to you one portion (Heb. שְׁ'כֶ'ם')\" (Gen. 48:22), (Shechem) is the Shechinah, which is fit for (Yosef), as he is called 'righteous.' Because righteousness (i.e. the Shechinah) does not reside anywhere else but in the righteous (Yosef). This is the meaning of \"to the place of Shechem,\" (i.e. the shul). \"To the plain of Moreh\" alludes to Torah-learning academies, where they teach and instruct Torah to the public.",
                "\"And the Canaanite was then in the land\" means that the Evil Inclination was sweetened and amended in spite of itself, in the body because it has many names. \"Was then in the land\" is certainly against its will. The serpent is not yet completely removed from the body. Therefore, because the body is still attached (to the serpent), the \"Canaanite was then in the land.\"",

If it has merit, it will rise up \"to the place of the altar, which he had made...\" Who is 'he' who 'had made,' and what is 'the altar'? \"He had made there\" applies to the Holy One, blessed be He, who had made that altar and established it upon twelve stones, \"according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of Hashem came, saying, Yisrael shall be your name\" (I Kings 18:31), for sure.",

As it is written, \"And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle (the soul) and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle, (the Evil Inclination)\" (Gen. 13:7). Because in this world, on each and every day, those camps and rulers from the side of the soul are in strife with the camps and rulers from the side of the body, and they fight with each other while all the parts of the body are trapped in agony between them, between the soul and the serpent, between those forces that fight each other every day.",
                "Thus it is written, \"And Abram said to Lot\" (Gen. 13:8) that the soul answered the Evil Inclination, \"Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen.\" Between my camps and your camps \"for we are brethren\"; because the Good Inclination and the Evil Inclination are close to each other, the one to man's right and the other to his left.",

As it is written, \"and pitched his tent toward Sodom,\" followed by, \"And the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinners before Hashem exceedingly\" (Gen. 13:13).

They number three hundred and eighteen - 248 limbs of the body and seventy that belong to the secret of the soul. The soul comes from (the Seven Sefirot of Zeir Anpin). He was armed with all these to confront those sinners to make them repent and atone for their sins.",

Nefesh is the force from which the body is built. When a man is aroused in this world to mate with his wife, all parts of the body agree on this and are prepared to receive enjoyment from it. Then the Nefesh and the desire of the person indulge willingly in that act. The Nefesh is drawn down and enters the sperm that comes forth....",

Why did the sea rage upon Jonah and not the earth? He was leaving the land, so that the Shechinah would not hover above him. If so, why did the sea seize him when he went away, and not the land from which he ran?",

Immediately, \"they took up Jonah, and cast him into the sea.\"",

If he is aroused below on the side of defilement, he draws upon himself the spirit of defilement and becomes unholy. Upon this, they said that whoever wishes to be defiled is defiled.",

But in \"the mountains of the east\" (Num. 23:7), in the land of the east, he learned the enchantments and kinds of magic, for in these mountains abide the angels Aza and Azael, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, caused to fall from heaven (because they denounced the creation of man).

He cast his spells to all directions in order to uproot the children of Yisrael, but could not do so.",

This side cleaves to them more than to men, because they come from strict Judgment. Everything is attached to and follows its own kind.",

Similarly, it behooves man to stay away from a woman during menstruation, because she is attached to the spirit of defilement. If she practices sorcery at that time, she will be more successful that at other times. Whatever she touches is therefore defiled, and all the more so whomever approaches her. Happy are the children of Yisrael, for the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them Torah, and told them, \"Also you shall not approach to a woman in the impurity of her menstrual flow, to uncover her nakedness...

Therefore, it was decreed that there is water that raises wise men and water that raises fools. This water that drops from Eden raises wise ones.",
                "As Rabbi Yosi said, So the water containing the drops comes from the most ancient of four rivers, as it is written, \"The name of the first is Pishon\" (Gen. 2:11). Why is it written, \"the name of the first is Pishon?\" Pishon is different from the rest because it flows into the land of Egypt. Therefore, the wisdom of Egypt is greater than that of the rest of the world.",
                "When it was decreed that the wisdom of Egypt was lost, the Holy One, blessed be He, took the drops and threw them across the garden into the river of the Garden of Eden, as it is written, \"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden\" (Gen. 2:10). And when the drops, which remain in the garden, were taken from Egypt, wisdom was gone from Egypt. It separated into four other rivers, of which the most special was Pishon. Wisdom was thus lost in Egypt when the drops were taken from Egypt and left in the garden.",
                "Every prophet was sucking from that spirit that came out of Eden. This is the meaning of \"walking in the garden in the breeze of the day\" (Gen. 3:8). It is stored in the Garden of Eden for the future. This is the river that Ezekiel saw in his prophecy. Therefore the scripture reads, \"For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Hashem\" (Isaiah 11:9), as this water always causes the knowledge in the world to increase."

                "The sages said that the souls of all the righteous are above in Eden, and wisdom is strengthened in the world because of what descends from Eden. How much more so for every one of those who stand in it and take their fill of its pleasure and brightness.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, If the soul deserves to pass through the gates of the terrestrial Jerusalem, the great angel Michael hastens to greet and walk with it. The ministering angels wonder about this and ask, \"Who is that, coming up from the wilderness\" (Shir Hashirim 8:5). Who rises to be among the high ones from the destroyed body, which resembles a breath, as is written, \"Man is like a breath\" (Tehilim 144:4)? He answers by saying, \"My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is distinguished she is the only one of her mother\" (Shir Hashirim 6:9). Her mother is the Throne of Glory, a mother for the soul that gives it birth, for the soul is derived from her.",
                "\"The daughters saw her, and called her happy\" (Ibid.). This refers to the other souls, whose rank is high and who are called the daughters of Jerusalem. According to Rabbi Yosi, they are called the daughters of Jerusalem while the other ones are called the daughters of Lot. \"The daughters saw her, the rest of the souls praise it and say to it, Come in peace. \"The queens and the concubines praised her\" (Ibid.). The queens are the Patriarchs that are queens. The concubines are the proselytes. They all praise and laud it until it enters above. Then the soul is in its ascended place, and longevity is maintained, as it is written, \"And Abraham was old, advanced in age (lit. 'coming into the days')\" (Gen. 24:1), as he entered longevity in the World to Come.",
                "Rabbi Abba Saba (the elder) stood up and said, May peace and tranquillity come to you, Rabbi Shimon, the son of Yochai, for restoring the diadem to its former splendor. For we learned in the first Mishnah that since the soul is perfected in the supernal place, it does not return to the body. It remains in the same condition, but other souls are created and come out of it. Then Rabbi Shimon, the son of Yochai, taught that although this world is vanity and the body is a putrid drop of semen, yet the soul enters it. In the future, when everyone will be refined and the body will be more pure, sustained and complete, there will be no reason for the soul to enter it with all its completeness.",
                "Rabbi Acha said, The Holy One, blessed be He, will give the very soul and very body existence in the future, but both will be whole and have completeness of knowledge so they can achieve what they did not achieve in this world.",
                "\"And Abraham was old, advanced in age (lit. 'coming with the days').\" Rabbi Bo said that, according to Rabbi Yochanan, this refers to the world of days and not to that world which is night. Rabbi Ya'akov said those worlds are called days because of all the pleasures and the brightness that he inherits. \"And Hashem had blessed Abraham in all\" (Gen. 24:1) refers to the office that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him of His name, which is the letter Hei by which the world was created.",
                "We learned that Rabbi Yochanan said, Metatron, the great minister, is a boy, a servant whose Rabbi, his master, rules him. He is in charge of the soul and gives it daily of the light he was ordered to give it. In the future, he will receive an account in writing from the cemetery, from Dumah for each body that he can show to his Master. He will turn that backbone into yeast to build the body under the ground, to mend and wholly revive the body, a body without a soul. Later, the Holy One, blessed be He, will send the soul to its place. This will be after it comes to the land of Yisrael.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, it is then written, \"And Abraham said to the eldest servant of his house, that ruled...\" (Gen. 24:2). If we look at this from the aspect of wisdom, what is \"his servant\"? Rabbi Nehorai responded, We need look only at the words \"his servant\", the servant of Hashem, close to His worship. Who is he? He is Metatron, who will beatify the body in the grave, as we have said.",
                "Thus the words, \"And Abraham said to his eldest servant\" refer to Metatron, the servant of Hashem. The phrase, \"The eldest servant of his house\" is the beginning of the creations of Hashem. \"That ruled over all that he had\" means that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him power over all His hosts, namely over the upper angels.",
                "We learned that Rabbi Shimon quoted Rabbi Yosi who quoted Rav saying that all the hosts of the servant receive light and delight in the splendor of the soul, as the light of the soul in the World to Come is greater than the light of the throne. It seems that the soul was taken from the throne, each had according to what was appropriate for it. Rav Nachman added that it is actually greater than the light of the throne, as it is written, \"The likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it\" (Ezekiel 1:26), above it in splendor.",
                "When he goes to perform the errand (of Hashem), all his hosts and his Chariot are nourished by that splendor of the oul. And the soul says to him, \"Put...your hand\" namely, your escort, \"under my thigh\" (Gen. 24:2). This is the light that flows from the soul.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda the son of Rabbi Shalom said that we have been taught that when he goes on an errand for the Holy One, blessed be He, He moves His upper hosts by one letter of His name, namely by the letter Yud of the name Yud Hev Vav Hei. Hei is the secret of Imma and Abba, the root of the soul's light. Rav Huna said, Yerechi ('my thigh') has the same numerical value as ram (lit. 'high'), which is what the soul says, that is, \"Put...your hand,\" your escort, under the grade of the high and elevated, that rules over all. After the soul commanded the escort of high ones to be under Him, it told him I make you swear a great oath.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, It is written, \"Elohim of the heaven, and Elohim of the earth\" (Ezekiel 1:26). Since he already mentioned Hashem, why add \"Elohim of the heaven? Rabbi Yehuda said, to show that He is Master over everything simultaneously. In one instant, He moves everything, and everything is nothing compared to Him, heaven and earth in the oath, which is the secret of the letter Yud, which indicates that this light governs all the grades and everything is as naught compared to it. Rabbi Yitzchak said that by two letters of His name He moves His whole hosts. This is to show that He is all, and there is nothing save Him.",
                "\"And I will make you swear by Hashem, Elohim of the heaven...\" Ran Huna said, If he had been with those versed in the Baraita at the time that they revealed the secret of this verse, he would not have left them without knowing everything, for he saw great depth in their utterances. They revealed much, but man does not understand what they revealed. Come and behold, The soul causes to swear this oath of the covenant, as it is written, \"That you shall not take a wife to my son\" (Gen. 24:3).",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, from here, it is understood that the soul said to Metatron, Because you are going on this mission to resurrect the dead, \"you shall not take a wife for my son.\" This means you shall not take a body for my son. He cannot enter another body, an idolatrous body, a body not worthy of him, but only the body which is actually my own, the very one I came from. And this is what is meant by the verse, \"But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred\" (Ibid. 4).",
                "Rabbi Yosi said, What is meant by the verse, \"And take a wife to my son Isaac\"? Rabbi Yitzchak replies, The very body that suffered with me in that world and had no pleasure or content for fear of its Possessor (this refers to the Luz bone). This very body shall you take to laugh with, in that rejoicing of the righteous, to take delight in it in the joy of the Holy One, blessed be He. Have pleasure with it, because it is time for laughter, as it is written, \"Then was our mouth filled with laughter\" (Tehilim 126:2).",
                "Rabbi Yehudah, the son of Rabbi Yitzchak, said, Come and listen, An angel does only one errand, not two at the same time. There are, however, two errands to perform, to resurrect the body in the grave and to make it rise to the land of Yisrael, where the soul will be enclothed in it. But one angel does not perform two errands. Rabbi Abba said, There is one angel with an inkstand at his waist. (Gabriel) He will put a mark on the brow of each. Afterward, the great minister (Metatron) will go and mend each one, preparing it to receive its soul. This is the meaning of the verse, \"He shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife\" (Gen. 24:7). What is meant by \"before you\"? It indicates that (Hashem will send an angel) before your errand.",
                "Rabbi Eliezer went to see his Rabbi, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai, on the first day of the month. When he arrived he told him, 'O Well for those who see, filled with drawn water, yet gushing more from its own source. What does it seek here?'",
                "He answers, It behooves a man to greet his Rabbi (on Rosh Chodesh). He said to him, Not for that reason I said. I see in your face that there is a new deep secret about which you are going to ask.",
                "He said to him, I see that primordial light travels by ten and conducts everything according to the secret of ten. We learned that there are ten writings, ten keys to the hospital in its hands. It takes these and ten notes in the Garden of Eden to mend the earth for the bodies of the righteous.",
                "He said, Eliezer my son, you have seen more than a holy angel. The world, is created by ten, and it is conducted by ten. The holy throne is according to ten. The Torah is by ten. Its traveling is by ten. The supernal worlds are by ten. And there is the supernal one above them all, blessed be He.",
                "I will tell you something else. Those versed in the Mishnah put some thought into it, as it is written, \"And the servant took ten camels\" (Gen. 42:10). R' Eliezer said to him, Master, I know this verse, but what is the meaning of, \"For all the goods of his master were in his hands\" (Ibid.)? He said to him, This is the name of his Master (the Shechinah) that went with him to bring him and to protect him. R' Eliezer said, Assuredly this is \"For My name was in him\" (Shemot 23:21).",
                "Rabbi Abahu said, Come and behold, He who knows His name perfectly knows that He and his Name are one. The Holy One, blessed be He, and His Name are one, as it is written, \"Hashem shall be one, and his Name One\" (Zecharyah 14:9). That is, the name and He are one.",
                "Rabbi Abba said, We should look at the verse, \"And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water\" (Gen. 24:11). According to Rabbi Abba, outside the city means in the cemetery. \"By a well of water\" refers, as we learnt, that those who are the first (to be revived) in the cemetery, are those who dealt in Torah. As we have learned, when a man comes into his grave, he is first asked if he set appointed times to study Torah, as it is written, \"And he shall be the faith of your times\" (Isaiah 33:6). Without question, he who responds yes, is revived first.",
                "Rabbi Abba said that \"at the time of evening\" (Gen. 24:11) refers to Friday, Shabbat eve, the time of the resurrection of the dead. What is the meaning? We have learned that the world exists for 6,000 years and that Erev Shabbat is the 6th millennium, the ending of all. Thus \"at the time of evening\" means the time of ending for everything. The phrase, \"At the time that the women go out to draw water\" refers to the scholars of the Torah, who draw the water of Torah, the time to go out and shake off the dust.",
                "Rabbi Abba added that there is more to know, as we have learned that those occupied in knowing their Master in this world and their soul to perfection in the World to Come, deserve to get out of the grave by the oath of the soul. (Metatron) comes to know which is the soul's proper body and it is written, \"Behold, I stand here by the well of water\" (Gen. 24:43). Although it is the scholar of the Torah, (Metatron goes)to look for perfection, as it is written, \"And it shall come to pass, that the maid who comes forth to draw, and I say to her, 'Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher'\" (Ibid. 44), which means 'tell me by hint, the knowledge of the name, from what you conceived'.",
                "\"And she says to me, 'Both drink you'\" (Gen. 24:44). (She knows three things) You are a servant like me; The knowledge of you does not compare with the knowledge of Hashem, blessed be He; It behooves you to conceive that you are a creature like me.",
                "\"I will draw water for your camels also\" (Gen. 24:19) indicates that it also drew forth for his attendants from what it perceived. The words \"your camels\" means \"your retinue.\" In other words, my understanding is that: 1) Your retinue was not aware; 2) \"I know that I have an advantage over you\"; 3) I know how you were created from the radiance that was placed with you. If the body mentions (all of these) let this sign be delivered to me. Then I shall know she is the woman. She is the body from the same soul according to the oath it made me swear.",
                "\"And it came to pass, before he had done speaking\" (Gen. 24:15). According to Rabbi Yitzchak, Rabbi Yehudah said while he was thinking of how to try the body, it is written, \"Behold, Rivkah came out,\" which is the holy body that is occupied in Torah. It pounds the body for knowledge of the conception of his Possessor, \"who was born to Betuel\" (Ibid.). Rav Yehuda said she was the daughter (Heb. bat) of El, the \"son of Milkah\" (Ibid.), who is a son to the king (Heb. Malkah) of the universe. \"The wife of Nachor, Abraham's brother\" alludes to the company of the mind, the body attached to the mind, and is the brother of the soul, and the phrase, \"With her pitcher upon her shoulder\" alludes to the weight of wisdom upon it.",
                "\"And the servant ran to meet her\" (Gen. 24:17) refers to Metatron. And said, \"Let me, I pray you, drink a little water of your pitcher\" give me a hint of the wisdom of the knowledge of your Maker that you dealt with in the world you left. Rabbi Abba said, We have explained that after that it is written, \"And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands\" (Ibid. 47). Rabbi Abba said that these are the bones that were scattered here and there. He puts them together and weighs them one upon the other, as is written, \"And strengthen your bones\" (Isaiah 58:11). Rabbi Abba said, At that time, the body stands in the land of Yisrael, where the soul enters it.",
                "Rabbi Yochanan asks, Who conducts the body to the land of Yisrael? Rabbi Zeira said, The Holy One, blessed be He, digs caverns under the ground and they roll to the land of Yisrael. Hence it is written, \"And the earth shall cast out the shades of the dead\" (Isaiah 26:19).",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, Gabriel conducts them to the land of Yisrael. How do we know that? From the verse, \"Will you go with this man?\" (Gen. 24:58). Elsewhere, it is written, \"The man Gabriel\" (Daniel 9:21). Rabbi Yosi asks, Why is it written, \"And Rivkah had a brother and his name was Laban\" (Ibid. 29)? Rabbi Yitzchak answered, The Evil Inclination does not pass away from the world, and though it is not entirely present, some of it is.",
                "Come and behold, When it was in this world, it was called Lot. In the World to Come, it will be partly canceled and called Laban, its not as corrupt as before, but as one who washed the filth off of himself. Why is there need of Laban? Rabbi Shimon said, It is needed for being fruitful and multiply. If there is no Evil Inclination, nothing is fruitful or multiplies.",
                "Come and listen, Since the body was constructed and established, why is it then written, \"And they sent away Rivkah, their sister, and her nurse...\" (Gen. 24:59). What does the phrase \"and her nurse\" imply? It is the power of movement. Rabbi Yitzchak further clarifies this by explaining that this is the power of the body.",
                "Rabbi Abahu opened with the verse, \"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon...\" (Shir Hashirim 4:8). Rabbi Abahu said, Once the body was built and established, it is brought to the land of Yisrael to receive its soul. The soul awaits it there and comes out to greet it, as is written, \"And Isaac went out to meditate in the field\" (Gen. 24:63). \"Come with me from Lebanon, my bride\" is the soul, and \"Look from the top of Amana\" (Ibid.) corresponds to, \"And he lifted his eyes and saw\" (Ibid.).",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, If this is the soul, Abraham is satisfactory, as was said. What then is Isaac? Rabbi Abahu said, The friends said it is now called Isaac because of the increased joy in the world.",
                "Rabbi Abahu said, First the soul was called Abraham and the body Sarah. Now the soul is called Isaac and the body Rivkah. Rabbi Shimon said, It was taught in the Mishnah that the soul awaited the body in the land of Yisrael forty years before the body existed. Where? At the Temple.",
                "Rabbi Abahu said, Look at the verse, \"And took Rivkah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death\" (Gen. 24:67). When he loves the body and is comforted by it, it is time for laughter and delight in the world.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, Now this whole portion of the scripture is made clear, but I do not know the meaning of the verse, \"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah\" (Gen. 25:1). To a reasonable mind, this text is contradictory. It contradicts the explanation concerning the soul and body at the time of resurrection.",
                "Rav Dimi arrived and said, I have heard an explanation for this portion, but I do not remember it. They said that the high and strong did not present it for revelation. What have we to say? Rabbi Yehudah stood up and said that the portion is revealed in the Yeshivah of our friends, the sages of the Mishnah.",
                "They stood up and began walking, he, Rabbi Yeesa, and Rabbi Chiya. They found Rabbi Elazar ben Rabbi Shimon, who was revealing the secret of Tefilin. They came before him and asks, Master, what are you engaged in? He replies, I am recounting the reason for the Tefilin, for blessed is the man who dons Tefilin and knows the sense thereof.",
                "They said, If it is well before you, Master, may you tell us something. They said, We learned from your father that the Holy One, blessed be He, in His great love for the children of Yisrael, told them to build Him a tabernacle, reflecting the supernal high Chariot, so He might come and dwell among them. This is the meaning of, \"And let them make Me a sanctuary, so that I may dwell among them\" (Shemot 25:8). We learned from your father that the reason for the Tefilin was hidden in this verse.",
                "He said to them, Come and behold, The Temple was made to reflect the upper one in its holy Chariots. And then the Holy One, blessed be He, caused His Shechinah to dwell among them. In this manner, those versed in the Mishnah discussed the reason for the Tefilin. Any man who wears tefilin will be patterned after the upper Chariots, the lower Chariot and the upper Chariot so that His kingdom will come and the Shechinah will dwell upon him.",
                "We learned that there are deep secrets in the tefilin and its patterns. There are three Chariots within them, like the high and holy ones, reflecting the secrets of the three letters of His Holy Name. For these three Chariots are the three letters YUD-HEI-VAV. The four sections govern the four letters of His Holy Name. This is therefore the secret of the Shin of three crowns and Shin of four crowns, the three kings ruling over the body and the Tefilin upon the Holy One, blessed be He, above the head Tefilin and the hand Tefilin, four sections, which correspond to the Shin with four heads.",
                "Similarly, the heart rides as if on the lower Chariot. And the lower one is mounted. We have also learned that this Chariot of the arm, is below. The heart rides as if beneath. It was given to it to bring in all the heavenly hosts. So the heart rides down below and all the limbs of the body are given to it.",
                "Above the heart are the four sections of the brain. The Holy One, blessed be He, is supreme ruler over them. He is King of all. And the secret of wisdom resembles the Temple, as it is written, \"And make one Cherub on the one end, and the other Cherub on the other end\" (Shemot 25:19). Above them is the King's Shechinah, within the four letters Yud Hev Vav Hei. Yud-Hei is on the right Cherub, and Vav-Hei on the left cherub. Within the two Chariots, the upper Chariot is on the right Cherub and the lower Chariot is on the left Cherub.",
                "Similarly, the heart and the brain, the heart is on one side and the brain on the other side. Upon them is the King's Shechinah in four sections. Rabbi Elazar said, From now on, the secrets of the crowns of the letters, the sections in their bodies and the straps are an ancient tradition that Moses received in Sinai. They were already explained by allusion and the sense of all this is in the secret of the thirteen divine attributes.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, Even if we came only for this secret, it would have sufficed. They said to him, Happy is your lot in the World to Come, for no secret is withheld from you. They said to him, We came before you, Master, to know the secret of the verse, \"Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah\" (Gen. 25:1).",
                "He said, the explanation of this verse is revealed by the friends versed in the Mishnah. When the soul enters its holy body, these words will be said of the wicked, who will be resurrected and make better their deeds. And the soul will grant them its precious splendor, so they will know, repent and have full merit again.",
                "When Solomon saw this, he wondered very much, and said, \"And so I saw the wicked buried, and come to their rest...gone from the holy place\" (Kohelet 8:10). Rabbi Abba quoted Rabbi Yochanan, saying it is written, \"Can the Kushite change his skin, or the leopard his spots?\" (Jer. 13:23), similarly the wicked who did not deserve to repent in this world and offer good deeds as sacrifices will never burn sacrifices in the World to Come. It is written, \"Then again Abraham took a wife\" and wanted to produce a soul for their bodies and bring them closer in repentance, as it is written, \"And the souls that they had made in Charan\" (Gen. 12:5).",
                "Rabbi Elazar said, Look at the verse, \"And she bore him Zimran, and Yokshan\" (Gen. 25:2). They did many evil deeds, until they were driven from the world, as it is written, \"And sent them away from his son Isaac\" (Ibid.). Of them it is written, \"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake...\" (Daniel 12:2). Of the others, it is written, \"And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament\" (Ibid. 3).",

'the well of living and seeing')\" (Gen. 25:11). Through the knowledge of the living, the life of the world, he may know and conceive what he had not conceived in this world, as it is written, \"For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Hashem\" (Isaiah 11:9).

Come and behold, When the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, He took the dust from the place of the Temple and built his body from the four directions of the world, each of which gave him strength. Later, He poured the spirit of life upon him, as it is written, \"And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life\" (Gen. 2:7). Then he stood up and knew that he comprised both high and low; he cleaved to Hashem and knew the supernal wisdom.",

When all those who know how to properly sanctify themselves in this world beget a child, they draw on it a Holy Spirit from that place where all that is holy originates. These are called children to the Holy One, blessed be He, because their bodies were properly made in sanctity. He is also given a spirit from the holy supernal place, as he deserves. This has already been explained.",

This is according to the verse, \"The dead men of your people shall live, my dead body shall arise\" (Isaiah 26:19). The same soul is stored before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it returns to its proper place after death according to its deeds, as it is written, \"And the spirit returns to Elohim who gave it.\" At that time, He will revive the dead and pour dew from His head upon them. All the bodies will be resurrected from the dust by that dew.",

The reason is that it is written now Shma refering to the male, and now Shim'ah refering to the female.

But since she was only three years old, how can she be praised for her actions? Rabbi Yehuda replied that although she was only three years old, she can be judged by how she behaved toward the servant. This must mean that she had the wisdom of a twenty year old, and therefore she may be praised for not learning from what they did.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, Though she acted wisely toward the servant, I do not yet know if her behavior was right or not. Rather, Come and behold, it is written, \"Like the rose among thorns, so is my love among the daughters\" (Shir Hashirim 2:2). The rose is the congregation of Yisrael which is among the legions as a rose among the thorns. The hidden meaning is that Isaac came from the side of Abraham, supernal Chesed, who is kind to all creatures. And although he represented Severe Judgment, (he draws Chesed from Abraham). Rivkah also came from the side of Harsh Judgment (of Bethuel and Laban). Although she was herself of Weak Judgment and a thread of Chesed was attached to her, nevertheless she came from Severe Judgment. Thus, because Isaac was severe in his judgment and Rivkah was softer in her Judgment, she was as a rose among the thorns. If she were not of Weak Judgment, the world would not have been able to bear the Harsh Judgment of Isaac. In this manner, the Holy One, blessed be He, joins couples in the world, the severe with the weak, so as to balance everything, and the world would be sweetened."

                "Rabbi Yehuda continued with the verse, \"And Isaac entreated Hashem for his wife\" (Gen. 25:21). What is the meaning of \"entreated?\" That he offered a sacrifice and prayed for her. What offering did he sacrifice? A burnt offering. He sacrificed by studying the verses \"and Hashem was entreated of him\" (Ibid.), and \"So Hashem was entreated for the land\" (II Shmuel 24:25). There it means that a sacrifice has been offered, here too it means, a sacrifice has been offered. It is written, \"And Isaac entreated,\" \"and Hashem was entreated\", a celestial fire that came to meet the lower fire.",
                "Another explanation for, \"And Isaac entreated,\" is that by his prayer he hollowed out a passage that reached above to Mazal that bestows children. It is upon that place that giving birth to children depends, as it is written, \"and she prayed to (lit. 'above') Hashem\" (I Shmuel 1:10). Then, \"Hashem was entreated of him.\" Do not pronounce it \"entreated\" (Heb. וַיֵּעָתֶר), but \"hollowed out\" (Heb. וַיֵּחָתֶר). For the Holy One, blessed be He, cleared the way and accepted the prayer. Then, \"Rivkah his wife conceived.\"",
                "Come and behold, Isaac was with his wife for twenty years, but she did not give birth until he had said his prayer. This is because the Holy One, blessed be He, desires the prayer of the righteous, when they ask Him in prayer for their needs. Why? Because the anointing oil will be increased by the prayer of the righteous for all those in need of it.",
                "Come and behold, Abraham did not pray before the Holy One, blessed be He, so that He would give him sons, even though Sarah was barren. And although it may be said that he prayed, saying, \"Behold, to me You gave no seed,\" (Gen. 15:3) it is not a prayer, but simply a statement to his Master. But Isaac prayed for his wife because he knew that his wife, and not he, was sterile. And although Isaac knew by the inner meaning of wisdom that Jacob was bound to come from him and produce the twelve tribes, he did not know whether this would be from this wife or from another. Therefore the scripture reads, \"for his wife\" (Gen. 25:21), and not specifically \"for Rivkah.\"",
                "Rabbi Yehuda's son asks, Why then did not Isaac love Jacob as he loved Esau, if he knew that he would sire the twelve tribes? He replied, Well said. He loved Esau better because everyone loves and is attracted to his own kind.",
                "Come and behold, Esau was born all red, as it is written, \"And the first came out red all over\" (Gen. 25:25). Thus, he is the same as Isaac, who is of Harsh Judgment above, (in Holiness) and Esau, who issued from him, is the Harsh Judgment below. He resembled Isaac. And because each is drawn to his own kind, Isaac loved Esau more than Jacob, as it is written, \"And Isaac loved Esau, he relished his venison\" (Ibid. 28). Here it is written, \"For he relished his venison,\" which is similar to, \"wherefore it is said, 'like Nimrod the mighty hunter before Hashem'\" (Gen. 10:9).

Where did she go? To the academy of Shem and Ever. \"the children struggled together within her,\" because the wicked Esau was warring against Jacob there. The term 'struggle' (Heb. וַיִּתְרֹצֲצוּ) is similar to the expression 'to break' (Heb. רָצַץ) one's head, for they struggled and were divided. Come and behold, Esau was of the side of he who rides the serpent, (Samael) while JACOB was of the side who rides the perfect Holy Throne, of the side of the sun, that is united with the moon.",

As it is written, \"the serpent was craftier\" (Gen. 3:1), which means that he was cunning (and sly). What Jacob did with Esau was serpent-like. This was as it ought to have been; by making Esau go after that serpent, so that he would be separated from Jacob, and thus share nothing with him in this world or in the World to Come. Thus we learn, \"he who comes to kill you, hasten to kill him first.\" It is written, \"in the womb he took his brother\" (Hoshea 12:4), which means that he lowered him down by the heel. This is the meaning of, \"and his hand took hold of Esau's heel\" (Gen. 25:26), for he put his hands on the heel to subjugate him.",
                "Another explanation of the verse, \"and his hand took hold\" is that Jacob could not be separated from him entirely, so his hand held the heel of Esau. His hand is the moon whose light was darkened because he held Esau's heel. Therefore, Jacob needed to be clever with him, to push him down, so he would cleave to his place.",

But \"Did he not rightly call him \"Jacob?' for he has supplanted me (Heb. יַּעַקְבֵנִי)?\" (Ibid.). Surely the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that the primordial serpent was wise in an evil way.

'him') El the Elohim Yisrael\" (Gen. 33:20). This is the Holy One, blessed be He, who called Jacob 'El'. He said to him: 'I am El among the upper, and you are El among the lower.'",

As a result, in all that Esau did, he acted as slyly and crookedly, just like another just like another tortuous serpent. This is as it ought to be. This agrees with the words of Rabbi Shimon, \"And Elohim created the great crocodiles,\" which refer to Jacob and Esau, \"and every living creature that moves\" (Gen. 1:21), refers to the levels between them. By necessity, Jacob needed to behave wisely against the other serpent. This is as it must be.",

In addition, a he goat should be sacrificed on Yom Kippur. This is done with wisdom, so as to control the serpent, so that he can not do evil. This is the meaning of the verse: \"and the goat (Heb. שָּׂעִיר) shall bear upon it all their iniquities\" (Vayikra 16:22). This refers to Esau, who is hairy (Heb. שָּׂעִיר). All of this was done wisely and cleverly. Why? Because it is written, \"and with the perverse you will show yourself subtle\" (Tehilim 18:27). This is the evil serpent, the tortuous spirit, wise in wickedness, who accuses above and incites below.",

Therefore Jacob, who is imbued with the true Faith, treated Esau in all that he did so that there would be no place for that serpent to defile the Temple, or approach it and thereby rule the world. Thus, Abraham did not need to behave slyly, and neither did Isaac. For Esau, who was on the side of the serpent, had not yet come into the world. But Jacob, the landlord, had to stand against that serpent to prevent him from ruling and defiling the Temple of Jacob. Therefore, Jacob had to (fight him) more (cleverly) than the rest of the people in the world.

Another explanation is that these mandrakes are the Angels of Peace. \"give a fragrance\" refers to souls, the fragrance of the world; \"give\" means to allow, as it is written, \"and Sichon would not allow Yisrael\" (Num. 21:23).",

Rabbi Zeira said, The Holy One, blessed be He, used all kinds of enticements to encourage the children of Yisrael to return to the good path. The greatest of them all was when He said to them, \"and you shall eat your bread to the full,\" or among the curses, the worst is, \"and you shall eat, and not be satisfied\" (Ibid. 26). Why so? Because it is written, \"Would we had died by the hand of Hashem in the land of Egypt\" (Shemot 16:3). Rabbi Zeira said, This teaches us that for the sake of eating, they sacrificed their lives to die by their hands. When the Holy One, blessed be He, noticed their lust, He said to them: \"If you will hearken to keep the commandments, you shall eat your bread to the full', (Lev. 26:5) in order to appease their minds.

Forty years before the body is resurrected, the soul awaits it in the land of Yisrael. In the fortieth year, the bodies will rise from the dust.

Also, the time of the Redemption of Yisrael is during the fortieth year. During the fiftieth year, the world, which is Jubilee, will be populated. The return of the soul to the body occurs after forty years of waiting in the land of Yisrael.

Their passion and longing at that moment was for the splendor of the Shechinah only and to nourish of Her splendor.

The first is the liver and the second is the heart.

                "Why did they struggle? Because the Evil Inclination was abolished from the heart. \"Struggled.\" It should have been written, 'And they were at peace'. Rav Huna explained that \"struggled\" means that the strength and vigor were broken. Rabbi Yehuda asks, What does the body say then? The body asks, 'If it be so, why am I thus?' and 'Why was I created?' Immediately, \"she went to inquire of Hashem\" (Gen. 25:22).",
                "\"And Hashem said to her, 'Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples'\" (Gen. 25:23). These are the two proud ones, the liver and the heart. Rabbi Yosi said that these are the brain and the heart, but Rabbi Yehuda said, The brain is not included in this, for it is written, \"in your womb (lit. 'belly'),\" and the brain is not in the belly, but in the head. \"And two peoples from your bowels and the elder (lit. 'great') shall serve the younger.\" This is the liver, which is great and big, and which serves the heart, as Rabbi Yehuda said, The liver receives the blood, and serves it to the heart!",
                "\"And the first came out red\" (Gen. 25:21). Rav Kahana explained that the liver is the first and is red. Why is it red? Because it is first to swallow the blood. Rabbi Eliezer asks, Why is it called 'first'? Because it is the first to swallow the blood from all the food; the first in blood but not in creation. And why is it that \"the great shall serve the younger?\" Because despite its being greater and bigger in size than the heart, it serves the heart. Rabbi Abba then asks, What is the purpose of this text if not to teach the people in the world that though there will be perfection upon earth, the path and nature of the world will not change? Rabbi Yisa said, Come and behold. The liver hunts and has venison in its mouth, while the heart contemplates and is \"dwelling in tents\" (Ibid. 27). As it is written, \"And Jacob cooked pottage\" (Ibid. 29), while thinking deep thoughts and occupying himself with the Torah.",
                "\"And Jacob cooked pottage.\" In the name of Rabbi Acha, Rabbi Ba said that the nature of the world never changes. Come and behold, it is written, \"And Jacob cooked pottage (Heb. נָזִיד),\" as in the verse \"they dealt (Heb. זָדוּ)\" (Shemot 18:11), which was translated into Aramaic as \"they thought.\" It means that the heart thinks of and contemplates Torah, which represents the knowledge of its Creator. Thus, it is written, \"and Esau came from the field, and he was faint\" (Beresheet 25:29). It is the nature of the liver to go out hunting and swallow with its mouth. If it does not find any prey, it becomes tired and says to the heart, 'Before you think of the words of Torah, think of eating and drinking to nourish your body.' This is the meaning of the verse, \"and Esau said to Jacob 'Give me to swallow, I pray you, of that red pottage,'\" for it is my way to swallow the blood and transmit it to the other parts; \"for I am faint,\" without food and drink. And the heart replies, 'Give me the first and choicest of whatever you swallow, give me your birthright,' this is the meaning of \"Sell me this day your birthright\" (Ibid. 31). That is, swear by your desire. As the heart contemplates food, the liver swallows. If it were not for the heart, longing and thinking about food, the liver and other organs would not be able to swallow. As Rabbi Yosi said, This is the way of slaves, who do not to eat before their master.",
                "Rabbi Yosi said, It is later written, \"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils\" (Beresheet 25:34). What are these lentils? They are round as a circle, and as the circle which revolves around the world does not deviate from its path, so man in that time will never deviate from his. Although there will yet be all that is good and precious and perfect, with all that, the worldly habit of eating and drinking will not change."

At the end of forty years, when the troubles pass away and the wicked are exterminated, the dead, the dwellers of the dust, shall live. Why? Because it is written, \"affliction shall not rise up the second time\" (Nehemiah 1:9). They had their fill with what they had.

This was well said, but I see a longer time for the dwellers of the dust, who shall wait until the four hundred and eighth year of the sixth millennium, when they will rise. For this reason, the companions were stimulated by the verse that referred to the dwellers of the dust as the children of Chet, for Chet alludes to their rising after four hundred and eight (Heb. Chet Tav) years. As it is written, \"In the year of this Jubilee you shall return every man to his possession\" (Vayikra 25:13), when this (Heb. hazot) shall be finished. [The numerical value of Hazot is 5,408, as the Hei of Hazot alludes to the Hei (= 5) thousands; and Zot is 408 in numerical value]. Then, \"you shall return every man to his possession,\" means that the body will return to its soul, which is its possession and lot.",

The completely righteous will rise with the resurrection of the dead of the land of Yisrael a few years earlier, namely, at the fortieth year after the gathering of the exiles.

Rabbi Yehuda replied, By two hundred and ten years. Rabbi Yitzchak said, Resh Dalet Yud ('210') years, as it is written, \"Out of Jacob shall come (Heb. Yerd, Yud Resh Dalet) a ruler\" (Num. 24:19). This indicates that the Righteous precede other men by two hundred and ten years. Rav Nachman said, Precedence depends on how much the body is worn in the dust.

And Esau said (he went to the field) to pray. He hunted (and cheated Isaac) through his mouth, as it is written, \"He relished his venison (lit. there was venison in his mouth).\" He was called \"a man of the field,\" because his lot was not in a populated place, but in a desolate place, in the open wilderness, in the field.

This has already been explained. It refers to the resurrection of the dead, the fact that the Holy One blessed be He, will revive the dead and fix man's bones as they were at first, in a whole body.

Another explanation is that once Jacob wore them, they emitted an aroma. As long as Isaac did not smell the aroma of the garments, he did not bless him.

The difference between the language of Esau and Jacob is that Jacob did not want to frighten him. Thus, he spoke humbly, saying \"arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison.\" Esau, however, said \"Let my father arise,\" as if he was not speaking to him.",
                "Come and behold, When Esau entered, Gehenom came with him, and Isaac trembled with fear, as it is written, \"And Isaac trembled very much\" (Beresheet 27:33). Why is \"very much\" used to describe \"trembled.\"? Isaac never felt such fear and terror during his life. Even when he was strapped upon the altar and saw the knife, he did not tremble as when Esau entered and brought Gehenom with him. Then he said, \"Before you came, and have blessed him? Moreover, he shall be blessed.\" For I saw the Shechinah approving those blessings.",
                "There is another explanation, Isaac said, \"And has blessed him.\" A voice came forth, saying \"moreover, he shall be blessed.\" Isaac wanted to curse Jacob, but the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, Isaac, it is you whom you curse, for you have said to him \"cursed be those that curse you, and blessed be those that bless you\" (Beresheet 27:29).",
                "Come and behold, Everyone acknowledged these blessings, the upper and lower, and even he, (Samael, the angel-minister of Esau) the part and portion of Esau, acknowledged them. And he blessed him and approved of the blessings, and raised him above his head.",
                "From where do we know this? From the verse, \"And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, unless you bless me\" (Beresheet 32:27). It is written, \"And he said, Let me go\" because Jacob had seized him. How can a man, flesh and blood, take hold of an angel, which is pure spirit, as it is written, \"who makes the winds His messengers; the flames of fire His ministers\" (Tehilim 104:4)?",
                "It is understood from this that when angels, the messengers of the Holy One, blessed be He, descend into this world, they are clothed in a body in the likeness of this world, for it is not seemly to deviate from the custom of the place one visits.",
                "We have learned that when Moses went up, \"he was there with Hashem forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water\" (Shemot 34:28) in order not to deviate from the custom of the place he went to. And of the angels, when they descended, it is written, \"and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate\" (Beresheet 18:8). Here also, the descending angel could not struggle with Jacob unless clothed in a body, as is done in this world. Therefore Jacob wrestled with him the whole night. But if he were not clothed (in human form), Jacob could not have wrestled with him.",
                "Come and behold, Because of this those (of the Other Side) dominate only during the night, assuredly this is why Esau rules only in exile, which is night. Hence, he wrestled and struggled with Jacob during the night. But when morning came, the strength of the angel failed, and he did not prevail. Then Jacob got stronger, as the dominion of Jacob is during the day.",
                "Therefore, it is written, \"The burden of Dumah. One calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?\" (Isaiah 21:11), for the dominion of Esau, who is called 'Se'ir', is during the night. Therefore the angel weakened when morning came, and then \"he said, Let me go, for the day breaks.\"",
                "\"And he said, I will not let you go, unless you bless me\" (Beresheet 32:27). \"Unless you bless me,\" but it should have been \"unless you will bless me\" (future tense). Why, therefore, is it written literally, \"unless you have blessed me\"&gt; (He told him) if you will acknowledge the blessings my father gave to me and not denounce me for them. It is also written, \"And he said, Your name shall be called no more 'Jacob', but Yisrael\" (Beresheet 32:29). Why did he call him Yisrael? He told him, we are compelled to serve you, for through your exceeding might, you have been crowned above, in the highest grade. Therefore your name shall surely be Yisrael.",
                "\"For you have striven with Elohim.\" What is the meaning of the phrase \"with Elohim?\" Could it be that he referred to himself? \"Have striven\" to be joined and united \"with Elohim,\" as the union of the sun and moon. Hence it is not written \"against Elohim,\" but rather \"with Elohim,\" in a union.",
                "Another explanation of \"And he said\" has the same meaning as \"and He said, If you will diligently hearken to the voice of Hashem your Elohim\" (Shemot 15:26). Here too \"And he said\" (means) \"Your name shall be called no more 'Jacob', but Israel.\" Then was Jacob crowned by his grade, by which he will include all the Patriarchs. It is written, \"And he blessed him there\" (Beresheet 32:30). It means that he acknowledged all the blessings with which his father blessed him.",
                "Rabbi Shimon began the discourse with the verse, \"When a man's ways please Hashem, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him\" (Mishlei 16:7). Come and behold, Man has much to do if he wants to improve his behavior toward the Holy One, blessed be He, by keeping the precepts of the Torah. For we have learned that assuredly man has two angels, who are messengers that join him from above. One is on his right and the other on his left. They observe man in everything he does. They are called 'the Good Inclination' and 'the Evil Inclination'.",
                "When a man wishes to be purified and strives to observe the precepts of the Torah, the Good Inclination that joined him overpowers the Evil Inclination and makes peace with it. As a result, the Evil Inclination becomes a slave to the Good Inclination. When a man wishes to be defiled, the Evil Inclination is strengthened and overpowers the Good Inclination. This has already been explained. Assuredly, when man wishes to be purified, he has much to overcome. When the Good Inclination is strengthened, then \"He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.\" For the Evil Inclination is submissive to the Good Inclination. Of this Solomon said, \"Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and has a servant\" (Mishlei 12:9). The servant is the Evil Inclination. Then, when a man walks by the precepts of the Torah, \"he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him,\" including the Evil Inclination and its escorts.",
                "Come and behold, Because Jacob put his trust in the Holy One, blessed be He, and all that he did was for His sake, his enemies made peace with him, specifically Samael, who is the strength and might of Esau, made peace with Jacob. Because Samael made peace with Jacob and acknowledged all his blessings, Esau made peace with Jacob. Yet, as long as Jacob did not make peace with him, the minister in charge of Esau, then Esau did not make peace with him. This is because strength below always depends on strength above. As long as the strength of the ministers in charge over them is not weakened above, it is not possible to weaken the strength in this world.",
                "\"And Isaac trembled very much, and said, Who then (Heb. אֵיפֹה) is he\" (Beresheet 27:33). What is the meaning of \"Who then?\" It should have been \"Who is it?\" for 'eifoh' literally means where. He answers, \"Who then\" is correct because the Shechinah stood there when Isaac blessed Jacob! Thus he said \"Who then,\", where is he who stood here and approved the blessings, whom I blessed. Assuredly \"he shall be blessed,\" for the Holy One, blessed be He, approved these blessings.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said that for this trembling that Jacob brought upon Isaac his father, Jacob was punished by Joseph, and he trembled when they said to him \"This we have found\" (Beresheet 37:32). Isaac said \"Who then (Heb. אֵיפֹה).\" And by \"אֵיפֹה,\" Jacob was punished. And although the Holy One, blessed be He, approved all the blessings, nevertheless he was punished by \"eifoh\" as it is written, \"Where (אֵיפֹה) they feed their flock\" (Beresheet 37:6), where Joseph was lost to him, and he was thereby punished. \"...and Isaac trembled very much (lit. 'trembled very great trembling').\" What is the meaning of the word \"great\" as used in the scripture? It is written \"great\" here and elsewhere, as in \"and this great fire\" (Devarim 18:16). (Meaning) that Gehenom entered with him. What does \"very\" mean? It is written \"very\" here and elsewhere, as in \"and, behold, it was very good\" (Beresheet 1:31), referring to the Angel of Death. He then said \"Who then...\" (Beresheet 27:33), when he understood that the blessings belonged to Jacob and not Esau.",
                "\"And when Esau heard the words of his father...\" (Beresheet 27:34).",
                "Rabbi Chiya said, These tears brought so much evil (upon Israel), that Esau cried to be blessed before his father, whose words were very important to him. \"Is not he rightly named Jacob\" (Ibid. 36) means, So He named him, He who did so\". He uttered this as if spitting, to degrade (Hashem). It is not written, \"Is not he rightly named,\" but literally \"Did not He rightly named him.",
                "\"For he has supplanted these (Heb. zeh; lit. 'this') two times.\" Why Zeh to modify \"supplanted two times?\" It means two matters are contained in one. The word bechorati (my birthright) became at another time birchati (my blessing). In the same manner, the verse \"surely now we had returned this (Heb. zeh) second time\" (Beresheet 43:10), that two matters are in one: 1) we would have returned (Heb. shavnu) by now and not be put to shame (Heb. boshnu) by that man, and 2) we would have been back already. [The Hebrew letters of shavnu are the same as of boshnu].",
                "Similarly, Job said, \"and hold me for Your enemy\" (Iyov 13:24). Job turned into oyev (enemy). This was explained according to the verse, \"For He crushes me with a tempest\" (Iyov 9:17). He said before Him, Master of the universe, \"perhaps a tempest stormed at You\". Here also, \"he took away my birthright\" (Heb. bechorati), and the combination turned into \"my blessing (Heb. birchati), as in \"he has taken away my blessing.\"",
                "\"Behold, I have made him your lord...and what shall I do now for you, my son\" (Beresheet 27:37). This means that there is no one present who gives consent, \"What shall I do now for you, my son.\" He then blessed him in this world. He looked at his grade and said to him \"and by your sword shall you live,\" for it is fitting of you to shed blood and wage wars. Therefore he said, \"What shall I do now for you, my son\".",
                "Rabbi Elazar discussed the verse, \"what shall I do now for you.\" Why add \"my son?\" This is because he asked him \"what shall I do now for you?\" I have seen you in judgment, sword, and blood. And I have seen your brother walking the path of peace. He added \"my son,\" for surely I brought all this upon you, as you are my son. Therefore \"by your sword shall you live, and you shall serve your brother.\" This has not yet happened, for Esau is not yet a servant of Jacob. This is because Jacob has no need for him now. And he repeatedly called Esau \"my master,\" because Jacob looked far ahead and saved it to the end of days, as we said above.",
                "As Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Yosi were walking together, they noticed that Rabbi Yosi Saba was behind them. They sat down until he caught up to them. When he did, he said, 'now the path is readied before us,' and they went on. Rabbi Chiya quoted the verse, \"It is time to act for Hashem\" (Tehilim 119:126), while Rabbi Yosi began with the verse, \"She opened her mouth with wisdom; and on her tongue is a Torah of steadfast love\" (Prov. 31:6). \"She opened her mouth with wisdom\" alludes to the Congregation of Yisrael; \"and on her tongue is a Torah of steadfast love\" refers to Yisrael, who are the tongue of the Torah, which is on their lips day and night. \"She opened her mouth with wisdom.\" This is the letter Bet of Beresheet (Eng. 'In the beginning'). It is the secret of the Nukva, called 'house' (Heb. bayit). \"And on her tongue is a Torah of steadfast love (lit. 'Chesed')\" refers to Abraham, with which He created the world, and he speaks always. The letter Bet is closed on one side and open on the other. It is closed on one side, as it is written, \"and you shall see My back\" (Shemot 33:23). On the other side Bet is open, so that its face will shine upward. It is also open to receive from above, as a foyer to receive. For that reason, the letter Bet stands at the beginning of the Torah. Another explanation for the verse, \"She opened her mouth with wisdom,\" which assuredly opens with wisdom, as it is written, \"In the beginning Elohim created\" (Beresheet 1:1), in the Aramaic translation. Of the verse, \"And on her tongue is a Torah of steadfast love (lit. 'Chesed'),\" the Torah later reads, \"And Elohim said, Let there be light, and there was light\" (Ibid. 3).",
                "\"She opened her mouth with wisdom,\" is that it is the first Hei of the holy name Yud Hei Vav Hei, which is Binah, in which everything is contained. It is concealed and revealed, comprising both what is above and below.",
                "\"She opened her mouth with wisdom\"because it is concealed and utterly unrevealed, as it is written, \"Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the birds of the sky\" (Iyov 28:21). When (Binah) started to spread together with Chochmah that cleaved to it and was clothed in it, it issued a sound, which is \"a Torah of Chesed.\"",
                "\"She opened her mouth with wisdom\" is that the last Hei (and) refers to speech, which depends on wisdom. \"and on her tongue is a Torah of Chesed\" alludes to the voice, which controls and conducts speech, \"A Torah of Chesed love\" is Jacob, He is \"on her tongue,\" to guide the word and be united with it, for there is no speech without sound.",
                "Rabbi Chiya then quoted the verse, \"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and find knowledge in crafty schemes\" (Mishlei 8:12). \"I, wisdom\" refers to the Congregation of Yisrael; \"dwell with prudence\" is Jacob, who is prudent; \"find knowledge in crafty schemes\" alludes to Isaac, who used knowledge and stratagems to bless Esau. Wisdom was joined with Jacob, who dealt with prudence. Therefore Jacob (was to) \"find knowledge in crafty devices,\" by which he was blessed by his father, , and all the blessings rested upon him and prevailed upon him and his descendants forever.",
                "Some have prevailed in this world, and all will prevail at the advent of King Messiah, when Yisrael will be \"one nation in the land\" (Ezekiel 37:22), one nation before the Holy One, blessed be He. This is the meaning of the verse \"and I will make them one nation in the land,\" and they will reign above and below, as it is written, \"and, behold, one like a son of man came with the clouds of heaven\" (Daniel 7:13). This is King Messiah, as it is written, \"And in the days of these kings shall the Elohim of heaven set up a kingdom...\" (Daniel 2:44). Therefore, Jacob wanted his blessings to be postponed and did not take them at once.",
                "Rabbi Yosi then quoted the verse, \"But fear not, O My servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, Yisrael\" (Jer. 46:27). This verse has already been explained. Nevertheless, after Jacob had received his father's blessings, he searched himself and said, I want these very blessings to be postponed for the time, so they will last. He was frightened. A voice resounded, saying \"Fear not, O Jacob My servant, says Hashem, for I am with you\" (Ibid. 28), and I will never leave you, for, \"behold, I will save you from afar\" (Ibid. 27) at the time for which the blessings were reserved.",
                "The verse, \"and your seed from the land of their captivity,\" means that although Esau now took the blessings and (his children) will enslave your children, I will free them from his hands. Then, your children will enslave him. Then, \"Jacob shall return,\" - to these blessings. \"And Jacob will return\" assuredly \"and be quiet and at ease,\" as has been explained from the kingdoms of Babylon, Media, Greece, and Edom, which were enslaving Yisrael.\" And none shall make him afraid\" for ever and ever.",
                "As they continued walking, Rabbi Yosi said, Assuredly, whatever the Holy One, blessed be He, does in the world is in the secret of wisdom. It is intended to teach the greatest wisdom to mankind, so man will learn from those acts the secrets of wisdom. And everything is as it should be. His works are all the ways of Torah, since the ways of Torah are the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He. And even in the smallest thing, there are ways and paths and secrets of high wisdom.",
                "Come and behold, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai used to say that 300 legal decisions are derived from the verse, \"and his wife's name was Mehetabel, daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezehab\" (Beresheet 36:39). This he revealed only to Rabbi Eliezer, who was with him. That shows how many secrets of the Torah are in every deed in the Torah. In each word, there is wisdom and true doctrine. Therefore the words of the Torah are holy words, by which to conceive wondrous things, as it is written, \"Open you my eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of Your Torah\" (Tehilim 119:18).",
                "Come and behold, When the serpent deceived Adam and his wife, when he approached her and injected impurity into her, Adam succumbed to temptation. Then the world was defiled and the land became accursed because of him. He brought death to the world. And the world was punished because of him, until the Tree of Life came, atoned for Adam, and subjugated the serpent, so that his seed will never rule the seed of Jacob.",
                "For when Yisrael offered a goat, the serpent was subdued and became a slave as we learned. Therefore, Jacob served his father two goats (Heb. se'irim), one with which to subjugate Esau, who is hairy (Heb. sa'ir), and the other for the grade upon which Esau depended and to which he cleaved. (i.e., Samael).",
                "Therefore the world is accursed until a woman comes, who resembles Eve, and a man, who resembles Adam. They will deceive and beguile the serpent and the one ruling him, (meaning Samael). We have already learned this.",
                "He opened the discussion with the verse, \"and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents\" (Beresheet 25:27). The phrase \"a plain man\" means a whole man, according to the Aramaic translation, (for he was) \"dwelling in tents.\" He was plain because he dwelt in tents, he held fast the two sides, Abraham and Isaac. Because Jacob came to Esau from the side of Isaac. As we learned from the verse, \"With the merciful you will show yourself merciful...and with the perverse you will show yourself subtle\" (Tehilim 18:26-27). When he came to receive the blessings, he came with support of Abraham and Isaac from above, and so all was done wisely.",
                "Come and behold, When Jacob arose against Samael, the grade of Esau, Samael fought and wrestled with him, but Jacob overpowered him in several ways. He conquered the serpent with cunning and subtlety, but he was only overpowered by the goat (the two goats he served to his father Isaac). And though all is one, (meaning the serpent and Samael) nevertheless he also conquered and overpowered Samael in another battle. This is derived from the verse, \"and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he did not prevail against him\" (Beresheet 32:25-26).",
                "Come and behold, The merit of Jacob was such, that he (Samael) wanted to exterminate Jacob from the world. That night was the night when the moon was created (it was Wednesday evening). And Jacob stayed alone, and no one was with him, as we have learned that a man must not venture out alone at night. This is even more true on the night when the luminaries were created, for then the moon is defective, as it is written, \"Let there be lights (Heb. מְאֹרֹ''ת)\" (Beresheet 1:14), and the word מְאֹרֹ''ת is spelled without the letter Vav, which is a sign of a curse. Because Jacob remained alone that night (he was in great danger) because when the moon is defective, the evil serpent is strengthened and rules. Then Samael came and denounced Jacob and wanted him to perish from the world.",
                "But Jacob was strong on all sides, on the side of Isaac and the side of Abraham. (Samael) came to the right and saw Abraham, strong with the vigor of day, namely, the right side, which is Chesed. He came to the left, and saw Isaac, powerful with the strength of rigorous judgment. He came to the body and saw Jacob strong on these two sides. They surrounded him, one from here and one from there. Then \"when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh\" (Beresheet 32:26), a place outside the body, the one pillar of the body. Then \"and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was put out of joint, as he wrestled with him...\".",
                "Once day broke and night departed, Jacob was strengthened, and the power of Samael diminished. Then he said, \"Let me go\" (Ibid. 27), for it was his time to say the morning hymns and he had to leave. He confirmed his blessings and added a blessing of his own, as it is written, \"And he blessed him there\" (Ibid. 30).",
                "Come and behold how many were the blessings Jacob received. The one from his father he earned through cunning, and that gained him all these many blessings; the one of the Shechinah he received from the Holy One, blessed be He, when he returned from Laban, as it is written, \"And Elohim...blessed him\" (Beresheet 35:9). He was given one by the minister of Esau and one from his father when he went to Paddan-Aram, as it is written, \"And El Shadai bless you...\" (Beresheet 28:3).",
                "At the time when Jacob saw himself with all these blessings, he said, Which shall I use now? He decided to use the weakest blessing of all. And which is that? It is the last blessing from his father. And although this too is a powerful blessing, it is not as strong for having power over the world as the first ones.",
                "Jacob said, I will avail myself of this blessing and use it. The others I will reserve until the time when I and my children after me will need them. When (will this be)? At the time the nations gather to exterminate my children from the world, as it is written, \"All nations compassed me about, but in the name of Hashem I cut them off. They compassed me about; indeed, they compassed me...They compassed me about like bees...\" (Tehilim 118:10-12). There are three verses that correspond to the three blessings that he did not use. The one is the blessing from his father; the second is the blessing from the Holy One, blessed be He; and the third is the blessing he was given by the angel.",
                "Jacob said, At that time, I will need (all of the blessings to protect me) from the kings and all the nations in the world. I will reserve these blessings for that time. And now, for Esau, this blessing should suffice. This is like a king, who had several battalions of mighty warriors and several qualified ministers of war capable of engaging in warfare against mighty kings. In the meantime, when he learned about a great robber, he sent his gatekeepers. When (his servants) asked him, why did you choose to send the gatekeepers when you have such strong battalions available, the king replied, these will suffice to cope with this robber. I will reserve the battalions and ministers for war against the mighty kings, so they will be available when I need them.",
                "Jacob said the same, To cope with Esau, these blessings will suffice. But I shall reserve for that time when my children will need them to fight the kings and rulers in the world, who will rise against them.",
                "When that time arrives, all the blessings will be aroused on all sides and the world will be properly established. From that day on, this kingdom shall rise, above all the other kingdoms, as was explained when discoursing on the verse, \"but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever\" (Daniel 2:44). This is the stone that was cut out of the mountain and not by man, as it is written, \"from thence from the shepherd, the Stone of Yisrael\" (Beresheet 49:24). What is this stone? It is the congregation of Yisrael, as written, \"and this stone, which I have set for a pillar...\" (Beresheet 28:22).",
                "Rabbi Chiya said from here, as it is written, \"A remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob\" (Isaiah 10:21). About these remaining blessings, it is also written, \"And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples\" (Michah 5:6), among all the nations, not Esau alone, as it is written, \"And the remnant...like dew from Hashem.\"",
                "Rabbi Yeisa quoted the verse, \"A son honors his father, and a servant his master\" (Malachi 1:6). \"A son\" refers to Esau, for in the whole world there was no man who respected his father as Esau did; the homage he paid him made him ruler of the world.",
                "\"...and a servant his master\" refers to Eliezer, the servant of Abraham. This has been explained. The man came to Charan with great wealth and camels loaded with many gifts to lavish, yet he did not say to Betu'el and Laban, that he is Abraham's friend, or any other man, who came at Abraham's request, but when he started his speech, it is written, \"And he said, I am Abraham's servant\" (Beresheet 24:34). Later, he repeated 'my master' (several times). Because he respected Abraham with honor and kindness, they were patient with him for some time.",
                "Such is Esau; By right of that honor that he showed to his father, the Holy One, blessed be He, was forbearing with him when he ruled this world. And these are the tears that Yisrael shed under his yoke, until Yisrael will return to the Holy One, blessed be He, with crying in tears and weeping, as it is written, \"They shall come with weeping...\" (Jer. 31:8) and then, \"And liberators shall ascend upon mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau; and the kingdom shall be Hashem's\" (Ovadyah 1:21).

Rabbi Chiya opened the discussion with the verse, \"The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to its place where it rises again\" (Kohelet 1:5). This verse has been explained. But the phrase, \"the sun also rises,\" refers to Jacob when he was in Beer-Sheva. The phrase, \"and the sun goes down,\" refers to Jacob when he went to Charan, as it is written, \"And tarried there all night, for the sun was set\" (Beresheet 28:11). The passage, \"and hastens to its place where it rises again,\" is similar to the verse, \"and lay down in that place to sleep\" (Ibid. 11).",

And the sun rises every day from the east side, and travels toward the south side. It then veers to the north side. And from the north it veers toward the west. Then the sun moves to the west, where it sets. The sun rises in the east, as it is written, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva,\". The sun goes west as it is written, \"And went toward Charan.\" This teaches us that the illumination alluded to in the text, \"And Jacob went out,\" is a complete illumination comprising the two Columns, Right and Left, which is the secret of Chochmah and Chassadim combined.",
                "Rabbi Shimon said that Jacob went out of the ambit of the Land of Yisrael, as it is written, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva,\" which is the Nukva in its entirety, called 'Beer-Sheva', and called the 'Land of Yisrael'. And he went to another domain, as it is written, \"And went toward Charan,\" (outside the) Land of Yisrael, (where the Other Side rules). Jacob came from the east, as it is written, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva.\" This means that during the Sabbatical year, Jacob took the shining light from the supernal depth (Binah) and traveled west. \"and went toward Charan,\" a place of Judgment and wrath (Heb. charon).",
                "According to Rabbi Yosi, this verse refers to the exile. For at first, the light descended from the supernal depth, and Jacob took it with him and went to (pour it) on Beer-Sheva. This is, \"the well that the princes dug out\" (Num. 21:18), here Jacob received his illumination, and perfected the well (Heb. beer) in all its wholeness. During the days of exile, he wanders from Beer-Sheva to Charan, as written, \"and went toward Charan that is, to fierce indignation (Heb. Charon). What is the fierce indignation of the Holy One, blessed be He? It is the evil grade, the land of the dominion of another.",
                "Rabbi Chiya said that when the sun, goes west the west represents the throne of the sun, the place upon which the sun dwells. This is the meaning of the verse, \"and hastens to its place where it rises again,\" for it goes to that place to shine upon it. It takes all the lights and gathers them to itself.",
                "So we have learned that the Holy One, blessed be He puts on Tefilin which means He takes all the supernal crowns. What are they? They are the secret of the supernal Abba and supernal Imma; they are the Mochin of Chochmah and Binah, the secret of the two passages, \"Kadesh (sanctify to me)\" (Devarim 11:13) and \"Vehayah Ki Yeviacha (and it shall be when Hashem shall bring you)\" (Shmot 13:11-16). Kadesh is the Mochin of the supernal Abba, which is Chochmah. Vehayah Ki Yeviacha is the Mochin of the Supernal Imma, Binah. They are the head Tefilin, the first three Sefirot of the Tefilin, the secret of Yud-Hei, called 'head'. Thus, we have learned that the High Priest takes the first (lit. 'in the head'). After he took Abba and Imma, he received from the right and left. So it is found that he took all the Mochin, the Chochmah, Binah, Chesed, and Gevurah, the secret of the four passages called the 'Tefilin of the Holy One, blessed be He.'",
                "Rabbi Elazar says, The \"splendor (Tiferet) of Yisrael,\" takes all. And when the Congregation of Yisrael is drawn upward, it too takes them all, the male world of the Holy One, blessed be He, and the female world of the Holy One, blessed be He. And just as all the lights are emitted from this world, the world absorbs them all. For the worlds are equal. Therefore, Beer-Sheva is a Jubilee, and Beer-Sheva is the Sabbatical year, which is the Nukva. This means that the lights of Binah and the Nukva are equal, and both are called 'Beer-Sheva'. Because this sun illuminates only from the Jubilee the scripture reads, \"And Jacob went out from Beer-Sheva,\" which is Binah, also called 'Beer-Sheva', \"and went toward Charan,\" the west, which is the Sabbatical year."

Rabbi Yehuda began the discussion with the verse, \"For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways\" (Tehilim 91:11). This verse has already been explained by the friends. When man is born, the Evil Inclination enters with him and constantly denounces him, as it is written, \"sin crouches at the door\" (Beresheet 4:7). What is meant by \"sin crouches\"? It refers to the Evil Inclination. \"at the door\" means at the opening of the womb at a person's birth.",
                "David also called the Evil Inclination by the name 'sin', as it is written, \"and my sin is ever before me\" (Tehilim 51:5). This is because it tempts man every day to sin before his Master. The Evil Inclination never leaves man, from the day of his birth. The Good Inclination comes to man only when he seeks purity.",
                "And when does man seek purity? On his thirteenth birthday, man joins with the Good Inclination on the right and the Evil Inclination on the left. They are literally two appointed angels found constantly with man.",
                "When man seeks to be purified, the Evil Inclination is humbled before him, and the right rules over the left. And both the Good Inclination and the Evil Inclination watch over man whichever way he travels. This is the essence of the verse, \"For He shall give His angels charge over you to keep you all your ways\" (Tehilim 91:11).",

As the Holy One, blessed be He, surrounded Jacob with legions of angels, because he came complete with the supernal tribes, who were in a state of perfection. As it is written, \"And Jacob continued on his way, and angels of Elohim met him\" (Beresheet 32:2). It has been explained that after being saved from Laban, and departing from him, the Shechinah joined Jacob, and legions of saintly angels surrounded him. At that point \"Jacob said when he saw them\" (Ibid. 3). From these angels, he sent a group to Esau. This is the meaning of the verse, \"And Jacob sent messengers (also: angels).\" Surely these were real angels.",

But in another place, it is written, \"For He shall give His angels charge over you,\" namely, many angels, whereas here only one is mentioned, as it is written, \"The angel of Hashem encamps.\" The verse, \"For He shall give His angels charge over you,\" refers to angels in general, but the verse, \"The angel of Hashem,\" refers to the Shechinah, as it is written, \"And the angel of Hashem appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush\" (Shemot 3:2). just as it refers to the Shechinah in the first verse, so The angel mentioned here also points to the Shechinah. And so, \"the angel of Hashem encamps round about those who fear Him,\" to encircle them in every direction so as to deliver them. And when the Shechinah resides inside man, all the holy hosts come there.",
                "Come and behold, When King David was saved from Achish, King of Gat, he said, \"The angel of Hashem encamps...\" For the Shechinah surrounded him and saved him from Achish, his people, and those who attacked him.

He asks, Why is it written \"Vayitholel\" rather than 'וַיִּשְׁתַּגֵּעַ', as it is written, \"you have brought this fellow to play the mad man (Heb. וַיִּשְׁתַּגֵּעַ) in my presence?\" (I Sam. 21:16).",

So the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Upon your life, you shall be in need of that yet. And when he came to the house of Achish and was attacked, it is written, \"He feigned himself mad in their hands,\" like those Holelim ('madmen') he first envied when he said, \"for I was envious of the madmen.\" Only then did the Shechinah come and protect him. She dwelt there, around David.",
                "You may ask, if the Shechinah resides only in Her own place, which is the Holy Land, why was the Shechinah upon him in Gat, which is outside the Holy Land? She certainly does not dwell outside the land of Yisrael for people to draw plenty from Her, but can dwell outside to rescue men. Thus, when Jacob arrived from the house of Laban, all the holy camps encircled him and did not leave him alone.",

Rabbi Yehuda replies, Because he led himself into danger by remaining alone at night and saw clearly the danger he was in, the angels deserted him, for they came to guard him only from unseen dangers. Then, before entering into danger, he stated, \"I am unworthy of the least of all the mercies and all the truth, which You have shown Your servant\" (Ibid. 11). With this, he referred to the holy camps of angels who usually encircled him, but had left him because he had led himself to a visible danger.",

At that time, it is written, \"Let there be lights (Heb. מְאֹרֹת)\" (Beresheet 1:14), written without the letter Vav, being Wednesday eve, which could not give light without Chassadim. For this reason, \"Jacob remained alone,\" as Jacob, representing the sun, denoting Zeir Anpin, remained alone without the Nukva, as the moon, the Nukva was concealed from the sun, namely zeir anpin, called 'Jacob'.

He looked at the body of Jacob and saw it was comprised of parts of both the right and left sides, being the perfection of the Central Column. Since the Other Side can have no hold on perfection, only on imperfection, he could not overcome him. Then, \"he touched the hollow of his thigh,\" the one pillar nearest to the body, but somewhat removed from it. Thus, it possesses an aspect of imperfection and the angel seized it, and \"the hollow of Jacob's thigh was put out of joint.\"",

Jacob said, I know that Esau reveres the father's honor and has never troubled him. As long as I know that my father is alive, so I do not fear Esau. So as long as my father is alive I wish to appease him. Thus, he immediately hastened, \"and Jacob sent messengers before him.\"",

Bread is the Shechinah in both verses. Faith is the Shechinah, so lacking bread means lacking faith.",
                "Another interpretation of, \"Better is one lightly esteemed\" is that it refers to Jacob, who humbled himself before Esau so that Esau should later become his servant. By controlling him, he fulfilled the meaning of the verse, \"Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you\" (Beresheet 27:29). It was not yet time for Jacob to rule over Esau. Jacob left this to happen at a later time, for he was lowly then. Later, however, the one who pranks himself will become his servant, and then he will \"lack bread.\" This refers to Esau, who will become Jacob's servant, who was given \"plenty of corn and wine\" (Ibid. 28).",
                "Come and behold, Jacob knew that he needed him now. Therefore, he appeared as if he was lightly esteemed. By doing so, he showed more wisdom and guile than he had ever shown against Esau. Had Esau been aware of this wisdom, he would have killed himself rather then coming to this. However, Jacob did all this with wisdom, and about him Hannah said, \"The adversaries of Hashem shall be broken in pieces and He shall give strength to his king\" (I Shmuel 2:10)."

At once Jacob introduced himself as Esau's servant, so that Esau would not take heed of the blessings that his father bestowed on him. Jacob put them aside for the end of days.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda asks, What did Jacob have in mind when he sent Esau a message reading, \"I have sojourned with Laban?\" Did this message accomplish anything regarding his mission to Esau? A rumor circulated that no one had ever escaped the clutches of Laban of Aram, as he was well versed in sorcery and wizardry. He was also the father of Beor, who in turn was the father of Bilaam. As it is written, \"Bilaam the son of Beor the sorcerer\" (Joshua 13:22). Yet although Laban was the greatest practitioner of sorcery and wizardry, he could not overcome Jacob, whom he attempted to annihilate in several ways, as it is written, \"An Aramian wanted to destroy my father\" (Devarim 26:5). And so he sent him the message, \"I have sojourned with Laban,\" to make him aware of his power.",

Regarding Bilaam, it is written, \"for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed\" (Num. 22:6). Because everyone feared Laban and his sorcery, the first words that Jacob sent Esau were, \"I have sojourned with Laban.\" In case Esau thought it was for a short period, perhaps a month or a year, Jacob advised, \"and stayed there until now\" twenty years did I stay with him.",

This shows us that Laban was as great as Bilaam. He asks, Why is it written, \"that you speak not,\" rather than 'that you harm not?' He answers, Laban did not chase Jacob with an army of men to wage war against him, for the power of Jacob and his sons is greater than that of Laban. But he chased him to kill him with his mouth and destroy everything, as it is written, \"An Aramian wanted to destroy my father.\" This is why it says, \"that you speak not,\" and not, 'that you harm not'. It is also written, \"It is in the power of my hand to do.\" How did he know he had the power? From that which \"Elohim of your father spoke to me last night\"",

Of Laban too, the scripture says, \"I have learnt by signs\" (Beresheet 30:27), which means that he consulted magic and sorcery to learn of Jacob's plans. When he wanted to destroy Jacob, he planned to do it by enchantment and sorcery, but the Holy One, blessed be He, did not permit him to do so. Rather, He said to him: \"that you speak not.\"",

Could it possibly be considered a credit to him to say, \"I have sojourned with Laban?\" Despite what Rabbi Yehuda said, that everything follows its own kind, Rabbi Yosi gave another explanation for the difficulty in that verse. It is written, \"I am Esau your firstborn\" (Beresheet 27:19). Here, we should ask, is it becoming to a righteous man such as Jacob to change his name to that of an impure one? The explanation is that under the \"I,\" there is a tonal pause. Below the \"I\" is written the (tone) Pashta, whereas below \"Esau, your firstborn,\" is found the (tone) Zakef Katon, whose tone separates the word \"I\" from \"Esau your firstborn.\" What he actually said was \"I am who I am, though Esau is your firstborn,\" as has already been explained.",

Hence, I say to you, \"to my master Esau; Your servant Jacob.\" He blessed me with \"plenty of corn and wine,\" yet I have no stock of these; \"I have oxen, and donkeys, flocks and menservants,\" as a shepherd in the field. He blessed me with \"the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth,\" yet instead I \"have sojourned with Laban,\" a sojourner without even a house, let alone \"the fatness of the earth.\" The last was not fulfilled in me, as I have no land. I have only sojourned with Laban. He said all this so that Esau would not be jealous of him, on account of the blessings he received, and bring accusations against him.",
                "Rabbi Abba said, It is written that Jacob was \"a plain man, dwelling in tents\" (Beresheet 25:27). He was called \"a plain man,\" because his abode was in two supernal temples, Binah and Malchut, the secret of the tent of Rachel and the tent of Leah. He reconciles both sides, which meant that he balanced and perfected the Right and Left Columns. Do not conclude from the verse, \"I have sojourned with Laban,\" that he was contaminated by the divination of Laban. But in light of Rabbi Yehuda's observation that one seeks out one's own kind, according to the question of Rabbi Yitzchak, the explanation for, \"I have sojourned with Laban,\" is that he was wholeheartedly thankful for the grace and truth shown him by the Holy One, blessed be He. For everybody knows that although no one can be saved from Laban's accusations, the Holy One, blessed be He, rescued me from his hands when Laban wanted to destroy me. This is what he meant by the verse, \"I have sojourned with Laban.\" Furthermore, he said all this so that Esau would not envy him his blessings, but rather think that they were not fulfilled in him. Thus, Esau would not harbor any hate for him as Rabbi Yosi explained. Of this, the scripture says, \"for the ways of Hashem are right\" (Hoshea 14:10), and, \"You shall be perfect with Hashem your Elohim\"(Devarim 18:13)."

You may wonder why Jacob was fearful, since camps of holy angels accompanied him. He was fearful because the righteous do not rely on their merit, but on their prayers and supplications before their Master.",
                "Come and behold, Rabbi Shimon said that the prayer of the congregation rises before the Holy One, blessed be He, and He is adorned by that prayer because it ascends in several ways, One asking for Chassadim, another for Gevurot, and the third for Mercy. It consists of several sides, the right side, the left, and the middle, as Chassadim are drawn from the right, Gevurot from the left, and Mercy from the middle. Because it comprises several aspects, it is woven into a wreath and put on the head of the righteous One, the Life of the Worlds that is, Yesod, which gives salvation to the Nukva and from Her, to the whole congregation. But a solitary prayer does not include all the sides; rather, it contains only one aspect. One can only ask for Chassadim, Gevurot, or Mercy. Therefore, the solitary prayer is not prepared and accepted as is that of the congregation; It is not included within all the three Columns as is the prayer of the congregation. Come and behold, Jacob included all three Columns, being the Chariot of the Central Column, which includes both. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, desired his prayer perfected by all three Columns. It is therefore written, \"Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, did all that to encourage Jacob to pray, for He craved his prayer.",

And because he arrived early to plead his case, when, his colleague, who is the Good Inclination, comes later, it is difficult for man to unite with it! And he cannot raise his head, as if he carried on his shoulders all the burdens of the world. All this is because the Evil One came first. Of this, Solomon said, \"The Poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard\" (Kohelet 9:16), because the other one arrived earlier.",

This is the way of a righteous man because a righteous man does not believe the subtle evil monger, who is the Evil Inclination, even if he hastens to plead his case before the arrival of his colleague, the Good Inclination.

Thus, the Holy One, blessed be He, takes the righteous from among them and elevates them from this world. Only then does He receive His due retribution from the others as the last part of the passage reads, \"The righteous is taken away from the evil to come\"; before evil comes to rule the world, the righteous are taken away.

Terror (Heb. מָגוֹר) from every side, because he was anxious and afraid all his days. Rabbi Elazar said, \"And Jacob dwelt\" in this place that was unified with darkness. \"The land in which his father sojourned\" means precisely. \"In the land of Canaan\" alludes to a place connected to its proper location, which means that the Nukva is called 'land.' When She is connected to the Left Column, who was the father of Jacob, She is called the 'Land of Canaan'. As it was said, a place attached to its proper location, which means that the land of Canaan is connected to the land of his father's sojourning, which is the Left Column. \"His father sojourned\" is Harsh Judgment.

Thus, the world acts according to Mercy, and endures due to it.",

And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Hashem came upon him\" (II Kings 3:15); for assuredly the Shechinah does not dwell in a place of sadness. From where do we derive this principle? We learn this from Jacob, from whom the Shechinah departed during the time he mourned Joseph. When joy came upon him with the good news about Joseph, immediately, \"the spirit of Jacob their father revived\" (Beresheet 45:27).

                "2.  Rabbi Yehuda said, Assuredly it is so, and He created Adam above all. This is the meaning of, \"I have made the earth, and created man upon it\" (Yeshayah 45:12). Surely (we do not need to be reminded) that He made the earth - so why is it written, \"I have made the earth?\" Because I \"created man upon it,\" who exists to complete its unification into one wholeness. ",
                "3. He opened the discussion with the verse, \"Thus says El, Hashem, He that created the heavens, and stretched them out; He that spread forth the earth, and that which comes out of it; He that gives breath (also: 'soul') to the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein\" (Yeshayah 42:5). This verse has already been explained. Nevertheless, \"Thus says El, Hashem, He that created the heavens,\" refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, high above - who \"created the heavens,\" . \"He that spread forth the earth, and that which comes out of it\" - namely, the Holy Land, the Bundle of Life, \"gives a soul to the people upon it,\" is the land, that confers souls. ",
                "4.  Rabbi Yitzchak said, It is all above. For from there, the soul of life comes out into the land. The land receives the soul and issues it to all, as the river that flows holds all the souls and issues them to everyone in the land. She receives and distributes them to all.",
                "5. Come and behold, when the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, he gathered his dust from the four directions of the world. He created him on the site of the Lower Temple and then drew upon him the soul of life from the Upper Temple .",
                "6. And the soul consists of three grades and therefore has three names, just like the Supernal Secret, Nefesh, Ruach, and Neshamah. The Nefesh, as has been explained, is the lowest of them all. The Ruach is its sustenance. It rules over the Nefesh, being of a higher grade to sustain it well in everything. The Neshamah is the supreme existence. It reigns over all, being a holy grade superior to all.",
                "7. The three grades, NEFESH, RUACH AND NESHAMAH, are included within men, who attain them by serving their Master. Thus first, man has a Nefesh, a holy vessel with which to be corrected. But when he is intent on purification through this grade, man is corrected and crowned with a Ruach, the holy grade that dwells on the Nefesh, with which the deserving man is adorned. ",
                "8. Once he is elevated by Nefesh and Ruach and attains correction through proper service to his Master, Neshamah, a supernal, holy grade that reigns over everything, dwells on him so that he may be adorned by the highest holy grade and be perfect in everything, on all sides, and thereby merit the World to Come. He is then beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written, \"That I may cause those who love Me to inherit substance\" (Mishlei 8:21). \"...Those who love Me\" refers to those in whom the holy Neshamah abides. ",
                "9. Rabbi Yehuda asks, If this is true, why is it written, \"all in whose nostrils was the breath (Lit. 'the Neshamah') of life...\" (Beresheet 7:22)? He replied, Surely THEY LOVED THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE. From all those in whom there was a holy Neshamah, none - such as Enoch or Jered, or the other righteous Ones - remained to protect the earth so it would not be destroyed in their merit. This is the meaning of, \"all in whose nostrils was the breath (lit. 'Neshamah') of life, of all that was on the dry land, died\" - they all had already died and departed from the world, and no one remained then to protect the world. ",
                "10. Come and behold, There are grades upon grades, Nefesh, Ruach, and Neshamah, grade above grade; first Nefesh, being the lowest grade, as we said, then Ruach, which dwells on Nefesh and is above it. Neshamah is the highest grade, as has already been explained. ",
                "11.Nefesh is David's Nefesh, which receives the Nefesh from the river that flows. Ruach stands over the Nefesh, which cannot exist without the Ruach, which dwells between fire and water. From here Nefesh is nourished. ",
                "12. Ruach depends for its existence on yet a higher grade called 'Neshamah,' which is the origin of both Ruach and Nefesh. The Ruach is nourished from them. When Ruach travels, Nefesh also travels, and all is one. They approach each other, Nefesh to Ruach and Ruach to Neshamah, and are all one. ",
                "13. Come and behold, \" ...Came near to him\" refers to the one world approaching the other world so that all becomes one. Because both Judah and Joseph were kings, they approached each other and joined together. "

                "Jacob arrived at the prophecy of \"and...lived\" only in Egypt. It was an excellent prophecy, the like of which was never prophesied before. None of the prophets was worthy of it except for him and Moses. It is written of Moses, \"For no man shall see Me, and live\" (Shemot 33:20). Of Jacob, it is written, \"And Jacob lived\", the prophecy which descends from the shining mirror.",
                "Jacob wanted to prophesy concerning the exiles of his children in the land of Canaan and in any land wherein they dwelt which came from the land of Egypt; to wit, all exiles are included within Egypt. His heart broke, as it is written, \"Now Jacob saw that there was corn (also: 'breaking') in Egypt\" (Beresheet 42:1).",
                "Hence, when it came to pass that \"Jacob lived in Egypt,\" he did not rejoice, because this land was the bond of the nations; the sapphires of the Throne of Glory. Nobody came to them, neither from the upper nor from the lower, save the living. This is the secret of: \"For no man shall see Me, and live.\"",
                "There are high mysteries in this verse, and we friends wonder about them, for it says that Jacob lived instead of Yisrael, to wit 'And Israel lived.' For the name Jacob indicates smallness, and the name Israel indicates Mochin of greatness, while \"and lived\" alludes to the Light of Chayah, which is the Mochin of greatness. It should have said, 'And Israel lived.' How do we know that Yisrael indicates Mochin of Greatness? From the verse, \"Yisrael is holy to Hashem\" (Jer. 2:3), (Holy is an allusion to greatness). It also says, \"Israel is My son, My firstborn\" (Shemot 4:22), firstborn being an allusion to greatness. Rabbi Elazar, the son of Rabbi Shimon, said, Yet scripture says, \"and he sold his birthright to Jacob\" (Beresheet 25:33), for with the birthright, which is greatness, the name Jacob is mentioned.",

It means that the strength of a person should be in the place which sustains and connects everything, and which is called \"ad,\" as is written, \"In the morning he shall devour the prey (Heb. עַד)\" (Beresheet 49:27). \"Ad\" is the place that unites this side and that side, for sustenance and connecting, a connection that will not be destroyed.",
                "And everything directs its desire towards \"Ad,\" as written, \"to (Heb. עַד ) the utmost bound (or desire) of the everlasting hills\" (Beresheet 49:26). Who are the everlasting hills? These are the two matriarchs, females, Jubilee and Sabbatical year. Binah is called Yovel (Eng. Jubilee) and Malchut Shmitah (Eng. Sabbatical year), and both are called \"everlasting hills (lit. 'hills of the world').\" 'World' as you say \"from everlasting to everlasting (lit. 'from the world to the world')\" (Tehilim 106:48), meaning Binah and Malchut, for both are called 'world'.",
                "And they desire Ad, it sustains all sides; Jubilee, desires Ad, to adorn it and to pour on it blessings, and to pour sweet springs onto it. This is the meaning of, \"Go forth, O daughters of Zion, and behold King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him\" (Shir Hashirim 3:11). King Solomon (Heb. Shlomo) is the secret of the King that the peace (Heb. shalom) is His, which is Zeir Anpin; his mother is the secret of Binah. Sabbatical year, desires Ad, to be blessed by it and to illuminate from it. The everlasting hills assuredly desire Ad, the one to pour on it its abundance and the other to receive.",
                "Therefore \"Trust in Hashem forever\" (Isaiah 26:4). For from there up, the place is covered and hidden, as none can conceive it. It is a place from which the worlds emerge and are formed. This is the meaning of, \"For Yah Hashem is an everlasting rock.\" This place is hidden and concealed. Therefore, \"Trust in Hashem forever (Heb. adei ad),\" that up to here, everyone is permitted to observe. From here and further no one is permitted to observe because it is concealed from everyone. And what is Yah, Yud Hei Vav Hei, whence all the worlds were formed, and no one is able to understand that place, in order to conceive anything.",
                "Rabbi Yehuda said, The scripture proves this. For is written, \"For ask now the days that are past...(Devarim 4:32). Up to here, one is permitted to observe, but from here and further, no one can comprehend it.",
                "Another explanation, \"Trust in Hashem forever\" - a person has to strengthen himself in the Holy One, blessed be He, throughout his life. No one can harm one who properly places his trust and strength in Him, since one who places his strength in the Holy Name endures forever.",
                "What is the reason? Since the world endures by His Holy Name. This is the meaning of, \"For Yah Hashem is an everlasting (lit. 'worlds') rock (Heb. tzur)\" (Isaiah 26:4), the former (Heb. צַיָּיר) of worlds. For by two letters were the worlds created, this world and the World to Come. This world was created with Judgment and is maintained on Judgment. This is the meaning of, \"In the beginning Elohim created\" (Beresheet 1:1). The reason is so that people would conduct themselves according to judgment (law) and would not digress from the path.",
                "Come and see, It is written, \"And Elohim spoke to Moses\" (Shemot 6:1). This alludes to the decree of Judgment that is looming over him. It is written before, \"And Moses returned to Hashem, and said, Adonai\" (Shemot 5:22) spelled Aleph Dalet Nun Yud. See the strength of Moses, as soon as he started prophesying, his spirit did not rest at this place. He said, \"Adonai, why have You dealt ill with this people? why is it that You have sent me? for since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name he has done evil to this people; neither have You delivered your people at all\" (Ibid. 22-23). Who talks like this? Only Moses who knew that a another, higher level was intended for him, because he was a Chariot to Zeir Anpin, which is the husband of Queen.",
                "Rabbi Yitzchak said, at first, the house, was given to him, he commanded it like a man would command his household, and spoke whatever he wished to without fear. Moses too spoke to his household without fear.",
                "Another explanation of, \"And Elohim spoke\": the decree of Judgment. \"And said to him, 'I am Hashem'\": This is a different grade, which is Mercy, and here everything is connected together, Judgment and Mercy. This is the meaning of, \"And said to him, 'I am Hashem'\". Rabbi Shimon said, If it were written, \"And Elohim spoke to Moses, 'I am Hashem,'\" I would say they are linked together. But it is not written so. Rather, it is first written, \"And Elohim spoke to Moses\" and then, \"And said to him, 'I am Hashem,'\" which means they are a grade after another grade instead of Judgment and Mercy linked together.",
                "And Rabbi Yosi said, Had not Moses been the master of the house, \"the man of Elohim\" (Tehilim 90:1), he would have been punished for saying this to Hashem. But since he was (master of the house), he was not punished. This is like a man who had a quarrel with his wife and spoke to her improper words. She started to complain, but as soon as she started speaking, the king, who was present, took over the matter, and she became silent and stopped speaking. The king said, Don't you know that I am the king, and that it is in my presence that you spoke these words? Similarly, so to speak, with Moses, \"And Moses returned to Hashem and said 'Adonai, why have You dealt ill?'\" Immediately \"Elohim spoke to Moses,\" because the king's daughter started to complain. Immediately, the King took up the complaint, \"And said to him 'I am Hashem.'\" Did you not know that I am King, and it is in My presence that you spoke these words?",
                "\"And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob by, the name of El Shadai.\" Why did He use a different name than the names before? This is like a king who had an unmarried daughter, and also a beloved friend. When the king wanted to speak with his beloved friend, he used to send his daughter to speak to him and thus the king spoke to him through his daughter. The time has come for his daughter to marry. On the day she married, the king said to her, precious queen, until now I spoke through you to whomever I wished to. From now on, I will tell your husband and he will speak with whomever it is necessary. After some time, the husband said harsh words to her in the king's presence. Before she started to talk, the king took the cause and said to him, am I not the king? Until this day no person spoke to me except through my daughter. And I gave you my daughter, and I spoke to you openly, a thing I have not done for any other person.",
                "Similarly, \"And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of El Shadai,\", when she was unmarried in My house. I was not spoken to face to face as I did with you, and you, at the beginning of your speech, said to My daughter in My presence such words. Therefore, \"And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of El Shadai, but by My name, Hashem, I was not known to them,\" to speak to them in the grade in which I spoke to you.",
                "Rabbi Yosi opened the discussion saying, \"A psalm of David. The earth is Hashem's and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell in it\" (Tehilim 24:1). The earth refers to the Holy land of Israel that is the first to be blessed by Him and watered by Him. Afterwards, the whole world is watered from it. \"The world, and they that dwell in it\" refers to the rest of the lands that drink from it. How do we know this? From the words, \"And He will judge the world in righteousness\" (Tehilim 9:9).",
                "\"For He has founded it upon seas\" (Tehilim 24:2). There are seven pillars on which the earth supports itself, and which are seven seas (the seven Sefirot). The Sea of Kineret (Galilee) rules over them. Rabbi Yehuda said, Do not say it rules over them, but the Sea of Kineret is filled from them, \"And established it on the rivers\"(Ibid.) Which rivers are being referred to? It is written, \"The floods have lifted up, Hashem, the floods (lit. 'rivers') have lifted up their voice\" (Tehilim 93:3), as written, \"And a river went out from Eden to water the garden\" (Beresheet 2:10). Therefore, \"He established it on the rivers.\"",
                "Come and see, this land, the land of Yisrael. Why does not Jacob, who is Israel, rule over it like Moses? For it is written, \"And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of El Shadai\" and no more.",
                "We have already established that Jacob took the terrestrial house, (i.e. in this world). Therefore, he lost the celestial house; but with the terrestrial house, he reestablished the celestial house, with twelve tribes, with seventy branches referring to its seventy names, which is the meaning of the seventy souls who came to Egypt. And we have already established that Moses took the celestial house and forsook the terrestrial house. Therefore, it is written of Jacob: \"By the name of El Shadai,\", by the name El Shadai did the Holy One, blessed be He, speak to him and no more. \"But by My name, Hashem, I was not known to them,\" to speak to them in this level, which is superior.",
                "\"And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\" Rabbi Chiya said, The glory of the patriarchs was Jacob, who was all-perfect. By all, it is written \"to Abraham, to Isaac,\" but by him a letter was added, as is written, \"and (= Vav) to Jacob.\" The letter Vav was added to him to show that he was more whole than them all. But notwithstanding, he did not merit uniting with it (Malchut) like Moses did, as earlier mentioned.",
                "\"And I have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan\" (Shemot 6:4). This is because they were circumcised. For all who are circumcised inherit the land. The Torah says, \"To give them the land of Canaan.\" For the land is inherited only by a righteous person and everyone who is circumcised is called righteous, as is written, \"Your people also shall be all righteous, they shall inherit the land forever\" (Isaiah 60:21). Everyone who is circumcised and observes the sign of the covenant is called righteous. Come and learn this from Joseph, who was not called righteous in his life until he observed that covenant, the sign of the holy covenant. Once he observed it, he was called righteous, namely, Joseph the righteous."

In this regard, it is written, “As the waters fail from the sea, and the river is drained dry” [Job 14:11].",

Prov. 10:25]. All things, all vessels, and all worlds does he uphold in Foundation.  In the last, in Sovereignty, he calls himself King, and his is “the greatness, and the strength, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in heaven and in the earth is Thine; Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and Thou art exalted as head above all” [1 Chron. 29:11].

                "Also, he made beings to serve these vessels: each a throne supported by four columns, with six steps to the throne; in all, ten. Altogether, the throne is like the cup of benediction about which ten statements are made [in the Talmud], harmonious with the Torah which was given in Ten Words [the Decalogue], and with the Ten Words by which the world was created."

And how were they distinguished? Through the mannah! As it says, (Shmot 16:4), \"that I may thus test them [to see whether they will follow My instructions or not\"]. All those found to be faithful, the Holy One of Blessing marks them, with the mark of the crown of Hesed, as it says (Tehillim 147:11), \"those who rely on ha-Shem's Hesed.\" It is because of this that \"I may test them.\" All those not found to be faithful, this supernal crown will be removed from them. For I proclaimed the mannah, saying (Mishlei 13:25), \"[The righteous man eats to his heart’s content,] but the belly of the wicked is empty.\" With all this, (Shmot 16:18) \"the one who had gathered much had no excess, and the one who had gathered little had no deficiency; [they had gathered as much as they needed to eat.]\"",
                "It was taught, at the time Yisrael was completed below, so it was above, as it has been established by what it written (Shmot 15:27), \"And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; [and they encamped there beside the water.]\" The holy tree was strengthened, with twelve boundaries, on the four sides of the world, and it was strengthened with seventy branches, all of them corresponding to what's above.",
                "At that time, the holy dew dripped down, from the ancient secret place, filling the top of the Ze'ir Anpin, the place that is called heaven. From that dew of the supernal holy light, the manna continued to descend below. When it descended, it spread out as frosted layers, and solidified below. This is what is written (Shmot 16:14), \"[When the fall of dew lifted, there, over the surface of the wilderness, lay a fine and flaky substance,] as fine as frost on the ground.\"",
                "All of these faithful ones went out and gathered [the manna] and made blessing upon the holy name. That manna brought out the scents of all the spices that are in Gan Eden, for through [the Garden] it had descended below. All possibilities before them, they could taste whatever they desired, for here it had that taste. And they blessed the supreme holy sovereign.",
                "Then it was blessed in their innards, and they looked knew what was above, knowing supernal wisdom. Hence they were called the knowing-generation. These were the faithful ones, and to them the Torah was given, that they would gaze into it and come to know its ways.",
                "And those that were not faithful ones, what is written of them (Bamidbar 11:8)? \"The people were scattered around, collecting [the manna].\" Why 'scattered'? Because they were scatter-brained in collecting for themselves, since they were not faithful ones. And what is written of them [in the rest of the verse]? \"They would ground [the manna] with millstones or pound it in a mortar, [boil it in a pot, and make it into cakes].

What brought this upon them? It was because they were not faithful ones.",

Who caused this? It was because they were not faithful ones.",

And there are those way, just as a breast can change in many ways, so too manna could change [its taste] in many ways. Rebbe Yehudah said, \"rich in oil\", suckling with oil.",

Yet it is written, \"the one who had gathered much had no excess, and the one who had gathered little had no deficiency.\" Rather, according to what they ate, they gathered. It says, \"their eating\", that which they would actually eat, which is why it doesn't say, \"their food\".",

They would appear before Moshe for judgement. He would say to them, how many people are in your household, and how many people in that household. They would say, this many and this many. At that time Moshe would say to them, gather [manna] tomorrow, and each of you will come before me. On the morrow, they would go out and gather, and come before Moshe, presenting their vessels of manna before him so it could be measured. If the servant belonged in that household, a measure of manna for them would be found in that household's vessel. For there was one measure for each soul in the household. Measure the other, and a deficiency would be found in the food for that servant, for there was one measure for each soul in the household. [Moshe] would say, the servant is in that [household], for that is what it says, \"they had gathered as much as they needed to eat\", and is written (Shmot 16:16), \"a measure to a person for as many of you as there are.\""

It is as you say (Isaiah 1:18), \"Though your sins be like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.\" And it is written (Leviticus 16:30), \"For on this day atonement shall be made for you to purify you.\"",

And because of that, [the sacrifices] diminish as they go. \"And blue-violet (<i>tekhelet</i>)\" - that is Pesach, [when] the secret of faith is in control. It is the secret of the color of blue-violet. And since it is blue-violet (which has a similar root to the word for ending or finishing off), it did not reign until it destroyed and killed all the Egyptian firstborn. It is as you say (Exodus 12:23), \"And He will pass through to smite Egypt.\" Because of this, all colors in a dream are good except for blue-violet. ",
                "\"And purple\" - that is Shavuot, the secret of purple. For the written Torah, which was given upon it, is composed of two sides, of the right (mercy) and of the left (judgement). It is as you say (Deuteronomy 33:2), \"from His right hand went a fiery law for them.\" And that is [the understanding of] purple. \"And worm scarlet\" - that is [the understanding of] the Fifteenth of Av, on which the daughters of Israel would go out in linen clothes. It is as you say (Lamentations 4:5), \"those who were reared in purple [garments].\"",
                "And from all of these do we take the tithe for the Lord at each time, in order to have have [the Divine Presence] dwell upon us. On Rosh Hashanah , we take the tithe for the Lord, and it is the secret of Rosh Hashanah, which comes from the side of the gold. And on Yom Kippur, we take it - that is Yom Kippur - since the daughter inherits the mother. On Sukkot, we take it; and it is the Sukkah that covers and protects us. And it is written (Numbers 29:35), \"On the eighth day you shall hold a convocation.\" And that is the tithe for the Lord.",
                "On Pesach also do we take it like this, and that is [the understanding of] Pesach; and behold we have established the secret of the color of the light of blue-violet. On Shavuot we take it, and it is the two breads. And it is written (Exodus 20:1), \"And the Lord said all of these things, saying.\" So we take the oral Torah from the written Torah. The fifteenth of Av - It stands in gladness about the daughters of Israel. All the other days, they are for its reparations. And it is about this that it is written, \"which you will take from them.\""

                "Rather, it can be likened to a King who had a single son who grew weak. One day he had a desire to eat. They said \"let the King's son eat this healing food, and as long as he eats it, let no other kinds of food and nourishment be found throughout the house.\" And thus they did. After [the son] ate this healing food, [the King] said, \"from this point and onward he can eat whatever he desires and it will not be able to harm him.\"",
                "So too, when Israel left Egypt they did not know the primary root and secret of faith. The Holy Blessed One said, \"let Israel taste this healing food, and as long as they eat this healing food they shall not see any other kinds of food.\" Once they ate the matzah, which provided them the healing to enter into and know the secret of faith, the Holy Blessed One said, \"from here and onward, they can see and eat chametz, for it can no longer harm them.\" And all the more so on the day of Shavuot, when the supernal bread is provided which offers healing from all;",
                "For this reason chametz is offered to burn on the altar."

In every place that a name is called twice there is a pause between them, such as \"Avraham, Avraham\" (Gen. 22:11); \"Yaakov, Yaakov\" (Gen. 46:2); \"Shmuel, Shmuel\" (I Samuel 3:10). All have a pause between them, with the exception of \"Moshe Moshe\", which has no pause between them. What is the reason? \"Avraham, Avraham\" - the last is complete, the first not. At first he was not complete since now he became complete through ten tests, and therefore there is a pause between them, since now he was not as he was at the beginning.",
                "Yaakov, Yaakov - the last is complete, the first is not complete, that now he had received the news about Yosef, and the Shechinah rested on him. Moreover, that now he was complete on the land, the sacred tree as corresponding to the upper [tree], in twelve dominions, in seventy branches, which was not the case at the beginning. And so at the end he was complete, at the beginning he wasn't complete, and there is a pause between the two. \"Shmuel, Shmuel\" - why is there a pause between the two? At the end he as complete, at the beginning he wasn't, since now he is a prophet and before this he wasn't. But \"Moshe Moshe\" - there is no pause between them since he was complete from the moment he was born, as it is written \" and she saw that he was good\" (Exodus 2:2).",
                "And even here \"Ad-nai, Ad-nai\" there is a pause between them, at the outset there was completion, at the end there was completion in everything. And Moshe, at the place of judgment said: descend to us from Atika Kadisha compassion to Ze'ir Anpin. Since this we teach: how many valleys Moshe has, that in every one of them he pulled down compassion. And so he revealed Atika in Ze'ir Anpin, all was seen in compassion. And the mark was transfixed and raised and smoke did not come out, as you say \"For My own glory I will be patient with you\" (Isaiah 48:9)."

THROUGH THE TAKING OF THE SHOE, HE PASSES ON THE LIVING FROM THIS WORLD TO THE OTHER WORLD OF THE DEAD. Now the living man takes this shoe OF CHALITZAH from the dead one. THEREFORE, the dead one walks among the living in that shoe.

In addition, the striking of the sandal from the hands of the wife to the ground comes to show that this dead one will be resurrected from the dust of another body in this world, MEANING HE WILL REINCARNATE. But he will first return to the dust whence he came. Then, that woman is permitted to produce other children, as has been explained.",

THAT IS, IN THE WORD Zot, WHICH IS MALCHUT, THE WORD Zeh IS INCLUDED, WHICH ALLUDES TO YESOD, AND THAT INDICATES THAT YESOD AND MALCHUT DO NOT SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER. From the female we enter into the male. Therefore, 'keep' and 'remember,' THE SECRET OF THE MALE AND FEMALE, are connected together.

Now she seems to be with a happy, delightful face. HOWEVER, she defrauds human beings SINCE, following this, she hits like a snake, destroys, kills, and says, \"I have done nothing wrong (Heb. aven, Aleph- Vav-Nun)\" (Mishlei 30:20). Therefore, she is spelled Nun-Vav-Nun, DERIVED FROM FRAUD, which is ascribed to her, THE Nun. The Tav is altogether composed of Dalet and Nun. Dalet and Nun are ALSO SIMILAR TO Nun and Resh, SINCE Resh and Dalet are the same thing; BOTH MEAN POVERTY. And with engraved letters, CHUKAT is composed of THE LETTERS Chet-Kof (lit. 'law') and Tav.

The bull that has gored thrice is harsh Judgment. Here too, temimah MEANS a lax sentence that is lower Gevurah, MEANING MALCHUT, since one that is as such is without defect.

The word \"ol\" is spelled WITHOUT A VAV, which is as it is written: \"and the man who was raised up on high (Heb. al, Ayin-Lamed)\" (II Shmuel 23:1). What is the reason? It is because she is \"the peaceable and faithful in Yisrael\" (II Shmuel 20:19), and he is not above her but rather with her. \"...And upon which never came a yoke...\" is as it is written: \"the virgin of Yisrael\" (Amos 5:2), and, \"a virgin, neither had any man known her\" (Beresheet 24:16).",

At that moment, all THE SENTENCES FROM THE ASPECT OF DEFILEMENT are stirred up to rise and dwell in the world.

Consequently, defilement and purification are the most important rules of the Torah, and the friends have already explained this.

She is without defect from the aspect of Chesed, which is a level of Abraham, of whom it says, \"walk before Me, and be perfect (Heb. tamim)\" (Beresheet 17:1). \"...In which there is no blemish...\" She is from the aspect of the Central Column, WHICH IS ZEIR ANPIN THAT UNITES HER LEFT AND RIGHT.

This is the meaning of, \"and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the girl, because he has brought out an evil name upon a virgin of Yisrael.\" Sages, this applies to after the wedding, since he says, \"I found not your daughter a virgin\" (Ibid. 17).

Yet the Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"I am Hashem, that is My name, and My glory will I not give to another, neither My praise to carved idols\" (Isaiah 42:8). The Holy Spirit is the Shechinah and is a name that was clothed with Esther.",

[<i> The Sages said that this tree was wheat</i>]",
                "It is not the custom of the King and the Matron to ride a donkey (Heb. chamor), [<i>Meaning, the literal understanding of the Torah is referred to as Chomer, which is similar to Chamor, and is comprised of wheat and the tree of knowledge of good and evil</i>]. Instead they ride on horses. [<i>'Horses' here corresponds to the secrets and mysteries of the Torah</i>]. This is the meaning of, \"you ride upon your horses, your chariots of salvation\" (Habakuk 3:8). For Malchut is not treated lightly so as to have the Matron ride on a donkey, and even more so the King, for it is no place for commoners and servants, [<i>The angel Metatron is called a commoner and servant</i>] whose way is to ride a donkey. This is why it says of Messiah, \"humble (Heb. ani), and riding upon an donkey\" (Zechariah 9:9). Ani stands for the Mishnah orders of Eruvin, Nidah and Yevamot, [<i>Ani also means \"poor\"</i>] and the rest of the Mishnah in total. [<i> As long as a person does not know the mysteries of the Torah, but only knows the revealed Torah, one is \"poor\" in knowledge and it is like he is \"riding on a donkey\", which is the aspect of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. However, Hashem</i>] is not considered a King until He rides on His horse, which is the Congregation of Yisrael [<i> This is Malchut/Kingship.

It is said of Israel as well that all Israel are princes [<i>Literally, 'the sons of kings'</i>]. Like the father, so are the sons. The children are not princes until they return to the land of Israel. You may say that he is a commoner, though he is a commoner in relation to his Master, do not treat lightly a blessing from a commoner, for this commoner is the servant Metatron. The first man, who did not keep the glory he was given [<i> because he ate from the Tree when he was not supposed to do so</i>], was brought down to eat together with his donkey, and he said {to Hashem} 'I and my donkey shall eat from the same trough'. Issachar merited this donkey by being called, \"Issachar is a strong donkey\" (Genesis 49:14).",
                "The sages who wrote the Mishnah {said that} it is said of the Matron, [<i>Matron corresponds to Malchut</i>], \"and His kingdom מַלְכוּתוֹ rules over all\" (Psalms 103:19), [<i> This is because she rules over the kelipot as well</i>]. After Esther put on {the royal apparel}, Esther ruled over Achashverosh and his people, and it is said of them, \"and slew of their foes\" (Esther 9:16). If you say that he {Achashverosh} mated with her, G-d forbid - though they were in the same house - {she did not mate with him}, but was like Joseph of whom it says, \"And she laid up his garment בִּגְדוֹ by her\" (Genesis 39:16). The word בִּגְדוֹ 'bigdo' is employed, which is derived from, \"traitors have dealt treacherously בָּגָדוּ\" (Isaiah 24:16). [<i> The 'beged' is the outer aspect, which the kelipot can attach themselves to</i>].",
                "There is a great mystery here, which is why 'Esther' is derived from mystery (Heb. seter), as written, \"You are my hiding place (Heb. seter)\" (Psalms 32:7), since the Shechinah hid her from Ahasuerus and gave him a female demon instead while she returned to Mordechai's arm(s). And Mordechai, who knew the explicit Name and the seventy tongues, did all this with wisdom. This is why the sages of the Mishnah stated that even regardless of this, a man must speak with his wife before he mates with her, because she might have been exchanged with a female demon.",
                "This is true for a woman who comes from the aspect of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, but if she is from the Shechinah she remains unchanged. This is the meaning of, \"For I am Hashem, I do not change\" (Malachi 3:6). \"I\" is the Shechinah, who has no fear from the other sides [<i> i.e. the kelipot</i>]. This is the meaning of, \"All nations before Him are as nothing\" (Isaiah 40:17).",
                "Wherever the Shechinah is, there are many special attributes {segulot}. Hence, since the Shechinah was clothed in her, Esther was worthy of having special things done to her like Sarah, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, kept, and since the Shechinah was with her He kept her from Pharaoh. The Holy One, blessed be He even made her clothes and jewels have special qualities due to the Shechinah that was with her. For that reason, when Pharaoh came {to touch} her sandal, {the angel} struck him with it, and the same happened with all her jewelry. Each jewel he would touch struck him until that defiled one left her and brought her back to her husband.",
                "If regarding her jewels this was so, it is much more so that whoever touched her body, even her finger, for the purpose of mating, then, \"and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death\" (Numbers 1:51), since the Holy One, blessed be He, did not give him permission to come near her. This is the meaning of, \"I am Hashem, that is My name, and My glory will I not give to another\" (Isaiah 42:8).",
                "For that reason not every {spreading of} an evil name is the same. The spies who defamed the land of Yisrael died. Those who speak ill of the Shechinah are most certainly struck in their souls, for those who spoke ill about the land were struck bodily and committed suicide. But whoever defames the Shechinah, his soul is stricken. This applies to whoever knows this secret and whose eyes are open. But a person whose eyes are shut is not punished as severely.",
                "As for what the sages of the Mishnah said to them that a raped wife is permitted to remain with her husband, permission and prohibition in the Mishnah speaks only of human matters and a woman who is from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. But the case of a woman who is from the Tree of Life is not as that of those {from the aforementioned tree}, since whoever is from the Tree of Life is a righteous person with whom things are well. Of him it is said, \"No evil shall happen to the just\" (Proverbs 12:21), nor to his righteous wife. We learned that from Sarah in the house of Pharaoh that he had no permission to come near her.",
                "Whoever is righteous but for whom things go badly, namely, he who is from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, since there is evil with him {at the moment}, \"For there is not a just man upon earth who...never sins\" (Ecclesiastes 7:20). As for an evil man for whom things go well, it is that the Evil Inclination overpowered his Good Inclination. Therefore they said that it is well with him, because the good is under the power {of the evil man}. And since the evil dominates the good, he is an evil man, since whoever is stronger receives the name. An evil man with whom things are evil is another El, who is Samael. It is evil with him, namely the poison of death, which is idol worshiping, {as it is said}, \"Evil shall slay the wicked\" (Psalms 34:22). For that reason a raped woman is considered so only if that soul has a mixture of good and evil.",
                "When the Torah was given, her tablets that were likened to virginity were broken. And the Holy One, blessed be He, again gave her to Israel to keep her. And the oral Torah is called Halachah given to Moses on Sinai. And the groom of the Torah broke her virginity [<i>just like the first tablets were broken</i>]. Whoever speaks ill of her and says that Torah is not {the same as the original}, since her tablets were broken, the Holy One, blessed be He, will speak to him, who is the girl's father, that daughter who is {hinted at} in the word בְּרֵאשִׁית (In the beginning). [<i> בְּרֵאשִׁית is spelled with the same letters as 'Bat Roshi', the daughter of my head. The Torah is therefore</i>]the King's daughter.

By her he observed the whole Torah even the Eruv Tavshilin (an action allowing one to cook on holiday for Shabbat). This is the meaning of, \"and kept My charge\" (Genesis 26:5). And he brought her up, as written, \"And he brought up Hadassa\" (Esther 2:7). And the Holy One, blessed be He, blessed him for her sake, as it is written, \"and Hashem had blessed Abraham in all things (בַּכֹּל)\" (Genesis 24:1). He brought her up with every good virtue and was charitable to her. He raised her to greatness, with the quality of kindness (Chesed) of Abraham. His house was, for her sake, wide open to do kindness to all the people of the world.",
                "And because he was kind to her, when Abraham's children were exiled because of their many iniquities in Egypt, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Faithful Shepherd, go and be kind to him who did kindness by you, since I gave him your bride, [<i>Malchut</i>], to raise with good qualities'. And he raised her {by the} thirteen attributes of mercy hinted at in the three words, Vav Hei Vav, Aleph Nun Yud, Vav Hei Vav, {וָה''וּ אֲנִ''י וָה''וּ} which are Vav, since the 72 names are comprehended in them the numerical value of Chesed/Kindness, with which Abraham overcame the 72 nations. Through your bride, he had a special segulah through the 72 names and he overcame every nation and tongue.",
                "For that reason {it is written}, \"That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses\" (Isaiah 63:12), [<i>This refers to Malchut</i>], and \"dividing the water\" (Ibid.) by tearing the water into twelve pieces, the numerical value of Vav Vav. And by merit of {the letter} Aleph [<i>the letter is found if you spell out the word Vav as Vav Aleph Vav</i>] You turned the sea into dry land. In it the Egyptians drowned, who did not believe in the Vav, [<i>This corresponds to Zeir Anpin</i>] which is {the value} one. In the future to come it will be fulfilled in Israel, the seed of Abraham, \"As in the days of your coming out of the land of Egypt I will show him marvelous things\" (Micah 7:15). In you it shall be fulfilled, \"That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, dividing the water\" of the Torah, to make yourself, \"an everlasting name\" (Isaiah 63:12). There you shall attain your bride.",

And you are Vav וָא''ו, [<i> Moshe corresponds to Zeir Anpin, which corresponds to Vav</i>] which is the full spelling of {Malchut} and her perfection. {She is called} \"a full cup\". For at first she was the throne of Yud Hei, כֵּ''ס יָ''הּ. At the end it is a cup (Heb. כּוֹס) full of the blessing of Yud Hei Vav Hei.",
                "And since {Malchut} was given through you to Israel, who are the Central Pillar, it behooves us to reveal why it was given them. For surely we learned why she was given to Abraham, [<i> He drew down the attribute of Chesed, which is synonymous with Abraham</i>], and you were kind (bestowing Chesed) to his children just as he was kind to you. And the Holy One, blessed be He, gave her to Isaac, to him and his descendants to keep her from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. And they made her some boundaries and cut for her some garments, golden garments with some laws. And they used to disagree and ask questions regarding these laws, to supply them with explanations, to decorate her with many decorations for Shabbat and holidays, to redeem her at the last redemption, as it says of her, \"That (Heb. מַ''ה) which has been (Heb. שֶּׁ''הָיָה), it is (Heb. ה''וּא)\" (Ecclesiastes 1:9) (making the initials of Moses).

That is because he and his descendants shall not be violated among the heathen nations because of the sin of Jeroboam who worshiped idols, for which he and his seed were to be violated among the idol worshiping nations. For Jeroboam the son of Nevat is a descendant of Joseph and it is because of him that it says of you, \"But he was wounded because of our transgressions and by his injury we are healed\" (Isaiah 53:5).",

                "\"If a man find a girl that is a virgin, who is not betrothed\" (Deuteronomy 22:28). This precept is to punish the seducer with fifty shekels of silver. This is the meaning of, \"If a man find a girl that is a virgin, who is not betrothed\": these are Yisrael, who, from the aspect of the Shechinah are called daughter. \"and lay hold of her, and lie with her, and they be found; then the man that lay with her shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not put her away all his days\" (Ibid. 28-29). The sages and all the members of the Yeshivah said, \"a man\" refers to Yisrael from the aspect of the Holy One, blessed be He, [<i>who at times is referred to allegorically as a \"man\". Note, this is strictly an anthropomorphism and not literal</i>]; \"and lay hold of her\" with the knot of Tefilin, \"and lay hold of her\" with the Tzitzit. \"who is not betrothed,\" namely an only daughter, who is the soul. \"and lie with her,\" namely with the prayer of lying down, that is, 'הַשְׁכִּיבֵנוּ (Eng. 'cause us to lie down')'. \"shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver,\" namely 25 {letters of the meditation of Shema} and 25 letters of the meditation {of Baruch Shem Kavod, etc.}",

Yet it has been explained that man should always study Torah even if not for its own sake, so that from studying not for its own sake it shall become for its own sake. And this Halachah is from the aspect of the good lad [<i>This refers to Metatron</i>] who separated from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which comprises the forbidden and the permissible, the unclean and the clean, the fit and the unfit. After, the lad is called a girl, נַעֲרָה, by whom it will be fulfilled, \"that the wicked might be shaken out of it, וְיִנָּעֲרוּ\" (Job 38:13). These are the forbidden, the unclean and unfit, Samael and his legions.",
                "According to another explanation, \"If a man find a girl that is a virgin\" refers to Yisrael, as written, \"When Yisrael was a child, then I loved him\" (Hosea 11:1), {they are called Na'ar} lad from the aspect of Metatron, [<i>Their sould are from the world of Beriyah, and Metatron is found there</i>]. The 'man' is none other than the Holy One, blessed be He, as written, \"Hashem is a man of war\" (Exodus 15:3). \"If a man find a girl that is a virgin,\" namely the virgin of Yisrael, of whom it says, \"The virgin of Yisrael is fallen; she shall no more rise\" (Amos 5:2). \"Behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness\" (Hosea 2:16). Then He opened for them fifty gates of freedom, which are the fifty gates of mercy of the side of their father Abraham, [<i>Abraham is commonly associated with Chesed/Lovingkindess in the literature</i>]. This is what is meant by, \"shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver,\" silver being of the level of Chesed, the levek of Abraham.",
                "For at the exodus from Egypt, the fifty gates of freedom were opened to them from the side of Judgment, which is left, which is Adonai, אֲדֹנָי, [<i>This corresponds to Malchut of the left side</i>] where, \"will I judge\" (Genesis 15:14), [אֲדֹנָי contains the letters of the word judgment, which is din in Hebrew], for first I judge and then they shall come out. But at the last redemption {it is written about it}, \"with great mercies {will I gather you}\" (Isaiah 54:7), which is the grade of Abraham. And Greatness, גְדוּלָּה, [<i>which is Chesed</i>], is the grade of Abraham, since Binah there is {referred to as} the 'great hand', and there are fifty shekels of silver there [<i>These are the '50 Gates of Binah'</i>]. Later, \"he may not put her away\" into exile, \"all his days\" because \"she shall be his wife.\" This is like the words, \"And I will betroth you to Me forever\" (Hosea 2:21), and another verse, \"For your Maker is your husband. Hashem Tzva'ot is His name\" (Isaiah 54:5). \"You shall no more be termed forsaken\" (Isaiah 62:4). For even though the Shechinah is in exile, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not move from her."

Of him it says, \"and she shall be his wife\" (Deuteronomy 22:19).",
                "In relation to mysteries of the Torah we have to employ an allegory. There is a soul that is the Matron, [<i>Drawn from Malchut of Atzilut</i>] and there is a soul that is a handmaid [<i>Drawn from the world of Beriyah</i>] such as in, \"And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant\" (Exodus 21:7). And there is a soul that is a common maid [<i>From the world of Asiyah</i>]. And so is man. There is a man who is a servant to the soul. Sometimes the soul goes by means of incarnation, [<i>Because of a sin in the previous incarnation</i>], \"the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot\" (Genesis 8:9), [<i>The soul is not at rest due to this previous sin</i>]. And the Evil Inclination chases it to enter that body, which is a maid to the Evil Inclination. It is a Jewish 'demon' and the soul is Yud {which is called} a Hebrew maidservant, in which this demon (Heb. שֵׁד) becomes Shadai, [<i>Shed plus the letter Yud</i>] because it kept the soul and repented through it, and with it blessed the Holy One, blessed be He, daily with 'Blessed (Heb. בָרוּך)', and with it sanctifies the Holy One, blessed be He, with 'Holy, holy, holy', and with it declares the unity of the Holy One, blessed be He, by Kriat Sh'ma.",
                "{Then} what used to be a demon, [<i>Which causes harm</i>] turns around to be its angel {the aspect of} Metatron and turned {to become} Shadai, because the numerical value of Metatron is that of Shadai. Immediately there is fulfilled in it {i.e. the soul} \"and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days\" (Deuteronomy 22:19). But if he does not repent, {the soul} is enslaved in him through the iniquities he committed and it shall be fulfilled in him, \"the wife and her children shall be her master's\" (Exodus 21:4), [<i>meaning the soul will leave the person so his root</i>] and it says of the demon which is its debtor, \"and he shall go out by himself\" (Ibid.), [<i>Without a remedy</i>]. That demon is like Moses' staff that turns from a staff into a snake and from a snake into a staff. So does this demon turn from a demon into an angel and from an angel into a demon, according to man's deeds.",
                "Of the demons that come from this, the sages of the Mishnah explained that some are like the ministering angels. They are the students of the Torah that know what was and what will be. They have their form on earth, being philosophers, astrologers of Yisrael, who know what was and what will be {through the} the signs on the sun and moon and their eclipses and each star and constellation; in this way they know what is seen in the world.",
                "Some of them {these 'demons'} ...are like beasts that increase and multiply like animals, and their form below is ignorant people, who, as the sages of the Mishnah explained, are vermin and whose daughters are abominable. Of their daughters it says, \"Cursed be he that lies with any manner of beast\" (Deuteronomy 27:21). They hate Torah students, sages of the Mishnah, who are in truth like the ministering angels. For that reason the sages of the Mishnah explained about man that if he is as \"a messenger of Hashem Tzva'ot\" (Malachi 2:7), one should seek Torah out of his mouth.
