What</b> <b>opacity</b> (<i>ovyut</i>) <b>is there in us that we must purify it through the Torah and commandments?</b>",
            "<b>I have addressed this topic in my books</b> <i><b>Panim Masbirot</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Talmud Eser HaSefirot</b></i><b>. I will review</b> the ideas <b>here in brief.</b>",
            "The Creator’s <b>initial intent for the Creation was to bestow benefit on the created beings commensurate with His generosity, may He be blessed and exalted. Therefore, souls were imprinted with the great will and desire to receive His</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> (divine bounty)<b>. The will to receive is the vessel that contains the measure of pleasure that is in the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i><b>, because the measure of greatness and strength of the will to receive the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>is commensurate with the measure of pleasure and delight in the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i><b>, no more, no less. They are bound together to such an extent that they cannot be distinguished from one another except in terms of that to which they relate: The pleasure is related to the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i><b>, while the great will to receive the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>is related to the created being who receives it. Both of these are necessarily drawn from the Creator, only they must be distinguished in the aforementioned manner: The</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>is drawn from His essence, that is, its existence emanates</b> from His essence <i><b>yesh miyesh</b></i><b>.</b> <b>The will to receive, which is incorporated there,</b> in the <i>shefa</i>, <b>is the root of all created beings, that is, it is the root of any new creation, which constitutes the emergence of existence</b> <b>ex nihilo</b> (<i>yesh me’ayin</i>), <b>since</b> the Creator’s <b>essence certainly does not contain any trace of the will to receive, God forbid.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Creator’s essence does not contain any aspect related to receiving, as He needs nothing from anyone, the will to receive could not emanate from His essence, as the <i>shefa</i> did, but rather had to be created as a totally new entity from nothingness.</i>",
            "<b>We can therefore discern that the aforementioned will to receive constitutes all creative material from beginning to end, to such an extent that the myriad species of creations, their innumerable incarnations, and their manners of behavior,</b> both <b>those that have manifest and those that will manifest in the future, constitute nothing more than quantities and differences in the measure of the will to receive.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All things in creation are formed of the will to receive, which can be viewed as the raw material that makes up the vast diversity of all created entities, both matter and living creatures. The differences between various created entities is rooted in the different measures of will to receive that each one contains.</i>  <b>Anything contained within</b> the vessel that constitutes <b>those creations, that is, anything received through their imprinted will to receive, emanates from</b> the Creator’s <b>essence</b> <i><b>yesh miyesh</b></i><b>. It is not in any way a new creation</b> that came into <b>existence</b> <b>ex nihilo</b> (<i>yesh me’ayin</i>) <b>, since it is not truly new at all but emanates from</b> the Creator’s <b>eternal essence</b> <i><b>yesh miyesh</b></i><b>.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>As stated, the will to receive was necessarily encompassed in</b> the Creator’s initial <b>intent for the Creation, in all its various forms, together with the great</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>with which He thought to benefit them and to grant to them. Know that this is the mystical meaning of light and vessel that we discern in the higher worlds, because of necessity they come bound as one, and they devolve together from one level to the next,</b> descending further and further from their divine source. <b>The measure by which the levels descend from the light of His countenance and become distant from Him is commensurate with the materialization of the will to receive that is subsumed in the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i><b>.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The system of Kabbala describes layers and levels of existence, in which the higher a created entity is, the closer to the source it is – that is, to the Creator – and the less material it is. In the process of Creation described here, the supernal light and the vessels descend through the layers, or spiritual worlds, to incrementally manifest as the reality we experience as this world.</i>",
            "<b>One can likewise say the reverse, that commensurate with the measure of the materialization of the will to receive in the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i><b>,</b> the combined will to receive and the <i>shefa</i> <b>increasingly descends from one level to the next, as will be explained below.</b> This continues <b>until</b> it reaches <b>the lowest place of them all, at which point the will to receive becomes materialized to its fullest</b> potential <b>measure. That place is termed the world of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> (Actualization), <b>and</b> there <b>the will to receive is manifest as a human body, while the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> the created entity <b>receives is the amount of vitality that is contained in that body. The same applies to the other creations in this world.</b>",
            "<b>Thus, the whole difference between the higher worlds and this world is that as long as the will to receive that is subsumed in His</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>has not materialized into its final form, it is still found in the spiritual worlds, which are loftier than this world, whereas once the will to receive has materialized into its final form, it is regarded as being found in this world.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>The aforementioned</b> <b>devolvement</b> <b>in which the will to receive is brought into its final form in this world follows the order of the four levels</b> that correspond to <b>the four letters of the four-letter name of God</b> (the Tetragrammaton). <b>For the four letters of the Tetragrammaton,</b> <i>yod-heh-vav-heh</i>, <b>encompass all of reality without excluding even the most minute particle.</b>",
            "<b>In general,</b> the letters <b>are expressed as the ten</b> divine attributes known as <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>,</b> the letters being synonymous with them: <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>, and their root,</b> <i>Keter</i>. <b>They are ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>because the</b> <i><b>sefira</b></i> <b>of</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i> <b>encompasses six</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>:</b> <i><b>Ḥesed</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Gevura</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Netzaḥ</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Hod</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Yesod</b></i><b>, and the root is called</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i> <b>.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Keter</i> is referred to as the root <i>sefira</i> in this context because <i>Keter</i> is like a bridge, so to speak, between the Creator and the creation. It is connected to the infinity of the Divine on one side and to the finite creation on the other. Thus it acts as a doorway, a link between His essence and the finite world. Without this doorway, there could be no process of creation at all. Note, however, that it cannot truly be thought of as a “bridge,” since His essence is infinite and can never be reached or grasped by anything within creation.</i> <b>However, they are mainly referenced as</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>. Keep this in mind.</b>",
            "Additionally, the four letters of the divine name correspond to <b>the four worlds, which are</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> (Emanation), <i><b>Beria</b></i> (Creation), <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> (Formation), and <i><b>Asiya</b></i> (Actualization).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>yod</i> of the name corresponds to the world of <i>Atzilut</i>, the first <i>heh</i> to the world of <i>Beria</i>&gt;&gt;, the <i>vav</i> to the world of <i>Yetzira</i>, and the second <i>heh</i> to the world of <i>Asiya</i>.</i>  <b>The world of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i> <b>includes this world within it. Thus there is no creature in this world that is not engendered from</b> <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i><b>, blessed be He, meaning</b> it is rooted <b>in the</b> initial <b>intent for the Creation, which is to give His creations pleasure, as stated above. This</b> initial <b>intent is necessarily comprised of light and vessel, that is, a certain measure of</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>together with the will to receive that</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i><b>. The measure of</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>emanates from His essence</b> <i><b>yesh miyesh</b></i> <b>, while the will to receive the</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i> <b>comes into existence anew</b> <b>ex nihilo</b> (<i>yesh me’ayin</i>), <b>as stated above.

At that point, the created being is complete,</b> composed <b>of</b> both <b>light and vessel, which is referred to as body and the light of vitality it contains.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>The reason that the will to receive</b> <b>devolves</b> <b>by means of the aforementioned four levels,</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> (Emanation), <i><b>Beria</b></i> (Creation), <i><b>Yetzira</b></i> (Formation), and <i><b>Asiya</b></i> (Actualization), <b>is due to an important principle that applies to the vessels: It is the expansion of the light and its subsequent removal that renders the vessel suitable for its function. This means that as long as the vessel has not been separated in any way from its light, it is encompassed in the light and subsumed within it like a candle in the presence of a torch. This subsummation occurs because the vessels and light are complete opposites from one extreme to the other. The light is</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i><i> <b></b></i><b>that emanates from His essence</b> <i><b>yesh miyesh</b></i><b>. From the perspective of the intent to create that stems from</b> <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i><b>, blessed be He, the light is intended purely to grant <i>shefa</i> and contains nothing of the will to receive. The vessel is the opposite, as it is composed of the ultimate desire to receive that</b> <i><b>shefa</b></i><b>,</b> a desire <b>that is the entire root of the created being, containing no ability to give whatsoever.</b>",
            "<b>Therefore, when they are bound together, the will to receive is negated by the light within, and</b> a created being <b>is unable to achieve a final form until the light has been removed from it</b> at least <b>once. For after the light is removed from it, the will to receive begins to yearn very much</b> for the light, <b>and this yearning determines and finalizes the appropriate form that the will to receive</b> will take. <b>Subsequently, when the light returns and is</b> <b>enclothed</b> in the form that the will to receive has taken, <b>from that point the</b> entity <b>is categorized as possessing two separate elements: vessel and light, or body and vitality. Consider this carefully, as it is the most profound of ideas.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Therefore, the four levels</b> that correspond <b>to the Tetragrammaton,</b> the four-letter name of God, <b>which are</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>,</b> and <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>, are necessary. The first level, called</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>, actually contains the entirety of the emanated being,</b> both <b>light and vessel. It incorporates the full will to receive together with the entirety of the light within it, which is called the “light of wisdom,”</b> also called <b>the “light of vitality,” as it comprises all the light of the life force that is in the emanated being</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in its vessel. Yet this first level is categorized as entirely light and its vessel is barely recognizable, since</b> the vessel <b>is mingled with the light and subsumed in it like a candle in the presence of a torch.</b>",
            "<b>Then follows the second level. At the end</b> of the first level, <b>the vessel of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>prevails by</b> <b>equating its form</b> <b>to</b> that of <b>the supernal light it contains. In other words, a will to give to the Emanator is awakened</b> within the vessel, <b>resembling the nature of the light it contains, which is entirely to give. Then, by means of this will</b> to give <b>that has been awakened in the vessel, a new light is drawn to it from the Emanator, which is called the “light of giving.” As a result, it is disassociated almost completely from the light of wisdom that the Emanator bestowed on it, since the light of wisdom can be received only in its own vessel, which is the ultimate will to receive in its fullest measure, as stated.</b>",
            "<b>Accordingly, the light and vessel in the second level are completely different from those of the first level, as the vessel</b> of the second level <b>has the will to give, while the light within it differentiates into the light of giving, a light that emanates from the power of the cleaving of the emanated being to the Emanator.</b> That is, <b>the will to give</b> that is awakened within the vessel <b>brings about the</b> <b>equating of its form</b> <b>with</b> that of <b>the Emanator, and the</b> <b>equating of form</b> <b>is</b> the way an entity <b>cleaves</b> to another <b>in the spiritual realm, as stated below.</b>",
            "<b>Next comes the third level, which</b> comes <b>after the light in the emanated being has been reduced to the light of giving and there is no</b> light of<i> <b></b></i><b>wisdom at all. Yet it is known that the light of wisdom is the essential life force of the emanated being. Therefore, at the end of the second level</b>, the emanated being <b>awakened and drew into it a measure of the light of wisdom to shine into the light of giving within it. This awakening thus draws once more a certain measure of the will to receive, which forms a new vessel referred to as the third level, or</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>. The light within it is called “the light of giving illuminated by</b> the light of <b>wisdom,” since the light is primarily comprised of the light of giving but a little of it is the light of wisdom.</b>",
            "<b>After that comes the fourth level. At the end of the third level, the vessel was also awakened to draw the full measure of the light of wisdom, as in the first level. This awakening constitutes a state of yearning that is similar to the will to receive that was present in the first level and in a way exceeds it, for at this point</b> the will to receive <b>has already been separated from that light because in this level the light of wisdom is no longer</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in</b> the vessel of the will to receive<b>, but rather</b> the vessel <b>yearns for it,</b> to receive the light of wisdom. <b>Thus, the form of the will to receive has been fully established, since the vessel is completed after the expansion of the light and its</b> subsequent <b>removal from</b> the vessel, <b>as stated above. When the</b> materialized vessel <b>subsequently returns to receive the light once again, the vessel will precede the light.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At this stage of the process, the vessel yearns to receive the light of wisdom. This yearning is what constitutes the completed vessel since the loss of the light of wisdom is what drives the vessel to yearn for it. The idea that the vessel now “precedes” the light refers to the fact that in this context the vessel is present yet, lacking light, yearns for it, so the vessel is said to be first in that it is present but the light is not. By contrast, in the first level the vessel and the light were both present, with the vessel subsumed within the light.</i> <b>Therefore, this fourth level constitutes the completion of the vessel, which is called</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>.</b>"

This partition prevents the supernal light from entering the final receiving vessel of <i>Malkhut</i>, leaving that level “devoid of any light.” This is meant to “save the created beings from the enormity of this distant separation” because by using the partition to refuse entry to the supernal light, the vessel of <i>Malkhut</i> creates a situation in which the ultimate receiving of the supernal light is actually an act of giving. As the author will go on to explain, this is like a person giving his friend the opportunity to do him a favor. Once the vessel of <i>Malkhut</i> achieves this, it is not as “enormously separated” from the Emanator, as it now also has the quality of giving, forming a connection to the Emanator through their shared trait of giving, a connection that the author of the <i>Sulam</i> refers to as an “equating of form.”</i> <b>For all the holy</b> <i><b>partzufim</b></i> <b>emerged with a</b> <b>partition</b> <b>placed upon their</b> respective <b>vessels of</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>so that they would not receive light in their fourth level.</b>",

The <i>Malkhut</i> has to be modified through the deployment of the partition, which represents <i>Malkhut</i> expressing its agency to choose not to receive the supernal light except on its own terms. This rejection transforms the act of receiving the light into a gift itself, as in the analogy of a person giving his friend the opportunity to do him a favor. The first part of that transformation is when the supernal light is rebuffed, or sent back, which allows that returning light to act as a partial receiver instead of the fourth level of <i>Malkhut</i>. The mechanism of this rebuffing of the light and the way it is used to enclothe the supernal light is explained further in the next sections.</i> <b>Subsequently the vessel of</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>expands commensurate with the amount of</b> <b>returning light</b> that was rebuffed by the partition, <b>which is the rebuffed light that ascended and</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>the supernal light from below to above, which then expanded from above to below.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">After the returning light bounces off the partition and is rebuffed backward, it serves as a vessel to enclothe the supernal light. This process is referred to as “enclothing from below to above,” since the returning light emerges from “below” at the level of the partition and travels upward. The enclothing of the supernal light is actualized when the Malkhut expands to form complete vessels, and this expansion takes place “above to below” because the supernal light travels downward, so to speak, to be enclothed in the fully formed vessels.</i> <b>In this manner, the lights are</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in the vessels, meaning in that</b> <b>returning light</b><b>.</b>",

Those roots are referred to as the “head” of that structure of sefirot. Once the Malkhut expands, and the returning light now serves as vessels, the supernal light is enclothed in this complete structure, which is referred to as the “body”; now the vessels are no longer roots but are fully formed. When this happens, and the structure of sefirot are fully constructed, the returning light is said to cease, since it is now acting as vessels for the supernal light.

            "<b>Now we will clarify five levels that are in the</b> <b>partition</b><b>, on the basis of which the</b> <i><b>shiurei koma</b></i> (literally, “dimensions of height”) <b>change during the</b> <b>fusion through collision</b> <b>between the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>and the supernal light.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the author of the <i>Sulam</i> will go on to describe, there are actually multiple rejections of the supernal light as it impacts, or beats, against the partition, which results in multiple fusions through collision. The partition changes after each fusion, so the measure of returning light that is refracted from it as a result is also different each time. Each measure of returning light is able to enclothe up to a certain “height” or level of light (defined by the author in previous sections), resulting in structures made up of vessels and lights of different “heights.” These are referred to as <i>shiurei koma</i>, or “dimensions of height,” referring to the “height” of the structure of receiving vessels that are formed as a result of the rebuffing of the returning light off the partition.</i>  <b>One must first thoroughly understand that although after the</b> <b>constriction</b> (<i>tzimtzum</i>) <b>the fourth level was disqualified from serving as a receiving vessel for the ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> of the supernal light, <b>and the</b> <b>returning light</b> <b>that rises from the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>by means of the</b> <b>fusion through collision</b> <b>became a receiving vessel</b> in order to receive the supernal light <b>in its stead,</b> the fourth level <b>must nevertheless, with its power of receiving, accompany the</b> <b>returning light</b><b>. Otherwise, the returning light would not be fit to serve as a receiving vessel.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The returning light changes the form of the receiving vessel by adding an element of giving, so that the receiving vessel resembles the supernal light, which is wholly giving. This allows the returning light to serve as a receiving vessel for the supernal light. Despite this added element, the original receiving capacity of the unconstructed vessel of the fourth level remains and is combined with the giving capacity of the returning light. Recall the analogy of the guest who accepts a meal at his friend’s house captures this. Though he accepts the meal only after he understands that by accepting the meal, he is doing his friend a favor, adding an element of giving to the receiving, he still eats with the same original receiving vessel, which is his hunger.</i>",
            "<b>You can understand this, too, through the aforementioned parable in section #15#. We proved there that the force of</b> the guest’s <b>rejection and refusal to accept a meal became a receiving vessel instead of the hunger and appetite. The hunger and appetite, which are the usual receiving vessel</b> for eating, <b>were disqualified here from being a receiving vessel on account of the shame and degradation</b> the person felt <b>at receiving a gift from his friend, and only the powers of rejection and refusal became receiving vessels in their place, because as a result of the rejection and refusal, the receiving was transformed into giving</b> once the guest realized that he would be doing the host a favor by accepting the meal, <b>and through them</b> the person <b>attained appropriate receiving vessels for accepting his friend’s meal.</b>",
            "<b>However, it cannot be said that now he no longer needs the usual receiving vessels, which are hunger and appetite, as it is clear that without an appetite for eating, he will be unable to fulfill his friend’s wishes and give him the satisfaction of eating with him. Rather, what happens is that the hunger and appetite, which were disqualified in their normative form, have now been altered, due to the force of the rejection and refusal, and have received a new form: receiving in order to give. Through this, the degradation is transformed into honor. Thus, the usual receiving vessels still function now as they always did, only they have received a new form.</b>",
            "<b>You can apply the same idea to the matter at hand. It is true that the fourth level was disqualified from serving as a receiving vessel for the ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> of the supernal light <b>due to the</b> <b>opacity</b> (<i>ovyut</i>)  <b>within it, meaning the contrast in form</b> as a receiver <b>in comparison to the Giver, which separates it from the Giver, as stated above. However, through the establishment of the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>in the fourth level, which collides with the supernal light and rebuffs it,</b> the fourth level’s <b>previous, disqualified form was altered, and it received a new form, which is called “</b><b>returning light</b><b>,” similar to the alteration of the receiving form into the giving form in the aforementioned parable. The contents of the first form did not change there; also now</b> the person <b>will not eat without an appetite. Here too all the</b> <b>opacity</b><b>, which is the power to receive, that was in the fourth level was altered and entered the</b> <b>returning light</b><b>, and thus the</b> <b>returning light</b> <b>was made fit to be a receiving vessel. Understand this well.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thus the fourth level called <i>Malkhut</i>, which solely comprises the will to receive, is replaced with the returning light, which contains the element of giving, but the fourth level – the original receiving vessel – is still required in order for the supernal light to be received. When the opacity, or the will to receive, of the fourth level enters the returning light, the new receiving vessel is formed, which is receiving in order to give.</i>",
            "<b>Accordingly, one must always distinguish between two forces in the</b> <b>partition</b><b>:</b>",
            "<b>The first is</b> <b>hardness</b> (<i>kashyut</i>), <b>which constitutes the force of rejection</b> inherent to it <b>to</b> be able to rebuff <b>the supernal light.</b>",

This is called a “purification” of the initial separation, or opacity.</i> <b>That is,</b> there is <b>the transformation of receiving into giving.</b>",

Therefore, the partition, positioned upon <i>Malkhut</i>, the ultimate form of the will to receive, can transmit one of the five qualitatively different types of opacity, one for each of the five levels mentioned here, and the returning light will be qualitatively different depending on the measure of opacity that rebuffs it.</i> <b>starting from the first level, which contains the most dilute measure of the attribute of receiving, followed by the second level, which is somewhat more opaque than the first level in terms of its attribute of receiving, and then the third level, which is more opaque than the second level with respect to its attribute of receiving, and finally the fourth level, whose own attribute is the most opaque of them all, as its attribute of receiving is complete in all regards.

As the author of the <i>Sulam</i> goes on to explain, each of the vessels contains a particular capacity for receiving the supernal light. For example, the light that fills <i>Keter</i> is a different level from that which fills <i>Bina</i>. <i>Malkhut</i> contains elements of receiving for each of these levels, allowing it to receive all the different levels of light that the previous vessels contain.</i>",

When there is a reduction in opacity, there is less conversion of pure will to receive into will to receive in order to give. As a result, the returning light rebuffed by the opacity in the partition is reduced, which reduces the levels of the supernal light that are able to be enclothed by that returning light.

            "<b>The answer is that there is a consistent inverse relationship between the lights and the vessels.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Within the system of Kabbala, the levels or layers of worlds descend from the more intangible, spiritual worlds to this tangible, physical world. This means that each vessel is initially very small because it is most spiritual at that stage. The vessel grows and develops the lower it descends, until it reaches the level of <i>Malkhut</i>, where the vessel has achieved its final form. The opposite is true with regard to light. Since the levels devolve from the most spiritual to the physical, the “lowest” level of light (it’s “lower edge,” or <i>nefesh</i>) is revealed in the constructed world first, entering through the highest vessel, <i>Keter</i>. When the light progresses to greater revelation, triggered by the presence of vessels with greater opacity, which draw the light to them, the light of <i>nefesh</i>, the lowest level of light, descends to the next, lower vessel. In this manner, the supernal light is increasingly revealed, while the preceding, higher level receives the next higher level of the light. This dynamic expresses a fundamental principle: The more the supernal light descends into the lower world and is revealed within it, the greater the drawing of divine light into the vessels of the higher worlds. </i> <b>It is the nature of the vessels that the higher vessels develop first in the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i><b>.</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i> <b>develops first, followed by the vessel of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>and so on, until the vessel of</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>, which develops last.

The lights are the reverse. In the case of the lights, the lower lights enter the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i> <b>first, because initially the</b> <i><b>nefesh</b></i> <b>enters, which is the light of</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>, and then the</b> <i><b>ruaḥ</b></i><b>, which is the light of</b> <i><b>Ze’er Anpin</b></i><b>,</b> or <i>Tiferet</i>, <b>and so on until the light of</b> <i><b>yeḥida</b></i> <b>enters last.

This new status is only theoretical because the giving has not yet transpired, and the receiver is only now prepared to receive the gift from this new position. When the friend ultimately receives the meal from his host in his new status as receiver in order to give, the vessels are then fully formed as <i>actual</i> receivers.

Instead, a beginning and an end can</b> now <b>be discerned</b> regarding the light, which contain two different aspects. The first aspect is the quality of <b>above and below,</b> in that <b>this light is arrested at the</b> entry <b>point of this world,</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this context, “below” refers to this world, where the light is not allowed entry. This stopping point reflects the “end” of the light, illustrating the idea that the supernal light now possesses an endpoint. The endpoint of the supernal light above our world at the point of the terminating <i>Malkhut</i>, the point where the light is arrested, represents the end of the process through which the supernal light of the Creator is hidden from the inhabitants of this world. This is in contrast to the supernal light prior to the first constriction, which had no beginning or end.</i> <b>which is the mystical concept</b> of <b>the</b> <b>terminating <i>Malkhut</i></b><b>, as</b> implied by <b>the mystical meaning of the verse “He will set His feet…on the Mount of Olives.”</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zechariah 14:4. The Mount of Olives symbolizes <i>Malkhut</i>, the fourth level. After the second constriction, the “feet” of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> are restricted from reaching this level and do not illuminate at this lower point. In the future, after the process of rectifications, the feet of <i>Adam Kadmon</i> will return to their original place of the fourth level, the “Mount of Olives.” The author of the <i>Sulam</i> quotes this verse here to illustrate that <i>Adam Kadmon</i> has a beginning and end – head and feet.</i>",
            "<b>Likewise,</b> the second aspect, similar to the qualities of above and below, is the quality of <b>from within to without. Just as there are ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>from above to below,</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>,</b> the six <i>sefirot</i> encompassed in <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>,</b> and<i></i> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>is the end of</b> the world of <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i> <b>from below, so too there are ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>,</b> and <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>from within to without.

The supernal light can be thought of as above us, and the <i>sefirot</i> are the vessels that act as a bridge from the supernal light above to the lower world below, translating and transmitting the supernal light into its lower forms (since all of existence is filled with the supernal light and animated by it, as stated in the first sections above). Alternatively, the supernal light can be thought of as being at the root of all of existence, or “within,” and the vessels of the <i>sefirot</i> serve to manifest the hidden supernal light into a revealed form in the world. From this perspective, the five parts of the body – brain, bones, sinews, flesh, and skin – named here correspond to the same five groupings of the <i>sefirot</i> used previously, namely, <i>Keter</i><i>,</i> <i>Hokhma</i>, <i>Bina</i>, <i>Tiferet</i>, and <i>Malkhut</i>.</i>",
            "<b>In this respect, the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i> <b>of</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i> <b>is like a mere thin line in relation to</b> <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i><b>, blessed be He, who fills all of reality. This is because the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i> formed <b>of skin encloses</b> the light <b>and limits it all the way around from without so that it cannot expand to fill all the space from which it was constricted, and only a thin line is left positioned in the middle of the space. The measure of light that was received in</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i><b>, which is the thin line, is called</b> <b>inner light</b><b>. The vast difference between the</b> amount of <b>inner light</b> contained <b>in</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i> <b>and</b> the amount of light that remains beyond <i>Adam Kadmon</i>, which is the remainder of <b>the total</b> amount of supernal <b>light of</b> <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i><b>, blessed be He, before the</b> <b>constriction</b><b>, is called</b> <b>surrounding light</b><b>.

It can absorb only the small amount that it is able to receive and subsequently transmit. This small amount that can be received in this way is referred to as the inner light. The remaining light that cannot be received by the vessels while they maintain the dynamic of receiving in order to give remains outside the vessels and is called surrounding light. Consider a pipe that is being fed water from a lake. For the purposes of this analogy, the walls of the pipe are the “outside” of the aspect of “within to without” and the length of the pipe is the aspect of “above to below.” The pipe can receive only the amount of water that it is capable of channeling to another destination that will receive the water. The remaining water must wait outside the pipe, surrounding it, as the pipe is incapable of taking it in while simultaneously channeling it and would simply be overwhelmed by the sheer quantity.</i>"

            "<b>We have thoroughly explained the mystical meaning of the</b> <b>surrounding light</b> <b>of</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i><b>, which is endless and unlimited in its enormity. This does not mean that</b> <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i><b>, blessed be He, who fills all of reality, is Himself the</b> <b>surrounding light</b> <b>of</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i><b>. Rather, the meaning is that when the</b> <b>fusion through collision</b> <b>occurred</b> with the partition that was placed <b>on the</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i><b>,</b> the supernal light of <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i> <b>struck the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>that was there.

            "<b>The reason</b> that the uncontained supernal light became surrounding light <b>is that there is no change or loss in the spiritual realm.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since nothing can be lost or destroyed in the spiritual realm, the supernal light cannot simply be stopped or extinguished from achieving its designated purpose of entering the fourth level. Therefore, it remains outside the fourth level as surrounding light, until the fourth level is finished being rectified to fully receive it. The process of rectification refers to the incremental way that the fourth level “evolves” to be able to ultimately receive the supernal light in its entirety. This process is discussed extensively in later sections below.</i> <b>Since the light of</b> <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i> <b>was drawn to</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i> <b>to be</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in the fourth level, it must achieve this, and therefore, although the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>has now prevented it</b> from entering the fourth level <b>and rebuffed it, nevertheless this does not nullify the</b> process of the <b>drawing forth of</b> the supernal light of <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i><b>, God forbid.

That is, it is achieved by the multiple fusions in the five worlds of</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>,</b> and <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>, until the rectification is completed so that the fourth level is rectified through all these fusions, in all its perfection,</b> able to receive the supernal light, <b>at which point</b> the supernal light of <i><b>Ein Sof</b></i> <b>will be enclothed in it as before.</b>",
            "<b>Thus, the impact of the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>on the supernal light does not lead to any change or loss.

The partition that is placed above the fourth level called <i>Malkhut</i> initially creates returning light that transforms the vessels from receiving vessels into vessels that can receive in order to give. In this way, they have the potential to be able to absorb the supernal light, which is entirely giving. At first, the vessels exist only in their initial “root,” or potential, form. This root form can be thought of as purely theoretical, like a blueprint for the fully formed vessel. This theoretical form is called the head” of the <i>partzuf</i>, because the head is associated with the theoretical world of thought. Subsequently, the vessel of <i>Malkhut</i> expands to fully form the lower part of the <i>partzuf</i>, the body, in which the <i>sefirot</i> vessels are now fully formed and no longer theoretical. During this phase, <i>Malkhut</i> can be thought of as a mouth because it lies at the bottom of the head. Additionally, in kabbalistic thought, a mouth represents the part of the body that translates one’s thoughts, which exist in the realm of the theoretical, into actualized, expressed words. The <i>Malkhut</i> of the head serves as the vehicle that allows the supernal light to be contained in the body of the <i>partzuf</i><i>,</i> the completed form of the vessels of the returning light. It serves to actualize the containment of the supernal light, bringing it from the theoretical stage of the head to the actualized form of the body. Thus, it is called the “mouth of the head.”</i>  <b>which caused the</b> <b>enclothing</b> <b>of the</b> <b>inner light</b> <b>within</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i> <b>by means of the</b> <b>returning light</b> <b>that</b> the partition <b>raised (as stated in section #14# above) – is also the cause of the emergence of the</b> <b>surrounding light</b> <b>of</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i><b>.

The vessel of <i>Malkhut</i> resists this pressure, represented by the partition. Since the surrounding light is inexorable, over time it erodes the partition, degrading it so that it loses its opacity. This removal of opacity, which the author of the <i>Sulam</i> refers to as “purification of the partition,” causes the body of the <i>partzuf</i> to revert to the more theoretical form of the head of the <i>partzuf</i>, causing the body to merge and unite with the structure of the head.</i>  <b>In other words,</b> the surrounding light <b>purifies</b> the partition of the <i>Malkhut</i> of the body <b>of all the</b> <b>opacity</b><b>, that is,</b> the opacity <b>of above to below, which is referred to as the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>and</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>of the</b> <b>body</b><b>.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “opacity of above to below” refers to the dynamic of the body of the <i>partzuf</i> receiving the supernal light, which flows from above.

In this state, the “separation” described here has not yet been achieved because the returning light only serves as theoretical vessels for the supernal light, the head that then expands to become the body.</i> <b>This</b> purification <b>leaves</b> the partition of the body <b>with only the root of the</b> <b>body</b><b>, which is the</b> same as the <b>partition</b> <b>of the</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <b>head</b><b>, called “</b><b>mouth</b> <b>.” That is,</b> the partition <b>is purified of all the</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>that is of above to below, which separates the</b> <b>inner light</b> <b>from the</b> <b>surrounding light</b><b>, and only the</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>from below to above remains, where this separation between the</b> <b>inner light</b> <b>and the</b> <b>surrounding light</b> <b>has not yet been achieved, as stated in the previous section.</b>",

The partition that was placed on the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head is used to create the returning light, which enclothes the vessels of the head and allows them to receive the supernal light. This <i>Malkhut</i> can therefore be viewed as facilitating the process of channeling and transmitting the supernal light. It is referred to as the fusing <i>Malkhut</i> because it is able to interact with the supernal light and fuse with it to some extent, generating the returning light through the collision. By contrast, once the <i>Malkhut</i> vessel has expanded downward, forming the body of the <i>partzuf</i>, the partition of the <i>Malkhut</i> of the body does not engage in any fusion with the supernal light. Instead, it serves as a barrier that blocks out the supernal light from fully entering the <i>Malkhut</i> of the body. It is this barrier against which the surrounding light beats. For this reason, the <i>Malkhut</i> of the body is referred to as the terminating <i>Malkhut</i>. This is the meaning of the “force of the partition”: the partition has the power to block the surrounding light from entering the <i>Malkhut</i> of the body.</i>",
            "<b>The difference between them is like the distance of an emanator from an emanated being. The</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <b>head</b> <b>that fuses, by means of a</b> <b>fusion through collision</b><b>, with the supernal light, is regarded as an emanator relative to the</b> <b>body</b> <b>because the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>placed on</b> the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head <b>did not repel the supernal light when</b> the light <b>impacted against</b> the partition. <b>On the contrary, by means of the</b> <b>returning light</b> <b>that rose</b> from the partition, the partition <b>enclothed</b> <b>and drew in the supernal light of the ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>of the</b> <b>head</b><b>.</b> The <i>Malkhut</i> <b>then expanded from above to below so that the ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>of the supernal light were</b> <b>enclothed</b> <b>in the vessel of the</b> <b>returning light</b><b>, which is called</b> <b>body</b><b>.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the ten <i>sefirot</i> of the lower half of the <i>partzuf</i> called the body.

            "<b>This</b> lack of dynamics of limitation in the partition of the head <b>is not the case with regard to the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>and</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>of the</b> <b>body</b><b>.

            "<b>However, together with this fusion, the remnants of the</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>of the</b> <b>body</b><b>, which were within</b> the partition of the body <b>at the outset, are manifest anew within the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>of the</b> <b>body</b><b>.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author of the <i>Sulam</i> is clarifying here that this partition is slightly different from the original partition of the <i>Malkhut</i> of the head because it contains a different measure of opacity than that of the original partition. Since the surrounding light degraded some of the original measure of opacity in the process that led the partition of the body to merge with the head, this partition lacks the opacity of the fourth level, but retains only that of the third level and above. As a result, this partition gives rise to a different structure of returning light, purified of the opacity of the lowest, or fourth, level. Accordingly, it cannot contain the highest light in its vessels, since it lacks the lowest vessel. The head of this new <i>partzuf</i>, then, is only as high as the bottom of the head of the previous <i>partzuf</i>, as the author will explain.</i> <b>The difference in form between the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>of the</b> <b>body</b> that was purified and then unified with the partition of the head <b>and the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>of the</b> <b>head</b> <b>is then discernible once again within</b> the partition of the body <b>to some extent.

This process of unification of the partition of the body of the upper <i>partzuf</i> with that of the head of the upper <i>partzuf</i> leads to a new fusion through collision, since the partition of the body is now a fusing <i>Malkhut</i> instead of an terminating <i>Malkhut</i><i>.</i> The surrounding light then beats against this partition and creates a fusion through that collision. This fusion leads to a new returning light arising as a result of that fusion that can serve as vessels for the surrounding light that was beating against the partition, creating a new head that will then expand into a complete body. However, this entire emergent structure of head and body rises only as high as the headof the previous <i>partzuf</i> since that is where the partition was operating. As a result, the head of the new <i>partzuf</i> is only as high as the bottom of the head of the previous <i>partzuf</i>.</i>  <b>Once the original source</b> of the partition of the body <b>is again discernible, from the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of the upper</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i> <b>and below,</b> the partition of the body <b>can no longer remain above the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of the upper</b> <i>partzuf</i>, unified with the partition of the head, <b>since the difference in form separates spiritual entities from one another.</b> Instead of remaining on the level of the head of the upper <i>partzuf</i>, <b>it must descend from there to the place that is from the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of the upper</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i> <b>and below.

This difference in the height of the structure, resulting from the returning light being unable to enclothe the same amount of vessels as it did in the first partzuf, means that the upper <i>partzuf</i> and this <i>partzuf</i> are different and therefore exist as spiritually different entities.</i> <b>as even the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of the new</b> emergent <b>structure is categorized relative to the upper</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i> <b>as merely its</b> <b>body</b><b>, since it is drawn from the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>body</b> of the upper <i>partzuf</i>. <b>Therefore, this difference in form divides them into two separate bodies.

            "<b>There is another element to the difference between the lower and upper</b> <i>partzufim</i>. <b>It is that each lower</b> <i>partzuf</i> <b>emerges from a different</b> <i><b>shiur koma</b></i><b>,</b> literally, “dimension of height,” <b>in the five levels of the</b> <b>partition</b><b>, as described in sections #22# and #24# above.

            "<b>For example, in the first</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i> <b>of</b> <i><b>Adam Kadmon</b></i><b>, whose</b> <b>partition</b> <b>has all five levels of its</b> <b>opacity</b><b>, that is, up to</b> and including <b>the fourth level, the beating of the</b> <b>surrounding light</b> <b>on the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>of the</b> <b>body</b> <b>purifies the</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>of the fourth level entirely without leaving even a trace of that</b> <b>opacity</b><b>.

            "<b>Therefore, the structure that emerges from this</b> <b>partition</b> <b>is at the</b> <i><b>shiur koma</b></i><b>,</b> at the structural height, <b>of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>alone, which is called “</b><i><b>Havaya</b></i><b> of <i>Ab</i> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i></b><b>,” or the “</b><i><b>partzuf</b></i> <b>of</b> <i><b>Ab</b></i><b> of <i>Adam Kadmon</i></b><b>.” As explained in section #22# above, the</b> structural <b>height of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>that emerges from the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>of the third level lacks the</b> vessel of <i><b>Malkhut</b></i> <b>among the vessels and the light of</b> <i><b>yeḥida</b></i> <b>from among the lights, which is the light of</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i><b>; see there.

In earlier sections, the author described the various <i>partzufim</i> through their differences of structure. For example, the <i>partzuf</i> of <i>gulgalta</i> has the full structural height of <i>Keter</i>, while the Ab <i>partzuf</i> only reaches the height of <i>Ḥokhma</i>. But how does the light transfer from one <i>partzuf</i> to another? In order for light to transfer between these <i>partzufim</i>, the head contains a quality called the trace of enclothing, which serves as a bridge layer between the higher <i>partzuf</i> and the one below it. The trace of enclothing is referred to as the male aspect of the head of the lower <i>partzuf</i> and is nearly at the height of the <i>partzuf</i> above it.

            "<b>This incorporation is called the incorporation of the female in the male, for the trace of</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>of the third level is called “female,” since it bears the</b> <b>opacity</b> that remains in that level after the purification of the fourth level, <b>while the trace of</b> <b>enclothing</b> <b>of the fourth level is called “male,” since it comes from a higher</b> structural <b>height and because it is more refined than the</b> <b>opacity</b><b>.</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In kabbalistic thought, the concept of male is associated with the greater refinement and prominence of the realm of ideas, while the concept of female represents the practical reality of the implementation of those ideas. Since implementation inherently draws from the ideas that precede it, or are “above” it, female as a concept is considered lower than the male. Accordingly, when the female is incorporated in the male, that is termed “higher fusion,” and when the male is incorporated in the female, that is termed “lower fusion.” Thus, the male is often described as the <i>mashpia</i>, meaning the one that directs or influences, and the female is described as the <i>mekabel</i>, the receiver that receives the instructions from “above” and actualizes them in implementation. It should be noted that these are abstract concepts that should not be confused with today’s modern usage of gender terminologies.</i>  <b>Consequently, although the trace of the male alone is insufficient for a</b> <b>fusion through collision</b><b>, even it becomes fit for</b> <b>fusion through collision</b> <b>by means of the incorporation of the female within it.</b>"

            "<b>Subsequently, there is also an incorporation of the male within the female; that is, the trace of</b> <b>enclothing</b> <b>is incorporated in the trace of</b> <b>opacity</b><b>. Then a fusion through collision takes place against</b> the partition of <b>the structure of the female alone, which is the structure of only the third level, and that is the</b> structural <b>height of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>called “</b><i><b>Havaya</b></i><b> of <i>Ab</i></b><b>,” as stated above.</b>",
            "<b>The higher fusion, where the female is incorporated in the male, is regarded as the structure of the male, which is nearly the</b> structural <b>height of</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i><b>. The lower fusion, in which the male is incorporated in the female, is regarded as the structure of the female, which is the</b> structural <b>height of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>alone.

This is because</b> <b>fusion through collision</b> <b>against the</b> <b>opacity</b> in the partition <b>that results</b> only <b>from the incorporation</b> of the female within the male <b>is insufficient for the expansion of the vessels</b> to form the body of a <i>partzuf</i> since the measure of opacity is insufficient. <b>Therefore, the structure of the male contains only a</b> <b>head</b> <b>without a</b> <b>body</b><b>, and the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of the</b> <i><b>partzuf</b></i> <b>is formed only from the structure of the female, which has its own</b> <b>opacity</b><b>.
