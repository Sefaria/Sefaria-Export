Likewise, the light in all the</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i> <b>is simple Divinity and unity, from the beginning of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>until the end of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>. The reason for the division into ten</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>:</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>, is due to the vessels that are called</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>. For each vessel is like a refined partition, through which the Divine light passes to the recipients, and therefore each vessel is considered as turning the light into a different color. Thus, the vessel of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i> <b>in the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>transports white (meaning colorless) light, since the vessel of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>is like the light itself, and the Divine light does not undergo any change on account</b> of <i>Atzilut</i> <b>when it passes through it. This is the mystical meaning of the statement in the <i>Zohar</i> (</b><i><b>Tikkunei Zohar</b></i><b>, Introduction 3b) concerning the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, that “He, His life-force, and His attributes are one” (as explained below).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the divine light descends to lower levels of existence, it remains intrinsically unchanged. However, the vessels that contain it at each level make it appear to change, relative to the created beings. The point here is that since <i>Atzilut</i> is a very lofty level, to us it is indistinguishable from the divine essence of the Creator. At this level, the concept of separation does not really exist in a meaningful way, so this level is viewed as \"one\" with the Creator.</i> Accordingly, the light of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i> <b>is considered white light. This is not the case for the vessels of the worlds of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>, where the light already receives on their account a certain change and dullness, when it passes through them to the recipients.

            "<b>In addition to the above, this metaphor of the four colors includes a particularly important allusion. For the supernal lights are called <i>sefer</i>,</b> book<b>, as it is written (<i>Sefer Yetzira</i>, Chapter 1, Mishna 1): “He created His world with three books: With a book, an author, and a story.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word for “book” is <i>sefer</i>. The literary structure of this line quoted from <i>Sefer Yetzira</i> is that God created His world with three elements (book, author, story) that are different permutations of the word <i>sefer</i> in Hebrew. In addition to <i>sefer</i> (book), an author is a <i>sofer</i>, and a story is a <i>sippur</i> (the letters “p” and “f” are different sounds of the same letter, “<i>peh</i>” in the Hebrew language, so <i>sippur</i> is also a permutation of the word <i>sefer</i>). Thus, using different vowelizations, the same root \"<i>sefer</i>\" refers to these three elements.</i> It is also written: “The heavens shall be rolled together as a book” (Isaiah 34:4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Rolled together as a book” here refers to the kinds of books used at the time of the prophecy, namely scrolls, which are rolled up.</i> Now, the manifestation of the wisdom in each book is not in the white</b> background of the pages <b>it contains, but only in the colors, i.e., the ink, from which the letters in the book, through the combinations</b> of letters according to the <b>wisdom, come to the reader. In general, there are three kinds of ink in a book: Red, green, and black.</b>",
            "<b>Similarly, the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, which is the mystical meaning of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>, which is entirely Divinity, is comparable to the white in a book.

For they are considered the ink in the book of the heavens, whose letters and combinations are manifested through the three aforementioned types of ink, and it is only through them that the Divine light is revealed to the recipients.</b>",
            "<b>At the same time, it must be noted that just as the white in a book is the primary medium</b><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intention here is that the white page is the majority of the physical content of the book, and as such it \"carries\" (<i>noseh</i> literally means to \"carry,\" which is the function of a given kind of medium) the other content upon it.</i> [<i>noseh</i>] <b>of the book, while the letters are all “borne”</b> [<i>nesu’ot</i>] <b>upon the white in the book – and were it not for the white, there would be no possible existence for the letters and all the manifestations of wisdom they contain – so too, the world of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>, which is the</b> <i><b>sefira</b></i> <b>of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>, is the primary bearer of the revelation of</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>, which is revealed through the worlds of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>.

As a result of this process, the vessels of different levels are able to descend to lower levels and then subsequently pull lower-level vessels back up to higher levels with them. This process allows for the lower worlds of <i>Beria</i>, <i>Yetzira</i> and <i>Asiya</i> to receive the illumination of <i>Atzilut</i> directly, as opposed to through the diaphragm.</i><i></i></b>"

            "<b>Four Modes of Perception, and the Two Modes Addressed by the <i>Zohar</i></b>",
            "<b>At this point</b> in the discussion<b>,</b> it is necessary <b>to understand the four modes of perceiving entities, which were mentioned earlier in connection to the first principle. They are: a) substance; b) form enclothed in substance; c) abstract form; d) and essence. I shall first explain them by means of tangible illustrations from this world. For example, when you say that someone is strong, truthful, or deceitful, and the like, you have the following aspects before you: a) His substance, i.e., his body; b) his form enclothed in substance, that is, whether he is strong, truthful, or deceitful; c) the abstract form; that is, one can remove the form of a strong, truthful, or deceitful person from the substance of the man, and perceive these three forms in and of themselves, unclothed in any substance or body, which means perceiving the attributes of strength, truthfulness and deceitfulness, and detecting merit or shortcomings in them when they are denuded of all substance;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the generalizing of an attribute in isolation from a particular person or example. A person can possess the \"form\" or attribute of honesty. One can also discuss the concept of honesty in isolation, in a general sense.</i> d) the essence of the person.</b>"
        ],
        [
            "<b>Understand that we have no grasp at all of the fourth mode, which is the essence of the person himself, without the substance. For the five senses, and our imaginations, will suggest to us only manifestations of the essence, but nothing of the essence itself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An example of the essence, the fourth mode, is the intangible, ineffable self that we each manifest through our bodies. In simple terms, this can be thought of as your soul, your self, the irreplaceable \"you\" that shines out and can be perceived by others through your actions and self-expression. This core essence of our being is beyond words and can never be grasped or directly contemplated. This core essence exists within all things and can be thought of as the divine life-force powering each creation. These essences cannot be perceived directly with our senses. Instead, we can only perceive their physical impact and manifestation within the measurable material world.</i> Thus, for example, the sense of sight merely presents us with traces of a visible essence which are visible because of the light. Similarly, the sense of hearing is merely the ability</b> to perceive sounds <b>from air</b> (sound) waves <b>striking an entity. The air that is pushed away by its force strikes our eardrums, and thus we hear that there is some entity in our vicinity. The sense of smell is only air</b> (odorant molecules) <b>that emerges from an entity, which strikes our olfactory receptors, and so we can smell. Likewise, taste is nothing more than the result of the contact of some entity with our taste buds. Consequently, all of these four senses present us only with manifestations of the activities that are caused by some entity, but nothing of the entity itself.</b>",
            "<b>Even the sense of touch, which is the most powerful of the senses – as it distinguishes hot from cold and the solid from the liquid – all these are merely manifestations of activities</b> taking place <b>within the essence</b> of the entity<b>. They are merely incidents of the essence</b> of the entity<b>. For the hot can be chilled, the cold can be heated, the solid can be transformed into liquid through chemical processes, and the liquid into air, i.e., mere vapor, at which point it entirely escapes any discernment with our five senses. And yet the essence still exists within it, since the air can</b> be <b>turned into liquid once again, and the liquid into solid. It should now be clear to your own eyes that the five senses cannot reveal to us any essence whatsoever, but only incidents and manifestations of activities</b> taking place <b>within the essence</b> of the entity<b>.</b>",

We do not miss it at all, just as we do not miss a sixth finger on our hands.

Only the first mode, substance, and the second mode, form enclothed in substance, have been granted to us with a clear and sufficient perception by Supreme Providence. Through them,</b> it <b>will also be possible to comprehend the existence of spiritual entities, which are in the upper worlds of</b> <i><b>Atzilut</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, and</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>, since there is not the smallest detail in them that cannot be divided into these four modes.</b>",
            "For example, <b>if you take a certain detail in the world of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>, there are vessels there, which</b> have <b>a red color, through which the light of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i> <b>passes to the inhabitants of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>, as stated above. The vessel in</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>, which has a red color, is considered a substance, or an entity, i.e., the first mode. Although it is merely a color, which is the notion of the incidence and manifestation of an activity in the entity, we have already said that we have no perception of the essence itself, but only the manifestation of an activity of the essence. We refer to that manifestation as an entity, or a substance, or body, or vessel, as stated above (section #13#). The Divine light, which is enclothed and passes through the red color, is the form enclothed in the entity, i.e., the second mode. This is why the light itself appears red, indicative of its enclothing and illumination via the entity, which is considered the body and the substance, as stated above, i.e., the color red.</b>",
            "<b>If you wish to dissociate the Divine light from the entity (the red color), and analyze it on its own, without the enclothing in the entity, this is already part of the third mode, i.e., form abstracted from substance, which is subject to errors, as stated</b> above<b>. For this reason, such an approach is strictly forbidden when studying the upper worlds, and no true Kabbalist would engage in it, and certainly not the authors of the<i> Zohar</i>. This is even more the case with regard to the “essence” of a detail in</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>, as we have no fundamental grasp even of the essences of corporeal entities,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, essences of corporeal entities of the levels, below <i>Beria</i>.</i> much less the spiritual ones.</b>",

This point is made repeatedly throughout this section . We, as the recipients, experience the diversity of being from our perspective, the “colors.” In contrast, from the perspective of the origin, “their place,” there is only the unity of the color white. See the previous sections, 27-29.</i> The <i>Zohar</i> <b>then states that He then made the form of the chariot of the “supernal man,” and descended and enclothed in the form of this man. In other words, the whole form of man in his 613 vessels are drawn from the vessels of the soul. For the soul has 613 vessels, which are called the 248 limbs and 365 spiritual sinews. These are divided into five parts, according to the four letters of <i>Havaya</i> and the upper point of the <i>yod</i>: Its</b> <b>head</b> <b>is considered</b> <i><b>Keter</b></i><b>;</b> the part <b>from the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to the chest is</b> <i><b>Ḥokhma</b></i><b>; from the chest to the navel is</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>; and from the navel to the end of the legs is the two</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>,</b> <i><b>Tiferet</b></i> <b>and</b> <i><b>Malkhut</b></i><b>.</b>",
            "<b>Similarly, the Torah as a whole is regarded as the mystical meaning of the structure of man, which is the mystical meaning of the 248 positive mitzvot, which correspond to the 248 limbs, and the 365 negative mitzvot, corresponding to the 365 sinews.</b> It <b>contains five parts, which are the mystical meaning of the five books of the Torah. This is called “the image of the chariot of the supernal man,” i.e., the man of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>, which is</b> <i><b>Bina</b></i><b>, from where these vessels begin to be drawn in the place of the souls. He is called “upper man” because there are three</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of man in the</b> <i><b>sefirot</b></i><b>, namely man of</b> <i><b>Beria</b></i><b>, man of</b> <i><b>Yetzira</b></i><b>, and man of</b> <i><b>Asiya</b></i><b>.

So, how can there be a letter representation of aspects of reality that are beyond any quantity? In contrast, from Bina and downward, the dynamics of quantity and structure do have a place, as the author of the Sulam explained previously, so it follows that there should be letter representations of those levels.

It is these lower aspects of the sefira that \"translate\" its dynamic into a receivable \"form\" for the ensuing lower levels.
