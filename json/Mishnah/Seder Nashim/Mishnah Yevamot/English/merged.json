            "Fifteen classes of women exempt their rivals and their rivals' rivals <i>ad infinitum</i> from <i>Chalitzah</i> [the ceremony releasing the widow of a childless man from the obligation of Levirate marriage] and <i>Yibum</i> [Levirate marriage wherein a man weds his childless brother's widow].  And these are they: His [the <i>Yavam's</i> - the surviving brother's] daughter, and his daughter's daughter, and his son's daughter, and his wife's daughter, and her [his wife's] son's daughter, and her [his wife's] daughter's daughter, and his mother-in-law, and his mother-in-law's mother, and his father-in-law's mother, and his maternal sister, and his mother's sister, and his wife's sister, and his maternal brother's wife, and the wife of his brother who was not alive [when the younger brother lived], and his daughter-in-law.  These exempt their rivals and their rivals' rivals from <i>Chalitzah</i> and from <i>Yibum</i> <i>ad infinitum</i>. [If] any of these [women] died, or refused [as adults to remain in marriages they were forced into as minors], or were divorced, or were found to be barren, their rivals are permitted [to the <i>Yavam</i>].  But regarding his mother-in-law, and his mother-in-law's mother, and his father-in-law's mother you cannot say that they were found to be barren or that they refused. ", 
            "How do they [these women] exempt their rivals? [If] one's daughter or any one of these <i>Arayot</i> [forbidden unions with relatives] was married to his brother who had another wife, and he died - then just like his daughter is exempt [from <i>Yibum</i> because one cannot marry one's daughter], so too is her rival exempt. [If] his daughter's rival went and married his second brother who had another wife and then he [the second brother] died - then just like his daughter's rival is exempt [from <i>Yibum</i>] so too is her rival's rival exempt, even if there are a hundred [brothers]. How is it to be understood that when these have died their rivals are permitted? [If] one's daughter, or any one of these <i>Arayot</i> was married to his brother who had another wife, and his daughter died, or was divorced, and subsequently his brother died, her rival is permitted.  And [if] a woman could have refused but did not refuse, her rival performs <i>Chalitzah</i> but does not undergo <i>Yibum</i>.", 
            "[There are] six <i>Arayot</i> [whose cases are] more stringent than these, because they are married to others their rivals are permitted.  His mother, and his father's wife, and his father's sister, and his paternal sister, and his father's brother's wife, and his paternal brother's wife.", 
            "Beit Shammai permit the rivals to the brothers [for marriage], but Beit Hillel forbid [them]. [If these women] had performed <i>Chalitzah</i> Beit Shammai disqualify them from [subsequently marrying] priests, but Beit Hillel allow them [to do so]. [If these women] had undergone <i>Yibum</i>, Beit Shammai permit them [to subsequently marry priests], but Beit Hillel disqualify them [from such a union]. Even though these [one school] prohibit and these [the other school] permit, these disqualify and these allow, Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel [refrain from marrying women] from Beit Shammai. [With regard to] purity and impurity where these ruled [a matter] pure and these ruled [it] impure, they did not refrain from using [utensils] the other deemed pure.  "

            "How [does] the wife of his brother who was not alive [release her rival]?  [If there were] two brothers and one dies [childless] and [a third] brother was born to them, following which the second brother marries his brother's wife [through <i>Yibum</i> - Levirate marriage wherein a man weds his childless brother's widow] and dies, then the first woman [the initial widow] goes out [without <i>Yibum</i> or <i>Chalitzah</i> - the ceremony releasing the widow of a childless man from the obligation of Levirate marriage] because she was the wife of his brother who was not alive [when the younger brother lived]; and the second [wife of the second brother is also exempt] because of her rival [the initial widow]. [If] he [the second brother] performed <i>Ma’amar</i> [betrothal through money or a document] and died, the second [wife of the second brother] performs <i>Chalitzah</i> but does not undergo <i>Yibum</i>.", 
            "[If there were] two brothers and one of them dies, and the second performs <i>Yibum</i> for his brother's wife, whereupon another [third] brother was born, and [the second brother] dies - the widow of the first brother goes out [without further ceremony] because she was the wife of his brother who was not alive, and the second [widow of the second brother goes out] since she is her [the initial widow's] rival. [If] he [the second brother] performed <i>Ma’amar</i> [for the initial widow] and died the second [wife of the second brother] performs <i>Chalitzah</i> but does not undergo <i>Yibum</i>.  Rabbi Shimon says: He [the third brother] performs <i>Yibum</i> for whomever of them he wants or undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> from whomever of them he wants.", 
            "They stated a rule with regard to a <i>Yevama</i> [a woman whose husband died childless and whose brother-in-law must marry or dismiss her]: [If] a woman is prohibited due to <i>Ervah</i> [a forbidden union with a relative] neither does she perform <i>Chalitzah</i> nor is <i>Yibum</i> performed for her. [If] a woman is prohibited due to [other, non-<i>Ervah</i>] prohibition commandments, or due to prohibitions of sanctity, she performs <i>Chalitzah</i> but <i>Yibum</i> is not performed for her. [If] her sister is her is her sister-in-law, she performs <i>Chalitzah</i> or <i>Yibum</i> is performed for her. ", 
            "A prohibition commandment [refers to] the secondary degrees [of <i>Arayot</i> forbidden unions] prohibited by rabbinic decree.  A prohibition due to sanctity [refers to] a widow [marrying] a high priest, a divorced woman or a <i>Chalutzah</i> [a woman who performs  <i>Chalitzah</i>, marrying] a common priest, a <i>Mamzeret</i> [the offspring of a severely prohibited union between a Jewish man and woman] or a <i>Netinah</i> [a member of a caste of Temple servants, historically descended from the Gibeonites, marrying] a Jew, and the daughter of a Jew [marrying] a a <i>Mamzer</i> or a <i>Netin</i>.

            "In every case where there is a surviving brother, though of illegitimate origin, the widow of the deceased brother of such a one becomes subject to the law of Yeboom; he also possesses all the rights of a brother, except when he is the son of a bondwoman, or of a strange [i.e. non-Israelite] woman. In every case where there is a son, that son releases his father's wife from the obligation of Yeboom, and even if illegitimate, is amenable to the penalties of the law against striking or cursing his father; he possesses, moreover, all the rights of a son, except he were the son of a bond-woman, or of a strange [i.e. non-Israelite] woman.", 
            "When a person has given ‏קדושין‎ [i.e. betrothing] to one of two sisters, and does no longer know to which of them he gave it, he must give ‏גט‎, i.e. a letter of divorce to each. If he left at his decease one brother only, that brother must cause both [sisters] to perform Chalitzah to him. If he left two brothers, one must have Chalitzah performed to him, and the other may marry the sister-in-law by Yeboom, but if these brothers had already married the sisters, in anticipation, they are not to be separated from them.", 
            "When two men [who are strangers to each other] have each of them betrothed one of two sisters, and neither of these men know which sister he has betrothed, then each man must give two Gets [letters of divorce] to the sisters. If [the men] died, and each left a brother, these brothers must have Chalitzah given to them by both sisters. If one of the men had one brother, and the other two, in the case of one brother only, he must have the Chalitzah performed by both sisters; and in that of the two brothers, one must have Chalitzah performed to him, and the other brother may marry his brother's widow by Yeboom, but if they had already married the sisters in anticipation, 5 they are not to be separated from them. If each man left two brothers, one brother of each pair must have Chalitzah performed to him by one of the sisters, and the other brother of each pair can then marry by Yeboom one of the sisters released by the Chalitzah performed to the other brother. If two brothers had already in anticipation received Chalitzah from the sisters, the latter are not to be separated from them.", 
            "It is proper that the eldest brother should perform the duty of Yeboom; yet, if it were done by a younger brother, the marriage is valid. When suspected of carnal intercourse with a bond-woman, or with a non-Israelite woman, he may not marry her, even after [the first mentioned] had been manumitted, or [the last mentioned] had become a proselyte, but if he did marry [any of these women], they shall not be separated; but if a person should be suspected of having had adulterous intercourse with a married woman, who, in consequence, had been separated from her husband judicially, then, even if the said suspected person had already married her, they must be separated.", 
            "A person who brings to a married woman a Get from her husband, from beyond sea, and declares that the said document was duly written and signed in his presence, may not marry that woman. If a person should say to a married woman, \"Thy husband is dead,\" or, \"I have murdered him,\" or, \"We have murdered him,\" such person may not marry that woman; R. Jehudah saith, \"If he says, 'I have murdered him,' the woman may not marry at all, but if he said, 'We have murdered him,' she may be married.\"", 
            "A ‏חכם‎ [i.e. one learned in the Holy Law] who had declared binding a vow made by a woman against her husband, may not marry her; but he may do so in case that woman appeared before him at the tribunal, and there expressed her refusal, or performed the ceremony of Chalitzah; and in all the above-mentioned cases, if the men were married at the time [of the prohibition], and their wives died since, they may marry the women prohibited to them before; also, in case these women had, meanwhile, been married to others, and were divorced, or had become widows, the females also prohibited to these men, may marry their sons or brothers."

            "When, of four brothers, two married two sisters, and they who had married the sisters, died: the sisters must give Chalitzah, but may not be married to the brothers-in-law by Yeboom; and if they had prematurely married them, they must send them away. R. Eleazar saith, \"According to Beth Shammai such a marriage is valid; but according to Beth Hillel, they must be separated.\"", 
            "If one of these sisters is prohibited to marry one of the brothers, owing to a prohibited degree of relationship between them, [although] he may not marry her, yet may he marry her sister, and both sisters are prohibited to the other brother. If one of these sisters is prohibited only on account of legal prohibition [by the Rabbins], or of holiness of station, she must perform Chalitzah, but he may not marry her by Yeboom.", 
            "When one of the sisters is prohibited to marry one brother, and another sister the other brother, owing to prohibited degrees of relationship between them, then she who is prohibited to one brother, may marry the other; and this is the case to which allusion was made [above] where [it] is said, \"When, of two sisters, one only can be [lawfully] married by Yeboom, she must either perform the ceremony of Chalitzah, or be married by Yeboom.\"",

R. Simeon releases them from the obligation of Chalitzah. If any of these could not be married [to the third brother] on account of prohibited degree of relationship to him, he may not [indeed] marry her; but he may marry her sister. If one of the sisters is prohibited to him, only on account of legal prohibition [by the Rabbins], or on account of holiness of station, she must perform Chalitzah to him, but he may not marry her by Yeboom.",

To this case was the remark applied: \"Unhappy he, for [the loss of] his wife, and unhappy he, for [the loss of] his sister-in-law.\"", 
            "When, of three brothers, two are married to two sisters, and one to a stranger: if one of them who married the sisters died, and the brother who had married the stranger marries the widow, and then also dies, the first widow is released, as sister of his wife and the second as her rival, but if he [i.e. the second deceased] had only promised marriage to the widow, the stranger must perform the ceremony of Chalitzah; but the brother-in-law may not marry her by Yeboom. When, of three brothers, two married two sisters, and the third a stranger: should the brother who married the stranger die, and one of those who had married the sisters, marries the widow, and also dies, the one widow is free, as being a wife's sister, and the other as her rival; but if he only promised marriage to the stranger, and then dies, she must perform Chalitzah, and may not be married to her brother-in-law by Yeboom.", 
            "When, of three brothers, two are married to two sisters, and one to a stranger: if one of them who married the sisters died, and he who had married the stranger marries the widow, and then the wife of the second brother dies, and also the third brother, who had married the stranger, then the widow will be for ever prohibited to the second, or surviving brother, because she was for some time prohibited to him [as wife's sister]. When, of three brothers, two were married to two sisters, and one to a stranger, if it should happen that one of those married to the sisters, divorced his wife; and that the brother married to the stranger died, and the widow was married to the brother who gave the divorce, and that this latter also died, then the following rule becomes applicable: namely, that in all cases where the husbands died, or when the woman had been divorced, their rivals are permitted to marry.", 
            "In all [the mentioned fifteen classes where the Kedushin, or divorce, is doubtful, the ceremony of Chalitzah must be performed by their rivals; but these may not be married by Yeboom. What is meant by a doubtful kedushin [betrothment]? When the man threw the marriage-bond, and it is uncertain whether it fell nearest to him or to her, 10 then it is a doubtful betrothment. A doubtful divorce is,—when the husband did himself write the letter of divorce, without the signature of witnesses, or that it was signed by witnesses, but with the omission of date, or when it is properly dated, but attested by one witness only,—then is it a doubtful divorce.", 
            "When three brothers have married three strangers [i.e. not related to each other], and one of the brothers died, and the second brother promises marriage to the widow, and dies: the woman must perform Chalitzah to the surviving brother, but he may not marry them by Yeboom, for it is said (Deut. xxv. 5), \"Her husband's brother shall go in unto her,\" &amp;c., i.e. her who reverts to him by the death of one of his brothers, but not her who reverts to him by the death of two brothers. R. Simeon saith, \"He may marry either, and must have the ceremony of Chalitzah performed to him by the other.\" When, of two brothers married to two sisters, one dies, and afterwards the wife of the surviving brother also dies, then he may never marry his brother's widow; because, there was a time when she was prohibited to him, [namely, during the life of his wife, her sister.]",

            "In the case of property accruing to a woman, whilst waiting to be married by Yeboom, the schools of Shammai and Hillel agree, that she is entitled to sell it or give it away. How are they to act in case of the death of such a woman, with the amount of her dowry to which she is entitled by her Ketubah, and the private property she brings in with her [on her marriage], and takes back again [in case of divorce]? Beth Shammai decide, that it must be divided between her husband's, and her father's heirs. But Beth Hillel teach, that her private property remains in its existing power, her marriage portion in that of the heirs of her husband, and the property she brings and takes back with her, in that of her father's heirs.", 
            "As soon as a brother-in-law has married a woman by Yeboom [and consummated the marriage], she must be considered as his wife in every respect, except that the portion allowed her in her marriage contract is to be charged on her late husband's property.", 
            "The duty of Yeboom is obligatory in the first place on the eldest brother; should he refuse, all the other brothers must be applied to; if they also refuse, they must apply again to the eldest, and say unto him, \"The obligation is incumbent on you, [therefore] either receive Chalitzah from your sister-in-law, or marry her by Yeboom.\"",

            "A person who received Chalitzah from his sister-in-law, remains in respect to the inheritance [of his deceased brother's property] upon an equal footing with his other brothers; but if their father is yet alive, he inherits it; but he that married his sister-in-law by Yeboom acquires thereby all his brother's property. R. Jehudah saith, \"In either case, should the father still be alive, the property devolves on him.\" When a person has received Chalitzah from his sister-in-law, he may not marry her relations, nor she his. He may not marry her mother, nor her grandmother [whether her mother's or her father's mother], her daughter, or grand-daughter, whether of son or of daughter, or her sister, whilst she is alive. His brothers may marry her, but she may not marry his father, nor his grandfather, whether his father's or mother's father, his son, his son's son, his brother, or his brother's son. It is lawful, however, to marry the relations of the rival of the woman from whom a person has received Chalitzah, but not the rivals of the relation of the woman from whom he received Chalitzah.",

            "In case the sister of a woman in expectation of being married by Yeboom to her brother-in-law, should meanwhile have been betrothed to another brother, it is taught in the name of R. Jehudah ben Beterah that they shall admonish him to delay his marriage until the elder brother proceeds to an act [i.e. that of Yeboom or of Chalitzah]. As soon as he [the elder brother] has received Chalitzah from, or married his sister-in-law by Yeboom, the other brother may marry his betrothed also, in case the widow should have died; but if the brother-in-law died, he must divorce his betrothed and receive Chalitzah from his sister-in-law.", 
            "Women who have become subject to Yeboom, may not proceed to it or to the ceremony of Chalitzah until after three months have elapsed [since the death of their husbands], other women also shall not be betrothed nor married [again] till after three months, whether they were virgins or not, whether divorced or widowed, married or only betrothed. R. Jehudah says, \"Women who had already been married may be betrothed immediately, and the betrothed ones married, except the betrothed in Judah, for there the intercourse of the bridegroom with his betrothed is less restrained.\" R. José says, \"All women may be immediately betrothed, except a widow, on account of the mourning [she is bound to observe for her deceased husband].\"", 
            "When four [of a number of] brethren die, who had been married to four women, the eldest [survivor] may marry all four by Yeboom, if he wishes it. If a person left two wives at his decease, the marriage by Yeboom or Chalitzah by one, releases her rival. If one is qualified to be married to a priest, and the other is not; if the brother-in-law receives Chalitzah, he must receive it of her who may not be married to a priest; but if he prefers to marry by Yeboom, he can take her who is qualified [to be married to a priest].",

Akivah; but the sages say they are not bastards: they agree, however, that the child of one who had married a relation of the woman from whom he received Chalitzah is a bastard.", 
            "What's the definition of a mamzer?  [The offspring of a union with] someone who shares the same flesh who the Torah forbids to you, according to Rabbi Akiva.  Shimon the Yemenite says, a mamzer is  [the offspring resulting from] any [sexual] prohibition that carries the penalty of excision by the Hand of Heaven [\"kareit\"].  The halacha is according to Shimon the Yemenite.  Rabbi Joshua says, any [offspring resulting from a union] where there is a penalty of death by the court.  Rabbi Simon the son of Azai said, \"I found that it was written in the scroll where the courts would record the lineages of the families of Jerusalem that someone is a mamzer if he is the offspring of a married woman [and a man other than her husband], supporting the words of Rabbi Joshua.  \n\nIf a man's wife died, he is permitted to marry her sister.  If they divorced, and then the wife died, he is permitted to marry her sister.  If [they divorced and] the wife married another, and then the former wife died, he is permitted to marry his former wife's sister.

Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Simon permit her to eat teruma after the first stage of the wedding ceremony as long as she has not had sex yet.  If these women become widowed or divorced from their subsequent marriages, they are not eligible to eat teruma, but if they became widowed or divorced from someone with whom they were betrothed, they may still eat teruma.",

He must not marry a woman who was hit by a woodstick [in her genitals, so as to break the hymene]. If he has betrothed a widow and [afterwards] is elected High Priest, he must not consume the marriage. But it happened that Yoshua, the son of Gamla, betrothed Marta, the daughter of Baytos, and the king elected him High Priest, and he consumed the marriage with her. If a woman who has to perform levirate falls upon a Priest and he is elected High Priest, even if he has made a promis of marriage to her, he must not consume the marriage with her. A High Priest, if his [older] brother [with no descendants] dies, must perform Chalitzah and not levirate marriage.",

Beit Hillel say, A male and a female, as it is written, \"Male and female He created them\" (Gen. 5:2).  If he married a woman, and stayed with her ten years, and she did not bear children - he may not abstain.  If he divorced her - she is permitted to marry another.  And the second may stay with her ten years.  And if she miscarried, he counts from the time that she miscarried.  Man is commanded to be \"fruitful and multiply,\" but not woman.  Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says, Regarding both it states, \"And God blessed them, and God said to them: 'Be fruitful and multiply'\" (Gen. 1:28)."

The term \"usufructum slaves,\" denotes, that the loss of these slaves by death, or the profit that may accrue from them by their increase, are entirely at the risk, or for the advantage of the wife; and, therefore, although the husband is bound to maintain them, yet they may not eat of his heave-offering. Slaves which are as an \"iron flock,\" are such, whose death is the husband's loss, or their increase his profit; and as he has thus the entire risk of them, they may eat of the heave-offering [as if they had been bought by him].",

Such is the dictum of R. Josh; but the sages argued against this, and said unto him, \"[If so] even as you affirm this in respect to an Israelite woman married to a priest, thus also, even if she were a priest's daughter married to a priest, and had been left pregnant by him at his decease, ought also not to be allowed to eat of the heave, on account of the share of the unborn infant?\" [Because the slaves are the property of the unborn infant as being the heir; and, according to R.

If an Israelite had relations with the daughter of a kohen, she may still continue to eat terumah. Iif she gets pregnant, she may no longer eat terumah. If the fetus was aborted in her womb, she may eat. But if she gave birth to a child, she may eat. The power of the son is thus greater than the father's power. A slave deprives a woman, due to his cohabitation, from eating terumah, but not as her offspring. How so? If the daughter of an Israelite was wed to a kohen, or if the daughter of a kohen was married to an Israelite, and she had a son by him, and that son went and violated a bondswoman who had a son by him, such a son is a slave. And if his paternal grandmother was a bat yisrael (daughter of an Israelite) married to a kohen (priest), she is not allowed to eat terumah. But if she were a bat kohen (priest's daughter) and married to an Israelite, she may eat terumah. A mamzer (bastard, illegitimate child) deprives a woman from eating terumah, and also bestows the privilege on her? How so? If an Israelite's daughter was married to a kohen, or a kohen's daughter was married to an Israelite, and she bore him a daughter, and the daughter married a slave or idolater, and had a son by him, the son is a mamzer.

Rabbi Akiva said:  I will explain it: a man-made eunuch performs halitzah and halitzah is also performed for his wife, because there was a time when he was fit [to have children]. A eunuch by nature neither performs halitzah nor is halitzah performed for his wife, since there never was a time when he was fit.  Rabbi Eliezer said: Not so!  Rather a eunuch by nature performs halitzah and halitzah is performed for his wife, because he may be cured. A man-made eunuch neither performs halitzah nor is halitzah performed for his wife, since he cannot be cured.

If he has intercourse with her he disqualifies her, since this is an act of fornication.

Rabbi Judah stated: if a tumtum (one with no apparrent gender) was opened up and found to be a male, he may not perform halitzah, because he has the same status as a eunuch.

He is also free from the payment of the two cheeks, the shoulder, and maw of his own sacrifice [to the priests]; and his firstborn cattle must be left to pasture till it contracts a legal blemish, and the most stringent regulations [regarding sacrifices] of priests and Israelites, are to be applied in respect to his sacrifices. If both [the husbands of his mother] were priests, he is bound [in case of death] to mourn for them, and they for him; he may not defile himself with their dead bodies, nor may they defile themselves with his; he is no heir to them, but they inherit his property. The punishment attached to the crime of striking, or cursing a father, cannot be inflicted on him. He may serve in the priests' division of service at the Temple, of one and of the other, but he does not participate in the share of either, but if both belonged to one division [‏משמרה‎], he is entitled to one share."

The Chalitzah is also valid when it is performed with a sandal which has a leather strap at the heel, but not if it is not furnished with such a strap. If it is tied under the knee, it is valid, but not if it was tied above the knee.", 
            "If Chalitzah was performed with a sandal which does not belong to the man, or with a wooden sandal [covered with leather], or on the right foot, with a sandal belonging to the left foot, it is valid. If with a sandal which is too large, but with which the man may walk nevertheless, or with one too small [to cover the whole foot], but which nevertheless covers the greater part of the foot, the Chalitzah is valid. If that ceremony was performed at night it is valid, but R. Eleazar declares it void. A Chalitzah performed on the left foot is void, but R. Eleazar declares it to he valid.",

Eleazar; but valid according to R. Akivah. R. Eleazar thus expounds the text (Deut. xxv. 9), \"Thus shall it be done,\" &amp;c. viz. \"All acts there prescribed must be performed, and the omission of any renders the Chalitzah void.\" But R. Akivah replied, \"The same text affords a proof of my opinion, for it is there stated, 'Thus shall it be done to the man;' which proves that it only relates to the acts of the man.\"",

Then shall she answer and say, \"So shall it be done with the man that will not build up his brother's house\" (Deut. xxv. 9). Thus far was it read formerly, but when R. Hyrcanus had the whole passage read under an oak in the village Atam [‏עיטם‎], it became customary ever after to read the whole section. The injunction of the law (Deut. xxv. 16), \"His name shall be called in Israel the house of him that hath his shoe loosened,\" is obligatory on the judges only, but not on the disciples present; but according to R.

According to Beth Shammai [the right of refusal] is only available against the husband, but not against the brother-in-law [in case of Yeboom]; but Beth Hillel permit it against either. Beth Shammai will only allow [the refusal] when it was made in the presence of the husband; but Beth Hillel permit it in his absence, as well as in his presence. Beth Shammai require the refusal to be made [formally] before a Beth Din [tribunal]; but Beth Hillel consider a refusal not made before a tribunal sufficient. Beth Hillel said to Beth Shammai, \"A girl may thus, during her minority, refuse four or five men.\" But the school of Shammai replied, \"The daughters of Israel are not to be thus loosely dealt with, therefore, as soon as such a girl expressed her refusal, she must wait [to be again betrothed] till she has attained her majority, or expressed her refusal of the man to whom she is betrothed, and marries another immediately.",

Eleazar saith, \"The act of a minor is a nullity, and such a girl can only be considered in the same light as one who had been seduced.

If he divorced her, and then desired to take her back, when she formally refused him, and married another from whom she was subsequently separated, or became a widow, the first husband may take her back; but if she had expressed her refusal, and the man took her again and then divorced her, upon which she was married to another, and became a widow, or was divorced, then the first husband may not take her back; the rule is when a Get was given after a declaration of refusal, he may not take her back, but he may do so if the refusal was posterior to the Get in point of time.",

            "R. Akivah says, \"When I went down to Neardeah to intercalate a month in the year, I met Nehemiah of Beth-delee, who told me, 'I heard that with the exception of R. Jehudah ben Baba, permission is refused in the Holy Land to a woman to re-marry upon the evidence of a single witness.' On my answering in the affirmative, he said, 'Tell them in my name you are aware that the tranquillity of this country is disturbed by armed hosts, [and therefore I cannot go to tender my personal evidence], but I have it in tradition from the elder Rabbon Gamaliel, that a woman may re-marry on the evidence of a single witness, or of that of a woman or slave.' When I returned and informed [the younger] Rabbon Gamaliel of this, he rejoiced and said, 'We have found a colleague for R. Jehudah ben Baba, [who agrees with him in this].' That circumstance reminded Rabbon Gamaliel [the younger], that once, when several men were killed at Tel Arzah, Rabbon Gamaliel, the elder, permitted their wives to re-marry on the evidence of a single witness, and to receive as valid evidence the testimony of a witness, whose knowledge of the fact is only derived from the deposition he heard another witness make in this case, also, [to grant this permission to re-marry] on the evidence of a slave-woman, or female slave.\" R. Eleazar and R. Joshua are, however, of opinion, that the mentioned permission ought not to be granted to a woman to re-marry upon the evidence of a single witness. R. Akivah saith, \"Neither upon that of a woman, a slave, a bond-woman, or of near relatives.\" But the sages said unto him, \"It happened once, that when a family of Levites went to Zoar, the city of Palms, one [of the said Levites] fell ill on the road, and they brought him to an inn. When they returned, they asked the hostess, 'Where is our companion?'—She answered, 'He died, and I have had him buried': permission was thereupon granted the wife of the deceased to re-marry.\" They [the sages] said [moreover] to him, \"Shall not the evidence of a woman of sacerdotal race be equally admissible as that of the [heathen] hostess of an inn?\" but he replied, \"The reason why credence was accorded to this hostess was, because she produced to them the staff of the deceased, his travelling-bag, and the roll of the law he carried with him.\""
