            "Fifteen classes of women exempt their rivals and their rivals' rivals <i>ad infinitum</i> from <i>Chalitzah</i> [the ceremony releasing the widow of a childless man from the obligation of Levirate marriage] and <i>Yibum</i> [Levirate marriage wherein a man weds his childless brother's widow].  And these are they: His [the <i>Yavam</i> - the surviving brother's] daughter, and his daughter's daughter, and his son's daughter, and his wife's daughter, and her [his wife's] son's daughter, and her [his wife's] daughter's daughter, and his mother-in-law, and his mother-in-law's mother, and his father-in-law's mother, and his maternal sister, and his mother's sister, and his wife's sister, and his maternal brother's wife, and the wife of his brother who was not alive [when the younger brother lived], and his daughter-in-law.  These exempt their rivals and their rivals' rivals from <i>Chalitzah</i> and from <i>Yibum</i> <i>ad infinitum</i>. [If] any of these [women] died, or refused [as adults to remain in marriages they were forced into as minors], or were divorced, or were found to be barren, their rivals are permitted [to the <i>Yavam</i>].  But regarding his mother-in-law, and his mother-in-law's mother, and his father-in-law's mother you cannot say that they were found to be barren or that they refused. ",
            "How do they [these women] exempt their rivals? [If] one's daughter or any one of these forbidden unions was married to his brother who had another wife, and he died - then just like his daughter is exempt [from <i>Yibum</i> because one cannot marry one's daughter], so too is her rival exempt. [If] his daughter's rival went and married his second brother who had another wife and then he [the second brother] died - then just like his daughter's rival is exempt [from <i>Yibum</i>] so too is her rival's rival exempt, even if there are a hundred [brothers]. How is it to be understood that when these have died their rivals are permitted? [If] one's daughter, or any one of these forbidden unions was married to his brother who had another wife, and his daughter died, or was divorced, and subsequently his brother died, her rival is permitted.  And [if] a woman could have refused but did not refuse, her rival performs <i>Chalitzah</i> but does not undergo <i>Yibum</i>.",
            "[There are] six forbidden unions [whose cases are] more stringent than these, because they are married to others their rivals are permitted.  His mother, and his father's wife, and his father's sister, and his paternal sister, and his father's brother's wife, and his paternal brother's wife.",
            "Beit Shammai permit the rivals to the brothers [for marriage], but Beit Hillel forbid [them]. [If these women] had performed <i>Chalitzah</i> Beit Shammai disqualify them from [subsequently marrying] priests, but Beit Hillel allow them [to do so]. [If these women] had undergone <i>Yibum</i>, Beit Shammai permit them [to subsequently marry priests], but Beit Hillel disqualify them [from such a union]. Even though these [one school] prohibit and these [the other school] permit, these disqualify and these allow, Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel [refrain from marrying women] from Beit Shammai. [With regard to] purity and impurity where these ruled [a matter] pure and these ruled [it] impure, they did not refrain from using [utensils] the other deemed pure.  "

            "How [does] the wife of his brother who was not alive [release her rival]?  [If there were] two brothers and one dies [childless] and [a third] brother was born to them, following which the second brother performs <i>Yibum</i> [Levirate marriage wherein a man weds his childless brother's widow] for his brother's wife and dies, then the first woman [the initial widow] goes out [without <i>Yibum</i> or <i>Chalitzah</i> - the ceremony releasing the widow of a childless man from the obligation of Levirate marriage] because she was the wife of his brother who was not alive [when the younger brother lived]; and the second [wife of the second brother is also exempt] because of her rival [the initial widow]. [If] he [the second brother] performed <i>Ma’amar</i> [semi-betrothal of a <i>Yevama</i> through money or a document] and died, the second [wife of the second brother] performs <i>Chalitzah</i> but does not undergo <i>Yibum</i>.",

[If] he [the second brother] performed <i>Ma’amar</i> [for the initial widow] and died the second [wife of the second brother] performs <i>Chalitzah</i> but does not undergo <i>Yibum</i>.  Rabbi Shimon says: He [the third brother] performs <i>Yibum</i> for whomever of them he wants or undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> from whomever of them he wants.",
            "They stated a rule with regard to a <i>Yevama</i> [a woman whose husband died childless and whose brother-in-law must marry or dismiss her]: [If] a woman is prohibited due to <i>Ervah</i> [a forbidden union with a relative] neither does she perform <i>Chalitzah</i> nor is <i>Yibum</i> performed for her. [If] a woman is prohibited due to [another, non-<i>Ervah</i>] prohibition commandment, or due to a prohibition of sanctity, she performs <i>Chalitzah</i> but <i>Yibum</i> is not performed for her. [If] her sister is her sister-in-law, she performs <i>Chalitzah</i> or <i>Yibum</i> is performed for her. ",
            "A prohibition commandment [refers to] the secondary degrees [of  forbidden unions] prohibited by rabbinic decree.  A prohibition due to sanctity [refers to] a widow [marrying] a high priest, a divorced woman or a <i>Chalutzah</i> [a woman who performs  <i>Chalitzah</i>, marrying] a common priest, a <i>Mamzeret</i> [the offspring of a severely prohibited union between a Jewish man and woman] or a <i>Netinah</i> [a member of a caste of Temple servants historically descended from the Gibeonites, marrying] a Jew, and the daughter of a Jew [marrying] a <i>Mamzer</i> or a <i>Netin</i>.

            "[If] one has any kind of a brother [even a <i>Mamzer</i>] he [such a brother] binds his [dead] brother's wife to <i>Yibum</i>.

[If] one has any kind of a son [even a <i>Mamzer</i>] he exempts his father's wife from <i>Yibum</i>; and he is liable for striking him [his father] or cursing him [his father].  And he is his son with regard to all matters, except when one has [a son] from a bondwoman, or from a gentile woman.",
            "[If] one betrothed one of two sisters, but does not know which of them he betrothed, he gives a bill of divorce to this one and a bill of divorce to that one. If he died and he had one brother, he [that brother] undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> from both [women]. If he had two brothers, one undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> [from one woman] and one performs <i>Yibum</i> [with the other woman]. [If] they went ahead and married [the sisters] they [the women] are not removed from them.",
            "[If] two men betrothed two sisters and this one [one of them] does not know which he betrothed, and this one [the other]  does not know which one he betrothed, this one gives two bills of divorce [one to each woman] and this one gives two bills of divorce. If they [the men] died and this one had a brother and this one had a brother, this one undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> from both women, and this one undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> from both women. If one of [the men] had one [brother], and the other had two [brothers] the lone bother undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> from both women; and [with regard] to the two - one undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> [from one woman] and one performs <i>Yibum</i> [with the other woman].

[If] this one had two [brothers] and this one had two [brothers], the brother of this one undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> from one woman and the brother of this one [the other man] undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> from one woman.  The brother of this one performs <i>Yibum</i> with the <i>Chalutzah</i> of this one, and the brother of this one [the other man] performs <i>Yibum</i> with the <i>Chalutzah</i> of this one. [If] the two [brothers of one man] went ahead and underwent <i>Chalitzah</i> the two [brothers of the other man] should not perform <i>Yibum</i>, rather one of them undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> and one of them performs <i>Yibum</i>.  If they [the brothers of the second man] went ahead and married them [following the <i>Chalitzah</i> of the two] they are not removed from them.",
            "It is the obligation for the eldest brother to perform <i>Yibum</i>; however, if the younger [brother] went ahead [and did it] he has merited [the <i>Mitzvah</i>]. [If] one was accused of [having relations] with a bondwoman and she was [subsequently] freed, or with a gentile woman and she [subsequently] converted, he may not marry her.  But if he did she is not removed from him.  [If] one was accused of [having relations] with a married woman, and [consequently] she is removed from him [her husband], even if he [the suspected adulterer] marries [her], he must divorce [her].",
            "[If] a person brings a bill of divorce from overseas and states, \"It was written before me and it was signed before me\", he [the messenger] may not marry his wife [the woman named in the divorce].  [If a person testified that a man is] \"dead\", or \"I killed him\", or \"we killed him\", he may not marry his wife [the woman he is addressing]. Rabbi Yehudah says: [If he says] \"I killed him\" he may not marry his wife; [but if he says] \"we killed him\" he may marry his wife.",

And in all [the above mentioned cases] if they had wives [at the time of the cases] and they [their wives subsequently] died, they are allowed to marry them. And in all [the above mentioned cases if the women] married others [following their cases] and then got divorced or became widowed, they [the messenger, the witness or the sage] are allowed to marry them.

            "Who is the minor who is required to refuse?  Any girl whose mother and brother married her off with her knowledge.  [If] they married her off without her knowledge she does not require refusal. Rabbi Chanina ben Antignos says: Any child who is incapable of looking after her betrothal [money] does not require refusal.  Rabbi Eliezer says: The act of a minor is meaningless and [such a girl is considered] as one who has been seduced.
