            "What's the definition of a mamzer?  [The offspring of a union with] someone who shares the same flesh who the Torah forbids to you, according to Rabbi Akiva.  Shimon the Yemenite says, a mamzer is  [the offspring resulting from] any [sexual] prohibition that carries the penalty of excision by the Hand of Heaven [\"kareit\"].  The halacha is according to Shimon the Yemenite.  Rabbi Joshua says, any [offspring resulting from a union] where there is a penalty of death by the court.  Rabbi Simon the son of Azai said, \"I found that it was written in the scroll where the courts would record the lineages of the families of Jerusalem that someone is a mamzer if he is the offspring of a married woman [and a man other than her husband], supporting the words of Rabbi Joshua.  \n\nIf a man's wife died, he is permitted to marry her sister.  If they divorced, and then the wife died, he is permitted to marry her sister.  If [they divorced and] the wife married another, and then the former wife died, he is permitted to marry his former wife's sister.  If he performed the ritual of yevamot with a woman, and that woman died, he is permitted to marry that woman's sister.  If he performed the ritual of chalitza with a woman and then she died, he is permitted to marry that woman's sister."

[This is so] even [if] he [acted] unknowingly and she [acted] knowingly, [or] he [acted] knowingly and she [acted] unknowingly, [or] he [acted] by force and she did not [act] by force, [or] she [acted] by force and he did not [act] by force.  [This is so] whether he did not complete the intercourse or he did complete the intercourse.  And it makes no difference whether there was [natural] relations or [unnatural] relations. ",
            "Similarly, [if] one had relations with any of those with whom such unions are forbidden by the Torah, or with a woman who is disqualified for him - such as a widow to a High Priest or a divorced woman or a <i>Chalutzah</i> [a woman who performs <i>Chalitzah</i>] to a common priest, or a <i>Mamzeret</i> [the offspring of a severely prohibited union between a Jewish man and woman] or a <i>Netinah</i> [a member of a caste of Temple servants historically descended from the Gibeonites] to a Jew, she is disqualified [from later marrying a priest].

Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon allow her [to eat <i>Terumah</i>].  If they [these women] become widowed or divorced [from these priests] following marriage they are disqualified [from marrying priests]; if they [become widowed or divorced] following betrothal they are permitted [to marry priests].

[If] he has betrothed a widow and [subsequently] is elected High Priest, he may marry [her]. It once happened that Yehoshua ben Gamla betrothed Marta bat Baytos, and the king appointed him High Priest, and he married her. If a woman who was a <i>Shomeret Yavam</i> [the widow of a childless man whose brother-in-law has not yet married her nor released her from the obligation of Levirate marriage] was awaiting [<i>Yibum</i> - Levirate marriage wherein a man weds his childless brother's widow] from a common priest and he was appointed High Priest, he may not marry her even if he's performed <i>Ma’amar</i> [semi-betrothal of a <i>Yevama</i> widow through money or a document].

Rabbi Yehudah says: He may not marry an <i>aiylonit</i> even if he [already] has a wife and children because she is the <i>zonah</i> mentioned in the Torah.  But the Sages say: By <i>zonah</i> the Torah refers to a convert, or a freed maidservant, or a woman who had licentious relations.",
            "One may not abstain from procreation unless he [already] has children.  Beit Shammai say: [One must have] two boys, and Beit Hillel say: [One must have] a boy and a girl, as it says, \"Male and female He created them\" (Bereishit 5:2).  [If] one married a woman and waited for ten years and she did not bear children, he is not permitted to abstain [from his obligation].  [If] he divorced her she is permitted to marry somebody else, and the second [husband] is permitted to wait ten years with her.  And if she miscarries he counts [ten years] from the point she miscarried. A man is commanded to procreate but a woman is not.  Rabbi Yochanan ben Beroka says: It states to both of them, \"And God blessed them and He said to them... be fruitful and multiply\" (Bereishit 1:25)."

If a house collapses on a man and on his brother's daughter and it is unknown who died first, the rival must perform chalitza but does not contract levirate marriage.",
            "The rapist, the seducer, and the mentally incompetent can neither deprive a woman of the right of eating terumah, nor can they grant the right upon her. If, however, they are unfit to enter into the assembly of Israel, they do deprive a woman of her right to eat terumah. How so? If an Israelite had relations with the daughter of a kohen, she may still continue to eat terumah. Iif she gets pregnant, she may no longer eat terumah. If the fetus was aborted in her womb, she may eat. But if she gave birth to a child, she may eat. The power of the son is thus greater than the father's power. A slave deprives a woman, due to his cohabitation, from eating terumah, but not as her offspring. How so? If the daughter of an Israelite was wed to a kohen, or if the daughter of a kohen was married to an Israelite, and she had a son by him, and that son went and violated a bondswoman who had a son by him, such a son is a slave. And if his paternal grandmother was a bat yisrael (daughter of an Israelite) married to a kohen (priest), she is not allowed to eat terumah. But if she were a bat kohen (priest's daughter) and married to an Israelite, she may eat terumah. A mamzer (bastard, illegitimate child) deprives a woman from eating terumah, and also bestows the privilege on her? How so? If an Israelite's daughter was married to a kohen, or a kohen's daughter was married to an Israelite, and she bore him a daughter, and the daughter married a slave or idolater, and had a son by him, the son is a mamzer. If his maternal grandmother was a bat yisrael  (daughter of an Israelite) married to a kohen, she may eat terumah. But if she was a kohen's daughter married to an Israelite, she may not eat terumah.

They [the Sages] said to him: If this is a received tradition we shall accept it, but if it is only a logical inference there is a refutation. He replied: No!

Rabbi Akiva said: I will explain it: a man-eunuch [castrated by a person] undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> and one undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> for his wife because there was a time when he was fit [to have children]; a sun-eunuch [who was born that way] does not undergo <i>Chalitzah</i> nor does one undergo <i>Chalitzah</i> for his wife since there was never a time when he was fit.

Rabbi Yehoshua ben Betiera testified concerning Ben Megusat who was a man-eunuch in Jerusalem and they performed <i>Yibum</i> [Levirate marriage wherein a man weds his childless brother's widow] for his wife, to uphold the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.

[If] a eunuch underwent <i>Chalitzah</i> from his <i>Yevama</i> [a woman whose husband died childless and whose brother-in-law must marry or dismiss her] he does not disqualify her [from subsequently marrying a priest].  If he had relations with her he does disqualify her since this is licentious relations [because she is forbidden to him].  Similarly, [if] brothers underwent <i>Chalitzah</i> from <i>aiylonit</i> they do not disqualify her [from marrying a priest].  If they had relations with her they do disqualify her since this is licentious relations. ",

Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon said: [If] a priest who was an <i>androginos</i> [person with both male and female sexual organs. It is halachically uncertain whether such a person is male, female or, perhaps, has a uniquely defined halachic gender] married the daughter of an Israelite, he confers upon her the right to eat <i>Terumah</i> . Rabbi Yehudah said: [If] a <i>tumtum</i> [person with recessed sexual organs whose gender is therefore impossible to determine, presently, by external examination. It is halachically uncertain whether such a person is male or female] was torn and found to be male he may not undergo <i>Chalitzah</i> because he is like a eunuch.

If he [the uncertain son] has brothers from the first [husband] and brothers from the second [husband] who are not from the same mother, he undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> or performs <i>Yibum</i>, and [if he dies] one of them undergoes <i>Chalitzah</i> and one performs <i>Yibum</i>.",
            "[If] one [of the two husbands of the woman with the uncertain child] is an Israelite and the other is a priest, the [uncertain] son may [only] marry a wife eligible for a priest. He may not become impure through [contact with] a corpse, but if he does become impure he does not endure the forty [lashes], and he may not eat <i>Terumah</i>, but if he does he does not repay the principal or the fifth. And he does not receive a share [of <i>Terumah</i>] at the threshing floor, and he sells the <i>Terumah</i> [from his own crops to certain priests] and keeps the revenue himself.  And he does not receive a share from the consecrated Temple items, nor does he give them consecrated things, and they do not take away his [sacrifices] from him, and he is exempt from the shoulder, and the cheeks, and the maw [donations given to priests]. And his firstborn [animal] grazes until it becomes blemished.  And stringencies of priests and stringencies of Israelites are placed upon him. [If] both [husbands] are priests, he [the uncertain son] has the status of an <i>Onen</i> [a person whose close relative has died but has not yet been buried] for them [if they die] and they have the status of an <i>Onen</i> for him [if he dies].  He may not become impure for them and they may not become impure for him. He does not inherit from them but they do inherit from him. He is exempt if he strikes either one or if he curses either one. And he participates in the priestly shift of this one and the priestly shift of this one.  And he does not share [in either shift's portions], but if both [uncertain fathers] are in the same shift he does receive a portion. "

            "The  <i>Mitzvah</i> of <i>Chalitzah</i> [the ceremony releasing the widow of a childless man from the obligation of Levirate marriage, takes place before a court of] three judges, even if the three are laymen. If she performs <i>Chalitzah</i> with a shoe her <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid, but [if she used] a cloth slipper her <i>Chalitzah</i> is invalid. [If it was done] with a sandal which has a heel it is valid, but with no heel - it is not valid.  [If she untied the shoe's straps] from the knee and below - her <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid, [but] if from the knee and above - her <i>Chalitzah</i> is invalid.",
            "[If] she performed <i>Chalitzah</i> with a sandal which is not his [the <i>Yavam</i> - one upon whom has fallen the obligation to perform Levirate marriage], or with a sandal of wood, or with the left [sandal worn] on the right foot - her <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid. [If] she performed <i>Chalitzah</i> with [a sandal] which was too large [for him] but with which he was able to walk [anyway], or with one too small [for him], but which [nevertheless] covers most of his foot, her <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid. [If] she performed <i>Chalitzah</i> at night her <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid, but Rabbi Eliezer deems it invalid. [If] she performed <i>Chalitzah</i> on his left [foot] her <i>Chalitzah</i> is invalid, but R. Eliezer deems it valid.",
            "[If] she performed <i>Chalitzah</i> and spat [before the <i>Yavam</i>], but did not read [the verses associated with the ceremony], her <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid.  [If] she read [the text] and spat but did not perform <i>Chalitzah</i> [loosen his shoe] her <i>Chalitzah</i> is invalid.  [If] she performed <i>Chalitzah</i> and read [the text] but did not spit - Rabbi Eliezer says: Her <i>Chalitzah</i> is invalid; [but] Rabbi Akiva says: Her <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid. Rabbi Eliezer said [interpreted the words], \"So shall it be done\" (Devarim 25:9), [implies that] all actions are critical.  Rabbi Akiva said to him: [Will you bring] a proof from there? [Does the phrase not conclude with the words] \"So shall it be done to the man\" [which implies that only] actions done to the man [are critical, which excepts spitting].",
            "[If] a deaf-mute [<i>Yavam</i>] underwent <i>Chalitzah</i>, or if a deaf-mute [<i>Yevamah</i>] performed <i>Chalitzah</i>, or if a [<i>Yevamah</i>] performed <i>Chalitzah</i> for a minor, her <i>Chalitzah</i> is invalid. [If] a minor [<i>Yevama</i>] performed <i>Chalitzah</i>, she must perform <i>Chalitzah</i> [again] when she attains majority. And if she does not perform <i>Chalitzah</i> [again] her <i>Chalitzah</i> is invalid.",
            "[If] a [<i>Yevamah</i>] performed <i>Chalitzah</i> before [a court of] two, or [if] she performed <i>Chalitzah</i> before three but one of them is found to be a relative or ineligible [to serve as a judge] her <i>Chalitzah</i> is invalid. Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yochanan HaSandlar deem it valid. It happened once that a man underwent <i>Chalitzah</i> from a woman when they were alone in prison, and when the case came before Rabbi Rabbi Akiva, he deemed it valid.",
            "The <i>Mitzvah</i> of <i>Chalitzah</i> [is as follows]: He  [the <i>Yavam</i>] and his <i>Yevamah</i> come to a court and they advise him according to circumstances, for it is said, \"And the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him,\" (Devarim 25:8), and she says, \"My husband's brother refuses to raise up for his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform for me the duty of a husband's brother\" (Devarim 25:7).  And he says, \"I do not wish to take her\" (Devarim 25:8). And they would recite [these statements] in the Holy language [Hebrew]. \"Then shall the brother's wife approach him in the presence of the elders and loosen his shoe from his foot, and spit before him\" (Devarim 25:9) - spit that can be seen by the judges.  \"And she shall respond and say, 'So shall it be done to the man who will not build up his brother's house'\" (Devarim 25:9). This is as far as they read, but when Rabbi Hurcanus had [the text] read under the terebinth in the village of Etam, and had the passage completed, it became customary to read the whole passage.  \"And his name shall be called in Israel 'The house of him who had his shoe loosed'\", (Devarim 25:10).  It is a <i>Mitzvah</i> upon the judges but it is not a <i>Mitzvah</i>  upon the students.  Rabbi Yehudah says: It is a <i>Mitzvah</i>  upon all standing there to state, \"The man who had his shoe loosed! The man who had his shoe loosed! The man who had his shoe loosed!\""
