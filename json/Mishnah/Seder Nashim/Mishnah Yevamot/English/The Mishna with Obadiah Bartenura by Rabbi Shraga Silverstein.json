            "\tFifteen women exempt their tzaroth [\"rival wives\"] from chalitzah [release from yibum (levirate marriage)] and from yibum all the way down the line (i.e., tzarah of tzarah of tzarah, etc.). [If one of them were married to his brother, who (with her) had two wives, and he died without children, they are both exempt, it being written (Leviticus 18:8): \"And a woman together with her sister you shall not take to be rivals (litzror) to reveal her nakedness upon her.\" What is the intent of \"upon her\"? To teach that even his yevamah, of whom it is written (Deuteronomy 25:5): \"Her yavam shall come upon her\" — if she is \"a woman together with her sister,\" you shall not take her. And the same applies to all of the other arayoth where kareth obtains. And this tells me only of her. Whence is her tzarah derived (as likewise forbidden)? From \"litzror,\" which implies: Take neither her, nor her tzarah, nor the tzarah of her tzarah.] They (the fifteen women) are: His daughter [His daughter from his anussah (a woman that he had forced), as is the case with \"the daughter of his daughter\" and \"the daughter of his son.\" For his daughter from his wife is \"bath ishto.\" For since it is written (Leviticus 18:17): \"The nakedness of a woman (ishah) and her daughter you shall not reveal,\" it makes no difference whether it is his or another's daughter. But his daughter from his anussah is not derived from that verse, for \"ishah\" connotes marriage. It is derived, rather, from (Ibid. 10): \"The nakedness of the daughter of your son or the daughter of your daughter.\"], the daughter of his daughter, the daughter of his son, the daughter of his wife, the daughter of her son, the daughter of her daughter, his mother-in-law, the mother of his mother-in-law, the mother of his father-in-law [All of these are forbidden to him by reason of (Ibid. 17): \"The nakedness of a woman and her daughter you shall not reveal. The daughter of her son and the daughter of her daughter, etc.\", subsumed in which are his mother-in-law, the mother of his mother-in-law, and the mother of his father-in-law.], his sister from his mother [who married his brother from his father, who died, as is the case with his mother's sister. For yibum obtains only with one's brother from his father, this being derived by \"brotherhood\" identity from the sons of Yaakov (see Deuteronomy 25:5). Just as there, (they were all) brothers from the father, but not (necessarily) from the mother, here, too, (in the instance of yibum), it is not different.], his mother's sister, his wife's sister, the wife of his brother from his mother, [who, after her husband's death, married his brother from his father, to whom she is not kin. If he died without children, and she fell before him for yibum, she is forbidden to him by reason of her first having been the wife of his brother from his mother, who is forbidden to him perpetually, it being written (Leviticus 18:16): \"The nakedness of the wife of your brother,\" which is expounded \"your brother,\" whether from your father or from your mother.], and the wife of his brother who was not in his world [e.g., Reuven died without children and after his death, a brother, Levi, was born. Shimon took Reuven's wife in yibum. He had another wife and he died without children. Both of Shimon's wives fell before Levi for yibum. Both are exempt. The wife of Reuven who had been married to Shimon is forbidden to Levi on (liability of) kareth, Scripture having excluded her (from yibum), viz. (Deuteronomy 25:5): \"When brothers dwell together\" — when both of them had \"one dwelling\" (i.e., when they were concurrently alive) in the world. Therefore, when Reuven died, she was rendered perpetually forbidden to Levi (just as the wife of a brother who has children). And though now she falls to Levi through the marriage of Shimon, who was in his world, she is forbidden to him by reason of Reuven. And just as she is forbidden, so her tzarah is forbidden.], and his daughter-in-law. [His son died and she married his (her father-in-law's) brother. His daughter-in-law is forbidden to him perpetually, even after his son's death.] These (the aforementioned) exempt their tzaroth and the tzaroth of their tzaroth from chalitzah and from yibum all the way down the line. And all of them — if they died, or refused (his brother), or were divorced, or were found to be eiloniyoth (barren) — their tzaroth are permitted. [e.g., if his daughter died before his brother did, or if she refused him. And even though (normally), refusal (miun) obtains only with an orphaned minor, who was married by her mother and her brothers, it may also occur in her father's lifetime, as when her father married her to another and she was divorced when still a minor, in which instance her father no longer has jurisdiction over her. If she then married her father's brother while still a minor, she then can gain release through miun. (She is referred to later as \"an orphan in her father's lifetime.\") If she refused his brother, or were divorced by him, or were found to be an eilonith (in which instance \"her purchase was mistaken\" and it is as if she were never his brother's wife), her tzarah is taken in yibum.] [\"eilonith\" — from \"ayil,\" a ram. The characteristics of an eilonith are: an absence of breasts and of (pubertal) signs, a thick voice, like that of a man, and a lack of a \"belly slope,\" characteristic of women, i.e., her pudendum not projecting from her body, as that of other women.] And it cannot be said of his mother-in-law, the mother of his mother-in-law, and the mother of his father-in-law, that they were found to be eiloniyoth or that they refused. [For they already bore children to another before they married his brother. Therefore, they are not eiloniyoth. And miun, also, does not obtain with them, their being adults, and miun obtaining only with minors. As to our tanna's not including one's mother among those women who exempt their tzaroth from yibum, he holds with the ruling that one may not marry a woman whom his father had forced or seduced. But according to the ruling that one may marry her, and that this is the halachah, it is possible for one's mother to marry his brother from his father; and if his brother dies without children, his mother falls before him for yibum. So that there are found to be sixteen women who exempt their tzaroth, his mother being one of them. And this is the halachah.]",
            "\tHow do they exempt their tzaroth? If his daughter or one of the other of all these arayoth (forbidden relations) were married to his brother, who had another wife, and he died — just as his daughter is exempt (from yibum) [being forbidden to him, and there being no other brother but he], so her tzarah is exempt. If his daughter's tzarah went and married his second brother [in an instance where there is another brother, in which case both women are permitted to him and are not exempt, the mitzvah of yibum obtaining, in which instance he takes one of them in yibum and the other is exempt, it being written (Deuteronomy 25:9): \"the house of his brother\" — he builds one house, and not two], and he had another wife, and he died [without children, and they fell before him (for yibum)], just as the tzarah of his daughter is exempt [having been forbidden to him from the time she fell (for yibum) from his first brother], so the tzarah of her tzarah [the other wife of his second brother] is exempt [the first tzarah exempting her, the tzarah of an ervah (a forbidden relation) exempting her tzarah] — even if there were a hundred [brothers, and the tzarah of his daughter's tzarah went and was taken in yibum by his third brother, who had another wife, and he died without children; both are forbidden to him, and so, all the way down the line.] How, if they died, are their tzaroth permitted? If his daughter or one of the other of all of these arayoth were married to his brother, and he had another wife — if his daughter died or were divorced, and then his brother died, her tzarah is permitted [to be taken in yibum, for at the time of the yibum option, she was not her tzarah.] And if she [the ervah] could have refused [being a minor], and did not refuse [and his brother died], her tzarah performs chalitzah and is not taken in yibum. [Since she is considered married only by rabbinical ordinance and her yibum connection obtains only by rabbinical ordinance, she does not exempt her tzarah from chalitzah; but she is forbidden to be taken in yibum, because she seems like the tzarah of an ervah.]",
            "\tSix arayoth are more stringent than these [and what is their \"stringency\"?] — being married to others, [not being able to marry his brother from his father. And if their husbands die, who are not kin to this one, their tzaroth are permitted to marry him. For the tzarah of an ervah is forbidden to him only when she falls before him for yibum from his brother. And Rabbeinu Moshe ben Maimon explained: If they wed his brother illicitly, and he died without children, and they fell for yibum before him, their tzaroth are permitted. For these are not tzaroth of ervah, the marriage of his brother to these arayoth not being binding.] Their tzaroth are permitted: his mother [She may not marry his brother from his father, being forbidden to him by reason of \"the wife of his father\" (this according to the view that the anussah of his father is forbidden. I explained above that this is not the halachah; but that his mother exempts her tzarah, his mother being permitted to marry his brother from his father.)], the wife of his father, the sister of his father, his sister from his father, and the wife of his brother from his father [who had children. All are forbidden to his brother just as they are forbidden to him, and he never has any yibum linkage with these. If others married them, and they had other wives, and they died, their tzaroth are permitted to marry him. Likewise, if his brother married them illicitly and he died without children, their tzaroth are permitted.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai permit tzaroth to brothers. [They permit the tzarah of an ervah to be taken in yibum by one's brother, not expounding \"litzror\" (see above)], and Beth Hillel forbid them. If they [the tzaroth] received chalitzah [ from the brothers], Beth Shammai regard them [the tzaroth] as unfit for (marriage within) the priesthood, [their chalitzah being valid (and a chalutzah being forbidden to a Cohein)], and Beth Hillel regard them as fit, [their chalitzah having been unnecessary, and akin to chalitzah from a gentile.] If they were taken in yibum [by the brothers], Beth Shammai regard them as fit [for marriage to Cohanim if they are widowed from their husbands], and Beth Hillel as unfit, [living with those forbidden to them rendering them \"zonah,\" and thus forbidden to a Cohein]. Although these forbid, and these permit; these regard as unfit and these as fit, Beth Shammai did not keep from marrying women from Beth Hillel, and Beth Hillel did not keep from marrying women from Beth Shammai. [And even though the children of the tzaroth who were taken in yibum according to the ruling of Beth Shammai are mamzerim according to Beth Hillel, (the interdict against a brother's wife applying to them, the punishment for transgression being kareth, and the children born of a kareth union being mamzerim), still, Beth Hillel did not keep from marrying women from Beth Shammai; for they would apprise them which came from tzaroth and they would avoid them.] In all those instances where these ruled clean and the others unclean, they did not keep from observing ritual cleanliness among each other. [i.e., They would lend their vessels to each other. (The gemara asks why Beth Shammai's permitting the tzaroth to the brothers and Beth Hillel's forbidding them should not come under (Deuteronomy 14:1): \"Lo tithgodedu\" — you shall not form opposing factions (\"agudoth, agudoth\") — and it answers that \"lo tithgodedu\" would apply to one beth-din in one city, where half the judges ruled according to Beth Shammai, and half according to Beth Hillel — but not to two batei-din in one city, and certainly not to two batei-din in two cities.]"

            "\tHow does \"the wife of his brother who was not in his world\" [exempt her tzarah]? If there were two brothers and one of them died, and a brother was born to them, [to whom she was yibum-linked, but to whom (the third brother) she is forbidden by reason of \"the wife of his brother who was not in his world\"], and afterwards the second brother [who had a wife of his own] took his brother's wife in yibum, and he died [without children] — then the first woman [the wife of the first who had already fallen before him once (for yibum)] goes out (i.e., she is not taken in yibum) by reason of \"the wife of his brother who was not in his world\"; and the second (goes out) by virtue of being her tzarah. If he (the second) made a ma'amar in her (the first brother's wife) and he died [i.e., if he betrothed her with money. With a yevamah, money-betrothal is not bona fide betrothal, but obtains only by ordinance of the scribes. For a yevamah is not acquired by the yavam to be considered a married woman until he lives with her; and in this instance he had not lived with her before he died.], the second wife receives chalitzah [ and she is not exempt by reason of tzarath ervah, because she is not actually her tzarah], and she is not taken in yibum [because ma'amar acquires to a certain extent, and she is tzarath ervah to a certain extent. And wherever bona fide betrothal does not obtain, she receives chalitzah and is not taken yibum.]",
            "\tIf there were two brothers and one of them died, and the second took his brother's wife in yibum, and then a brother were born, and then he [the second brother] died — the first woman goes out by reason of \"the wife of his brother who was not in his world,\" and the second by reason of being her tzarah. If he made a ma'amar in her and he died, the second receives chalitzah, and she is not taken in yibum. R. Shimon says: He can take either one in  yibum or give chalitzah to either one. [And she exempts the other thereby. This does not relate to \"If he made a ma'amar in her,\" but to the first part, viz.: \"The first one goes out, etc.\" R. Shimon holds that since when he was born she had already been taken in yibum, and had never had a yibum linkage to him (the one who was born later) from the first brother, she is permitted to him. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]",
            "\tA general principle was stated in respect to a yevamah: If she is an issur ervah (interdicted as an ervah), she [her tzarah, and, it goes without saying, she herself], is subject to neither chalitzah nor yibum. [The same applies to an eilonith, it being written (Deuteronomy 25:6): \"And it shall be, the first-born that she bears\" — to exclude an eilonith. Likewise, the wife of a seris chammah (one born without testicles), and a hermaphrodite is subject to neither chalitzah not yibum, it being written (Ibid. 5): \"and he have no son\" — to exclude those who are incapable of begetting children. And the wife of a proselyte and of a freed bondsman is subject to neither chalitzah not yibum, there being no \"brotherhood\" to proselytes nor bondsmen. But a barren woman or an old woman receive chalitzah or are taken in yibum.] If she were interdicted as issur mitzvah or issur kedushah (see next Mishnah), she is subject to chalitzah, but not to yibum. If her sister [the sister of an ervah] were her yevamah [as when two sisters from his two brothers fell before him for yibum, one of them being forbidden to him as an ervah (e.g., his mother-in-law or his daughter-in-law)], she either receives chalitzah or is taken in yibum [For in such an instance, he is not in contravention of \"the sister of one linked to him (in yibum),\" an ervah not being linked to him].",
            "\tIssur mitzvah — shniyoth [secondary to arayoth] interdicted by the soferim. [They are called \"issur mitzvah\" because it is a mitzvah to hearken to the words of the sages. The shniyoth are: the mother of his mother (all the way down the line), the mother of his father's mother alone, the mother of his father (all the way down the line), the mother of his father's father, the wife of his father's father (all the way down the line), the wife of his father's mother (alone), the wife of his father's brother from the mother, the wife of his mother's brother, whether from the mother or from the father, the daughter-in-law of his son (all the way down the line), the daughter-in-law of his daughter, the daughter of the daughter of his son, the daughter of the daughter of his daughter, the daughter of the son of his son, the daughter of the son of his daughter, the daughter of the daughter of the son of his wife, the daughter of the daughter of the daughter of his wife, the mother of the mother of the father of his wife, the mother of the mother of the mother of his wife, the mother of the father of the mother of his wife, and the mother of the father of the father of his wife.] Issur kedushah — a widow to a high-priest [in an instance where his brother, a Cohein, died, and his wife fell before him (for yibum)], a divorced woman and a chalutzah to a plain Cohein [as when his dead brother had transgressed and married a divorced woman or a chalutzah. When he dies, she requires chalitzah, for betrothal \"takes\" in her (betrothal) \"taking\" in those interdicted by negative commandment (but not subject to kareth). But he does not take her in yibum, for she is forbidden to him. And simply to exempt her is impossible, the negative commandment not sufficing to exempt her, our deriving this (exemption) from the (instance of the) sister of one's wife, where kareth obtains], a mamzereth and a Nethinah to a Yisrael, and the daughter of a Yisrael to a Nathin and to a mamzer.",
            "\tIf one has a brother from any source [even a mamzer], he \"binds\" his brothers wife to yibum, and he is his brother for all purposes [to inherit him and to make himself unclean for him (at his death)] — except for one who has a brother from a bondswoman or from a gentile woman, [her child reverting to her, it being written in respect to a bondswoman (Exodus 21:4): \"The woman and her children shall belong to her master,\" and, in respect to a gentile woman, (Deuteronomy 7:4): \"For he will turn your son away from Me.\" Its not being written: \"For she will turn, etc.\" indicates the meaning to be (Ibid. 3): \"Your daughter do not give to his son,\" for the husband of your daughter will turn your son which your daughter will bear away from Me. But it does not refer to \"His daughter you shall not take for your son,\" for a son born of a gentile woman is not called your son, but her son.] If one has a son from any source, he (that son) exempts his father's wife from yibum, he is liable for striking and cursing him, and he is his son for all purposes — except for one who has a son from a bondswoman or from a gentile woman.",
            "\tIf a man betrothed one of two sisters and did not know which one, [so that both are forbidden to him, each one possibly being the sister of the woman he married], he gives a get to each. If he died and had another brother, he gives chalitzah to both [for he does not know which is his yevamah. And he cannot give chalitzah to one and take the other in yibum, by reason of \"the sister of his chalutzah.\" (And she is forbidden to him in her sister's lifetime by rabbinical ordinance.) Nor can he take one in yibum first, for she might not be his yevamah, in which instance he would be violating the sister of one \"linked\" to him, who is like his wife. If he had two brothers, one gives chalitzah [to one first], and the second, [if he wishes,] takes [the other] in yibum. [For if she (the other) is his yevamah, all well and good; and if she is the yevamah's sister, he does not violate \"the sister of his linked one,\" for the chalitzah of the other brother had dissolved the linkage.] If the brothers were beforehand and married them [before taking counsel with beth-din], they are not taken from them [for each one can say: \"I married correctly.\" And even if it were otherwise — that the first who wed for yibum really took the sister of his linked one — it was at that time that he transgressed, and when his brother came and took the other, the true yevamah, in yibum, the linkage to the other was retroactively dissolved.]",
            "\tIf two [who were not brothers] betrothed two sisters, each not knowing which he betrothed, each gives two gittin. If they died, and each had a brother, each gives chalitzah to both, [each being forbidden to perform yibum because of the possibility of \"the sister of his linked one\"]. If one had one brother and the other two, the one brother gives chalitzah to both, [yibum being impossible both before the chalitzah of the second woman, by reason of \"the sister of his linked one,\" and after, by reason of \"the sister of his chalutzah.\" Therefore, since yibum is forbidden, he first gives chalitzah to both, to free the one who is his yevamah to others]; and the two brothers — one gives chalitzah [to dissolve the linkage from his brother, if this is his yevamah], and the second takes (the other) in yibum. [The sister is permitted to the second in any case. If she is his yevamah, all well and good; and if she is the sister of his yevamah, the linkage of the latter was dissolved by his brother's chalitzah.] If they were beforehand and married them, they are not taken from them. If each had two brothers, the brother of one gives chalitzah to one, and the brother of the other gives chalitzah to the other. The latter brother takes the chalutzah of the former in yibum, and the former brother takes the chalutzah of the latter in yibum. [For, in any case, if the one he takes is his yevamah, he has taken her correctly, his brother having given chalitzah not to her, but to her sister, who was not his yevamah, so that the chalitzah is of no import. And if the one he takes is not his yevamah, he has properly wed an unattached woman. For \"the sister of his linked one\" does not obtain here, his brother having given chalitzah to her sister, his yevamah, so that the linkage is dissolved.] If two [brothers of (one of the deceased)] were beforehand, and gave chalitzah [to both of them, (each) not knowing which was his yevamah], the two [other brothers] may not take them [respectively] in yibum [for it may be that the first would be taking the sister of his linked one], but one gives chalitzah [first to one of them], and the other takes [the second] in yibum. [For, in either case, if she is his yevamah, all well and good; and if not, he will not have violated \"the sister of his linked one,\" his brother having given chalitzah to his yevamah. And she (the latter) will not be considered \"a yevamah to the marketplace,\" having received chalitzah from her husband's brother.] And if they [the two other brothers] were beforehand, and married them [after the chalitzah of the first two, not having consulted beth-din], they are not taken from them [as explained before. For there obtains only the possibility of \"the sister of his linked one\" in the marriage of the first. And it may be that he had actually, and properly, married his yevamah, so that the other brother, too, would properly have married an unattached woman. And even if the opposite were the case, and the first had violated \"the sister of his linked one,\" when the second came and took the other in yibum, her linkage would have been (retroactively) dissolved and his (the first brother's) wife would be permitted to him, though he had transgressed in taking her.]",

And if the younger were beforehand (to take her in yibum), he acquires her. If one were suspected of (relations with) a bondswoman, and she were freed, or with a gentile woman, and she became a proselyte, he may not marry her. If he did, she is not taken from him. If one were suspected of (relations with) a married woman, and they (beth-din) took her from him [her husband, because of this one, who caused her to be forbidden to him, and this one went and married her], even though he married her, he must send her away. [For the Torah forbids her also to him, just as she is forbidden to her husband, it being expounded (Numbers 5:13 and 14): \"she be unclean,\" twice — once, vis-à-vis the husband; once, vis-à-vis the adulterer. And this applies only to one who is suspected of adultery; but if one is suspected of relations with an unmarried woman, it would seem that it is a mitzvah for him to marry her, as we find in respect to one who forces a virgin (Deuteronomy 22:29): \"And to him shall she be as a wife.\"]",

[For we have only his testimony to rely upon (and he may be lying in order to marry her)]. If he says: \"He died\" or \"I killed him\" or \"We killed him,\" he may not marry his wife. [For since she weds on the basis of his testimony, there may be talk that he \"cast his eyes upon her\" and testified falsely to be able to wed her. But she may marry another; for a woman may be married on the basis of the testimony of one witness.] R. Yehudah says: If he says: \"I killed him,\" his wife may not marry [on the basis of his testimony, even to another. For he is an evil-doer (by his own admission); and the Torah forbids the testimony of an evil-doer. But the halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah, it being ruled that a man does not render himself an evil-doer, being \"solicitous\" of himself. We believe him, then, as to the other's having been killed; but not as to his having killed him. So that even if he says: \"I killed him,\" his wife may marry.] [The gemara explains this (\"We killed him\") to mean: \"I was with his killers, but I did not kill him.\"]",

If she performed miun or chalitzah before him, he may marry her because he is a beth-din. [That is, this sage did not preside over miun or chalitzah by himself, two or three being required for this, so that he is not suspect. But one expert suffices for the absolution of vows.] And all of them [the sage, and one who brought a get, and one who testified to enable a woman to marry, concerning whom we learned that they may not marry her], if they had wives [at the time] and they died, they are [thereafter] permitted to marry them, [there being no \"suspicion\" in such an instance]. And all [these women] who were married to others [when the sage forbade her, or when the witness testified that her husband had died], and they were divorced or widowed [ from their second husbands], they are permitted to marry them [the sage or the one who brought the get]. And they are all permitted to the sons or the brothers [of those who permitted them, being forbidden only to the permitters themselves; for one does not sin on behalf of his son or his brother. And all of these concerning whom it is stated \"He may not marry her\" — if he did marry her, he need not send her away — with the exception of one who is suspected of adultery, in which instance, if beth-din took her from her husband on the basis of testimony and clear evidence, even if he did marry her, he must send her away. And if there were witnesses only to something suggestive, such as the man leaving and the woman girt in a sinar (a kind of breech-cloth) or the man leaving and the woman rising from her bed, and the like — if he married her, he need not send her away. And if after such witnesses came, the report were broadcast and did not cease after a day and a half — if he married her, he must send her away (unless he had children from her, in which instance he does not send her away, so that suspicion not be cast upon his children).]"

R. Eliezer says in the name of Beth Shammai: They may keep them, and Beth Hillel say: They must send them away. [The gemara reverses this, viz.: Beth Shammai say: They must send them away, and Beth Hillel say: They may keep them. For in all places, Beth Shammai's is the stringent ruling, and Beth Hillel's the lenient, except for those noted instances where the opposite is the case. And in general we say: \"Beth Shammai in the place of Beth Hillel is not a Mishnah.\" That is, wherever we find in the Mishnah that Beth Shammai's is the lenient ruling (where it is wont to be Beth Hillel's, so that Beth Shammai stands in the place of Beth Hillel), we assume it to be not a (bona fide) Mishnah, but mistaken, and we reverse it (unless it be one of the noted Mishnayoth where Beth Shammai takes the lenient view and Beth Hillel the stringent one.

If (one of them were forbidden as an) issur mitzvah or an issur kedushah [who, by Torah ordinance, falls before him for yibum, for which reason her sister is forbidden to him as \"the sister of his linked one\"], they receive chalitzah and are not taken in yibum.",

The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.] If one of them were forbidden to him as an issur ervah, he is forbidden to take her and permitted to take her sister.

[For ma'amar is not sufficient to give her the status of a married woman, and the other is forbidden by reason of \"the sister of his linked one.\" A get is necessary because of the ma'amar, which is partial betrothal, and betrothal is not dissolved without a get. And she also requires chalitzah, for since the ma'amar is not bona fide betrothal, she is still linked to him (for yibum) and requires chalitzah to dissolve that linkage; so that first he gives her a get, and then chalitzah.

As to her tzarah, the stranger, the ruling for her is not given. It stands to reason that she is given chalitzah and not taken in yibum.] If there were three brothers, two of them married to two sisters, and one of them married to a stranger — if one of the sisters' husbands divorced his wife, and the one married to the stranger died, and the one who had divorced his wife died took the stranger (in yibum) and he died — of such an instance it was stated: \"And all, if they died or if they were divorced, their tzaroth are permitted.\"",

Shimon says: He may take either one in yibum [He holds that we are in doubt as to whether ma'amar acquires completely or does not acquire at all. Therefore, he can take either one in yibum.

Shimon.

For a condition of the kethubah is likened to the kethubah itself.], and she does not have sustenance [It goes without saying that he does not have to feed her while she is still with him, for he is obliged to send her away.

For the lender claims what he lent her and she claims it of her husband. For it is only when one fed her not by way of loan that we say in Kethuvoth that the halachah is according to Chanan, who said that if one went abroad and another fed his wife, he (the latter) has placed his money \"on a deer's horn.\" For since he fed her for the sake of her husband, and he lent her nothing, from whom can he claim payment? She did not borrow anything, and her husband did not ask him to feed her. Therefore, he has performed a mitzvah (but he can make no claim). If he lent her, and she is kasher, her husband must repay him, but if she is one of the shniyoth, he is not obliged to pay.], and she does not receive belaoth [If the husband used her nichsei melog until they were \"worn out\" (balu), he need not reimburse her. For we might think that since she has no kethubah, if the husband ate her nichsei melog, he must reimburse her for what was \"worn away\"; we are, therefore, apprised that the rabbis penalized her, that her husband not pay belaoth, but whatever she finds remaining (of the nichsei melog) she takes], and the child (of the union) is kasher, and we force him to send her away. A widow to a high-priest, a divorcée and a chalutzah to a regular priest, a mamzereth and a Nethinah to an Israelite, the daughter of an Israelite to a Nathin or to a mamzer have a kethubah.

In the chapter \"These receive stripes,\" it is shown that a chalutzah to a high-priest is interdicted by the Torah.

If they distribute ma'aser to a woman on the threshing floor, they might come to distribute it to the daughter of an Israelite after she has been divorced from the Levite; for not all  know that she had been receiving on the strength of her husband. For this reason R. Meir decreed that a woman not take a share on the threshing floor, even the daughter of a Cohein and the daughter of a Levite. As to its being stated: \"The daughter of a Levite betrothed to a Cohein… may eat neither terumah nor ma'aser,\" the same is true even if she were married. It is because of the first part of the Mishnah, viz.: \"The daughter of an Israelite betrothed to a Cohein, etc.\" (in which instance it is only if she were betrothed that she does not eat; for if she were married, she would eat) that here, too, at the end of the Mishnah, \"The daughter of a Levite betrothed to a Cohein\" is stated.]",

If he dies, and she had a child from him, she eats neither terumah nor ma'aser. If her child from the Israelite died, she eats ma'aser. If her child from the Levite died, she may eat terumah.

[(\"If there were peace between him and her\":) For if there were strife between him and her, (we entertain the apprehension that) perhaps she is motivated by hatred to forbid herself to him. (\"and peace in the world\":) For if it were a time of danger, perhaps, when she saw that he was long in returning, she assumed that he had certainly been killed by bandits. Or else, she had seen him struck down in battle and assumed that he had certainly been killed. But, in peace-time, if she had not seen him killed, she would certainly apprehend the obloquy of his returning after she had remarried (so that she would not remarry unless she were certain that he were dead.)] If there were peace between him and her, and war in the world, or strife between him and her and peace in the world, and she came and said: My husband died, she is not believed. R. Yehudah says: She is never believed unless she came crying with her clothes rent.

Beth Hillel answered: We have found that her brothers do not enter the inheritance [of her husband] by her testimony, [it being written (Deuteronomy 19:15): \"By word of two witnesses, etc.\", but vis-à-vis her marrying, the rabbis were lenient, so that she not remain an agunah.] Beth Shammai rejoined: But should we not learn (the ruling) from the scroll of her kethubah, [i.e., from the formula of the kethubah deed], where he writes to her: \"If you marry another, take what is written (over) to you,\" [and she did remarry, wherefore she should take her kethubah!] — whereupon Beth Hillel retracted (their ruling) to rule according to Beth Shammai.",

R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua say: We do not marry a woman on the testimony of one witness. R. Akiva says: Not on the testimony of a woman, of a bondsman, or of a bondswoman, or of kin.

When they returned, they asked the hostess: \"Where is our friend?\" She answered: \"He died and I buried him\" — and they married his wife.
