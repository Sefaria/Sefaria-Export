            "The Torah law obligating a man whose brother died without children [<i>yavam</i>] to marry his deceased brother’s widow [<i>yevama</i>] or to free her from her levirate bonds through the act of <i>ḥalitza</i> applies only when it is permitted for the widow to marry her surviving brother-in-law. However, in cases where the <i>yevama</i> is forbidden to her <i>yavam</i> due to her status as a close family relative, the mitzva of levirate marriage is not applicable, and she is exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>.<br>The Sages further taught that the exemption of a <i>yevama</i> from levirate marriage also exempts her rival wife. In other words, if the deceased brother had two wives, each a so-called rival of the other, and only one wife is a relative of the surviving brother, then the rival wife is also exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>. Moreover, if that same rival wife entered into levirate marriage with a different brother of the deceased, one to whom she is not forbidden, then were this third brother also to die childless, so that the obligation of levirate marriage would again be incurred by the second brother, not only is the forbidden rival wife exempt from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, her new rival wives from her second marriage are also exempt.<br>That is to say, any other wife of the third brother is exempt from the mitzva of levirate marriage, as she is the rival wife of that first rival wife, who was exempted from levirate marriage following her first husband’s death due the exemption of her original rival wife. The same principle applies if that second rival wife subsequently enters into levirate marriage with another permitted brother, and so on. In summary, every widow who is exempt from marrying her brother-in-law due to her status as rival wife of a forbidden relative is treated as a forbidden relative herself and is therefore exempt from both <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage and causes exemption for future rival wives as well.<br><br>The mishna describes various cases that invoke the principles above. <b>Fifteen</b> categories of <b>women</b> constitute familial relations that are forbidden as incestuous, and consequently, these women <b>exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives from <i>ḥalitza</i> and from levirate marriage forever,</b> i.e., they also exempt rival wives of rival wives of rival wives, and so on. <b>And these</b> women <b>are: The daughter</b> of the <i>yavam</i>, i.e., the deceased brother had married a daughter of his brother, which means that when he died childless, his brother’s own daughter came before her father for levirate marriage, and therefore she is exempt. <b>And</b> the same applies if the deceased brother’s widow is <b>the daughter of</b> the <b>daughter of</b> the <i>yavam</i>, <b>or</b> if she is <b>the daughter of his son,</b> or <b>the daughter of</b> his <b>wife.</b> <b>And</b> similarly, if the <i>yevama</i> is <b>the daughter of</b> the <b>son</b> of the wife of her <i>yavam</i> <b>or the daughter of</b> his wife’s <b>daughter, or</b> if she is the <b>mother-in-law</b> of her <i>yavam</i>, <b>or his mother-in-law’s mother, or his father-in-law’s mother,</b> then she is exempt from <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage. The mishna continues its list of close relatives. If the <i>yevama</i> is the <b>maternal</b> half <b>sister</b> of the <i>yavam</i>, <b>or</b> if she is the <b>sister of his mother, or his wife’s sister,</b> then she is exempt from both <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage <b>Or</b> if she was <b>the wife of his maternal</b> half <b>brother,</b> and after this brother died or divorced his wife, she married another of his father’s brothers, who was not her relative, and this brother died, she is exempt. In this case, the obligation to enter into levirate marriage should be incurred by the surviving brother, but since she was previously the wife of his maternal brother, she is exempt. <b>And</b> the same applies to the <b>wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist,</b> i.e., the wife of a man who died before his brother was born. As will be explained, the obligation of levirate marriage does not apply to the <i>yavam</i> in this case. Since levirate marriage does not apply to him, the <i>yevama</i> remains forbidden to him as his brother’s wife. <b>And</b> the last case is if one’s <i>yevama</i> had previously been <b>his daughter-in-law,</b> and after his son had died one’s brother married her, before he too passed away. <b>These</b> fifteen women <b>exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives from <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage forever.</b> § <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of these</b> women listed as prohibited relations, these <i>halakhot</i> apply only if they were married to the deceased brother until the time of his death. However, this is not the case <b>if they died</b> during the deceased brother’s lifetime, <b>or</b> if <b>they refused</b> their husbands when they were minors. This refusal is referring to the decree of the Sages that a girl under the age of twelve whose father is no longer alive may be married off by her mother or brothers. However, this marriage is not final, as she can terminate it by performing an act of refusal, i.e., by declaring, while still a minor, that she does not desire this marriage. In this case, the marriage is annulled retroactively and she is considered as though she were never married at all. <b>Or</b> if those women <b>were divorced</b> by their husband, the deceased brother, <b>or were found to be a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>aylonit</i>],</b> i.e., a woman who is so underdeveloped that she is not considered a woman in the full sense, these <i>halakhot</i> do not apply. Her marriage is considered a mistaken marriage and is null and void. In all these cases <b>their rival wives are permitted,</b> as the exemption for rival wives of forbidden relatives applies only when the forbidden relative was the brother’s wife at the time of his death, when the <i>halakhot</i> of levirate marriage came into effect. § <b>And</b> the mishna comments that the language of this principle is imprecise, as <b>you cannot say with regard to his mother-in-law and with regard to his mother-in-law’s mother and with regard to his father-in-law’s mother that they were found to be an <i>aylonit</i>,</b> as an <i>aylonit</i> is sterile and therefore cannot become a mother or a mother-in-law. <b>Nor</b> is the mishna precise when it states: <b>Or refused,</b> as refusal applies only to minors, who cannot give birth.",
            "The mishna explains: <b>How do</b> these women <b>exempt their rival wives?</b> If, for example, <b>his daughter or any one of those</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden was married to his brother and</b> this brother <b>had another wife, and</b> the brother <b>died,</b> then <b>just as his daughter is exempt</b> from levirate marriage, <b>so too her rival wife is exempt.</b> If <b>his daughter’s rival wife</b> subsequently <b>went and married his second brother,</b> to whom she is permitted, <b>and he had another wife, and he died</b> childless as well, which means that his wife comes before the first <i>yavam</i>, the daughter’s father, for levirate marriage, then <b>just as his daughter’s rival wife is exempt, so too the rival wife of her rival wife is exempt.</b> The mishna adds: <b>Even if they are one hundred</b> brothers, the same logic applies. If a woman is exempt from levirate marriage because she is the rival wife of a forbidden relative or the rival wife of a rival wife of this kind, and she herself has an additional rival wife, this rival wife is also exempt and in turn exempts her own rival wives from levirate marriage. <b>How so?</b> What are the cases in which <b>if they died their rival wives are permitted?</b> If, for example, <b>one’s daughter or any one of those</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden was married to his brother, and</b> this brother <b>had another wife,</b> and then <b>his daughter died or was divorced and afterward his brother died, her rival wife is permitted</b> to him. § The mishna states another principle: <b>And</b> if <b>any</b> of these forbidden relatives was a minor <b>who could refuse</b> her husband, then even if <b>she did not refuse, her rival wife performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and does not enter into levirate marriage.</b> The rival wife may not enter into levirate marriage, as she is the rival wife of a forbidden relative. However, she is not entirely exempt from levirate marriage and must be released by <i>ḥalitza</i> because the marriage of the forbidden relative was not a fully valid marriage, and therefore, by Torah law, the other woman is not considered a rival wife of a forbidden relative.",
            "<b>Six</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden</b> who were not enumerated in the first mishna <b>are</b> forbidden by prohibitions that are <b>more severe than those</b> listed in that mishna <b>because they may be married</b> only <b>to others</b> and may never be married to any of the brothers, due to the closeness of their relationship. However, this stringency entails a corresponding leniency: Since the <i>halakha</i> of levirate marriage is entirely inapplicable in these cases, <b>their rival wives are permitted.</b> The rival wife of a forbidden relative is forbidden herself only if the mitzva of levirate marriage is applicable, but where it is not in effect she is permitted. The six women with whom relations are forbidden are as follows: <b>His mother, and his father’s wife, and his father’s sister, and his paternal</b> half <b>sister, and the wife of his father’s brother, and the wife of his paternal</b> half <b>brother.</b> Each of these women with whom relations are forbidden is forbidden equally to all of the brothers, and the mitzva of levirate marriage is inapplicable. Therefore, her rival wife is permitted.",
            "Up to this point, the discussions were based on the assumption that not only may a forbidden relative not enter into levirate marriage, but her rival wife is also exempt. However, this issue is subject to a long-standing dispute. <b>Beit Shammai permit the rival wives to the brothers,</b> as they did not accept the interpretation of the verses that indicates that rival wives are prohibited. <b>And Beit Hillel forbid</b> them. The previous <i>mishnayot</i> are in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel. If any of the rival wives of the brother <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, Beit Shammai disqualify</b> her <b>from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood,</b> as in their opinion these rival wives were fit for levirate marriage, which means that the <i>ḥalitza</i> was fully valid. Consequently, they are disqualified from marrying a priest, like all other women who perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel deem</b> them <b>fit,</b> as they maintain that no legal act of <i>ḥalitza</i> was performed here at all. If <b>they entered into levirate marriage, Beit Shammai deem</b> them <b>fit</b> for the priesthood, as in their opinion, this is a fully legal levirate marriage. <b>And Beit Hillel disqualify them,</b> because they engaged in licentious sexual relations as the rival wives of a forbidden relative. § The mishna comments: <b>Although</b> Beit Hillel <b>prohibit</b> the rival wives to the brothers <b>and</b> Beit Shammai <b>permit</b> them, and although <b>these disqualify</b> these women <b>and those deem</b> them <b>fit, Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel</b> refrain from marrying women <b>from Beit Shammai.</b> Furthermore, with regard to <b>all of the</b> disputes concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual purity and impurity, where these</b> rule that an article is <b>ritually pure and those</b> rule it <b>ritually impure, they did not refrain from handling ritually pure</b> objects <b>each with the other,</b> as Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel frequently used each other’s vessels."

            "Each of the women enumerated in the first chapter causes exemption from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i> for her rival wives. This is due to the close family relationship she has with her brother-in-law, making her forbidden to him. The single exception is the case explained in this mishna. <b>What</b> is the case of <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist?</b> For example: If there were <b>two brothers, and one of them died</b> childless, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>a brother of theirs was born, after which the second brother,</b> the elder, <b>took his</b> deceased <b>brother’s wife in levirate marriage, and</b> then <b>died</b> as well. Consequently, two women require levirate marriage: The widow of the first brother who had been taken in levirate marriage by the second brother, and the widow of the second brother, the first widow’s rival wife. <b>The first</b> widow, who had been the wife of the first brother to die, <b>goes out</b> without any obligation to be taken in levirate marriage by the youngest brother who was born later, <b>since</b> she is <b>the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist.</b> The first deceased brother never lived at the same time as the newly born brother. <b>The second</b> widow, who had been married to the second brother, is exempt <b>due to her rival wife.</b> The mishna discusses an additional situation: If the second brother had <b>performed</b> only <b>levirate betrothal with her,</b> meaning that he had not yet consummated the marriage, <b>and</b> then <b>died,</b> both the wife betrothed by a levirate betrothal to the second brother and the wife of the second brother fall before the youngest brother born after the death of the first brother. In that case, the first wife certainly goes out and is exempt from both <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage, since she is to him the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. <b>The second,</b> however, was never effectively the rival wife of the first brother’s wife, as the first brother’s wife had only been betrothed by levirate betrothal and was not fully married to the second brother. Therefore, <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage.</b>",
            "If there were <b>two brothers, and one died, and the second entered into levirate marriage with his brother’s wife</b> while he was already married to another woman, <b>and subsequently</b> a third <b>brother was born to them, and</b> the second brother then <b>died,</b> whereby both of his wives happened before the third brother for levirate marriage, then <b>the first woman,</b> who was the wife of the first brother, <b>is exempt due to</b> the fact that she is <b>the wife of a brother with whom</b> the third brother <b>did not coexist, and the second</b> woman, who was the first wife of the second brother, is exempt <b>due to her rival wife.</b> If the second brother had <b>performed</b> only <b>levirate betrothal with her and</b> then <b>died</b> before fully marrying her, <b>the second</b> woman <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage,</b> as the levirate betrothal is not considered a sufficiently valid marriage so as to render her the rival wife of a relation forbidden to the third brother. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> with regard to the first clause of the mishna: The third brother either <b>enters into levirate marriage with whichever one he wishes, or he performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with whichever one he wishes.</b> Since he was born after his second brother had already entered into levirate marriage with the first brother’s widow, she is considered the wife of a brother with whom he did coexist, not the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist. Therefore, he may enter into levirate marriage with her.",
            "The Sages <b>stated a principle about a <i>yevama</i>: Whoever is</b> forbidden <b>by a prohibition of forbidden relations</b> to her <i>yavam</i> <b>neither performs <i>ḥalitza</i> nor enters into levirate marriage</b> and is completely exempt. If she is forbidden by <b>a prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva</b> or by <b>a prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity,</b> as will be explained later, then since in these cases the obligation of levirate marriage is not fundamentally nullified <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> in order to become free of the levirate bond, <b>and</b> due to her prohibition <b>she does not enter into levirate marriage.</b> The Sages stated another principle: If two sisters who had been married to two brothers who subsequently died happened before the third brother for levirate marriage, and one of those sisters is a close relation to this third brother and is therefore forbidden to him, she is exempt from levirate marriage. But the other, <b>her sister who is her <i>yevama</i>,</b> i.e., her sister-in-law, <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b> In this case, they are not ruled to be two sisters who happened before him simultaneously for levirate marriage, since one of them is prohibited to him as a forbidden relation, and therefore she never actually happened before him at all.",
            "The mishna explains: <b>A prohibition</b> resulting from <b>a mitzva</b> is referring to <b>secondary</b> forbidden <b>relationships,</b> which are prohibited <b>by rabbinic law.</b> The Sages prohibited marriage to certain women who were not forbidden by the Torah but were nevertheless deemed forbidden incestuous relations. <b>A prohibition</b> stemming from <b>sanctity</b> is referring to marriage of <b>a widow to a High Priest, a divorcée or a woman who has performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>] to a common priest, a daughter born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzeret</i>]</b> or a <b>Gibeonite woman to an Israelite, and</b> also <b>an Israelite woman to a Gibeonite or</b> to <b>a son born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzer</i>].</b>",
            "In the case of <b>anyone who has a brother of any kind,</b> that brother <b>creates a levirate bond</b> causing his <b><i>yevama</i> to</b> be required to <b>perform levirate marriage</b> if the first brother dies childless. <b>And he is his brother in all respects, except for one who has a brother</b> born <b>from</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant or from a gentile woman,</b> as these do not have the legal status of brothers. Similarly, in the case of <b>anyone who has a child of any kind,</b> that child <b>exempts his father’s wife from levirate marriage,</b> since his father did not die childless. <b>And</b> that child <b>is liable</b> to receive capital punishment <b>if he strikes</b> his father <b>or curses him. And he is his child in all respects, except for whoever has a child</b> born <b>from</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant or from a gentile woman,</b> as these do not have the halakhic status of children.",
            "In the case of <b>one who betrothed one of two sisters and does not know which of them he betrothed,</b> so that both are forbidden to him, he <b>gives a bill of divorce to this one and a bill of divorce to that one</b> due to the uncertainty. If the man who had betrothed one of these women <b>died</b> before he could give a bill of divorce, <b>and he had one brother,</b> that brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them,</b> but he may not take either in levirate marriage. This is because he does not know which woman is his <i>yevama</i> and which is forbidden to him as the sister of a woman with whom he has a levirate bond. If the man who betrothed one of these women <b>had two</b> brothers, <b>one</b> of them <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with one of the sisters, but he may not enter into levirate marriage with her due to the possibility that she is the sister of a woman with whom he has a levirate bond. <b>And one takes</b> the other <b>in levirate marriage</b> if he so desires. If the two brothers <b>married</b> the two sisters <b>before</b> consulting the court, the court does not <b>remove them</b> from their marriage and they are permitted to remain married. The couple who performed levirate marriage second was even permitted to do so, since there was no longer any doubt about the levirate bond.",
            "Furthermore, in the case of <b>two</b> unrelated men <b>who betrothed two sisters:</b> If <b>this one does not know which</b> sister <b>he betrothed and that one does not know which</b> sister <b>he betrothed, this one gives two bills of divorce,</b> one to each of the women, <b>and that one gives two bills of divorce.</b> If the two men <b>died</b> before they divorced, and <b>this one had a brother and that one had a brother,</b> then <b>this</b> brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them, and that</b> brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them.</b> If <b>this one had one</b> brother <b>and that one had two</b> brothers, <b>the single</b> brother <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both of them, and</b> of <b>the two</b> brothers, <b>one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and one performs levirate marriage</b> if he so desires. If <b>they married</b> the sisters <b>before</b> consulting the court, the court <b>does not remove them</b> from the marriage and they are not told to divorce them. If <b>this one had two</b> brothers <b>and that one had two</b> brothers, <b>the brother of this one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with one</b> sister, <b>and the brother of that one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with one</b> sister. <b>The brother of this</b> one who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>may take the woman who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>] of that</b> other’s brother <b>in levirate marriage, and the brother of that</b> second one who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>may take the <i>ḥalutza</i> of that</b> other’s brother <b>in levirate marriage.</b> If the two brothers <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with both wives <b>before</b> consulting the court, <b>the</b> two brothers of the second man <b>may not take</b> sisters <b>in levirate marriage</b> lest one marry the sister of a woman who with whom he had a levirate bond. <b>Rather, one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and one performs levirate marriage</b> if he so desires. If <b>they married</b> their wives <b>before</b> consulting the court, the court <b>does not remove them</b> from the marriage.",
            "<b>It is a mitzva for the eldest to consummate the levirate marriage,</b> i.e., the eldest takes precedence over the other brothers, though they too are obligated. <b>But if the younger</b> brother consummated the levirate marriage <b>first, he acquires</b> the <i>yevama</i> as his wife. <b>One suspected</b> by others of engaging in sexual relations <b>with a</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant and she was</b> later <b>set free, or</b> one suspected of relations <b>with a gentile woman and she</b> subsequently <b>converted, may not marry</b> that woman, since this will strengthen the suspicions against him. <b>But if he did marry her, they,</b> the judges of the court, <b>do not remove</b> her <b>from him,</b> i.e., they do not require him to divorce her. With regard to <b>one who is suspected of</b> illicit relations with <b>a married woman and they,</b> the judges of the court, <b>removed her from</b> her husband, i.e., required them to divorce due to this, <b>even if</b> the man suspected of the illicit relations subsequently <b>married</b> her, <b>he must divorce</b> her.",
            "An agent <b>who brought a bill of divorce from a country overseas and said: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence,</b> as required in order to establish the bill of divorce as valid, <b>may not marry</b> the <b>wife,</b> i.e., the divorcée. Since the validity of the bill of divorce is based upon his testimony, marrying the divorcée creates the impression that he had an ulterior motive for his testimony. Similarly, a witness who testified that a certain man <b>died,</b> or testified: <b>I killed him,</b> or: <b>We killed him, may not marry</b> that man’s <b>wife. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he testified: <b>I killed him, his wife may not be married</b> at all based on that evidence, as his testimony is unreliable, but if he said: <b>We killed him, his wife may be married</b> to anyone other than those witnesses.",
            "A <b>Sage who</b> refused to release a woman from a vow that <b>rendered the wife forbidden to her husband by</b> that <b>vow,</b> resulting in her being divorced from her husband, <b>may not marry her,</b> so as to avoid suspicion that he rendered her forbidden to her husband in order to marry her himself. However, a judge before whom a woman <b>performed refusal</b> when she was a minor, declaring that she did not desire the husband chosen for her by her family, <b>or before whom</b> she <b>performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, may marry her because</b> he was only one member of <b>the court,</b> thereby alleviating suspicion. <b>And</b> for <b>all of these</b> who were involved in permitting the wife to remarry, i.e., the judge, the agent who brought a bill of divorce, and the one who testified for a woman that her husband died, if <b>they had wives</b> at the time of the ruling or the testimony <b>and</b> their wives <b>died</b> thereafter, then those women they had set free <b>are permitted to be married to them.</b> There is no concern that while their wives were still alive these individuals set their eyes upon another woman. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of these</b> women who were prohibited from marrying a certain man due to some suspicion, if <b>they were</b> subsequently <b>married to others and</b> then <b>were divorced or widowed</b> from the second husband, <b>they are permitted to be married to them,</b> i.e., to the judge, messenger, or witness who permitted her to remarry. <b>And all of these</b> women who were prohibited from marrying due to some suspicion <b>are permitted to the sons or to the brothers</b> of those who set them free."

The same is true in the case of <b>a priest disqualified due to flawed lineage</b> [<b><i>ḥalal</i></b>], e.g., the son of a priest and a divorcée, <b>who married</b> a woman <b>fit</b> to marry a priest, <b>and he has a brother</b> who <b>is</b> a priest <b>fit</b> for service. That woman was permitted to marry the <i>ḥalal</i> but is forbidden to his brother. Having engaged in intercourse with the <i>ḥalal</i>, she is rendered a <i>ḥalala</i>, a woman disqualified from marrying a priest.

            "<b>And these</b> are cases of women who <b>are permitted to their <i>yevamin</i> and forbidden to their husbands:</b> For example, there is the case of <b>a High Priest who betrothed a widow, and he has a brother</b> who <b>is a common priest,</b> whom she is permitted to marry. This is true only if the High Priest merely betrothed her. However, if he consummated the marriage, he rendered her a <i>ḥalala</i> forbidden to all priests, including her <i>yavam</i>.

Rabbi Elazar says: The first</b> husband <b>is entitled to her found</b> articles, <b>to her earnings, and to the nullification of her vows.</b> Since her second marriage was an error, the first husband does not forfeit his rights. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> an even more far-reaching ruling: <b>Her sexual relations or her <i>ḥalitza</i> with the brothers of the first</b> husband <b>exempts her rival wife,</b> as it is considered a proper levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>, and certainly she does not require <i>ḥalitza</i> from the brother of the second husband. <b>And</b> if she returns to her first husband, <b>the child from him is not a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> All these <i>halakhot</i> refer to a situation when she married with the permission of the court, after hearing that her husband had died. <b>But if she married without</b> the <b>consent</b> of the court, basing herself entirely on the testimony she heard, and her husband returned, it is <b>permitted</b> for her <b>to return to</b> her first husband.

In this regard, the <b>power of the court is greater, as she is exempt from</b> bringing <b>an offering.</b> If the <b>court instructed her to marry</b> on the basis of inaccurate testimony, <b>and she went and ruined</b> herself by engaging in licentious relations outside matrimony, <b>she is liable to</b> bring <b>an offering, as they permitted her only to marry,</b> and not to engage in licentious relations.",

            "The Sages decreed that in the case of a minor girl whose father died, her mother or brothers may marry her off. However, such a marriage does not have the same legal status as the marriage of an adult. Therefore, if the minor regrets having married, she is allowed to make a declaration of refusal to her husband, thereby annulling the marital bond. The Sages disagreed with regard to the details of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say: Only betrothed girls may refuse.</b> A girl may refuse, upon reaching adulthood, to remain married to the man to whom her mother or brothers married her as a minor after the death of her father. <b>But Beit Hillel say</b> that both <b>betrothed and fully married</b> girls may refuse. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Refusal may be directed only <b>at</b> her <b>husband and not at</b> her <b><i>yavam</i>.</b> In such a situation, she must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> in order to dissolve the levirate bond. <b>But Beit Hillel say:</b> It may be directed <b>at</b> her <b>husband or</b> her <b><i>yavam</i>.</b> <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The refusal must take place specifically <b>in the presence of</b> the husband. <b>But Beit Hillel say:</b> It may take place <b>either in his presence or in his absence.

            "<b>Who is a minor girl who needs to perform refusal</b> in order to annul her marriage? <b>Any</b> minor <b>whose mother or brother married her off with her consent.

What does one do under such circumstances? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: We instruct the minor,</b> i.e., his wife, <b>to refuse him,</b> so that her marriage is dissolved and he may then enter into levirate marriage with her adult sister, the widow of his childless brother. <b>Rabban Gamliel says: If</b> the minor <b>refuses</b> of her own accord, <b>her refusal is valid.

The principle that one is completely absolved from levirate marriage when the potential <i>yevama</i> is a forbidden relative does not apply because Torah law does not recognize his marriage to his minor wife. That marriage’s rabbinic sanction does not suffice to render the <i>yevama</i>, his wife’s sister, a forbidden relative who is not a candidate for levirate marriage.",

And shouldn’t a priestess,</b> or any Jewish woman who testifies that a man died, <b>be</b> deemed as credible <b>as an innkeeper?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: When</b> a woman <b>will be as</b> convincing as <b>the innkeeper,</b> then <b>she shall</b> also <b>be deemed credible. The innkeeper brought them his staff, and his bag, and the Torah scroll that was in his possession,</b> thereby providing supporting evidence to reinforce her claim."
