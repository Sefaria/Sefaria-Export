            "A woman is acquired in three ways, and she acquires herself in two ways.  She is acquired through money, through a contract, or through sexual intercourse.  Through money: The House of Shamai say: with a dinar or with the equivalent value of a dinar; and the House of Hillel say: with a peruta or with the equivalent value of a peruta. How much is a peruta? One eighth of the Italian issar.  She acquires herself through a get or through the death of the husband.  A levirate wife is acquired through sexual intercourse, and acquires herself through the shoe-removal ceremony or through the death of the levirate husband.",

[A slave] who is pierced is acquired through piercing, and acquires himself through a Jubilee [year] or through the death of the master.",

The high authority [acquires] by money, and the lay authority [acquires] by establishment of possession.  Speech to the high [authority] is like transfer to the lay [authority].",

Anyone who deals with women, should not be secluded with women. A person should not teach his son a profession that [involves being] among women.  Rabbi Meir says: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy profession, and should pray to the One Whom wealth and possessions are His; for there is no profession which does not have within it poverty and wealth; for poverty is not from the profession and wealth is not from the profession, but rather all is according to his merits.  Rabbi Shimon son of Elazar says: Have you seen in your lifetime a wild animal or bird that has a profession? But they support themselves without trouble; and were they not created only to attend me, while I was created to attend my Creator — is it not logical that I should support myself without trouble? But rather I have made wicked my actions, and been deprived of my support.  Abba Guryan of Tzaidan says in the name of Abba Gurya: and a person should not teach his son to be a donkey-driver, a camel-driver, a barber, a sailor, a storekeeper, or a shepherd, for their profession is a thieves' profession.  Rabbi Yehuda says in his own name: Donkey-drivers are mostly wicked, and camel-drivers are mostly honest, sailors are mostly pious. The best of doctors goes to Hell, and the most honest butchers are the partner of Amalek.  Rabbi Nehorai says: I leave aside all professions in the world, and I teach my son only Torah; for a person eats of its reward in this world, and the principal endures in the world to come. And all other professions are not so — when a person comes into sickness, or into old age, or into suffering, and is not able to be involved in his work, he dies in hunger. But the Torah is not so — but rather it guards him from all evil in his youth, and gives him finality and hope in his old age; In his youth what does it say? \"And those who hope in God shall renew their strength.\" In his old age what does it say? \"They shall still produce in ripe old age.\" Similarly it says by Avraham our Father, peace be upon him — \"And Avraham was old ... and God blessed Avraham in everything.\" We find that Avraham our Father performed the whole entire Torah before it had been given, as it says, \"By reason that Avraham listened to my voice, and kept my safekeeping, my commandments, my statutes and teachings.\"", 
            "R. Yehuda says, an unmarried man should not herd animals, and two unmarried men should not sleep in the same cloth. And the Sages permit it. Anyone who deals with women should not be alone with women. And one should not teach his son a profession [that would cause him to be] among women. R. Meir says, a person should always teach his son a clean (and easy) profession, and he should pray to the One who makes people wealthy and who owns all things, for there is no profession which does not have poverty and wealth. For poverty is not due to one's profession, and wealth is not due to one's profession, but it is all according to one's merit. R. Shimon b. Elazar says, have you seen in all your days a beast or fowl that has a profession? [Yet] they sustain themselves without trouble. And they were created solely to serve me, and I was created solely to serve my Master! So all the more so, I should be able to sustain myself without trouble! However, I did bad with my actions, and I deprived myself of my sustenance. Abba Garin Ish Tzadin says in the name of Abba Geria, a person should not teach his son to be a donkey-driver, a camel-driver, a barber, a sailor, a shepherd, or a shopkeeper, for their professions are the professions of thieves. R. Yehuda says in his name, most donkey-drivers are wicked, and most camel-drivers are honorable. Most sailors are pious. The best physicians [are destined] for hell, and the most honorable butchers are partners with Amalek. R. Nehorai says, I leave all professions in the world and I do not teach my son anything other than Torah, for a person enjoys its reward in this world and the profit continues into the world to come. And this is not the case for the rest of the professions. When a person encounters sickness, or old age, or suffering and is not able to engage in his profession, he will surely die of hunger. But the Torah is not like this, but rather it protects him from all badness in his youth and grants him hope in his old age. Regarding his youth, it says \"Those who wait for the Lord will have their strength renewed\" (Isaiah 40:31). Regarding his old age it says \"They shall still bear fruit in old age\" (Psalms 92:15). And so it says regarding Abraham our father, peace be upon him, \"And Abraham was old...and the Lord blessed Abraham with everything\" (Genesis 24:1). We find that Abraham our father performed the entire Torah [even] before it was given, as it says \"Because Abraham listened to My voice, and he observed My statutes, commandments, laws, and teachings\" (Genesis 26:5)."
