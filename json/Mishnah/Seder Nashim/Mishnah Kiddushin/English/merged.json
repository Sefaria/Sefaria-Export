            "A woman is acquired in three ways, and she acquires herself in two ways.  She is acquired through money, through a document, or through sexual intercourse.  Through money: Beit Shammai say, \"With a <i>dinar</i> [a specific unit of money] or with the equivalent value of a <i>dinar</i>.\" And Beit Hillel say, \"With a <i>perutah</i> or with the equivalent value of a <i>perutah</i>.\" How much is a <i>perutah</i>? One eighth of an Italian <i>issar</i> [a specific unit of money equal to one twenty-fourth of a <i>dinar</i>].  And she acquires herself through a bill  of divorce or through the death of the husband.  A <i>yevamah</i> [a widow whose brother-in-law performed levirate marriage with her] is acquired through sexual intercourse, and acquires herself through <i>chalitzah</i> [the ceremony performed by the widow of a childless man as an alternative way to release herself from the obligation to wait for levirate marriage] or through the death of the <i>yavam</i> [one upon whom has fallen the obligation to perform levirate marriage].", 
            "A Hebrew slave is acquired through money or through a document, and acquires himself through years [of service], through the Jubilee Year, or through prorated monetary [payment]. A Hebrew maidservant has an advantage over him, in that she acquires herself through [physical] signs [of puberty].  [A slave] who [has his ear] pierced is acquired through [the] piercing, and acquires himself through the Jubilee Year or with the death of the master.", 
            "A Canaanite slave is acquired through money, through a document or through <i>chazakah</i> [a presumption of ownership, generally regarding landed property, established by unchallenged, publically known possession for a certain period of time, together with a legally acceptable claim regarding how the property came into the possessor’s hands]. And he acquires himself through money by a third party or through a document by himself. These are the word of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, \"Through money by himself and through a document by a third party, providing that the money be from a third party.", 
            "A large animal is acquired through transfer [of the reins], and a small animal through lifting [it]; these are the words of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar. The Sages say, \"A small animal is acquired through pulling [it].\"", 
            "Mortgaged property is acquired through money, through a document, or through <i>chazakah</i>; and non-mortgaged [property] is acquired only through pulling [it].  Property which is non-mortgaged can be acquired along with mortgaged property through money, through a document or through <i>chazakah</i>;  and that which is non-mortgaged can, [by association,] bind [itself to] that which is mortgaged [to force one] to take an oath regarding [that property].", 
            "Anything that is used as currency for something else, once this [party to the transaction] takes possession [of it], this [other party] is obligated in its exchange. How so? If one exchanges a bull for a cow, or a donkey for a bull, once this one takes possession, this one is obligated for its exchange [i.e., the animal he agreed to exchange for it].  The Temple authority [acquires directly] through money, and the lay authority [acquires] through <i>chazakah</i>.  A verbal statement [declaring an object as belonging] to the Temple [authority] is like [physical] transfer to the lay [authority].", 
            "[With regard to] all commandments of the son which are [incumbent] upon the father, men are obligated, and women are exempt. And [with regard to] all commandments of the father which are [incumbent] upon the son, both men and women are obligated.  And [with regard to] every positive commandment that is time-dependent, men are obligated and women are exempt. And [with regard to] every positive commandment which is not time-dependent, both men and women are obligated.  And [with regard to] every negative commandment, whether it is time-dependent or it is not time-dependent, both men and women are obligated, except for: \"You shall not round off [the corners of your head]\" (Leviticus 19:27), \"You shall not destroy [the corners of your beard]\" (ibid.),  and \"You shall not become ritually impure for the dead\" (Leviticus 21:1).", 
            "The leanings, and the wavings, and the presentations, and the <i>kemitsot</i> [individual handfuls of the meal offering, which the priest takes to be put on the altar], and the incense offerings, and the <i>melikot</i> [instances of utilizing a slaughtering method used for bird sacrifices, employing the thumbnail instead of a knife], and the sprinklings, and the collections of blood are practiced by men, but not by women, except for the meal-offering of the <i>sotah</i> and of the female Nazirite, that they wave [them].", 
            "Any commandment which is dependent on the Land [of Israel] only applies in the Land. And any commandment which is not dependent on the Land applies both in the Land and outside the Land, except for <i>orlah</i> [the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting, the consumption or usage of which is forbidden] and <i>kilayim</i> [the prohibition of  planting together certain plants]. And Rabbi Eliezer says, \"Also <i>chadash</i> [grain from the current year that one is forbidden to eat until after the sixteenth of Nissan]\"", 
            "Anyone who performs a single commandment is bestowed with goodness, his days are lengthened, and he inherits the Land. And anyone who does not perform a single commandment is not bestowed with goodness, his days are not lengthened, and he does not inherit the Land. Anyone who is [involved in] Scripture, the Oral Law, and proper social behavior  will not easily [come to] sin, as it is stated, \"And the three-ply cord is not quickly severed\" (Ecclesiastes 4:12). Anyone who is not [involved in] Scripture, and not in the Oral Law, and not in proper social behavior is not part of civilization."

But the Torah is not so — but rather it guards him from all evil in his youth, and gives him finality and hope in his old age; In his youth what does it say? \"And those who hope in God shall renew their strength.\" In his old age what does it say? \"They shall still produce in ripe old age.\" Similarly it says by Avraham our Father, peace be upon him — \"And Avraham was old ... and God blessed Avraham in everything.\" We find that Avraham our Father performed the whole entire Torah before it had been given, as it says, \"By reason that Avraham listened to my voice, and kept my safekeeping, my commandments, my statutes and teachings.\"", 
            "Rabbi Yehudah says, \"An unmarried man should not herd animals, and two unmarried men should not sleep in the same garment.\" And the Sages permit it. Whoever's business is with women should not be alone with women. And one should not teach his son a profession [that would cause him to be] among women. Rabbi Meir says, \"A person should always teach his son a clean and easy profession, and he should pray to the One to whom wealth and possessions belong, as there is no profession which does not have in it poverty and wealth. For poverty is not due to one's profession, and wealth is not due to one's profession, rather, it is all according to one's merit.\" Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, \"Have you seen in all your days a beast or fowl that has a profession? [Yet] they sustain themselves without trouble. And weren't they created solely to serve me, and I was created to serve my Master. Isn't it logical, then, that I should be able to sustain myself without trouble? However, I my actions were bad, and I deprived myself of my sustenance.\" Abba Garin, a man of Tzaydin says in the name of Abba Guria, \"A person should not teach his son [to be] a donkey-driver, a camel-driver, a barber, a sailor, a shepherd, or a shopkeeper, for their professions are the professions of thieves.\" Rabbi Yehudah says in his name, \"Most donkey-drivers are wicked, and most camel-drivers are honorable. Most sailors are pious. The best physicians [are destined] for hell, and the most honorable among the butchers is the partner of Amalek.\" Rabbi Nehorai says, \"I leave [aside] all professions in the world and I do not teach my son anything other than Torah, for a person enjoys its reward in this world and the principle remains into the world to come.\" And this is not the case for the rest of the professions. When a person encounters sickness, or old age, or suffering and is not able to engage in his profession, he will surely die of hunger. But the Torah is not like this; rather, it protects him from all evil in his youth and grants him an end and hope in his old age. Regarding his youth, what does it say? \"Those who wait for the Lord will have their strength renewed\" (Isaiah 40:31). Regarding his old age what does it say? \"They shall still bear fruit in old age\" (Psalms 92:15). And so it says with regard to Abraham, our father, peace be upon him, \"And Abraham was old...and the Lord blessed Abraham with everything\" (Genesis 24:1). We find that Abraham our father performed the entire Torah [even] before it was given, as it says \"Because Abraham listened to My voice, and he observed My statutes, commandments, laws, and teachings\" (Genesis 26:5)."
