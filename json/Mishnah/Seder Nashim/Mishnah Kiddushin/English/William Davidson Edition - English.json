            "<b>A woman is acquired</b> by, i.e., becomes betrothed to, a man to be his wife <b>in three ways, and she acquires herself,</b> i.e., she terminates her marriage, <b>in two ways.</b> The mishna elaborates: <b>She is acquired through money, through a document, and through sexual intercourse.</b> With regard to a betrothal <b>through money,</b> there is a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that she can be acquired <b>with one dinar or with</b> anything that is <b>worth one dinar. And Beit Hillel say:</b> She can be acquired <b>with one <i>peruta</i>,</b> a small copper coin, <b>or with</b> anything that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The mishna further clarifies: <b>And how much is</b> the value of <b>one <i>peruta</i>,</b> by the fixed value of silver? The mishna explains that it is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>,</b> which is a small silver coin. <b>And</b> a woman <b>acquires herself through a bill of divorce or through the death of the husband. A woman whose husband, who had a brother, died childless [<i>yevama</i></b>], can be <b>acquired</b> by the deceased husband’s brother, the <i>yavam</i>, only <b>through intercourse. And she acquires herself,</b> i.e., she is released from her levirate bond, <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i> or through the death of the <i>yavam</i>.</b>",
            "<b>A Hebrew slave</b> can be <b>acquired</b> by his master <b>through money or through a document, and</b> he can <b>acquire himself,</b> i.e., he is emancipated, <b>through years,</b> i.e., when he completes his six years of labor, <b>or through the</b> advent of the <b>Jubilee</b> Year, <b>or through the deduction of money.</b> The slave can redeem himself during the six years by paying for his remaining years of slavery. <b>A Hebrew maidservant</b> has one mode of emancipation <b>more than him, as she acquires herself through signs</b> indicating puberty. A slave <b>who is pierced</b> after serving six years is <b>acquired</b> as a slave for a longer period <b>through piercing</b> his ear with an awl, <b>and</b> he <b>acquires himself through the</b> advent of the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>or through</b> the <b>death of the master.</b>",
            "<b>A Canaanite slave is acquired by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a document, or by</b> means of the master <b>taking possession</b> of him. <b>And he can acquire himself,</b> i.e., his freedom, <b>by</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by others,</b> i.e., other people can give money to his master, <b>and by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if he accepts it <b>by himself.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> The slave can be freed <b>by</b> means of <b>money</b> given <b>by himself, and by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of manumission if it is accepted <b>by others, provided that the money</b> he gives <b>belongs to others,</b> not to him. This is because the slave cannot possess property, as anything owned by a slave is considered his master’s.",
            "<b>A large domesticated animal is acquired by passing,</b> when its current owner transfers it to a buyer by giving him the reins or the bit. <b>And a small</b> domesticated animal is acquired <b>by lifting.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say: A small domesticated animal can be acquired by pulling</b> also, and there is no need to lift it.",
            "<b>Property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land or other items that are fixed in the earth, <b>can be acquired by</b> means of giving <b>money, by</b> means of giving <b>a document, or by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of it. Property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can be acquired only by pulling. Property that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired</b> along <b>with property that serves as a guarantee by</b> means of giving <b>money, by</b> means of giving <b>a document, or by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of them. The movable property is transferred to the buyer’s possession when it is purchased together with the land, by means of an act of acquisition performed on the land. Generally, one is not obligated to take an oath concerning the denial of a claim with regard to land. The mishna continues: <b>And</b> in a legal dispute involving both land and movable property, if the defendant makes a partial admission of the claim with regard to the movable property, thereby rendering himself obligated to take an oath denying any responsibility for the remaining property, the movable property <b>binds the property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., the land, so that he is forced <b>to take an oath concerning</b> the land as well, despite the fact that one is generally not obligated to take an oath for a claim involving land.",
            "The mishna discusses a transaction involving the barter of two items. With regard to <b>all</b> items <b>used as monetary</b> value <b>for another</b> item, i.e., instead of a buyer paying money to the seller, they exchange items of value with each other, <b>once one</b> party in the transaction <b>acquires</b> the item he is receiving, <b>this</b> party <b>is obligated</b> with regard to the item being <b>exchanged for it.</b> Therefore, if it is destroyed or lost, he incurs the loss. <b>How so?</b> If <b>one exchanges an ox for a cow, or a donkey for an ox, once this</b> party <b>acquires</b> the animal that he is receiving, this party <b>is obligated</b> with regard to the item being <b>exchanged for it.</b> <b>The authority of the Temple</b> treasury effects acquisition <b>by</b> means of <b>money</b> to the seller. <b>And the authority,</b> i.e., the mode of acquisition, <b>of a commoner</b> [<b><i>hedyot</i></b>] <b>is by possession.</b> Furthermore, <b>one’s declaration to the Most High,</b> i.e., when one consecrates an item through speech, <b>is equivalent to transferring</b> an item <b>to a common person,</b> and the item is acquired by the Temple treasury through his mere speech.",
            "With regard to <b>all mitzvot of a son with regard to</b> his <b>father, men are obligated</b> to perform them <b>and women are exempt. And</b> with regard to <b>all mitzvot of a father with regard to his son, both men and women are obligated</b> to perform them. The mishna notes an additional difference between the obligations of men and women in the performance of mitzvot: With regard to <b>all positive, time-bound mitzvot,</b> i.e., those which must be performed at specific times, <b>men are obligated</b> to perform them <b>and women are exempt. And</b> with regard to <b>all positive mitzvot that are not time bound, both men and women are obligated</b> to perform them. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all prohibitions, whether</b> they are <b>time-bound</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>not time-bound, both men and women are obligated</b> to observe them, <b>except for</b> the prohibitions of: <b>Do not round</b> the corners of your head, <b>and: Do not destroy</b> the corners of your beard, which are derived from the verse: “You shall not round the corners of your head and you shall not destroy the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27), <b>and</b> a prohibition that concerns only priests: <b>Do not contract ritual impurity from a corpse</b> (see Leviticus 21:1). These mitzvot apply only to men, not women, despite the fact that they are prohibitions.",
            "With regard to <b>the placing</b> of <b>hands</b> on the head of an offering, <b>and the waving</b> of certain offerings, <b>and the bringing near</b> of meal-offerings to the corner of the altar, <b>and the removal of a handful</b> from meal-offerings, <b>and the burning</b> of sacrificial parts on the altar, <b>and the pinching</b> of bird-offerings, <b>and the collecting</b> of blood of offerings in a vessel, <b>and the sprinkling</b> of blood, these <b>apply to men and not to women.</b> All these mitzvot apply specifically to men and not to women, <b>except for the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i>, and</b> the meal-offering of <b>a nazirite woman, which</b> these women <b>wave.</b>",
            "<b>Any mitzva that is dependent on the land [<i>aretz</i>] applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>and</b> any mitzva <b>that is not dependent on the land applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. This is <b>apart from</b> the mitzvot of <b><i>orla</i> and diverse kinds,</b> which apply even outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to the prohibition to eat from the <b>new crop</b> before the <i>omer</i> offering has been brought on the sixteenth of Nisan.",
            "<b>Anyone who performs one mitzva has goodness bestowed upon him, his life is lengthened, and he inherits the land,</b> i.e., life in the World-to-Come. <b>And anyone who does not perform one mitzva does not have goodness bestowed upon him, his life is not lengthened, and he does not inherit the land</b> of the World-to-Come. <b>Anyone who is engaged in</b> the study of <b>Bible, and in</b> the study of <b>Mishna, and in</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior,</b> i.e., he performs labor and generally acts in an appropriate manner, <b>will not be quick to sin, as it is stated: “And a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). One who is involved in all three of these activities will not sin easily. <b>And anyone who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishna, nor</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior, is not part of society,</b> i.e., he is not considered a civilized person at all."

            "<b>A man can betroth</b> a woman <b>by himself or by</b> means of <b>his agent.</b> Similarly, <b>a woman can become betrothed by herself or by</b> means of <b>her agent. A man can betroth his daughter</b> to a man <b>when she is a young woman,</b> either <b>by himself or by</b> means of <b>his agent.</b> In the case of <b>one who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me with this date,</b> and adds: <b>Be betrothed to me with that</b> one, then <b>if one of</b> the dates <b>is worth one <i>peruta</i> she is betrothed, but if not, she is not betrothed,</b> since he mentioned betrothal in connection with each date.

            "If one said to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that I am a priest, and he was found</b> to be <b>a Levite;</b> or if he said: <b>A Levite, and he was found</b> to be <b>a priest;</b> or if he said: Be betrothed to me on the condition that I am <b>a Gibeonite,</b> a people prohibited by rabbinic law from marrying into the congregation, i.e., from marrying a Jew of fit lineage, <b>and he was found</b> to be <b>a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> who is prohibited by Torah law to marry into the congregation; or he said: <b>A <i>mamzer</i>, and he was found</b> to be <b>a Gibeonite;</b> or if he said: Be betrothed to me on the condition that I am <b>a resident of</b> a small <b>town, and he was found</b> to be <b>a resident of</b> a large <b>city;</b> or he said: <b>A resident of a city, and he was found</b> to be <b>a resident of a town;</b> or if he said: Be betrothed to me <b>on the condition that my house is close to the bathhouse, and it was found</b> to be <b>far;</b> or he said: <b>Far</b> from the bathhouse, <b>and it was found</b> to be <b>close,</b> she is not betrothed.

If he <b>married her without specification, and it was found that there were vows</b> incumbent <b>upon her</b> to fulfill, the marriage takes effect. Nevertheless, he has the right to divorce her, and <b>she is divorced without</b> receiving payment of her <b>marriage contract,</b> as it is assumed that he would not have married her had he known that she was limited by her vows.

With regard to teaching one’s son a trade, <b>Rabbi Meir says: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy trade and pray</b> for success <b>to the One to Whom wealth and property belong, as</b> ultimately <b>there is no trade that does not include</b> both <b>poverty and wealth,</b> since a person can become rich from any profession. <b>Poverty does not</b> come <b>from a</b> particular <b>trade, nor does wealth</b> come <b>from a</b> particular <b>trade,</b> but <b>rather, all is in accordance with</b> a person’s <b>merit.</b> Therefore, one should choose a clean and easy trade, and pray to God for success. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Have you ever seen a beast or a bird that has a trade? And</b> yet <b>they earn their livelihood without anguish. But</b> all these <b>were created only to serve me, and I,</b> a human being, <b>was created to serve</b> the One Who <b>formed me. Is it not right that I should earn my livelihood without anguish? But I,</b> i.e., humanity, <b>have</b> committed <b>evil actions and have lost my livelihood.</b> This is why people must work to earn a living. <b>Abba Guryan of Tzadyan says in the name of Abba Gurya: A person may not teach his son</b> the trades of <b>a donkey driver, a camel driver, a pot maker, a sailor, a shepherd, or a storekeeper.</b> The reason for all these is the same, <b>as their trades are the trades of robbers;</b> all of these professions involve a measure of dishonesty and are likely to lead to robbery. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in</b> Abba Gurya’s <b>name: Most donkey drivers are wicked,</b> since they engage in deceit, <b>and most camel drivers,</b> who traverse dangerous places such as deserts, <b>are</b> of <b>fit</b> character, as they pray to God to protect them on their journeys. <b>Most sailors are pious,</b> since the great danger of the seas instills in them the fear of Heaven. <b>The best of doctors is to Gehenna, and</b> even <b>the fittest of butchers is a partner of Amalek.</b> <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, as a person partakes of its reward in this world and the principal</b> reward <b>remains for him in the World-to-Come, which is not true of other professions,</b> whose rewards are only in this world. Furthermore, <b>if a person comes to be ill, or old, or undergoes suffering, and is unable to be involved in his trade, behold, he dies in hunger. But</b> with regard to <b>the Torah it is not so,</b> since one can study it under all circumstances. <b>Rather, it preserves him from all evil</b> and sin <b>in his youth, and provides him with a future and hope in his old age.</b> The mishna explains: <b>With regard to his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age”</b> (Psalms 92:15), <b>and it likewise states with regard to Abraham our forefather: “And Abraham was old,</b> well stricken in age; <b>and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws”</b> (Genesis 26:5), which indicates that Abraham observed all the mitzvot of his own accord and was rewarded in his old age as a result."
