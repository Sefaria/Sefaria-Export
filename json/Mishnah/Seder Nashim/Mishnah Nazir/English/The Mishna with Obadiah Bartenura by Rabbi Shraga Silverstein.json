            "\tAll epithets (kinuyei) of Naziritism are like Naziritism. [Something which is not the name per se is called a kinui, as in (Bava Metzia 58b) \"hamechaneh shem lechavero\" (\"one who calls his friend by an epithet\")]. If one says: \"I shall be,\" he becomes a Nazirite [This is not a kinui, but is called a \"yad\" (\"hand\"), like a handle by which a vessel is held. In the same way the vow is \"held\" by this expression. Our Mishnah is \"lacking,\" and this is what is meant: All epithets of Naziritism are like Naziritism, and all yadoth of Naziritism are like Naziritism. These are yadoth of Naziritism: If one says: \"I shall be,\" \"I shall be beautified.\" And these are epithets of Naziritism: \"nazik,\" \"naziach,\" \"paziach.\" (\"If one says: 'I shall be,'\":) If he sees a Nazirite passing before him and says: \"I shall be,\" even if he did not say: \"I shall be like this one,\" if his intent were to be a Nazirite like him, he becomes a Nazirite, even though he did not make it explicit.], or (if one says:) \"I shall be beautified,\" he becomes a Nazirite. [If he grasped his hair and said: \"I shall be beautified,\" the implication is: I shall be comely by growing this hair long (as a Nazirite does). If this were his intent, he becomes a Nazirite, even though he did not make it explicit. For these and expressions like them are yadoth of Naziritism, and they are like (assuming) Naziritism (itself).] If one says: \"nazik,\" \"naziach,\" \"paziach,\" he becomes a Nazirite. [They are gentile expressions for a Nazirite, close to the Hebrew, and they are called \"epithets of Naziritism.\"] (If one says:) \"I shall be like this one\" [pointing to a Nazirite near him], \"I shall smooth my hair,\" \"I shall be mechalkel\" [\"mechalkel\" — growing hair, as in (Niddah 52b): \"mishetechalkel ha'atarah,\" when the hair of the pudenda is fully grown.] (If one says:) \"I shall let my hair grow long,\" he becomes a Nazirite. (If one says:) \"I shall bring birds,\" [two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, which are the offering of a Nazirite who has become unclean (This, when a Nazirite passes before him.)], R. Meir says: He becomes a Nazirite. [Since a Nazirite passes before him, and birds are the offering of a Nazirite who has become unclean, it is clear that when he said: \"I shall bring birds,\" he intended Naziritism.] And the sages say: He does not become a Nazirite. [The halachah is in accordance with the sages. He is not a Nazirite, but he brings birds to fulfill his vow.]",
            "\t(If one said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite from chartzanim\" (kernels of grapes)l \"from zagim\" (husks of grapes), \"from shaving,\" or \"from uncleanliness,\" he becomes a Nazirite and all the details of Naziritism apply to him. [If he mentions any one of these, he becomes a Nazirite, as if he had said: \"I shall be a Nazirite,\" unqualified. And because it is taught at the end of the Mishnah that not all the details of Naziritism apply to a perpetual Nazirite (Nazir olam) and a Shimshon Nazirite, it is taught here that all the details of Naziritism apply to him.] (If one said:) \"I shall be like Shimshon,\" like the son of Manoach,\" \"like the husband of Delilah,\" \"like the one who uprooted the doors of Azzah,\" \"like the one whose eyes were gouged out by the Philistines,\" he becomes a Shimshon Nazirite. What is the difference between a perpetual Nazirite and a Shimshon Nazirite? [Our Mishnah is \"lacking,\" and this is what is meant: \"And if he vowed to become a perpetual Nazirite, he becomes a perpetual Nazirite. And what is the difference between a perpetual Nazirite and a Shimshon Nazirite?\"] A perpetual Nazirite — if his hair grows heavy, he can lighten it with a razor [every twelve months. This is derived from (the instance of) Avshalom, who was a perpetual Nazirite, and concerning whom it is written (II Samuel 14;26)): \"And it was at the end of yamim, to the yamim that he would shave; for it became heavy upon him and he would shave it,\" and it is written elsewhere (Leviticus 25:29): \"yamim\" (in context: \"a year of days\") shall be its redemption.\"] and he brings three beasts (on the day that he shaves it). And if he becomes unclean, he brings an offering (to atone) for his uncleanliness. A Shimshon Nazirite — if his hair grows heavy, he may not lighten it, and if he becomes unclean, he does not bring an offering for is uncleanliness. [And he may become unclean even ab initio, for Shimshon would become unclean by (contact with dead bodies), this serving as the source (for the halachah). As to our learning: \"if he becomes unclean,\" which implies \"after the fact,\" but not ab initio — Because it was taught in the first part of the Mishnah in respect to a perpetual Nazirite: \"and if he becomes unclean,\" it is also taught at the end, in respect to a Shimshon Nazirite: \"and if he becomes unclean.\"]",
            "\t\"Naziritism,\" unqualified, is for thirty days, [it being written (Numbers 6:5): \"Holy yiheyeh\" (\"shall he be\"). The gematria (numerical equivalent) of \"yiheyeh\" is thirty — whence they found support for saying that there is no Naziritism for less than thirty days.] (If he said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite, one great [Naziritism],\" \"I shall be a Nazirite, one small [Naziritism]\" — even [if he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite] from now until the end of the world,\" he observes Naziritism for thirty days. [As to his saying: \"from now until the end of the world,\" his intent is: This Naziritism is as long to me as it were from now until the end of the world.] (If he said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite and one day,\" \"I shall be a Nazirite and one hour,\" \"I shall be a Nazirite one and a half,\" he observes two Naziritisms. [If he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite and one day,\" when he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite,\" he accepted upon himself one Naziritism, so that when he added: \"and one day,\" another Naziritism obtains, for there is no Naziritism less than thirty days. Similarly, if he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite and one hour,\" or \"I shall be a Nazirite one and a half,\" two Naziritisms obtain; for it is impossible to be a Nazirite for one hour or (to observe) half a Naziritism without being a Nazirite for thirty days. Accordingly, he observes two Naziritisms. He shaves at the end of thirty days and observes a new Naziritism.] (If he said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite for thirty days and one hour,\" he observes Naziritism for thirty-one days, for there is no Naziritism for hours, [it being written (Ibid. 6): \"the days of his Naziritism\"; and it is as if he had said: \"thirty-one days.\" And we do not say that the \"one hour\" which he mentioned is (a thirty-day) Naziritism in itself, since it can be conjoined to the \"thirty\" which he mentioned before.]",
            "\t(If he said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite like the hair of my head,\" \"like the dust of the earth,\" \"like the sand of the sea,\" he becomes a perpetual Nazirite (Nazir olam) and shaves once every thirty days. [Not a \"Nazir olam,\" literally, for a Nazir olam shaves once every twelve months, whereas this one shaves once every thirty days. Since he linked his Naziritism to distinct things, it is as if he equated the number of his Naziritisms with the number of hairs on his head or the number of dust (particles) on the ground, as opposed to a Nazir olam, who does not divide his Naziritisms but makes it all one Naziritism.] Rebbi says: This one does not shave once every thirty days. [For since he says: \"I shall be a Nazirite,\" it is all one Naziritism, and he shaves only once every twelve months, just as a Nazir olam.] And who does shave once every thirty days? One who says: \"I undertake Naziritism according to the hair of my head,\" \"according to the dust of the earth,\" \"according to the sand of the sea.\" [For in that instance he indicates that he has taken distinct Naziritisms upon himself, as the number of the hairs on his head. The halachah is not in accordance with Rebbi.]",
            "\t(If he said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite a full house,\" or \"a full basket,\" he is examined (i.e., questioned). If he says: I took upon myself one Naziritism [which seemed to me as] great [as the entire house], he becomes a Nazirite for thirty days. And if he says: I simply vowed [and I intended it to mean whatever the sages saw it to signify], the basket is perceived as if it is full of mustard (seeds) and he is a Nazirite all of his days [and he shaves every twelve months.]",
            "\t(If he said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite from here until that place\" [and he kept to the road to go to that place], we estimate the number of days from here to that place — If less than thirty days, he becomes a Nazirite for thirty days; if not, for the number of days (it takes to get there). [But if he did not continue going there, he is regarded as one who said: \"from here until the end of the world,\" and he becomes a Nazirite for thirty days, whether the place were near or far, even a walking (distance) of many years, his intent having been only \"one great Naziritism.\"",
            "\t(If one said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite as the number of the days of the sun, [365 Naziritisms, as the number of the days of the sun], he counts Naziritisms as the number of the days of the sun. R. Yehudah said: There was such an episode. When he completed (his Naziritisms), he died. [R. Yehudah heard that Rebbi differed with the first tanna, ruling that if one said: \"I shall be a Nazirite as the number of the days of the sun,\" he becomes a Nazir olam, and he adduced this episode to show that he does not become a Nazir olam. For in this episode \"he completed (his Naziritisms) and died,\" and with a Nazir olam, \"completion\" does not obtain. It is clear, then, that he counts Naziritisms. And this is the halachah.]"

            "\t(If one said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite from dried figs or pressed figs\" (to which Naziritism does not apply), Beth Shammai say: He becomes a Nazirite, and Beth Hillel say: He does not become a Nazirite. [Beth Shammai hold that one does not utter things in vain, and that when he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite,\" he meant it — so that when he continued: \"from dried figs or pressed figs,\" he meant to retract. And even in the midst of his words he cannot retract, Beth Shammai holding that hekdesh (\"dedication\") in error remains hekdesh, and is susceptible neither of absolution nor retraction. And the same applies to Naziritism, it being written in that regard (Numbers 6:5): \"Holy shall he be\" — for which reason he becomes a Nazirite. And Beth Hillel hold that since he did not vow in the manner of vowers, he does not become a Nazirite, there being no such thing as Naziritism from dried figs or pressed figs.] R. Yehudah said: Even when Beth Shammai said what they did, they said so only when he thought (in his heart): \"They are (forbidden) to me as an offering (is forbidden).\" [Beth Shammai do not differ with Beth Hillel as to his not becoming a Nazirite. They differ only when he says: I intended that the figs be (forbidden) as an offering (is forbidden) to me. Beth Shammai hold him to be bevowed from figs; Beth Hillel do not.]",

Likewise, with a locked door that he could not open, if he said: This door thinks I shall not open it, and it says: \"I shall be a Nazirite if I am opened\"; and I say: I shall be a Nazirite from it if it is not opened! And afterwards the cow stood up of itself without his making it stand, and, similarly, the door opened of itself, or another came and opened it, without his opening it] — Beth Shammai say: He becomes a Nazirite [consistent with their saying that if one bevows himself from dried figs or from pressed figs he becomes a Nazirite, even though there is no Naziritism from figs — Here, too, even though there is no Naziritism from a beast and from a door, he becomes a Nazirite. And even though the beast stood up and the door was opened, his intent was that only he make it stand or open it.] And Beth Hillel say: He is not a Nazirite [according to the words of Beth Shammai. For according to us (Beth Hillel), even if she did not stand up at all he is not a Nazirite, his not having vowed in the manner of the vowers, there being no Naziritism from a beast and from a door. But according to you who say that one does not utter things in vain, and that when he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite,\" he meant it, concede to us, at least, that if it stood up of itself or others stood it up that he does not become a Nazirite, for he said: \"if she does not stand up,\" and she did!] R. Yehudah said: Even when Beth Shammai said what they did, they said so only when he thought (in his heart): \"This cow is (forbidden) to me as an offering if it stands up.\" [Beth Shammai do not differ with Beth Hillel as to his not becoming a Nazirite. They differ only when he says: When I said I would be a Nazirite from it if it did not stand, I meant that this beast should be (forbidden) as an offering — Beth Shammai holding that since he himself did not stand it up, it is an offering, and Beth Hillel holding that since it stood up, it is not an offering.]",

It once happened that a certain inebriated woman was poured a cup and said: \"I shall be a Nazirite from it,\" at which the sages said: \"She intended only to say: 'It is (forbidden) to me (as) an offering.'\" [Our Mishnah is \"lacking,\" and this is what is meant: If he were inebriated and said: \"I shall be a Nazirite from it,\" he does not become a Nazirite, his intent having been only to forbid to himself that cup alone. And so that he not be brought another cup, he said: \"I shall become a Nazirite.\" And it once happened that a certain inebriated women, etc.]",
            "\t(If one said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite on condition that I (be permitted to) drink wine and become unclean to the dead,\" he becomes a Nazirite and is forbidden in all (that is forbidden to a Nazirite). [And in this, all concur, for he thereby makes a condition against what is written in the Torah; and if one makes a condition against what is written in the Torah, his condition is void.] (If one said: \"I shall be a Nazirite,\" and then said:) \"I knew that there was (such a thing as) Naziritism, but I did not know that a Nazirite was forbidden wine,\" he is forbidden (to drink wine). [For wine, shaving, and dead-body defilement, which are forbidden to a Nazirite — if one becomes a Nazirite in respect to one of them, he is a Nazirite in respect to all.] And R. Shimon permits it, [holding that he does not become a Nazirite unless he assumes Naziritism in respect to all.] (If one said: \"I shall be a Nazirite,\" and then said:) \"I knew that a Nazirite was forbidden wine, but I thought that the sages would permit it to me because I cannot live without wine,\" or \"because I bury the dead\" (i.e., that is my occupation), he is permitted, [this being in the class of \"vows of constraint,\" one of the four classes of vows permitted by the sages (Nedarim 3:1-4).] And R. Shimon forbids it, [holding that the four types of vows permitted by the sages require consultation of a sage (for their absolution). The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon in these two cases in our Mishnah.]",
            "\t(If one said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite, and I shall shave a Nazirite,\" [He took upon himself Naziritism and also the bringing of the offerings for another Nazirite], and his fellow heard and said: \"And I [shall be a Nazirite] and I shall shave a Nazirite\" — if they are \"clever,\" the one shaves the other. [Each one exempts his fellow with his offerings, even though when the first vowed to shave a Nazirite, the second was not a Nazirite.]",
            "\t(If one said:) \"I shall shave half a Nazirite,\" and his fellow heard and said: \"And I shall shave half a Nazirite,\" each shaves a complete Nazirite. These are the word of R. Meir. And the sages say: Each shaves half a Nazirite. [R. Meir is consistent with his view that \"the first expression 'takes,'\" so that when he says: \"I shall shave,\" a full shaving is implied, and when he continues: \"half a Nazirite,\" he can no longer retract — even in the midst of his words. And the rabbis hold: \"The vow and its 'opening' are concomitant,\" so that it is as if he would have said: Half the offerings of a Nazirite are upon me (to bring),\" in which instance he is liable only for that. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",

If there were born to him a daughter, a tumtum (one whose genitals are concealed), or an androgynos (a hermaphrodite), he does not become a Nazirite. [For in common parlance, only a male is called \"ben,\" and not a female, a tumtum, or an androgynous.] If he said: (\"I shall be a Nazirite) when I have a valad (offspring),\" even if he had a daughter, a tumtum, or an androgynos, he becomes a Nazirite. [Even a daughter, a tumtum, and an androgynos are called \"valad.\"]",
            "\tIf his wife miscarried [and he did not know if it were a live birth or not], he does not become a Nazirite. [Our Mishnah is in accordance with R. Yehudah, who says that \"one does not place himself in a position of doubt,\" so that when he said: \"when I have a valad,\" he meant a definite (i.e., live) valad.] R. Shimon says: He must say: \"It if were live, I am a Nazirite by obligation; if not, I am a Nazirite by election. [R. Shimon holds that in an instance of doubt as to whether one is or is not a Nazirite, the stringent option must be followed. Therefore, he must be \"a Nazirite by doubt,\" and stipulate: \"If it were live, I am a Nazirite by obligation; if not, I am a Nazirite by election\"; and he shaves and brings his offerings at the end of thirty days. Without this stipulation, he could not bring an offering in doubt. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.] If she subsequently gave birth, he becomes a Nazirite, [not having observed Naziritism for the miscarriage. And now that she bore a live child the Naziritism takes effect.] R. Shimon says: He must say: \"If the first one were live, then the first was obligation, and this, election; and if not, the first was election, and this, obligation.\" [According to R. Shimon it is necessary to stipulate again, for the first may have been live.]",

[If he counted more than seventy days before he began (counting for) the Naziritism of his son, and suspended his own Naziritism to begin the latter — when he shaves himself for the Naziritism of his son and comes to complete the hundred that he vowed for himself, there are found to be fewer than thirty days between the shaving for his sons' Naziritism and the shaving for his own Naziritism.

And if he shaved for the first on the thirtieth day, he shaves for the second on the sixtieth. And if he shaved on the fifty-ninth, it suffices. [For the thirtieth day of the first Naziritism reverts to both. And since the thirtieth day of the first is also counted for the second Naziritism, the thirty days of the second Naziritism end on the fifty-ninth day.] And this testimony was stated by R. Papyas about one who assumed two Naziritism: that if he shaved for the first on the thirtieth day, he was to shave for the second on the sixtieth day. And if he shaved on the fifty-ninth day, it sufficed; for the thirtieth day is included in the reckoning (of the second Naziritism).",

And we do not say that the thirtieth day reverts to both (Naziritisms), that part of the day is like all of the day, except when he shaved and brought offerings on that day.] R. Eliezer says: He offsets only seven days (of purification for his uncleanliness). [For he holds that we say part of the day is like all of the day, and it is as if he became unclean after fulfillment (of his Naziritism). And uncleanliness after fulfillment, according to R. Eliezer, offsets (i.e., adds on) only seven.] (If one said:) \"I shall be a Nazirite for thirty days,\" if he became unclean on the thirtieth day, he offsets the whole, [both according to R. Eliezer and according to the rabbis. For since he said; \"I shall be a Nazirite for thirty days,\" all agree that he requires thirty full days and that we do not say in this instance: \"part of the day is like all of the day.\" And R. Eliezer, who holds (3:4) that one who becomes unclean on the day of fulfillment itself offsets thirty days alone, but not the whole, derives it from (Numbers 6:13): \"And this is the law of the Nazirite on the day of the fulfillment\" — If he became unclean on the day of the fulfillment, \"give him\" the law of the Nazirite; that is, Naziritism in general, thirty days — Here, where he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite for thirty days, and he became unclean on the thirtieth day, which is the day of fulfillment, when he offsets all thirty, he offsets the whole. And the rabbis, too, who differ with R. Eliezer, saying that the one who becomes unclean on the day of fulfillment offsets the whole, even if he counted many days — here, where he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite for thirty days,\" and he became unclean on the day of fulfillment, by offsetting the thirty, he offsets the whole. So that both according to R. Eliezer and according to the rabbis, he offsets the whole. And wherever R. Eliezer and the sages differ, the halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",

Eliezer says: He offsets only thirty, [holding that one who became unclean on the day of fulfillment offsets only thirty.] If he became unclean on the hundred and first day, he offsets thirty days. [The rabbis rule that he offsets thirty days, decreeing the hundred and first day, the day of shaving, by reason of the hundredth day. In any event, they were not so stringent with him as to make it like the hundredth day, the day of fulfillment, which offsets the whole. They decreed only that it offset general Naziritism, which is thirty days.] R. Eliezer sys: It offsets only seven.

[For that offering is prescribed for a Nazirite who was clean and became unclean. In any event, if he were forewarned, he receives stripes.] If he went out and re-entered, they do accrue to the count, and he brings an offering of uncleanliness. [The gemara explains this Mishnah thus: If he went out of the cemetery, and were besprinkled (with the cleansing waters) the third and seventh days, and immersed, and were purified from his uncleanliness, and began to count the days of his Naziritism — even though he afterwards re-entered the cemetery, these days that he counted after he became clean do accrue to him, since cleanliness intervened between the first days that he assumed Naziritism in the cemetery and these latter days. And even though he re-entered the cemetery, the uncleanliness of the cemetery does not offset the number of days that he counted in cleanliness. For only the twelve varieties of uncleanliness stated in respect to Naziritism offset these days. As to \"and he brings an offering of cleanliness,\" this is what is meant: If he became unclean again, with one of the uncleanlinesses which cause a Nazirite to shave, he brings an offering of uncleanliness and offsets (the count). R. Eliezer says; Not on the same day, it being written (Numbers 6:12): \"And the first days shall fall off\" — there must be \"first days.\" [That is, if on the day that he immersed and cleansed himself he became unclean with one of the uncleanlinesses which cause the Nazirite to shave, he does not offset that day, it being written: \"And the first days shall fall off\" — Uncleanliness does not offset until two days of Naziritism have been counted. And the same is true for a Nazirite in general, who became unclean on the first day of his Naziritism — Uncleanliness does not offset that day, but he includes it in the count of the days of his Naziritism. The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer.]",
            "\tIf one assumed many Naziritisms and completed his Naziritism and then came to Eretz Yisrael, [For Naziritism obtains only in Eretz Yisrael because of the uncleanliness of \"the lands of the nations.\" And if one vowed Naziritism outside Eretz Israel, he is obliged to go up to Eretz Yisrael and observe his Naziritism there.], Beth Shammai say: He becomes a Nazirite for thirty days; and Beth Hillel say: He becomes a Nazirite from the beginning.

Eliezer, who says above (3:4) that if one becomes unclean on the day of fulfillment, he offsets only thirty days. Accordingly, he says that Queen Hilni, who became unclean at the end of fourteen years, the day of fulfillment, did not offset the whole and was not required to count another seven years, but only thirty days.

Shimon says: Once one of the bloods (of the offerings) has been sprinkled for him, the Nazirite is permitted to drink wine and to become unclean for the dead, [it being written here: \"And after, the Nazirite may drink wine,\" and elsewhere (Ibid. 19): \"after his shaving of his Naziritism\" — Just as there, after a single act, so here, after a single act — whereby we are taught that once one of the bloods has been sprinkled for him, he is permitted to drink wine and to make himself unclean for the dead.]",

Eliezer it offsets seven days, and, according to the rabbis, thirty.], and his offerings are not credited to him [(the other offerings, that he sacrificed after his invalid shaving.)

Shimon and the rabbis in respect to burnt-offering and peace-offering, \"sin-offering,\" too, is taught)], and then he brought his offerings for their sakes, his shaving is void, and his offerings are not credited to him. If he shaved over the burnt-offering or over the peace-offering not for their sake, and then he brought his offerings for their sakes, his shaving is void and his offerings are not credited to him. [For since they are not credited as the peace-offering and the burnt-offering of a Nazirite, it is as if shaved over a gift burnt-offering or a gift peace-offering.] R. Shimon says: That offering (not for its sake) is not credited to him, but the other offerings are credited to him. [R. Shimon holds that if he shaves over a gift burnt-offering or peace-offering he satisfied the (shaving) requirement. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.] And if he shaved over the three [after all of them were sacrificed], and one of them were found to be fit (kasher) and the others, unfit, his shaving is valid [according to all, viz. (6:7): \"And if he shaved over (any) one of the three, he has satisfied the requirement.\"], and he brings the other offerings.",

Eliezer is consistent with his view that the Nazirite is not permitted to drink wine until all of the (aforementioned acts), after the bringing of all the offerings. So that when he became unclean before he offered all of them, it is as if he became unclean in the morning, before he had offered any of them. And the offering that he brought is reckoned as having been brought before \"fulfillment\" (of his Naziritism).] And the sages say: He may bring the other offerings and become clean. [(That is, when he becomes clean.) And he need not bring again the offering that he brought when he was clean. The rabbis are consistent with their view (6:9) that after a single act it is permitted to drink wine and to shave. Therefore, before he became unclean, he was fit to shave, and that offering is not offset. But the other offerings, which he sacrificed after becoming unclean, are certainly offset, Scripture requiring that all the Nazirite offerings be brought in cleanliness.] They said to him. It happened with Miriam the Tarmodith [(from Tarmod)] that one of the bloods had been sprinkled for her and they came and told her that her daughter was gravely ill — whereupon she went and found that she had died.

(But the possibility of his being an unclean Nazirite does not forbid him to eat consecrated food. For only one whose uncleanliness comes from his own body renders him \"lacking in atonement,\" which forbids the eating of consecrated offerings.) How so? If he vowed Naziritism for thirty days, and on the first day he incurred possible dead-body uncleanliness and possible leprosy, he sprinkles, and repeats, and immerses, and is cleansed of dead-body uncleanliness, as if he would come to shave as an unclean Nazirite or as a leper who had been healed. But he cannot shave until thirty days from the time he vowed Naziritism. For he might be a clean Nazirite, who is forbidden to shave until the fulfillment of the days of his Naziritism until he brings his offerings. And after thirty days he shaves: possibly the shaving of a leper, possibly the shaving of an unclean Nazirite, possibly the shaving of a clean Nazirite. And he brings two birds, as per the halachah of the shaving for the confirmation of a leper: a bird sin-offering, on the possibility of his being an unclean Nazirite, and a beast burnt-offering, on the possibility of his being a clean Nazirite. And even though he does not bring the other offerings of the shaving of cleanliness, we have already stated that if he shaved over one of the three, he has satisfied the requirement. And he makes the condition that if he is not a clean Nazirite, it is to be a gift burnt-offering. And the law of a confirmed leper is that he requires two shavings: one after the end of his confirmation, when he is healed of his leprosy; a second, after the days of his counting, after having counted seven days from the first shaving, viz. (Leviticus 14:9): \"And it shall be on the seventh day that he shall shave all of his hair.\" But his possibly being a Nazirite makes him unable to shave. Therefore, he must wait thirty days of possible clean Naziritism and shave for the possible days of counting of a leper and of possible clean Naziritism. And he brings a beast burnt-offering of possible Naziritism in order to shave over the offerings, and he makes the condition (above) over them. And on the morrow of the day of his shaving, he brings the offering of the leper to allow him to eat consecrated food, and a bird sin-offering. For a beast offering is not brought for a possibility, and he does not bring a guilt-offering, (the lack of) a guilt-offering not preventing one from eating consecrated food. It is found, then, that at the end of sixty days he eats consecrated food. For it is then that he brings his atonement for the possibility of confirmed leprosy], and he may drink wine and make himself unclean for the dead after a hundred and twenty days. For the shaving of a leper overrides the shaving of a Nazirite (only) when it (his being a leper) is certain; but if it is in doubt, it does not override. [He is still forbidden to drink wine and to make himself unclean for the dead, for he might have been a confirmed leper. And the shaving for leprosy does not satisfy the requirement of shaving for clean Naziritism or for unclean Naziritism, so that two additional Naziritisms are required — one for clean Naziritism and one for unclean Naziritism. And if he were a confirmed leper then all that he counted for the days of his Naziritism is not credited to him, the days of his confirmation and the days of his counting not being credited to him. He must, therefore, count another thirty days, and after those thirty days, he shaves — possibly as an unclean Nazirite, possibly as a clean Nazirite. And he brings a bird sin-offering on the possibility of unclean Naziritism, and a beast burnt-offering on the possibility of clean Naziritism in order to shave over the offering. And he makes the condition (above) over it. But he still is forbidden to drink wine and to make himself unclean for the dead. For he might have been a confirmed leper, in which instance the first two shavings would not have been credited to Naziritism, neither unclean nor clean. And he might have been an unclean Nazirite, so that the third shaving would have been for uncleanliness. Therefore, he must count another thirty days for clean Naziritism and bring the offering of a clean Nazirite and make the condition — after which he is permitted to drink wine and to make himself unclean for the dead. Likewise, if he vowed Naziritism for a year, and he incurred possible dead-body uncleanliness at the beginning of the year, and possibly leprosy, he counts a year and shaves for: possibility of uncleanliness, possibility of cleanliness, possibility of leprosy. And he counts a second year and shaves and brings his atonement, and eats consecrated food. And he counts another two years before he can drink wine and make himself unclean for the dead.]"

A stringency of women over bondsmen: One can force his bondsman [to drink wine and to make himself unclean for the dead], but he cannot force his wife.

Likewise, with all oaths sworn by a bondsman, whether or not they are vows of affliction, his master need not force him, for they are voided of themselves, the bondsman having no jurisdiction over himself. But a bondsman is obligated to fulfill vows which do not entail affliction or abstention from his master's work, and his master cannot force their voidance.] A stringency of bondsmen over women: He can annul the vows of his wife, but he cannot annul the vows of his bondsman.

But if he forced his bondsman to transgress his vow and then desired him to fulfill it, he must fulfill it. ] If he annulled his wife's (Naziritism), it is \"eternally\" annulled.

[Not literally, \"annulled\"; but if he forced his bondsman to drink wine or to make himself unclean for the dead, and then the bondsman went out free, he must complete his Naziritism. Rambam explains: If one says to his bondsman: \"It (your Naziritism) is annulled,\" the master's rights in him dissolve, the bondsman gains his freedom thereby, and he must complete his Naziritism. (I am uneasy with this interpretation.)] If he (the bondsman) fled from him [after he had vowed Naziritism], R. Meir says: He should not drink (wine) [so that he be aggrieved and return to his master, who will force him to transgress his vow, and thus permit him to drink wine.] R.

[If it became known to him that in the place he had passed through there were \"uncleanliness of the depths,\" i.e., uncleanliness which no one, even in the ends of the world, was aware of, even though it were definitely unclean, it does not offset, this being a halachah of Naziritism.] If [it became known to him] before he shaved, in either event, [whether it were known uncleanliness or uncleanliness of the depths], it offsets, [for the halachah that uncleanliness of the depths does not offset applies only after the shaving of cleanliness]. How so? [i.e., What is \"uncleanliness of the depths\"?] If he went down to immerse himself in (the waters of) a cave, and he found (matter from) a dead body floating on the surface of the cave, he is unclean. [If he were unclean with creeping-thing uncleanliness, or with something similar — not dead-body uncleanliness — and he went down to immerse (and cleanse himself) from his uncleanliness, and he found an olive-size (of matter) from a dead body floating on the surface of the water, and he were in doubt as to whether he had or had not become unclean, he is unclean. (As to the ruling that in the instance of uncleanliness floating on the surface of the water, he is clean, that refers to creeping-thing uncleanliness, but with dead-body uncleanliness, he is unclean.) And if this possibility became known to him after he had shaved, he is unclean. For this is known uncleanliness, since it was in a place where people would see it. As to its being stated: \"If he went down to immerse,\" this is to strengthen the point, i.e., even though one who goes down to immerse from uncleanliness to cleanliness guards himself against all manner of uncleanliness, he is still unclean.] If it were found embedded in the soil of the cave [in the place where he immersed, so that he had become unclean of a certainty — if it became known to him after he had shaved, he is clean, and it does not offset (the Naziritism), this being \"uncleanliness of the depths,\" it not having been known to anyone.], if he had gone down to cool off, he is clean. [Even if he had gone down to cool off, and not to immerse himself (in which instance he would take care to guard himself against uncleanliness), even so, he is clean], but (if he had gone down) to cleanse himself from dead-body uncleanliness, he is unclean.

For a status of clean remains clean and a status of unclean remains unclean.] For there is a rationale for this, [for saying that the halachah that a Nazirite in the instance of \"uncleanliness of the depths\" is clean applies if he were in a status of clean, and not if he were in a status of unclean.]",

This explains \"from four cubits until eight.\" (\"the full space of a litter and its buriers\" is to be omitted)] He examines from it onwards twenty cubits, [For the crypt was four cubits by six, and the space that the crypt opened onto, six by six on either side (as per the view of the rabbis. Bava Bathra 102b), so that the length of two crypts and the space between them was eighteen cubits. And because sometimes he examines one crypt on its diagonal, which is approximately two cubits longer, there are twenty cubits (to examine): eight of the first crypt, six of the intervening space, and six of the second crypt (for one diagonal is posited, but not two). This accounts for \"twenty.\" (And he must further examine twenty cubits from top to bottom, forty cubits.) For this might be the crypt at the east of the space, and there might be another opposite, at the west of the space. Or this might be the crypt at the west of the space, and there might be another at the east of the space.] If he found one at the end of twenty cubits, he examines from it onwards twenty cubits. [For who is to say that that crypt is part of this burial ground? Perhaps it is part of a different ground belonging to a different person. And all of the above examinations must, likewise, be made here. For just as there is a grave there, there might be others.] For there is a rationale for this [i.e., for saying that this field was made for graves, and that there were also other crypts there.

[For if he \"saw\" (i.e., if the discharge was) by accident, he is clean, this being derived from (Leviticus 15:2): \"…if there be a discharge from his flesh\" — from (the nature of) his flesh, and not by accident.] This, so long as he had not been uncleanliness-linked. [That is, until the second sighting, when he becomes a confirmed zav, to produce lying and sitting uncleanliness. But at the first sighting, he produces uncleanliness until evening, as a ba'al keri (one with a seminal discharge), and it combines with the second even if it were by accident.] (the seven ways:) through eating [eating things conducive to zivah (the genital discharge), e.g., fat meat, milk, cheese, eggs, and old wine], through drinking [an abundance of drinking], through carrying [heavy loads], through jumping, through sickness, through looking [seeing a beautiful woman, even without thinking about her], and through thinking [even without looking. If he experienced any of these before the second sighting, he does not become a zav, and the drop does not produce carrying uncleanliness.] Once he has become zivah-linked [i.e., after the second-sighting, not by accident], he is not examined. [And even if the third sighting were by accident, he becomes a zav liable for an offering]. And his \"doubt\" and his semen are unclean, [his doubt because of his semen, i.e., if he saw semen first and a drop of zivah afterwards, it does not produce uncleanliness. For one who sees semen does not produce zivah uncleanliness for twenty-four hours. As long as he has not become zivah-linked, the semen \"cleanses\" the zivah, as having been caused by accident. But after he had become uncleanliness-linked, the semen does not cleanse the zivah, it not being assumed that the zivah discharge was produced by the seminal discharge]. For there is a rationale for this [i.e., for saying that the zivah sighting was not caused by accident, since he had already become a zav.] If a man struck his neighbor and he were diagnosed as dying, and then his condition improved, and then it worsened and he died, he (the smiter) is liable. R. Nechemiah says: He is not liable, for there is a rationale for this [i.e., for saying that he did not die because of the blow; for his condition had improved after it. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Nechemiah.]",
            "\tShmuel was a Nazirite [And if one says: \"I shall be like Shmuel\" or \"like the son of Elkanah,\" or \"like the one who clove Agag in Gilgal,\" he becomes a Nazirite according to R. Nehorai. And this is the halachah.] As R. Nehorai said: It is written (I Samuel 1:11): \"And morah shall not come upon his (Shmuel's) head.\" And, in respect to Shimshon (Judges 13:5): \"And morah (a razor) shall not come upon his head, for a Nazirite of G d shall he be.\" Just as \"morah\" in respect to Shimshon refers to Naziritism, so \"morah\" in respect to Shmuel refers to Naziritism. R. Yossi demurred: Is (the first) morah not \"fear\" of flesh and blood? [i.e., that Shmuel not be in fear and awe of men] R. Nehorai answered: But is it not already written (I Samuel 16:2): \"And Shmuel said: 'How can I go (to anoint David)? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me!'\" which indicates that he did fear flesh and blood (so that \"morah\" in respect to Shmuel must mean a razor, and not fear.)"
