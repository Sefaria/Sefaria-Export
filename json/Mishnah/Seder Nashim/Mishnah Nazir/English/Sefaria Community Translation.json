What is the difference between an eternal Nazirite and a Samsonian Nazirite? An eternal Nazirite, if his hair weighs heavily on him, he may lighten it with a razor and offer up three animals. And if he becomes impure, he offers up a sacrifice for impurity. A Samsonian Nazirite, if his hair weighs heavily on him, he may not lighten it. And if he becomes impure, he does not offer up a sacrifice for impurity.",

And a High Priest shall not become impure, for his holiness is eternal holiness.\"",
            "For these impurities a <i>nazir</i> shaves: for the corpse; for an olive's volume from the dead; for an olive's volume of a decaying corpse; for a spoonful of rotted corpse; for the spine, for the skull, and for a limb from a corpse; for a limb from a living [person] that has flesh on it in the proper amount; for half a <i>kav</i> [a specific unit of volume] of bones; for half a <i>log</i> [a specific unit of volume] of blood; for touching them, carrying them, or being tented with them. And  for a bone the size of a barley corn, for touching it or carrying it. For these the <i>nazir</i> shaves, and is sprinkled on the third and seventh [days], and invalidates the preceding [period]. And he does not start to count [again] until he is purified and brings his sacrifices.",
            "But overhanging branches, protruding hedges or stones,  or <i>beit haperas</i> [a field in which a grave has been lost or plowed over. Due to the doubt as to whether bones were scattered, the field renders those who touch it impure by rabbinic decree, and there are methods to check the field and cross without becoming impure], land of the [other] nations, the top stone of a coffin, the coffin frame, or a <i>revi'it</i> [a specific volume] of blood, or a tent, or a quarter [<i>kav</i>] of bones, or tools touching a corpse, or his days of counting [cleanliness after purification from leprosy], or his days of surety [as a leper]; a <i>nazir</i> does not shave on account of any of these things. He is sprinkled [with blood] on the third and seventh [days], but they do not invalidate [the days] that came before, and he starts and counts [again] immediately, and has no [need for a] sacrifice. Truly, the days of a <i>zav</i> [a male who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, which render him impure] and a <i>zavah</i> [a female who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, distinct from her menses, which render her impure] and the days of quarantine of a leper are counted for him.",
            "Rabbi Eliezer said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: \"Any impurity from a corpse for which a <i>nazir</i> shaves, one is liable for it [if] one enters the Temple. And any impurity from a corpse for which a <i>nazir</i> does not shave, one is not liable for it [if] one enters the Temple.\" Rabbi Meir said: \"This should not be less stringent than [the impurity caused by] a <i>sheretz</i> [creeping animal].\" Rabbi Akiva said: \"I have disputed before Rabbi Eliezer, 'Just as a bone [the size] of a barley corn does not defile a person under a tent and a <i>nazir</i> shaves for touching it or carrying it, for a <i>revi'it</i> of blood which does defile a man under a tent - should it not also be the rule that a <i>nazir</i> shaves for touching it or carrying it?' He replied to me, 'What is this, Akiva? We are not ruling here through <i>kal vachomer</i> [<i>a fortiori</i> reasoning].' When I came and lectured about these matters before Rabbi Yehoshua, he said to me, 'You have spoken well, but thus have they [the Sages] said is the law.'\""

            "There are two <i>nezirim</i> (a person who swears abstention from all grape products like wine, from cutting his hair, and avoidance of corpse impurity), where another said to them, \"I saw one of you become impure and I do not know which of you,\" They [both] shave and bring an offering for impurity and an offering for purity and [one] says, \"If I am the impure one, the offering for impurity is mine and the offering for purity is yours. But if I am the pure one, the offering for purity is mine, and the offering of impurity is yours\"' Then they count thirty days, and bring an offering for purity, and [one] says, \"If I am the impure one, the offering of impurity is mine, and the offering for purity is yours, and this is the offering of my purity. And if I am the pure one, the offering of purity is mine, and the offering of impurity is yours, and this is the offering of your purity.\" If one of them died, Rabbi Yehoshua said: \"[The other one] seeks one from the market who will vow as a <i>nazir</i> in place of him [the dead one], and he [the living one] says, 'If I was impure, behold you are immediately a <i>nazir</i>. But if I was pure, behold you are a <i>nazir</i> after thirty days.' Then they count thirty days, and then bring an offering for purity and an offering for impurity, and [one] says: 'If I am the impure one, the offering for impurity is mine, and the offering for purity is yours. And if I am the pure one, the offering for purity is mine, and the offering for impurity is [offered] with uncertainty.' Then they count thirty days and bring an offering for purity and [one] says, 'If I am the impure one, the offering for impurity is mine and the offering for purity is yours, and this is my offering for purity. But if I am the pure one, the offering for purity is mine, and the offering for impurity is [offered] in uncertainty, and this is the offering of your impurity.'\" Ben Zoma said to him: \"And who will listen to him in that he will vow to become a <i>nazir</i> in place of him [the dead one]? Rather, he brings a sin-offering of a bird and a burnt-offering of an animal, and says, 'If I was impure, the sin-offering is for my obligation and the burnt-offering is a donation. If I was pure, the burnt-offering is for my obligation and the sin offering is [offered] with uncertainty.' Then he counts thirty days and brings an offering of purity, and says, 'If I was impure, the initial burnt-offering was a donation and this is an obligation. If I was pure, the initial burnt-offering was an obligation, this is a donation, and this is the rest of my offering.\" Said Rabbi Yehoshua: \"It would turn out that this one brings his offerings in parts.\" But the Sages agreed with Ben Zoma.",
            "A <i>nazir</i> who is impure with uncertainty and a decided [leper] with uncertainty [may] eat from  <i>kodashim</i> (sacrifices which may only be eaten in a pure state) after sixty days and may drink wine and can become impure through corpses after one hundred and twenty days; for shaving due the <i>nega</i> (diseased patch on the skin) overrides the shaving of <i>nazir</i> [only] at the time when it is certain. But when it is uncertain, it does not override."

            "Non-Jews do not have a <i>nazir</i> (a person who swears abstention from all grape products like wine, from cutting his hair, and avoidance of corpse impurity) vow. Women and slaves do have a <i>nazir</i> vow. A stringency with women over slaves is that one may force his slave [to violate his vow], but one may not force his wife. A stringency with slaves over women is that one may annul his wife's vows, but may not annul his slave's vows. [If] he annuls for his wife, it is annulled forever. [If] he annuls for his slave, [if the slave] goes free, he completes his <i>nazir</i> vow. [If] he ran away from before him, Rabbi Meir says, \"He may not drink [wine],\" but Rabbi Yose says, \"He may drink.\"",
            "A <i>nazir</i> who [already] shaved and it becomes known to him that he is impure, if it was a known impurity, [his term] is void. But if it was impurity of the depths (hidden) it is not void. If it was before he shaved, in either case it would be void. How [does this work]? If he went down to immerse in a cave and a corpse was found floating at the entrance of the cave, he is impure. [If] it was found sunken on the bottom of the cave, if he went down to cool off, he is pure. [If he went down] to purify from the impurity from a corpse is impure. For one already held in a state of impurity [remains] impure, and one held in a state of purity [remains] pure, for this matter has a leg on which to stand upon (there is support behind the logic).",
            "One who initially finds [one] corpse buried normally, he [may] move it and its surrounding dirt. [If] he found two, he [may] move them along with their surrounding dirt. [If] he found three: if there are four to eight cubits from one to the next, this is a graveyard. He checks from it twenty cubits outward. [If] he found one [corpse] twenty cubits away, he checks from this one twenty cubits outward. This matter has a leg on which to stand, even though, had he found this one first, he [could] move it and its surrounding dirt. ",
            "Initially, any doubt about <i>negaim</i> (diseased patches on skin, clothes, or houses that create impurity) is [ruled as] pure as long as it has not been declared impure. Once it is declared impure, doubts about it are [ruled as] impure. We investigate a <i>zav</i> (a male who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, which render him impure) about seven categories before he is declared as having discharge: about food, drink, lifting, jumping, sickness, visual stimuli, and thoughts. From the time he is declared as having discharge, we do not investigate him. His accidental [discharges], doubtful [discharges], and seminal discharges are [considered] impure because the matter has a leg on which to stand.  One who hits his fellow and they estimate that he will die, and then he improves from what was: If after that it degrades and he dies, he [the one who struck] is liable. Rabbi Nechemia says, \"He is exempt because the matter has a leg on which to stand\".",
            "\"Shmuel was a <i>nazir</i>,\" according to the words of Rabbi Nehorai, \"As it says, 'And a <i>moreh</i> (meaning \"razor\") will not come upon his head.' (1 Samuel 1:11)  It says about Shimshon , \"And a <i>moreh</i>,\" (Judges 13:5) and it says about Shmuel, \"And a <i>moreh</i>\" (1 Samuel 1:11). Just like <i>moreh</i> is said in regards to Shimshon - a <i>nazir</i> - so too <i>moreh</i> which is said in regards to Shmuel [means he was a] <i>nazir</i>.\" Rabbi Yose said, \"But is it not [the case that]  <i>moreh</i> (meaning \"fear\") only applies to [being] of humans?\" Rabbi Nehorai responded to him, \"But is it not already said, 'Then Shmuel said 'How can I go? Shaul will hear and kill me.' Therefore, he did have <i>moreh</i> of humans on him.\""
