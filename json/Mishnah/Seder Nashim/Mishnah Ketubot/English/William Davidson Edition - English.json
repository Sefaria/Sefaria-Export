            "With regard to <b>a virgin, her marriage contract is two hundred dinars, and</b> with regard to <b>a widow,</b> her marriage contract <b>is one hundred</b> dinars.

            "Several disputes between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua were cited previously with regard to the credibility accorded to the respective claims of parties to a dispute. Based on one of those disputes, the <i>tanna</i> adds: <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua concedes in</b> a case where <b>one says to another: This field,</b> which is currently in my possession, <b>belonged to your father and I purchased it from him, that he is deemed credible,</b> and his entire claim is accepted. The court accepts not only his admission that it once belonged to the other’s father, but also his statement that he purchased it. This is so, <b>as the mouth that prohibited,</b> i.e., claimed that the field had belonged to the other’s father, <b>is the mouth that permitted,</b> i.e., claimed that he purchased the field. Even if he had not admitted that it had belonged to the other’s father, the field would have remained in his possession.

            "Rabbi Yehuda says: One does not elevate a man <b>to priesthood on the basis of one witness.</b> Two witnesses are required for that purpose. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: When</b> is that the ruling? In a case <b>where there are challengers</b> to his claim that he is a priest. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where there are no challengers, one elevates</b> a man <b>to priesthood on the basis of one witness.

            "In the case of <b>a woman who was imprisoned by gentiles due to a monetary</b> offense committed by her husband, once she is released after he pays his debt, <b>she is permitted to her husband,</b> even if he is a priest. There is no concern that they violated her because their objective is to coerce the husband to pay his debt in exchange for her release. Were they to abuse her, it is possible that he would be unwilling to pay. However, if a woman was imprisoned <b>due to a capital</b> offense and sentenced to death, once she is released <b>she is forbidden to her husband</b> even if he is not a priest due to the concern that perhaps her captors violated her, and she acquiesced to one of them. With regard to <b>a city that was conquered by</b> an army laying <b>siege, all the women</b> married to <b>priests located in</b> the city <b>are unfit</b> and forbidden to their husbands, due to the concern that they were raped. <b>And if they have witnesses, even</b> if the witness is <b>a slave, even</b> if the witness is <b>a maidservant,</b> both of whom are generally disqualified as witnesses, <b>they are deemed credible. And a person is not deemed credible</b> to establish his status <b>by his own</b> testimony. Therefore, a woman is not deemed credible to claim that she was not violated. <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav said:</b> I swear by <b>this abode</b> of the Divine Presence that my wife’s <b>hand did not move from my hand from the time that the gentiles entered Jerusalem until they left,</b> and I know for a fact that she was not defiled. The Sages <b>said to him: A person cannot testify about himself.</b> The legal status of one’s wife is like his own status in this regard. Therefore, your testimony is not accepted, and your wife is forbidden to you.",
            "<b>And these are deemed credible to testify in their majority</b> with regard to <b>what they saw in their minority. A person is deemed credible to say: This is my father’s handwriting, and</b> to say: <b>This is my teacher’s handwriting; and</b> to say: <b>This is my brother’s handwriting,</b> even though he never saw their handwriting after reaching majority. § Similarly, one is deemed credible to say: <b>I was reminded of</b> the wedding of <b>so-and-so, who went out with a <i>hinnuma</i>, or</b> with <b>her hair uncovered</b> in a manner typical of virgins, and therefore, her marriage contract is two hundred dinars; <b>and</b> to say <b>that so-and-so would leave school to immerse</b> in order <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>, and that he would share</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>with us at the threshing floor</b> and therefore he is a priest. Similarly, one is deemed credible to say: <b>This place is a <i>beit haperas</i>,</b> a field with a grave that was plowed, scattering the bones, and rendering the field a place of uncertain ritual impurity; <b>and</b> to say: <b>Until here we would come on Shabbat</b> and thereby determine the Shabbat boundary. <b>However, a person is neither deemed credible to say: So-and-so had a path in this place;</b> nor to say: <b>So-and-so had</b> a tract of land where they would perform the ritual of <b>standing</b> and sitting <b>and</b> deliver <b>a eulogy in that place,</b> thereby attesting that the land belongs to that person. The reason he is not deemed credible in those cases is that full-fledged testimony is required to remove property from the possession of its presumptive owner."

The mishna resumes its list of the cases of young women who are not entitled to a fine when raped or seduced by the following men: In the case of <b>one who engages in intercourse with his daughter, with his daughter’s daughter, with his son’s daughter, with his wife’s daughter, with her son’s daughter,</b> or <b>with her daughter’s daughter; they do not</b> receive payment of <b>a fine.</b> That is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, and <b>that their death</b> penalty is administered by <b>the court, and anyone who is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>does not pay money, as it is stated: “And yet no harm follow, he shall be punished”</b> (Exodus 21:22). This verse indicates that if a woman dies and the one who struck her is liable to receive the death penalty, he is exempt from payment.",
            "With regard to <b>a young woman who was betrothed and divorced,</b> and then raped, <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: She does not</b> receive payment of a <b>fine</b> for her rape. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: She</b> receives payment of a <b>fine</b> for her rape <b>and her fine</b> is paid <b>to herself,</b> not her father, as since she was betrothed and divorced she is no longer subject to her father’s authority.",
            "<b>The seducer gives</b> the father of his victim <b>three things, and the rapist</b> gives the father <b>four.</b> The mishna specifies: <b>The seducer gives</b> the father payments for <b>humiliation, degradation, and</b> the <b>fine.

What</b> are the differences <b>between</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a rapist and</b> that of <b>a seducer?

            "The mishna clarifies: <b>How does</b> the rapist <b>drink from his vessel?

However, if <b>a matter of licentiousness is found in her,</b> e.g., if she committed adultery, <b>or if she is unfit to enter the Jewish people,</b> e.g., if she is a <i>mamzeret</i>, <b>he is not permitted to sustain her</b> as his wife, <b>as it is stated: “And to him she shall be as a wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), from which it is inferred that she must be <b>a woman who is</b> legally <b>suitable for him.</b>",

            "<b>What is humiliation?</b> How is the payment for humiliation during rape or seduction assessed?

            "<b>There were two</b> prominent <b>judges</b> who issued <b>decrees in Jerusalem, Admon and Ḥanan ben Avishalom.

The oath is to the effect that he did not leave her any funds when he departed overseas, as she is claiming full payment of her marriage contract. <b>And she does not take an oath at the outset</b> of his trip overseas, when she demands support soon after his departure. <b>The sons of High Priests disagreed with</b> Ḥanan’s opinion <b>and said: She takes an oath</b> both <b>at the outset and at the end. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with their statement,</b> i.e., that of the sons of the High Priests. <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said</b> that <b>Ḥanan spoke well: She takes an oath only at the end.</b>",

Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Ḥanan spoke well</b> in this case, as this man is like one who <b>placed his money on the horn of a deer</b> in midflight, i.e., he has no reasonable expectation of reimbursement.",

If <b>he established</b> that field <b>as a marker for another</b> field, everyone agrees that <b>he</b> has <b>lost his right.</b> In other words, if the claimant wrote a document concerning another field and in that document he listed the first field as a boundary marker and described it as belonging to someone else, even Admon concedes that he has lost his right, as he had no reason to say it belonged to someone else other than his belief this was in fact the case.",
