            "\tA virgin is married on the fourth day [and not on the night preceding the fifth day, for we apprehend that he might then be preoccupied with the wedding and not be able to cohabit], and a widow on the fifth day. For the batei-din convene in the cities twice a week, on the second day and the fifth day, so that if he have a claim of (absence of) virginity, [such as: \"I cohabited and did not find blood,\" whether she be a minor, a na'arah, or a bogereth, or: \"I found an open door,\" if she were a minor or a na'arah (but not if she were a bogereth)], he can rise early to beth-din [when his anger is still upon him, lest he be assuaged and \"cool off,\" and keep her; and it may be that she were adulterous under him (i.e., during the time of betrothal), in which instance she is forbidden to him. The gemara asks: Let him marry her on the first day, and if he has a claim of virginity, he can rise early to beth-din on the second day. And it answers: The sages were solicitous of the welfare of the daughters of Israel, that the groom occupy himself with the (wedding) feast three days: the first, second, and third day, and that on the fourth day he marry her. And when batei-din do not sit on the second and fourth days, a woman can be married on any day, provided that he occupy himself with the feast for three days. And out of solicitude for the poor, it is the custom in some places to marry on Sabbath eve. The reason that a widow is wed on the fifth day is that the sages were solicitous of the welfare of the daughters of Israel, so that (in this instance) he can rejoice with her three days — the fifth, the sixth, and the Sabbath. One who marries a widow is forbidden to work for three days and one who marries a virgin may not work all seven. As to birchath chathanim (\"the blessings of the groom\"), both a man being married for the first time, who weds a widow, and a widower who weds a virgin, bless birchath chathanim all seven days. And a widower who weds a widow blesses birchath chathanim one day.]",
            "\tThe kethubah of a virgin is two manah, and of a widow, one manah. A virgin who is a widow or a divorcée or a chalutzah from betrothal [and who remarried] — her kethubah [from the second] is two manah, and she is subject to a claim of virginity [i.e., if the second found her not to be a virgin, she loses her kethubah, it having been a \"mistaken purchase\"; for he had married her on the assumption that she was a virgin.] A proselyte, and a captive, and a bondsmaid, who had been redeemed and proselytized and freed (when they were) less than three years and one day old — their kethubah is two manah, and they are subject to a claim of virginity.",

These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say: The kethubah of a mukkath etz is one manah. [The halachah is in accordance with them. And even if he were not aware of it, her kethubah is one manah, and it is not a \"mistaken purchase.\"]",

A proselyte, and a captive, and a bondsmaid, who had been redeemed and divorced and freed (when they were) more than three years and one day — their kethubah is one manah, and they are not subject to a claim of virginity.",

[When they made the betrothal feast in the house of the bride's father in Judah, it was the practice that the groom be left alone with her to become familiar with her. Therefore, when he afterwards married her, he did not have a claim of virginity.] Both the kethubah of the widow of an Israelite and that of the widow of a Cohein are one manah. A beth-din of Cohanim would claim four hundred zuz for (the kethubah of) a virgin (who was the daughter of a Cohein), and the sages did not protest.",

Gamliel and R. Eliezer say: She is believed [and she is made to swear a shevuath heseth (an oath in equity) that it is as she says, and she takes her kethubah. And this is the halachah. And if she says: \"He found me a virgin,\" she is not believed, the sages having believed the husband, even without an oath; for it is premised that a man does not exert himself with the (marriage) feast only to lose it.] R. Yehoshua says: \"We do not live by her mouth,\" but she is assumed to have been lived with before she was betrothed and that she deceived him, unless she brings proof for her words.",

Gamliel and R. Yehoshua say: She is believed [and she is permitted to the priesthood], and R. Yehoshua says: We do not live by her mouth; but she is assumed to have been lived with by a Nathin or a mamzer unless she brings proof for her words.",

Gamliel does not say that this fetus inherits him (the one she says is the father). And the halachah is in accordance with R. Gamliel in all these cases of our Mishnah. But even so, ab initio, she does not marry into the priesthood (neither the \"speaking\" one [(1:8)] nor the pregnant one) unless most of the men of the city were pedigreed and one of them, who had \"separated\" from the city, had lived with her (for we say: \"All who separate separate from the majority.\" And in that instance, she may marry into the priesthood even ab initio, both she and her daughter.] R.

Nuri said: If the majority of the men of the city (are kasher and their daughters and widows may be) married to the priesthood, she may marry to the priesthood. [Even though one majority is generally sufficient, \"pedigree\" was accorded special status, and in this instance the rabbis required two majorities — the majority of (traveling) companies passing through there (as being pedigreed) and \"the majority of the city.\" Women are not married ab initio to the priesthood without two majorities. And this is the halachah.]"

In the instance of one who was widowed, the heirs say: Our father married you as a widow, and only a manah is owing you] — If there are witnesses that she went out with hinuma [Some say it is a canopy of myrtle that they make for virgins; and others, a veil placed over the eyes, in which one \"slumbers\" (mitnamnemeth)], and her hair were undone, [hanging loose on her shoulders, it being the practice to conduct virgins in this manner from their fathers' house to the wedding hall], her kethubah is two manah. R. Yochanan b. Beroka says: The distribution of parched grain is also evidence (of her being a virgin). [In the locality of R. Yochanan b. Beroka it was the practice to distribute parched grain at the weddings of virgins. And if there were no witnesses that such customs were followed at her marriage and her kethubah were lost, the husband is believed and she claims only a manah.]",
            "\tAnd R. Yehoshua concedes that if one says to his neighbor: This field was your father's and I bought it from him, he is believed, for \"the mouth that forbids is the mouth that permits.\" [Even though above, in the first chapter, re \"If she said: 'After you betrothed me, I was forced,'\" R. Yehoshua differs from R. Gamliel, saying that the woman is not believed in this (even though) she thus forbids herself to the priesthood, when she could have said: I am a mukkath etz and have been permitted to the priesthood — this is so in an instance of \"forbidden\" or \"permitted,\" i.e., to be forbidden to the priesthood or permitted to it. It is in this instance that R. Yehoshua differs from R. Gamliel, saying that she is not believed with a miggo (\"I could have said, etc.\"); but here, where there is no question of forbidden or permitted, but (rather a question of) monetary loss, as when one says to his neighbor: \"This field was your father's and I bought it from him,\" R. Yehoshua concedes to R. Gamliel that in such an instance he is believed with a miggo, having been able to say: \"It is mine,\" so that if he says: \"It was your father's, and I bought it from him,\" he is believed.] And if there are witnesses that it was his father's, and he says: I bought it from him, he is not believed. [The gemara explains that this Mishnah speaks of an instance in which he (the possessor of the field) ate from it only two years before (i.e., in the lifetime of) the father and one year before the son. The Mishnah apprises us that since the three years of chazakah (possession) were not completed in the father's lifetime, the year that he ate before the son does not accrue to the sum of the years of chazakah.",

[Here, too, (they are believed only if they claim that they were) unfit to testify because of kinship; but if because of transgression, they are not believed.] And if there are witnesses that it is their signature or if their signature were corroborated from a different source, they are not believed. [If their signature appeared on a different deed which had been certified in beth-din, and that deed came before us together with this one, and the signatures were alike (they are not believed)].",

[For they testify to their signature, and not to the manah (the amount) of the deed, and each signature requires two witnesses.] These are the words of Rebbi. And the sages say: They need not join another with them, but a man is believed to say: This is my signature. [For they testify to the manah of the deed, and when each says: This is my signature, there are two witnesses for the manah of the deed. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",

If she said: I was taken captive, but I am clean (i.e., I was not forced), she is believed (to marry a Cohein), for \"the mouth that forbids is the mouth that permits.\" And if there are witnesses that she was taken captive, and she says: I am clean, she is not believed. And if after she were married witnesses came, she does not leave. [Not that she had actually been married; but if after she had been permitted to marry, witnesses came and testified that she had been abducted, she does not \"leave\" her first license and she may marry ab initio. But if witnesses came that she had been defiled, even if she had several children, she leaves.]",
            "\tIf two women were taken captive, [i.e., if there are witnesses that they were abducted] — If one says: I was taken captive, but I am clean, and the other says: I was taken captive, but I am clean, they are not believed. And when they testify for each other, [each one saying: My friend is clean], they are believed. [For the sages were lenient in the case of an abducted woman, accepting the testimony of one witness — even a bondsman, even a woman, even a minor \"speaking in his innocence\" — so long as the witness testifies that he had not left her from the time she was taken captive until she had been released by the gentiles.]",
            "\tLikewise, with two men, if one said: I am a Cohein, and the other said: I am a Cohein, they are not believed [to be given terumah]. And when they testify for each other, [each one saying: I and my friend are Cohanim], they are believed.",
            "\tR. Yehudah says: One is not elevated to the priesthood by the testimony of one witness. [Even if there are no \"reciprocal\" witnesses, and, it goes without saying, if there is a possibility of reciprocity, i.e., Testify for me, and I will testify for you.] R. Elazar said: When is this so? Where there are \"objectors\" [who declare him to be unfit for the priesthood; and there is no \"objection\" with fewer than two], but where there are no objectors, one is elevated to the priesthood by the testimony of one witness [where there are no reciprocal witnesses. And this is the difference between R. Elazar and the first tanna (R. Yehudah)]. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says in the name of R. Shimon the son of the sagan (the adjutant high-priest): One is elevated to the priesthood by the testimony of one witness. [The gemara asks: \"Aren't R. Shimon b. Gamliel and R. Elazar saying the same thing!\" And it concludes that they differ on the question of \"combining testimony\" — as when we know that this man's father was held to be a (fit) Cohein, and a report went out that he was the son of a divorcée or of a chalutzah, and he was \"taken down\" (from the priesthood), and then a witness came and said: I know him to be a (fit) Cohein — at which he was re-elevated; and then two witnesses came and said: He is the son of a divorcée or of a chalutzah — at which he was again taken down; and one witness came and said: I know him to be a (fit) Cohein — R. Shimon b. Gamliel says that he is re-elevated to the priesthood by the testimony of this last witness, for we \"combine\" him with the first witness who nullified the report by saying: I know him to be a Cohein. And even though they did not testify at the same time, their testimony is combined, and we say: Set these two who say that he is a Cohein beside the two who say that he is the son of a divorcée, and \"set the man into his (original) status\" (as a fit priest). And according to R. Elazar, he is not re-elevated until two witnesses testify at the same time that he is a (fit) priest. The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel, that the witnesses are combined even though they did not testify together.]",
            "\tIf a woman were imprisoned by gentiles — if because of money, she is permitted to her husband, [for out of fear of losing their money, they will not be wanton with her. And this is so only when Israel has the upper hand over the idolators. In that instance she is permitted to her husband, even if he is a Cohein. (This instance is not similar to that of a captive woman; for in this instance they are afraid of losing their money.) But if the idolators have the upper hand, even (if she were imprisoned) because of money, she is forbidden to her husband if he is a Cohein. And if her husband is an Israelite, she is permitted in any event. For the wife of an Israelite who was forced is permitted to her husband]; if (she were imprisoned) because of \"life,\" [having been sentenced to death], she is forbidden to her husband [even if he were an Israelite; for we fear that she may have cohabited voluntarily with one of them (to save her life).] If karkom (besiegers) captured a city, [the targum of \"matzor\" (siege) is \"karkuma\"], all women married to Cohanim, who are found therein are unfit [forbidden to the priesthood; for the wife of a Cohein is forbidden when she is forced. And if there is in the city one hiding place, where one woman could hide, each of the women of the city is believed to say: I hid in the hiding place and I was not defiled. And since she is believed to say: I hid, she is also believed to say: I did not hide, but I was not defiled.] And if there are witnesses for them — even a bondsman, even a bondswoman — they are believed. And a man is not believed (to testify) for himself. R. Zechariah b. Hakatzav said: [I swear by] \"this abode!\" (the Temple), \"her hand did not leave my hand from the time the gentiles entered Jerusalem until they left\" — whereupon they said to him: \"A man does not testify for himself.\" [and if a man testified about a captive woman that she is clean, he may not marry her if he is a Cohein because of suspicion (of false testimony). And if he redeemed her from captivity with his money, he may testify for her and marry her; for one does not \"throw away\" his money for nothing. If he did not know that she was clean, he would not have given his money for her.]",

A man is believed to say: This is the signature of my father, this is the signature of my rabbi, this is the signature of my brother [and the deed is certified by his word. For the certification of deeds is a rabbinic ordinance, and the rabbis believed him in respect to rabbinical ordinances.], I remember when this woman went out with hinuma (see 2:1) and her hair was undone [in which instance she takes a kethubah of two hundred. And though money is claimed only with bona fide testimony, here it is different; for since most women marry as virgins, it is merely a recounting of events], and (I remember) when this man went from school to immerse to eat terumah [when we were youngsters in school. On the basis of such testimony, he is fed terumah d'rabanan (terumah by rabbinical ordinance), such as terumah which is taken from an unperforated pot, and the like. But he is not fed terumah d'oraitha (terumah by Torah law) by such testimony. And we do not suspect that he might have been the bondsman of a Cohein, for it is forbidden to teach a bondsman Torah.], and (I remember) when he shared (terumah) with us on the threshing floor [And we do not suspect that he might have been the bondsman of a Cohein, for terumah is not distributed to a bondsman unless his master is with him.], and (I remember) that this place was a beth-hapras [If one plows over a grave, he makes a beth-hapras of one hundred cubits, this being the estimated distance that the plow moves the bones of the dead; and the tumah (uncleanliness) of beth-hapras is by rabbinical ordinance.], and we would walk (only) until here on the Sabbath [for (Sabbath) boundaries are a rabbinical ordinance.] But a man is not believed to say: This man had a road in this place, or: this man had ma'amad and misped in this place [i.e., he had a place here to eulogize (lehaspid) his dead, and to make the standings (ma'amadoth) and the sittings that they used to make for the dead. In this, he was not believed, for it is a monetary matter and requires bona fide testimony.]"

With a minor, there is selling, and there is no knass; with a na'arah, there is knass, and there is no selling. With a bogereth, there is neither selling nor knass. [From the age of twelve years, six months and one day and showing two hairs, she is called a \"bogereth.\" Her father cannot sell her and she receives no knass.]",

[For one who admits to knass is exempt from it, it being written (Exodus 22:8): \"Whom the judges incriminate shall pay double\" — to exclude one who incriminates himself.] If one says: I stole, I slaughtered, and I sold, he pays the principal (keren) by his own testimony, but he does not pay the double payment (kefel) and the \"four and five\" payment. (If he says:) My ox killed that man [and I owe kofer (the \"ransom\" payment), he pays by his own testimony, it being held that kofer is monetary payment (and not knass)], or (if he says: My ox killed) that man's ox, he pays by his own testimony.

[The gemara asks: She (the manah woman) should take one third of a manah (a hundred). How does she take fifty, which is half a manah! And it answers that our Mishnah speaks of an instance in which the two manah woman says to the one manah: I shall not contest the manah that is bound to you. Your share shall not be diminished because of me — for which reason she and the three manah woman divide it. And because the two manah woman did not give the one manah woman her share as a gift, but only said to her that she would not contest it with her and that her share would not be diminished because of her — after the one manah woman takes fifty, the rights of the two manah woman remain equal to those of the three manah woman in the remaining manah and a half, and each one takes three golden dinars, which are seventy-five silver dinars, each golden dinar being worth three silver ones.] If there were three manah (of property) [The first manah is bound to all of them; the second to the two manah woman alone], the manah woman takes fifty; the two manah woman, one manah; and the three manah woman, six golden dinars. [This, in an instance in which the three manah woman says to the one and two manah women: I shall not contest the (first) manah with you. Therefore, the first manah is divided between the two manah woman and the one manah woman, so that the one manah woman takes fifty, and the second manah is divided between the two and three manah women. The two manah woman, then, emerges with one manah — the fifty that she took from the division with the one manah woman, and the fifty from the second manah that she took from the division with the three manah woman. And the third manah is taken entirely by the three manah woman, so that she emerges with six golden dinars, which are a manah and a half — the entire third manah which remained for her, and the half-manah from the division with the two manah woman.] Likewise, if three put money into a \"pocket\" (i.e., a joint venture), and it diminished or increased in value, they divide in the same manner. [The gemara concludes that our Mishnah is in accordance with R. Nathan. But it is not the halachah, for Rebbi says: I do not agree with R. Nathan in this, but they all share equally. For since all of his property is bound to the kethubah, all three manah are bound to the one manah woman as they are to the others, until she collects all of her kethubah. Therefore, they share equally, the one manah woman taking as much as the two and three manah women. But with \"three who put money into a pocket\"; one, one manah; a second, two manah; and a third, three manah, in which instance they take in accordance with the appreciation of their money, it is just that each take in accordance with his money (input). And it is only when the money appreciates in and of itself (as when there is a currency change, its value increasing or decreasing) that the profit or loss is distributed according to the money (input itself); but if they bought merchandise with the money they put into the \"pocket,\" and they profited or lost on the merchandise, this profit or loss is divided only according to the number of partners and not according to the money (input) — so that the one who invested little takes as much as the one who invested much, unless they stipulated beforehand to divide in proportion to the investment. And this is how it is adjudged in all of our courts.]",

And, similarly, if the third says thus to the second, and the fourth to the third; but the fourth collects without swearing (in an instance where there is no heir or other creditor to make her swear)]. Ben Naness says: Now should she profit just because she is the last! She, too, collects only if she swears. [The gemara explains the difference between the first tanna and Ben Naness as applying to an instance where one of the fields received by the three first women was found not to belong to him (the husband), it having been discovered to have been stolen, so that in the end the owner will come and claim it. When the fourth woman comes to collect her kethubah from the fourth field, this one (the woman with the stolen field) comes and says to her: The owner of this stolen field is bound to come and take it from me; I want you to swear that you did not collect your kethubah in my husband's lifetime. The first tanna holds that if a later creditor were beforehand in collecting (before an earlier creditor), what he collected is not (validly) collected. Therefore, why should she swear? If the robbed one comes and seizes (his field) from this woman, she will go to the fourth one and take from her what she had collected, the fourth woman being a \"later creditor.\" And Ben Naness holds that if a later creditor were beforehand in collecting, what he collected is (validly) collected, so that if she holds this field, the third woman cannot come to her (and claim it). Therefore, she swears to her that she had collected nothing from her husband's property. The halachah is in accordance with the first tanna. We infer, in any event, that if she seized chattel she must swear according to all, there being no law of precedence vis-à-vis chattel, and what she has collected is (validly) collected.] If all (of the kethuboth) were issued on the same day, if one is even one hour earlier than the other, that woman takes precedence (in collecting).

            "\tIf a widow said: \"I do not want to move from my husband's house,\" the heirs cannot say to her: Go to your father's house and we will feed you; but they must feed her in her husband's house, and they must give her living quarters in keeping with her dignity. [Likewise, vessels, bondsmen, and bondswomen, as she was wont to use in her husband's lifetime. But if the house fell, they are not required to build her another one. For (in the kethubah) it is written: \"And you shall dwell in my house.\" And even if she desired to rebuild it from her own money, she is not heeded.] If she said: \"I do not want to move from my father's house,\" the heirs can say to her: If you are with us, we shall feed you, [the \"blessing\" of the house being greater]; if not, we shall not feed you. If she based her request on her being very young and their being very young, they feed her while she is in her father's house.",
            "\tSo long as she is in her father's house [and the heirs feed her there], she can always [i.e., whenever she wishes] claim her kethubah. So long as she is in her husband's house, she can claim her kethubah for twenty-five years; for there is in the twenty-five years (enough time) for her to do good against (the amount of) her kethubah. These are the words of R. Meir in the name of R. Shimon b. Gamliel. And the sages say: So long as she is in her husband's house, she can always claim her kethubah. So long as she is in her father's house, she can claim her kethubah for twenty-five years. [The twenty-five years were not mentioned to cause her to lose her kethubah because of the good she does from the property of the orphans, but (they were mentioned) in respect to \"waiving\" (the kethubah), i.e., since she remained silent and did not claim it all of these years, she has waived it. Therefore, so long as she is in her husband's house, her silence does not constitute \"waiving,\" for since they honor her, she is ashamed to claim her kethubah. But in her father's house, if she remained silent for twenty-five years, this constitutes \"waiving.\"] If she died, her heirs \"mention\" her kethubah for twenty-five years. [That is, they must claim her kethubah within twenty-five years. And this is only when she swore to (not having collected) her kethubah before she died. But if she had not sworn to her kethubah, her heirs collect nothing of it, for \"a man does not bequeath an oath to his sons.\"]"

            "\tThere were two judges of decrees in Jerusalem, Admon and Chanan ben Avishalom. [They made decrees against robbers and imposed penalties upon them.] Chanan says two things [with which the sages do not concur]; Admon says seven. If one went abroad and his wife claimed food, Chanan says: She swears at the end [When they hear that he died, and she comes to claim her kethubah, she swears that she did not hold back aught belonging to her husband.], and she does not swear at the beginning [when she claims food. Rambam explains: \"She swears at the end\": When her husband comes and denies what she says, saying that he did leave her food, she swears that he had left her nothing.] The sons of the high-priests differed with him, saying that she swears in the beginning and at the end. R. Dossa b. Harkinas ruled in accordance with them. R. Yochanan b. Zakkai said: Chanan said well. She swears only at the end [and the halachah is in accordance with him. And it is only after three months from the husband's going abroad that food is provided for his wife if she claims food; but not before this time. For it is assumed that a man does not go abroad, leaving his house \"empty.\"]",
            "\tIf a man went abroad and one arose and fed his wife, Chanan says: He has lost his money. [For he (the husband) says: I did not say to you: Lend me and I will repay you. But if he lent the woman money for her food on condition that she repay him, he claims it from her, and she claims it from her husband, and he pays. And if the husband claims: I left her food, and she denies it and desires to extract it (payment) from him, the husband swears an oath of equity (shevuath heseth) and exempts himself, and the money (lent her) is a debt to be paid when she is widowed or divorced.] The sons of the high-priests differed with him, saying: He (the lender) swears how much he lent and he takes it (in payment). R. Dossa b. Harkinas ruled in accordance with them. R. Yochanan b. Zakkai said: Chanan said well. He (the lender) placed his money on \"the horn of a deer.\"",
            "\tAdmon says: If one died and left sons and daughters, when the property is ample, the sons inherit and the daughters are fed. And with meagre property [lacking sufficient sustenance for males and females for twelve months (Rambam explains: If there is not enough to feed the sons and daughters until the daughters come of age, it is called \"meagre property.\")], the daughters are fed and the sons go from door to door. Admon says: Because I am a male should I lose! [That is, because I am a male, and fit to inherit ample property, should I be a loser with meagre property!] R. Gamliel said: I subscribe to the words of Admon. [the halachah is not in accordance with Admon.]",
            "\tIf one claims from his friend pitchers of oil, and he admits to [empty ] pitchers, [without oil, as when his friend says: \"You owe me ten pitchers of oil\" ], Admon says: Since he admits to part of the claim, he swears. [The claim connotes oil and pitchers, so that his admitting to empty pitchers constitutes partial admission, which entails an oath. ] And the sages say: This does not constitute admission similar to the nature of the claim. [The claim connotes oil alone in the amount of ten pitchers, so that when he admits to empty pitchers, \"what is claimed is not admitted and what is admitted is not claimed,\" so that there is no admission similar to the nature of the claim, and an oath is not entailed. ] R. Gamliel says: I subscribe to the words of Admon. [The halachah is in accordance with Admon.]",

But now that my father committed himself for me, what can I do? Either marry me or divorce me! R. Gamliel said: I subscribe to the words of Admon. [The halachah is in accordance with Admon.]",

I preferred that it be in your possession to take it from you.] And the sages say: He has lost his right. [For his signing is acknowledgement that he no longer has anything to do with it. The halachah is not in accordance with Admon. And it is only when he is signed as a witness that Admon and the sages differ, but if he is signed as a judge to certify the deed of sale, all agree that he does not lose his right, for he can say: I did not know what is written in the deed. For a judge signed on a certification in endorsement of a deed does not need to know what is written therein, but only to recognize the signatures of the witnesses.] If he made it (acknowledgement of the other's possession of the field) a sign for (the status of) another (field), he loses his right.",
            "\tIf one went abroad, and the road to his field were obscured, [the field-owners on the boundaries having seized it], Admon says: He takes the shortest route. [Against their will he takes a road to his field, but he chooses the shortest possible way, not appropriating more than necessary. And when four men surround him on four sides, Admon admits to the sages that each of them can say: \"Bring proof that the road was through my field, and take it.\" And if one man surrounded him on four sides, the sages admit to Admon that, whatever the case, the road passed through one of his fields. They differ only in an instance of one man coming from the power of (i.e., having bought the respective fields of) four others. Admon says that he can tell him: \"Whatever the case, my road is with you.\"] And the sages say: He must purchase a road for a hundred manah or fly in the air (to get to his field). [The other can say to him: \"If you keep quiet, all good and well; if not, I will return the deed of sale to the respective owners, whom you will not be able to sue!\" The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tIf one presents a bill of payment to his neighbor, and the other presents [a bill of sale, dated after the bill of payment] to the effect that the first sold him his field, [saying (in effect): Your bill (of payment) is a forgery, for if I were indebted to you, you would not have sold me your field, but would have claimed your debt] — Admon says: The second can say: If I were indebted to you, you should have claimed your debt when you sold me the field. And the sages say: This one (the first) was being \"clever,\" selling him the field in order to be able to take it as a pledge (for the debt). [For the second had dispersed his chattel so that the first could not take it as a pledge for his debt, and now he (the first) could take the land. In a place where the buyer pays and then the deed of sale is written, all agree that the seller should have kept the money he received for his debt and not have written the deed. The fact that he did write it, then, is proof that he is not indebted to him. The difference (between Admon and the sages) obtains in a place where they write the deed and then the buyer pays the money. Admon holds that the seller must apprise (others): \"I am selling it to him only to be able to take it as a pledge.\" And the sages say: His not apprising others stems from his apprehension of its getting out and the other not buying the field. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tIf two men presented bills of indebtedness to each other, Admon says: (The one with the bill of the later date can say:) \"If I were indebted to you, how could you borrow from me?\" And the sages say: This one claims his bill of indebtedness, and that one claims his bill of indebtedness. [The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tThere are three lands for marriage. [If a man married a woman in one of them, he cannot compel her to go out after him from land to land]: Judah, Trans-Jordan, and the Galil. One may not take out (his wife) from a city (in one land) to a city (in another), or from a krach to a krach. [A krach is bigger than a city. It is a place of markets; people come to trade there from all around, and all things are found there.] But in the same land, one may take her out from city to city and from krach to krach, but not from city to krach [For it is difficult to dwell in a krach, krachim being highly congested, and the houses pressing upon each other and keeping out the air.], or from krach to city. [For all things are found in a krach, but not a city.] One may take her out from a bad abode to a good one, but not from a good one to a bad one. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Not even from a bad one to a good one, for a good abode \"searches out\" [the body and makes it ill. For \"change of regimen,\" even for the good, is the beginning of intestinal illness. The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel. And if a man from the Galil married a woman from Judah, or the opposite, we compel her to go out with him, for it was on this understanding that he married her. Whatever the case, he takes her out from a city with a majority of idolators to one with a majority of Jews, but not from a city with a majority of Jews to one with a majority of idolators.]",
            "\tAll are brought up to Eretz Yisrael, and none are taken out. All are brought up to Jerusalem [A man may compel all the members of his household to go up with him to Jerusalem. Even if he bought a Hebrew man-servant, he must, perforce, go up with him, even from a good abode to a bad one, and even from a city with a majority of Jews to one with a majority of idolators], and none are taken out, neither men nor women. [If he wishes to go up, and she refuses, she is divorced without a kethubah. And if she wishes to go up, and he refuses, he divorces her and gives her her kethubah.] If he married a woman in Eretz Yisrael and divorced her in Kaputkia, he gives her Eretz Yisrael currency. If he married a woman in Kaputkia and divorced her in Eretz Yisrael, he gives her Eretz Yisrael currency. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: He gives her Kaputkia currency. [Kaputkia is Crete. Its coins are larger and heavier than those of Eretz Yisrael. And because a woman's kethubah is an ordinance of the scribes, they were lenient, allowing it to be paid with the lesser currency. And R. Shimon b. Gamliel holds that a woman's kethubah is Torah-ordained, for which reason he takes the more stringent view. The halachah is not in accordance with him.] If he married a woman in Kaputkia and divorced her in Kaputkia, he gives her Kaputkia currency."
