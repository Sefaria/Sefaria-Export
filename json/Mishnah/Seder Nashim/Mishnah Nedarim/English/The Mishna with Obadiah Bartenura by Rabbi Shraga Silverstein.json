            "\tAll epithets (kinuyei) of vows are like vows. [The gemara explains that the first part of our Mishnah is lacking and that this is what is meant: All yadoth (\"hands\") of vows are like vows; all epithets of vows are like vows. These are yadoth of vows: If one says to his neighbor: \"I am 'bevowed' from you,\" \"I am separate from you,\" etc. These are epithets of vows: \"Konam,\" \"Konach,\" \"Konas,\" etc. \"Hands of vows\": (yadoth) of vows, by which the vows are held. \"Kinyei nedarim\" (\"epithets of vows\"), as in (Bava Metzia 58b) \"hamechaneh shem lechavero\" (\"one who calls his friend by an epithet\", the \"epithet\" (nickname) not being the name per se.] And (epithets) of dedications are like dedications, and (epithets) of oaths are like oaths, and (epithets) of Naziritism are like Naziritism. If one says to his neighbor: \"I am 'bevowed' from you,\" \"I am separate from you,\" \"I am distanced from you,\" \"That I not eat from you,\" \"That I not taste from you,\" he is forbidden (to do so). [If he used one of these expressions: \"I am 'bevowed' from you that I not eat from you and that I not taste from you,\" or: \"I am separate from you that I not eat from you and that I not taste from you,\" or: \"I am distanced from you that I not eat from you and that I not taste from you,\" these are \"yadoth\" (\"hands\") of vows, and he is forbidden to eat and taste from him. But if he said: \"I am 'bevowed' from you\" alone, his words imply only that he will not speak with him. And \"I am separate from you\" alone implies only that he will not deal with him. And \"I am distanced from you\" alone implies only that he will not sit in his four cubits. But he is not forbidden to eat with him unless he specifies with each one of these expressions: \"that I not eat from you and that I not taste from you.\"] (If one said:) \"I am removed (\"menudeh\") from you\" — R. Akiva would compress 'his lips' on this towards stringency, [not wanting to say that it forbade (as a vow), but it being apparent that he held it to do so.] \"As the vows of the wicked, a vow, with Nazirite and with offering, an oath.\" \"As the vows of the upright,\" he has said nothing. [If he said: \"I take it upon myself as the vows of the wicked, whose vows are Nazirite and offering — an oath not to eat this loaf,\" if he transgressed and ate it, he must be a Nazirite for thirty days, and bring a burnt-offering, and he is liable to stripes as one transgressing a vain oath; for he mentioned in his vow \"Nazirite,\" \"offering,\" and \"oath.\" As to his saying: \"As the vows of the wicked,\" this is because it is the wicked who make vows and oaths, not the upright, the upright fearing the transgression of non-fulfillment (of vows) and taking heed not to utter oaths. Therefore, if one says: \"As the vows of the upright,\" he has said nothing.] \"As their gifts, a vow, with Nazirite and with offering.\" [If he said: \"As the gifts of the upright, I shall be a Nazirite, and this shall be an offering if I eat this loaf,\" if he ate it, he is liable to Naziritism and to an offering. For the upright sometimes take a vow of Naziritism to separate themselves from what is forbidden. And they give an offering as a gift, bringing their offering to the entrance of the azarah (the Temple court) and consecrating it there, so as not to go astray through it. The expression for a gift is \"This (object) is\" (a gift), and the expression for a vow \"I take it upon myself,\" for which reason the upright give gifts, but do not vow, so that they not go astray.]",
            "\tIf one says to his neighbor: \"Konam,\" \"Konach,\" \"Konas,\" these are epithets of \"korban\" (offering). [They are gentile expressions, some referring to an offering by one (of these terms); some, by another. With each, he refers to an offering.] \"Cherek,\" \"Cherech,\" \"Cheref\" — these are epithets of \"cherem\" (dedication). \"Nazik,\" \"Naziach,\" \"Paziach\" — these are epithets of \"Neziruth\" (Naziritism). \"Shevutah,\" \"Shekukah,\" (and) if he vowed with \"Mota\" [i.e., if he swore with \"Motah.\" \"Motah\" is an epithet of \"Momta,\" which, in targum, is an oath] — these are epithets for \"shevuah\" (an oath).",
            "\tIf one says: \"Lachullin; I shall not eat from you\" [The \"lamed\" is voweled by a patach, the denotation being: Not chullin (mundane food) shall be what I eat from you, but consecrated food.] \"Not kasher (fit)\" [shall it be, but pasul (unfit), i.e., consecrated food, which is susceptible of \"fitness\" and \"unfitness.\"], \"Not dachi\" [Not permitted, as in (Avodah Zarah 37a): \"Ayal kamtza (a type of locust) dachan\" (\"is permitted\"). And even though the terms \"permitted\" and \"forbidden\" apply also in the context of (animals which are) neveilah (carcass) and treifah (organically defective), and we rule that vows \"take\" only in respect to what is vowed and what is given (and not in respect to something forbidden in itself), since \"permitted\" can also be used in the context of consecrated food, it was taught that with unqualified vows we follow the stringent option. For since he wished the vow to \"take\" here, we say that (in his words) he intended what is vowed (and not what is forbidden in itself)], \"Pure\" [If he said: \"Not pure what I eat from you\"], \"Unclean,\" \"Nothar\" (left-over sacrifices), \"Piggul\" (invalidated sacrifices), it is forbidden. [If he said: \"Unclean, what I eat from you,\" and so, with the others, it is forbidden (to eat from him), for all of these (expressions) apply to consecrated food.] \"As imra\" [As the lamb of sacrifice], \"As dirin\" [the (Temple) wood shed or cattle shed], \"As the fire-offerings,\" As the altar\" [As the offerings upon the altar.], \"As the sanctuary\" [As the offerings of the sanctuary], \"As Jerusalem\" [As the offerings in Jerusalem. Another interpretation: As the walls of Jerusalem (he holds these walls to come from the surplus of the Temple treasury)], If he vowed with any of the altar appurtenances [such as forks, sprinkling bowls, and fire-pans. If he said: \"As the forks, what I eat from you,\" or \"As the sprinkling bowls, what I eat from you,\" and so, with the others], even though he did not say \"Korban\" (\"An offering\"), it is as if he had vowed with \"Korban.\" R. Yehudah says: If one says: \"Jerusalem\" [without the chaf (\"As\")], he has said nothing. [The first tanna differs, and the halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",
            "\tIf one says: \"An offering,\" \"A burnt-offering,\" \"A meal-offering,\" \"A sin-offering,\" \"A thank-offering,\" \"A peace-offering\" (shall be) what I eat from you, it is forbidden (to eat from him). [All of these offerings are obligatory (and a thank-offering, too, is like an obligatory one, for \"Four must give thanks, etc.,\" so that (if we were not apprised otherwise) we might think that this is not called \"vowing with respect to what is vowed.\"] R. Yehudah permits it. [Since he says it without a \"chaf\" (\"As a sin-offering, etc.\"), it is like swearing by the life of the offering and by the life of the burnt-offering, so that neither vow nor oath obtains. The first part of the Mishnah apprises us that the first tanna differs with R. Yehudah even with respect to \"Jerusalem\" if he mentioned it without a chaf, holding it to be a vow. And the second part apprises us that R. Yehudah differs with the first tanna even with respect to \"offering,\" \"burnt-offering,\" and \"meal-offering, etc.\" when he mentions them without a chaf, holding them not to be vows.] \"The offering,\" \"As the offering,\" \"An offering\" that I shall not eat from you — it is forbidden. [Even though all of these were already mentioned, \"The offering\" is necessary; for we might think that he intends thereby \"By the life of the offering\" (i.e., an oath), As to our learning (2:2): \"'The offering that I not eat from you' — it is permitted,\" in that instance he says: \"This offering,\" which connotes \"By the life of the offering.\"] \"Lekorban that I not eat from you,\" R. Meir forbids it. [For it is construed as \"Lekorban yeheh\" (\"Let it be as an offering\"), for which reason I shall not eat from you. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Meir.] If one says to his neighbor: \"konam my mouth that speaks with you,\" \"my hand that does with you,\" \"my foot that walks with you,\" it is forbidden. [Even though vows do not \"take\" with something intangible, and speech is intangible, still, when he says: \"Konam my mouth that speaks with you,\" he constrains the mouth from speaking, and the mouth is tangible. Likewise, let my hands be constrained from doing, and my feet from walking, and the like.]"
        ],
        [
            "\tAnd these are permitted: (Let it be as) \"chullin (non-consecrated food), what I eat from you.\" [(This is simply a sign, viz.: Just as \"Chullin, what I eat from you\" does not require consultation of a sage (for absolution), so all of these mentioned in the first part of our Mishnah do not require consultation of a sage.)], \"As the flesh of pig,\" \"As idolatry,\" \"As the hides of levuvin\" [They would incise the beast around the heart while it was still alive, take out the heart, and offer it to idolatry, and it is not permitted to derive benefit from idolatrous offerings.], \"As neveiloth\" (carcass), \"As treifoth\" (organically defective animals), \"As shekatzim and remasim\" (forbidden animals and reptiles), \"As the challah of Aaron\" [the first of the Cohanim] and as his terumah [Challah is not \"a thing that is vowed,\" challah and terumah not coming through vow and gift.] — these are permitted [For Scripture states (Numbers 30:3): \"A man, if he vow a vow\" — (The forsworn object does not become forbidden to him) unless he vows (to abjure it) against something which is itself vowed (and not forbidden by its very nature). As to (1:4): \"A sin-offering, that I not eat from you,\" which is forbidden, even though it (a sin-offering) is not a thing that is vowed, there (the reason is that) it is possible to make oneself liable for a sin-offering as the result of a vow, as when one takes a Nazirite vow and becomes liable for a sin-offering.] If one says to his wife: \"You are (forbidden) to me as my mother\" [Even though this is not \"something that is vowed,\" it is more stringent than all of those mentioned above, requiring absolution by the rabbis if he is an am ha'aretz (unlearned)], an opening is provided for him from \"elsewhere\" [i.e., an opening and a \"rationale\" is provided for his recantation, it not sufficing that he be asked \"Do you regret it now?\" or \"Do you still feel the same?\" (all this,) so that he not treat the matter lightly (and not become accustomed to forbidding his wife to himself.)] \"Konam\" that I not sleep, that I not speak, that I not walk, [he may not break his word. This, by rabbinical ordinance; for, by Torah law such a vow does not \"take,\" vows taking only with matters of \"substance\"]; if one says to his wife: \"Konem that I not cohabit with you,\" he comes under (Numbers 30:3): \"He may not break his word.\" [The gemara asks: Is he not obliged to (cohabit with) her? How can he release himself from this obligation through his vow? This is comparable to one's forbidding his friend's fruit to his friend! And the gemara answers: (It obtains) when he says: \"The pleasure of cohabiting with you is konam to me,\" where he forbids the pleasure to himself; and a man may not be fed what is forbidden to him.] (If he says;) \"An oath\" that I not sleep, that I not speak, that I not walk — it is forbidden. [It is forbidden by Torah law; for oaths \"take\" both with things of substance and with things lacking substance. And if he swears that he will not sleep three days in a row, day and night, he receives stripes and sleeps immediately, having sworn to do the impossible.]",
            "\t\"Korban, I shall not eat from you,\" \"Korban if I eat from you,\" \"Not korban if I do not eat from you\" — it is permitted. [For it is like swearing by the korban (the offering), i.e., \"By the life of the offering if I eat something from you.\"] \"Shevuah (an oath), I shall not eat from you\" [We do not say that he means: \"By the life of the oath, as we do with \"korban,\" for since an oath has no substance, it is not possible to say: \"By the life of the oath\"], \"Shevuah if I eat from you\" [Sometimes this connotes \"I shall not eat from you.\" As when one importunes his friend to eat, and the other says: \"I shall not eat, I shall not eat,\" adding: \"Shevuah if I eat from you,\" in which instance it connotes: \"I shall not eat from you,\" viz.: \"May I be in transgression of an oath if I eat from you.\"], \"Not shevuah if I do not eat from you\" — it is forbidden. This is a stringency of oaths over vows. [We cannot understand this as referring to \"Shevuah, I shall not eat from you, etc.\" For since we learned: \"This is a stringency, etc.,\" the implication is that a vow obtains, but that it does not have the stringency of an oath. But \"it is permitted\" was taught in respect to \"Korban, I shall not eat from you,\" which is not a vow at all. Therefore, we must understand it as referring to what we learned above (2:1): \"Konam that I not sleep, that I not eat\" comes under \"He may not break his word,\" which was understood as a rabbinic ordinance, a vow not \"taking\" with something lacking in substance. And this is a stringency of oaths over vows; for an oath \"takes\" even with something lacking in substance.] And a stringency of vows over oaths: How so? (If one says:) \"Konam\" if I make a succah, if I take a lulav, if I wear tefillin. With vows it is forbidden; with oaths it is permitted, for there is no oath in transgression of mitzvoth. [For (with oaths) one forbids a thing to himself, so that there is no appearance of vowing to void a mitzvah; for he did not take this upon himself, but (just) forbade the object to himself. So that if he fulfills the mitzvah, it is a mitzvah being performed by means of a transgression. This is similar to one's being obligated to eat matzoh on Pesach night and finding only matzoh of tevel or of hekdesh, which it is forbidden to eat. But with all \"shevuah\" terminology, one forbids himself to do a thing. And since he is commanded to do the mitzvah, he can in no way release himself from this obligation. And if one said: \"A korban upon me if I wear tefillin,\" the vow takes, and he must bring an offering if he wears tefillin.]",
            "\tThere is a vow within a vow, but there is no oath within an oath. How so? If he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite if I eat; I shall be a Nazirite if I eat,\" he is liable for each vow. (If he said:) \"I swear I shall not eat; I swear I shall not eat,\" and he ate, he is liable only for one. [He becomes a Nazirite for thirty days if he said: \"I shall be a Nazirite,\" unqualified. And he brings the Nazirite offering, and again becomes a Nazirite according to the number of times that he vowed. And with an oath, he is liable only for one, receiving stripes only once. But if he gains absolution for the first oath, the second stands. And, similarly, if he gains absolution for the second oath, the third stands; and he is not permitted to eat until he is absolved of all. For we did not learn: \"It is one oath,\" but: \"He is liable only for one.\"]",
            "\tUnqualified vows follow the stringent option, and their qualification, the lenient one. [Even though, when he explains himself, we follow his explanation, if he vows without qualification, we follow the stringent option; for, generally, when one vows, his intent is to forbid.] How so? If one said: \"Let that thing be (forbidden) to me as salted meat,\" [an offering, viz. (Leviticus 2:13): \"With all your offerings shall you offer salt\"], \"as wine libation\" — if he vowed intending (the offering) of Heaven, it is forbidden; if that of idolatry, it is permitted. And if he vowed without qualification, it is forbidden. (If he said:) \"Let it be to me as cherem\" (dedicated property) — If as the cherem of Heaven, it is forbidden; if as the cherem of the Cohanim, it is permitted. [Even though the cherem of Cohanim is subject to mei'lah (abuse of sacred property) before it is taken by the Cohanim, so that it is like \"a thing that is vowed,\" still, \"the cherem of the Cohanim\" unqualified connotes the Cohein's having taken it.] \"Let it be to me as ma'aser\" (the tithe) — If as the tithe of beasts, it is forbidden; and if as that of the threshing floor, it is permitted. [For it (the beast tithe) is as \"something which is vowed,\" for he must dedicate it, and the (non-separation of the) beast tithe does not forbid the cattle shed as the (non-separation of the) grain-tithe forbids the threshing floor.] And if he vowed without qualification, it is forbidden. \"Let it be to me as terumah\" — If as the terumah of the lishkah (the Temple treasury for congregational sacrifices), it is forbidden; and if as that of the threshing floor, it is permitted. And if he vowed without qualification, it is forbidden. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Yehudah says: If he stated \"terumah,\" unqualified, in Judah it is forbidden; in the Galil, it is permitted, for the men of the Galil are not familiar with the terumah of the lishkah [for they were far from Jerusalem.] \"Charamim\" (dedications), unqualified — in Judah they are permitted, and in the Galil, they are forbidden, for the men of the Galil are not familiar with the charamim of the Cohanim [and all of their charamim would go towards bedek habayit (Temple repair). The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",
            "\tIf he vowed by \"cherem,\" and said: \"I intended the 'cherem' (net) of the sea [\"metzodah\" (a net), as in (Koheleth 7:26): \"metzodim vacharamim\"]; by \"korban,\" and he said: \"I intended the korbanoth (gifts) of kings,\"; \"'Atzmi' (generally, \"myself\") korban,\" [If he forbade himself as a \"korban\" to his friend], and he said: \"I only vowed by the bone (etzem) which I had set aside for vowing\" (to deceive others); \"Konam, my wife from deriving benefit from me,\" and he said: \"I intended only my first wife, whom I had divorced\" — with all of these there is no consultation [A sage is not consulted (for absolution), for these vows do not \"take.\"] And if there were consultation [i.e., if such a vow were made by an am ha'aretz, and he came (to a sage) for absolution, he is punished and treated with severity. [He is not granted absolution, and if he transgressed this vow, he is ostracized.] These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say: An opening (for absolution) is opened to them from \"elsewhere,\" and they are taught, so as not to treat vows lightly. [He is shown that the vow takes effect, and they provide him with an opening for absolution from \"elsewhere,\" but they do not punish him and treat him with severity. And this is the halachah.]"
        ],
        [
            "\tThe sages permitted four vows (without absolution): the vows of the diligent, vows of exaggeration, vows of unwittingness, vows of constraint. \"The vows of the diligent\": How so? If one were selling something and said: \"Konam if I sell it to you for less than a sela\" [i.e., This loaf is konam to me if I sell it to you for less than a sela. A sela is four dinars], and the other said: \"Konam, that I shall not give you more than a shekel\" [a half-sela], both acquiesce in three dinars [and they did not intend a formal vow; but the seller \"vowed\" in order to \"spur\" the buyer to pay more, and the buyer, likewise, to get the seller to accept less, for which reason it is not a real vow. And even though \"the heart's thoughts are of no account,\" here, where it is evident that this is their intent, this being the practice of buyers and sellers, we do entertain \"the heart's thoughts.\"] R. Eliezer b. Yaakov says: Also one who wishes to bevow his friend to eat with him. [The gemara explains that something is lacking here and that this is what is meant: If one desires that his friend eat with him, and importunes him, and bevows him, this (too) is (in the category of) \"the vows of the diligent.\" And if one wishes his vows of the entire year not to \"take,\" he should arise on Rosh Hashanah and] say: \"Let every vow that I shall make be void.\" [He need not necessarily do so on Rosh Hashanah, but the same obtains whenever he wishes to do so and for whichever time period he designates] so long as he is conscious [of the condition (that the vow not \"take\")] at the time of the vow, [and he wishes the condition to apply. Only then is the vow void. But if he were not conscious of the condition when he vowed or immediately thereafter, the vow \"takes.\" And it goes without saying that if he were conscious of the condition when he vowed and desired that the condition be void and that the vow \"take,\" it \"takes.\" The laws of oaths and of vows are similar in this regard. The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer b. Yaakov.]",
            "\t\"Vows of exaggeration\" [hyperbole, where he himself knows that it is not so]: If he said: \"Konam, if I did not see on this road as many as left Egypt,\" \"if I did not see a serpent as (thick as) the beam of the olive press.\" \"Vows of unwittingness\": If he said: \"Konam, [this loaf to me] if I have eaten or if I have drunk,\" and he remembered that he had eaten or drunk [and at the time of the vow he thought he had not eaten or drunk, it is no vow.] If he said \"Konam, if I eat or drink (from you),\" and he forgot and ate or drank, (it is no vow) [for at the time when the vow was to have \"taken,\" the time of eating or drinking, he had forgotten the vow, so that it is permitted. This is derived from oaths, where it is written (Leviticus 5:4): \"a man with an oath,\" it being required that he be \"a man\" at the time the oath is to take effect; that is, that he be conscious of the oath. And the same applies to vows.] (If he said:) \"Konam, my wife from benefitting from me because she stole my purse\" or \"because she beat my son,\" and he discovered that she had not stolen it or beaten him, [these are unwitting vows, for discovering that she did not steal it cancels the vow retroactively]. If he saw people eating figs, and he said: \"Let them be forbidden to you as korban,\" and then he found that they (the eaters) were his father and mother, and others with them — Beth Shammai say: They (his parents) are permitted, and those with them, forbidden. And Beth Hillel say: Both are permitted. [For \"a vow that is partially voided is entirely voided,\" the vower desiring that the vow \"take\" as he vowed it; and since part of it was unwitting, it is entirely void.]",
            "\t\"Vows of constraint\": If his friend bevowed him to eat with him, and he took ill, or his son took ill, or he were stopped by an (overflowing) river — these are vows of constraint. [For in the beginning it was not his intent that the vow \"take\" if he be detained perforce; and when the intent is evident, \"the heart's thoughts\" are entertained.]",

[\"haragin\": robbers, who kill men and take their money. \"charamin\": thieves, who do not kill. We are being taught: \"Not only these (i.e., haragin), but even these (i.e., charamin).\" \"mochsin\": This refers to a self-appointed mochess (tax collector), but if he were appointed by the king, whether a king of Israel or a gentile king, and he takes a fixed amount by law of the kingdom, \"The law of the kingdom is the law,\" and it is forbidden to evade the tax, and, it goes without saying, to vow and swear falsely to him. \"that it is terumah\": Even though they kill and steal, they do not eat forbidden food. Or it may be that terumah is not valued by them, being eaten only by Cohanim in a state of cleanliness, so that it is sold cheap.] (And one is permitted to vow) that it belongs to the palace even though it does not belong to the palace. Beth Shammai say: With all (expressions) one may vow, except with an oath. And Beth Hillel say: Even with an oath. Beth Shammai say: He should not open to him with an oath. [If the robber did not ask him to vow, he should not do so of his own accord.] Beth Hillel say: He may even open to him. Beth Shammai say: With what he bevows him. [If the robber asks him to vow, he should vow only with respect to what he was asked and not with respect to something else.] And Beth Hillel say: Even with respect to what he was not asked. How so? If they said to him: Say: \"Konam, my wife from benefitting from me,\" and he said\" \"Konam, my wife and children from benefitting from me,\" Beth Shammai say: His wife is permitted and his children forbidden. And Beth Hillel say: Both are permitted. [With all of these four vows of our Mishnah, the laws of vows and oaths are alike, what is permitted with vows being permitted with oaths.

He redeems them and purchases a korban (an offering) at their worth. For since he did not say: \"They are korban upon me,\" his intent was not to forbid them to himself as a korban, but to purchase a korban at their worth.] (If he said:) \"These plants are korban until they are cut down,\" \"This cloak is korban until it is burned,\" they have no redemption. [But dedication \"takes\" on the (redemption) money, and the plants revert to their status of dedication.

For those who go down to the sea are in the class of those who dwell on the land, [being destined to return and dwell on the land.] Not as those who go from Acco to Yaffo, but to one who sets sail.

For we are speaking of an instance where he does not regret having vowed in the first place.] R. Tzaddok said: Just as they open for him with the honor of his father and mother, let them open for him with honor of the L rd! If so, there can be no vows! [R.

Eliezer said to him: You do not hereby lend us support. For even R. Eliezer would agree that in such an instance he would certainly lie. For no man would be so arrogant as to say that he would not desist (from vowing) for the honor of the L rd. This is not similar to R. Shimon b. Gamliel's providing an opening for a certain man from (Proverbs 12:18): \"One who blurts out (vows), as the piercings of a sword, etc.\" For there he speaks to him (i.e., provides an opening for him) from the verses, as we learned in our Mishnah (9:4), that he transgresses \"You shall not hate,\" \"You shall not take revenge,\" and \"You shall not bear a grudge.\" But if he is confronted with \"the honor of the L rd,\" he certainly will lie. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] And the sages concede to R.

Eliezer stated further [i.e., another lenient ruling in respect to vows]: Nolad [\"what is born\"] can be used as an opening [for vows, i.e., something which is not common, but which might arise and come to pass after the vow has been made. And if the vower had known at the time of the vow that it would come to pass, he would not have vowed.] And the sages forbid it. [For the reason that regret can be used as an opening is that it \"uproots\" the vow from its very inception; but this does not obtain with something which is not common. For not expecting it to occur, he would not have desisted from vowing because of the (mere) possibility of its occurrence.] How so? If he said: \"Konam, that I shall derive no benefit from that man,\" and he became a scribe [a Torah scholar, needed by all], or he married off his son early, and he said; \"Had I known that he would become a scribe or that he would marry off his son so soon, I would not have vowed\" [This, in an instance where he vowed (not to benefit) for a certain time period, and he did not expect the son to be married and to have to attend the wedding within that time period.] (or if he said:) \"Konam, that I shall not enter this house,\" and it was made into a synagogue, (and he said:) \"Had I known that it would be made into a synagogue, I would not have vowed,\" R.

But it is (also) not a bona fide condition, for which reason he requires absolution. In the Yerushalmi it is indicated that he does not require absolution., and Rambam rules accordingly.] If one said: Konam, that I shall not enter this house, for there is a vicious dog in it, or there is a snake in it, and they said to him: The dog died or the snake was killed — these are like nolad and not like nolad.

After she had been brought into R. Yehudah's house and beautified, R. Yishmael asked him: \"My son, was it one such as she from whom you bevowed yourself?\" He answered: \"No,\" and R. Yishmael permitted her. At that time, R. Yishmael cried and said; \"The daughters of Israel are beautiful, but poverty has disfigured them!\" And when R. Yishmael died, the daughters of Israel raised a lament, saying: \"Cry, daughters of Israel, over R. Yishmael\" — as they did when Saul died, viz. (II Samuel 1:24): \"O daughters of Israel, cry over Saul!\" [The gemara explains that something is lacking, and that this is what is meant: \"R. Yishmael says: Even if she were ugly and became beautiful; swarthy, and became fair. And it once happened that a man bevowed himself, etc.\" For the first tanna permits it only if the vow were mistaken from the very beginning, as when she was beautiful to begin with. And R. Yishmael holds that even if she became beautiful only after the vow, it is permitted. For since she can be beautified, she was not ugly to begin with. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yishmael."

If she knows for whom she vowed and for whom she dedicated, her vow is a vow. And she, too — her father and her husband annul her vows.] If the father annulled it, but not the husband; or the husband, but not the father, it is not annulled. [Because we might think that \"her father and her husband annul her vows\" is to be understood as either her father or her husband, we are, therefore, taught: \"If the father annulled it, but not the husband, etc.\", to apprise us that both must annul it.] And it goes without saying that if one of them confirmed it, [the second cannot annul it. We are hereby apprised that even if the one who had confirmed it asked (and gained) absolution for it, (as it is ruled; \"Absolution can be asked for a confirmation\"), the one who asked for absolution can no longer annul it since both of them could not annul it together.]",

In a different respect, the power of the husband is superior to the power of the father. For the husband annuls when she is a bogereth, but the father does not annul when she is a bogereth, [it being written (Ibid. 4): \"…in the house of her father, in her maidenhood.\"]",

And we are apprised by our Mishnah that a husband can annul his wife's vows even without hearing them, it being taught: \"And so the husband, before she enters his domain, says, etc.\"], and so the husband before she enters his domain, says: \"All the vows that you vowed before entering my domain are annulled.\" For when she enters his domain, he cannot annul them.",

And if she is a na'arah and she has a father, her father and the yavam who had made a ma'amar in her annul her vows.] R. Yehoshua says: To one, but not to two. [For R. Yehoshua does not hold a ma'amar to effect bona fide acquisition. However, he does hold that zikkah (\"linkage\") obtains, and that zikkah is like marriage. And when there is only one yavam, he annuls; but if there are two, neither of them annuls, for there is no breirah (retroactive discrimination).] R. Akiva says: Neither to one nor to two. [He holds that zikkah is not like marriage and that ma'amar does not effect bona fide Torah acquisition.] R. Eliezer: Now if a woman whom he acquired for himself [i.e., his betrothed] — if he annuls her vows — a woman bequeathed to him by Heaven [i.e., his yevamah], how much more so should he annul her vows [jointly, with her father]! R Akiva to R. Eliezer: It may be so with a woman whom he acquired for himself, for others have no rights in her! [For she, too, is linked to the other yavmin.] R. Yehoshua to R. Akiva: Akiva, your words (stand to reason) for two yavmin, but what will you say for one yavam! [That is, your answer suffices for the words of R. Eliezer, who says that he annuls even where there are two yavmin. But how will you answer my: \"to one, but not to two\"?] R. Akiva to R. Yehoshua: The yevamah is not absolutely acquired by the yavam [to make one who lives with her liable to the death penalty], as the betrothed is absolutely acquired by her husband [touching this penalty.

Eliezer says: They are annulled. [For as a rule, a man does not desire his wife's vows.] And the sages say: They are not annulled. R. Eliezer said: If he can annul vows which have taken effect [(After she vowed, she is forbidden in them (the objects of her vows) if her husband does not annul them)], should he not be able to annul vows which have not taken effect! They answered: It is written (Numbers 30:14): \"Her husband shall cause it to stand and her husband shall annul it\": What has reached the stage of \"standing\" [i.e., vows which have already taken effect] is subject to annulment; what has not reached the stage of \"standing\" is not subject to annulment.",
            "\tThe annulment of vows [viz. (Numbers 30:9): \"And if on the day that her husband hear, he constrain her\"] obtains the entire day [until it gets dark, it being written: \"on the day that he hear.\" As to its being written (Ibid. 15): \"from day to day,\" this is to apprise us that we are not to say: in the daytime, yes; at night, no. \"from day to day\" indicates that sometimes he has time to annul \"from time to time\" (i.e., a twenty-four hour period), as when she vowed in the beginning of the night.] There is in this a leniency and a stringency. [That is, sometimes there is only little time for annulment, and sometimes, ample time.] How so? If she vowed on Sabbath night, he can annul on Sabbath night and on the day of the Sabbath until it gets dark. If she vowed before it got dark, he can annul (only) until it gets dark. For if it got dark and he had not annulled it, he can no longer do so. [\"Sabbath night\" apprises us that vows may be annulled (mefirin) on the Sabbath, even not for the sake of the Sabbath. But a sage may absolve one of vows (matir) on the Sabbath only for the sake of the Sabbath. And even though he had time in the daytime, he may absolve him for the sake of the Sabbath. (\"For if it got dark and he had not annulled it, etc.\":) For annulment of vows obtains \"from time to time\" only if she had vowed in the beginning of the night. And vis-à-vis annulment (hafarah) it avails only if he says: \"Mufar lach\" (\"It is annulled for you\") as per the language of the verse. For the husband's annulment is from this time forward, as in (Genesis 17:14): \"He has annulled (hefer) My covenant.\" And when a sage says: \"Mutar lach (\"It is absolved for you\"); there is here neither vow nor oath,\" he uproots the vow from its very beginning. And if the sage used the term \"hafarah,\" or the husband, the term \"hatarah,\" there is neither absolution nor annulment. And if he (the husband) said: \"If you did not vow, I bevow you,\" his words stand, and he need not say: \"It stands for you.\" Since, even if he remained silent that entire day the vow would stand, then, with minimal speaking (on his part) it also stands. And on the Sabbath he says: \"Take and eat,\" \"Take and drink,\" and he does not annul as he does on a weekday, and the vow is voided of itself. And if he cannot compel her, he voids it in his heart and he need not utter it with his lips. And it is only with bitul (voiding) such as: \"Take and eat,\" where he forces her to transgress her vow, that thinking in his heart avails, even if he did not utter it with his lips. But with hafarah (annulment), where he does not compel her to transgress her vow, he must utter it with his lips, annulment in the heart not availing.]"

            "\tAnd these are the vows that he annuls [The gemara explains that vows and oaths are intended; for in the language of the sages oaths are included in vows.]: things which entail affliction, viz.: \"If I bathe\" and if \"I shall no bathe,\"; \"If I adorn myself,\" and if \"I shall not adorn myself.\" [i.e., \"The pleasure of bathing is forbidden to me forever if I bathe today\" — this is a vow. \"Shevuah, that I shall not bathe\" — this is an oath. And, similarly, \"if I adorn myself,\" viz.: \"The pleasure of adornment is forbidden to me forever if I adorn myself today.\" \"and if \"I shall not adorn myself,'\" viz.: Shevuah, that I shall not adorn myself.\"] R. Yossi said: These are not vows of affliction. [R. Yossi differs with the first tanna only in respect to vows alone, saying that \"The pleasure of bathing is forbidden to me forever if I bathe today\" is not a vow of affliction; for it is possible for her not to bathe today and the pleasure of bathing not be forbidden to her forever. And a one-day abstinence from bathing is not considered affliction, for a one-day foulness is not considered foulness. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yossi. And both the father and the husband annul vows of affliction, it being written (Numbers 30:17): \"between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter.\" The father is hereby being likened to the husband. Just as the husband annuls only vows of affliction, the father, too, annuls only vows of affliction. And Rambam rules that the father can annul all vows and oaths, even those which are not of affliction, viz. (Ibid. 30:6): \"all of her vows and her bonds.\"]",
            "\tAnd these are vows of affliction: If she said: \"Konam, (that I shall not eat) the fruits of the world,\" he can annul it. (If she said: \"Konam, that I shall not eat) the fruits of that country,\" he can bring her fruits from a different country. \"the fruits of that shopkeeper,\" he cannot annul it. And if his (the husband's) livelihood came only from him (that shopkeeper) [the shopkeeper giving the husband credit until he earned and repaid him], he may annul it. These are the words of R. Yossi. [R. Yossi is consistent with his view that the husband does not annul every vow of affliction, differentiating between great affliction and moderate affliction, and between long-term and short-term affliction. And all of the mishnayoth of this chapter are according to him and are not the halachah. But the husband may annul any vow of affliction, whether a one-day vow, a one-hour vow, or a long-term vow; whether it entails great affliction or moderate affliction. Likewise, he can annul vows and oaths in things \"between him and her\" even though it entails no affliction, as when she swore or vowed not to paint her eyes or not to adorn herself. Likewise, if she vowed not to eat the fruits of this country, the husband can annul it, bringing them from a different country entailing exertion. These are things which are \"between him and her.\" And what is the difference between vows and oaths which are between him and her and vows and oaths of affliction? Vows and oaths of affliction he annuls both for himself and for others, e.g., if she vowed not to eat meat or to drink wine he annuls it and she is permitted to eat and drink, even after she is widowed or divorced and married to another. And vows and oaths \"between him and her,\" e.g., if she forbade to herself cohabitation with all men forever or painting or adorning herself forever, he annuls what pertains to him, and she cohabits with him and paints and adorns herself so long as she is his wife. And when she is widowed or divorced, she is forbidden cohabitation with any man, as well as painting and adornment; and, likewise, in similar instances.]",
            "\t(If she said;) \"konam, that I shall not benefit from people\" he cannot annul it, [this not being a vow of affliction, for she can be fed by her husband, her husband not being included in \"people.\" And this Mishnah, too, is according to R. Yossi and is not the halachah, as explained above. And not only if she says: \"Konam, that I shall not benefit from people, where she forbids herself benefit from all people, can he annul it by reason of \"vows of affliction\" according to the sages; but even if she says: \"Konam, that I shall not benefit from that man,\" where she forbids herself benefit only from that man alone, the husband may annul her vow by reason of \"things between himself and her,\" it involving exertion for him if she does not benefit from that man, and the Torah having stated (Numbers 30:17): \"between a man and his wife\" — Everything \"between a man and his wife\" the husband can annul.] And she can benefit from leket, shikchah, and peah. [This is the intent: Another reason that if she says: \"Konam that I shall not benefit from people,\" the husband cannot annul it is that she can benefit from leket, shikchah, and peah, in which instance she does not benefit from people, these being gifts for the poor, and there is no affliction here.] (If one says: \"Konam,) Cohanim and Levites benefitting from me,\" they may take against his will. [For just as if she said: \"Konam, that I shall not benefit from people,\" she is permitted to take the poor-gifts, here, too. If one bevows Cohanim and Levites from his possessions, they are permitted to take the gifts of the Cohanim and the Levites.] (If he said: \"Konam) these Cohanim and these Levites benefitting from me,\" others may take it.",

[i.e., If she said: \"Hekdesh (\"dedicated\") shall be all of my work from coming to the mouth of my father\"; that is, that my father not be able to benefit from my handiwork, he cannot annul it; for these are not \"things between him and her.\" And in this all agree, that if she forbids others from benefitting from her, her husband cannot annul it.] (If she said: \"Konam,) that I not work for your mouth,\" he need not annul it. [For she is obligated to him. And even though hekdesh dissolves obligations, the sages strengthened her obligation to her husband, the vower not being enabled to dissolve that obligation.] R. Akiva says: He should annul it, for she might earn in addition to what reverts to him [and \"hekdesh\" takes effect upon that addition, it not reverting to him. He must, therefore, annul it; and the annulment is of avail, the vow entailing \"things between him and her,\" it being impossible that the addition not become intermixed with what reverts to her husband.] R. Yochanan b. Nuri says: He should annul it, lest he divorce her and she be forbidden to return to him. [And her basic handiwork requires annulment, lest he divorce her and her obligation to her husband be dissolved, at which point the vow will take effect, and she will be forbidden to return to him. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yochanan b. Nuri. (And we are speaking of an instance where she says: \"Let my hands be hekdesh to their Maker,\" the hands being \"in the world\" (so that she is not vowing in respect to \"something which is not in the world\"), and hekdesh \"takes\" upon them.]",

[For annulment in error is not annulment. He must (in his annulment) intend the woman who vowed, it being written (Numbers 30:12): \"He did not constrain her\" — the annulment must be directed to the vower herself. And he must also intend the specific vow which was uttered, it being written (Ibid. 5): \"…and her father hear her vow\" — he must know which vow she vowed.]",

If he annulled it for figs, it is not annulled until he also annuls it for grapes.

But \"yeferenu\" (\"He shall annul it\") cannot be expounded thus, so that there is no annulment until he annuls all of it. This is an individual opinion and is not the halachah, the halachah being in accordance with the sages, who say: Causing to stand is likened to annulment, viz.: Just as with annulment, what he annulled is annulled, and what he did not annul is not annulled (it not being possible to expound \"yeferenu\" as partial annulment), so with causing to stand. What he caused to stand, stands; and what he did not cause to stand, does not stand. (For \"yekimmenu\" is also not expounded as partial confirmation, it being the way of Scripture to write it thus.) And even though re the absolution (hatarah) of a sage, we say: \"If one is absolved of part of a vow he is absolved of all of it,\" with the annulment of the husband and the father, it is not so.] If she said: \"Konam, that I shall not taste figs and that I shall not taste grapes,\" these are two vows.",

Meir says: He may not annul it. [For since he knew that he could annul it, even though he did not know it was a vow, he should have annulled it in any event. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Meir.] The sages say: He may annul it.",

It must refer, then, to an instance where she had been widowed for some time and the time of the vow (i.e., of its taking effect) did not arrive until after she we married. (\"He cannot annul it\":) even though the vow takes effect when she is married to him; for the time of vowing is the criterion (for annulment).] If she vowed while she were in her husband's domain, he annuls it for her (even if it is to take effect afterwards.) How so? If she said: \"I shall be a Nazirite after thirty days,\" even if she were widowed or divorced within thirty days, it is annulled. If she vowed on one day, and were divorced on that day, and taken back on that day, [after which he heard of her vow], he cannot annul it [since she entered her own domain between the vow and the annulment, the husband not being empowered to annul prior vows.] This is the rule: If a woman enters her own domain for (even) one moment, he (her husband) cannot annul it (a prior vow).",

And even though we say (Kethuvoth 71a) that if she vowed (not to cohabit) she goes out without a kethubah, for \"she placed her finger between her teeth,\" Rashi explains (Yevamoth 112a) that since she forbids to herself cohabitation with all of Israel, she must certainly be doing so perforce, intercourse being painful for her.
