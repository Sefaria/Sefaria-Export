            "When an individual takes a vow, he renders an object forbidden to himself or to others as though it were a sacrificial offering; this parallels the act of consecrating an offering, which also renders an item forbidden for personal use by means of a verbal declaration. The most direct expression of a vow is when an individual says: This object is forbidden to me, or to others, like an offering. Additionally, the mishna states that <b>all substitutes</b> for the language <b>of vows are like vows.</b> Consequently, if one states that an object is forbidden to him like a <i>konam</i> instead of like an offering [<i>korban</i>], the vow takes effect, as <i>konam</i> is a substitute term for the word <i>korban</i> (see 10a). Similarly, substitutes for the language of <b>dedications are like dedications,</b> substitutes for the language of <b>oaths are like oaths, and</b> substitutes for the language of <b>nazirite</b> vows <b>are like nazirite</b> vows. Therefore, if one declared a <i>ḥerekh</i> instead of a dedication [<i>ḥerem</i>], a <i>shevuta</i> instead of an oath [<i>shevua</i>], or proclaimed that he was becoming a <i>nazik</i> instead of a nazirite [<i>nazir</i>], his statement takes effect. With regard to <b>one who says to another: I am avowed from you,</b> or: <b>I am separated from you,</b> or: <b>I am distanced from you,</b> and he then says: <b>That</b> which <b>I eat</b> of <b>yours,</b> or: <b>That</b> which <b>I taste</b> of <b>yours,</b> even though he did not explicitly state that he is taking a vow or specify the nature of the vow, the object of his vow is nevertheless <b>forbidden.</b> His intention is understood based on his incomplete statement, known as an intimation of a vow, and his vow therefore takes effect. However, if he says: <b>I am ostracized from you,</b> which does not clearly declare any matter to be prohibited, <b>Rabbi Akiva was uncertain</b> about this <i>halakha</i> but was inclined <b>to rule stringently about this</b> and consider it a vow prohibiting the speaker from deriving benefit from his fellow. The mishna continues to explain the rules of intimations of vows. If an individual states that he accepts an obligation upon himself <b>like the vows of the wicked, he has vowed with regard to</b> becoming <b>a nazirite, or</b> bringing <b>an offering, or</b> taking <b>an oath.</b> This is considered a real formulation of a vow, just as the wicked customarily take vows. If he says: <b>Like the vows of the virtuous, he has not said anything,</b> because virtuous people do not generally take vows. If he says: <b>Like their gift offerings, he has vowed with regard to</b> becoming <b>a nazirite or</b> bringing <b>an offering.</b>",
            "In the case of <b>one who says to another</b> that a certain object is <b><i>konam</i>, <i>konaḥ</i>,</b> or <b><i>konas</i>, these</b> expressions <b>are substitutes</b> for the term <b>offering [<i>korban</i>],</b> and the vow takes effect. <b><i>Ḥerek</i>, <i>ḥerekh</i></b> and <b><i>ḥeref</i>; these are substitutes</b> for the term indicating a <b>dedication [<i>ḥerem</i>]</b> to the Temple treasury. <b><i>Nazik</i>, <i>naziaḥ</i>,</b> and <b><i>paziaḥ</i>; these are substitutes</b> for the term <b>naziriteship [<i>nazir</i>]. <i>Shevuta</i>, <i>shekuka</i>,</b> or one who <b>vows with</b> the term <b><i>mota</i>, these are substitutes</b> for the term <b>oath [<i>shevua</i>].</b>",
            "<b>If one says</b> to another: <b>That which I eat of yours</b> shall be considered <b><i>laḥullin</i>,</b> it is interpreted as though he said: <i>La ḥullin</i>, not non-sacred, and the food is thereby forbidden to him. Similarly, if he said that food shall be considered <b>not valid</b> or <b>not <i>dekhi</i>,</b> i.e., not <b>ritually pure, or</b> if he said the food shall be considered an offering that has become <b>ritually impure, left over [<i>notar</i>], or <i>piggul</i>,</b> i.e., an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its appointed time, <b>it is forbidden.</b> If one says that food shall be considered <b>like the lamb</b> of the daily offering, <b>like the</b> animals designated as offerings and kept in special <b>enclosures, like the wood</b> of the altar, <b>like the fires</b> on the altar, <b>like the altar, like the Sanctuary,</b> or <b>like Jerusalem,</b> or if <b>he took a vow with any of the accessories of the altar, although he did not</b> explicitly <b>mention</b> that the food should be like <b>an offering, it is</b> considered <b>a vow</b> that associates a different item with <b>an offering. Rabbi Yehuda says: One who says</b> that an item shall be considered <b>Jerusalem,</b> instead of saying that it shall be considered like Jerusalem, <b>has not said anything.</b>",
            "With regard to <b>one who says: An offering, a burnt-offering, a meal-offering, a sin-offering, a thanks-offering,</b> or <b>a peace-offering,</b> and adds: <b>That which I eat of yours,</b> the vow takes effect and the food <b>is forbidden. Rabbi Yehuda renders</b> the food <b>permitted</b> in all these cases. If one says: <b>The offering, like an offering,</b> or <b>an offering,</b> and adds: <b>That which I will eat of yours,</b> the food <b>is forbidden.</b> If he says: That which <b>I will not eat of your</b> shall be <b>for an offering, Rabbi Meir renders</b> the food <b>forbidden.</b> <b>One who says to another:</b> It is <b><i>konam</i></b> for me for <b>my mouth</b> to <b>speak with you,</b> or: It is <i>konam</i> for me for <b>my hand</b> to <b>work with you,</b> or: It is <i>konam</i> for me for <b>my foot</b> to <b>walk with you, it is prohibited</b> for him to speak with, work with, or walk with the other individual."
        ],
        [
            "<b>And these are</b> the vows in which the one who takes the vow attempts to create a prohibition on an item by associating it with an item in an ineffective manner, rendering the vow void and leaving the item <b>permitted:</b> If one says: <b>That which I will eat of yours</b> will be <b>non-sacred [<i>ḥullin</i>];</b> or: That which I will eat of yours will be <b>like pig meat;</b> or: <b>Like</b> an object of <b>idol worship;</b> or: <b>Like</b> the <b>hides</b> of animal offerings <b>whose hearts were removed</b> as a form of idol worship, and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from those animals; or: <b>Like animal carcasses and animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>];</b> or: <b>Like</b> non-kosher <b>repugnant creatures and</b> non-kosher <b>creeping animals;</b> or: <b>Like the <i>ḥalla</i> of Aaron,</b> the first priest, <b>or like his <i>teruma</i>;</b> in all these cases, the food is <b>permitted.</b> Although none of these items may be eaten, they are forbidden by Torah law, not by means of a vow. Therefore, it is impossible to extend their prohibition to other items by means of a vow that associates them with those items. With regard to a man <b>who says to his wife: You are hereby to me like</b> my <b>mother,</b> i.e., deriving benefit from you should be forbidden to me like engaging in sexual intercourse with my mother, dissolution <b>is broached with him by</b> suggesting <b>a different extenuation,</b> i.e., a halakhic authority suggests other, extenuating circumstances that enable the dissolution of the vow. Although this vow does not take effect either, as engaging in sexual intercourse with one’s mother is prohibited by Torah law, by rabbinic law this is treated like an actual vow and requires dissolution by a halakhic authority, so <b>that he will not</b> take genuine vows <b>lightly.</b> With regard to one who says: <b>Sleeping is</b> forbidden <b>for me as if</b> it were <b>an offering [<i>konam</i>],</b> thereby prohibiting himself from sleeping; or: <b>Speaking is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me;</b> or: <b>Walking is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me;</b> or <b>one who says to his wife: Engaging in sexual intercourse with you is <i>konam</i> for me,</b> if he violates the vow <b>he is in</b> violation of the prohibition <b>“He shall not profane his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3). If one says: I take <b>an oath that I will not sleep,</b> or: <b>That I will not speak,</b> or: <b>That I will not walk,</b> this activity is <b>prohibited</b> to him. ",
            "As taught earlier (10a), one of the primary methods of taking a vow is by invoking an offering. The mishna provides several examples where invoking the term <i>korban</i> is not effective. If one says: <b>An offering [<i>korban</i>] that I will not eat of yours,</b> or: <b>This offering [<i>ha korban</i>] that I will eat of yours,</b> or: That which <b>I will not eat of yours</b> is <b>not an offering [<i>la korban</i>],</b> the food is <b>permitted.</b> If one says: <b>An oath</b> that <b>I will not eat of yours,</b> or: <b>This</b> is <b>an oath that I will eat of yours [<i>she’okhal lekha</i>],</b> or: <b>Not an oath that I will not eat of yours,</b> the food <b>is forbidden.</b> <b>This</b> rule, that oaths can render actions, which do not have actual substance, either prohibited or obligatory, <b>is a stringency of oaths vis-à-vis vows,</b> which do not take effect with regard to matters that do not have actual substance. <b>And</b> there is also <b>a stringency of vows vis-à-vis oaths. How so?</b> With regard to one who <b>said: Making a <i>sukka</i> is <i>konam</i> for me,</b> or: <b>Taking a <i>lulav</i> is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me,</b> or: <b>Donning phylacteries is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me, in</b> the case of <b>vows,</b> the items are rendered <b>forbidden,</b> and he may not perform the mitzva until the vow is dissolved. However, <b>in</b> the case of similar <b>oaths,</b> these items are <b>permitted, as one cannot take an oath to transgress the mitzvot.</b>",
            "<b>There is a vow within a vow.</b> It is possible to impose an additional prohibition, by means of a vow, on an item that is already forbidden by means of a vow. <b>But there is no oath within an oath.</b> If one takes an oath twice with regard to the same action, the second oath does not take effect. <b>How so?</b> If one <b>said: I am hereby a nazirite if I eat,</b> and then repeated: <b>I am hereby a nazirite if I eat, and</b> then <b>he ate, he is obligated</b> to observe naziriteship for thirty days <b>for each and every one</b> of the vows, as both vows took effect. However, if he said: I hereby take <b>an oath that I will not eat,</b> and repeated: I hereby take <b>an oath that I will not eat, and</b> then <b>he ate, he is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for only one</b> violation of an oath.",
            "<b>Unspecified vows</b> are treated <b>stringently, but their specification,</b> if specification is necessary, is treated <b>leniently. How so?</b> If one <b>said: This</b> item is prohibited <b>to me like salted meat,</b> or: This item is prohibited to me <b>like</b> the <b>wine</b> used for <b>libations, if he vowed in reference to</b> meat or libations <b>of a peace-offering,</b> i.e., if he claimed that his intention was that the item will be forbidden to him like the salted meat of an offering, or like wine that is used for libations on the altar, it is <b>forbidden,</b> as he associated the item of the vow with an item forbidden by means of a vow, i.e., the offering. <b>If</b> he claims that <b>he vowed in reference to</b> meat or libations <b>of idol worship,</b> i.e., that the item will be like the salted meat of an offering for an idol, or like wine that is used for libations as idol worship, it is <b>permitted,</b> as the item of the vow was associated with an item forbidden by the Torah. By enabling the one who took the vow to later clarify his intent, the vow is treated leniently. <b>And if</b> the vow was <b>without specification,</b> i.e., the one who took the vow did not specify whether his intention was to associate the item with an offering for Heaven or to associate the item with idol worship, it is <b>forbidden.</b> Similarly, if one said: <b>This</b> item is <b>hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me</b> like an item dedicated to the Temple, <b>if</b> his intention was that it would be <b>like a dedication to Heaven,</b> which is a form of consecration, <b>it is forbidden. And if</b> his intention was that it would be <b>like a dedication to priests,</b> whereby one pledges his asset as a gift to priests, <b>it is permitted,</b> as this type of gift is not forbidden at all. <b>And if</b> he said it <b>without specification,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b> Likewise, if he said: <b>This</b> item <b>is hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me like tithes, if he took a vow</b> with the intention that it would be <b>like the animal tithe,</b> it is <b>forbidden,</b> as the item of the vow was associated with an item forbidden by a vow. <b>And if</b> his intention was that it will be like the tithe <b>of the granary,</b> i.e., grain that is given to the Levites and has no sanctity, it is <b>permitted. And if</b> he said it <b>without specification,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b> Similarly, if he said: <b>This</b> item <b>is hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me like <i>teruma</i>, if he took a vow</b> with the intention that it would be <b>like the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber [<i>terumat halishka</i>],</b> which is a tax for the communal offerings, it is <b>forbidden,</b> his vow was associated with an item forbidden by a vow. <b>And if</b> his intention was that it would be like <i>teruma</i> <b>of the granary</b> that is given to the priests, it is <b>permitted,</b> as <i>teruma</i> is not an item forbidden by a vow. <b>And if</b> the vow was taken <b>without specification,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Unspecified <i>teruma</i> in Judea is forbidden.</b> However, <b>in the Galilee it is permitted, as the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with the collection of the chamber.</b> When they say <i>teruma</i> they are referring to the <i>teruma</i> allotted to the priests, which is familiar to them. Conversely, <b>unspecified dedications in Judea are permitted,</b> but <b>in the Galilee they are forbidden, as the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with dedications</b> allotted <b>to the priests,</b> so when they say dedication they are referring to dedication to Heaven.",
            "One who <b>took a vow</b> by associating an item <b>with a dedication [<i>ḥerem</i>],</b> saying: This item is hereby forbidden to me like an item dedicated to the Temple, <b>and</b> then <b>said: I took a vow only with</b> the intention that it would be like <b>a sea net [<i>ḥermo shel yam</i>]</b> that is used to catch fish; or one who took a vow by associating an item <b>with an offering, and</b> then <b>said: I took a vow only with</b> reference to <b>offerings to kings,</b> i.e., a gift for a king, not an offering to God. Or one who said: <b>I am hereby an offering myself [<i>atzmi</i>], and</b> then <b>said: I took a vow only with</b> reference to <b>a bone [<i>etzem</i>] that I set aside for myself to vow with,</b> as <i>atzmi</i> means both myself and my bone, i.e., he set aside a bone so as to pretend to take a vow upon himself; or one who said: <b>Deriving benefit from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife, and</b> then <b>said: I took a vow only with regard to my first wife whom I divorced,</b> not with regard to my current wife. <b>For all</b> of the above vows, those who took them <b>do not</b> need to <b>request</b> of a halakhic authority to dissolve <b>them,</b> as the speaker interpreted the vows in a manner that caused them not to take effect at all. <b>However, if they requested</b> dissolution, apparently due to their being uncertain of their explanations, the court <b>punishes them and treats them stringently</b> and the vows are not dissolved. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> These vows are not treated stringently. Rather, dissolution <b>is broached with them by</b> suggesting <b>a different extenuation,</b> i.e., the halakhic authority suggests extenuating circumstances that undermine the vow but do not pertain to its wording. <b>And we teach them</b> that they should not take this kind of vow in the future, <b>in order that they will not take vows lightly.</b>"

            "<b>The Sages dissolved four</b> types of <b>vows</b> without the requirement of a request to a halakhic authority: <b>Vows of exhortation, vows of exaggeration, vows that are unintentional, and vows</b> whose fulfillment is impeded by <b>circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control.</b> The mishna explains: <b>Vows of exhortation</b> are those by which one encourages another using vow terminology that is exaggerated. <b>How so? One was selling an item and said: I will not lower</b> the price <b>for you</b> to less <b>than a <i>sela</i>,</b> as <b>that is <i>konam</i>,</b> forbidden <b>as if</b> it were <b>an offering,</b> for me. <b>And the other one,</b> the buyer, <b>says: I will not raise</b> my payment <b>to you</b> to <b>more than a shekel,</b> as <b>that is <i>konam</i></b> for me. In this case, one may assume that <b>both want</b> to complete the deal <b>at three dinars,</b> and they did not intend to vow but only exaggerated for purposes of bargaining. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Even one who wants to take a vow</b> prohibiting <b>another</b> from benefiting from him, but only in order <b>that he should eat with him,</b> not intending to take an actual vow, <b>should say to him</b> at the outset: <b>Any vow that I take in the future is void. And</b> this statement is effective, <b>provided that he remembers at the time of the vow</b> that his intent at the beginning of the year was to render it void.",
            "<b>Vows of exaggeration</b> that the Sages dissolved without a request to a halakhic authority, as described in the first mishna in the chapter, include the following examples. If <b>one said</b> concerning a certain item: It is <b><i>konam</i></b> for me <b>if I did not see on this road</b> as many people <b>as those who ascended</b> from <b>Egypt,</b> or if he said: It is <i>konam</i> for me <b>if I did not see a snake</b> as large <b>as</b> the <b>beam of an olive press,</b> in these cases the speaker did not intend to vow but used hyperbole to demonstrate a point, and it is understood by others that the expression is not to be taken literally. What are examples of <b>vows that are unintentional</b> that are dissolved, as taught at the beginning of the chapter? One who vows: This loaf is forbidden to me as if it were an offering [<i>konam</i>] <b>if I ate or if I drank, and</b> then <b>he remembers that he ate or drank.</b> Or, one who vows: This loaf is <i>konam</i> for me if <b>I</b> will <b>eat or</b> if <b>I</b> will <b>drink, and he</b> then <b>forgets and eats or drinks.</b> Also, <b>one</b> who <b>said: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife because she stole my purse or she hit my son, and</b> then <b>it became known that she had not hit him or it became known that she had not stolen.</b> The mishna lists another example of an unintentional vow: <b>One</b> who <b>saw</b> people entering his courtyard and <b>eating figs, and</b> because he did not want them to do so <b>he said:</b> The figs are forbidden <b>to you</b> like <b>an offering. And</b> then <b>it was found</b> that <b>his father and brother</b> were in the group, <b>and there were others with them</b> as well, and certainly he did not intend to take a vow prohibiting his father and brother from eating the figs. In such a case, <b>Beit Shammai says: They,</b> his father and brother, <b>are permitted</b> to eat the figs, <b>and those</b> others <b>that were with them are prohibited</b> from doing so. <b>And Beit Hillel says:</b> Both <b>these and those are permitted</b> to eat the figs, as will be clarified in the Gemara.",
            "What are examples of <b>vows</b> impeded by <b>circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control?</b> If <b>one’s friend took a vow with regard to him that he should eat with him, and he became sick, or his son became sick, or a river</b> that he was unable to cross <b>barred him</b> from coming, <b>these are</b> examples of <b>vows</b> whose fulfillment are impeded by <b>circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control.</b> They are not binding and do not require dissolution.",
            "<b>One may take a vow to murderers,</b> i.e., people suspected of killing others over monetary matters; <b>or to robbers [<i>ḥaramin</i>]; or to tax collectors</b> who wish to collect tax, <b>that</b> the produce in his possession <b>is <i>teruma</i> although it is not <i>teruma</i>.</b> One may also take a vow to them <b>that</b> the produce in his possession <b>belongs to the house of the king, although it does not belong to the house of the king.</b> One may take a false vow to save himself or his possessions, as a statement of this sort does not have the status of a vow. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may vow</b> in such a case, although he has no intention that his words be true, <b>using every</b> means of taking a vow or making a prohibition in order to mislead those people, <b>except for by</b> taking of <b>an oath,</b> due to its more stringent nature. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may mislead them <b>even by</b> taking <b>an oath.</b> <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> When negotiating with a robber, <b>one should not initiate by</b> taking <b>a vow for him</b> unless the robber does not believe his claim, in which case he may take a vow to reinforce his words. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may even initiate</b> by taking a vow <b>to him. Beit Shammai say:</b> One may take a vow only <b>about that which</b> the robber <b>compels him to take a vow</b> but may not add to it. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may take a vow <b>even about that which he does not compel him to take a vow.</b> The mishna explains the previous statement: <b>How</b> so? If the extortionist <b>said to him</b> that he should <b>say: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife</b> if the vow is not true, <b>and he said: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife and my children, Beit Shammai say: His wife is permitted</b> to benefit from him, since the extortionist demanded that he take that vow, <b>but his children,</b> whom he added of his own accord, <b>are prohibited</b> from benefiting from their father. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Both these and those are permitted</b> to benefit from him.",

In addition, <b>they are subject to</b> the possibility of <b>redemption</b> just as other items consecrated for maintenance of the Temple may be redeemed.

These verses indicate that ordinary gentiles are referred to as uncircumcised, regardless of whether they are actually circumcised. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: The foreskin is repulsive, as</b> is evident from the fact that <b>the wicked are disgraced through it, as it is stated:</b> “Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision: Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair polled, that dwell in the wilderness; <b>for all the nations are uncircumcised,</b> but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart” (Jeremiah 9:25), which indicates that there is an element of disgrace associated with the foreskin. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> So <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that thirteen covenants were sealed with regard to it,</b> for the word covenant appears thirteen times in the biblical passage that discusses circumcision (Genesis, chapter 17). <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> So <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that it overrides the strict</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat,</b> as circumcision is performed even if the eighth day following the birth of a son occurs on Shabbat, despite the fact that circumcision violates the prohibition of labor on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision,</b> as is evident from the fact <b>that</b> the punishment of <b>Moses the righteous for</b> not circumcising his son when he was capable of doing so <b>was not postponed</b> for even <b>a full hour</b> (see Exodus 4:24–26). <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> So <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that it overrides</b> the prohibitions associated with <b>leprosy.</b> If leprosy is found on the foreskin of an infant, although it is generally prohibited to cut the afflicted area, it is permitted to do so to perform the mitzva of circumcision. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> So <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that</b> despite <b>all the mitzvot that Abraham our Patriarch did,</b> he <b>was not called wholehearted until he circumcised</b> himself, <b>as it is stated</b> at the time that the mitzva was given to him: <b>“Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1). <b>Alternatively,</b> so <b>great is</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision that if not for it the Holy One, Blessed be He, would not have created His world, as it is stated: “Thus says the Lord: If My covenant be not with day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25), and the covenant that exists day and night is the covenant of circumcision, as it is always found on the person’s body."

The Gemara relates: <b>And an incident</b> occurred <b>with regard to one who vowed</b> against deriving <b>benefit from the daughter of his sister,</b> as he did not wish to marry her. <b>And they brought her into</b> the <b>house of Rabbi Yishmael and he beautified her.</b> When she was later brought before the one who took the vow, <b>Rabbi Yishmael said to him: My son, did you vow</b> that you would not derive benefit <b>from this</b> woman? <b>He said to him: No, and Rabbi Yishmael permitted her</b> to him, as he demonstrated that the vow had been made in error. <b>At that time Rabbi Yishmael wept and said: The daughters of Israel are beautiful, but poverty makes them ugly. And when Rabbi Yishmael died, the daughters of Israel raised a lamentation, saying: Daughters of Israel, weep for Rabbi Yishmael. And it likewise states about Saul,</b> who also concerned himself with the welfare of the daughters of Israel: <b>“Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,</b> who clothed you in scarlet with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel” (II Samuel 1:24)."

            "With regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband</b> together <b>nullify her vows.</b> If <b>the father nullified</b> her vow <b>and the husband did not nullify</b> it, or if <b>the husband nullified</b> it <b>and the father did not nullify</b> it, then the vow <b>is not nullified. And needless to say,</b> it is not nullified <b>if one of them ratified</b> the vow.",
            "If <b>the father</b> of a betrothed young woman <b>dies,</b> his <b>authority does not revert to the husband,</b> and the husband cannot nullify the young woman’s vows by himself. However, if <b>the husband dies,</b> his <b>authority reverts to the father,</b> who can now nullify her vows on his own. <b>In this</b> matter, <b>the power of the father is enhanced relative to the power of the husband.</b> <b>In another matter, the power of the husband is enhanced relative to the power of the father, as the husband nullifies</b> vows <b>during</b> the woman’s <b>adulthood,</b> once they are fully married, <b>whereas the father does not nullify</b> her vows <b>during</b> her <b>adulthood.</b>",
            "If <b>she took a vow as a betrothed woman</b> and then <b>was divorced on the same day,</b> and <b>she was</b> again <b>betrothed on the same day</b> to another man, or <b>even to one hundred</b> men, one after the other, on a single day, <b>her father and her last husband nullify her vows.

            "<b>The practice of Torah scholars</b> is to ensure that a woman about to be married should not be encumbered by any vows. A father, <b>before his daughter would leave him</b> through marriage, <b>would say to her: All vows that you vowed in my house are hereby nullified. And similarly, the husband, before she would enter his jurisdiction,</b> i.e., while they were still betrothed, <b>would say to her: All vows that you vowed before you entered my jurisdiction are hereby nullified.</b> This was necessary <b>because once she enters his jurisdiction he cannot nullify</b> the vows she made before that.",
            "With regard to <b>a grown woman who waited twelve months</b> after her betrothal and the time arrived for her betrothed to marry her, <b>or a widow</b> who waited <b>thirty days</b> and the time arrived for her betrothed to marry her, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Since her husband is</b> already <b>obligated</b> to provide <b>for her sustenance,</b> as he is obligated to have married her by then, <b>he can nullify</b> her vows by himself, as if he were fully married to her. <b>But the Rabbis say: The husband does not nullify</b> her vows on his own <b>until she enters his jurisdiction.</b>",
            "With regard to <b>a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage, <b>whether</b> she is waiting <b>for one <i>yavam</i>,</b> if her late husband had only one brother, or <b>whether</b> she is waiting <b>for two</b> or more <b><i>yevamin</i>,</b> if he had several brothers, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> A <i>yavam</i> <b>can nullify</b> her vows. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> If she is waiting <b>for one</b> <i>yavam</i>, he can nullify her vows, <b>but not</b> if she is waiting <b>for two. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> A <i>yavam</i> <b>cannot</b> nullify her vows, regardless of whether she is waiting <b>for one</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>or for two</b> or more. The mishna then elaborates: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a woman he acquired for himself</b> through betrothal, <b>he nullifies her vows,</b> so too with regard to <b>a woman acquired for him from Heaven,</b> i.e., the <i>yevama</i>, <b>isn’t it logical that he should</b> be able to <b>nullify her vows?</b> <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: No, if you say</b> that a husband can nullify the vows of <b>a woman he acquired for himself, over whom others have no authority, shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case with regard to <b>a woman acquired for him from Heaven, over whom others have authority?</b> If there are two <i>yevamin</i>, each <i>yavam</i> has equal authority with regard to her vows. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: Akiva, your statement applies</b> in a situation <b>with two <i>yevamin</i>,</b> but <b>how do you reply</b> to Rabbi Eliezer <b>in</b> the case of <b>one <i>yavam</i>?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: A <i>yevama</i> is not the full-fledged</b> wife <b>of the <i>yavam</i> in the in the way that a betrothed woman</b> is <b>her husband’s full-fledged</b> wife, and the <i>yavam</i> is not empowered to nullify vows at all.",
            "<b>One who says to his wife: All vows that you will vow from now until I arrive from such and such a place are hereby ratified, has not said anything,</b> i.e., the vows are not ratified. However, if he states that all vows that she will take until then <b>are hereby nullified, Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> They are <b>nullified, while the Rabbis say:</b> They are <b>not nullified. Rabbi Eliezer said</b> in explanation: <b>If one can nullify vows that have reached the status of a prohibition,</b> i.e., that have already taken effect, <b>shall he not</b> be able to <b>nullify vows that have not reached the status of a prohibition?</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him</b> in response: The verse <b>states:</b> “Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, <b>her husband may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it”</b> (Numbers 30:14). This teaches: <b>That which has reached the status of</b> eligibility for <b>ratification,</b> i.e., a vow that she has already taken, <b>has reached the status of</b> eligibility for <b>nullification.</b> However, a vow that <b>has not reached the status of</b> eligibility for <b>ratification</b> has <b>not reached the status of</b> eligibility for <b>nullification</b> either, and it cannot be nullified.",
            "The <b>nullification of vows</b> can be performed <b>all day</b> on the day on which the vow was heard. <b>There is in this matter</b> both <b>a leniency,</b> extending the nullification period, <b>and a stricture,</b> curtailing that period. <b>How so?</b> If a woman <b>took a vow on Shabbat evening,</b> her father or husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow <b>on Shabbat evening, and on Shabbat day until dark.</b> This is an example of extending the nullification period. However, if <b>she took a vow with nightfall</b> approaching, her father or husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow only <b>until nightfall, since, if it became dark and he had not</b> yet <b>nullified</b> her vow, <b>he cannot nullify</b> it anymore.

            "<b>And these are</b> the <b>vows that he,</b> the husband or father, <b>can nullify:</b> The first category consists of <b>matters that involve affliction</b> for the woman who took the vow. For example, if a woman vowed: <b>If I bathe, or: If I do not bathe;</b> if she vowed: <b>If I adorn myself [<i>etkashet</i>], or: If I do not adorn myself.</b> <b>Rabbi Yosei said: These are not vows of affliction. </b>",
            "Rather, these are vows of affliction: For example, if <b>she said: The produce of the</b> entire <b>world is <i>konam</i> for me as if</b> it were <b>an offering, he can nullify</b> the vow, as it certainly involves affliction. If, however, she said: <b>The produce of this country is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me,</b> he cannot nullify the vow, as it does not involve affliction, since <b>he may</b> still <b>bring her</b> produce <b>from another country.</b> Similarly, if she said: <b>The produce of this storekeeper is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me, he cannot nullify</b> her vow, as he may still bring her produce from another storekeeper. <b>But if</b> he can obtain <b>his sustenance only from him,</b> that particular storekeeper, <b>he can nullify</b> the vow.

            "If a woman vowed: The property <b>of</b> other <b>people is <i>konam</i></b> for me, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I will</b> not <b>benefit</b> from it, her husband <b>cannot nullify</b> her vow, <b>but</b> nevertheless, if she is poor, <b>she may benefit from</b> the agricultural gifts that must be left for the poor: <b>Gleanings,</b> i.e., isolated stalks that fell during the harvest; <b>forgotten</b> sheaves; <b>and produce of the corners [<i>pe’a</i>]</b> of the field that the owner is obligated to leave for the poor. Enjoyment of these gifts is not considered as benefit derived from people, as these gifts are not given voluntarily out of the kindness of the donors, but in the performance of a mitzva. If one said: I will not let <b>priests</b> and <b>Levites benefit from me,</b> as that is <b><i>konam</i></b> for me, <b>they can take</b> the priestly and Levitical gifts from him <b>against his will.</b> If, however, he said: I will not let <b>these</b> specific <b>priests and these</b> specific <b>Levites benefit from me,</b> as that is <i>konam</i> for me, they are <b>taken by others.</b>",

If she does more than the fixed amount of work that a woman is obligated to perform for her husband, the vow will be valid with respect to the excess to which he is not entitled, and he might inadvertently come to benefit from something that is forbidden to him. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri</b> also <b>says</b> that he <b>should nullify</b> the vow, but for a different reason: <b>Perhaps he will</b> one day <b>divorce her,</b> at which point the vow will take effect <b>and she will</b> then <b>be forbidden to him</b> forever, i.e., he will be unable to remarry her, lest he come to benefit from her labor.",
