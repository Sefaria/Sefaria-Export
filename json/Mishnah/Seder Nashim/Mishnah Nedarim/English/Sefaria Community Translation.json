            "There are four [types of] vows that the sages invalidated, [and these four types are]: vows of encouragement, vows of exaggeration, vows made in error, and vows made against one's will. A vow of incitement: how [does this manifest itself]? If a merchant said, \"<i>konam</i> that I will not sell to you for less than a <i>sela</i>\" and the buyer says, \"<i>konam</i> that I will not pay more than a shekel.\"  [These vows are invalid since] both agree on three dinars. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov says: Even a vow made by one who wants to compel his friend to eat with him [by making a vow], and says [beforehand], \"All vows that I will make in the future - they are nullified,\" this statement is effective [and his future vow is null], as long as he remembers [the statement] at the time he vows.",
            "Vows of exaggeration: [for example,] if someone said: \"<i>konam</i> if I did not see on this path [a quantity of people similar to] those who left Egypt!” [six hundred thousand males], [or “<i>konam</i>] if I didn’t see a snake [as large] as the beam of an olive press!\" Vows made in error: [an example might be if someone said: \"<i>konam</i>] if I ate and drank\", but then remembered that he did [in fact] eat or drink. [Or if one said: \"<i>konam</i>] if I will eat or if I will drink,\" (thereby obligating himself to fast), [but then he] forgot, and ate or drank. [Similarly, if one said:] \"<i>konam</i> if my wife benefits from me, because she stole my purse or because she hit my son,\" [but then] it becomes known that she did not [really] beat him, [or] it becomes known that she did not [really] steal [her husband's purse] , [it is a vow made in error]. If someone saw [in the distance, some people] eating [his] figs, and says: \"[let those figs] be to you like a <i>korban</i>,\"  but [he finds out that the men in the distance were] his father and his brothers. [If] others were with them, Beit Shammai says: [the father and brothers are] permitted [to eat the figs], but [the people] with them are forbidden. But Beit Hillel says: both [his relatives and the others] are permitted [to eat the figs].",
            "Vows made against one's will: [An example of this might be] if someone subjected his friend to a vow that [the friend] will eat with him, but [the friend] became sick or [the friend's] son became sick, or a river [rose and] prevented him [from traveling safely] - these are vows made against one's will.",
            "One may vow [in front of] murderers and thieves and [royal] tax collectors that [something] is <i>terumah</i>, even if it isn't <i>terumah</i>; [or] that they are property of the king, even if they aren't property of the king. Beit Shammai says: [this is true] regarding all vows except for oaths, and Beit Hillel says: even regarding oaths. Beit Shammai says: he [the victim] may not offer to make the vow. And Beit Hillel says: he may even offer [to make the vow]. Beit Shammai says: [he may only vow] regarding what he is asked to vow, and Beit Hillel says: even regarding that which he wasn't asked to vow. How so? If they [the murderers, thieves or tax collectors] order him to say: \"<i>konam</i> that my wife may not benefit from me [if this is not <i>terumah</i>, etc.],\"' but he says \"<i>konam</i> that neither my wife nor my children may benefit from me\" - Beit Shammai says: his wife is permitted to him but his children are forbidden, and Beit Hillel says: both are permitted.",

[But if one vows:] \"these saplings are [forbidden to me like a] <i>korban</i>, until they are uprooted,\" [or] \"this garment is [forbidden to me like a] <i>korban</i>, until it is burned,\" - there is no redemption for [these items].",

[This law not only applies] to those [sailors] that travel [the short distance] from Acre to Jaffa, but even to those who normally separate [for longer periods of time].  ",

[One who vows: \"<i>konam</i>] that Jews won't benefit from me,\" must buy at a lower price and sell at a higher price [than usual], as long as there are any Jews who would heed him [in his offer]. [One who vows: \"<i>konam</i>] that they won't benefit from me, nor I from them,\" may benefit from Gentiles. [One who vows:]\"<i>konam</i> that I won't benefit from the uncircumcised,\" is permitted [to benefit from] uncircumcised Jews but forbidden to [benefit from] circumcised Gentiles. [One who vows:] \"<i>konam</i>  that I won't benefit from the circumcised\" is prohibited [to benefit] from uncircumcised Jews and permitted [to benefit] from circumcised Gentiles. [This is] because [the term] '<i>orla</i>' [foreskin] is only used in reference to Gentiles, as it is written: (Jeremiah 9:25) \"Because all the nations are <i>arelim</i> [uncircumcised], but all the house of Israel are of uncircumcised heart,\" and it says: (I Samuel 17:36) \"and this <i>arel</i> Philistine,\" and it says: (II Samuel 1:20) \"Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the <i>arelim</i> triumph\". Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah says: \"Disgusting is the foreskin, [since] the wicked are insulted through it, as it says: 'because all the nations are uncircumcised'\". Rabbi Yishmael says: \"Great is circumcision, for thirteen covenants were sealed concerning it\". Rabbi Yose says: \"Great is circumcision, that it overrules the strict [prohibitions of] Shabbat.\" Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha says: \"Great is circumcision, for Moses the righteous wasn't given a moment [to allow his son to remain uncircumcised]. Rabbi Nechemiah says: \"Great is circumcision, for it overrules [the prohibitions of] <i>nega'im</i> [impure afflictions].\" Rabbi says: \"Great is circumcision, for [despite] all the commandments that Abraham did, he was not called 'complete' until he was circumcised, as it says: (Genesis 17:1) 'Walk before Me and be complete'\". Another saying [of his]: \"Great is circumcision, for but for it, the Holy One would not have have created His world, as it says: (Jeremiah 33:25) \"Thus says the Lord, 'If my covenant is not established day and night, the laws of the heavens and earth I will not set.'\"  "

But he may not feed his animal, whether it be kosher or non-kosher. Rabbi Eliezer says: \"He may feed his non-kosher [animal] but he may not feed his kosher [animal]\".
