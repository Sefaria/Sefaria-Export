            "It is necessary that a messenger who, from a foreign country, brings a Get [from a husband to his wife], should declare, \"This document was written and signed in my presence.\" Rabbon Gamaliel saith, \"[It is necessary that this declaration should be made] even [when it was brought] from [the villages] Rakam and Chagar.\" R. Eleazar saith, \"Even from the village of the Luddites to Lud [Lydda].\" But the sages hold, \"That only when a person brings a Get from a place beyond sea, or carries it thither, that he is bound to declare, 'It was written and signed in my presence.' And the same must be declared by a messenger who, in a country beyond sea, brings a Get from one province to another.\" Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, \"Also by one who only brings it from one lordship [jurisdiction] to another [jurisdiction].\"", 
            "R. Jehudah [considers as beyond the limits of Palestine] from Rakam and beyond [Rakam included] all places towards the east, from Ascalon and beyond [including that place] every part towards the south. From Acco and beyond [Acco included] every place towards the north. But R. Meir is of opinion \"That Acco must, in respect to Get, be considered as an integral part of the Holy Land.\"", 
            "Whoever brings a Get within the limits of the Holy Land, need not declare, \"It was written and signed before me,\" but if any demur is made, its validity must be proved by the signatures [of the attesting witnesses]. Should a messenger bring a Get from a place beyond sea, and is not able to testify that it was written and signed in his presence, its validity must be proved by the signatures of the attesting witnesses.", 
            "Both Gittin of women and deeds of manumission for slaves, are alike in respect to the person who brings them from, or carries them to [a distant country], and this is one of the points in which the laws respecting Gittin and deeds of manumission are alike.", 
            "All legal documents, on which the attestation of a Samaritan witness appears, are void, Gittin and deeds of manumission excepted. It once happened that a Get was brought to Rabbon Gamaliel in the village Otnay, which was attested by Samaritans, which he nevertheless declared to be a valid instrument. All legal documents made in courts of justice of non-Israelites are valid, even when the attesting witnesses are not Israelites, Gittin and deeds of manumission excepted. R. Simeon declares these also to be valid, the contrary was only mentioned to apply to the case when they were prepared in an extra judicial manner.", 
            "When a person says, \"Give this Get to my wife, or this deed of manumission to my slave,\" he can, if he repents of his purpose, take it back. Such is the dictum of R. Meir, but the sages hold \"That this is only allowable with a Get, and not with a deed of manumission, because it is permitted to confer advantages on a person in his absence, but not to deprive him of any advantage, except in his presence; for, if a person refuses to maintain his slave, he may do so, but he may not refuse maintenance to his wife.\" He [R. Meir] thus argued to them: \"Does he not surely disqualify both his slave and wife from the right of eating heave?\" But they [the sages] replied, \"It is because the slave is the priest's property [and is considered in the same light as his cattle] that he has a right to eat of the heave.\" Should a person say, \"Give this Get to my wife, and this deed of manumission to my slave,\" and dies [before it was delivered], they may not be delivered to the parties mentioned after his decease; but if he said, \"You are to give a maneh to A.B.,\" and dies, that money must be paid [to the legatee]."

            "When a person who brings a Get from a foreign country declares, \"It was written, but not signed in my presence,\" or the reverse, or, \"The whole [Get] was written, but only in part attested in my presence,\" or, \"Only half of the writing [of the Get] but the whole of the signatures were written in my presence,\" it is void. Also in case one [witness] says, \"It was written,\" and another, \"It was signed in my presence.\" When two say, \"It was written in our presence,\" and one, \"It was signed in my presence,\" it is also void. But R. Jehudah declares it valid. When one declares, \"It was written in my presence,\" and two declare \"It was signed in our presence,\" it is valid.", 
            "If it were both written and signed in the day time,  or that both writing and signatures were done at night, or that it was written at night, but signed by day, it is valid. If it were written by day, but signed at night, it is void, but R. Simeon declares it valid; for he established it as a rule \"That all documents written by day and signed at night are void, except letters of divorce.\"", 
            "The writing of a Get may be done with any material, with ink, paint, ruddle, gum, or with vitriol black, and with every other indelible material, but not with any liquor, the juice of fruit, nor with any delible material. It may be written on any thing, even on a leaf of an olive tree or on a cow's horn. In the latter case, however, the husband is bound to give her [the wife] the cow along with it. He may write it on the hand of a slave, but then he must give her the slave also; but R. José prohibits the writing of a Get on any thing endowed with life, or on edible articles.", 
            "A Get may not be written on any thing that is yet attached or fixed to the soil. If it was so written, and it was afterwards severed from the soil, and then signed and delivered to the woman, it is valid. But R. Jehudah declares it void, for it must be written and signed on what is detached from the soil. R. Jehudah ben Beterah saith, \"It must not be written on papyrus, on which an erasure or abrasion appears, nor on unfinished vellum, because it affords opportunity for falsification;\" but the sages permit it.", 
            "All are qualified to write a Get, even deaf and dumb, or foolish persons and minors. A woman may write her own Get, and the husband his acquittance [for the amount of the Ketubah he has paid her], because the validity of legal documents depends solely on the signature of the attesting witnesses. All are qualified [to act as missionaries or agents] to bring over a Get, except deaf and dumb or foolish persons, minors, a blind person, and a non-Israelite.", 
            "When a minor received [a commission to deliver] a Get and became of age [before he delivered it], or a deaf person whilst in that state, and who afterwards recovered his hearing, or a blind person who subsequently recovered his sight, or a demented person, who was afterwards cured, or a non-Israelite,  who subsequently became a proselyte, the Get is void. But when a person received it whilst in possession of his faculty of hearing, and before he delivered he became deaf, and again recovered his hearing, or a person who could see, had become blind, and again recovered his sight, or a person of sound mind who had become demented, and was cured: the Get is valid, because the rule is, that when the commencement and end of the act took place, whilst the person was in possession of his faculties, it is valid.", 
            "Those females who are not considered competent witnesses to testify to a woman in respect to the decease of her husband, are to be credited when [as messengers] they bring over a Get to her, viz., her mother-in-law, the daughter of her mother-in-law, her rival, the wife of her husband's brother, and her husband's daughter. Why is this difference in respect to the evidence as to a Get, or as to the death of a husband? Because there is [in the first mentioned case] a document in existence to confirm the evidence. A woman may bring her own Get with her, but she must declare at the same time, \"It was written and signed in my presence.\""

        [
            "Every Get which is not expressly written for the woman about to be divorced is void; as for instance, if a person passing through a street hears the voice of public notaries [dictating to their clerks or pupils], saying, \"A.B. divorces C.D., his wife, living at the place E.,\" to which he remarked, \"That is the same name as mine and that of my wife\" [and he gave that Get to the latter], it is void. More rigid than this is, that even when he had ordered a Get to be written for him, to divorce his wife, and afterwards changed his mind, and was met by a fellow townsman, who told him, \"My name and that of my wife are exactly the same as yours and that of your wife [give it me therefore to divorce my wife],\" the latter may not use it for that purpose. More rigid than this is, that if a man had two wives, whose names are similar, and a Get was written to divorce the elder, he may not use it to divorce the younger. More rigid than this is, that when a man says to a notary, \"Write a Get, that I may therewith divorce one of my two wives,\" he may not use it [for either].", 
            "[Public] writers of blank forms of Gittin [bills of divorce] must leave sufficient space for the insertion of the names of the husband and wife, and for the date. In blank forms of loan contracts sufficient space must be left for the insertion of the lender's name and that of the borrower, the sum lent, and the date. In forms of deeds of sale, space must be left sufficient for the insertion of the names of buyer and seller, the purchase money, [the description of] the field [sold], and the date. This institution [of allowing blank forms to be made by notaries, to be filled up when required] was made for the convenience of public writers. R. Jehudah, however, declares all such written [and afterwards filled up] blank forms void; but R. Eleazar considers them valid, with the exception of a Get, or act of divorce, because it is written in the Law (Deut. xxv.), \"He shall write unto her a bill of divorce,\" i.e., on purpose for her.", 
            "If a messenger entrusted with a Get loses it, if he finds it again immediately it is still valid, but not otherwise. If he found it in a pocket or bag [or in any other place], if he identifies it the Get is valid. When a messenger brings a Get from a husband who was aged, or from one he left very ill, he may deliver it on the presumption that the husband is still alive. Thus may an Israelitess whose husband [a priest] went beyond seas, eat of the heave offering on the presumption of her husband being alive. Also, when a person abroad sends a sin offering [to the Temple], it is to be sacrificed, on the presumption of the sender being alive.", 
            "The three following dictums of R. Eleazar ben Partah, were confirmed by the sages; viz., \"That the existence may be presumed of persons who were known to be in a besieged town, or on board of a vessel in a storm, and of an accused person who was led before a tribunal to be judged [in a criminal case], but that in respect to persons living in a town which was taken by assault, or in a vessel that became a wreck, and a malefactor who was led forth to be executed, the laws relating to the living and the dead are to be applied to them in their utmost rigidity.\" An Israelitess married to a priest, or a priest's daughter married to an Israelite, may not [under the last mentioned circumstances] eat heave.", 
            "A person who [in the Holy Land] brings a Get from one place to another, and falls ill on the road, may send it further on to its destination by another messenger; but, if the husband had said, \"Bring me also from her this or that [valuable] article,\" he may not send it by another; because the husband trusted him, but would not [perhaps] have trusted the agent.", 
            "When a person who brings a Get from beyond sea, falls ill on the road, he may empower the Beth Din to nominate another messenger for him, to carry the Get to the person it was intended for: and the first messenger must testify before them, that the Get was written and signed in his presence: the second messenger is not bound to make any such declaration, but need only say, \"I am a messenger of the tribunal.\"", 
            "When a person lends money to a priest, or to a Levite, or to a poor person, on condition that he may deduct from the debt the tithe or oblation due from him to them, he may do so, in the presumption that they are then alive; neither need he apprehend that the priest or Levite should have died, or the poor man have become rich; but if they died [before the debt was paid] he must obtain the consent of their heirs [to make this deduction], but this is unnecessary if the money was lent in presence of the Beth Din.", 
            "A person who puts fruit aside to separate from them heave and tithe [due of other fruit], or money to redeem the second tithe [of his fruit], may do so, in the presumption, that the fruit or money set apart is in actual existence; but if the fruit was lost, he must always calculate [in paying the tithe] the quantity [of fruit] which existed twenty-four hours [before the discovery of the loss]. Such is the dictum of R. Eleazar ben Shamuang; R. Jehudah saith, \"When wine was separated for such a purpose, it must be examined at three periods [of the year], viz. when the eastern winds begin to blow after the Feast of Tabernacles, when the fruit of the grape vine has set, and when the unripe grapes begin to be juicy.\""

            "If a man sends a bill of divorce to his wife via a messenger, and then catches up with the messenger, or sends another messenger after the first to say to the first messenger, \"the bill of divorce that I gave to you is cancelled,\" then the bill of divorce is cancelled.  If the husband beats the messenger to the woman's home, or sends a second messenger who beats the first there, and says to her \"the bill of divorce that I sent you is cancelled,\" then it is cancelled.  From the moment that the bill of divorce reaches the woman's hands, it can no longer be cancelled.", 
            "At first, a man [who had already sent his wife a bill of divorce by means of a messenger] would set up a religious court in a different place [from where the wife lived] and cancel the bill of divorce.  Rabban Gamliel the Elder established that this should not be done, for the sake of the repair of the world.  At first, a man could use a different name for himself, his wife, his city, or her city.  [That is, a man could use a nickname on the bill of divorce.]  Rabban Gamliel the Elder established that one should write one's name and any other name that he has and her name and any other name that she has for the sake of the repair of the world.", 
            "A widow may only collect [the debt owed from her Ketubah] from the property of orphans if she swears an oath [Shavua]. They stopped swearing, so Rabban Gamliel the Elder instituted that she may promise [Neder] whatever they desire, and she can then collect her Ketubah. \nWitnesses sign on a Get, because of societal concerns [Tikkun Olam]. \nHillel instituted the Pruzbol because of societal concerns [Tikkun Olam]", 
            "A slave that was kidnapped and then ransomed, if [he was ransomed] in order to be a slave, he becomes a slave. If [he was ransomed] to be a free man, he does not become a slave. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: In both cases, he becomes a slave [nevertheless]. A slave whose master mortgaged him to others, and then frees him, the baseline law is that the slave is not obligated at all [to be a slave to the person he was mortgaged to]. But as a community service, they force his [second master] to [also] free him, and [the slave is forced to] write a [debt] document for his money's worth to him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: [The slave] does not write [a debt document], but only a [document of] freedom.", 
            "One who is half [Canaanite] slave and half free-man, serves his master every other day and serves himself every other day. These are the worlds of Beit Hillel. Beit Shamai said to them: You have repaired it for his master, but not repaired it for him! To marry a slave-girl is impossible ([i.e. forbidden), for he is half-free. [To marry] a free woman is impossible, for he is half-slave! And was not the world created for the sake of reproduction, as it says (Is. 45:18) \"Not for emptiness did He create it, but for settlement He formed it.\" Rather, for the sake of repairing the world, we force his master and he makes [the half-slave] into a free-man, and writes a writ [of release] for half his value. Beit Hillel retracted (their statement) and ruled according to the words of Beit Shamai.", 
            "Someone who sells his slave to a non-Jew or to someone outside the land of Israel, [the slave automatically] goes free. We do not ransom captives for more than they are worth, for the sake of the community. We do not help captives escape, for the sake of the community. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: [Not for the sake of the community, but] for the sake of the captives. We do not buy religious books, tefillin, and mezuzot from the non-Jews for more than their worth, for the sake of the community.", 
            "If someone divorced his wife because of her bad reputation, he may not remarry her. If it was because [she made a] vow, he may not remarry her. Rabbi Yehuda says: If the vow was known to the public, he may not remarry her. If it was not known to the public, he may remarry her. Rabbi Meir says: Any vow that required the inspection of a rabbi [to determine if it can be annulled], he may not remarry her. If it does not require inspection of a rabbi, he may remarry her. Rabbi Eliezer says: This was only forbidden for that [i.e. both prohibited a remarriage]. Rabbi Yossi b'Rabbi Yehuda said: There was an occurrence in Tzidan, where one man had said to his wife, \"I swear [in the form of a konam swear] if I do not divorce you, and he divorced her. The rabbis allowed them to remarry, for the sake of the community.", 
            "If someone divorces his wife because she is incapable of having children [an ilonit], Rabbi Yehuda says: He may not remarry her. The Rabbis say: He may remarry her. She marries someone else, and she had children with that man, and she sues for her ketuba [from the first, on the basis that she is in fact capable of having children], Rabbi Yehuda says: We tell her, \"The less you say, the better, [because then your first husband can claim the divorce was under false pretenses, rendering your current children as mamzerim].\"",

            "They cannot be levied from mortgaged property,  while there is yet uncharged property to levy from, although that should be the least valuable. The payment of claims against the estate of orphans, can only be enforced by the sale of their least valuable property.", 
            "Payment for usufructum, for the improvement of the land, or for the maintenance of a wife and her daughters [of a former marriage], is not to be levied from mortgaged property. All this was ordered for the maintenance of social order, and an oath is not to be imposed on a finder for the same reason.", 
            "When the estate of orphans is administered by the father of a family, or that the father of the orphans had nominated a person as guardian to them, these persons so acting are bound to tithe the fruit belonging to the orphans. A guardian nominated by the father of the orphans, must swear to his due administration of the estate; but one appointed by the tribunal is not bound to do so. But Abbah Saul says, \"It is just the reverse.\" When a person had caused fruit belonging to another to become [legally] unclean, or mixes them with heave, or his wine with other wine used for idolatrous libations; if he did it inadvertently, he is absolved from paying for the damage he has caused; but if he did it wilfully, he is liable. Priests who wilfully render sacrifices ‏פיגול‎ [unacceptable], are bound to make good the damage [to the owner].",

            "The right of Sicaricon did not prevail in Judea during the war, but it did afterwards; as for instance: When an Israelite bought a field from a Sicaricon [forcible intruder], and afterwards from the rightful owner, the bargain is void; but it is effective if he bought it first of the rightful owner, and then of the Sicaricon. When a person bought a field from a husband, and then of his wife, the bargain is void; but if he bought it first of the wife, and subsequently from the husband, it is effective. Such was the first decision. But a subsequent tribunal decided, that a person who bought a field from a Sicaricon must pay a fourth part of the price paid for the purchase to the rightful owner of the field. This is when it is not in the power of the latter to repurchase his field; but when that is the case, the rightful owners are to be preferred to any one. Ribi constituted a Beth Din, which decided that a field which had remained for a twelvemonth in the power of a forcible intruder [Sicaricon] may be sold to any one, but the purchaser must pay a fourth part to the former rightful owner.", 
            "A deaf and dumb person may enter into engagements by contract, by means of mutual signs [between the contracting parties]. Ben Beterah saith, \"Where the contract affects moveable property only, the mutual motion of the lips suffices.\" When children have arrived at the age of discernment, their purchase or sale of moveable property stands good.", 
            "The following ordinances were made for the sake of promoting of peace: That a Cohen should read first in the Holy Law, then a Levite, and an Israelite afterwards, for the sake of peace; the Erub must be placed in the same house in a court where it had always been put, for the sake of peace; the well nearest to the water-course must be filled first, for the sake of peace. Taking out of nets or traps belonging to other people, [any animal, bird, or fish] therein caught, was made constructive felony, in order to preserve peace. R. José saith, \"It is a real felony.\" What a deaf and dumb or foolish person or minor finds [is his own], and the taking it from him was made a constructive felony, for the preservation of peace. R. José saith, \"It is a real felony.\" It was also ordained, in the case of a poor person beating down olives from the top of a tree, that the fruit so dropped is his property, and whoever takes it from him will be considered guilty of a constructive felony.

The wife of a ‏חבר‎ (i.e. one learned in, and observant of, the law] may lend to the wife of an unlearned person, a flour-sieve or a winnow, and may aid her to winnow, to grind, or to sift; but as soon as water is poured over the flour, she may not further assist her, for those who transgress the law are not to be aided in their transgressions. All the mentioned permissions have been granted for the sake of peace only.

Therefore, should a husband say to the messenger, \"I do not wish that you should receive it for her [as her messenger], but go and give it her [as my messenger],\" he may, if he likes, resume it again. Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, \"Also, when the wife said, 'Fetch me my Get,' the husband cannot take it back.\"",

A betrothed girl may either receive her Get herself, or her father may receive it for her. R.

            "When a female minor said, \"Receive my Get for me,\" the Get is ineffective until it has reached her hands. Therefore, should the husband wish to revoke the Get, he is at liberty to do so, because a minor has not the power of appointing a messenger [or deputy]; but if her father said [to the messenger], \"Go and receive my daughter's Get,\" the husband cannot revoke it. When a husband says, [paragraph continues] \"Give this Get to my wife in the place N. N.\" and the messenger gave it her elsewhere, the Get is void.

When a woman says, \"Receive for me my Get in such a place,\" and the messenger received it for her in another place, it is void; but R. Eleazar declares it valid. If she said, \"Bring me my Get from such a place,\" and he fetched it from elsewhere, it is valid.",

When she said to a messenger, \"Receive my Get for me,\" she may not, from that instant, eat any longer of the heave. If she said, \"Receive my Get for me, and bring it to the place N.

If he said, \"Release her,\" or, \"Provide her her maintenance,\" or, \"Do with her as is customary,\" or, \"Do with her as is proper,\" what he has said amounts to nothing. Formerly, it was held that when a criminal was led out with an iron collar [to the place of execution], and he said, \"Write a Get for my wife,\" they should write it, and deliver it to her.

When a person in health says, \"Write a Get for my wife,\" he must be considered as if joking with her. It once happened that a person in health said, \"Write a Get for my wife,\" and then went on his roof, from whence he fell and died; Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, \"The sages decided upon that occasion, that if he fell down with premeditation [on his part] the Get is valid, but not if the wind blew him down.\"",

Hanina of Ono brought with him from prison; [he said] \"I have received a tradition, that when the husband said to three men, 'Give my wife a Get,' that they may depute others to write it, because the constituted them a tribunal.\" R. José saith, \"We tell this emissary, We [also] have a tradition, that when a husband had said even to the Great Tribunal in Jerusalem, 'Give my wife a Get,' the latter are bound to study [the laws of Get], write a Get, and deliver it to the wife.\" When a husband says to ten [men], \"Write ye and deliver a Get to my wife,\" one of that number shall write, and two others sign it, but if he said, \"Write it all of ye,\" then one shall write, and all must sign it.

When a person became dumb, and on being asked, \"Shall we write a Get for your wife?\" nods his head [in token of assent], he shall be questioned three times, and if he [by his motions or gestures] answers rightly the questions proposed to him, both affirmative and negative, they may in that case write a Get and deliver it to his wife.", 
            "If a person [in health, or a sick person acquainted with the Law] is asked, \"Shall we write a Get for your wife?\" and he answered, \"Write it;\" and they ordered the notary in consequence, who wrote it, and the witnesses, who signed it: although it was duly written, attested and delivered to the husband, who delivered it to his wife, nevertheless it is ineffective, because it is only then valid when the husband himself orders the notary to write, and the witnesses to attest it.", 
            "[When a husband says to his wife] \"This is your Get in case I die,\" or, \"If I die of this illness,\" or, \"To take effect after my decease,\" his words are vain; but if he said, \"Here is your Get, to take effect from this day,\" or, \"from this moment, if I should die,\" it is a valid Get. If he said, \"To take effect from this day and after my death,\" it is doubtful whether such Get is valid or not: and in case he dies [without leaving issue], his widow must perform the ceremony of Chalitzah to her brother-in-law, but the latter may not marry her by Yeboom.  If he said, \"This is your Get from this day if I die of this illness,\" and he rose [from his sick bed], went out into the street, and became ill again and died: if he died in consequence of a relapse of the former illness the Get is valid, but not otherwise.", 
            "Under the mentioned circumstances  the wife may not meet the husband but in the presence of witnesses. A slave or a bondwoman is a competent witness for this purpose, her own bondwoman excepted, because a mistress is usually quite familiar with such a one. How is she to be considered during that interval? According to R. Jehudah, \"As a married woman in every respect,\" but according to R. José, \"As one whose divorce is doubtful.\"", 
            "If he [a husband] says, \"Here is your Get, on condition that you give me two hundred zooz,\" she is divorced from the moment she accepts the Get, and is bound to pay the stipulated amount. If he said, \"On condition that you give me [two hundred zooz, or any other sum] within thirty days,\" and she consented and paid the amount agreed upon within the time stipulated, she is duly divorced, but not if she did not pay it within that time. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel relates, \"That once at Sidon a husband said to his wife, 'Here is your Get, on condition that you give me my ‏אצטלית‎,' and she lost it: the sages decided that the Get should be still valid, if she paid him a sum equal to the value thereof.\"", 
            "If a husband says to his wife, \"Here is your Get, on condition that you wait on my father,\" or \"suckle my child\" [the period allowed for the general duration of suckling a child is two years]. What period is she bound to suckle it? R. Jehudah saith, \"Eighteen months only, and if during that period the child or the father should die, the Get is valid.\" If he said, \"Here is your Get, on condition that you wait on my father for two years,\" or \"suckle my child two years,\" and either the child or the father dies, or that the latter refuses her services, without being angry with her, the Get is not valid: but Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel considers it valid under the mentioned circumstances, for he establishes it as a rule \"That every impediment which does not proceed from the part of the wife does not render the Get void.\"", 
            "Should a husband say to his wife, \"Here is your Get if I do not return within thirty days,\" and intending to travel from Judea into Galilee he returned after having proceeded to Antipatris only, he has voided his condition. If he said, \"Here is thy Get if I do not return within thirty days,\" and intending to travel from Judea to Galilee returns from the village Otenai, he has voided his condition. If he said, \"Here is thy Get if I do not return within thirty days,\" and intending to travel beyond sea he went only as far as Acco and returned, he has voided his condition. If he said, \"Here is thy Get if at any time I should stay away for thirty days from thee,\" though he should frequently go and return for that period, the Get is valid, provided he did not remain alone with her.", 
            "When a husband said to his wife, \"Here is thy Get if I do not return within a twelve-month,\" and he died within that twelvemonth, the Get is void; but if he said, \"This is thy Get from the present moment, if I do not return within a twelvemonth from this day,\" and he died within that time, the Get is valid.", 
            "When a husband said, \"If I do not return within a twelvemonth from this day, write ye, and deliver a Get to my wife;\" if they wrote it within the twelve-month, but did not deliver it till after that time, the Get is void. If he said, \"Write ye, and deliver a Get to my wife if I do not return within a twelve-month from this day;\" if they wrote it within that time, but did not deliver it till after the expiration thereof, the Get is void. R. José saith, \"It is valid in similar cases.\" If they wrote and delivered it after the expiration of the twelve-month, and the husband died meanwhile; if the delivery of the Get preceded the death of the husband, the Get is valid, but not if posterior to that event; and where it cannot be ascertained which event was prior to the other, she is to be considered as one whose divorce is doubtful."

            "When a husband throws a Get to his wife, when she is in her own house, or in the court she lives in, she is thereby divorced. If he threw it within his house or court, even if it lies near her on her bed, she is not divorced [thereby]; but if he threw it within her lap or her work basket, she is divorced.", 
            "If a husband said to his wife [about to be divorced], \"Take this bond,\" or, that she finds a document fastened to his back, which she reads, and finds to be a Get addressed to her, such a Get is void, while he does not expressly say, \"Here is thy Get of divorce.\" If he put it into her hands whilst she is asleep, and on waking she reads it, and finds it to be a Get addressed to her, it is void, until the husband says to her, \"Here is thy Get.\" If the wife was standing in a public place or street, and the husband throws it towards her: if it fell nearest to her, she is divorced, but not if it fell nearest to him; when it lies in the middle [between them], it is doubtful whether or not she is divorced.", 
            "It is even so with the marriage bond, and [the payment of] a debt. If a creditor said to his debtor, \"Throw me the payment of the debt due to me by you,\" and the latter did throw it: if it fell nearest the creditor, the debtor is free, but if it fell nearest to the debtor, this latter is liable; if it fell in the middle between them, both must share the risk. When a wife was standing on her roof, and her husband threw a Get to her: if it reached within the airspace of the roof, she is divorced. If the husband stood on the roof, and the wife below, and he threw the Get down to her, it is valid as soon as it arrived below the level of the roof, although it should [in its further descent] have become obliterated, or burned.", 
            "Beth Shammai decide, \"That a woman maybe divorced by an old Get;\" but Beth Hillel hold it to be prohibited. What is an old Get? Every Get [is so called] after the writing of which the husband was alone with his wife.", 
            "When a person dates a Get by a foreign reign, or according to the chronology of the Median or Greek monarchies, or [so many years] since the building of the Temple, or since the destruction of the Temple, or when West is written when it should be East, or the contrary, then a woman [who, upon the strength of such a Get, had remarried] must be separated from both husbands. She must receive a Get from both, and has no claim on either for the amount of her Ketubah, for her right of usufruct, for maintenance, and for the damage she might claim for the wear and tear of clothes belonging to her, and is bound to refund whatever she may have received on that account from either husband; her child by either husband is a bastard; neither of the husbands may [if they are priests] pollute themselves with her dead body, nor has either of them a right to what she may find or earn, or to annul her vows. If she is an Israelitess, she is disqualified to marry a priest; if the daughter of a Levite, she is prohibited to eat tithe; and if a priest's daughter, to eat heave; the heirs of neither husband have a right to her Ketubah, and when these husbands die, the brothers of both must have the ceremony of Chalitzah performed by her, but may not marry her by Yeboom. When his or her name, or the name of his or her city [or residence], have been written on the Get in a manner different [from the real names], she must [in case she remarried upon such a Get] be separated from both husbands, and she is subject to all the above-mentioned regulations.", 
            "In the cases of women who are within the degree of consanguinity with whom it is forbidden to intermarry, and whose rivals it is permitted to marry; should these rivals marry, and it is afterwards ascertained that the mentioned relations are unfit to bear children [‏אילונית‎], then the said rival must be separated from the husband she has married, and also from the brother-in-law, and is subject to all the mentioned regulations.", 
            "When a person marries his sister-in-law by Yeboom, and her [former] rival married some other person, and she who married the brother-in-law was then ascertained to be an ‏אילונית‎, then the said rival must be separated from the husband she married, and from the Yabam [or brother-in-law], and is subject to all the mentioned regulations.", 
            "When a notary writes a Get for a husband to divorce his wife, and an acquittance for the wife [acknowledging the receipt of the amount of her Ketubah], and gave by mistake the divorce to the wife, and the acquittance to the husband, who interchanged them with each other; and when, after a time, the mistake is discovered, by the Get being found in the husband's possession, and the acquittance in that of the wife, she must [if she had already married another husband] be separated from both, and is subject to all the above-mentioned regulations. R. Eleazar saith, \"If the error is discovered in time [i.e. before she remarried], the Get is void, but if not, it is valid; because the right of the first husband is insufficient to destroy the claim the second husband bas upon her.\" When a person wrote a Get to divorce his wife, and afterwards changed his mind, he has, according to Beth Shammai, already disqualified her to be married to the priesthood [at any time]; but, according to Beth Hillel, she is not disqualified, even in the case when he actually delivered a Get to her conditionally, which conditions were not fulfilled [and rendered the Get void].", 
            "When a person who had divorced his wife passes the night with her at an inn, Beth Shammai decide, \"She does not require another Get of him,\" but Beth Hillel consider it necessary. This difference of opinion is only when he divorced her after having been married, and cohabited with her; but if he divorced her when she was only betrothed to him, both schools agree that no second Get is necessary, because he has not yet been intimate with her. If a person married a woman who had been divorced with [a so called] bald Get [‏גט קרח‎], she must be separated from both husbands, and is subject to all the above-mentioned regulations [§ 5].", 
            "A bald Get may, according to ben Nanas, be made perfect by any one; but R. Akivah saith, \"It may only be perfected by persons whose evidence, when tendered in other cases in her behalf, is admissible, although they should be related to her.\" What is a bald Get? One which has more folds than subscribing witnesses."

        [
            "When a husband divorces his wife, and [on delivering the Get] says to her, \"Thou art herewith allowed to be married to any man except to A.B.,\" such a Get is said to be valid by R. Eleazar; but the sages declare it void. How must a husband act in such a case? He must take the Get back, and return it to her, saying at the same time to leer, \"Thou art herewith permitted to be married to all men.\" But if he wrote the exception in the Get, although he took it back and erased it, that Get is void.", 
            "If the husband said, \"Thou art herewith permitted to be married to any man, except to my father or to your father, to my or to your brother, to a slave or to a non-Israelite,\" or to any other person with whom she is interdicted by law to marry, the Get is valid. If he said, \"Thou art herewith permitted to be married to any one, except as a widow to a high priest, or as a divorced woman, or one released by Chalitzah, to an ordinary priest; as a bastardess or Nethinah to an Israelite, or as an Israelitess to a bastard or Netin,\" or to any with whom the marriage has a legal force, although it was illegally contracted; the Get is void [in all such cases].", 
            "The essential substance of a Get are the following words: \"Thou art [herewith] permitted [to be married] to all men.\" R. Jehudah saith [the following is the essential part], \"Thou hast herewith of me a writing of separation, a letter of divorce, and a document of dismissal, that thou mayest go and be married to any man thou mayest like.\" The essential substance of a document for the manumission of a slave, is the following: \"Thou art herewith a free woman [or man], and thou wilt henceforth [by virtue of this document] be dependant on thyself alone.\"", 
            "In three cases a Get is invalid, yet, any child born to the wife in a subsequent marriage is legitimate, viz. When a husband wrote the Get himself, but there are no subscribing witnesses to it; or, if the attestation was attached to it, but it wanted the date; or, that it was [properly] dated, but attested by one witness only. These are three cases when the Get is void, but in which a child born to the wife in a subsequent marriage is nevertheless legitimate. R. Eleazar saith, \"Although there be no attesting witnesses to the Get, it is still valid if the husband delivered it to the wife in the presence of witnesses; and [in respect to bonds given for debt, under similar circumstances] the creditor can recover it from mortgaged property, because the attestation of contracts by witnesses has been instituted, solely with a view to the promotion of order and regularity.\"", 
            "When two men sent two Gittin, exactly alike in their contents, and these became interchanged, both Gittin are to be delivered to each woman [in turn]; hence, when one of the said Gittin was lost, the other becomes ineffective. When five men write together in a single Get, the man A. to divorce his wife B., and the man C. his wife D., and so forth, and this is duly attested by the signature of witnesses, this Get will be valid to divorce all these [wives], and must be delivered to each [separately]. If, however, a Get was written on the same page for each woman, and duly subscribed by witnesses, then that Get only is valid to which the signature of the witnesses are read [with].", 
            "When two Gittin are written by the side of each other [on the same page], and they are undersigned by two witnesses [who sign] in Hebrew, underneath each other, and it is further signed by two other witnesses, who sign in Greek, also underneath each other, then, that Get only is valid to which the first witnesses are read. But if it was signed alternately by a witness in Hebrew, and by another in Greek, underneath each other, both Gittin are void.", 
            "If part of a Get was written on the second column of a page, and the witnesses have signed underneath, it is valid. If the witnesses signed it at the beginning of the second column, or in the margin, or on the back of a plain Get, it is void. If the commencement of one Get was written at the side of the commencement of the other, and the witnesses signed in the middle, both are void. [If the end of the one is at the side of the end of the other, and the signatures of the witnesses between them, that with which the attestation is read is valid]. If the commencement of the second Get followed immediately the end of the first, with the names of the witnesses at the bottom [between the two], then that Get only is valid to which, at its conclusion, the names of the witnesses are read.", 
            "A Get written in Hebrew but attested in Greek, or one written in Greek but attested in Hebrew, or to which one witness attested in Hebrew and another in Greek, or one attested by the writer and another witness, is valid. If only the plain [or given] name of a witness is signed to the Get [without his father's name], with the addition of the word \"witness,\" it is valid. Also, if it was signed \"son of A.B. witness;\" or, when he wrote his own and his father's name, but omitted the word \"witness\" [it is also valid], for thus was it customary among the, pure or liberal men of Jerusalem. If the surname of either the husband or the wife had also been written in the Get, it is valid likewise. A Get written in consequence of a compulsive legal decree by an Israelite tribunal is valid; but not one which was forcibly imposed by the, mandate of a non-Israelite tribunal. Yet the latter is nevertheless valid, when the non-Israelite tribunal compels it in accordance with the Israelite law, and orders the culprit to conform to what the Israelite law requires of him.", 
            "When a rumour prevails in a town that a woman had been betrothed, that woman must be considered as one betrothed.  If it is again reported that she had been divorced, she must be considered as a divorced woman; but this is only when no reasons for doubt exist. Reasons for doubt are, for instance, when it is reported that such a one was divorced but conditionally; or that he threw the marriage-bond towards her, and it is doubtful whether it fell nearest to him or her. These are reasons for doubt.", 
            "Beth Shammai say, \"No man may divorce his wife, unless he found in her scandalous behaviour [unchastity], for it is said [Deu. xxiv.], 'Because he found in her some scandalous behaviour [‏ערוה‎];'\" but Beth Hillel say, \"Even if she spoiled his food, because it is said, [‏ערות דבר‎]\".  R. Akivah saith, \"Even if he found one handsomer than her, for it is said [ibid.] 'If it happen that she found no favor in his eyes.'\""
