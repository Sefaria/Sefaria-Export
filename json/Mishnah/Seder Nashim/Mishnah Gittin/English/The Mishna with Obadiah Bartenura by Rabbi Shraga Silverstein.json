            "\tIf one brings a get from medinath hayam (lit., \"the land of the sea,\" i.e., abroad), he must say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" [Anything outside of Eretz Yisrael is called \"medinath hayam.\" (\"He must say: 'Before me, it was written, etc.'\":) Some say, because those living abroad are not learned in Torah, and they do not know that a get must be written lishmah (i.e., for the specific instance). Therefore, the messenger says: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed,\" and, as a matter of course, he is asked if it were written lishmah, and he replies that it was. Others say it is because caravans are infrequent between there and here (Eretz Yisrael) so that if the husband protested that he did not write it, witnesses could not be found to corroborate the signatures of the witnesses, for which reason the rabbis believed the messenger as two, and the protest of the husband no longer availed.] R. Gamliel says: Even one who brings it from Rekem and from Cheger (which are close to Eretz Yisrael, must say: \"Before me, etc.\") [The Targum for (Genesis 16:14): \"between Kadesh and Bared\" is \"between Rekam and Chagra.\"] R. Eliezer says: Even from Kfar Ludim [which is outside Eretz Yisrael] to Lud [which is near it, and part of Eretz Yisrael.] And the sages say: Only one who brings a get from abroad and one who takes (a get from Eretz Yisrael abroad) must say: \"Before me it was written, and before me, it was signed.\" And one who brings it from one province to another in medinath hayam must say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me, it was signed.\" R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Even from one hegemony to another [with distinct jurisdiction].",
            "\tR. Yehudah says: From Rekem until [the end of the world] eastward [is considered outside of Eretz Yisrael], and Rekem [itself is considered] as the east [of the world, and not as Eretz Yisrael]. From Ashkelon southward, and Ashkelon as the south. From Acco northwards, and Acco as the north. R. Meir says: Acco is as Eretz Yisrael in respect to gittin.",
            "\tIf one brings a get in Eretz Yisrael, he need not say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" If there are \"protestors\" against it, [the husband protesting that it is forged], it is confirmed through its signatures. [If witnesses testify to (the authenticity of) their signatures, or if other witnesses recognize their signatures, it is valid. And nowadays, if one brings a get, whether in Eretz Yisrael or abroad, he must give it to her in the presence of two witnesses and say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\"] If one brings a get from abroad, he cannot say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed\" [(as when he gave it to her when he could speak, and he did not get to say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed\" before he became mute)]. If there are witnesses signed on it, it is confirmed through their signatures.",
            "\tBoth the gittin of women and the manumissions of bondsmen are alike in respect to taking and bringing, [vis-à-vis the saying of: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed\"]. And this is one of the ways in which the gittin of women are similar to the manumissions of bondsmen.",
            "\tEvery bill on which a Cuthite witness is signed is invalid, except the gittin of women and the manumissions of bondsmen, [which are valid if one of the witnesses is a Cuthite. But if both are Cuthites, the first tanna invalidates it, even with the gittin of women.] The get of a woman on which Cuthite witnesses were signed was once brought before R. Gamliel in Kfar Otnai, and he validated it. [R. Gamliel validated it even where both were Cuthites. And today, after the decree that Cuthites be considered like gentiles in all respects, the gittin of women are not different from other writs; even one Cuthite witness renders a writ invalid.] All writs which are adjudicated in gentile courts, [the witnesses having testified before the judge in their place of judgment], even if they are signed by gentiles, are valid. [This, where we know the judge and the witnesses not to take bribes], except for the gittin of women and the manumissions of bondsmen. [(The validity obtains) only in respect to writs of loans and sales, where the witnesses beheld the transfer of money. But writs of indebtedness and the gittin of women, and all things which are enactments of beth-din — all such things are invalid in their courts.] R. Shimon says: These, too, are valid. They were not mentioned [in the house of study as being invalid] except where they were enacted by [gentiles who were] laymen, [not judges. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]",
            "\tIf one says: Give this get to my wife, or this writ of manumission to my bondsman, if he wishes to retract with both, [before they reach the hand of the woman or of the bondsman], he may do so [and the messenger may not acquire the writ on their behalf; for it is a liability to them in that it deprives them of their sustenance.] These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say: [He may retract] with the gittin of women, but not with the manumissions of bondsmen. [And the halachah is in accordance with the sages.] For a man is accorded benefit even not in his presence, but liability is imposed upon him only in his presence. For if he wished not to feed his bondsman, he could do so, [so that when he frees him he does not cause him to lose his sustenance]; but he is not permitted not to feed his wife, [so that when he divorces her, he causes her to lose her sustenance.] He (R. Meir) said to them: But he disqualifies his bondsman from terumah, just as he disqualifies his wife! They answered: That is because he is his acquisition. [That is, the reason the bondsman of a Cohein eats terumah is that he is his acquisition — just as the beast of a Cohein eats terumah vetch, and there is no ascendancy in this. Therefore, if he frees him, even though he disqualifies him from eating terumah, this is no liability to the bondsman.] If one says: Give this get to my wife, or (give) this writ of manumission to my bondsman, and he died, they are not to be given after his death. [For it is not a get until it reaches her hand, and when it reaches her hand, he is dead; and there is no get after death. And with the writ of manumission, too, when it reaches his (the bondsman's) hand, he (the owner) is dead and has no authority over him.] (If one says:) Give a manah to this and this man, and he dies, it is to be given after his death [even if he did not say: \"this manah,\" for the words of a shechiv mera (one at the point of death) are as \"written and given\"]."

[This, if only the last half (were written); but (if he said:) \"Before me, the first half (containing the names of the man and the woman and the date) was written,\" it is valid. And for the first half, too, it is not necessary that he witness the writing itself; but if he heard the sound of the pen upon the paper at the time of writing, it is sufficient.] If one says: \"Before me, it was written,\" and the other: \"Before me, it was signed,\" it is invalid. [This, when the get is brought by one of them. For the rabbis required the messenger bringing the get to say both. But if the get were brought by both, it is valid, two who bring a get not being required to say: \"Before me, it was written and before me it was signed.\" If two say: \"Before us, it was written,\" and one says: \"Before me, it was signed,\" it is invalid. [This, when the get is brought by one of them; but if it is brought by both, it is valid.] And R. Yehudah rules it valid [even if it is brought by one of them. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",
            "\tIf it were written in the daytime and signed in the daytime; in the night, and signed at night; at night, and signed in the daytime — it is valid. [For the day appertains to the night (preceding it), so that it (the date on the get) is not mukdam (prior, to the date of the signing)]. (If it were written) in the daytime, and signed at night, it is invalid. [For it is mukdam. The rabbis instituted a date in gittin as a decree, lest one be married to his sister's daughter, and she be adulterous, and he, pitying her, that she not be put to death by strangulation, give her an undated get, so that when they testify against her in beth-din, she could produce her get and say: \"I was divorced and single at that time.\"] R. Shimon rules it valid, R. Shimon saying that all gittin written in the daytime and signed at night are invalid, except for the gittin of women. [For R. Shimon holds that the sages instituted a date in gittin because of fruits. For if there were no date on the get, the husband could continue selling the nichsei melog fruits of his wife after divorcing her, and when a claim were brought against him, he could say: \"I sold them before the divorce.\" And, accordingly, R. Shimon rules that a get written in the daytime and signed at night is valid, even though it is mukdam; for he holds that once her husband determined to divorce her, even though he did not yet do so, he no longer has title to the fruits. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]",
            "\tGittin can be written with all things: with ink, with paint, with sikra [a red dye], with gum resin, with vitriol, and with all (other) things whose impression remains. They are not written with juices or with fruit-liquid, or with any (other) thing whose impression does not remain. Gittin are written on all things: on a [torn-off] olive leaf, on the horn of a cow (and he gives her the cow) [for he cannot cut the horn off after he writes it, it being written (Deuteronomy 24:1): \"And he shall write her a scroll of divorce, and he shall place it in her hand\" — that which lacks only writing and giving; to exclude that which lacks writing, cutting and giving]; on the hand of a bondsman, and he gives her the bondsman. R. Yossi Haglili says: Gittin are not written on things which have a spirit of life, and not on foods. [For the Torah called a get \"sefer\" (a scroll). Just as a scroll is characterized by not having a spirit of life and not being edible, so, all that does not have a spirit of life and is not edible. And the rabbis say: if it were written: \"in a sefer,\" it would be as you say. But now that it is written \"sefer,\" sefirath devarim (\"relating details\" of the get) is the intent. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tGittin are not written on what is attached to the ground, [\"cutting\" lacking]. If it were written on what was attached, torn off, signed, and given to her, it is valid. [This is what is meant: If he wrote the tofess (the entire get excluding the place of the man, the place of the woman, and the date) on something attached to the ground, and it were torn off and signed — that is, if he wrote the toref (the place of the man and the woman and the date) after it were torn off, it is valid. For since the toref was written on what was torn off, even though the tofess was written on what was attached, it is valid.] R. Yehudah rules it to be invalid, until it be both written and signed on what is detached. R. Yehudah b. Betheira says: Gittin are written neither on erased paper nor on diftera, for it lends itself to forging. And the sages permit it. [(\"neither on erased paper\":) For he can erase what he wishes up to the (signatures of the) witnesses, and write above it what he wishes, without anything being noticed, the witnesses, too, being signed on what is erased. (\"diftera\":) Its erasure is not noticeable. Diftera is a skin prepared with salt and flour, but not with gall-nut. (\"And the sages permit it\":) with gittin only, the sages holding that the witnesses of delivery (of the get to the woman) effect the divorce, and not the witnesses of the signing. But with other writs, where the witnesses of the signing are relied upon, the sages agree that they are written neither on erased paper nor on diftera. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tAll are fit to write a get, even a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor. [This, on condition that an adult stands over him and tells him: \"Write it on behalf of that man.\" But a gentile or a bondsman, even if an adult stands over him, should not write the get ab initio, for they are of independent intellect, and act on their own behalf; so that even if an adult tells them to write it for someone else, they write it on their own. And if a gentile or a bondsman writes the tofess of the get, and a knowing Israelite writes the toref — the name of the man and the woman and the date, all of these requiring lishmah (specific intent) — the get is valid. Likewise, a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, who, according to our Mishnah, are fit to write a get, are fit only with respect to the tofess, but, with respect to the toref, it is not valid unless written by a knowing, adult Israelite.] The woman may write her get, and the man may write his receipt (of payment of the kethubah). For the get takes effect only through its signatories. All are fit to bring the get, except a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, [who lack independent intellect], one who is blind [He is not qualified to bring the get from abroad, not being able to say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" But to bring a get in Eretz Yisrael, where he need not say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed\" — or even abroad, if the get is validated through its signatories, or to be the woman's messenger to receive her get — for all of these, a blind man is fit], and a gentile. [For he is not included in the Law of gittin and kiddushin (marriage). And in an area where he himself is not included, he cannot serve as a messenger for another.]",

But if he possesses his faculties, and then became a deaf-mute, and then regained his faculties; if he possessed sight, and then became blind, and then regained his sight [(it is valid) even if he did not regain his sight. For since he possessed sight when he received the get, he is qualified to be a messenger, being able to say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" But since we must learn later: \"and then he regained his intellect,\" that he must be of independent intellect at the time of giving, we also learn in the beginning: \"and then he regained his sight.\" And all who are unfit to testify by reason of transgression are not fit to bring the get, not being believed to say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" And if the get were validated through its signatories, they are fit to bring it.]; if he possessed intellect, and then became an imbecile, and then regained his intellect, it is valid. This is the rule: Wherever there is da'ath (independent intellect) in the beginning and in the end, it (the get) is valid.",

Even more: If he wrote it to divorce his wife therewith [i.e., not only is a get not written for divorce but for practice invalid; but even one written for the sake of divorce], if he changed his mind, and one of his townsmen found it, and said: \"My name is the same as yours, and my wife's name, the same as your wife's name,\" it is invalid as a divorce. Even more, if he had two wives with the same name, and he wrote it to divorce the elder, he may not divorce the younger with it. [Not only is it invalid if it were not written for the sake of divorce of this man, but even if one had two wives, in which instance it was written for the sake of divorce of this man, it is invalid, since it was not written for the sake of divorce of this particular woman.

Therefore, they would forbear from administering the oath to her, and she would lose her kethubah.] R. Gamliel the elder instituted that she vow to the orphans whatever (formula of vow) they desire [such as: \"I bevow enjoyment of this and this food if I have derived any benefit from my kethubah\"], and she collects her kethubah. [And if she remarried before the orphans bevowed her for her kethubah, in which instance her husband might nullify her vow, what do they do? They beswear her, outside of beth-din an \"oath of the rabbis,\" transgression of which is not so severe (as that of a Torah oath), and she takes her kethubah after she is married.

But because of \"the general good\" — because we fear that one of the witnesses to the delivery might die, and the get be like a mere shard in her hand, (it was instituted that witnesses sign)]. Hillel instituted the prozbol for \"the general good.\" [For because he saw the people forbearing to lend each other (in apprehension of the loan's being dissolved by the shemitah year), and (by their forbearance) transgressing (Deuteronomy 15:9): \"Take heed unto yourself lest there be in your heart a thing of wickedness, etc.\" — he arose and instituted the prozbol.

Shimon b. Gamliel says: He [the bondsman] does not write [him a bill of debt, for he owes him nothing. But his first master, who \"damaged\" what was owing the second must pay him his worth.

These are the words of Beth Hillel. Beth Shammai said to them: \"You have 'amended' his master, [who loses nothing], but you have not amended him!\" He cannot marry a bondswoman, for he is half-free. He cannot marry a free-woman, for he is half-bondsman. Not to marry — Was the world not created for fruitfulness and multiplication, viz.

(He may not take her back) lest she go and marry another and the report of infidelity be found false or she be absolved of the vow by a sage, so that she not be a \"wanton vower,\" and the husband say: \"Had I known this, even if they had given me a hundred manah, I would not have divorced her,\" thereby voiding the get and rendering her children mamzerim. Therefore, he is told: \"Be apprised that if one divorces his wife because of an evil report or because of a vow, he may never take her back,\" hearing which, he divorces her categorically, and he can no longer compromise her.] R. Yehudah says: With every vow known to many, he may not take her back; not known to many, he may take her back. [R. Yehudah holds that the rabbis said: \"If one divorced his wife because of an evil report or because of a vow, he may not take her back,\" so that the daughters of Israel not be promiscuous with arayoth (illicit connections) or with vows, for which reason he says that with every vow known to many (ten or more Israelites), there is relatively greater promiscuity, and she was penalized not to be taken back. And with what is not known to many, there is relatively less promiscuity, and she was, accordingly, not penalized.] R. Meir says: With every vow that requires the deliberation of a sage, he may not take her back. (With every vow) that does not require the probing of a sage, he may take her back. [R. Meir holds the rationale (for forbidding him to take her back) is the possibility of undermining (the get). Therefore, with a vow that he himself cannot annul, but which only a sage can absolve her of, he can undermine the get after she remarries by saying: \"Had I known that a sage could have absolved you of it, I would not have divorced you.\" But with a get that does not require the probing of a sage, but which can be annulled by the husband himself, the sages did not need to forbid him to take her back. For he cannot compromise her by saying: \"Had I known, etc.\", for it was an \"open\" vow, which he could have annulled, and he did not.] R. Eliezer said: They forbade the one [i.e., taking her back in the instance of a vow which requires the probing of a sage] only because of the other [which does not require it. For with one that does require it, we need not fear undermining, for he cannot say: \"Had I known that a sage could have absolved her of it, I would not have divorced her.\" For \"we are witnesses\" that even had he known it, he would have divorced her, a man not wanting his wife to be demeaned in beth-din before a sage, to go to his beth-din and to inquire as to her oath. But it is because of a vow that does not require a sage, which the husband himself could have annulled, that they forbade (him to take her back) in all instances, that he not say: \"Had I known that I could have annulled it, I would not have divorced her.\"] R. Yossi b. R. Yehudah said; It happened in Tziddon that one said to his wife: \"I vow to divorce you,\" and he divorced her, and the sages permitted him to take her back, for \"the general good.\" [The gemara explains that something is lacking and that this is the intent: When is this so (that he may not take her back)? When she vowed. But if he vowed to divorce her, and he divorced her, he may take her back, and we do not fear any undermining. And R. Yossi b. R. Yehudah said: It also happened in Tziddon that one said to his wife: \"Konam, if I do not divorce you.\" That is: May all the fruits in the world be forbidden to me if I do not divorce you. And he divorced her, and the sages permitted him to take her back.

For he permitted her to all men in giving her the get. It is just that he stipulated that she not wed a particular man, which is like any other condition. And the rabbis forbade him to say: \"This is your get on condition that you marry that man,\" so that their wives not be regarded as gifts to be given to one another. And any condition that one attaches to the get before he writes it, though it not be written in the get, invalidates it. But after he places the get in her hand, he may make any condition he desires.]",
            "\t(If he said:) You are permitted to all men except my father and your father, my brother and your brother, a bondsman and a gentile, and to all others with whom marriage does not obtain, the get is valid. (If he said:) You are permitted to all men, except a widow to a high-priest, a divorcée and a chalutzah to a regular priest, a mamzereth and a Nethinah to an Israelite, the daughter of an Israelite to a mamzer and a Nathin, and to all others with whom marriage does obtain, even (marriage) in transgression, the get is void. [Since marriage obtains with those interdicted by negative commandment, but not with this one because of the stipulated interdict, it emerges that the get is not all-inclusive.]",
            "\tThe basic text of the get: \"You are permitted to all men.\" R. Yehudah says: \"And this shall be to you from me a writ of divorce, a letter of leaving, a get of dismissal (wherewith) to go and marry any man you desire.\" [For it must be manifest that he divorces her with this writ; and if he does not write it thus, they might come to say that he divorced her by speech alone, of which the writ is only confirmation. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah.] The basic text of a writ of manumission: \"You are free.\" \"You belong to yourself.\"",
            "\tThree gittin are invalid, but if she married (through one of them) the child is kasher: a get written in his hand, but without witnesses [According to R. Meir, who says that the witnesses of the signing effect the divorce, his handwriting is equivalent to a hundred witnesses. According to R. Elazar, who says that the witnesses to the delivery effect the divorce, since it is in his handwriting, it satisfies (Deuteronomy 24:3): \"And he shall write … and he shall give.\" And even though there are no witnesses to the delivery, it is valid according to Scripture. And the sages ruled it invalid lest a get come to be validated with the writing of the scribe alone.]; a get with witnesses but without a date [the date being a rabbinic ordinance, either because of fruits or because of the possibility of his shielding his sister's daughter (See 2:2)]; a get with a date but with only one witness. [According to one view, this refers to (a get) written in his hand, the first instance (of the Mishnah) apprising us that even without a witness the child is kasher, and this instance, that even if there were one witness, it should not be done ab initio. And according to another view, this refers to (a get) written in the scribe's hand, notwithstanding which the child is kasher, the scribe standing in place of a second witness.] These are the three gittin which, (though) invalid, if she marries (thereby) the child is kasher. R. Eliezer says: Even if there are no witnesses (signed) on it, but he gives it to her in the presence of witnesses, the get is valid and she collects (her kethubah) from bound property, for witnesses sign on a get only for \"the general good\" [lest the witnesses to the delivery die and the husband come and protest, saying: \"I did not divorce her.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Elazar.]",
            "\tIf two men sent two gittin that were identical [in their names] and they got mixed up, both are given to each woman. Therefore, if one of them were lost, the second is void, [for we do not know whose it is.] If five men wrote a common [time] in one get, viz.: [\"On this day of the week] this man divorces this woman; this man, this woman, etc.\" and the witnesses (signed) below, they are all valid, and the get is to be given to each woman. If a separate text were written for each one, [i.e., a separate time for each one, viz.: \"On this day of the week this man divorces this woman,\" followed by the text of the get; then: \"On this day of the week this man divorces this woman,\" followed by the text of the get; and so with all], and the witnesses below, the get that the witnesses are read together with (i.e., the last one) is valid.",
            "\tTwo gittin written [on two pages], one beside the other, and two Hebrew witnesses, extending from under one (get) to under the other, [i.e., two Hebrews signed under one get, (their signatures extending) under the second; the name of the witness under the first get, and the name of his father under the second. Likewise, a second (Hebrew) witness under him] and two Greek witnesses [two Israelites, natives of Greece, who then signed in Greek script, which goes from left to right, so that the name of the witness is under the second get, and the name of his father under the first], the get that the witnesses are read together with is valid. [If the Hebrews are signed above, so that, Hebrew script going from right to left, the name of the witness is under the right hand get, and the name of his father under the left, the right hand get is valid. And if the Greeks are signed above, the left is valid; for the names of the witnesses are under the left. The rationale: We suspect that the latter witnesses might have adapted their script to the order employed by the first witnesses. So that if the Hebrews were signed above, from right to left, on the right hand get, when the two Greeks came to sign under them (on the left hand get), they might also have followed the order of the Hebrews, so that all four would have signed on the right hand get. Similarly, if the Greeks were signed above (on the left hand get), the Hebrews who came after them might have reversed the order of the Hebrew script and gone from left to right, so that all four would have signed on the left hand get.] One witness a Hebrew, one witness a Greek; one witness a Hebrew, one witness a Greek, extending from under one (get) to under the other — both are void. [The rationale: We suspect that the first Hebrew witness might have signed on the right hand get, from right to left, in the order of Hebrew script, and the second, Greek witness, on the left hand get, in the order of Greek script, from left to right; and that the third witness, a Hebrew, reversed the Hebrew order and also began from the left, like the Greek before him, so that he, too, is signed on the left hand get; and that the last, Greek witness, signed in his customary way, from left to right, so that he, too, is signed on the left hand get — so that there are three witnesses signed on the left hand get, and only one on the right hand get. Or, the opposite: that the second, Greek witness, reversed his script to conform to the order of the Hebrew script and began from right to left, in the manner of the first, Hebrew witness; that the third Hebrew witness, signed in his customary manner, from the right — so that all three are signed on the right hand get; and that the second Greek witness alone signed in his customary way, on the left hand get. And since we do not know on which get three were signed, and on which, only one, both are void.]",
            "\tIf he left over part of the get and wrote it on the second page [opposite it on the breadth of the scroll], and the witnesses (signed) beneath it, it is valid. If the witnesses signed on the top of the page, on the side [of the page, to the right of the get or to the left], or on the back in a plain get, [whose witnesses are signed in it (as opposed to a get mekishar - See 8:9)], it is void. If he aligned the top of one (get) with the top of another, with the witnesses in the middle, both are void, [for the signatures are read with neither get.] (If he aligned) the bottom of one with the bottom of the other, with the witnesses in the middle, the get that the witnesses are read together with [i.e., the get whose end is followed by the beginning of the signatures (and not that whose beginning is preceded by the end of the signatures)] is valid.",
            "\tIf the get were written in Hebrew, and the witnesses (signed) in Greek; (if the get were written) in Greek, and the witnesses (signed) in Hebrew; if one witness (signed) in Hebrew, and the other in Greek; if the scribe and a witness signed — it is valid. [For there are two witnesses. The Mishnah apprises us that we do not suspect that the husband did not instruct the scribe to sign, but that he charged two men to tell the scribe to write the get and two witnesses to sign, and that these, feeling that the scribe might be offended (viz.: \"I am not fit to be a witness in his eyes\") instructed the scribe to sign without the husband's permission. We do not entertain this suspicion.] (If he signed:) \"so and so, witness,\" it is valid; \"the son of so and so, witness,\" it is valid; \"so and so, the son of so and so,\" without \"witness,\" it is valid. And this (the last) is what the \"clean-minded men of Jerusalem\" did. If he wrote his family epithet and her family epithet (instead of their actual names), it is valid. A get given under coercion — (If the coercion were) by Israelites [i.e., if they coerced him by law, as in all of those instances where one is coerced to divorce his wife, or if she were forbidden to him], it is valid. [And if they coerced him unlawfully, the get is void, but it forbids her to the priesthood because of \"the odor of a get.\"] And (if the coercion were) by gentiles, it is void. [If lawfully, it is void, but forbids her to the priesthood. If unlawfully, there is not even \"the odor of a get.\"] And by gentiles, if he is beaten and told: \"Do what the Israelites tell you,\" it is valid. [If one is required to give a get by law and the Israelite judges lack the power to force him to do so, he may be beaten by gentiles, who say: \"Do what the Israelites tell you,\" and he gives the get at the behest of the Israelite judges.]",
            "\tIf her name went out in the city as betrothed, [If a report were circulated about a single girl: \"This girl was betrothed to this man today\" (not where there was a mere rumor, but where lamps were lit and beds were spread, and people went in and out saying: \"She was betrothed today\"], she is [assumed to be] betrothed. (If a report went out that) she were divorced, she is (assumed to be) divorced. [This refers to the beginning, viz.: This woman about whom a report went out that she was betrothed, which report we entertain, forbidding her to marry any man but that one — if there then went out about her a report that she were divorced, that the man who had married her had divorced her], she is (assumed to be) divorced [and is permitted to all men; for the report that we entertained in the beginning — \"its receipt has come with it\"]. This, so long as there be no attenuation (amathla) to it [i.e., that there not be with the report of betrothal or of divorce an amathla, a consideration which breaks the power of the report]. What is (an instance of) an amathla? \"That man divorced his wife on condition\"; \"He threw her her (instrument of) betrothal, possibly near her (in which instance she is betrothed); possibly near him\" (in which instance she is not betrothed). This is an amathla.",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: A man should not divorce his wife unless he find her to be unchaste, viz. (Deuteronomy 24:1): \"…for he has found in her a thing of nakedness.\" And Beth Hillel say: Even if she spoiled his meal, [\"burning it\" by fire or by salt, Beth Hillel expounding \"a thing of nakedness,\" as either \"nakedness\" or \"a thing\"; that is, any foul thing, aside from nakedness.] R. Akiva says: Even if he find one more beautiful than she, viz. (Ibid.): \"And it shall be, if she does not find favor in his eyes.\" [He expounds the verse thus: If she does not find favor (of beauty) in his eyes, or if he find nakedness in her, or a foul thing — for any one of these three, he may divorce her. The halachah is in accordance with Beth Hillel.]"
