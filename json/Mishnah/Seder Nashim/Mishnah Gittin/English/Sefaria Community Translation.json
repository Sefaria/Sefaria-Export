[If] one says, \"It was written in my presence,\" and one says, \"It was signed in my presence,\" it is invalid. [If] two say, \"It was written in our presence,\" and one says, \"It was signed in my presence,\" it is invalid. But Rabbi Yehudah declares it valid. [If] one says, \"It was written in my presence,\" and two say, \"It was signed in our presence,\" it is valid.",
            "If it was written in the daytime and signed in the daytime,  [or written] at night and signed at night, [or written] at night, but signed in the daytime, it is valid. If it was written in the daytime, but signed at night, it is invalid. But Rabbi Shimon declares it valid, as Rabbi Shimon would say, \"All documents written during the daytime and signed at night are invalid, except for bills of divorce.\"",
            "One may write [a bill of divorce] with any [material]: with ink, with paint, with red paint, with gum, or with vitriol black, and with every other permanent material. One may not write [it] with a drink, nor with fruit juice, nor with any impermanent material. One may write [it] on anything: on an olive leaf; on a cow's horn, but he must give her the cow; on the hand of a slave, but he must give her the slave. Rabbi Yossi HaGelili says, \"One may not write on anything that has the spirit of life, nor on foods.\" ",
            "One may not write [it] on anything that is attached to the ground. [If] one wrote it on something attached, [and] he detached it and signed it and gave it to her, it is valid. Rabbi Yehudah declares it invalid, until its writing and its signing be on something that is detached [from the ground]. Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteirah says, \"One may not write it erased paper, nor on hide prepared for writing, because it can be [easily] forged.\" But the Sages declare it valid.",
            "All are qualified to write a bill of divorce, even a deaf-mute, a <i>shoteh</i> and  a minor. A woman may write her own bill of divorce, and the husband his receipt [for the amount of the <i>ketubah</i> [monetary settlement payable to a married woman upon divorce or the death of her husband] he has paid her], because the affirmation of legal documents depends solely on the signers. All are valid [agents] to bring a bill of divorce, except for a deaf-mute, an <i>shoteh</i>, a minor, a blind person, and a non-Jew.",

But [if he] was hearing, and became deaf and then recovered his hearing; or he was seeing, and he became blind, and then recovered his sight; or a mentally competent person, and he became a <i>shoteh</i>, and then became mentally competent again, it is valid. This is the rule: Any case in which [at] the beginning and end [he] was with [his] full faculties, it is valid.",

What is the difference between [testifying about] a bill of divorce and [about] death? Because [with regard to the bill of divorce] the writing, [i.e., the bill itself,] proves [the testimony to be accurate].

            "At first, a man [who had already sent his wife a bill of divorce by means of a messenger] would set up a religious court in a different place [from where the wife lived] and cancel [the bill of divorce].  Rabban Gamliel the Elder enacted that they not be able to do this, due to [the need for] repairing the world [<i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>].  At first, a man could change his name and her name, the name of his city, or the name of her city.   Rabban Gamliel the Elder enacted that one would write: \"The man, So-and-so, and any other name that he has, and the woman, So-and-so, and any other name that she has,\" due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.",

They stopped imposing an oath; Rabban Gamliel the Elder enacted that she may make a vow with regard to whatever they desire, and collects her <i>ketubah</i>.  Witnesses sign on a bill of divorce, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.  Hillel instituted the <i>pruzbul</i> [a court-issued exemption from the Sabbatical year cancellation of a personal loan] due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>. ",

If [he was ransomed] to be a free man, he may not be enslaved. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: \"Either way he may be enslaved.\" [With regard to] a slave whose master mortgaged him to others, and then freed him, the baseline law is that the slave is not obligated at all. However, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i> they force his [second] master to free him, and [the slave must] write a document [of debt] for his money's worth to him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: \"[The slave] does not write [a debt document], rather the [original] one who freed him [does].\"",

Beit Shammai said to them: \"You have repaired [the situation] for his master, but for himself you have not repaired it. To marry a maidservant is impossible [i.e., forbidden], for he is half-free. [To marry] a free-woman is impossible, for he is half-slave. And was not the world created for the sake of reproduction, as it says (Isaiah 45:18) \"Not for emptiness did He create it, but for settlement He formed it.\" Rather, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>, we force his master and he makes him a free-man, and [the slave] writes a document [of debt] for half his value.

We do not buy <i>sefarim</i> [books of the Tanach written in holiness, on parchment, and used for personal or public study, or for reading aloud in public. Sometimes the intent is specifically Torah scrolls], tefillin, and mezuzot from the non-Jews for more than their worth, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.",
            "[With regard to] one who divorced his wife due to her bad reputation, he may not remarry her. If it was because of a vow [that she made], he may not remarry her. Rabbi Yehudah says, \"[In the case of] any vow that was known to the public, he may not remarry her. [But for one] that was not known to the public, he may remarry her.\" Rabbi Meir says, \"[In the case of] any vow that required the inspection of a Sage[to determine if it can be annulled], he may not remarry her. If it does not require inspection of a Sage, he may remarry her.\" Rabbi Eliezer said, \"This one was only prohibited due to that one. Rabbi Yossi, son of Rabbi Yehudah, said, \"There was an occurrence in Sidon with one man who said to his wife, \"I take a vow if I do not divorce you, and he divorced her.

[If he did so] unwittingly, he is exempt [from paying damages]; if on purpose, he is liable. Kohanim who purposely render sacrifices ‏<i>pigul</i> [a sacrifice that becomes unfit, due to the intention of the officiating priest, while offering it, to consume it outside its permitted time], are liable.",

            "The law of <i>sikrikon</i> [violent individuals who acquired fields and houses by use or threat of force, including murder] was not in force in Judea during the time of the war when many Jews were being killed, but from that time on it did apply. How so? If one purchased land from the <i>sikrikon</i>, and then he purchased it from its [rightful] owner, the sale is void; however, [if he purchased it] from the owner and then he purchased it from the <i>sikrikon</i>, the sale is valid. If one purchased [a field] from the husband, and then he purchased it from his wife, the sale is void; but [if he purchased it first] from the wife, and then he purchased it from the husband, the sale is valid. This was the first teaching. But a different court decided that one who purchases [a field] from the <i>sikrikon</i> must pay a quarter to the [rightful] owner. This is when it is not in [the owner's] ability to repurchase [his field]; but if he has the ability to repurchase the field, [the owners] are preferred over anyone else [to repurchase the field]. Rabbi [Yehudah HaNasi] established a court and they decided by consensus that if [a field] remained in the hands of  the <i>sikrikon</i> for twelve months, whoever precedes others gains the rights [to purchase the filed] but he must pay a quarter to the [previous] owner.",

Rabbi Yossi says, \"It is actual theft.\" We do not prevent non-Jewish poor from gathering <i>leket</i>[that which is dropped in the course of harvesting, which is reserved for the poor] the forgotten [grain], and the produce of the corner of the field [reserved for the poor], due to \"ways of peace.\"",

[With regard to] a betrothed pubescent girl, either she or her father may accept her bill of divorce.

[With regard to] one who says, \"Give this bill of divorce to my wife in the place Such-and-such a place\" and [the messenger] gave it to her elsewhere, it is invalid. [But had the husband said merely] \"My wife is in Such-and-such a place\" and [the messenger] gave it her in another place, it is valid. [With regard to] a woman who says, \"Accept my bill of divorce on my behalf in Such-and-such a place,\" and he accepted it for her in another place, it is invalid;  Rabbi Eliezer declares it valid.
