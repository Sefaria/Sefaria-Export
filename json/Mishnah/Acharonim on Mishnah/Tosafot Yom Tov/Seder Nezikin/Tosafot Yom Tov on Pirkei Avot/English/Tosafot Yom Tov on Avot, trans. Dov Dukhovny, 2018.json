        "Pirkei Avot, Introduction": [
            "<b>Rambam</b> writes in his commentary to this mishna: <i>When Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi, the chief redactor of the Mishna, had covered all the laws a judge must know, he went on to tractate </i>Avot<i> for two reasons. First of all, to show that the accepted legal interpretations and traditions were genuine and well-established, and that they had been passed on from one group of scholars to another; and that, for this reason, one must honor and revere a Torah scholar, for the law has come down to and will now be decided by him, and he in his generation is just as his predecessors were in earlier generations. As the Sages said (Rosh HaShanah 2:10): “If we are going to cast doubt on the ruling of Rabban Gamliel’s court, we must likewise cast doubt on every court that has ever convened from the times of Moses until today!” And they likewise said (Rosh HaShana, 25a): “As Samuel was in his generation, so is Samson in his!”</i>",
            "This will teach people the important lesson that they shouldn’t say, Why should we accept such-and-such a ruling, or the enactment of judge so-and-so? That is not how things work! For a judgment is not merely the opinion of a particular judge—it is in fact the judgment of G-d, who has commanded us to follow it, as per the verse “For judgment is G-d’s (Deuteronomy 1:17).” And all of this is part and parcel of that one law, which is the result of the tradition as it has been passed from scholar to scholar throughout the generations.",
            "The second reason that Avot<i> immediately follows legal material is that Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi intended that this tractate contain the moral dicta of each of the Sages that we might learn proper behavior therefrom, and nobody is in greater need of this than the judges! For should one of the masses be a person of unrefined behavior he will hurt only himself and do no damage to the people as a whole, but a judge who is not humble and does not behave properly hurts both himself and others. For this reason, the first thing to be taken up in </i>Avot<i> is the proper behavior of judges (Avot 1:1): “Deliberate at length in your decisions!” A judge ought to behave in accordance with all of the dicta in </i>Avot<i>; he should, for instance, deliberate at length and not hasten to make his decisions, for there might be something afoot in the case; the Sages called such cases “suspicious cases” (Sanhedrin 32b). On the other hand, he shouldn’t delay when the case is a straightforward one, for this is called “painfully protracting the judgment” (Shabbat 33a). He should to thoroughly examine the witnesses and take care that he not let slip a stray word during the examination by which they might deduce how to go about accomplishing their goal in court. And one should not give legal guidance to one of the parties, as this would be “setting up the judges” (Avot 1:8). He should not do anything unbecoming his stature in the presence of the people, as they might then make light of him. He should not avoid people to the point that they cannot reach him when they need him, lest the pauper perish. He should not seek out leisure and pleasures, lest the truth perish. He should not be driven by desire.</i>",
            "He continues at length concerning the proper behavior of judges, and concludes by saying: <i>Seeing as the judge is in need of these numerous dicta in order to behave properly, how truly fitting to place </i>Avot<i> after tractate </i>Sanhedrin<i> and the other tractates related to it! For </i>Avot <i>contains these dicta and also contains other teachings that lead one to abstain from the pleasures of this world, honor Torah and its scholars, and act in accordance with integrity and the fear of G-d.</i>",
            "Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi called this tractate <i>Avot</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Forefathers” or “fathers”.</i> because the wise are our fathers in the truest sense, as Elisha said of his master Eliyahu (Kings II 2:12), “My father!

                    "MOSES RECEIVED THE TORAH AT SINAI. <b>Rav</b> explains “at Sinai” as really meaning “from the one who was revealed at Sinai,” i.e., G-d. And when G-d revealed Himself there, Moses received the Torah, down to its particulars and subtleties, and he did not bring forth any new laws himself, as per the Sifri that <b>Rashi</b> quotes in his Torah commentary to parashat Behar (Leviticus 25:1). To make this point, the mishna says “at Sinai.” This is not without purpose, as it points to the truth of the religion. “It is unique unto its mother”—that being the nation of Israel, who received it, “and it is the choicest of the one who birthed it”—the students, who are children of G-d.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on Song of Songs, 6:9.</i> Moses received everything, even the novel interpretations of a seasoned scholar, at Sinai, as per the verse (Deuteronomy 9:10), “And G-d gave me the two stone tablets, inscribed by the finger of the Lord, and (what was written) upon them was as all the things God had said to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of assembly,” which the Sages expounded in Megillah 19b as follows: <i>This teaches that G-d showed Moses even the most subtle points of the Torah</i> [Heb. dikdukei Torah]<i> and of the Sofrim</i> [Heb. dikdukei Sofrim]<i>.</i><br>I explain in my introduction to the Mishna that the <i>dikdukei Sofrim</i> were indeed only “shown” to Moshe.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And not “given” or “taught” to him, which TYT understands to mean that Moses did not acquire that knowledge the same way he acquired the main body of the Torah but was given some kind of lesser familiarity with it.</i> As such, the word “received” here must refer only to the greater part of the material. In the introduction to his commentary on the Torah, <b>Ramban </b>similarly explains the word “created” in the phrase “fifty levels of understanding were created in the word” as referring to most but not all of those levels, as the fiftieth was not created.",
                    "AND TRANSMITTED IT TO JOSHUA. All that he received, he transmitted to Joshua. But it cannot be said that G-d transmitted the Torah in its entirety to Moses, because not the entire Torah that G-d possessed was transmitted to him, as the fiftieth gate was not transmitted to him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Transmission here is understood to mean giving all that one has.</i> as the Sages expounded (Rosh HaShanah 21b) on the verse (Psalms 8:6) “And you have made him only slightly less than the Lord.” Therefore, in speaking of Moses the mishnah says that he “received” it, i.e. whatever he could receive, he received at Sinai. Thus do the commentaries explain it.",
                    "AND THE PROPHETS TRANSMITTED IT TO THE MEN OF THE GREAT ASSEMBLY. This is to point out that although not all the members of the Great Assembly were prophets, the entire Torah was transmitted to them as it was transmitted to their predecessors. From hereon, however, the generations waned and the entire Torah could not be transmitted to them; rather, each one received as much as he was able. Even so, what Torah he did acquire was part of the tradition, having passed sage from sage and going back to Moses at Sinai.",
                    "THE GREAT ASSEMBLY. <b>Rav</b> writes that they were called this because they “returned the crown to its former glory… Jeremiah and Daniel came, and did not say ‘the mighty and awesome one’ (Yoma 69b).” Jeremiah said, “The great and mighty one, whose name is Lord of Hosts (Jeremiah 32:18)”, but did not say “awesome”. Daniel said, “The great and awesome one (Daniel 9:4 ),” but did not say “mighty.”",
                    "THEY SAID THREE THINGS. <b>Rav </b>writes that of their many sayings, these three were the ones touching on the continuity of Torah. Later in Avot, 2:10, where the mishna also says “they said three things,” <b>Rav</b> offers as an alternate explanation that these were the dicta they constantly emphasized, as he writes on Avot 1:2.",
                    "AND YOU SHOULD TRAIN [<i>lit</i>. stand them up] MANY STUDENTS. They used the word <i>ha`amidu</i>, whose root <i>`amad</i> means “to stand,” because from the time of Moses until the time of Rabban Gamliel the students would stand during their studies (Megillah 21a) [as <b>Rav</b> writes on Sotah 9:16], while the master would sit on a chair—so <b>Midrash Shmuel</b>, in the name of <b>R. Yosef ibn Nahamias</b>. While this is a good derivation of the term <i>ha`amidu</i>, it does not convey the thrust of the mishna, which is not that the students should stand or sit, but that they should study. So why doesn’t the mishna, in accordance with its primary intent, simply use the verb “teach”?<br>It seems that the mishna uses this verb, <i>ha`amidu</i>, to emphasize that one ought to stand them up on their feet to the point that they don’t falter, i.e. to stand them on their feet in truly understanding Torah. This is called “standing” and “enduring” [<i>kiyum</i>, related to Heb. <i>kam</i>, “arose”], just as the Rabbinic expression says of a lie that it “has no legs on which to stand,” and as the Poet says, “My feet had nearly faltered” (Psalms, 73:2). And it is because the mishna dictated that one train many students that it had to use <i>ha`amidu</i>, to emphasize that although one ought to train many students, their studies should still be such that they should stand upon their own feet and reach truth in their learning. Anything else cannot properly be called <i>ha`amadah</i>, training a student and standing him upon his feet; such students rather “lie in slumber” (Isaiah 56:10), in the sleep of foolishness.<br>The upshot of all this is that we do not fulfill this dictum unless we teach truth and righteousness and nothing else. Cf. my comments on mishna 6."
                ],
                [
                    "THE WORLD STANDS. <b>Rav</b> understands this expression as “the world was only created for the purpose of.” <b>Midrash Shmuel</b> in his commentary to the last mishna in this chapter notes that he has found editions in which the text of our mishna has “for three things the world was created.”",
                    "ON THE TORAH. <b>Rav</b>: <i>had Israel not accepted the Torah, the heavens and the earth would not have been created, as per the verse “If not for my covenant, etc.” </i>(Jeremiah 33:25). <b>Rav</b> was led to this interpretation because he was bothered by the superfluousness of “the sacrificial service, and acts of kindness” in the text, for both of these are commandments, the fulfillment of which is already included in “the Torah”; he therefore understood that <i>the Torah</i> must refer not to the Torah itself but to its acceptance. The verse in Jeremiah is now read as “if not for my covenant which you have accepted, I would not have established the day or the night, nor even the laws of the heavens and the earth.” See the mishna in Nedarim 3:11 for a similar interpretive turn.<br>The difficulty with this is that the mishna is using the expression “the world stands on three things” to convey the importance of doing those things, and in <b>Rav</b>’s reading <i>“</i>the Torah” refers not to anything that one ought to do but to a historical event, and is out of place here. It seems, therefore, that “the Torah” here refers to the study and learning of Torah as opposed to the act of following its laws. The verse in Jeremiah, then, reads “if not for the study of my covenant by day and night, etc,” as per the verse “You shall study it day and night” (Hosea 1:8).<br>The words “had Israel not accepted the Torah” do not appear in <b>Rashi</b>’s commentary, which simply reads: On the Torah, <i>as per the verse “If not for my covenant, etc.”</i>.",
                    "AND ON THE SACRIFICIAL SERVICE. <b>Rav</b>: <i>the sacrificial service, as the tannaim taught in tractate Ta`anit</i>, “<i>if not for the shifts of priests offering sacrifices, etc.”</i> So also <b>Rashi</b>. They used the term <i>shaninu</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lit. “we have learnt,” a term used to indicate a tannaitic as opposed to amoraic text.</i> loosely, however, for this text does not appear in a mishna or baraita, and is actually an amoraic memra in the Talmud, Ta`anit 27b: <i>Rabbi Yaakov bar Acha said in the name of Rav Assi etc.</i><br>To be precise, the language of that memra is “if not for the shifts of priests offering sacrifices, the heavens and earth would not continue to exist”, and as such we cannot deduce therefrom that it is for the sake of these shifts that the heavens and earth were created. Granted, now that the heavens and earth have been created their continued existence is through the shifts of priests, but perhaps the shifts would not have been sufficient reason to have brought them into existence; for it is a greater feat to create something ex nihilo than to continue the existence of that which has already been created. So how does this memra show that the sacrificial service is so essential that the world was created and brought into being on account of it?<br>This memra also appears in Megillah 31b, and the passage there reads as follows: <i>It was said: Rabbi Ami said, if not for the shifts of priests offering sacrifices, the heavens and the earth would not continue to exist, as per the verse “If not for my covenant, I would not have established the day or night, nor even the laws of the heavens and the earth (Jeremiah 33:25)”</i>, <i>and the verse</i> “<i>And he said, Lord, G-d, how can I know that I will inherit it? (Genesis 15:8)”</i>. <i>Our father Abraham said, Master of the world! Perhaps, G-d forbid, Israel will sin before you, and you will do to them as you did to the generation of the flood and the generation of the dispersion? G-d said to him, I shall not. Abraham said, “how can I know (Genesis 15:8)?” G-d said, “Take for me three calves, etc. (Genesis 15:9).”</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “covenant made between the pieces,” which itself was a sacrifice, is understood to represent all sacrificial service.</i> This passage understands the “covenant” in Jeremiah as referring to the “covenant made between the pieces” in Genesis 15, and therefore the verse reads “If not for my covenant, i.e. the covenant made between the pieces…” And the end of the verse says “I would not have established,” so the sacrificial service must be sufficient reason for the establishment and creation of the world.<br>Should one object that this is all very well for as long as the Temple is standing, but what of when is has been destroyed? One answer is that it was the period of the Temple’s existence that G-d foresaw and which itself sufficed for him to create the world. Additionally, the passage there concludes: <i>Abraham said, Master of the world! This is all very well for as long as the Temple is standing. What will be with them when the Temple is no longer standing? G-d said to him, I have already arranged the passages dealing with sacrificial law for them. Whenever they read these passages, I will consider it as if they had brought the sacrifices before me and I will forgive all their sins</i>. <b>Rashi</b>’s commentary on Ta`anit ad loc., however, says, “This is a corrupted passage, for how do they see this?”"

                    "THE MAN [Heb. <i>ish</i>] OF SOCHO. He was the lord of a place called Socho. <i>Ish</i> here means “lord,” as in the mishna (Yoma 1:3) “<i>Ishi</i>, High Priest!” <b>Rav</b>, in his commentary there, explains <i>Ishi</i> as “my lord.” [*Cf. the mishna in Challah 4:10, s.v. <i>Ish Teko`a</i>.]",
                    "BE NOT LIKE SERVANTS SERVING THE MASTER FOR PAY. <b>Rav</b>: <i>rather, out of love alone</i>. In other words, the mishna enjoins that the service be out of love alone, for this is the truest kind of service. It does not mean to say, however, that that service for pay is forbidden, as in either case he is serving G-d; for this reason our perfect Torah did not see unfit to mention rewards and punishments. One who serves in the hopes of earning reward or avoiding pain is simply not on the level of the one who serves out of love alone, whose service has no secondary intention whatsoever.<br>And the tanna wished to enjoin us to be among those who serve out of love alone, but not to exclude one who serves in the hopes of earning reward from the category of those who serve! This is not the case, as the Sages say in Bava Batra 10b: <i>One who says, “I give this </i>sela<i> to charity that my son should live!” or “...that I should have a share in the world to come!” is perfectly righteous.</i> Furthermore, if one takes the opposite position, one cuts the very legs out from under the nation of Israel!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In rabbinic literature, in order to avoid making a damning or frightening statement about some party, one refers to said party by a name that usually denotes its opposite. Here, in order to avoid saying “one cuts the legs out from under Israel” in Hebrew, the author actually writes “one cuts the legs out from under the haters of Israel.” Cf. Sanhedrin 106a.</i> For “where is the weigher, where is the counter” (Isaiah 33:18) who shall say that so-and-so is one who truly serves out of love alone?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a societal problem, for Jewish law prescribes respect and reverence for those who are considered servants of G-d. Once only those who serve out of love alone are considered servants of God, it is impossible to determine who is and isn’t such a one, and the category has lost any legal or cultural relevance. </i> And can it be good in G-d’s eyes that anyone who serves Him with the intent that the rewards promised by the Torah itself be fulfilled—that same Torah which has been communicated to us from His mouth—that such a one not receive his good lot on account of this? It pleases not their Master that people should say thus!<br>Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi says as much in Avot 2:1: <i>Consider the loss incurred in doing a mitzvah against the reward for doing it</i>, per my explanation there. Similarly, in 2:16: <i>And you have a faithful taskmaster, who shall pay your wages</i>. Cf. what I’ve written there on <i>And you should know what reward awaits the righteous in the future</i>. And we further see that there can be nothing wrong with this from the story of Azariah the brother of Simon, related in the mishna in Zevachim 1:2.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Azariah provided for his brother Simon in order that he should have a portion of the reward for Simon’s Torah studies.</i><br>As mentioned above, the tanna of our mishna does not prohibit this, and I say that his own words prove it, which he chose with care in order that we shouldn’t misunderstand them. For why would he say “be not like servants serving the master for pay” when he could simply have said “do not serve for pay,” which would have gotten the point across to his students more succinctly? By saying “be not like servants who serve the master for pay” he taught that even those who serve for pay are servants at any rate, just that one should not be like them but greater than they, and should serve out of love alone.<br>I saw that our master <b>Maharal,</b> in his commentary on Avot, <i>Derech Chaim</i>, deals with the question of why the mishna continues and says “but rather be like servants who serve the master without thought of pay” and doesn’t simply stop at “be not like servants serving the master for pay”. He writes that had the tanna said only “be not like servants serving the master for pay” the implication would have been that he prohibits being like servants serving the master for pay, while in fact there is no such prohibition and one who does so is even completely righteous. He means only that there is a level and grade above that one, which is serving out of love alone. It is for this reason that he goes back and explicitly says “rather, be like servants etc.”, to explain that he means only that one should aspire to be a servant serving without thought of pay. All this is the opinion of <b>Maharal</b>.<br>Now you can see how this tanna has, in his wisdom and perfection, very cleverly worded his teaching. For with the first phrase he taught that one should not deny the value of those who serve for pay and that they are still called servants, and he then further clarified this by saying “rather be etc.”, i.e. I mean only that you should rather be thus, but not that it is forbidden to serve for pay; the main point is to show you the utmost level of perfection, in which you should be serving out of love alone, not to prohibit the other kind of service.<br>At this point, there is certainly no way to misunderstand the words of the tanna the way Tzadok and Baitos did, who claimed that he meant to say that there is no pay to be received at all, as <b>Rav</b> mentions in his commentary to mishna 11. Still, he should have made it completely clear to the point that whosever was listening would have understood this.<br>[*I saw that the <b>Tosafot</b> in Rosh HaShana, at the beginning of page 4a, write that our mishna discusses the case of gentiles, who tend to regret the good deed they have done if they are not rewarded for it. I find this quite odd—can it be that the tanna has decided to discuss idolaters? All the more so in tractate Avot, which collects the dicta the Sages constantly emphasized, at least according to one opinion mentioned by <b>Rav</b> above in mishna 2. And certainly Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi shouldn’t have set it down in the mishna, if these words are only concerning idolaters!<br>But I was put at ease when I saw their words in Pesachim, at the top of 8b, where they write that our mishna is discussing a case of one who will have anguish and regret over the charity he has given if whatever good thing he is hoping for doesn’t come to pass, but one who has no anguish and regret is completely righteous, and the Talmud in Rosh HaShana 4a and Bava Batra 10b seems to say as much. Accordingly, when the <b>Tosafot</b> say our mishna is discussing an idolater, they mean that simply as an example of someone who regrets having done a good deed, as the Talmud there says. But our mishna is discussing a Jew having this regret. And what they mean to say is that our mishna is discussing the case of, for example, an idolater, etc., which is to say a Jew who regrets it, just like the average idolater who regrets it.]",
                    "PAY [Heb. <i>p’ras</i>]. <b>Rav</b>: <i>this </i>[p’ras] <i>is what one gives someone who has served him, but whom he is not legally obligated to pay anything</i>, and by this he means to distinguish <i>p’ras</i> from <i>sachar</i>, for <i>sachar</i> is what one must pay by law. So also <b>Rambam</b>.",
                    "WITHOUT THOUGHT OF RECEIVING PAY. A different version of our mishna has the text “intending not to receive pay”. I cannot understand that version, for it is impossible that one should serve only on condition that he not receive pay, for the implication is that should he receive pay, he will not serve. <b>Midrash Shmuel</b> writes that the case in the first version is one who serves without declaring that he is doing so specificaly to receive pay; he is still aware that the pay will come, and does have hopes of reward. On the other hand, one who serves intending not to receive pay is one who explicitly serves not in order to receive pay but out of love alone. While this is improves matters exegetically, it doesn’t fit the language of that other version well.<br>As for his criticism of the first version, that even one who serves out of love alone still knows that the reward will eventually come, I would not call such a one someone who serves out of love; in fact, he is the archetypal servant who serves for reward! One who serves out of love alone is he who constantly finds his service insufficient and, because of his great love of G-d, feels that he has not served properly. As Hillel says in mishna 14, “And I for myself, what am I?”, according to <b>Rav</b>'s commentary ad loc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Rav</b> there: <i>even if I have accrued merit for myself, what is this merit and what is it worth when considered against what I am truly obligated to do</i>? </i> Not only does he hold no anticipation of reward, he fears for his soul lest he sin by falling short in his service, which is what the tanna intends by his last words, “and the fear of heaven should be upon you”, as I will explain.<br>This was the way of the patriarchs. Although our father Abraham was promised seed he afterwards said, “and I remain childless” (Genesis 15:2).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The author is most likely recalling <b>Ramban</b>’s commentary on that verse, which points out that although Abraham had already been promised offspring, he feared that his sins might have annulled the promise.</i> This is why G-d was called “the fear of Isaac” (Genesis 31: 42),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the one before whom Isaac feared the consequences of his sins.</i> and Jacob likewise feared that perhaps he had been sullied by sin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As per the Talmud’s exegesis in Berachot 4a on Genesis 32:8.</i> This is the portion and these are the thoughts of the servants of G-d who serve out of love alone; there is no anticipation of reward whatsoever. And so the version before us is correct—so it seems to me.",
                    "AND THE FEAR OF HEAVEN SHOULD BE UPON YOU. <b>Rav</b>: <i>one who serves out of fear will take care not to transgress a negative commandment</i>. So also <b>Rambam</b>. But according to what I wrote above, this is a part of service out of love.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosafot Yom Tov writes above that one who serves out of love is always afraid that he has not served properly.</i><br>The euphemism “heaven” for “G-d” is to indicate that this fear should not be a fear of punishment, which would yield a superficial kind of service with a hint of personal interest. The “fear” referred to here is awe of His greatness, and this is conveyed by the use of “heaven” because the heavens are where His greatness can be seen, i.e. in the creations of the heavens and all their hosts and ceaseless motions—so it seems to me."

Yehuda Lerma</b> asked why the mishna does not enjoin one to acquire students, considering that the Sages said (Ta’anit 7a): <i>I have learned much from my teachers… and from my students most of all!</i> He explained this by noting that a student’s sole desire is to learn. Students therefore study only where their hearts desire and under the teachers from whom they feel they will gain the most. So if a person cannot find anyone who wishes to study under him, the tanna does not enjoin him to. Our master, <b>Maharal</b>, writes in <i>Derech Chaim</i> that the mishna does not say “acquire a student for yourself” because it isn’t proper for a person to appoint himself a master and create honor for himself by saying “come study under me,” as people do in these lands.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., around Prague, where the Maharal was the Chief Rabbi.</i><br>Although what they say is certainly true, I don’t think the question is a good one to begin with,because this tanna’s ancient predecessors, the men of the Great Assembly, had already preceeded him in this when they said “train many students” (Avot 1:1). Now they had in mind only students interested in the teacher in question, as it is impossible to train a student against his will, and they likewise didn’t have in mind a teacher unqualified to train students, for they said <i>ha`amidu</i>, which means to stand them on their feet in truly understanding Torah, as I wrote there, and only one actually possessing truth could do this. They certainly were not speaking of arrogant individuals trying to rise to positions of power, declaring that they will rule and be powerful leaders of the people and make great academies of students, for all of their words here are words of righteousness and humility. But they did enjoin someone who is able to train many students to do so.<br>This is similar to the passage (Avodah Zarah 19b): <i>“And numerous are her slain” </i>(Proverbs 7:26)<i>—this refers to a student who has matured to the point of deciding legal questions and does not do so</i>. But one who has not arrived at that point and lords himself over others as mentioned earlier is included in “she has felled many dead” (Proverbs 7:26; Talmud ibid.). And if this is true of an inept legal decision, which usually only has consequences for the moment and only happens periodically and with relatively few people, all the more so in the case of a teacher who instructs numerous students every day, especially as the students then absorb the erroneous material for good. Of him it is most certainly said “she has felled many dead.”<br>And there is nothing objectionable about phrasing their teaching as “train many students,” with no added specifications of quality about student or teacher, for this and cases like this are an example of the verse: <i>Straight are the ways of G-d; the righteous walk in them and sinners stumble over them </i>(Hosea 14:10).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., righteous people will understand on their own that the teacher and student must possess certain requisite qualities.</i><br>What <b>Rav</b> writes, that the teacher must teach without charge, is clear from Nedarim, 4:3.

And so <b>Rashi</b> on page Ketubot 52b (s.v. <i>Ke`orchei hadayanim</i>).<br>But from the end of <b>Rav</b>’s comment it is clear that even at the beginning, where he writes “who put together and present the arguments of the litigants before the judges,” he does not mean that they themselves argue these points before the judges, but that in revealing these arguments to the litigant and saying “do such-and-such” it is as though they themselves were arguing before the judges. And this is how <b>Rashi</b> explains it in his commentary here and on Shabbat 139a (s.v. <i>‘Orchei hadayanim</i>).<br>Now <b>Rambam</b> writes: <i>“`Orchei hadayanim”—these are individuals who study legal arguments so that people should be familiar with them. They write textbooks in question-and-answer format: “When the judge says such-and-such, answer such and such,” and “when the opposing party says such-and-such, your answer should be such-and-such,” as if the litigants are before them and they are presenting </i>[Heb. <i>`orchei</i>] <i>the arguments. This is why they are called </i>`orchei hadayanim<i>, for it is as if they have presented </i>[Heb. <i>`archu</i>]<i> the arguments before them</i>. According to this reading, the word <i>`orchei</i>, “those who present,” has a hidden object, for it really means “those who present arguments before the judges.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some clarification is in order. The phrase <i>`orchei hadayanim</i> is in what is known as the construct state, a feature of Hebrew grammar in which two words <i>x y</i> are read as “the x of y.” Accordingly, <i>`orchei hadayanim</i> should be read as “the `<i>orchim</i> (non-construct plural of the singular `<i>orech</i>) of the <i>dayanim</i>.” Two interpretive questions present themselves: how to understand <i>`orchim</i>, and how to understand the sense in which these <i>`orchim</i> are “of” the <i>dayanim</i>. <b>Rashi</b> in the first approach quoted by the author understands <i>`orchim</i> as a noun meaning “laywers,” more or less, and they are “of” the <i>dayanim</i>, judges, in the sense that they stand before them. The phrase then reads “lawyers arguing before judges.” <b>Rashi</b> and <b>Rav</b> in the second approach quoted by the author differ from the first approach only in that they do not see the <i>`orchei hadayanim</i> as actually present in the courtroom. In what sense, then, are they “of the judges?” To answer this, the author explains that it is as if they have actually presented the arguments before the judges, and for this reason they are called “lawyers arguing before the judges.” <b>Rambam</b> quoted in the third approach sees <i>`orchei</i> as a participle meaning “presenting.” The Hebrew verb here is strictly transitive and as such the participle requires an object, which the <b>Rambam</b> explains as “legal arguments.” The author notes that this object must be supplied by the reader and is therefore a “hidden object,” i.e. not present in the actual phrase <i>`orchei hadayanim</i>, which is now read as “[those who are] presenting (the arguments) before the judges.” </i><br><b>Lev Avot</b> writes that he heard the following explanation: it is as if he has arranged [Heb. <i>`arach</i>] the judges themselves, for when the judges rule in one party’s favor it is because he has presented that party’s arguments, in which sense he has set up [Heb. <i>`arach</i>] the judges to issue this ruling.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I have been translating the verb <i>`arach</i> thusfar as “present.” Although it has the literal meaning “to arrange,” the equivalent English idiom has the lawyers “presenting arguments” rather than “arranging arguments.” The approach of <b>Lev Avot</b> takes the construct <i>`orchei hadayanim</i> to mean “those who arrange the judges” (see above note) or, in more idiomatic English, those who “set up” the judges.</i><br><b>Midrash Shmuel</b> writes in the name of <b>R. Matityah HaYitzhari</b>: <i>the mishna is certainly not discussing one who aids the litigant in presenting deceitful arguments, for such a one is a completely evil person. Rather, it refers even to presenting true arguments that will change the course of the proceedings, as per the passage in Ketubot 52b concerning the law of indefinite medical expenses, which are considered “sustenance” and are paid from the estate of the husband. Rabbi Yochanan advised the heirs to pay a fixed sum to a doctor, making them definite medical expenses.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By Jewish law, before marriage the husband signs a kind of pre-nuptial agreement called a <i>ketubah</i>, which specifies the husband’s obligations to the wife both during marriage and in case of divorce or death. The law dictates that a widow be allowed to choose between collecting the sum specified in her <i>ketubah</i> or receiving basic sustenance from the heirs, which she can do indefinitely until she chooses to collect the <i>ketubah</i>. Some needs, however, are not considered “sustenance” and are deducted from the sum of the <i>ketubah</i>. The question in Ketubot revolves around medical treatment. There, it is the opinion of R. Shimon ben Gamliel that indefinite medical treatment (i.e. for a chronic illness) is considered “sustenance” and must be paid out of the husband’s estate without being deducted from the sum of the <i>ketubah</i>, while definite medical treatment is not considered “sustenance” and is deducted from the sum in the <i>ketubah</i>. Some relatives of Rabbi Yochanan asked for advice concerning a case of indefinite medical treatment. He advised them to find a doctor who would be willing to care for the widow indefinitely for a fixed sum, making the treatment legally definite and therefore deductable from the sum of the <i>ketubah</i>. Rabbi Yochanan afterwards declared that he had erroneously acted like the <i>`orchei hadayanim</i>, in violation of our mishna. </i> Using this commentary, I have arrived at an understanding of what <b>Rav</b> meant when he wrote that the <i>`orchei dayanim</i> offer advice of the type “do such-and-such”. For had he meant, as <b>Rambam</b> means, that they instruct a person in which arguments to put forth, he ought to have written that they advise the person to “argue such-and-such”. I think, rather, that according to <b>Rav</b>, the prohibition is to advise him to act in some way, as in the case of Rabbi Yochanan and the widow, and the case of Rav Nachman, who advised a woman to forgo her <i>ketubah </i>in Ketubot 86a. <b>Rav</b> might agree, however, that one need not be overly pious and avoid even instruction in wording and presenting arguments. Of course, <b>Rambam</b> forbids even wording and presenting arguments.<br><b>Midrash Shmuel</b> quoting <b>Rabbenu Yonah</b>: <i>the mishna is not discussing a case of teaching one to use false arguments, for one who would do so is completely evil and this thing is a great sin, and our tractate is devoted to people interested in matters of piety. It is rather discussing a case of improving the strength and order of arguments that the litigant is already planning on using, going through how they will be received in court and showing him the anticipated outcome. The mishna says one should not do this because it will arouse suspicion.</i><br>One thing, at least, is clear according to all the commentaries, and that is the reason for the mishna’s use of the word “like” in “do not act like<i> `orchei dayanim</i>”. Had the mishna simply said “do not be <i>`orchei dayanim</i>” it would have sounded like it is actually forbidden to be an <i>`orech dayanim</i>, and it is not.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rather, it does not befit a pious person to act like they do.</i><br>I also think that the wording <i>al ta`as atzmecha</i>, literally “do not make yourself,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which we have rendered idiomatically as “do not act like.”</i> as opposed to simply <i>lo tihyeh</i>, “do not be,” is meant to reflect the point made in the abovementioned case of Rabbi Yochanan. There, the Talmud says that he offered his advice because it was his relative that consulted him, and he felt this was a case of “do not turn away from your own flesh and blood” (Isaiah 58:7). He afterwards regretted it and said “we have made ourselves like the <i>`orchei dayanim</i>” because he held that prominent rabbinic figures should not do so. The implication is that were he not a prominent rabbinic figure, he would’ve been correct in doing what he did on account of “do not turn away from your own flesh and blood.” The language of our mishna, “do not make yourself,” is making this point: because of “yourself,” i.e. because you are a prominent rabbinic figure, do not make yourself into an <i>`orech dayanim</i>; otherwise, one may do so. If this is the issue, then it follows that anyone who is not a prominent rabbinic figure may do so even for someone who isn’t a relative, and Rabbi Yochanan only quoted the verse “do not turn away from your own flesh and blood” because otherwise he simply would’ve had no reason to help one party over another, as “who can say whose blood is redder.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A play on a Talmudic phrase in Sanhedrin 74a.</i><br>To sum up, the tanna’s injunction only concerns a prominent rabinic figure, for which reason he used the language “do not make yourself.” One who is not a prominent rabbinic figure need not avoid this even as a matter of piousness, as he is not giving instruction in how to present false arguments. What we learn from the incident with Rabbi Yochanan, who had to quote the verse “do not turn away from your own flesh and blood,” is that otherwise he wouldn’t have gotten involved, not as a matter of piousness but because he had no reason to act to the benefit of one party and loss of another; whereas for a relative, as long as one is not a prominent rabbinic figure, one should act in order to uphold the verse “do not turn away from your own flesh and blood.”<br><b>Rashi</b>, however, writes ad loc.: <i>a prominent rabbinic figure is different, because people will learn from his actions and some of them will do this even for non-relatives</i>.

Work with the people for the sake of heaven when you force them to give charity or redeem captives. “And as for you, I will consider you, etc.” now means to say: just as in the case of the people, who only give to charity because the merit of their ancestors aids them, the mishna still says that their righteousness in that they gave will stand them in good stead forever, so, too, in your case.

                    "BECAUSE YOU DROWNED SOMEONE, YOU WERE DROWNED, AND THOSE WHO DROWNED YOU WILL IN THE END THEMSELVES DROWN. One might ask, if we follow the chain back to its starting point, won’t we find that the first one to have been killed did not kill anyone himself? Indeed, Abel, who was killed by Cain, hadn’t killed anyone. If so, how did Hillel know that it was on account of drowning someone else that this person had been drowned?<br>The second part of his saying, “and those who drowned you will in the end themselves drown,” is even more difficult, as this is not necessarily so! We regularly encounter cases of murderers who die in their beds at the hands of Heaven. [*I saw this question raised in Devarim Rabbah to parashat Va’Etchanan (2:25), discussing the verse “he who spills man’s blood, his blood will be spilled by man” (Genesis 9:6): <i>R. Levi said: but are there not many men who kill and yet die in their beds? They answered him: the meaning of “his blood will be spilled by man” is that when that man arrives in the future world, at that point his blood will be spilled.</i> As for the first question, concerning the first part of the mishna, I saw this mishna brought in the Talmud in tractate Sukkah 53a, and there <b>Rashi</b> explains that the body was thrown into the water and Hillel recognized him as a murderer.]<br>In <b>Rashi</b>’s commentary to our tractate, he notes that in some places people do not recite this mishna. But <b>Rambam</b>, <b>Rav</b>, and all the other commentators have it in their texts.<br><b>Midrash Shmuel</b>, in answer to the second question, explains that “in the end” in the phrase “in the end they themselves will drown” means that through reincarnation, which is an established belief not only of the Sages but also of Pythagoras [and the rest of the wise of the nations, whom <b>Abarbanel</b> mentions in his commentary to parashat Ki Tetze], he eventually will end up drowning. And he gives a rather forced answer to the first question, saying that the case of Abel is different because the Sages say that he “gazed at holiness,” and Hillel, upon seeing this skull, assumed that it was that of a murderer, and not one who “gazed,” because murder is more common than this gazing.<br>In my opinion, it is totally untenable to claim that Hillel said something that could only be understood through the doctrine of reincarnation, which is an esoteric doctrine, and which ought to be concealed from all but the select few that G-d calls upon. And Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi, the redactor of the Mishna, would not have put this dictum into our mishna. For just as a verse in the Tanakh must always be readable in its plain sense, in addition to whatever other meanings it may harbor, the words of a mishna must always be readable in the plain way that all understand. And if there were only a kabbalistic interpretation to this mishna, Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi would have left it an oral teaching, along with the other kabbalistic teachings that remained oral and were not inluded in the Mishna.<br>Besides, the mishnayot seem to be out of order. For since this is merely something that Hillel said on a particular occasion, it shouldn’t have been included among the other mishnayot, which are all of the “he used to say” type, i.e. ethical teachings that were constantly being emphasized, and should rather have been appended to the end of this series of mishnayot. All the more so since this mishna is in Aramaic and shouldn’t come between two mishnayot that are in Hebrew.<br>Also, Hillel is speaking in the second person, directing his words towards the skull itself. Why wouldn’t he have turned towards his listeners and addressed them? He should have said “because he drowned someone, he was drowned, and those who drowned him will in the end themselves drown.”<br>Also, what is the meaning of the modifier <i>af</i>—“even, also”— here?<br>It seems that the mishna intends the following. Hillel taught in the previous mishna that an unlearned person cannot be one who fears sin and so on, in order to steer people clear of personal deficiencies. He also once saw a skull, etc., and from that experience onwards he used to say “increasing the flesh only increases worms, etc.” in the next mishna, which is another list of personal deficiencies and virtues.<br>This is because when he saw this skull, he said to it, “because you drowned someone, etc.”, i.e. one would think it only logical that because you drowned someone, you were drowned, and those who drowned you will in the end themselves drown, because “the measure one uses to dole out is the one used to dole out to him” (Sotah 1:7), for this is only proper and logical. But regardless of what should be, reality contradicts this hypothesis; many people who have never killed anyone are killed and many people kill others and are not themselves killed.<br>In order to bring reality into harmony with theory, so that it doesn’t contradict the logical necessity that everything ultimately comes about through one consistent system and is judged fairly, he used to say from that moment on that “increasing the flesh only increases worms, etc.” in order to accustom people to thinking that everything is truly necessary and just. For one does find, overall, that “increasing the flesh only increases worms, etc.”, regarding defiencies, and “increasing Torah increases life, etc.”, regarding virtues. It is evident, then, that the laws in place in the world are just and perfect, and we can infer from cases that are clearly just to those whose justness is concealed, and understood only by G-d; those, too, are based on what is righteous and just, as per the verse, “For my thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor are my ways like your ways” (Isaiah 55:8).<br>It follows, then, that Hillel did not say “because you drowned someone, etc.” because he felt it was certainly true, i.e. that of necessity this is what happened and what will happen, but as a first premise, that logic would dictate that this be so. But because there are well-known cases that contradict this, and these might cause a person to say that “there is no judgement and no judge,” Hillel began to regularly propagate his teaching that “increasing the flesh only increases worms… increasing Torah increases life, etc.” among the people. The intent is that we should use our experiences and sound judgment to conclude that just as in these cases the result follows logically from the action, whether for good or ill, so also what befalls people in general follows logically, though it is beyond our understanding.<br>Since the words “because you have drowned someone, etc.” are not an absolute statement describing what will happen with certainty, as it is possible that this drowned person had not drowned anybody and that the one who drowned him might not be drowned, Hillel did not utter them as a public teaching. While facing the skull, an unhearing piece of bone, he said to himself that what ought to be is that “because you drowned someone, etc.”<br>And the fact of reality contradicting this statement is also not at all explicit, but is implicit in his following dictum, that from this point on he used to say “increasing the flesh only increases worms, etc.,” which the discerning will understand well as addressing this point. All such things ought to be said in such a manner as to be apparent to the discerning scholar but not to all those listening, lest they who will not understand the answer “decide by what their ears hear” and “judge by what their eyes see” (Isaiah 11:3) that the question is truly difficult and has no answer, and remain confounded by it and thereby falter, G-d forbid.<br>Hillel said these words in Aramaic, the language of the masses at the time per the mishna in Shekalim 5:3, because he said them as though speaking to the skull of a bandit. He also did this so that the people should take his words at face value, that it is indeed the case that “because you drowned somebody, etc.,” and for the discerning students he explained his words by affixing to them the dictum “increasing the flesh only increases worms, etc.,” which he said in Hebrew. This is what seems correct to me.",

Tosafot Yom Tov, however, understands <b>Rav</b> to be addressing the dilemma of free choice vs. predetermination the same way <b>Rambam</b> does in his introduction to Avot. He will offer a novel reading of the phrase.</i> This is the opinion of <b>Rambam</b> in chapter 8 of The Eight Chapters, his introduction to tractate Avot, where he writes that although G-d has decreed that a person must die, he has not decreed that the anyone in particular must kill him. It is the same as G-d decreeing that of those born some amount will be righteous and some evil. While this is true, it does not yield the necessary consequence that a particular evil person be evil. That individual chose of his own free will to do evil, and will therefore be punished by one of the many emissaries at G-d’s disposal. And because this individual is ready to kill and is evil,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word is חייב, which the Tosafot Yom Tov understands to mean generally “evil” as opposed to deserving punishment for some specific act, which is what the term usually means in rabbinic literature. There is some support for this reading in Talmudic Aramaic, where the cognate חייבא means “sinner” or “wicked one.”</i> the evil thing was brought about<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word is נתגלגל. This is a subtle but important reworking of the verb מגלגל in the original phrase. מגלגל is an active verb, and in the impersonal plural מגלגלין has the literal meaning “they bring about.” The sense is that the G-d, the antecedent of the omitted impersonal “they,” arranges for tragic or harmful things to come about through those who have sinned in some way, instead of coming about through innocent people. By changing it to נתגלגל, a passive verb meaning “it was brought about,” Tosafot Yom Tov is able to add the qualifying words על ידו, “through him,” to create the phrase “it was brought about through him.” The blame is now laid squarely on the person and not on G-d. Having turned חייב into “sinner” and having reworked the verb מגלגל into נתגלגל על ידו, meaning “it was brought about through him,” Tosafot Yom Tov is able to read the phrase as “an evil thing is brought about by an evil person,” meaning that those who are evil bring about evil things of their own volition, and the fact that the object of their actions deserved them is irrelevant. The statement has undergone a significant transformation: it has gone from saying that it is better that tragic things befall those who deserve them through those who have sinned to saying that men act of their own volition. </i> through him, and G-d will send him his just deserts. So also Hilchot Teshuva, 6:5.<br><b>Ramban</b> in parashat Lech Lecha attacks this doctrine at length and says that even if G-d decrees that so-and-so should harm so-and-so, and someone else goes and fulfills G-d’s decree first, he has done a good and meritorious thing. I say that even if we agree to his statement that should someone else go and do it first he has done a good and meritorious thing, it does not refute the words of <b>Rambam</b>. For the evil individual that <b>Rambam</b> was discussing did not do this evil act in order to fulfill the words of G-d, but because his wicked heart drove him to it, and G-d goes by what is in the heart.

Not because they believed that he has sensation and turned non-existent things into existing ones, but because the pain they spoke of is the pain of the dead person’s soul, which is still in existence and which beholds the disgrace of the body and is greatly pained by it; even the non-Jewish sages have agreed that the soul remains after death. This is the meaning of the verse in Job, 14:22: “Only his flesh shall pain [Heb. <i>yich’av</i>] him, and his soul mourn over him,” per <b>Ibn Ezra</b>’s commentary ad loc.: yich’av<i> here has the sense of destruction, as in “you will destroy [Heb. </i>tach’ivu<i>] every good piece of land with stones” (2 Kings 3:19). The word was borrowed for unfeeling objects, for whom destruction is like pain for a person.</i> The verse explains that the soul will indeed be in mourning on account of the pain it feels at seeing and recognizing the body in which it once was. [*And it is on the basis of this verse that one opinion in Shabbat 152b holds that as long as the flesh has not decomposed, the dead know whatever is said before them.] This is what they meant when they said that the worm is painful to the dead person, i.e. to the soul that knows of this. We can further deduce that this is what they meant because in speaking of the dead person they didn’t mention “flesh” and in speaking of the living one they said “the flesh of the living.” They should have used the same expression, saying either “like a needle in the living” or “in the flesh of the dead,” but they did not do so because they hold that the pain is felt by the dead person himself, i.e. his soul, and not his flesh, which feels nothing.<br>You shouldn’t find it odd that the soul is called <i>met</i>, “the dead,” for we find the Torah using the word this way in the verse “or one who consults the dead” (Deuteronomy 18:11), which obviously refers to the souls of the dead. Since this consultation occurs where the bodies of the dead are located it is called “consulting the dead,” even though the consultation is actually with the souls of those bodies. In our case the pain is similarly said to affect the dead, even though it is the souls that are pained, because the act that brings about the pain of the soul is done to the body. This is what seems correct to me.<br>[*I later found that <b>Kol Bo</b> writes in Hilchot Avel that the reason for burying the dead is that the soul is pained when it beholds the body in disgrace and lying about unburied, and says: <i>they had the same idea in mind when they said “the worm is as painful to the dead as a needle in the flesh of the living,” which is a parallel only in terms of the existence of pain, not what type of pain it is.</i> I also found that <b>Rashba</b> in responsum 1:369 considers it obvious that the dead do not feel the pain of the knife, and cites the embalming process as proof.]",

He renders <i>natal</i> as “He has covered,” meaning that the <i>shechina</i> covers him to save him from all manner of evil, to be a protective shade over his head. In our editions <b>Rav</b> writes this as an explanation of mishna 6.<br>I also see that <b>Midrash Shmuel</b>, in quoting <b>Rashi</b>’s commentary to our mishna, writes that he found written in <b>Rashi</b>’s commentary to mishna 6 the following: <i>“...and be silent, etc.” For he has taken for himself reward for that deed.

Joshua instituted the second blessing, and his is the first book of the Prophets. David and Solomon instituted the third blessings, and their books are the first of the Writngs.<br>The other explanation <b>Rav</b> mentions is that the three blessings correspond to Scripture, Mishna, and Talmud.

But “one who stays up at night,” even if he does not seek to remain idle, he “forfeits his life” unless he is sleeping, studying, or plying his trade—because any Torah that is not accompanied by a trade eventually turns to naught.

In his commentary to this mishna, however, <b>Midrash Shmuel</b> writes that the mishna is based on the verse “they would scrape moss from trees” (Job 30:4), which the Talmud in Chagiga 12b understands as referring to those who interrupt their Torah studies to engage in conversation. The Targum likewise translates that verse “they who abandon [inscribing] words of Torah on the tablet of their hearts for conversation.” Since this is explicit in the Targum it is considered obvious and the mishna sees no need to mention the verse, relying instead on the thinking person to understand this on his own; for the way of the tannaim is not to make explicit what they feel should have been understood. The mishna might also be midrashically interpreting the Hebrew <i>siach</i> as “tree,” as in the verse <i>vechol siach hasadeh</i> (Genesis 2:5) where the commentators understand it as “tree,” which is why the mishna’s example is one who says “how beautiful this tree is!”<br><b>Rashi</b> writes in his commentary here: <i>the text should not read “Scripture considers him,” for no verse is adduced.</i> <b>Rav</b> is likewise careful with his language and writes “they consider him as if.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">101</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“They” meaning the Sages, not a verse.</i> On the other hand, <b>Rav</b> uses the same language in the next mishna, even though it quotes the verse “only take care, etc.”<br>The reason our mishna does not say “he forfeits his life, as the verse says, etc.” as in mishna 4 and instead says “he is considered as if” is that the person in our mishna happens to interrupt his learning temporarily and immediately returns to it, whereas the person in mishna 4 “turns his mind to idle things.” <b>Midrash Shmuel</b> writes in the name of <b>R.

The third is one who does not prefer idleness over Torah study, but when some idle thing presents itself he idles and thereby gets lazy and does not review his learning, which is the case of our misha where he “sits and removes them from his heart,” i.e. through remaining idle they depart from his heart.

For our mishna is discussing his intent, not his actual deeds, and while an unlearned person cannot know what is and isn’t a sin that he should fear it, he can determine his intent and generally fear whatever it is that might be a sin. Cf. mishna 17 [s.v. <i>im ein chochma</i>].<br><b>Midrash Shmuel</b> points out the difficulty stemming from the two halves of this statement. For the first half implies that if they are at the same level his learning will not endure, whereas the second half implies that if they are at the same level his learning will endure.

[He writes in his commentary to the second half of the mishna that the decree can be fulfilled in other areas in which he can be a <i>chacham</i> outside of Torah study.] If both are at the same level then whatever was decreed will come to pass, whether he was decreed to be a <i>chacham</i> or <i>tipesh</i>.<br>He also writes that there are versions that read: <i>anyone whose fear of heaven precedes his learning, his learning will endure; anyone whose fear of heaven does not precede his learning, his learning will not endure.</i> In his commentary to the next section of the mishna he rejects this version.",

The answer is that when a person accepts upon himself to do whatever the learned tell him and not veer from their words left or right, his “deeds are greater than his learning,” for from this point on he is considered as if he had fulfilled all the laws of the Torah, since he intends to do whatever the learned person tells him. This is also clear from a passage in Avot deRabbi Natan, 22:1: “anyone whose deeds are greater than his learning”—as the verse says “we shall do and we shall hear” (Exodus 24:7), for they put “we shall do” before “we shall hear” and received reward as if they had fulfilled every commandment before they had heard of it; “anyone whose learning is greater than his deeds”—a person should not say that he will first study a law and only then keep it.</i><br>Now we understand well why the mishna uses “greater than,” for “greater than” here is just like the “precedes” of the previous section.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Per <b>Rav</b>’s explanation of the first section, cited in Tosafot Yom Tov above, that “precedes” refers to his intent to observe the laws he learns about.</i> The reason the mishna didn’t simply use “precedes” is because the deeds themselves cannot really precede the learning since he does not know of them, but the resolution to heed those commandments can. When he takes that upon himself he is resolving to do everything, which is more than he can ever learn.

Akiva wished to find merit for all men, including Noahides.<br><b>Rambam</b> says this clearly in Hilchot Melachim 8:10: <i>Moses commanded us in the name of G-d to compel all men to accept the seven commandments that the sons of Noah were commanded. Whoever does not accept them shall be executed. Such a one as accepts them is referred to as </i>ger toshav <i>in rabbinic literature… Whoever accepts the seven commandments and is careful to keep them is called one of the “pious of the nations” and has a share in the world to come. This is provided he accepts them keeps them because G-d has commanded them in the Torah and made known through Moses that the sons of Noah had previously been commanded to keep them. But if he does these things because his reason compels him he is not a </i>ger toshav <i>and is not one of the “pious of the nations,” or even </i>[the text should read “but rather”] <i>one of their wise men.<br></i>Therefore, I wonder why it is that the commentators remained so distant from this approach and did not want to use it to explain the words of R. Akiva as applying to all men, limiting them instead to Jews alone. They drew support from the passage in the Talmud (Yevamot 61a), “you are called ‘man’, etc.”, stacking one midrashic reading on top of another!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">117</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The passage in Yevamot 61a is a midrashic reading of the word “man” in a verse in Ezekiel, and to assume that our mishna is using the word “man” to mean Jews only is likewise a midrashic reading; the end result, therefore, is midrashically reading “man” in our mishna based on further midrashically reading “man” in Ezekiel.</i> Because of this they had to contrive a forced understanding of the “image” and the verse that our mishna brings as proof.<br>In my opinion, the following approach is the spacious, paved road. R. Akiva intends to instruct all men as we were commanded to do by Moses, per <b>Rambam</b> above. If that command extends to threats of destruction by the sword, it certainly includes persuasive speech intended to draw them to the will of their Maker. He speaks well of them and says that they are beloved in that they are created “in the image” in order to show them that the law of man is to keep the statutes and laws of G-d, as <b>Rambam</b> says. For since man is beloved of G-d, to the point that they he was created in His image, he must do the will of his maker, as <b>Rashi</b> writes.<br>Now we understand why the mishna chooses this verse, despite the fact that there are several similar verses that precede it, for instance “Let us make man in Our image.” For this verse is the only one that is given as a rationale for a commandment; when G-d commands Noah and his sons not to kill, he gives the reason “because G-d has made man in His image,” and R. Akiva is speaking to the Noahides as well.<br>We also understand why here the mishna says “in the image” and leaves out the verse’s descriptor “of G-d”, but later in the section about “children” it says “they were called children of G-d”, for this is a rebuke to the nations. They were created “in the image,” i.e. “in the image of G-d”, but only created such—since they do not keep the commandments, or if they do keep them they do not do so because G-d commanded them, they cannot be described as being “in the image of G-d”.<br>This also accords with the idea of “the image,” which <b>Rambam</b> has explained in the Guide for the Perplexed 1:1 as referring to the intellect that is unique to man and is his true essence. The purpose of this intellect is to know G-d to the extent it is possible and within man’s abilities. This truly wise sage chose his words cleverly and did not say that they are “in the image of G-d,” for they are lacking knowledge of G-d, and when the verse says that He “made man in the image of G-d” it means that this was the intent of the creation of man, i.e. that he have the kind of intellect which can reach knowledge of G-d. Since, however, the reality is that “they neither know nor understand, they go about in darkness” (Psalms 82:5) and the potential has not been actualized, it is only fitting that the mishna say they were created “in the image” and not “in the image of G-d”, since the intended knowledge of G-d was not achieved and they are left only with potential, which is fittingly called simply “the image.” This seems to be the explanation of R. Akiva’s words.<br>Based on this, we can see that the following mishna has chosen its language very carefully, as I will explain there.<br>Also, this is another facet of why Israel is “especially beloved”—for they are already beloved to G-d as part of mankind, which He made in His image, and they are still more beloved, “foremost in rank and foremost in honor” (Genesis 49:3), on account of two other things: they are children of G-d, which is the “rank” as it is a great virtue, and they possess the desirable utensil, the Torah, which is “honor,” as in “G-d will give his nation honor” (Psalms 29:11) [*which verse the Sages have expounded in the Talmud, Zevachim 116a as referring to the Torah].",
                    "AS THE VERSE SAYS, “YOU ARE THE CHLIDREN OF HASHEM, YOUR G-D” (Deuteronomy 14:1). The mishna does not cite the earlier verse “Israel is my firstborn son” (Exodus 4:22) because one might interpret that verse as referring only to that generation, which G-d desired to bring out of Egypt and called “my children.” The mishna therefore cites this verse, which was said in the context of the commandments that we have been commanded to keep forever, laws that never pass: “Do not cut yourselves, etc.” These are “obligations of the body,” which apply in every place and in every generation.<br><b>Midrash Shmuel</b> explains in the name of <b>Chasid Ya’avetz</b> that the mishna chooses this verse because only in it does G-d tell Israel themselves that they are “His children,” as the verse says “you are the children.” In the earlier section of the mishna, concerning “the image of G-d,” He likewise tells the people themselves. This is also the case in the next section, with the verse “for I have given you a good teaching.” This explanation accords well with <b>Rambam</b>’s understanding of “made known to them.” According to <b>Rav</b>, however, who does not explain “made known to them” literally, instead understanding it as “clear to all,” the mishna does not bring proof from the fact that the verse speaks to the people and means simply that this is something clear and well-known to all people. In that case, my approach<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">118</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That this verse was chosen because it refers to all generations.</i> works better.",
                    "DESIRABLE UTENSIL [Heb. <i>k’li chemda</i>, lit. “desired utensil”]. This is the Torah, which is called <i>chemda</i>, for shortly after the verse “the Torah of G-d is perfect” (Psalms 19:8) comes the verse “which are more desirable [Heb. <i>nechmadim</i>] than gold, even much fine gold” (Psalms 19:11)—so <b>Midrash Shmuel</b> in the name of <b>R. Yisrael</b>.<br>I say that the mishna calls it a <i>k’li chemda</i> because through it the world was created, and the word <i>chemda</i> describes the creation of the world. For in the <i>sh’moneh esreh</i> for Shabbat the Sages wrote “you have called it<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">119</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbat.</i> the <i>chemda</i> of days,” based on the Targum Yerushalmi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">120</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><b>Abarbanel</b> quotes this Targum ad loc., as do others, but it is not in our editions.</i> which translates the word <i>vayechal</i>, “and He completed” (Genesis 2:2) with the Aramaic <i>vechamed</i>. The idea is that the finished creation in its entirety was desirable in His eyes, for which reason He also said it was “good”. This is what <b>Rav</b> is referring to when he writes that the “good teaching” refers to creation, which is also “good”.<br>Since “good” refers more naturally to physical things and “desirable” is closer to intellectual things—as it is the soul which desires—the mishna does not call it the “good utensil” after the “good” of creation but the “desirable utensil.” This point is made clear in the verse “...that the tree is good for eating… and desirable for understanding” (Genesis 3:6), where “good” is said of the physical, of eating, while “desirable” is said of understanding."

For this reason the mishna does not open with the words “he used to say,” as it is a direct continuation of the preceding mishna, in which “beloved is man, etc.” was said of all the nations of the world in order to instruct them and draw them to the commandments they were commanded in, as I wrote above. Our mishna now proceeds to call on all people, Jew and gentile, and warn them that “all is seen… and the world is judged well.”",
                    "ALL IS SEEN, AND PERMISSION IS GIVEN. <b>Rav</b> in the name of <b>Rambam</b>: <i>“all is seen”—all of a person’s deeds, what he has done and what he will do, are known to Him. And say not that since G-d knows all that a person will do he is forced to do everything he does, whether for good or for evil, because “permission is given.”</i> For G-d’s knowledge is not like ours, and although we use the same word to speak of His “knowledge” and our knowledge it is nothing more than a borrowed term. Just as we are unable to know the true nature of His existence, as the verse says, “Can you achieve an understanding of God? Can you fathom the extent of the Almighty?” (Job 11:7), we are unable to understand the nature of His knowledge. For He and His knowledge are one, unlike man and his knowledge, which are two separate things. This is what the prophet means when he says “for my thoughts are not your thoughts” (Isaiah 55:8)—these are the words of <b>Rambam</b> at the end of the eight chapters that he appended as an introduction to this tractate. They are repeated in Mishne Torah, in the fifth chapter of Hilchot T’shuva, and appear yet again in the Guide for the Perplexed, 3:20, where he writes about this at length.<br>[*<b>Ra’avad</b> writes in a gloss on Hilchot T’shuva 5:5: <i>this author has not followed the ways of the wise, for a person should not begin a thing he does not know how to complete. He began with questions and difficulties, left the difficulties unanswered, and advised the reader to just go back to faith; it were better to leave the matter simple for the simple people and not to draw their attention to this and leave them in doubt. For they might later think heretical thoughts about this. </i>I say that he has, in fact, followed the ways of the wise, the wise being the Sages, who said just the kind of incomplete things that <b>Ra’avad</b> criticized <b>Rambam</b> for. For the mishna in Chagiga 2:1 plainly says as much: <i>anyone who looks into these four things would be better off not having come into this world: what is above, what is below, what is in front, and what is behind.</i> I see no difference between the words of the tannaitic sage and the words of <b>Rambam</b>. For when the tanna says that such a person “would be better off not having come into this world” he is forbidding him to look into and research these things. Why would he do this? Hasn’t he made people aware of this issue? By <b>Ra’avad</b>’s reasoning he should’ve remained silent lest people think heretical thoughts. Should one deflect and say that this is actually what the tanna’s words mean, i.e. that he shouldn’t think heretical thoughts, one can similarly deflect and say that this is what <b>Rambam</b> meant, for he has told us that we cannot understand this and we therefore should not think of it as we will not gain understanding.<br>I say that in saying “all is seen and permission given” our tanna means to say that both things are true, as <b>Rambam</b> writes in his commentary. Now it would seem that the tanna should’ve reversed the order and said “permission is given and all is seen,” i.e. “permission”, which is free will, is given to man, and no action goes unaccounted for because it is seen and known to Him and He will reward and punish. For free will is the foundation of the entire Torah, and because of our free will G-d’s knowledge of our actions will then lead to reward or punishment. But there seems to be no logic in first saying that “all is seen,” for what difference does it make to us that “all is seen” if we do not yet know that “permission is given”? We must conclude, therefore, that the tanna’s intent is to bring to people’s attention that even though “all is seen,” there is no contradiction to free will, for “permission is given.” In formulating the mishna this way the tanna has brought up the issue and yet has offered no resolution, the expectation then being that one understand that there is none, as is clear from the fact that the mishna does not offer any. In any case, since we have shown that the mishna is to be understood as saying “even though all is seen, permission is given,” the tanna clearly does bring up the issue hidden in his words.<br>I also found a passage in Bereshit Rabbah 22:10 on Cain’s murder of Abel: <i>R. Shimon bar Yochai said: this is difficult to say and impossible for the mouth to explain. This is like two fighters who were standing and fighting in front of the king. If the king wanted to, he could have separated them, but he did not want to separate them. One of them overcame the other and killed him, and he said, Who will seek out justice for me from the king? So too, “your brother’s blood cries out to me from the earth”. </i>This is just like <b>Rambam—</b>R. Shimon bar Yochai points out that the king could have separated them, for he knew and saw that they were fighting, and does not answer why it is that he didn’t separate them, noting only that “this is difficult to say and impossible for the mouth to explain”; even so, the sage, the G-dly tanna R. Shimon bar Yochai, did not hold back from bringing up the issue.<br>As for why R. Shimon bar Yochai did not say this about the earlier sin of Adam, it might be because the story of Cain and Abel hints to the notion of free will. For they correspond to the two drives on which free will hinges: the drive for good and the drive for evil, as <b>Rambam</b> writes in the Guide for the Perplexed, 2:30.<br>The overall point is that <b>Rambam</b> spoke well and followed the ways of the wise and perfect, the G-dly tannaim.]<br><b>Midrash Shmuel</b> writes that there is no difficulty to begin with, because G-d’s knowledge is like that of one who looks and observes the deed a person does. One person simply seeing what another is doing does not force the other person to do so, and G-d seeing a person’s deeds does not force him to do them. And there are no grounds to object that since He knows what a person will do, the person must be forced to do those things, because for G-d there is no before and after, as He does not exist in time. He writes that <b>R. Moshe Almosnino</b> writes that this is the opinion of <b>Rambam</b> himself. When he distinguishes between G-d’s knowledge and our knowledge he means this distinction: His knowledge is always in the present, as there is no future in relation to Him, and just as our knowledge of the present does not force anything to happen in the present, His constant knowledge of the present does not force anything to happen in the present. People are confused on this point because they cannot imagine how He could constantly know in the present even things that are, in relation to us, in the future. <b>Rambam</b> therefore establishes that His knowledge is not like our knowledge, and we should not err this way. This is also why the mishna says “everything is seen,” i.e. already known, for everything is revealed before Him and He does not look into the future.<br>[You should know <b>Midrash Shmuel</b>’s opinion that G-d knows things as one who observes the deeds that a person does is the answer given by the <b>Ra’avad</b> in the gloss quoted earlier, where he says that G-d’s knowledge is like the knowledge of the astrologers, etc. The gloss ends, however, with “and all this does not satisfy me.” You should further know that the <b>Ra’avad</b> was likewise preceded in this opinion by <b>R. Sa`adiah Gaon</b> in his book <i>Emunot VeDe`ot</i>, in the fourth treatise, where he writes something very similar. That will do for now.]<br><b>Maharal</b> writes in <i>Derech Chaim</i> that the mishna says “is seen” instead of “sees” because even evil things that G-d does not desire are also seen. Saying “sees” would imply that He wishes to see them, and conerning evil things the verse says “and you cannot look upon wrongdoing” (Habakkuk 1:13).",

He is simply explaining why the mishna uses <i>rov</i> instead of <i>godel</i>.

Moshe Alashkar</b> that some versions have “and the world is judged with goodness but not by the majority of deeds.” He goes on to explain that the world is judged with goodness, with the attributes of kindness and mercy, but not by the majority of people’s deeds, for if He would look at the majority of deeds the world would be destroyed and cease to exist.<br>You should know that even so, a person is given the just deserts of all his deeds, for “if one says that G-d lets things go, his innards will be let go” [Bava Kamma 50a]. G-d judges the world with goodness in order that it not be destroyed and cease to exist, and “collects what is owed” at the points that He, whose memory is eternal, determines.

The tanna does not mean to say that one is a prerequisite for the other and must precede it in time, for if so neither would exist. For if each requires the other to exist first for its own existence, since they cannot both be first neither would come into being. And besides, <i>derech eretz</i> certainly must precede Torah chronologically, as I wrote on 2:2. The tanna simply means that if one does not study Torah, when he does business he won’t deal properly with others because he will not know what to do, along the lines of what the Sages said in the Talmud, Bava Kamma 30a: “one who wishes to be pious should study the laws of torts and commerce.” Similarly, one who does not do business properly with others will eventually forget his Torah for the sin of profaning G-d’s name, as people will say “Look at this Torah scholar and how disgusting his behavior is!” [Yoma 86a.]",

Here, we can explain the mishna as follows. “If there is no wisdom,” even if a person wishes to be one who fears sin, his fear of sin cannot be realized because he doesn’t know what is a sin that he should avoid it, as in 2:9, “an unlearned person cannot be one who fears sin.” And “if there is no fear of sin,” i.e. a person does not intend to be one who fears sin, then “there is no wisdom,” i.e. his wisdom does not remain with him as in mishna 9.<br>In light of our explanation, we can see that this section of the mishna is parallel to the one that precedes it. For in the first part of the first section, the subject of the protasis—Torah—brings about the existence of the subject of the apodosis—<i>derech eretz</i>; in the last part of the first section, the subject of the protasis—<i>derech eretz</i>—ensures the continued existence of the subject of the apodosis—Torah. The same is true of the second section. In the first part, the subject of the protasis—wisdom—brings about the existence of the subject of the apodosis—fear of heaven; in the last part, the subject of the protasis—fear of heaven—ensures the continued existence of the subject of the apodosis—wisdom. Similarly, erudition brings about the existence of understanding, for without erudition there is nothing to understand; understanding ensures the continued existence of erudition, for without understanding, one’s erudition turns to naught. Similarly, flour brings about the existence of Torah, as maintenance of the body certainly must chronologically precede the intellection of the soul; the Torah ensures the continued existence of the flour, for if there is no Torah he will be punished and lack for flour until he starves to death. This explanation and this version of the text seem best.<br>Some editions have, in the first part of this section, “if there is no fear, etc.,” and we can say that this is because fear of sin has a virtue over and is more important than wisdom, for the purpose of wisdom is to have fear of sin. But then we have difficulty with the fourth section, where the first part says “if there is no flour, etc.” in place of the expected “if there is no Torah, etc.” <b>Maharal</b> resolves this in <i>Derech Chaim</i> by saying that since the tanna has already placed Torah first in the first section he does not wish to do so again, for which reason he also does not put the last section right after the first.

Surrounding it are several celestial spheres, containing different planets and stars, which revolve around the earth from east to west. The sun, by contrast, has its own celestial sphere which moves from west to east. In addition, while the other celestial spheres complete their orbits around the earth daily, the sun moves incrementally and only completes its orbit every 365 days. The position of the sun in its sphere is divided into four quarters, their starting points corresponding to the solstices and equinoxes, which rabbinic literature calls <i>tekufot</i>. The act of intercalation is called <i>`ibur</i>, a word of unclear etymology. Numerous medieval commentators unterstand it as deriving from the word <i>me`uberet</i>, “pregnant” in the Mishna and Talmud. <b>R. Avraham bar Chiyya</b>, the 11th-century philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, offers an additional etymology based on <i>`avar</i>, the Biblical and Rabbinic Hebrew “passed”, explaining that the Sages take a month that has already passed and make it pass by again (<i>Sefer Ha`ibur</i>, ed. Filipowski, <i>Ma’amar Sheni, Sha`ar Shelishi</i>). Tosafot Yom Tov here offers a different etymology, making the verb <i>le`aber</i> a denominative deriving from the noun <i>`evron</i>, “a passing”, referring to the point at which the sun passes from one quarter of the sphere into the next. Tosafot Yom Tov seems to be conjecturing that the term was current in the Mishnaic and Talmudic periods, as it does not actually appear in Talmudic or subsequent astronomical literature. I have not made an exhaustive survey, but it appears that this etymology is original to Tosafot Yom Tov. </i> as <b>Rav </b>writes on the mishna in Sahnedrin 1:2 (s.v. <i>bishlosha</i>), that the court must intercalate [Heb. <i>me`abrin</i>] on account of the <i>tekufah.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">126</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This connects <i>`ibur</i> to the <i>tekufah</i>.</i> Although leap years are now added based on a fixed formula and there is no longer a need for this, in the times of R.

This explanation also encounters difficulties, because <i>tekufot</i> certainly means the path of the stars and their orbit, not arithmetic. His proof from “to be <i>choshev</i> the <i>tekufot</i>” actually proves the exact opposite, that <i>tekufah</i> is not <i>cheshbon</i>!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">129</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For if it were, the verb and its object would be redundant, along the lines of “calculating calculations”.</i> Also, how could the mishna call these <i>parpra'ot</i> when in fact they come before the meal?

It, along with the geometry which precedes it, are appetizers that draw a person to that wisdom beyond which no greater wisdom lies for man: theology. For from a knowledge of the spheres of the heavens he will come to know the Creator, who is the one who “rides the heavens” (Deuteronomy 33:26)—from knowing what is ridden one comes to know the rider. Even according to the explanations of <b>Rashi</b> and <b>Rav</b> that <i>gimatriot</i> refers to alphanumerical calculations, we can say that “for wisdom” means “for theology,” because <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> and similar works make extensive use of alphanumeric values, words read as acronyms, and permutations of the letters of a word. Based on this, we can also say that the tanna perhaps intended both things at the same time: <i>tekufot</i> are appetizers for human wisdom that can be attained through reasoning and investigation, and <i>gimatriot</i> are appetizers for our received theology."

What he means to say is that the wise man should not take pride in his wisdom, unless [Heb. <i>ki im</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">130</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew can mean “only in” or “only if”, the latter rendered here as “unless”.</i> it be to understand and know Me; the strong man should not take pride in his strength, unless it be to understand and know Me; the rich man should not take pride in his riches, unless they be to understand and know Me. Our tanna therefore asks “which is the wise person” and so on as a question in response to the verse—since the verse says that there are wise, strong, and rich people that can take pride in their accomplishments but does not specify who they are, we must now ask to whom the verse refers.<br>The tanna has investigated the matter and found that the wise person in question is the one who learns from every man. <b>Rav</b> explains that this shows that his intent in acquiring wisdom is purely for the sake of Heaven, which would be precisely in order to “understand and know Me.” The strong man is he who subdues his desires. This is strength for the sake of Heaven, i.e. in order that one not sin before G-d, and there can be no greater “understanding and knowing Me,” as the purpose of this “knowing” is to fear G-d and keep his commandments. And the rich man who is satisfied with his lot and does not chase after wealth uses his time to engage in the service of Heaven, which is also “understanding and knowing Me.” The mishna therefore says of him “you are praiseworthy in this world, and it will go well for you in the next.” And the Talmud says in Berachot 8a that “whoever eats the fruits of his labor is greater than one who fears Heaven” for the same reason: one who has fear of Heaven but is not content with what he has and chases after wealth will not have time for the service of G-d.",

If he were to be buried and not eaten by any worms, that would be best. Not only that, we find the Sages mentioning people whom the worms did not touch (Bava Batra 17a) and, we find the story of R.

The import of the story is that worms only eat bodies that were engaged in sin, and it is possible to hope to be sinless and therefore not subject to worms.</i><br>I say that what caused the commentators all this difficulty is their understanding of the word <i>tikvah</i> as coming from the root <i>k.v.h</i>, meaning “to hope”.

                    "AND POINTLESS OATHS [Heb. <i>shvuat shav</i>]. <b>Rav</b> writes in his second explanation: <i>the tanna calls a false oath a pointless oath</i>. This is based on the Talmud, Shevuot 20b, where Rav Dimi says in the name of R. Yochanan that a pointless oath is when one swears that he has eaten or not eaten, and the opposite is true. <b>Rashi</b> ad loc. explains: shav<i> here means “nothing”, as in the verses “cords of nothingness [Heb. </i>chavlei shav<i>]” (Isaiah 5:10) and “I have struck your children for nothing [Heb. </i>leshav<i>]” (Jeremiah 2:30); in this instance, as well, the oath has left his mouth for nothing. The souce for the prohibition is “Do not mention the name of Hashem, your G-d, in vain [Heb. </i>leshav<i>]” (Exodus 20:7).</i><br>I first wondered at this, because the mishna in Shevuot 3:8 asks “What is an oath of <i>shav</i>?” and does not list the case of one who makes an oath about past events. We can answer this as follows. The Talmud there says that Ravin disagrees with Rav Dimi and calls the oath of “I have eaten/I haven’t eaten” a false oath [*see my comments on Temurah 1:1, s.v. <i>sofeg</i>], while a pointless oath is one that involves an obviously false claim, such as “this is a woman” of a man. He holds that one who makes a false oath receives lashes, and the Talmud traces the source for this to the double use of the word <i>shav</i> in the verse in Exodus 20:7: one <i>shav</i> indicates that a pointless oath incurs lashes; the second <i>shav</i>, which now seems unnecessary, indicates that even a false oath incurs lashes. How, the Talmud asks, does Ravin know that a false oath is about a past event? It answers that, since the Torah clearly compares the false oath to the pointless oath, it is reasonable to assume that just as the pointless oath concerns a past event, a false oath concerns a past event. <b>Rashi</b> ad loc. explains that a pointless oath is about a “past event” because it makes a claim that is obviously false, as opposed to an oath about doing or not doing something in the future.<br>We can similarly say that Rav Dimi would agree that any oath about a past event would follow logically from the classic case of a pointless oath, which is making an obviously false claim. Because the term “pointless oath” refers most directly to an oath claiming the opposite of what is well-known, the mishna defines a pointless oath as “making an oath claiming the opposite of something well-known,” but indeed, any false oath concerning a past event would be included in this.<br>[*But there is a simpler approach. The Talmud says there (Shevuot 21b) that one who makes the oath “I have/haven’t eaten” is obligated to bring a sacrifice of atonement, whereas the abovementioned mishna says that one who makes a pointless oath is not obligated to bring a sacrifice. For this reason, the end of that same mishna says “this is the ‘pointless oath’ which one who makes intentionally must receive lashes for, but for which one who makes it unintentionally need not bring a sacrifice,” and the Talmud says that “this” means to exclude the case of “I have/haven’t eaten” which would require a sacrifice, as I wrote on that mishna (Shevuot 3:8, s.v. <i>zo hi</i>). Now even though the Talmud was in the middle of defending Ravin’s position, it is clear that even Rav Dimi agrees to this detail, as the Talmud says in Shevuot at the beginning of page 21a that Rav Dimi holds that swearing “I have/haven’t eaten” falsely would obligate one to bring a sacrifice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">153</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is why that mishna could not include the case of swearing about a past event in the “pointless oath”, even though it actually is—the mishna means to list those pointless oaths that would not obligate one to bring a sacrifice, and a false oath about a past event, even though it is included in the category of pointless oaths, does obligate one to bring a sacrifice.</i>]<br><b>Midrash Shmuel</b> writes in the name of <b>R. Yosef ibn Shoshan</b> that our mishna mentions pointless oaths and not false oaths because even when the law requires an oath and the one swearing is telling the truth, such an oath is considered a pointless oath as far as the litigant is concerned because he knows what is true, and making a true oath of something that is already known is called a pointless oath. If so, our mishna would be following the opinion of those who argue with Rav Dimi and hold that “I have/haven’t eaten” goes in the category of false oaths, which are forbidden by “do not swear falsely in My name” (Leviticus 19:12).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to <b>Midrash Shmuel</b>, the mishna's warning is not that involvement in court cases will cause one to swear falsely. It is rather that even the legitimate oaths one makes in court have a dimension of pointlessness to them, and so our mishna is discussing piously refraining even from legitimate oaths as opposed to refraining from truly transgressing any prohibitions. If so, <i>shav</i> refers exclusively to these somewhat “pointless” oaths and not to any truly problematic ones, and cannot include false oaths. As such, it cannot be following the opinion of Rav Dimi, according to whom the word <i>shav</i> includes false oaths about past events; it must be following the opinion of those who argue and hold that the word <i>shav</i> simply means “pointless”, and can therefore be borrowed to describe these somewhat pointless oaths.</i> <b>Rambam</b> follows this opinion in Hilchot Shevuot 1:3.

This is because the initial <i>mem</i> is a prefix and the first letter of the triliteral root has been ellided,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">191</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The root of <i>makach</i> being <i>l.k.ch</i>, of <i>masa`</i> being <i>n.s.`</i>, and of <i>matan</i> being <i>n.t.n.</i></i> so the second letter in the word has been geminated to compensate. One may therefore only vocalize the word with a <i>patach</i>, but not a <i>segol</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">192</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gemination refers to the doubling of a consonant. <i>Mikach</i>, properly, is <i>mikkach</i>. In order for the <i>kuf</i> to be doubled, it must become the end of a closed syllable, i.e. it must now close the syllable that precedes in—formerly just <i>mi</i>, now to be <i>mik</i>—in addition to being the first letter in the next syllable, <i>kach</i>. If the vowel of the first syllable were a long vowel such as <i>tzeireh</i> (making the word <i>mekkach</i>) the consonant following it would have to be vocalized with a <i>shva na`</i>, making the word <i>mek’kach</i>. Geminated consonants, however, are not pronounced as two separate consonants with a vowel inbetween but as one long one, as in Italian <i>libretto</i>. Of the five short vowels, three are acceptable for vocalizing the prefixed <i>mem</i>: <i>patach</i>, <i>chirik</i>, and <i>segol</i> (the other two only appear in pariticipial prefixes, while our <i>mem</i> is a noun (or verbal noun) prefix). It is unclear what rule Tosafot Yom Tov is referring to when he says that <i>segol</i> is unacceptable here, although it is true that <i>segol</i> almost never appears before a geminated consonant, coming only before suffixes like <i>-nu</i>.</i>",

It instead puts together the sets of miracles done for the Jews, which makes the ten miracles by the sea precede the ten plagues brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt. This is problematic, because both the question and the answer come from <b>Midrash Shmuel</b>, who is clearly asking a different question: since the miracles (at least in Egypt) were precisely in being saved from the plagues, the mishna should have first mentioned the plagues and then the miracle of being saved from those plagues. He answers that since the miracles are what distinguished between the Jews and the Egyptians they come first in the mishna.<br>Perhaps Tosafot Yom Tov rejected the possibility of the plagues coming first in the mishna out of hand for a different reason: the mishna primarily wishes to speak in praise of G-d, as the mishnayot before and after it do, for which reason the miracles would certainly come first (in fact, <b>Midrash Shmuel</b>'s version of the mishna did not even mention the plagues; he cites “other versions” of this mishna as mentioning the plagues and then presents his question and answer). Since, however, the mishna mentions the plagues as well, it should pair the miracles and plagues that occurred at the same time, and not pair the miracles on the one hand and the plagues on the other hand in a way that unnecessarily violates the chronological order of events.

                    "OUR ANCESTORS TRIED G-D WITH TEN TRIALS IN THE DESERT. Even though the Golden Calf was a sin it is called a “trial” because the notion of a “trial” of G-d is doubt and lack of faith in Him, and the sin of the calf was that they did not believe and trust in Him that they would go securely on their way in the desert through which He had guided them from Egypt until that point.<br><b>Rav</b> does not list them chronologically, putting them in pairs instead. But there is difficulty with <b>Rav</b> saying that the trial at their “ascent from the sea” was that of “and they came to Marah” (Exodus 15:23)—how can this be called “ascent from the sea” when it happened three days after they had crossed? And <b>Rambam</b>, whose commentary <b>Rav</b> is quoting here, does not say that the trial at Marah had anything to do with the ascent from the sea.<br>The Talmud in Arachin 15a, when it says that one of the ten trials was at the ascent from the sea, explains that this trial occurred immediately upon their ascending from the sea: “They said: just as we have ascended at this point, so have the Egyptians ascended at some other point!” And the Talmud quotes the verse “And they rebelled at the sea, at the Red Sea”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">202</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have translated <i>yam suf</i> as “Red Sea” in deference to convention. It is actually uncertain which sea <i>yam suf</i> was.</i> (Psalms 106:7) in support of this. The Talmud’s count, despite this addition, is balanced by the omission of the trial of the “complainers”.<br>But why, indeed, does the Talmud not count the complainers? It seems that the Talmud understood the “complainers” (Numbers 11:1) and the “rabble” (Number 11:4) to have been one thing—even though G-d sent fire upon them they were not quieted, “and the rabble in [the nation’s] midst etc.” This is why the verse says that they “went back and wept,” for they returned to the initial complaint of the “complainers”. This accords with the Talmud in Shabbat 116a: <i>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says: in the future, this section </i>[“And when the ark traveled” (Numbers 10:35), which the Talmud is discussing there]<i> will be removed from here and written in its proper place. Why was it written here? To provide a pause between the first story of punishment and the second. What is the second story of punishment? “And the people were like complainers” (Numbers 11:1). The first story of punishment is “And they travelled from the mountain of G-d [Heb. </i>vayis`u mehar Hashem<i>]” (Numbers 10:33), as R. Chama bar Chanina said, for they turned away from G-d [Heb. </i>saru me'acharei Hashem<i>].</i> <b>Tosafot</b> raise the question that the text still ends up putting two stories of punishment adjacent to one another, and offer a very forced answer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">203</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is unclear which Tosafot is being referred to, as our editions of the Talmud do not have Tosafot raising this question.</i> But according to what I wrote earlier, this is precisely the point the Talmud is making: that the “complainers” and the “rabble” are just parts of one story of punishment.<br>We can show this as follows. For the Talmud there asks “what is the second story of punishment” but does not first ask “what is the first story”, from which we can infer that the Talmud had an idea of what the first story was. And when the line “the first story of punishment is ‘And they travelled from the mountain of G-d’” following that was subsequently put into the text it was not phrased as a question, “what is the first story of punishment”, for it was the redactor of the text who was clarifying for us what the first story was, but the question as it was originally asked in the study hall was only concerning the second story. For the original assumption in the question was that the “complainers” were complaining about the amount of Torah they had learnt at the mountain of G-d—see below—and there is no break in the text [between the punishment of the “complainers” and the punishment of the “rabble”]. The Talmud answers by saying that the second punishment is actually that of the “complainers”, and the entire succeeding text, including the story of the “rabble”, is one long story of punishment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">204</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And the first story is the separate story of their travelling away from the mountain of G-d.</i><br>This is unlike <b>Rashi</b>’s approach, that the Talmud answers that the story of the “rabble” is the first story of punishment, which had started after they turned away from G-d. <b>Tosafot</b> there already take issue with his approach and quote the Midrash Vayechulu saying that the first punishment is that they turned away from G-d because they had learned much Torah at Sinai, like a child running out of school.<br>[*I found support for this in Midrash Rabbah on parashat Metzora (Vayikra Rabbah 18:4), which asks why Israel was punished with the afflictions of emissions and leprosy and quotes several amoraic opinions. One of them is that of R. Yehudah berabbi Shimon who says that they come from the “complainers”, for the verse there says “until it comes out of your noses and becomes nauseating [Heb. <i>lezara</i>] to you” (Numbers 11:20): “What is <i>zara?</i> It will be <i>zorna</i> and <i>bisna</i> for you.” <b>Matnot Kehuna</b> there explains in the name of <b>Aruch</b> that these are types of swelling and boils. And numerous other amoraim there explain <i>lezara</i> as somehow referring to such things. Now if the “complainers” and the “rabble” were not both part of the same story, how could the midrash say that the source is from the “complainers” and proceed to bring a proof from “it will become nauseating to you”, a verse that was said in the story of the “rabble”? It must be that the whole thing is one story, and this is a strong proof of my position.<br>Also, I say that the plain meaning of the verses indicates as much, for the text says “and the rabble… went back and wept”, and the meaning of “went back” is that they went back to what they had already been doing. And otherwise, what is the purpose of writing that they “went back” altogether? This is also a clear proof.]<br>For <b>Rambam</b> and <b>Rav</b>, who see the “complainers” and “rabble” as two separate trials, one might say that they hold like Rabbi in that passage in Shabbat 116a who says that the section “and when the ark travelled” is in its proper place and does not see it as a break between two stories of punishment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">205</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He must hold, in general, that there is no need for a break between two stories of punishment. The stories of the “complainers” and the “rabble” can then also be seen as two stories, even though there is no break between them.</i> and the mishna in Yadayim 3:5 goes according to Rabbi. In any case, I feel that the Golden Calf should not be included in this count at all,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">206</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If we follow <b>Rav</b> and <b>Rambam</b>’s position of counting the “complainers” and the “rabble” as two, we cannot also include the trials at the ascent from the sea and at Marah as two separate trials—as Tosafot Yom Tov has shown they are—for then the count comes to eleven. Tosafot Yom Tov proposes deleting the sin of the Golden Calf from the list of trials and preserving the trials at the ascent from the sea and Marah as separate ones.</i> for it is a sin, not a trial. In its stead I would count what the Talmud says in Arachin based on the verse “and they rebelled at the sea, at the Red Sea”.

                    "TEN THINGS WERE CREATED AT THE DUSK OF THE SABBATH, AND THEY ARE: THE MOUTH OF THE EARTH, ETC. <b>Rambam</b>: <i>the Sages do not believe that G-d’s will is renewed every moment. Rather, when He first created things he made their natures such that whatever should happen to them will happen, whether that should be something constant, which we call natural, or some unusual thing that happens infrequently, which we call miraculous. They therefore said that on the sixth day He put it into the nature of the earth that Korach and his followers should be swallowed up by it, into the nature of the well that it should give forth water, into the nature of the donkey that she should speak, and so on. One might object that if all miracles were implanted into the nature of things during the six days of creation, why does the mishna single out these ten things? You should know, in answer to this, that they did not single them out because no miracles other than these were implanted into the nature of things. They meant simply that these were the only things that were put in during dusk, whereas the other miracles were put into the nature of things from the very beginning, at the moment they were made. They would say, for example, that when the waters were divided on the second day, it was made part of their nature that the Red Sea should part for Moses, and the Jordan for Joshua and Elisha. And when the sun was created on the fourth day, it was made part of its nature that it should stop in its orbit at a given time when spoken to by Joshua. This is so for all other miracles aside from these ten, which were put into the nature of those things during dusk.</i><br>He clarifies this further in his book the Guide for the Perplexed, 2:29. There, after quoting the midrash that says G-d stipulated with the sea that it should split for Israel and with all of what was created during the six days similarly (Bereshit Rabbah 5:5), he concludes: <i>when G-d has a prophet perform a sign he tells him the moment at which what he is saying will come to pass, and it happens in accordance with the nature that was implanted into the thing.</i><br>But there is great difficulty with this position, for Moses said to Pharaoh, “for what time should I entreat for you… to excise the frogs” (Exodus 8:5), and Isaiah said, “request a sign from Hashem, your G-d, request it in the depths or high above” (Isaiah 7:11). And Gideon’s request of the sign with the wool involved two opposing possibilities (Judges 6:36). <b>Midrash Shmuel</b> writes in the name of <b>Meiri</b> that the Sages do not believe that these stipulations the midrash refers to were made in the permanent nature of the thing that was acted upon; they were undoubtedly speaking from the perspective of the Actor and His will. They mean to say that there was no change in His will, G-d forbid, for at the moment that He created the heavens and the earth and all that is within them His knowledge encompassed and included all of the things that would happen in the future; He knew that there would come a point at which He would change the nature of a particular created thing, and He created it with that in mind. The act of the miracle, therefore, was not a change in His knowledge or a new element in His will, etc.<br>This means that all the signs were created and done at that particular moment in time, and were not implanted into nature such that they should come into existence and be done at that moment. And although His knowledge already encompassed them we have already noted above on the mishna of “all is seen”, 3:15, that His knowledge does not turn the possible into the necessary. As such, all miracles depend on what a person chooses from among the things that are possible, as they are all done for people.<br>And I say that, just as <b>Rambam</b> resolves the paradox of “all is seen, but permission is given” using the verse “for My thoughts are not your thoughts” (Isaiah 55:8), as I wrote on the mishna at 3:15, I will likewise answer that the end of that verse itself is the resolution of the great paradox inherent in the subject of miracles. For there is no change in His will, which is the meaning of the end of the verse, “and your ways are not My ways” (ibid.). His “ways” are His actions, as Moses said, “make Your ways known to me” (Exodus 33:13), which are His actions and administration of the world. When Isaiah says “your ways are not My ways” he means that you should not understand My ways in terms of your ways, and then this great paradox will not arise. <b>Rambam</b> himself writes in the Guide for the Perplexed at the end of 3:20: <i>the terms supervision, knowledge, and intent when said of G-d are not the same as when said of us. When these different kinds of supervision, knowledge, and intent are conflated and treated as though they are the same, the abovementioned paradoxes arise. But when it becomes clear that whatever is said of us differs from what is said of Him, the truth becomes clear. And the prophet told us of the difference between the things said of Him and of us when he said “and your ways are not My ways.”</i><br>It also seems from his language in the above-quoted segment from Guide for the Perplexed 2:29<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">210</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There, <b>Rambam</b> calls the words of the midrash “strange,” though a better translation might be “extroardinary.”</i> that although he explains the opinion of the Sages that way, it is not his own. It suffices for us that we have rescued <b>Rambam</b>, at least as far as his own opinion, even if we cannot rescue him regarding the opinion he attributes to the Sages.<br>But I say that the opinion of <b>Meiri</b> is that of the Sages as well and is not foreign to them, G-d forbid—it emerges clearly from explicit verses in the Tanach which every elementary schooler knows. When they say these things were created at the dusk of the Sabbath they are speaking only of His knowledge, like the mishna of “all is seen”, as <b>Meiri</b> says. As for their saying that G-d stipulated with the sea during the six days of creation that it should split, I feel that this is not at all about refuting the notion of a change in His will. Rather, this dictum is of the same tenor as the one on the verse “on the sixth day” that I quoted earlier in my commentary to 2:8, which says that G-d stipulated with all of creation that it only continue if the Jewish people accept the five books of the Torah. This has nothing to do with the nature of the created things, and speaks rather about the purpose of the creation of the world, which was only created for the Jewish people to receive the Torah; should they not accept it, the world will return to “formlessness and void”, for it was only created for this purpose. All of the conditions mentioned in the midrash were said in the same vein, using language that emphasized the merit and great importance of Israel. G-d stipulated with the sea during creation that it part for Israel, as it is for that purpose that He created the sea; and with the sun that is stand still for Joshua, as it is for that purpose that it was created.<br>They thus conveyed to us one of the fundamentals of faith: that everything was created solely for Israel, which accords with the midrash that says “ ‘In the beginning’—for the sake of Israel, who are called ‘the beginning’ “ (Vayikra Rabbah 36:4) and numerous other dicta that speak the praises and merits of Israel. Now we do not deny that, in saying this, they also meant that He knows the conclusions of things at their beginnings and sees the end of something from the very first moment, but only insofar as this is the nature of His knowledge, as in “all is seen”. But it was not their primary intent to rid us of the mistaken notion that His will and knowledge are subject to change, for they never entertained these ideas to begin with, as Isaiah the prophet already removed the confusion surrounding this by saying “My thoughts are not your thoughts, and your ways are not My ways,” meaning that they are not to be compared at all, which will prevent us from falling into the paradox. And in using the language “G-d stipulated” they meant the same thing as the midrash on “the sixth day”.<br>Our master <b>Maharal</b> offers “wondrous counsel and great wisdom” (cf. Isaiah 28:29) in <i>Derech Chaim</i> to negate this question altogether. He says that “knowledge” and “ability” and such are all actions of G-d, just as “and G-d knew” (Exodus 2:25) was an action of G-d. Just as the other actions attributed to Him do not necessitate a change or plurality within Him, neither do these, and in these matters we rely on the Kabbalah. See there.",
                    "WERE CREATED AT THE DUSK OF THE SABBATH, AND THEY ARE: THE MOUTH OF THE EARTH, ETC. Even according to <b>Rambam</b> above, these things were singled out as having happened specifically at this time. Many ideas have been put forth to explain why this is; you can find them in <b>Midrash Shmuel</b>. I haven’t seen fit to reproduce a single one of them, as I don’t see that any of them have succeded.<br>I see that on the previous mishna of the ten miracles that were done for our ancestors in the Temple <b>Maharal</b> writes in <i>Derech Chaim</i> that the mishna starts with a woman, “no woman miscarried”, and ends with “no man ever said that there was not enough room” because these things correspond to the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>blimah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">211</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ten <i>sefirot</i>, lit. “countings”, often popularly translated as “emanations”, are one of the central elements of the Kabbalah. They are called “the <i>sefirot</i> of <i>blimah</i>” in <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>, one of the earliest Kabbalistic works.</i>; he explains them one by one, see there. I felt it would be just as appropriate and even more so to expound that way here. For the world, certainly including these ten things, was created through the ten <i>sefirot</i> of <i>blimah</i>. And the mishna starts from the mouth of the earth the same way that the previous one starts with the miracles that happened to women. But I will not speak of what is beyond me.<br>I will rather speak in terms of the exoteric, and say that these ten things correspond to the ten utterances through which the world was created. In the first utterance, the verses spoke of the earth, which was formlessness and void. The mouth of the well corresponds to the utterance “let there be light”, for that light was hidden away (Chagigah 12a) and the well was also hidden away in the sea of Tiberias (Shabbat 35a). The mouth of the donkey corresponds to the utterance “let there be a firmament… and let it separate”, in which the waters supernaturally became the Upper Waters; in the case of the mouth of the donkey, a higher force was also supernaturally placed in a coarse material being. The rainbow corresponds to the utterance “let the waters be gathered... and let the dry land be seen”, for the rainbow comes about from the humidity of moist earth that the rains have made wet. The manna corresponds to the utterance “let the earth bring forth vegetation… fruit trees…”, for these are man’s bread and his fruit that grows in its season, and corresponding to them G-d rained down the heavenly produce of manna. The staff corresponds to the utterance “let there be lights” of which it is said that “they will be signs”, and G-d sent Moses His servant with the staff that he was to use for giving signs. The verse “do not fear the signs of the heavens” (Jeremiah 10:2) is related to this. The <i>shamir</i> is a worm-like creature that comes from the utterance “let the waters swarm, etc.” The script and the inscription correspond to the two utterances “let the earth bring forth living things of every kind” and “let Us make man”, for both have to do with life and spirit, as do the script and the inscription. The inscription has more of a spiritual dimension, for it could be read from all four directions, as <b>Rav</b> writes. Similarly, man became a superior living creature that speaks and rules over the four corners of the earth. The tablets correspond to the utterance “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” with the seed of man, which are created in the image of G-d. The tablets are likewise the “work of G-d” (Exodus 32:16).<br>Behold, this is what I consider the straight path. “Give to a wise man, and he will grow wiser” (Proverbs 9:9) and think of more satisfying explanations. This approach also explains why our tanna did not keep to any chronological order in his list.",
                    "[*THE MOUTH OF THE EARTH. <b>Rav</b> explains that this was to swallow Korach and his followers; so also <b>Rambam</b>. This is difficult, for the verse there says “if G-d will create a creation” (Numbers 16:30), and according to the tradition of the Sages here, which is from scholar to scholar all the way back to Moses, it had already been created.<br>The Talmud in Sanhedrin 110a explains the verse as follows: <i>Rava expounded: what is the meaning of the verse “if G-d will create a creation [Heb. </i>im beriah yivra<i>], and the earth open up its mouth”? Moses said to G-d, “if [Heb. </i>im<i>]” Gehinnom “has been created [Heb.</i> beriah<i>]”, very well. If not, “let G-d create [it] [Heb. </i>yivra<i>]”. In what sense? If this actually means “create”, why, “there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). Rather, the request was to bring the opening of Gehinnom closer</i>. But according to this, the word <i>im</i> is used for a rhetorical question,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">212</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Talmud’s final reading, the verse says, “Is Gehinnom close? [No.] Then G-d will bring the opening here.” </i> which is also a forced reading. I therefore propose an alternative, for which purpose I will first raise three points.<br>The first is that Moses’ request uses the word <i>ufatz'tah</i>,“the earth shall open [Heb. <i>ufatz'tah</i>] its mouth” (Numbers 16:30), but in describing the execution of that request the verse says <i>vatiftach</i>, “and [the earth] opened” (Numbers 16:32). And even if the verses had not used this word in describing the execution, one wonders why Moses wouldn’t use the verb <i>patach</i>, which is a more common word than the verb <i>patzah</i>. The second is that the verse says “they descended alive to Sheol [Heb. <i>sheolah</i>]” (Numbers 16:33), using <i>sheolah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">213</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word is in the accusative case with locative sense. In other words, the suffix <i>-ah</i> means “to”: “to Sheol”. The Torah does not always attach the <i>-ah</i> suffix even when speaking of motion towards.</i> instead of <i>sheol</i>. <b>Rashi</b>, writing on the verse “the wicked shall return to She’ol [Heb. <i>lisheolah</i>]” in Psalms 9:18, says: <i>R. Abba bar Zavdi says: to the lowest level of Sheol.</i> Although we cannot deny the testimony of the verses, when the verse relates that it became known that they descended to the lowest level of <i>sheol</i>, wouldn’t it have been proper to relate how exactly that became known? We must therefore investigate where the verse tells us this. The third is that the verse says that the entire nation “fled at the sound [of their voices] [Heb. <i>lekolam</i>]” (Numbers 16:34). People who hear others cry out “<i>oy</i> and <i>avoy!</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The equivalent of English “Oh, no!”</i> do not usualy flee, they come nearer to the sound of the voices to determine the reason for their screaming. <b>Rashi</b> writes that <i>lekolam </i>means “at the sound that came from their being swallowed,” and <b>Mizrachi</b> explains that this is the sound of the splitting itself, which was like the sound of thunder, which throws people into a panic and causes them to flee. But this was not the sound of their cries at the moment they were swallowed up, for that sound is not the kind of sound that causes people to flee. On the contrary, it would cause people to gather round and come to hear their cries at that moment and see the great wonder, the like of which had not occurred from the six days of creation until then—these are his words.<br>I now say that although <b>Mizrachi</b> says that the sound of the splitting was like thunder, I can claim that the sound was the sound of words, words which made known that they had descended alive to Sheol, i.e. to the lowest level of Sheol. The earth emitting the sound of clear words saying that they had descended alive to the lowest level of Sheol, i.e. that they had suffered that much, would have been a great sign. And this is what Moses requested when he said “let it open” using <i>ufatz'tah</i>. For had he simply requested that it open in order to swallow them he should have said <i>ufat'chah</i>, which is the word used in the description of the event itself. He used <i>ufatz'tah</i>, which is the word Jephthah uses when he says <i>patziti pi lashem</i>, “I have opened my mouth to G-d”, in Judges 11:35, and the word used in <i>patzu sefatai</i>, “my lips opened” in Psalms 66:14, both of which refer to speech.<br>This, then, is how to parse Moses’ request. <i>Im beriah yivra Hashem ufatz'tah ha'adamah—</i>the word <i>beriah</i> appears without an implied prepositional <i>bet</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We should read the word <i>beriah</i>, “creation”, as if it were <i>baberiah</i>, “through the creation”.</i> as in the verse <i>ki sheshet yamim asah Hashem</i>, “in six days G-d made” (Exodus 20:10), where the word <i>sheshet</i> is understood as if it were <i>b'sheshet</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reading the verse as is gives “for six days G-d made”; the verse should be read as if the word <i>sheshet</i>, “six”, were <i>besheshet</i>, “in six”, giving “for in six days G-d made”.</i>, and the verse <i>un'shalmah parim sefateinu</i>, “and we shall make up for bulls with our lips” (Hosea 14:3), where the word <i>sefateinu</i> is understood as if it were <i>bisfateinu</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Reading the verse as is gives “we shall make up for bulls our lips”; the verse should be read as if the word <i>sefateinu</i>, “our lips”, were <i>bisfateinu</i>, “with our lips”, giving “we shall make up for bulls with our lips”.</i>. We can now read the verse: <i>im baberiah</i>, “if in the created thing”, i.e. Gehinnom, which was created during the six days of creation, <i>yivra</i>, “he shall create”, i.e. bring its opening here as the Sages say, and through bringing the opening here <i>ufatz'tah ha'adamah et piha</i>, “the earth shall open its mouth” to bring forth the sound of a voice speaking words made by lips relating what happens within all the way down to the lowest level of Sheol, [“then shall you know that these people have provoked G-d”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tosafot Yom Tov does not supply the end of the verse.</i>].<br>Afterwards, during the execution, the verse says <i>vatiftach ha’aretz et piha</i>, “the earth opened its mouth”, i.e. merely an opening of the mouth but no speech, for the opening was only in order to swallow them. In addition, however, it happened that everybody “fled at their sound”, which is the sound that emerged upon their being swallowed, a voice speaking words relating that they had descended alive to the lowest level of Sheol.<br>I have somewhat of a proof to my approach, for the tanna in speaking of the donkey says “the mouth of the donkey” and not that the donkey itself was created at dusk. Now all mouths, in and of themselves, are equivalent; there is no need for that mouth to have been created at dusk unless “mouth” in the context of the donkey means “speech”, which indeed was created at dusk. If so, “the mouth of the earth” also refers to speech, [not]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew text is missing the obvious negative.</i> simply an opening of the mouth. Also, the “mouth of the well”, according to the other opinion that <b>Rav</b> mentions in his commentary, means that the well sang. This is what seems best to me, and in my eyes it is truly well said.]",
                    "THE MOUTH OF THE WELL. <b>Rav</b>: <i>the well of Miriam which traveled with the Jews in the desert</i>. <b>Maharal</b> writes in <i>Derech Chaim</i> that wherever they went the well would come up and bring forth water, and it had a mouth through which the water would come out wherever they went. But the rock most likely did not go from place to place with them, as would seem from <b>Rashi</b>’s words in his commentary to Pesachim 54a, for if so, why would the mishna not mention the miracle that the rock gave forth water although it was not connected to the ground? And he writes that <b>Rashi</b>’s words must then be understood as agreeing with his explanation.<br><b>Rav</b>: <i>and some say that it opened its mouth and sang, as the verse says </i>ali be'er enu lah<i> (Numbers 21:17)—</i>i.e., they answered the words of the well.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse is usually understood to mean “they said it about the well”. Tosafot Yom Tov explains that according to <b>Rav</b>, the verse must be read “about the well, they answered it”—i.e., the song of the well was a call and response between the well and the people.</i> [*See above. This approach explains why the mishna does not say “the mouth of the rock”, for according to the first approach it was the rock which brought forth the water. And it is of any given rock’s mouth, which brought fourth the water, that the mishna should say that it was created at dusk. Now that the mishna says “the mouth of the well” we must offer the forced reading that this refers to the mouth through which the well could come out. According to the second approach, however, the tanna actually means “the mouth of the well”, which sang.]",
                    "AND THE MOUTH OF THE DONKEY. <b>Rav</b>: <i>it was decreed at dusk that she speak to Balaam.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the donkey itself was not created then, but the created world included the decree that the donkey Balaam rode would speak to him.</i> For it is impossible that she would have lived that long, from the six days of creation until the time of Balaam. <b>Maharal</b> writes as much in <i>Derech Chaim</i>, where he says that all these ten things were not actually created at dusk; it was the decree that G-d decreed which was created at dusk. For it is unlikely that the ram of Isaac lived from the six days of creation until the days of Abraham. And <b>Rav</b> says the same of the ram: <i>it was decreed at dusk that it be caught in the brush by its horns at the moment of the Akeidah</i>.

                    "THE INSCRIPTION. <b>Rav</b>: <i>the inscription could be read from all four directions</i>. What seems most likely to me is that this was some kind of miraculous thing, “the work of G-d” (Exodus 32:16). Many of the commentators on the relevant passage in the Jerusalem Talmud strugled with this. See <b>Ein Yaakov</b> and <b>Yefeh Mar'eh</b>. I prefer the words of the most recent of the comentators, <b>R. Menachem Azariah of Fano</b> in his work <i>Asarah Ma'amarot</i>, in the treatise <i>Chakor Din</i>, 2:20, commenting on the passage in the Jerusalem Talmud. There he says that they were the “work of G-d” that our minds cannot imagine, “not like the work of some commoner that others have drawn for us in the study hall, which a boy could come up with”.",

                    "SOME SAY, EVEN THE <i>MAZIKIN</i>… SOME SAY, EVEN THE TONGS… <b>Maharal</b> concludes in <i>Derech Chaim</i> that these other opinions do not argue on the previous ones, each adding, rather, to the ones that preceded. For dusk has several parts, as the Talmud says in Shabbat 34b: <i>what is dusk? Starting at sunset, as long as the eastern sky is red—the words of R. Yehudah. R. Nechemiah says: the time, starting at sunset, that it takes a man to walk half a </i>mil<i>. R. Yossi says that dusk is like the blink of an eye—day ends and night begins, and it is imperceptible.</i> He writes that the number of times our mishna says “some say” varies by version. He establishes the correct version as: “[some say] the ram of Isaac and the grave of Moses”—for these are both necessary for two great righteous men—“and some say, even the <i>mazikin</i>, and some say, even the tongs.” These three “some say”s divide dusk—whatever dusk is being discussed, other than the dusk of R. Yossi, which does not last any amount of time at all—into three periods, for every measurable thing has a beginning, middle, and end. These are his words.<br>According to the Talmud, which says that our mishna should not include the tongs, there are only two additions. One corresponds to the dusk of R. Nechemiah, and the other to the dusk of R. Yehudah. And the same could be said for our version, which only has two “some say”s.<br>According to all opinions the first ten things were created simultaneously at the dusk of R.

But this does not seem reasonable, for the tractate would not end with talk of dying and ceasing from the world; we find that the tannaim are very particular about this, as they said (Kelim 30:4), “praiseworthy are you, Kelim, for you started with purity and ended with purity”, and did likewise at the end of tractate Yadayim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">236</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which quotes Pharaoh refusing to send the Israelites out of Egypt, and then mentions Pharaoh saying that G-d is righteous to end on a good note.</i> all because of “do not stop at a bad thing” (Ecclesiastes 8:3).",

                    "AT THIRTEEN, THE COMMANDMENTS. <b>Rav</b>: <i>for the verse says, “should a man or woman commit one of the sins of man” (Numbers 5:6), and in the story of Shechem the verse says “and the two sons of Jacob, Simon and Levi, the brothers of Dina, each [Heb. </i>ish<i>] took their swords” (Genesis 34:25), and Levi was thirteen at the time, and is called </i>ish<i>, a man</i>. <b>Rashi</b>: <i>consider that Jacob spent another thirteen yars with Laban after marrying Leah. If one allows seven months for each of her pregnancies, then since Levi was the third pregnancy, he was born about two years in. He would then have been eleven years old when they left. Add to that the six months they spent on the road and the eighteen months—a summer, a winter, and another summer—that they spent in Sukkot, which makes two years altogether, and it turns out that Levi was thirteen years old when they arrived at Shechem, and was called </i>ish<i>, a man</i>. In his commentary on the Torah, in parashat Vayeshev, on the verse “and he mourned his son many days” (Genesis 37:34), <b>Rashi</b> is not being precise when he writes that six months of that two-year period were spent in Beit El, as that happened after the incident in Shechem.

I counted them and even included the two written in the verse “and G-d, the Lord, built the side” and could only find sixteen. <b>Rashi</b> writes that <i>adam</i> appears eighteen times from the beginning of Bereshit until the verse “for this one was taken from man [Heb. <i>ish</i>]” (Genesis 2:23). We must say that he included the word <i>ish</i> in the count.",
                    "AT TWENTY, CHASING. The <b>Rav</b>’s second explanation is that the heavenly court only begins to punish a person at 20. This is taken from Bemidbar Rabbah 18:4. It seems this was based on the fact that only those who were twenty years old at the incident of the spies died in the desert (Numbers 14:29).",
                    "AT FORTY, UNDERSTANDING. <b>Rav</b>: <i>for after the Israelites had been in the desert for forty years, Moses said to them, “for G-d has not given you a heart to know, eyes to see, and ears to hear until this very day” (Deuteronomy 29:3).</i> This is from the Talmud, Avodah Zarah 5b. But it is difficult to see how this is a proof, because the people who were in the desert for forty years after the giving of the Torah were much more than forty years old. Perhaps the proof is from the fact that Moses was addressing all of them, even the ones that were children at the giving of the Torah. So the verse reads “for G-d has not given all of you.” For some of them, who were older at the giving of the Torah, had already been granted this by G-d when they reached the age of forty.<br>One can also answer that at the giving of the Torah the Israelites all converted to Judaism, for the Talmud extracts the law that a convert must immerse from the story of the giving of the Torah, as I wrote on the mishna in Pesachim 8:8, and “a convert is like a newborn child” (Yevamot 22a).",
                    "AT SIXTY, OLD AGE. <b>Rav</b>: <i>for the verse says, “you will go to the grave in old age [Heb. </i>bechelach<i>]” (Job 5:26), and the alphanumeric value of </i>bechelach<i> is sixty.</i> Although the <i>bet</i> of <i>bechelach</i> is a preposition, it is counted for the alphanumeric value of the word, as is clear from the Talmud in Moed Kattan 28a where this verse is expounded. Although that passage quotes our verse in connection with the punishment of death by the heavenly court and here <b>Rav</b> understands it to refer to old age, this is because he is using the simple meaning of the verse, which is discussing good things as is clear from the end of it: “as a sheaf is brought in, in its season.” And just before that, “and you will know that there is peace in your tent” (Job 5:24).<br><b>Midrash Shmuel</b> writes that some versions have “at sixty, wisdom”. <b>Ritva</b> agrees, and adduces the verse “wisdom is among the old [Heb. <i>bi(ye)shishim</i>]” (Job 12:12). <i>Bi(ye)shishim</i> is read as an abbreviation for <i>ben shishim</i>, sixty years old.<br>It is possible that even according to our version, the “old age” in the mishna refers to wisdom, for the Talmud (Kiddushin 32b) says that an old person [Heb. <i>zaken</i>] means a wise one, for <i>zaken</i> is an abbreviation for <i>ze shekanah chochma</i>, one who acquired wisdom. See below.",
                    "AT NINETY, BENDING [Heb. <i>lashuach</i>]. <b>Rav</b>: <i>some say this word comes from “a deep pit [Heb. </i>shuchah<i>]” (Proverbs 22:14)</i>. <b>Midrash Shmuel</b> objects in the name of <b>Chasid Ya’avetz</b> that if so, the mishna should have said <i>leshuchah</i>, to the pit. Also, we never find the grave being called <i>shuchah</i>. Also, if one is already buried at ninety, how does he die at a hundred?<br>The last objection is not a strong one, for the mishna simply means that at that age one is fit to be in the grave. One must say the same of <b>Rav</b>’s commentary to “at sixty, old age”, where the verse in Job must mean not that he will die at sixty, but that he will die in old age, and that if he dies at sixty that is considered having reached old age."
