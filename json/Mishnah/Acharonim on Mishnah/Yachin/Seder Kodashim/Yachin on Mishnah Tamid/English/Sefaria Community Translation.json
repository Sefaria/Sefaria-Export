                "The fact that [the Mishnah] says 'a psalm, a song for the time to come,' does not mean that the Levites said that phrase [when singing the psalm in the Temple].  Rather, the Tanna (the Teacher of this Mishnah) explains the reason why they recited this Psalm.  In the case of the preceding (weekday psalms), the character of each day is clear in the [corresponding] psalm, which is why they recited it on that day.  However, nothing in the 'psalm, song for the Sabbath day' refers to Shabbat itself, so that it appears surprising that this psalm was designated for the Sabbath day.  Therefore the Teacher explains that this [psalm] is distinct from the psalms of the other days of the week, all of which refer to the past, while this psalm refers to the time to come.  Since this is a day of rest from the troublesome matters of everyday life, therefore, after [completing] the round of the days of creation, it is fitting for one to consider and to express in song the kindnesses of the Name for three aspects of the future toward which everyone aims:",
                "1. A psalm, a song for the time to come:  That is, what is to come to a person in this world, for \"His mercies, may He be blessed, never end.\"",
                "2. A psalm, a song for a day which will be all Shabbat.  This is the life of the World to Come, after the soul departs the body.  Even then one will take shelter under the wings of His mercy, may He be blessed.",
                "3. A psalm, a song for the third future that is appointed to one, at the time that will be 'rest for the life of the worlds.'  After the world is destroyed at the end of the sixth millennium, all the life of the worlds will rest for a millennium, until the Holy One will rebuild the world anew.",
                "All three of these hoped-for, positive outcomes are included in this psalm, as one can see when one looks well at all of its words."
