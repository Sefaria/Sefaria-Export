                "That is to say, Moshe was very humble, such that he received the Torah, which is compared to water that leaves a high place and collects in a low one [Taanit]. And so he received Torah from Sinai, the lowest of the mountains [Megillah 29a]. This teaches that only through humility, the source of all attributes of integrity, can one attain Torah."

Because whether he is angry, arrogant, jealous, or similar, its not enough to not befriend him, in order not to learn from his actions since it will hurt your Soul, rather, distance yourself from him so it doesn't hurt your body."

                "<b>Each and every day a [heavenly] echo (lit., daughter of a sound) goes out from Mount Horeb</b> The [scholars] in the books of [geography] have said that the sound of an echo – like the sound of thunderous words that no one can understand – is constantly heard around Mount Sinai in the air above the mountain even today  . And this is a wondrous thing. And in my humble opinion, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is hinting to these. Since the sounds that are heard there hint to man to remind him of the giving of the Torah; and that it thunders now about the generation that does not honor it properly to observe its commandments properly. And this is the small sound that reverberates from the great sound that was heard then on the day of the gathering at the time of the giving of the Torah. And this is the \"daughter of a sound\" that is mentioned here; meaning to say a sound born of another sound."
