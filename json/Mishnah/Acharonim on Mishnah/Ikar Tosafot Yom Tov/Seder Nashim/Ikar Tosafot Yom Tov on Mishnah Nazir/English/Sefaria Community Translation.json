                "In the Gemara: And if you will ask: Let it say, \"Beit Hillel holds that one can ask [to repeal a vow] of sanctification;\" one can answer, it is because - according to Beit Hillel - while it is still true that he is not a Nazerite from wine [as a result of his vow], nonetheless, let him be in a vow [against] eating cakes of figs. That is why it states that he is completely exempt - that he is not volunteering in the way of those that make an oath of their own volition. Since, if he came to make a vow [about] fig cakes, he should have used the term, <i>konam</i> (an introductory expression indicating a vow not to do or use something) which is the [standard] way of those that make vows. (Tosafot)",
                "And if you will ask: And behold, he said, \"Nazerite;\" and [so] how could he be in [standard, non-Nazerite] vow; one can answer that, 'Nazerite' is a term of separation, as if he said: \"behold I am separating from cakes of figs.\" And even though Rabbi Yehuda holds that he said, \"a sacrifice\" without [the letter,] <i>kaf</i>, (which means 'like'), he would not be taking a vow on a sacrifice, [since] when he says, \"upon me,\" he doesn't need the <i>kaf</i> (to indicate that it is only like a sacrifice and not a sacrifice itself)."
