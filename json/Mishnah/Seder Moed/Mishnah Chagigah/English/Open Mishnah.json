            "All are obligated in seeing [the Temple Mount], except for a deaf mute, an incompetent, or a minor; an intersexual, an androgyne; women, unfreed slaves; a lame person, a blind person, or a sick person; or an old person who cannot stand upon his feet.  Who is a minor? Anyone who cannot ride on his father's shoulders and go up from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, according to the House of Shammai; The House of Hillel say: Anyone who cannot hold his father's hand and go up from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, for it says, \"Three regalim\" (Exodus 23:14)",
            "The House of Shammai say: The appearance-offering is two silver [ma'ah], and the festival-offering is a silver ma'ah. The House of Hillel say: The appearance-offering is a silver ma'ah, and the festival-offering is two silver [ma'ah].",
            "Burnt-offerings on [the intermediate days of] a holiday come [only] from unconsecrated funds, and peace-offerings come [even] from the [second] tithe.  On the first sacred day of Passover, The House of Shammai say: [‍they come‍] [only] from unconsecrated funds; and the House of Hillel say: [they come] [even] from the [second] tithe.",
            "Israelites fulfill their obligation with pledged and consecrated animals and with ma'aser behema (tithe animals), and the priests (kohanim) - with the chatat and with the asham sacrifices and with the bechor (firstborn animal) and with the breast and with the shoulder, but not with fowl and not with flour offerings (minchah)",

            "Dissolving vows flies in the air, there is no basis for it.  Laws concerning shabbat and festival-offering and stealing from holy-designated things, these are like mountains hung from a hair:  they have few verses and many laws.  Judgment and service and purity and impurity and improper sexual relations, they have plenty to be based on.  They themselves are the body of Torah."
