            "As long as it is lawful for the priests to eat of the heave-offering, [the Israelite] may give [non-consecrated articles of leaven] to his domestic or wild animals, or to fowls; he may also sell it to strangers, or derive benefit from it in any other way; but when that time is passed, it is unlawful to derive any benefit whatever from it, not even to use it as fuel, or to light therewith an oven or stove. R. Jehudah says, \"The removal of leaven must be effected by its being burned:\" but the sages say, \"It must be crumbled into small particles, cast forth to the wind, or thrown into the sea.\"",
            "Leaven belonging to a stranger, which has been in existence during the Passover, may be used after that festival, but not when it belonged to an Israelite, because it is said (Exodus 13:7), \"Neither shall there be any leaven seen in all thy quarters.\"",
            "When a stranger has lent money to an Israelite upon the security of leavened articles, they may be applied to use after the Passover; but when an Israelite has lent money to a stranger upon leavened articles, they may not be applied to use after the Passover; leaven that has been covered by fallen ruins, must be considered as banished and removed; Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel says, \"Only then, when it is so much covered that a dog cannot drag it out.\"",
            "If any person should eat leavened heave-offering during the Passover through error, he shall pay the principal, and the fifth part in addition; but if he did it wilfully, he is free of the obligation of repayment, and of paying for the value of the wood in case of the heave-offering being unclean.",
            "A person discharges his obligation with the following articles on Passover:—with cakes made of wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye; also with ‏דמאי‎ [corn which it is doubtful whether it was tithed], with the first tithe, of which the heave-offering has been taken, and with the second tithe, and consecrated things which have been redeemed. Priests,—with the cake of the dough [‏חלה‎], and the heave-offering, but not with that which is yet mixed or untithed [‏טבל‎], nor with the first tithe of which the heave-offering has not been taken, nor with unredeemed second tithe, and consecrated things not ransomed; also, not with the cakes of thank-offering, and the thin cakes of the Nazarite's offering, if they had prepared them for their own use; but if for public sale, they may discharge their obligation therewith.",
            "The obligation of eating bitter herbs on the Passover, may be discharged with the following herbs: namely, with lettuce, wild endive, and garden endive, with ‏חרחבינה‎, and bitter coriander, either fresh or in a dried state, but not if pickled, boiled, or cooked in any way: they may also be combined to the size of an olive, and the obligation is discharged if the stalks of them only had been used; and also when it is doubtful whether they were tithed, or are of the first tithe of which the heave-offering was taken, or of the second tithe, or of redeemed consecrated things.",
            "It is prohibited to soak bran on the Passover to feed fowls; but it is permitted to pour boiling water thereon; a woman may not soak the bran which she takes with her to the bath, but must use it in a dry state to rub her body therewith. A person may not masticate grains of wheat to put it [as a poultice] on his wound, because they will become leavened.",
            "It is unlawful to put flour in ‏חרוסת‎, or in mustard, but if it were done, it must be immediately eaten; but R. Meir prohibits it. The paschal sacrifice may not be boiled in any liquid, or juice of fruit; but it is permitted to moisten it [after it has been roasted], or to dip it [in any liquid when eaten]. Water which a baker uses [to cool his hands while kneading ‏מעות‎ unleavened-cakes] must be thrown away immediately, because it becomes leaven."

            "[With] these items [we] would be transgressing on Pesach [since they are considered <i>chamets</i>]: Babylonian ‏<i>kutach</i> [a type of bread pudding], Median beer, Edomite vinegar, Egyptian ale, bran water [used by] dyers, working dough [used by] cooks, and glue [used by] scribes; Rabbi Eliezer says, \"Also the adornments [used by] women.\" This is the general rule: whatever is [made] from a type of grain [and is leavened], behold [with] this, [one] transgresses on Pesach; behold these  [incur the penalty attached to the transgression of] an admonitory precept, but they do not [bring about] <i>karet</i> [Divinely imposed punishment consisting in severance from Heaven and/or the Jewish people‎].",

And so too with respect to impurity. [However] if one is particular about it [and doesn't want it there], it forms a separation, but if he wants its preservation [in the trough], it is [considered] as [a part of] the trough. If there is a 'silent' dough [that has not visibly become  leavened]: if there is one similar to it that has become leavened, behold [that 'silent' dough] is forbidden. ",

Rabbi Eliezer says, \"One should not give it a name [to consider it as <i>challah</i>] until after it has been baked;\" Rabbi Yehuda ben Betera says, \"One should take it [to separate it] in cold [water];\" Rabbi Yehoshuah says, \"This is not the <i>chamets</i> that we are admonished about with [the prohibition of], '[it] shall not be seen and [it] shall not be found;' rather one separates it and leaves it until the evening, and if it becomes leavened, it becomes leavened [and he need not be concerned].",

This is the general rule: if [the dough] becomes inflated, she pounds [it] with cold [water].\"",
            "If [dough begins to become] leavened, it must be burned; but the one who eats it is exempt [from <i>karet</i>]. If [it] becomes cracked, it  must be burned, and the one who eats it is obligated [to undergo] <i>karet</i>. What [dough] is [considered as commencing to become] leavened? [When it shows small cracks standing apart] like the horns [antennae] of locusts. [What is considered] cracked? When the cracks cross each other - these are the words of Rabbi Yehuda. But the Sages say, \"Whoever eats either is obligated [to undergo] <i>karet</i>.\" What [dough] is [considered as commencing to become] leavened? When its surface has become [pale], like [the face of] a person whose hair stands on end [through fright].",
            "When the fourteenth [of Nissan] comes out on Shabbat, we must destroy all [<i>chamets</i>] before Shabbat - so says Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, \"[We destroy it at its [usual] time.\"; Rabbi Eliezer ben Tsadok says, \"<i>Terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] before Shabbat, and <i>chulin</i> [produce, animals,or food permitted for general consumption] at its [usual] time.\"",
            "If one is walking to go and slaughter his Pesach sacrifice, [or] to circumcise his son, [or] to attend a betrothal meal at the home of his father-in-law, and he remembers that he has <i>chamets</i> in his home; if he can return, destroy [it], and return to his mitzva, he should return and destroy [it]; and if not, he must annul it in his heart. [If one is walking to go and] save [people] from armed foes, or from the [flooding of a] river, or from robbers, or from fire, or from the collapse of ruined buildings, he must annul [the <i>chamets</i>] in his heart; and if [he is walking to go and] set up his optional Shabbat rest [so as to allow for himself a different area within which he may walk on Shabbat], he must return immediately [to destroy his <i>chamets</i>.",
            "And so too, one who went out of Jerusalem and remembered that he is carrying meat that is holy [consecrated]; if he has passed [Mt.] Scopus, he must burn it on the spot; and if not, he must return and burn it in front of the castle [the Temple], with wood from the arrangement [set up for the altar]. For up to how much must one return? Rabbi Meir says, \"For a <i>kebeitsah</i> [a specific unit of volume] in both cases [of <i>chamets</i> and of holy meat].\" Rabbi Yehuda says, For a <i>kazayit</i> in both cases.\" But the Sages say, \"[In the case of] holy meat, for a <i>kazayit</i> and [in the case of] <i>chamets</i>, for a <i>kebeitsah</i>.\""

One who goes from a place where they do [work], to a place where they do not do [work], or from a place where they do not do [work] to a place where they do [work], we place upon him the stringencies of the place he came from, [or] the stringencies of the place that he went to.

And these were [the ones] about which they did protest to them: they would allow the use of branches [growing on or near] <i>hekdesh</i> [property, living or inanimate, devoted by its owner for sacred purposes, by which action he ceases to be its owner]; and they would on Shabbat eat fruit which had dropped off [the trees]; and they would [leave over] <i>peah</i> [the requirement to leave, when harvesting, a corner of the field for the poor] to [also] be taken from vegetables - and they protested to them.",

About three they did not concede to him: He cut off [the gold from] the gates of the [Temple] sanctuary and sent [it] to the king of Assyria, and they did not concede to him; he stopped up the water-course of Gichon and they did not concede to him; and he made the month of Nissan intercalary during Nissan and they did not concede to him."

The <i>Kohanim</i> [members of the priestly caste, a subgroup of tribe of Levi, which is uniquely responsible for maintaining and carrying out the sacrificial services in the Temple] would stand in double rows and in their hands were beakers of silver and beakers of gold, [namely] one row which was completely silver, and one row which was completely gold; they would not mix [them]. And there were no [flat] bottoms to the beakers, lest they would put them down, and the blood coagulate.",
