            "\tAt \"light\" on the fourteenth (of Nissan) [i.e., the night followed by the fourteenth. The tanna calls it \"light,\" euphemistically, as a blind man is called \"sagi nehor\" (\"full of light\")], chametz is searched for [Some explain, so that he not be in transgression of the interdict against chametz being seen and being found in his house on Pesach. And even though nullification (bitul) itself is sufficient, we fear that he might find a choice morsel (of chametz), regret his nullification, think to eat it, and be in transgression of the interdict against chametz being seen and found. Therefore, chametz is searched for, to remove it from the world. Others say that the reason for searching is a decree, lest he find chametz in his house and eat it, not being accustomed to separation from chametz the other days of the year.] by the light of a candle. [The gemara derives this from its being written here (Exodus 12:19): \"Leaven shall not be found,\" and elsewhere (Genesis 44:12): \"and the cup was found.\" Just as the finding there was through searching, viz. (Ibid.): \"And he searched … and it was found,\" the finding here is through searching, and \"searching\" is (optimally) with a candle, viz. (Proverbs 20:27): \"The candle of G d is a man's soul; it searches all his hidden recesses.\" And they ordained that the searching take place at night because that is when everyone is found at home. And the light of a candle is better for searching with by night than by day, for \"Of what avail is a candle by day?\" However, if one did not search on the night preceding the fourteenth and he does so in the morning, he must also do so by the light of a candle.] Any place where chametz is not brought does not require searching. And why did they say [below] that two rows [of jugs] in a wine cellar [arranged one on top of the other require searching, if any place where chametz is not brought does not require searching? They answered: We are speaking of] a place where chametz is brought, [such as a wine cellar which supplies wine for one's table. Sometimes the steward is about to pour wine with his loaf in his hand, when he discovers that he is out of wine and he goes down to the cellar to bring more.] Beth Shammai say: Two rows on the face of the entire cellar. [It was the way of those who stored wine to arrange their jugs row after row until they covered the entire floor of the cellar, after which they would go back and place jug upon jug in the same pattern until the ceiling. The \"two rows\" of Beth Shammai are the outer row from the ground until the ceiling, and then the upper row, the length and width of the wine cellar, so that the \"two rows\" are like a Greek gamma, one perpendicular; the other, horizontal.] Beth Hillel say: The two outer upper rows, [the uppermost row near the ceiling, facing the entrance, and the row beneath that. And those within, he does not search at all. And of the outer ones, he searches the two top rows alone.]",
            "\tWe do not fear that a weasel might have carried (chametz) from house to house and from place to place. For if so — from courtyard to courtyard and from city to city — there is no end to the thing! [If he searched one corner of the house and came to the other corner, he need not fear: \"Perhaps when I came to this place, a weasel carried chametz to the already searched place, and I must go back and search.\" For if this were to be feared, it would have to be feared from courtyard to courtyard, too, viz.: \"I searched before for my neighbor. Perhaps after my search a weasel brought chametz from my neighbor's courtyard to mine — and there is no end to the thing!]",
            "\tR. Yehudah says: We search at \"light\" on the fourteenth, the morning of the fourteenth, and at the time of removal. [That is, we search in one of these three times alone; and after these three times, if one did not search, he may search no longer.] And the sages say: If he did not search at light on the fourteenth, he searches on the fourteenth. If he did not search on the fourteenth, he searches in the midst of the time, [i.e., the sixth hour, the time for removal.] If he did not search in the midst of the time, he searches after the time [until dark. Some explain: \"in the midst of the festival\" — in the midst of Pesach; \"after the festival\" — after Pesach, so that \"chametz over which Pesach has passed,\" from which it is forbidden to derive benefit, should not become intermixed with permitted chametz, which was produced after Pesach. And R. Yehudah holds that after removal, that is, after the time that chametz becomes forbidden, he should not search at all, lest he come to eat of it. And the Rabbis say that he should search after the time of removal and we are not afraid that he might come to eat of it, for his entire intent in searching for it is to burn it. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] And what he leaves over (for the morning from his search at night), he should secrete, so that he need not search after it.",
            "\tR. Meir says: We eat all five (hours on the fourteenth) and burn it in the beginning of the sixth. [Even though by Torah law the entire sixth hour is permitted, the rabbis decreed against (eating on) it, lest they err and come to confuse the seventh hour with the sixth; but they would not come to confuse the seventh with the fifth, for which reason it is permitted.] And R. Yehudah says: We eat all four, suspend all of the fifth, and burn it at the beginning of the sixth [and we do not eat on the fifth, a decree by reason of the possibility of a cloudy day on which they might err and confuse the seventh hour with the fifth. However, it is not necessary to burn it, and it can be fed to one's beast. But in the sixth hour, even derivation of benefit is forbidden, a decree by reason of the seventh. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah.",
            "\tR. Yehudah said further: Two chaloth [of chametz] of the todah (the thanksgiving offering) were pasul (unfit for eating) [having been rendered pasul by linah (passing the night without having been eaten)], and they were placed on the roof of the itzteva (the Temple portico). [For since there were many thanksgiving breads on the thirteenth of Nissan — for whoever had a todah to bring had to do so on the thirteenth — they (those which had not been eaten) became pasul by linah on the morning of the fourteenth. The thanksgiving breads consisted of forty chaloth, ten of them, chametz, and the todah could be eaten (only) on the (same) day and night. But if they were brought on the fourteenth, those of chametz could be eaten only until the sixth hour; and it is forbidden to bring an offering on a day when the time for eating it would be curtailed, for \"Consecrated offerings are not brought to the house of psul.\" Therefore, whoever was obliged to bring a todah would do so on the thirteenth, not being able to bring it on the fourteenth (all the more so, on Pesach), so that they (i.e., some of them) became pasul by linah on the morning of the fourteenth, there not having been enough eaters. Therefore, because they were pasul, they were placed there (for if they were kasher, they would not place them there and render them pasul deliberately.) They were placed there until the time of removal and they were burned, and they were placed on the roof of the itzteva to be visible as a sign.] So long as they were lying there, all the people ate (chametz). When one of them was removed [At the beginning of the fifth hour, the messenger of beth-din came and removed one, whereby all the people understood that the fifth hour had arrived and] they \"suspended\" (activity) — they neither ate nor burned (chametz). When both had been removed, all the people began to burn (their chametz). R. Gamliel says: Chullin (mundane food) is eaten all four (hours); terumah, all five, [it being forbidden to deliberately waste consecrated food so long as one is permitted to eat it], and it is burned at the beginning of the sixth, [for most people can confuse the seventh with the sixth. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Gamliel.]",
            "\tR. Chanina, the adjutant high-priest, says: From the days of the Cohanim, they never held back from burning the flesh which had become unclean through a v'lad (derivative) of tumah (uncleanliness) together with the flesh that had become unclean through av hatumah (proto-uncleanliness) even though they added uncleanliness to its uncleanliness. [This is stated here because of what is to follow (1:7): \"From their words we learned that clean terumah is burned together with unclean terumah.\" (\"from burning the flesh which had become unclean through a v'lad hatumah\":) We are speaking of a v'lad of a v'lad. That is, flesh which is of third-degree uncleanliness, which had become unclean through second-degree uncleanliness, so that it is a v'lad of a v'lad. They did not hold back from burning it together with flesh that had become unclean through av hatumah, and which had assumed first-degree uncleanliness. When this flesh, which in the beginning is of third-degree uncleanliness, comes in contact with the flesh that had become unclean through the av hatumah it reverts to its state of second-degree uncleanliness, having touched first-degree uncleanliness. It emerges, then, that they added uncleanliness to its uncleanliness. For in the beginning it was of third-degree uncleanliness, and now it is of second-degree uncleanliness — in spite of which they did not hold back from burning it together with a more stringent variety. For since even the lesser variety was slated for burning, they were not concerned about imparting to it a greater degree of uncleanliness. And even though by Torah law food does not impart uncleanliness to food, it being written in respect to food uncleanliness (Leviticus 11:38): \"It is unclean\" — It is unclean, but it does not render unclean a food like it — still, the rabbis decreed that food should impart uncleanliness to food.] R. Akiva added: From the days of the Cohanim, they never held back from kindling the oil [of terumah] that had become pasul (unfit) through a t'vul yom (one in a state of uncleanliness, who had immersed himself in the daytime and who is not clean until sunset) (they never held back from kindling that oil) in a lamp which had become unclean through one with dead-body uncleanliness, even though they added uncleanliness to its uncleanliness. [(\"from kindling the oil that had become pasul through a t'vul yom\":) That oil assumes third-degree uncleanliness, t'vul yom making terumah pasul by Torah law, and conferring on it always third-degree uncleanliness, whether it be food or liquid. (\"in a lamp which had become unclean by one with dead-body uncleanliness\":) This lamp is of metal. All vessels (except earthenware vessels) which touch dead-body uncleanliness become like it — if an av, an av; if first-degree, first-degree, it being written (Numbers 19:16): \"the slain one of a sword,\" which is expounded: The sword becomes like the slain one, i.e., The sword that touches the dead body becomes avi-avoth (\"the father of the fathers of uncleanliness\"), like the dead body itself. And if the sword touches one with dead-body uncleanliness, who is an av, the sword itself becomes an av. The same applies to all vessels, except earthenware vessels. It is seen, then, that if a metal lamp touches one with dead-body uncleanliness, it becomes an av-hatumah. R. Akiva, then, has added to the words of R. Chanina the adjutant high-priest. For R. Chanina permitted only the reversion of third-degree uncleanliness to second-degree uncleanliness, whereas R. Akiva permitted the reversion of third-degree to first-degree uncleanliness. For the oil which became pasul through a t'vul yom and which is of third-degree uncleanliness — when that oil is kindled in a lamp which has become unclean through one with dead-body uncleanliness, in which instance the lamp itself becomes av-hatumah, as stated — the oil of third-degree uncleanliness reverts to first-degree uncleanliness, in spite of which they did not hold back (from raising the uncleanliness level). For since it is already denominated as \"uncleanliness,\" they were not concerned (about the particular degree of uncleanliness), and it is permitted to add (to its level of uncleanliness) directly.]",
            "\tR. Meir said: From their words we learned that clean terumah (of chametz) is burned together with unclean terumah on Pesach. [Both R. Meir and R. Yossi hold that flesh which became unclean through v'lad hatumah, of which R. Chanina speaks, is flesh that became unclean through liquids which became unclean through a vessel which had become unclean through a sheretz. R. Meir holds that the uncleanliness of liquids to make others unclean is not Torah law — liquids making others, and even foods unclean, being a rabbinic enactment. Therefore, he says that from the words of R. Chanina, who says that we burn flesh that has become unclean through liquids, which is unclean by rabbinic ordinance, being absolutely clean by Torah law, we learned that clean terumah is burned together with unclean terumah on Pesach [when the sixth hour arrives, when it is forbidden by rabbinic ordinance, just as we burn flesh that became unclean through liquids (which is absolutely clean by Torah law) together with flesh that became unclean through an av hatumah, and which is unclean by Torah law.] R. Yossi said to him: This is not a correct comparison. [R. Yossi is consistent with his view that the uncleanliness of liquids to make others unclean is Torah law, so that flesh which became unclean through liquids is unclean by Torah law. Therefore, he says: \"This is not a correct comparison.\" That is, you cannot derive from their words that if it is permitted to burn lesser-degree uncleanliness together with greater-degree uncleanliness it should be permitted to burn what is clean (by Torah law) with what is unclean. And the halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi, that clean terumah is not burned together with unclean terumah on Pesach. And the uncleanliness of liquids to render others unclean is not Torah law, but rabbinic ordinance, as per R. Meir.] And R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua concur that each is to be burned by itself. [R. Yossi says this — that even though R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua differ as to the burning of terumah, they concur that each is burned by itself.] Where do they differ? In respect to the doubtful (possibly clean-possibly unclean) and the (definitely) unclean. R. Eliezer says: Each is to be burned by itself. [R. Eliezer holds that one is exhorted to guard the doubtful (against uncleanliness), it being written (Numbers 18:8): \"the guarding of my terumoth\" — The Torah speaks of two terumoth: one, doubtful; one, clean.] R. Yehoshua says: They are both burned together. [Since its status is doubtful, you are not exhorted to guard it. And they do not differ on the burning of the doubtful and the clean together, for since it is not definitely unclean, the impression is not given that he is making clean terumah unclean.]"

            "\tSo long as he is permitted to eat, he feeds it to beasts, animals, and birds. [The fact that we do not have (the uniform structure): \"So long as he eats, he feeds,\" but the dual structure, indicates that two (different) men are intended, viz.: \"So long as a Cohein is permitted to eat terumah, an Israelite may feed chullin to his beast,\" our Mishnah being in accordance with R. Gamliel, who says (1:5): \"Chullin is eaten all four hours, and terumah, all five.\" The halachah, however, is not in accordance with him, but both terumah and chullin are eaten all four, \"suspended\" all of the fifth, and burned at the beginning of the sixth.] (\"he feeds it to beasts, animals, and birds\":) [It is necessary to state all. For if only \"beasts\" were stated, we would assume that with a beast, where what is left over can be seen and burned, it is permitted; but with an animal, such as a marten, a cat, and a weasel, where what is left over is generally hidden, it is forbidden. (We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise.) And if only \"animals\" were stated, we would assume that it is permitted because an animal hides what it leaves over, so that the owner is not in transgression of \"bal yeraeh\" (\"It may not be seen\"); but if a beast leaves something over, the owner might not remember to burn it and he would be in transgression of \"bal yeraeh,\" so that I might think it were forbidden. We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise. And since we are taught \"beasts\" and \"animals,\" we are also taught \"birds.\"] And he may sell it to a gentile, [as opposed to the view of Beth Shammai, who say that one is forbidden to sell his chametz to a gentile unless he knows that he will finish it before Pesach, an Israelite being commanded to remove it from the world and (to see to it) that it not remain.], and it is permitted to derive benefit from it [i.e., from its ashes. If he burned it before the time that it is forbidden, he is permitted to derive benefit from its ashes even after the time that it is forbidden.] Once its time has passed, [i.e., when the sixth hour has arrived, even though it is only rabbinically interdicted], it is forbidden to derive benefit from it, [just as if derivation of benefit were prohibited by the Torah. So that if he betrothed a woman with it, we do not grant validity to his betrothal. And even hardened chametz, such as grain on which (roof-) drippings have fallen, which even on Pesach itself is only rabbinically interdicted — if he betrothed a woman with it on the fourteenth (of Nissan) when the sixth hour had arrived, we grant no validity to his betrothal.], and he may not kindle oven or stove with it. [This must be stated vis-à-vis R. Yehudah, who says that there is no removal of chametz but burning. We might think that while burning it one could derive benefit from it. We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise, that even in the (regular) course of its removal it is forbidden to derive benefit from it once the time of its prohibition has arrived.] R. Yehudah says: There is no removal of chametz but burning [He derives it from \"nothar\" (left-over sacrificial portions), from which benefit may not be derived, which is punishable by kareth, like chametz, and which is commanded to be burned, and not (to be disposed of) in any other manner.]; and the sages say: It is also permitted to scatter it to the winds or cast it into the sea. [The rabbis do not derive it from nothar, for this (derivation) is controverted by (the law of) a stoned ox, which though forbidden for eating and derivation of benefit, and punishable by kareth, does not require burning.]",
            "\tIt is permitted to derive benefit from the chametz of a gentile over which Pesach has passed. [This is not to say that it is forbidden to eat it — but since it is to be taught: \"and it is forbidden to derive benefit from that of an  Israelite,\" the antithesis is stated in respect to a gentile. Or else, because there are some who forbid to themselves the bread of a gentile, it is not stated explicitly: \"It is permitted to eat the chametz of a gentile.\"]; and it is forbidden to derive benefit from that of an Israelite, it being written (Exodus 13:7): \"Se'or (leaven) shall not be seen unto you.\" [That is, he is penalized for having transgressed \"Se'or shall not be seen unto you.\" Or else, this refers to the beginning, viz.: \"The chametz of a gentile is permitted,\" it being written: \"Se'or shall not be seen unto you,\" which is expounded: What is yours, you may not see, but you may see what is a gentile's.]",
            "\tIf a gentile lent an Israelite [money] on his (the Israelite's) chametz [before Pesach, and the Israelite said to him: \"If I have not repaid you by this and this date, acquire it from now,\" and he left the pledge in the gentile's home, where it remained all of Pesach], after Pesach, he may derive benefit from it. [For since the time arrived and he did not pay him, the chametz, being in the gentile's domain, did not lack \"claiming,\" so that it is seen retroactively that at the time he pledged it with him, it was his (the gentile's)]. And if an Israelite lent a gentile on his (the gentile's) chametz — after Pesach, he may not derive benefit from it. [For it is seen retroactively that it was the Israelite's.] If debris falls upon chametz, it is considered removed, [notwithstanding which he must nullify it, lest the mound be removed on the festival and he be found to have transgressed.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Whatever a dog cannot search after (is considered removed). [How much can a dog search after? (A distance of) three handbreadths.]",
            "\tIf one eats terumah of chametz on Pesach unwittingly [If he were unwitting in respect to the terumah, even if he were witting in respect to the chametz], he pays the principal and a fifth, [even though it is forbidden to derive enjoyment from chametz on Pesach, and it is worth nothing. For in respect to one who eats terumah unwittingly it is written (Leviticus 22:14): \"And he shall give to the Cohein the holy thing\" — something which can become holy — not money, but fruit. And what is paid becomes terumah, so that it is not the monetary worth that is being paid.] (If he eats it) wittingly, [If he were witting in respect to the terumah, even if he were unwitting in respect to the chametz], he is exempt from payment and from the worth of the wood. [If it were unclean terumah, he does not pay the worth of the wood, which can be used as fuel for cooking. For if he were witting in respect to the terumah, he is like any other robber, and he pays money, relative to worth and not relative to amount. But chametz on Pesach has no worth, for benefit may not be derived from it, and it is also forbidden as fuel, so that he has caused no loss (to the Cohein).]",

[(If this were not stated) I might have thought that matzah which is fit for all men is required, but challah and terumah are not fit for non-priests. We are, therefore, apprised otherwise.] The challoth of the todah (the thanksgiving offering) and the wafers of the Nazirite's offering — If one made them for himself, [even though they are bona fide matzah], he does not fulfill his obligation with them, [it being written (Exodus 12:17): \"And you shall watch the matzoth\" — matzah which is watched for the sake of matzah; to exclude these, which are not watched for the sake of matzah, but for the sake of the offering.]; if he made them to sell them in the marketplace, he fulfills his obligation with them.

One fulfils his obligation with them whether they are wet or dry [specifically with their stalk, as stated below. But with leaves, (he fulfills his obligation) only with wet ones, but not with dry ones.] But they may not be preserved (in vinegar), and they may not be boiled to a pulp, and they may not be cooked.

Meir forbids it [even if he puts it into mustard, holding that it becomes chametz in mustard immediately, as in charoseth. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Meir.

R. Eliezer says: Also the adornments of women (tachshitei nashim). [R. Eliezer is hereby adding (to the categories). For the first tanna enumerates only absolute grain chametz in admixture or hardened chametz in itself. And R. Eliezer adds even tachshitei nashim, which is hardened chametz in admixture with other ingredients. The gemara asks: \"Tachshitei nashim\"? (i.e., What do adornments have to do with chametz? And it answers:) \"Say, rather: 'tifulei nashim,'\" the meal that women apply (tofloth) to their skin with other herbs to remove hair or to whiten and smooth the skin. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.] This is the rule: Whatever is of a variety of grain must be removed on Pesach, [if it is one of the five varieties mixed with water. For if there is no water, but only fruit juice, the ruling is that fruit juice dos not produce chametz.], they are subsumed in the exhortation [i.e., if one eats them he transgresses a negative commandment], and they are not subject to kareth. [For only complete chametz is subject to kareth and not an admixture. But he receives stripes if he eats an olive-size of chametz in an admixture in the amount of time it takes to eat a p'ras (half a loaf) and if he does not, he does not receive stripes by Torah law.

[If a sheretz touched this dough on Pesach (\"whose prohibition gives it significance\") — if there is an olive-size of dough, it acts as a partition against tumah (i.e., against tumah being imparted to the areivah). It is not considered as (part of) the areivah, and tumah is not transferred to it. With less than an olive-size — if he is not concerned about it, it is voided to the areivah; it is considered as if the sheretz had touched the areivah itself, and it becomes tamei.] If he is concerned about it (i.e., about its being there), it is a partition; and if he wants it there, it is like the areivah. [This is what is meant: And on the other days of the year, \"when its prohibition does not give it significance,\" it depends not upon the size (of the dough), whether or not it is an olive-size, but upon his concern. If he is concerned about its being there and will eventually remove it from there, it is a partition against the (transference of the) tumah, whether or not it is an olive-size, and it does not confer tumah upon the areivah. And if he is not concerned about it and wishes it to remain there, even if it contains several olive-sizes, it is like part of the areivah, and when the sheretz touches the dough, it is as if it touches the areivah itself.] Batzek hacheresh (\"deaf-mute\" dough) [which when struck with the hand does not emit a sound, like a deaf-mute, who is called and does not answer.

[i.e., If the dough has become unclean, so that the challah taken from it is not fit for consumption by a Cohein, how can it be separated on the festival of Pesach? It cannot be baked on Pesach, for it is not fit for consumption. It cannot be left over to be burned at night, for it might become chametz. It is not permitted to feed it to dogs, for it is forbidden to destroy consecrated food on a festival.] R. Eliezer says: Let him not call it by name (\"challah\") until it is baked, [so that each (loaf) is fit for him, for from each loaf he separates a little. And after it is baked, if he wishes, he can separate the complete challah for all. For R. Eliezer holds that if one takes (loaves) from the oven and places them into a basket, they all combine for (purposes of) challah.] R. Yehudah says: Let it (the separated dough) be placed in cold water (so that it not become chametz.)] R. Yehoshua said: This is not the chametz that we are exhorted against in bal yeraeh and bal yimatzeh. [For it is not his after he calls it by name, and it is written (Exodus 13:7): \"…shall not be seen unto you\" — What is yours, you may not see, but you may see that of others and that of the Exalted. And this is neither yours not that of your neighbor, not yet having reached the hand of the Cohein. And R. Eliezer holds, that since if he wishes, he can ask (absolution for his dedication), it is dedication in error, therefore, not dedication, and thus, fit for him to eat and (regarded as) the chametz of an Israelite. And R. Yehoshua holds that we do not say: \"Since if he wishes, etc.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer.]",

Gamliel says: Three women may knead (dough) together [each enough for a full oven, and need not fear that it will become chametz, even though one must wait until two have baked], and they bake in one oven, one after the other. And the sages say: Three women occupy themselves with the dough [i.e., Not so much leniency is to be exercised as to permit them to knead at the same time, but each occupies herself with her own dough]: one [the last one] kneads, one [the middle one] forms, and one [the third one, who kneaded first,] bakes. [So that each of the three is found to be occupying herself with her dough at the same time: one kneading her dough, one forming her dough, one baking her dough.] R. Akiva says: Not all women, and not all wood, and not all stoves are the same. ] R. Akiva refers to the statement of R. Gamliel, saying that it is not advisable to do as he says, for some women are lazy and the dough will become chametz if they take too much time, and some stoves do not heat so quickly, and some wood does not burn so quickly. Rather, the view of the sages should be followed — that they should be constantly occupied with the dough; for so long as they do so, it does not become chametz.

The sages say: One who eats either incurs kareth, [\"like the horns of hoppers\" also being \"sidduk.\" ] Which is \"siur\" [for which one is not liable]?

Tzaddok says: Terumah (is burned) before Shabbath, [for he can feed it neither to non-priests nor to beasts, and it is not permitted to let it stay], and chullin (is removed) in its time (i.e., on Shabbath), [for he can find many eaters for it.

It shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire\" — In the place of its eating is its burning.] And for what quantity [of remembered chametz or consecrated flesh] does he return? R. Meir says: For either, the size of an egg. [But if less — if chametz, he voids it in his heart; if consecrated flesh, he burns it in his place. R. Meir holds that \"its returning (i.e., the necessity of returning because of it) is as its tumah\" (uncleanliness). Just as the tumah of food is with the size of an egg, (food less than that size not becoming tamei), so its returning is not for less than that quantity.] R. Yehudah says: For either, the size of an olive.

And R. Yehudah says: \"You, too, go and bring\" from the variety that ended, as this man did — you will not find any. Therefore, he is permitted to eat only of the variety that did not end. For it is not permitted to eat varieties that ended on the strength of one that did not; and he must, therefore, remove all of them. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah re the dictum of R.

They (the Cohanim) sounded the tekiah, and the teruah, and the tekiah (on the shofroth.) The Cohanim stood row upon row, and in their hands were large vessels [for receiving the blood], (vessels) of silver and of gold — one row, all of silver; the other, all of gold [to add beauty to the occasion]; they were not intermixed. And the vessels had no bases [They were broad on top and came to a point on the bottom, so that they could not be rested on the ground], lest [the Cohanim] place them there [until they received additional blood (there being many offerings) and forget them] and the blood congeal [and not be fit for sprinkling.]",

And he receives the full one [from the giver first] and [then] returns the empty one. [But not in reverse order; but as soon as he extends it (the full one) to him, he must receive it, for \"mitzvoth are not to be passed over.\"] The Cohein nearest the altar gives it one fling [with the vessel itself, not sprinkling it with his finger (the only offering requiring this being the sin-offering, in respect to which it is written: \"with his finger\")] facing the base [i.e., on the sides of the altar above the base. He flings it to the perpendicular of the altar and it descends to the base. \"facing the base\" is stated in light of the fact that the base does not surround the entire altar, but only the north and the west, and \"consuming\" a cubit south and east, as explained in Middoth.]",

[When they started to slaughter (the Pesach), they started to recite the Hallel. If there were so many offerings that they finished the Hallel before they had finished slaughtering, and there were still many to slaughter, they would recite it a second time.] And if they recited it a second time [and the slaughtering of the offerings of that group had not yet been completed], they would recite it a third time, [and so with the second and third groups.] R.

When they wanted to douse it, they would plug up its outlet and the water would flow over the sides onto the entire azarah, after which they would unplug the outlet and the water would run out.] R. Yehudah says: He (a Cohein) would fill a cup from the mixed bloods [on the floor (of the azarah)] and fling it once against the altar; but the sages did not concur with him.

And if one had no place for suspending and flaying — there were thin, smooth [\"barked\"] sticks there, which he would place on his shoulder and the shoulder of his neighbor, and on which he would suspend and flay (the offering). R.

(Ibid. 28:2): \"…shall you observe to offer to Me in its appointed time.\" Just as \"in its appointed time\" of the tamid overrides the Sabbath, viz. (Ibid. 28:10): \"The burnt-offering of the Sabbath in its Sabbath, in addition to the tamid, etc.\", so, \"in its appointed time\" of the Pesach overrides the Sabbath]: its slaughtering, the sprinkling of its blood [These cannot be done at night, it being written in that regard (Leviticus 7:38): \"…on the day that He commanded to present, etc.\" — on the day, and not at night.], michui of its entrails [\"michui\" - \"cleaning out,\" as in (Proverbs 30:20): \"She eats and wipes (machthah) her mouth.\" The cleaning out of the entrails (so that they not putrefy) overrides the Sabbath], and the smoking of its fats. But its roasting and the rinsing out of its innards do not override the Sabbath, [for these can be done after dark]. Carrying it (the Paschal lamb) [on his shoulders to bring it through the public domain to the azarah — Even though only a (rabbinical) shvuth (\"resting\") interdict obtains (for \"a living thing carries itself\"), it does not override the Sabbath, for it should have been done the day before.], and [similarly] bringing it from outside the tchum (the Sabbath boundary), and the cutting off of its wart — these do not override the Sabbath. [The cutting off of the wart of a Pesach offering, to remove its blemish, even if it be only a shvuth transgression (as when he removes it with his teeth or his hand) does not override the Sabbath. As to our having learned (Eruvin 103a): \"A wart may be cut off in the Temple\" (on the Sabbath), that applies to a dry wart, which is brittle, whereas our Mishnah speaks of a moist wart. And notwithstanding the fact that when he removes it with his teeth or his hand, he is doing it in an unusual manner (kilacher yad), still, with a wet wart it is forbidden, for it could have been done the day before.] R. Eliezer says: They override the Sabbath, [ R. Eliezer holding (Shabbath 19a) that the \"enablers\" of a mitzvah override the Sabbath. ]",
            "\tR. Eliezer said: Should this not follow a fortiori, viz.: Now if slaughtering, which [though it is forbidden on Shabbath with chullin (i.e., for secular purposes)] being an absolute labor, [notwithstanding this,] it overrides the Sabbath [with the Pesach offering], — these (\"enablers\"), which are (forbidden by reason of) shvuth, should they not certainly override the Sabbath! R. Yehoshua said to him: This argument is overturned by (what obtains on) a festival, absolute labor [(like slaughtering and cooking) being permitted to all men], and shvuth activities being forbidden [e.g., They forbade the bringing of something from outside the tchum to be eaten, in that this could have been done the day before, even though tchum is a rabbinic ordinance]. R. Eliezer rejoined: What is this, Yehoshua? How can you compare reshuth (what is merely permitted) to mitzvah? [A man's eating is reshuth, but the requirement of the Most High is mitzvah. And if the sages established their shvuth interdict with reshuth, should they do so also with mitzvah! (And R. Yehoshua holds that all \"festival joy\" is mitzvah, in spite of which it does not override the Sabbath)]. R. Akiva answered and said: Haza'ah (the sprinkling of the purifying waters) will overturn (R. Eliezer's argument), viz.: Haza'ah is a mitzvah [in the instance of one who has become unclean through a dead body, whose seventh day (in the process of purification) falls out on Sabbath on Pesach eve. If he is not sprinkled upon he cannot bring his Pesach offering, in spite of which haza'ah does not override the Sabbath, this being the ruling espoused by R. Akiva], and haza'ah is shvuth, [a man seeming to be \"amended\" thereby], and it does not override the Sabbath! Therefore, you, too, should not wonder about these (\"enablers\"). Even though they (the \"enablers\" of the Pesach offering) are mitzvah, and they are shvuth factors, they do not override the Sabbath. R. Eliezer rejoined: But I question that, too [i.e., I differ on haza'ah, too, and I contend that it should override the Sabbath so that it not keep him from the Pesach — from this a fortiori argument itself], viz.: Now if slaughtering, which is an absolute labor, overrides the Sabbath, haza'ah which is (only) a shvuth interdict, should it not certainly override the Sabbath! R. Akiva rejoined: Or turn it around [i.e., I can turn the argument around. (For it was axiomatic to R. Akiva that haza'ah kept one back from the Pesach offering, so that it could be reasoned a fortiori that slaughtering should also keep him back)], viz.: Now if haza'ah, which is (only) a shvuth interdict, does not override the Sabbath, slaughtering, which is an (absolute) labor — how much more so should it not override the Sabbath! R. Eliezer rejoined: Akiva, you have uprooted what is written in the Torah, viz. (Numbers 9:3): \"towards evening, in its appointed time\" [(Ibid. 2)): \"Let the children of Israel offer the Pesach in its appointed time\"], whether on a weekday or on the Sabbath. R. Akiva answered: My master, bring me \"an appointed time\" for these (\"enablers\")! [i.e., Show me that they have an appointed time as slaughtering does. Therefore, since they have no appointed time, and they could have been performed the day before, they do not override. (And haza'ah, too, is not a function of the Pesach offering itself, and \"an appointed time\" is not written in respect to it.) The halachah is in accordance with R. Akiva.] R. Akiva stated a rule: Any labor which could have been done Sabbath eve does not override the Sabbath. Slaughtering (of the Pesach), which could not have been done Sabbath eve, overrides the Sabbath.",
            "\tWhen does one bring a chagigah (a festival offering) with it [with the Pesach on the fourteenth of Nissan]? When it (the fourteenth) falls on a weekday, (when the people are) in (a state of) cleanliness [For even though the Pesach overrides the Sabbath and uncleanliness, the chagigah does not], and with a small amount [i.e., when there is not enough of the Pesach to be eaten by the entire company, so that the chagigah is eaten first in order that their satiety be achieved with the Pesach]. And on the Sabbath, with a large amount [i.e., when the company is so small that the Pesach alone suffices for them], and in uncleanliness, a chagigah is not brought with it.",

And all other sacrifices which he slaughtered as a Pesach — If they are not fit [as a Pesach offering, such as a calf or a two-year-old ram, or a female], he is liable [for a sin-offering, if he forgot that it was Shabbath or if he thought that it was permitted to slaughter other sacrifices as a Pesach on Shabbath. For this is not \"erring in a matter of mitzvah,\" all knowing that these (i.e., such animals) are not kasher as a Pesach.] And if they are fit, [as when he slaughtered a one-year-old shelamim (peace-offering) lamb as a Pesach, erring in this because of his preoccupation with the slaughtering of his Pesach, and not remembering that he had dedicated it as a different sacrifice], R. Eliezer says that he is liable (for a sin-offering) [even though he has \"erred in a matter of mitzvah\"]; and R. Yehoshua says that he is not liable, [holding that if one erred in a matter of mitzvah and yet performed some mitzvah, he is not liable for a sin-offering. And this one performed a mitzvah, for he sacrificed an offering. For all offerings sacrificed lo lishman are kasher. And R. Yehoshua rules (Pesachim 62b) that even those which are slaughtered as a Pesach are kasher.] R. Eliezer said to him: Now if the Pesach, which it is permitted [to slaughter on Shabbath] lishmo, if he changes its name, [you nevertheless admit] that he is liable [for a sin-offering, as we learned above] — (other) sacrifices, which are forbidden (on Shabbath) lishman, if he changes their name, should it not follow, all the more, that he is liable! R. Yehoshua rejoined: No, in the instance of the Pesach, he changed the name to something which is forbidden [i.e., he slaughtered it in the name of a different offering, which it is forbidden to slaughter on Shabbath], whereas in the instance of the other sacrifices, where he changed the name to something which is permitted, [i.e., where he slaughtered it as something (a Pesach) which it is permitted to slaughter on Shabbath], (say that he is not liable for an offering)! R. Eliezer rejoined: (Offerings) specified for the congregation [on Shabbath, such as temidim and mussafim overturn your argument], it being permitted to slaughter them lishman, and yet if one slaughters [other sacrifices] in their name (i.e., as communal offerings), he is liable (for a sin-offering)! R. Yehoshua rejoined: No, in the instance of offerings specified for the congregation there is a set number [He does not see others involved in slaughtering, and once the tamid has been slaughtered, he knows that there is no need to slaughter another, so that (if he does) he is not \"erring\" but \"unwitting,\" for he should not err in such a thing.], whereas in the instance of Pesach, there is no set amount, [for everyone requires it. So that he sees many people busied with it and he becomes preoccupied with the mitzvah. And even if he had already slaughtered a Pesach and found this animal standing in the azarah and thought it was a Pesach and slaughtered it for someone else, this is \"erring in a matter of mitzvah\"] (and he should not be liable for a sin-offering). R. Meir says: Also one who slaughters [on Shabbath other offerings, all the days of the year] as an offering specified for the congregation, is not liable. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehoshua and it is not in accordance with R. Meir.]",

If he slaughtered it and he discovered it to be blemished, he is liable (for a sin-offering) [for he is shogeg (\"unwitting\") and not anuss (\"constrained\"), for he should have inspected it (before he slaughtered it).] If he slaughtered it and found it to be treifah in a hidden part (which he could not have inspected beforehand), he is not liable. If he slaughtered it and found out that the owners had \"withdrawn their hands\" [from it before it was slaughtered and had numbered themselves with a different offering], or if they had died or become unclean, [in which instance Shabbath is not overridden for them], he is not liable, having slaughtered with permission [i.e., He is regarded as \"anuss,\" not having known that this was the case and not having been expected to inquire about it.]"

The reason we have \"Five things\" and not \"Communal offerings\" is to exclude all of the festival offerings, which are like communal offerings in that they come \"in a crowd,\" in a gathering of fellows for the festival; yet they do not override uncleanliness, just as they do not override the Sabbath.] (The five things:) the omer, the two breads, the show-bread, the congregational peace-offerings [the atzereth (Shavuoth) lambs, there being no other congregational peace-offerings], and the Rosh Chodesh goats.

[This, in an instance where she had not been in the habit of always \"running\" to her father's house until now, so that we are in doubt as to her preference.] An orphan for whom caretakers slaughtered [If he had two caretakers and each numbered him for his Pesach], he eats wherever he wishes. A bondsman of two partners eats of neither. [For who granted that the one's half be numbered with the other? There is no amendment for him unless the two agree that he be numbered with one of them.] One who is half bondsman-half free does not eat of his master's, [but of his own.

The gemara construes this as applying only to king and queen — some say (that the rationale of their eating the first, etc. is) the fostering of peace in the kingdom; others, because they rely upon their bondsmen and are not particular as to whether they eat kids or lambs. Therefore, not being particular, they eat of the first, fulfilling the obligation therewith. But men in general, who are particular, may eat neither of the first nor of the second, the ruling being that one may not be numbered on two Pesachim at the same time to eat of whichever he likes. For there is no breirah (retroactive discrimination), so that when he wishes to eat of the one, we entertain the reservation that perhaps at the time of slaughtering he did not intend that one.] If he forgot what his master had told him [i.e., He told him \"kid\" or \"lamb,\" but he forgot which], what does he do? He slaughters the lamb and the kid and says: \"If my master said 'kid,' the kid is his and the lamb is mine; and if my master said 'lamb,' the lamb is his and the kid is mine.\" [The gemara construes this as an instance of one's having gone to a shepherd who was his master's familiar and who, desiring his (the master's) amendment, said to him (the servant): \"If your master said 'kid,' the kid is his and the lamb is yours on condition that your master have no rights in it,\" in which instance the bondsman acquires it. For if not so, whatever the bondsman acquires is acquired by the master, so that both would be his master's.] If his master forgot what he had said to him, both (kid and lamb) are burned, and they (master and bondsman) have no Pesach sheni obligation.

We are speaking of a prison of idolators, where even if they had promised to release him, we fear that they will not do so — (Psalms 144:8): \"…whose mouths speak deceit, etc.\" But if one is imprisoned by Israel (i.e., by beth-din), e.g., to force him to divorce a woman who is unfit for him or to pay money (that he owes), it is permitted to slaughter for them even by themselves if they promised to release them — for (Tzephaniah 3:13): \"the remnant of Israel … will not speak deceit.\" And if the prison were in Jerusalem, even if they were imprisoned by idolators, the Pesach may be slaughtered for them alone, for it can be brought to the prison and eaten there. And it is not slaughtered for the sick and the old by themselves lest their illness become aggravated and they not be able to eat an olive-size.] Therefore, [since when it was slaughtered for them they were fit, and the blood was sprinkled for them], if they became unfit [as explained above], they do not have a Pesach sheni obligation — except for the one who dug out a mound, [under which a dead man was found, in which instance he does have a Pesach sheni obligation], for he was unclean from the beginning [i.e., before it was slaughtered; for he \"tented over the uncleanliness from the time he began digging.

That is, the criterion is eating (and not number). If one individual can eat an olive-size, a Pesach is slaughtered for him.

And Beth Shammai hold that we do not decree thus. But in respect to an uncircumcised Jew (as when his brothers died because of circumcision), all agree that he immerses and eats his Pesach at night, and we do not decree \"an uncircumcised Jew by reason of an uncircumcised gentile.\"]"

[Scripture exempts one who was unclean or on a distant way from offering the first Pesach, and kareth, essentially, is for the first Pesach. Therefore, if they did not offer the second Pesach, they are exempt from kareth.

This one [Reuven] comes to this [Pesach taken by Shimon], and that one [Shimon] comes to that [Pesach taken by Reuven]. And this is what they say: [This is what Reuven says to Yehudah, who remains with the Pesach taken by Shimon:] \"If this Pesach is mine\" [i.e., If I did not choose correctly, and this is not the Pesach for which you were numbered with Shimon], then withdraw from yours and be numbered with me on [this, which is] mine. And if this Pesach is yours, [Shimon having chosen correctly], then I withdraw from mine and am numbered [with you] on [this, which is] yours.\" [The reason each one must number with himself someone from the marketplace is that if they came to stipulate thus between themselves and to say: \"If this Pesach is mine and yours is yours, then we have chosen correctly; and if not, I withdraw from mine and number myself with yours,\" then, when he withdraws from his, he leaves his Pesach without an owner, none having yet been numbered for it. And each cannot be numbered together with the other before he withdraws from his, for one cannot be numbered on two Pesachim at the same time, this not satisfying (slaughtering the Pesach for) \"Those numbered for it.\"]"

            "\tOn Pesach eve before minchah [i.e., a little before minchah, about a half hour, in the beginning of the tenth hour. For the tamid is sacrificed at nine and a half hours, which is the time of the minchah, so that a half hour before minchah is at the beginning of the tenth hour], one may not eat until it gets dark, [so that he eat matzah \"with appetite,\" for hiddur mitzvah (\"the gracing of the mitzvah\"). It goes without saying that he may not eat bread, for chametz is forbidden from six hours on. And (he may not eat) matzah, too, as stated in Yerushalmi: \"Eating matzah on Pesach eve is like living with one's betrothed in the house of his in-laws.\" The intent is, rather, that he may not eat any food, that he not \"fill his belly\" with it.] And even a poor man in Israel may not eat (the Pesach feast) without reclining [at table on a bolster, in the manner of free men], and they [charity collectors, who provide for the poor] may not provide him with fewer than four cups of wine — even [one who is supported] by the tamchui (the community dole) [i.e., the poorest of the poor, viz. (Peah): \"If one has enough for two meals, he may not take from the tamchui.\"]",
            "\tThey poured the first cup for him. Beth Shammai say: He first blesses over the day [the kiddush of the day] and then over the wine [\"bori p'ri hagafen\"]. For first comes the sanctification of the day, and then, the wine. And just as its entry precedes, so does its blessing.] And Beth Hillel say: First he blesses over the wine, and then he blesses over the day. [The same holds for one who makes kiddush on a loaf (instead of on wine). For it is the wine or the loaf that occasion the kiddush of the day, there being no kiddush in the absence of wine or loaf.]",
            "\tThey brought before him [greens, so that the child notice it and ask about it (for it was not the practice to bring greens before the meal)]. He dips the chazereth [Not necessarily chazereth, for this first dipping was with other greens; but if there were no other greens, he dips chazereth instead. \"Dipping\" here means \"eating.\" (Since all of their eating was with dipping, eating was called \"dipping\") This dipping, however, was not in charoseth. (Its being stated afterwards: \"They brought before him matzah, chazereth, and charoseth\" indicates that the charoseth had not yet been brought)] until he comes to the eating of the loaf [i.e., the eating of the matzah. We are here apprised that no other eating intervenes between the eating of greens and the eating of matzah, that before he comes to that chazereth of mitzvah on which he blesses \"al achilath maror,\" he first eats matzah, as it is written (Numbers 9:11): \"With matzoth and merorim (biter herbs) shall they eat it\" — first matzoth, then merorim.] They brought before him matzah, chazereth, charoseth [made from figs, hazel-nuts, pistachio nuts, and almonds and an assortment of fruits. They would place apples into it, pound it all in a mortar, mix it with vinegar, and place upon it spices, calamus reed, and cinnamon — long, thin strips, in remembrance of the straw (of Egypt). And it (the charoseth) must be thick, in remembrance of the lime (of Egypt)], and two dishes — even though charoseth is not a mitzvah [but a health-aid, to neutralize the acridity of the chazereth, which is \"as sore as venom\" to the body.] R. Eliezer b. Tzaddok says: It is a mitzvah [in remembrance of the apple (orchard) where they would give birth without travail, and in remembrance of the lime.] And in (the time of) the Temple, they would bring before him the Pesach (offering) itself.",
            "\tThey poured the second cup for him. And here (kan) the son asks his father [In all of the texts it is not written \"kan,\" but \"ken,\" as in (Numbers 27:7): \"Ken (Rightly) the daughters of Tzelafchad speak.\" That is, it is right that at the pouring of the second cup the son should ask:] \"Why is this night different from all (other) nights? For on all nights, we eat chametz and matzah; this night, only matzah. For on all nights, we eat all greens; this night, maror. For on all nights we eat flesh roasted, boiled, and cooked; this night, only roasted.\" [The son would ask thus when the Temple was standing.] \"For on all nights, we dip once; this night, twice.\" And according to the understanding of the son, his father teaches him. He begins with the obloquy [\"From the beginning, our forefathers were idolators and we were slaves, etc.\"] and he ends with praise [\"G d drew us close to His service and redeemed our fathers from Egypt.\"], and he expounds from \"A wandering Aramean was my father\" until he concludes the entire section.",
            "\tR. Gamliel was wont to say: Whoever does not say these three things on Pesach [i.e., whoever does not give the reasons for these three things] has not fulfilled his obligation: Pesach, matzah, and maror. Pesach — because the L rd \"passed over\" (pasach) the houses of our forefathers in Egypt. Matzah — because our forefathers were redeemed from Egypt. Maror — because the Egyptians embittered (mareru) the lives of our forefathers in Egypt. In every generation one must see himself as if he went forth from Egypt, viz. (Exodus 13:8): \"And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: 'Because of this the L rd wrought for me when I went forth from Egypt.'\" Therefore, we are obligated to thank, praise, extol, glorify, exalt, beatify, bless, upraise, and acclaim Him who wrought for our forefathers and for us all of these miracles. He delivered us from slavery to freedom, from sorrow to joy, from mourning to festivity, from pitch darkness to a great light, and from subjugation to redemption — and we shall say before Him \"Hallelukah!\"",
            "\tHow far does he say? Beth Shammai say: Until (Psalms 113:9): \"a joyous mother of sons.\" Beth Hillel say: Until (Ibid. 114:8): \"…a flint into a fountain of waters,\" and he ends with redemption. [That is, he concludes the hagadah with the blessing of redemption.] R. Tarfon says: \"…who redeemed us and redeemed our forefathers from Egypt,\" without a concluding blessing. R. Akiva says: \"So may the L rd our G d and the G d of our fathers bring us to other holidays and festivals that are approaching us, for peace — rejoicing in the building of Your city and regaling in Your service; and we shall eat there of the sacrifices and of the Pesachim — Blessed are You, O L rd, who redeemed Israel.\" [The first tanna did not explain the nature of the blessing, and R. Tarfon and R. Akiva come to explain it. R. Tarfon says that he opens with \"Blessed\" and does not close with \"Blessed,\" as in the blessing over fruits and over mitzvoth, it all being one thanksgiving. And according to R. Akiva, he (also) closes with \"Blessed,\" for he adds to it words of ingratiation and imploration, viz.: \"So may He bring us, etc.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Akiva.]",
            "\tThey poured the third cup for him. He recites grace. The fourth cup. He concludes the Hallel over it and he recites \"the blessing of the song.\" [Some say that this is \"Nishmath kol chai\"; others, that it is \"Yehallelucha Hashem kol ma'asecha.\" The custom is to say both.] Between these cups (the first two and the last two), if he wishes to drink, he may. Between the third and fourth, he may not drink, [lest he become inebriated and be unable to conclude the Hallel. And if one would ask: Might he not already be inebriated, having drunk his fill in the midst of the meal? (The answer:) Wine in the midst of the meal does not inebriate; wine after the meal does.]",
            "\tVe'en maftirin after the Pesach afikoman. [I have heard this (\"maftirin\") explained as in (Psalms 22:8): \"Yaftiru besafa\" (\"They open and say\"). My rabbis understood it in the sense of \"haniftar mechavero\" (taking leave of one's friend), i.e., when one \"takes leave\" of the meal, it should not be concluded by saying \"Afikoman\" (acronymic for) \"Afiku manaichu\" (\"Take out your utensils\"), i.e., \"Take your utensils from here and let us go and eat elsewhere.\" One may not do this in order to eat loaf (i.e., matzah) or anything else — a decree lest one come to eat of the Pesach in two places. But to eat other things in one's original place is permitted, so long as he does not leave his company to eat them with a different company. And there is a view in the gemara according to which \"afikoman\" is understood as \"Afiku minei metika\" (\"Bring out kinds of sweets\"). After eating the Pesach they are not to \"take leave\" of the meal by partaking of sweets and fruits, which they were wont to eat as dessert. (They are not permitted to do so) even in their place, so that the taste of the Pesach not leave their mouths. This is the essential interpretation. And just as \"ein maftirin after the Pesach afikoman,\" so \"ein maftirin after matzah afikoman.\" That is, when there is no Pesach, one must eat an olive-size of matzah at the end. And after that matzah, one may not take leave of it with the eating of something else.] If some of them slept, they may resume eating; if all of them slept, they may not resume eating. [If they began eating their Pesach, and all of them fell asleep, they may not resume eating (when they awake), the impression thereby being given of eating in two places. For their sleeping interrupts their intent to continue eating, so that it (eating when they awake) is like eating in two places. This is just a stringency (of observance and not the essential halachah). The same holds for matzah at this time.] R. Yossi says: If they slumbered, they may eat; if they fell asleep, they may not eat. [This refers to the first tanna's statement: \"If some of them slept, they may resume eating.\" R. Yossi comes to tell us that this is so only if they slumbered but did not actually fall asleep. But if some of them fell asleep, they (those who fell asleep) may not resume eating when they awake. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.]",
            "\tThe Pesach, after midnight, renders one's hands unclean. [For it is nothar from midnight on. And the rabbis decreed that nothar render one's hands unclean so that they not be lax in eating it. And whence is it derived that the Pesach is nothar after midnight? For it is written (Exodus 12:8): \"And they shall eat the flesh on this night,\" and (Ibid. 12): \"And I shall pass through the land of Egypt on this night.\" Just as there (12), until midnight; here (8) too, until midnight.] Pigul and nothar render one's hands unclean. If he made the blessing for the Pesach [\"…who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to eat the Pesach\"], he exempts the sacrifice. If he made the blessing for the sacrifice [\"…who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to eat the sacrifice\"], he exempts the Pesach. [The \"sacrifice\" here is the festival offering (chagigah) of the fourteenth of Nissan.] These are the words of R. Yishmael. R. Akiva says: This does not exempt that and that does not exempt this. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Akiva.]"
