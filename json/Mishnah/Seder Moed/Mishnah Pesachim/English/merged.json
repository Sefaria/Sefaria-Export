            "On the evening of the fourteenth [of Nissan] we check for <i>chamets</i> [leavened grain products] by candlelight. Any place into which we do not bring <i>chamets</i> does not require checking. And why did [the Sages] say [that we must check up to] two rows in the wine cellar? [It is] a place which we bring leavened bread into. Beit Shammai says, \"Two rows upon the entire wine-cellar.\" But Beit Hillel says, \"The two outer rows, which are the uppermost.\"", 
            "We do not need to be concerned [that] perhaps a weasel dragged [<i>chamets</i>] from [one] house to [another] house, or from [one] place to [another] place. Since if [we were to be concerned, we would also need to be concerned that <i>chamets</i> was dragged] from [one] courtyard to [another] courtyard, and from [one] city to [another] city — there [would be] no end to the matter.", 
            "Rabbi Yehuda says, \"We check on the evening of the fourteenth, and on the fourteenth in the morning, and at the time of the destruction [of <i>chamets</i>].\" And the Sages say, \"If he did not check on the evening of the fourteenth, he must check on the [day of the] fourteenth. If he did not check on the fourteenth, he must check on [the intermediate days of] the festival. If he did not check on the festival, he must check after the festival.\" And what he leaves over [on the night of the fourteenth in order to eat on the morrow], he must put in a concealed place, in order that checking after it shall not be necessary.", 
            "Rabbi Meir says, \"We may eat [<i>chamets</i>] through all [the first] five [hours of the day], and we must burn [it] at the beginning of the sixth [hour].\" Rabbi Yehuda says, \"We may eat [it] through all [the first] four [hours of the day], we hold [it] in suspense through the fifth [hour], and we must burn it at the beginning of the sixth [hour].\"", 
            "Rabbi Yehudah also said, \"Two loaves of bread of a thank-offering [that had become] unfit were placed on the roof of the [Temple] portico. As long as they [both] lay [there], all the people would eat [<i>chamets</i>]. [When] one of them was removed, they would suspend and neither eat nor burn [their <i>chamets</i>]. [When] the second one of them was removed, all the people would begin burning [their <i>chamets</i>].\" Rabban Gamliel says, \"[<i>Chamets</i> that is] <i>chulin</i> [ food permitted for general consumption] may be eaten through all [the first] four [hours of the day]; but [<i>chamets</i> that is]  <i>terumah</i> [may be eaten even] through all [the first] five [hours of the day]; and we must burn [all <i>chamets</i>] at the beginning of the sixth [hour].\"", 
            "Rabbi Chanina, the adjunct head of the <i>Kohanim</i> [the priestly caste, a subgroup of tribe of Levi, which is uniquely responsible for maintaining and carrying out the sacrificial services in the Temple], said, \"During [all] the days of the <i>Kohanim</i>, they never refrained from burning [sacrificial] meat that had become impure by a secondary source of impurity [along] with [sacrificial] meat that had become impure by a primary source of impurity, even though it added impurity to impurity.\"  Rabbi Akiva added and said, \"During [all] the days of the <i>Kohanim</i>, they never refrained from lighting oil that had become unfit by [contact with] a <i>tevul yom</i> [a person who has immersed that day for purification but who must wait for night-fall to be fully pure] in a lamp that had become impure by one who had become impure by a corpse, even though they would [by so doing] add impurity to impurity.\"", 
            "Said Rabbi Meir, \"From their words we learn that we may burn <i> terumah</i> that is pure [but is <i>chamets</i>, together] with [<i> terumah</i>] that is impure on Pesach.\"  Rabbi Yose said to him, \"This is not analogous.  [Even] Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua concede that each is burned separately.  About what do they disagree?  About [<i>terumah</i> whose status of purity was] in question and impure [<i>terumah</i>], where Rabbi Eliezer says, 'Each must be burned separately;' and Rabbi Yehoshua says, 'Both [of them may be burned] together.'\""

            "\tSo long as he is permitted to eat, he feeds it to beasts, animals, and birds. [The fact that we do not have (the uniform structure): \"So long as he eats, he feeds,\" but the dual structure, indicates that two (different) men are intended, viz.: \"So long as a Cohein is permitted to eat terumah, an Israelite may feed chullin to his beast,\" our Mishnah being in accordance with R. Gamliel, who says (1:5): \"Chullin is eaten all four hours, and terumah, all five.\" The halachah, however, is not in accordance with him, but both terumah and chullin are eaten all four, \"suspended\" all of the fifth, and burned at the beginning of the sixth.] (\"he feeds it to beasts, animals, and birds\":) [It is necessary to state all. For if only \"beasts\" were stated, we would assume that with a beast, where what is left over can be seen and burned, it is permitted; but with an animal, such as a marten, a cat, and a weasel, where what is left over is generally hidden, it is forbidden. (We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise.) And if only \"animals\" were stated, we would assume that it is permitted because an animal hides what it leaves over, so that the owner is not in transgression of \"bal yeraeh\" (\"It may not be seen\"); but if a beast leaves something over, the owner might not remember to burn it and he would be in transgression of \"bal yeraeh,\" so that I might think it were forbidden. We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise. And since we are taught \"beasts\" and \"animals,\" we are also taught \"birds.\"] And he may sell it to a gentile, [as opposed to the view of Beth Shammai, who say that one is forbidden to sell his chametz to a gentile unless he knows that he will finish it before Pesach, an Israelite being commanded to remove it from the world and (to see to it) that it not remain.], and it is permitted to derive benefit from it [i.e., from its ashes. If he burned it before the time that it is forbidden, he is permitted to derive benefit from its ashes even after the time that it is forbidden.] Once its time has passed, [i.e., when the sixth hour has arrived, even though it is only rabbinically interdicted], it is forbidden to derive benefit from it, [just as if derivation of benefit were prohibited by the Torah. So that if he betrothed a woman with it, we do not grant validity to his betrothal. And even hardened chametz, such as grain on which (roof-) drippings have fallen, which even on Pesach itself is only rabbinically interdicted — if he betrothed a woman with it on the fourteenth (of Nissan) when the sixth hour had arrived, we grant no validity to his betrothal.], and he may not kindle oven or stove with it. [This must be stated vis-à-vis R. Yehudah, who says that there is no removal of chametz but burning. We might think that while burning it one could derive benefit from it. We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise, that even in the (regular) course of its removal it is forbidden to derive benefit from it once the time of its prohibition has arrived.] R. Yehudah says: There is no removal of chametz but burning [He derives it from \"nothar\" (left-over sacrificial portions), from which benefit may not be derived, which is punishable by kareth, like chametz, and which is commanded to be burned, and not (to be disposed of) in any other manner.]; and the sages say: It is also permitted to scatter it to the winds or cast it into the sea. [The rabbis do not derive it from nothar, for this (derivation) is controverted by (the law of) a stoned ox, which though forbidden for eating and derivation of benefit, and punishable by kareth, does not require burning.]", 
            "\tIt is permitted to derive benefit from the chametz of a gentile over which Pesach has passed. [This is not to say that it is forbidden to eat it — but since it is to be taught: \"and it is forbidden to derive benefit from that of an  Israelite,\" the antithesis is stated in respect to a gentile. Or else, because there are some who forbid to themselves the bread of a gentile, it is not stated explicitly: \"It is permitted to eat the chametz of a gentile.\"]; and it is forbidden to derive benefit from that of an Israelite, it being written (Exodus 13:7): \"Se'or (leaven) shall not be seen unto you.\" [That is, he is penalized for having transgressed \"Se'or shall not be seen unto you.\" Or else, this refers to the beginning, viz.: \"The chametz of a gentile is permitted,\" it being written: \"Se'or shall not be seen unto you,\" which is expounded: What is yours, you may not see, but you may see what is a gentile's.]", 
            "\tIf a gentile lent an Israelite [money] on his (the Israelite's) chametz [before Pesach, and the Israelite said to him: \"If I have not repaid you by this and this date, acquire it from now,\" and he left the pledge in the gentile's home, where it remained all of Pesach], after Pesach, he may derive benefit from it. [For since the time arrived and he did not pay him, the chametz, being in the gentile's domain, did not lack \"claiming,\" so that it is seen retroactively that at the time he pledged it with him, it was his (the gentile's)]. And if an Israelite lent a gentile on his (the gentile's) chametz — after Pesach, he may not derive benefit from it. [For it is seen retroactively that it was the Israelite's.] If debris falls upon chametz, it is considered removed, [notwithstanding which he must nullify it, lest the mound be removed on the festival and he be found to have transgressed.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Whatever a dog cannot search after (is considered removed). [How much can a dog search after? (A distance of) three handbreadths.]", 
            "\tIf one eats terumah of chametz on Pesach unwittingly [If he were unwitting in respect to the terumah, even if he were witting in respect to the chametz], he pays the principal and a fifth, [even though it is forbidden to derive enjoyment from chametz on Pesach, and it is worth nothing. For in respect to one who eats terumah unwittingly it is written (Leviticus 22:14): \"And he shall give to the Cohein the holy thing\" — something which can become holy — not money, but fruit. And what is paid becomes terumah, so that it is not the monetary worth that is being paid.] (If he eats it) wittingly, [If he were witting in respect to the terumah, even if he were unwitting in respect to the chametz], he is exempt from payment and from the worth of the wood. [If it were unclean terumah, he does not pay the worth of the wood, which can be used as fuel for cooking. For if he were witting in respect to the terumah, he is like any other robber, and he pays money, relative to worth and not relative to amount. But chametz on Pesach has no worth, for benefit may not be derived from it, and it is also forbidden as fuel, so that he has caused no loss (to the Cohein).]", 
            "\tThese are the things with which one fulfills his obligation [to eat matzoth] on [the first night of] Pesach, [when he is obligated to eat matzoth, viz. (Exodus 12:18): \"In the evening shall you eat matzoth\"]: with wheat, with barley, with spelt, with oats, and with fox-tail oats, [but not with rice, millet, and other species, it being written (Deuteronomy 16:3): \"You shall not eat chametz upon it; seven days shall you eat matzoth upon it.\" One fulfills his matzah obligation only with things susceptible of becoming chametz — to exclude rice, millet, and other species, which do not become chametz, but only putrefy.] And one fulfills his obligation with demai, and with ma'aser rishon whose terumah was taken, and with ma'aser sheni and hekdesh that were redeemed [The need for enumerating all of these is explained in the eighteenth chapter of Shabbath], and Cohanim (fulfill their obligation) with challah and with terumah. [(If this were not stated) I might have thought that matzah which is fit for all men is required, but challah and terumah are not fit for non-priests. We are, therefore, apprised otherwise.] The challoth of the todah (the thanksgiving offering) and the wafers of the Nazirite's offering — If one made them for himself, [even though they are bona fide matzah], he does not fulfill his obligation with them, [it being written (Exodus 12:17): \"And you shall watch the matzoth\" — matzah which is watched for the sake of matzah; to exclude these, which are not watched for the sake of matzah, but for the sake of the offering.]; if he made them to sell them in the marketplace, he fulfills his obligation with them. [For with whatever is to be sold in the marketplace, he says to himself: \"If I sell them, fine; if not, I will eat them as matzah of mitzvah.\"]", 
            "\tAnd these are the greens with which one fulfills his obligation (to eat maror - bitter herbs) on Pesach: with chazereth (lettuce), with endives, with tamcha [bast which grows around the palm tree], with charchavina (palm ivy), and with maror (bitter herb) [a kind of coriander which is especially bitter]. One fulfils his obligation with them whether they are wet or dry [specifically with their stalk, as stated below. But with leaves, (he fulfills his obligation) only with wet ones, but not with dry ones.] But they may not be preserved (in vinegar), and they may not be boiled to a pulp, and they may not be cooked. And they combine to an olive-size [for the fulfillment of the maror obligation. The same is true of the five species of grain. They combine to an olive-size for the fulfillment of the matzah obligation. Both are being referred to.] And one fulfills his obligation with their stalks, and with demai, and with ma'aser rishon whose terumah was taken, and with ma'aser sheni and hekdesh which were redeemed.", 
            "\tIt is forbidden to soak morsan (coarse bran) for chickens (on Pesach) [in cold water, and it goes without saying, in lukewarm water], but it may be stirred [in boiling water. For so long as the water is boiling, it cannot become chametz. And nowadays, even stirring with hot water is related to as forbidden.] A woman may not soak the morsan that she takes with her to the bath-house [to rub her flesh with, for it becomes chametz through soaking], but she may rub it dry on her flesh [even though her flesh is moist with water]. One may not chew wheat grain and place it on his sore on Pesach because it becomes chametz thereby.", 
            "\tFlour is not to be put into charoseth [something containing vinegar and water, into which meat is dipped] or into mustard. And if one put it [into mustard], he must eat it immediately. [For mustard is sharp and it does not become chametz very quickly as it does in charoseth. But with charoseth, the first tanna concurs with R. Meir that it is forbidden.] R. Meir forbids it [even if he puts it into mustard, holding that it becomes chametz in mustard immediately, as in charoseth. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Meir. The Pesach (i.e., the meat of the Pesach offering) is not to be cooked, [it being written (Exodus 12:9): \"…and cooked, cooked\" — in any way], neither in liquids nor in fruit juices. But it may be anointed and dipped in them [after being roasted, and we do not say that its taste is thereby neutralized. Or else, even before it is roasted, it is permitted to anoint the Pesach with fruit juice. For thus was it taught (7:3): \"If they anointed it with oil of terumah, if they were a company of Cohanim, they may eat it.\"] The water used by the baker [to cool his hands in when he forms the matzoth] should be spilled [down an incline, so that it not collect in one place] because it (thereby) becomes chametz."

            "\tThese are to be removed [\"from the world\"] on Pesach [For even though one does not transgress bal yeraeh because of them, the rabbis ordained that they be removed. As stated below (3:5): \"Siur (partially fermented dough) must be burned, even though one who eats it is not liable.\"], kutach habavli [made from mouldy bread and milk, in which they would dip food], shechar hamadi [beer that they would make in Madai from wheat or barley soaked in water ], chometz ha'adomi [ vinegar made in Edom, from barley placed in wine and left there until it fermented], zitom hamitzri [one-third barley, one-third wild saffron, one-third salt, made for healing purposes. Up to this point (there have been enumerated) varieties of chametz which are fit for eating in ta'aroveth (admixture). From this point on, hardened chametz in itself ], the zoma of dyers [water into which bran-flour is placed and which the dyers use in their work], the amil of cooks [a loaf made from the flour of grain less than one-third matured, used for covering pots to absorb vapors], and the kolan of scribes [mill-ground kneaded with water and used by scribes for gluing their papers]. R. Eliezer says: Also the adornments of women (tachshitei nashim). [R. Eliezer is hereby adding (to the categories). For the first tanna enumerates only absolute grain chametz in admixture or hardened chametz in itself. And R. Eliezer adds even tachshitei nashim, which is hardened chametz in admixture with other ingredients. The gemara asks: \"Tachshitei nashim\"? (i.e., What do adornments have to do with chametz? And it answers:) \"Say, rather: 'tifulei nashim,'\" the meal that women apply (tofloth) to their skin with other herbs to remove hair or to whiten and smooth the skin. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.] This is the rule: Whatever is of a variety of grain must be removed on Pesach, [if it is one of the five varieties mixed with water. For if there is no water, but only fruit juice, the ruling is that fruit juice dos not produce chametz.], they are subsumed in the exhortation [i.e., if one eats them he transgresses a negative commandment], and they are not subject to kareth. [For only complete chametz is subject to kareth and not an admixture. But he receives stripes if he eats an olive-size of chametz in an admixture in the amount of time it takes to eat a p'ras (half a loaf) and if he does not, he does not receive stripes by Torah law. However, a prohibition does obtain, any amount of an admixture of chametz on Pesach being forbidden.]", 
            "\tDough in the cracks of an areivah (a kneading trough) [used to reinforce fragments and splits] — If there is an olive-size (of dough) in one spot, he must remove it. If not, it is neutralized by its smallness. [And if it is not used for reinforcement, even less than an olive-size must be removed, for he does not void it there (to the areivah), and he might decide to take it from there.] The same applies to uncleanliness (tumah). [If a sheretz touched this dough on Pesach (\"whose prohibition gives it significance\") — if there is an olive-size of dough, it acts as a partition against tumah (i.e., against tumah being imparted to the areivah). It is not considered as (part of) the areivah, and tumah is not transferred to it. With less than an olive-size — if he is not concerned about it, it is voided to the areivah; it is considered as if the sheretz had touched the areivah itself, and it becomes tamei.] If he is concerned about it (i.e., about its being there), it is a partition; and if he wants it there, it is like the areivah. [This is what is meant: And on the other days of the year, \"when its prohibition does not give it significance,\" it depends not upon the size (of the dough), whether or not it is an olive-size, but upon his concern. If he is concerned about its being there and will eventually remove it from there, it is a partition against the (transference of the) tumah, whether or not it is an olive-size, and it does not confer tumah upon the areivah. And if he is not concerned about it and wishes it to remain there, even if it contains several olive-sizes, it is like part of the areivah, and when the sheretz touches the dough, it is as if it touches the areivah itself.] Batzek hacheresh (\"deaf-mute\" dough) [which when struck with the hand does not emit a sound, like a deaf-mute, who is called and does not answer. Another interpretation: \"Batzek hacheress\" (\"shard dough\") [which is as hard as a shard, so that it cannot be determined whether or not it has become chametz] — If there is aught like it which has become chametz, [i.e., if there is other dough which was kneaded at the same time as it was, and which has become chametz], it is forbidden, [and if there is not aught like it, then the standard (for its becoming chametz) is the amount of time it takes one to walk a mil at a normal pace, about two-fifths of an hour.]", 
            "\tHow is challah separated from tumah on a festival? [i.e., If the dough has become unclean, so that the challah taken from it is not fit for consumption by a Cohein, how can it be separated on the festival of Pesach? It cannot be baked on Pesach, for it is not fit for consumption. It cannot be left over to be burned at night, for it might become chametz. It is not permitted to feed it to dogs, for it is forbidden to destroy consecrated food on a festival.] R. Eliezer says: Let him not call it by name (\"challah\") until it is baked, [so that each (loaf) is fit for him, for from each loaf he separates a little. And after it is baked, if he wishes, he can separate the complete challah for all. For R. Eliezer holds that if one takes (loaves) from the oven and places them into a basket, they all combine for (purposes of) challah.] R. Yehudah says: Let it (the separated dough) be placed in cold water (so that it not become chametz.)] R. Yehoshua said: This is not the chametz that we are exhorted against in bal yeraeh and bal yimatzeh. [For it is not his after he calls it by name, and it is written (Exodus 13:7): \"…shall not be seen unto you\" — What is yours, you may not see, but you may see that of others and that of the Exalted. And this is neither yours not that of your neighbor, not yet having reached the hand of the Cohein. And R. Eliezer holds, that since if he wishes, he can ask (absolution for his dedication), it is dedication in error, therefore, not dedication, and thus, fit for him to eat and (regarded as) the chametz of an Israelite. And R. Yehoshua holds that we do not say: \"Since if he wishes, etc.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer.]", 
            "\tR. Gamliel says: Three women may knead (dough) together [each enough for a full oven, and need not fear that it will become chametz, even though one must wait until two have baked], and they bake in one oven, one after the other. And the sages say: Three women occupy themselves with the dough [i.e., Not so much leniency is to be exercised as to permit them to knead at the same time, but each occupies herself with her own dough]: one [the last one] kneads, one [the middle one] forms, and one [the third one, who kneaded first,] bakes. [So that each of the three is found to be occupying herself with her dough at the same time: one kneading her dough, one forming her dough, one baking her dough.] R. Akiva says: Not all women, and not all wood, and not all stoves are the same. ] R. Akiva refers to the statement of R. Gamliel, saying that it is not advisable to do as he says, for some women are lazy and the dough will become chametz if they take too much time, and some stoves do not heat so quickly, and some wood does not burn so quickly. Rather, the view of the sages should be followed — that they should be constantly occupied with the dough; for so long as they do so, it does not become chametz. And this is the halachah.] This is the rule: If [the dough in her hands] begins to rise, she should douse [her hands] in cold water [and form it so that it cools].",

Sidduk [When dough becomes chametz, it develops sedakim (slits)] must be burned, and one who eats it incurs kareth. Which is \"siur\"? Like the horns of hoppers [a slit here, a slit there]. \"Sidduk\" — intersecting slits. These are the word of R. Yehudah. The sages say: One who eats either incurs kareth, [\"like the horns of hoppers\" also being \"sidduk.\" ] Which is \"siur\" [for which one is not liable]? That [which has no slits, but] the surface of which is ashen, as one whose hair stands on end [from fright, his face turning ashen. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",

Meir. The sages say: (Everything is removed) in its time (i.e., on Shabbath). R. Eliezer b. Tzaddok says: Terumah (is burned) before Shabbath, [for he can feed it neither to non-priests nor to beasts, and it is not permitted to let it stay], and chullin (is removed) in its time (i.e., on Shabbath), [for he can find many eaters for it.

It shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire\" — In the place of its eating is its burning.] And for what quantity [of remembered chametz or consecrated flesh] does he return? R. Meir says: For either, the size of an egg. [But if less — if chametz, he voids it in his heart; if consecrated flesh, he burns it in his place. R. Meir holds that \"its returning (i.e., the necessity of returning because of it) is as its tumah\" (uncleanliness). Just as the tumah of food is with the size of an egg, (food less than that size not becoming tamei), so its returning is not for less than that quantity.] R. Yehudah says: For either, the size of an olive. [He holds that \"its returning is as its prohibition\" — Just as its prohibition is with an olive-size (one being liable for the eating of an olive-size of chametz  or consecrated flesh), so its returning is for an olive-size.] And the sages say: Consecrated flesh, for an olive-size; chametz, for the size of an egg. [Because of the gravity attaching to consecrated flesh, he returns even for an olive-size; but for chametz, which is chullin, he returns only for the size of an egg.

Yehudah says: We say to him: \"You, too, go and bring.\" [The argument of R. Yehudah and the first tanna centers around one who preserved three types of greens in vinegar or in brine. Two of them \"ended to the beast\" in the field; the third did not. The first tanna holds that he may eat from those which ended on the strength of those which did not end, since they are in one container. And this is the implication of: \"…from a place where they did not end to a place where they did end\" — entirely — \"he is obliged to remove them.\" But if not all of them ended, but only some of them, he eats also from the variety that ended so long as not all of them have ended, relying on the latter. And R. Yehudah says: \"You, too, go and bring\" from the variety that ended, as this man did — you will not find any. Therefore, he is permitted to eat only of the variety that did not end. For it is not permitted to eat varieties that ended on the strength of one that did not; and he must, therefore, remove all of them. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah re the dictum of R. Gamliel, the halachah being in accordance with him in tractate Shevi'ith (9:5)].",

Or else, sometimes he might sell it on Sabbath eve towards dark and shout to his beast so that it follow the purchaser, which if the beast does because it recognizes his voice, he is found to be \"mechamer\" (\"driving\") his beast on the Sabbath.] (And it is not permitted to sell them) calves or young asses, sound or broken, [For though they cannot be worked, they (i.e., selling them) might come to be confused with the selling of large beasts.

[For one who comes from abroad and one who is released from prison may cut his hair and wash his clothing on chol hamoed. And since we find a leniency on chol hamoed, on the fourteenth, which is of lesser sanctity, it is permitted to all.] R. Yossi b. Yehudah says: Even the cobblers.

R. Yehoshua said to him: This argument is overturned by (what obtains on) a festival, absolute labor [(like slaughtering and cooking) being permitted to all men], and shvuth activities being forbidden [e.g., They forbade the bringing of something from outside the tchum to be eaten, in that this could have been done the day before, even though tchum is a rabbinic ordinance]. R. Eliezer rejoined: What is this, Yehoshua? How can you compare reshuth (what is merely permitted) to mitzvah? [A man's eating is reshuth, but the requirement of the Most High is mitzvah. And if the sages established their shvuth interdict with reshuth, should they do so also with mitzvah! (And R. Yehoshua holds that all \"festival joy\" is mitzvah, in spite of which it does not override the Sabbath)]. R. Akiva answered and said: Haza'ah (the sprinkling of the purifying waters) will overturn (R. Eliezer's argument), viz.: Haza'ah is a mitzvah [in the instance of one who has become unclean through a dead body, whose seventh day (in the process of purification) falls out on Sabbath on Pesach eve. If he is not sprinkled upon he cannot bring his Pesach offering, in spite of which haza'ah does not override the Sabbath, this being the ruling espoused by R. Akiva], and haza'ah is shvuth, [a man seeming to be \"amended\" thereby], and it does not override the Sabbath! Therefore, you, too, should not wonder about these (\"enablers\"). Even though they (the \"enablers\" of the Pesach offering) are mitzvah, and they are shvuth factors, they do not override the Sabbath. R. Eliezer rejoined: But I question that, too [i.e., I differ on haza'ah, too, and I contend that it should override the Sabbath so that it not keep him from the Pesach — from this a fortiori argument itself], viz.: Now if slaughtering, which is an absolute labor, overrides the Sabbath, haza'ah which is (only) a shvuth interdict, should it not certainly override the Sabbath! R. Akiva rejoined: Or turn it around [i.e., I can turn the argument around. (For it was axiomatic to R. Akiva that haza'ah kept one back from the Pesach offering, so that it could be reasoned a fortiori that slaughtering should also keep him back)], viz.: Now if haza'ah, which is (only) a shvuth interdict, does not override the Sabbath, slaughtering, which is an (absolute) labor — how much more so should it not override the Sabbath! R. Eliezer rejoined: Akiva, you have uprooted what is written in the Torah, viz. (Numbers 9:3): \"towards evening, in its appointed time\" [(Ibid. 2)): \"Let the children of Israel offer the Pesach in its appointed time\"], whether on a weekday or on the Sabbath. R. Akiva answered: My master, bring me \"an appointed time\" for these (\"enablers\")! [i.e., Show me that they have an appointed time as slaughtering does. Therefore, since they have no appointed time, and they could have been performed the day before, they do not override. (And haza'ah, too, is not a function of the Pesach offering itself, and \"an appointed time\" is not written in respect to it.) The halachah is in accordance with R. Akiva.] R. Akiva stated a rule: Any labor which could have been done Sabbath eve does not override the Sabbath. Slaughtering (of the Pesach), which could not have been done Sabbath eve, overrides the Sabbath.",

And on the Sabbath, with a large amount [i.e., when the company is so small that the Pesach alone suffices for them], and in uncleanliness, a chagigah is not brought with it.",

For this is not \"erring in a matter of mitzvah,\" all knowing that these (i.e., such animals) are not kasher as a Pesach.] And if they are fit, [as when he slaughtered a one-year-old shelamim (peace-offering) lamb as a Pesach, erring in this because of his preoccupation with the slaughtering of his Pesach, and not remembering that he had dedicated it as a different sacrifice], R. Eliezer says that he is liable (for a sin-offering) [even though he has \"erred in a matter of mitzvah\"]; and R. Yehoshua says that he is not liable, [holding that if one erred in a matter of mitzvah and yet performed some mitzvah, he is not liable for a sin-offering. And this one performed a mitzvah, for he sacrificed an offering. For all offerings sacrificed lo lishman are kasher. And R. Yehoshua rules (Pesachim 62b) that even those which are slaughtered as a Pesach are kasher.] R. Eliezer said to him: Now if the Pesach, which it is permitted [to slaughter on Shabbath] lishmo, if he changes its name, [you nevertheless admit] that he is liable [for a sin-offering, as we learned above] — (other) sacrifices, which are forbidden (on Shabbath) lishman, if he changes their name, should it not follow, all the more, that he is liable! R. Yehoshua rejoined: No, in the instance of the Pesach, he changed the name to something which is forbidden [i.e., he slaughtered it in the name of a different offering, which it is forbidden to slaughter on Shabbath], whereas in the instance of the other sacrifices, where he changed the name to something which is permitted, [i.e., where he slaughtered it as something (a Pesach) which it is permitted to slaughter on Shabbath], (say that he is not liable for an offering)!

Eliezer rejoined: (Offerings) specified for the congregation [on Shabbath, such as temidim and mussafim overturn your argument], it being permitted to slaughter them lishman, and yet if one slaughters [other sacrifices] in their name (i.e., as communal offerings), he is liable (for a sin-offering)! R. Yehoshua rejoined: No, in the instance of offerings specified for the congregation there is a set number [He does not see others involved in slaughtering, and once the tamid has been slaughtered, he knows that there is no need to slaughter another, so that (if he does) he is not \"erring\" but \"unwitting,\" for he should not err in such a thing.], whereas in the instance of Pesach, there is no set amount, [for everyone requires it. So that he sees many people busied with it and he becomes preoccupied with the mitzvah. And even if he had already slaughtered a Pesach and found this animal standing in the azarah and thought it was a Pesach and slaughtered it for someone else, this is \"erring in a matter of mitzvah\"] (and he should not be liable for a sin-offering). R. Meir says: Also one who slaughters [on Shabbath other offerings, all the days of the year] as an offering specified for the congregation, is not liable. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehoshua and it is not in accordance with R. Meir.]",

If he slaughtered it and he discovered it to be blemished, he is liable (for a sin-offering) [for he is shogeg (\"unwitting\") and not anuss (\"constrained\"), for he should have inspected it (before he slaughtered it).] If he slaughtered it and found it to be treifah in a hidden part (which he could not have inspected beforehand), he is not liable. If he slaughtered it and found out that the owners had \"withdrawn their hands\" [from it before it was slaughtered and had numbered themselves with a different offering], or if they had died or become unclean, [in which instance Shabbath is not overridden for them], he is not liable, having slaughtered with permission [i.e., He is regarded as \"anuss,\" not having known that this was the case and not having been expected to inquire about it.]"

And in respect to communal offerings it is written (Numbers 29:39): \"These shall you offer unto the L rd in your appointed times,\" just as it is written in respect to the Pesach, \"in its appointed time.\" Our Mishnah apprises us that even though they are sacrificed in uncleanliness to satisfy the communal requirement, they are not eaten in uncleanliness. The reason we have \"Five things\" and not \"Communal offerings\" is to exclude all of the festival offerings, which are like communal offerings in that they come \"in a crowd,\" in a gathering of fellows for the festival; yet they do not override uncleanliness, just as they do not override the Sabbath.] (The five things:) the omer, the two breads, the show-bread, the congregational peace-offerings [the atzereth (Shavuoth) lambs, there being no other congregational peace-offerings], and the Rosh Chodesh goats.

And it is not slaughtered for the sick and the old by themselves lest their illness become aggravated and they not be able to eat an olive-size.] Therefore, [since when it was slaughtered for them they were fit, and the blood was sprinkled for them], if they became unfit [as explained above], they do not have a Pesach sheni obligation — except for the one who dug out a mound, [under which a dead man was found, in which instance he does have a Pesach sheni obligation], for he was unclean from the beginning [i.e., before it was slaughtered; for he \"tented over the uncleanliness from the time he began digging. This, if the mound were round, in which instance he definitely \"tented\" over it from the beginning; but if it were straight, it may be that at the time of slaughtering he had not yet tented over the uncleanliness, in which instance he has no Pesach sheni obligation.]", 
            "\tA Pesach is not slaughtered for an individual, [it being written (Deuteronomy 16:5): \"You may not sacrifice the Pesach b'achad…\", i.e., \"beyachid\" (\"for an individual\")]. These are the words of R. Yehudah. R. Yossi permits it. The Pesach is not slaughtered even for a company of a hundred who cannot eat an olive-size. [R. Yossi says this. That is, the criterion is eating (and not number). If one individual can eat an olive-size, a Pesach is slaughtered for him. If there are a hundred, none of whom can et an olive-size, the Pesach is not slaughtered for them. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.] A company is not made of women, bondsmen, and minors [to slaughter the Pesach. Women and bondsmen in one company — for fear of sexual license. Minors and bondsmen in one company — for fear of promiscuity, i.e., homosexuality. But women and bondsmen may form companies by themselves.]", 
            "\tAn onan immerses and eats his Pesach at night, [Torah aninuth (mourning) obtaining only in the daytime, viz. (Leviticus 10:19): \"…and if I had eaten a sin-offering this day, etc.\" — the day is forbidden; the night is permitted. And he requires immersion: Because kodshim had been forbidden to him until now, the rabbis required that he immerse. But an onan may not eat other kodshim (aside from Pesach) at night, for night-aninuth is forbidden (in kodshim) by rabbinic ordinance. But vis-à-vis Pesach, the rabbis did not establish their words in the face of kareth.], but not (other) kodshim, [for the eating of other kodshim is only an aseh (a positive commandment), viz. (Exodus 29:33): \"And they shall eat those things with which atonement was made.\"] If one hears about his dead one (i.e., that one of his close kin has died), [(On the day of his hearing, he is an onan derabanan)], and, [likewise], if one gathers the bones [of his father or mother (— it is stated in Moed Katan that he mourns them the entire day and does not mourn them at night)], he immerses and eats kodshim at night, [for in the daytime itself, he is only an onan derabanan]. If one becomes a proselyte on Pesach eve, Beth Shammai say: He immerses and eats his Pesach at night. Beth Hillel say: One who separates from the foreskin is as one who separates from the grave, [and he requires sprinkling on the third and seventh days. Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel differ only in respect to an uncircumcised gentile, who circumcised himself on the fourteenth (of Nissan), Beth Hillel holding — a decree, lest he become unclean the next year and say: \"Last year I was not cleaned of all my uncleanliness until the day of Pesach eve, when I immersed and ate — now, too, I will immerse and eat\" — not realizing that the preceding year, having been a gentile, he had not acquired uncleanliness, and that now, being a Jew, he does acquire uncleanliness. And Beth Shammai hold that we do not decree thus. But in respect to an uncircumcised Jew (as when his brothers died because of circumcision), all agree that he immerses and eats his Pesach at night, and we do not decree \"an uncircumcised Jew by reason of an uncircumcised gentile.\"]"

Akiva said: I will explain it: The Pesach [which was lost and another substituted for it, and] which was found before the slaughtering of the [second] Pesach, [so that it (the first) was standing before us at the time of the slaughtering — the time of slaughtering designated it as a \"Pesach,\" so that its not having been sacrificed renders it \"actively rejected,\" for which reason it itself is not sacrificed as a shelamim] (but it) is allowed to graze until it sustains a blemish and it is sold. And the same is true of its substitute [if he afterwards substituted a non-dedicated (chullin) animal for it.] After the slaughtering of the Pesach, it is sacrificed as a shelamim [i.e., If after the slaughtering of the second the first were found, the time of slaughtering had not designated it (the first) as a Pesach, and it was not \"actively rejected,\" so that it itself is sacrificed as a shelamim]. And the same is true of its substitute. [And R. Yehoshua could have spoken of the Pesach itself, viz.: \"There is a Pesach which is sacrificed and a Pesach which is not sacrificed.\"]",

And if they sustained blemishes after the festival, he offers them as shelamim, for the choicest might have been a Pesach. And that addition which he must add for the second until he arrives at the amount of the choicest, he lays out from his pocket. For example, if the choicest were worth a sela, he brings three of his selaim, and, taking one, says: \"Wherever the burnt-offering is, it is exchanged for this sela,\" and he brings a burnt-offering for it. Then he takes the second sela and says: \"Wherever the guilt-offering is, it is exchanged for this sela,\" and he brings a guilt-offering for it; and so, with the shelamim.] If the Pesach got mixed up with bechoroth (firstlings)], for which the sprinkling of the blood is the same as for the Pesach], R.

And he sacrifices the Pesach as a Pesach wherever it is, and the bechoroth as bechoroth wherever they are. And even though he thereby diminishes the time in which the bechor is eaten (for a bechor is normally eaten for two days and one night, and now it can only be eaten until mid-night, the cut-off time for the Pesach, so that he is found to be bringing consecrated food to \"the house of psul\" - unfitness), R. Shimon holds that he is permitted to do so.

And if they might have been exchanged, and they wish to withdraw from their Pesach and be numbered on the other, when they say: \"We withdraw from ours\" they are leaving the Pesach without owners, and this is forbidden.] But now, when an individual from one company comes to the other, whatever the case, there is no Pesach without owners. For if they chose theirs, correctly, all the members of their company are numbered for it, except this individual, who withdrew from his company (and is now joining theirs).
