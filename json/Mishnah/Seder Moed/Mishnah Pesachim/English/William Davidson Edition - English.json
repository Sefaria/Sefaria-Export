            "<b>On the evening [<i>or</i>] of the fourteenth</b> of the month of Nisan, <b>one searches for leavened bread</b> in his home <b>by candlelight. Any place into which one does not</b> typically <b>take leavened bread does not require a search,</b> as it is unlikely that there is any leavened bread there. <b>And with regard to what</b> the Sages of previous generations meant when they <b>said</b> that one must search <b>two rows</b> of wine barrels <b>in a cellar,</b> i.e., <b>a place into which one</b> typically <b>takes</b> some <b>leavened bread,</b> the early <i>tanna’im</i> are in dispute. <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that this is referring to searching the first <b>two rows across the entire cellar, and Beit Hillel say:</b> There is no need to search that extensively, as it is sufficient to search <b>the two external rows, which are the upper ones.</b> This dispute will be explained and illustrated in the Gemara.",
            "After conducting the search, <b>one</b> need <b>not</b> be <b>concerned that perhaps a marten dragged</b> leaven <b>from house to house, or from place to place,</b> placing leaven in a house that was already searched. <b>As if so,</b> one need also be concerned that perhaps leaven might have been dragged <b>from courtyard to courtyard and from city to city.</b> In that case, <b>there is no end to the matter,</b> and it would be impossible to rely on any search for leaven.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One searches</b> for leaven <b>on the evening of the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>and on the fourteenth</b> in <b>the morning, and at the time of</b> the <b>removal</b> of leaven. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> that is not the case; however, if <b>one did not search on the evening of the fourteenth he</b> should <b>search on the fourteenth</b> during the day. If <b>he did not search on the fourteenth, he should search during the festival</b> of Passover. If <b>he did not search during the Festival, he should search after the Festival,</b> as any leaven that remained in his possession during the Festival is classified as leaven owned by a Jew during Passover, which one is obligated to remove. <b>And</b> the principle is: With regard to the leaven <b>that</b> one <b>leaves</b> after the search, he should <b>place it in</b> a <b>concealed</b> location where it will most likely be left untouched, <b>so that it will not require searching after it</b> if it goes missing.",
            "The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree regarding until what time leaven may be eaten and at what time it must be removed on Passover eve. <b>Rabbi Meir says: One</b> may <b>eat</b> leaven <b>the entire fifth</b> hour of the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>and one</b> must <b>burn</b> it immediately afterward <b>at the beginning of the sixth</b> hour. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One</b> may <b>eat the entire fourth</b> hour <b>and</b> one <b>places it in abeyance</b> for <b>the entire fifth</b> hour, <b>and one burns</b> it <b>at the beginning of the sixth</b> hour.",
            "<b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: Two disqualified loaves of a thanks-offering are placed on the bench</b> in the colonnade in the Temple as an indicator. There was a specially designated place for these loaves in the Temple. <b>As long as</b> the loaves <b>are placed</b> there, <b>the entire nation</b> continues to <b>eat</b> leaven. When <b>one</b> of the loaves <b>was taken</b> away, the people know that the time had come <b>to place</b> the leaven <b>in abeyance,</b> meaning that they <b>neither eat nor burn</b> their leaven. When <b>they were both taken</b> away, <b>the entire nation began burning</b> their leaven. <b>Rabban Gamliel says</b> that the times are divided differently: <b>Non-sacred</b> foods <b>are eaten the entire fourth</b> hour, <b>and <i>teruma</i></b> may be eaten during <b>the entire fifth</b> hour. Since it is a mitzva to eat <i>teruma</i> and burning it is prohibited, additional time was allocated for its consumption. <b>And one burns</b> all leaven including <i>teruma</i> <b>at the beginning of the sixth</b> hour.",
            "Apropos the removal of leaven on Passover eve, including the consecrated loaves of thanks-offerings and <i>teruma</i>, the mishna cites a related <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina the deputy High Priest says: In</b> all <b>the days of the priests, they did not refrain from burning meat that became ritually impure by</b> coming into contact with <b>a secondary source of ritual impurity,</b> i.e., an object that had come into contact with a primary source of impurity, together <b>with meat that became ritually impure by</b> contact with <b>a primary source of impurity.</b> They would do so <b>even though they</b> would thereby <b>add</b> a degree of <b>impurity to</b> the <b>impurity</b> of the first piece of meat, which was previously impure to a lesser degree. <b>Rabbi Akiva added</b> to the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina the deputy High Priest <b>and said: In</b> all <b>the days of the priests, they did not refrain from lighting</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>oil that was</b> ritually <b>disqualified by</b> coming into contact with <b>one who immersed himself during that day</b> and who does not become completely purified until nightfall <b>in a lamp that became ritually impure</b> with first-degree impurity <b>through</b> contact with one who became <b>ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse.</b> They did so <b>even though they</b> would thereby <b>add impurity to</b> the <b>impurity</b> of the oil. A person who immersed himself during that day assumes the status of second-degree ritual impurity. His contact renders the oil ritually impure with third-degree ritual impurity. The lamp with first-degree ritual impurity renders the oil ritually impure with second-degree impurity.",
            "<b>Rabbi Meir said: From their statements we learned that one</b> may <b>burn ritually pure <i>teruma</i> with impure</b> <i>teruma</i> when removing leaven <b>on Passover</b> eve. The rationale that applies to the two previous cases applies here as well. Since both items are being burned, one may disregard the fact that one item will assume a higher degree of ritual impurity in the process. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: That is not the inference</b> from which the <i>halakha</i> in the case of ritually pure and ritually impure <i>teruma</i> can be learned. In those first two cases, the two items are both ritually impure, albeit at different degrees of ritual impurity. Rabbi Meir is referring to the combination of impure <i>teruma</i> with pure <i>teruma</i>, which would render pure <i>teruma</i> ritually impure. <b>And</b> in fact <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who disagree with regard to the burning of leavened <i>teruma</i>, nevertheless <b>concede that one burns this</b> ritually pure <i>teruma</i> <b>by itself and that</b> impure <i>teruma</i> <b>by itself. With regard to what did they disagree?</b> They disagreed <b>with regard to</b> whether one may burn <i>teruma</i> <b>in abeyance,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> whose purity is uncertain, <b>and</b> definitely <b>impure</b> <i>teruma</i> together, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer says: This</b> <i>teruma</i> in abeyance <b>should be burned by itself, and that</b> impure <i>teruma</i> <b>should be burned by itself; and Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> In that case, <b>both of them</b> may be burned <b>as one.</b>"

            "For the <b>entire time that it is permitted to eat</b> leavened bread, <b>one</b> may also <b>feed</b> it <b>to</b> his <b>domesticated animals, to non-domesticated animals, and to birds; and one</b> may <b>sell</b> it <b>to a gentile; and it is permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit from it.</b> After <b>its time passes, it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit from it, and one may not</b> even <b>light an oven or a stove with</b> leavened bread. With regard to the manner of removal of leavened bread, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The removal of leavened bread is</b> to be accomplished <b>only</b> through <b>burning. And the Rabbis say:</b> Burning is not required, as <b>one</b> may <b>even crumble</b> it <b>and throw</b> it <b>into the wind or cast</b> it <b>into the sea.</b>",
            "<b>It is permitted</b> for a Jew <b>to</b> derive <b>benefit from leavened bread of a gentile over which Passover has elapsed,</b> i.e., leavened bread that remains after the conclusion of Passover. However, <b>it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit from</b> leaven <b>of a Jew</b> over which Passover has elapsed, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And no leavened bread shall be seen with you, <b>neither shall there be leaven seen with you,</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7).",
            "If <b>a gentile lent money to a Jew,</b> and the Jew gave him <b>leavened bread as</b> collateral until after Passover, and <b>after Passover</b> the gentile retains this leavened bread in lieu of payment, then <b>one is permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit from</b> this leavened bread. Since the leavened bread was retained by the gentile based on the transfer that took place prior to Passover, the leavened bread is considered to have belonged to the gentile during Passover. Whereas if <b>a Jew lent money to a gentile,</b> and <b>leavened bread</b> was given as collateral during Passover in the same manner as in the previous case, then <b>after Passover it is forbidden to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from this leavened bread. Since this leavened bread was considered to be in the Jew’s property during Passover, it is forbidden to derive benefit from it afterward. <b>Leavened bread upon which a rockslide has fallen is considered as though it has been eliminated,</b> and it is not necessary to dig it up in order to burn it. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Any</b> leavened bread that has been covered to such an extent <b>that a dog cannot search after it</b> is considered to have been eliminated.",
            "<b>If one unwittingly eats <i>teruma</i> of leavened bread on Passover,</b> not realizing that the food was <i>teruma</i>, then <b>he must pay the principal and an</b> additional <b>fifth.</b> This is because one who unwittingly eats <i>teruma</i> must compensate the priest for the value of the <i>teruma</i> and add a fifth of the value, even though the <i>teruma</i> is considered to be valueless on Passover. If he <b>intentionally</b> ate the <i>teruma</i> then <b>he is exempt from payment;</b> as he is liable to receive the severe punishment of <i>karet</i>, he is therefore exempt from the lesser punishment of payment. If he ate impure <i>teruma</i> in this manner then he is not even required to pay <b>its monetary</b> value <b>in wood,</b> for one who derives benefit from impure <i>teruma</i> calculates its value by treating it as though it were fuel for burning. While impure <i>teruma</i> can be used in this manner during the rest of the year, one may not derive any benefit from leavened bread on Passover, and therefore such <i>teruma</i> is worthless.",
            "<b>These are</b> the types of grain <b>with which a person fulfills his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on the</b> first night of <b>Passover: With wheat, with barley, with spelt [<i>kusmin</i>], with rye [<i>shifon</i>], and with oats [<i>shibbolet shu’al</i>].

The mishna continues: <b>One</b> may <b>not boil the Paschal</b> lamb <b>in</b> ordinary <b>liquids or in fruit juices,</b> as the Torah explicitly states that it must be roasted. <b>However,</b> one may <b>baste</b> it while it is roasting <b>and dip it into</b> liquid while eating it.

            "<b>How does one separate <i>ḥalla</i> in ritual impurity during the Festival</b> day of Passover? Ordinarily, one may separate ritually pure <i>ḥalla</i> from dough and give it to a priest immediately so that he may eat it. Ritually impure <i>ḥalla</i> is unfit for a priest and must be burned, yet it is prohibited to bake or burn anything that is not fit to be eaten during the Festival day.

            "<b>These</b> are the <b>matters</b> related to the <b>Paschal lamb</b> that <b>override Shabbat,</b> when the eve of Passover occurs on Shabbat: <b>Its slaughter, the sprinkling of its blood, the cleaning of its intestines and the burning of its fats</b> on the altar, all of which are services that must be performed on Passover eve while it is still day. <b>However, its roasting and the washing of its intestines,</b> which need not be done by day, <b>do not override Shabbat;</b> rather, one waits until after Shabbat to perform these tasks. <b>Carrying</b> the Paschal lamb through a public domain does not override Shabbat. The Paschal offering consisted of either a lamb or a goat, sometimes quite young and unable to walk the entire way, so that it had to be carried on a person’s shoulders. Similarly, <b>bringing it from outside the Shabbat limit and cutting off its wart do not override Shabbat,</b> as all these tasks could have been performed before Shabbat. A wart is considered a blemish that disqualifies the animal from being brought as an offering, but once the wart is removed, the animal is fit to be sacrificed on the altar. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> All of these procedures <b>override</b> Shabbat.",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> Could this <b>not</b> be derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference? If slaughter, which is</b> ordinarily forbidden on Shabbat <b>as a</b> biblically prohibited <b>labor,</b> nonetheless <b>overrides Shabbat</b> when performed for the sake of the Paschal lamb, then <b>these</b> activities, namely carrying the animal, bringing it from outside the Shabbat limit, and the like, which are prohibited <b>due to rabbinic decree, should they not override Shabbat? Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b> The law governing <b>a Festival proves</b> otherwise, for the Torah <b>permitted on it</b> acts that are normally prohibited <b>as labor,</b> such as slaughtering, cooking, and baking, <b>and</b> yet <b>it is forbidden</b> to do <b>on it</b> acts that are prohibited <b>due to rabbinic decree.</b> Thus, we cannot derive policy with regard to rabbinic prohibitions from the rules that govern Torah laws. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: What is this, Yehoshua?</b> How can you suggest such a weak proof? <b>What proof</b> can be deduced from <b>optional</b> activities that would apply <b>to a mitzva?</b> How does the fact that rabbinic decrees remain in effect on a Festival with respect to optional activities prove that one is also forbidden to transgress a rabbinic decree in order to fulfill the mitzva of offering the Paschal lamb? <b>Rabbi Akiva responded and said</b> in defense of Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion: <b>Sprinkling</b> the purifying water of a red heifer upon someone who had contracted ritual impurity through contact with a corpse <b>proves</b> the matter, <b>for it is</b> done <b>for</b> the sake of <b>a mitzva,</b> in order to allow the person to offer the Paschal lamb, <b>and it is</b> prohibited only <b>due to rabbinic decree, and</b> nonetheless <b>it does not override Shabbat,</b> for the purification rite is not performed on the eve of Passover that falls on Shabbat. <b>So, too, you should not be surprised about these</b> activities, namely carrying the animal, bringing it from outside the Shabbat limit, and cutting off its wart, <b>that although they are</b> performed <b>for</b> the sake of <b>a mitzva and they are</b> prohibited only <b>due to rabbinic decree, they do not override Shabbat.</b> <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him:</b> I do not accept this proof. <b>With regard to this</b> sprinkling itself, <b>I infer</b> that it, too, is permitted for the same reason: <b>If slaughter, which is</b> a biblically prohibited <b>labor, overrides Shabbat, is it not right that sprinkling</b> the purifying water of a red heifer, <b>which is</b> prohibited only <b>due to rabbinic decree, should override Shabbat?</b> You cannot challenge me based on a premise with which I disagree. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>Or</b> perhaps we can <b>reverse</b> the order of your argument and say the opposite: <b>If,</b> as we know by accepted tradition, <b>sprinkling</b> the purifying water on Shabbat, <b>which is</b> prohibited only <b>due to rabbinic decree, does not override Shabbat,</b> then with regard to <b>slaughter, which is</b> prohibited <b>as a</b> biblically prohibited <b>labor, is it not right that it should not override Shabbat?</b> Therefore, it should be prohibited to slaughter the Paschal lamb when the eve of Passover occurs on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Akiva,</b> how can you say this? <b>You have</b> thus <b>uprooted what is written in the Torah:</b> “Let the children of Israel offer the Paschal lamb <b>in its appointed time”</b> (Numbers 9:2); the phrase “at its appointed time” indicates that the offering must be brought on that day, <b>whether it is a weekday or Shabbat.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>My teacher, bring me an appointed time</b> stated in the Torah <b>for these</b> tasks, namely, carrying the animal or bringing it from outside the Shabbat limits, <b>like the appointed time</b> stated <b>with respect to slaughter.</b> The Paschal lamb must be slaughtered on the fourteenth of Nisan, but there is no fixed time when the animal must be brought to the Temple, and it is therefore possible to transport it before Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Akiva stated a principle: Any prohibited labor</b> required for the offering of the sacrifice <b>that can be performed on the eve of Shabbat does not override Shabbat; slaughter, which cannot be performed on the eve of Shabbat, overrides Shabbat.</b>",
            "<b>When does one bring a Festival peace-offering with</b> the Paschal lamb? A special offering is brought on the fourteenth of Nisan together with the Paschal lamb <b>when</b> the Paschal lamb <b>comes on a weekday</b> rather than on Shabbat, and when it comes <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity</b> as opposed to when it is brought in a state of impurity because most of the community is impure, <b>and</b> when many people are registered for the Paschal lamb so that each person will receive only <b>a small</b> portion from it. When these three conditions are met, the Festival peace-offering is eaten first and the Paschal lamb is eaten afterward. <b>When,</b> however, the Paschal lamb <b>comes on Shabbat,</b> or <b>when</b> few people are registered for it so that each person will receive <b>a large</b> portion, or when it is brought <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity, one does not bring a Festival peace-offering with it.</b>",
            "With regard to the extra offering itself, the <b>Festival peace-offering would come from the flock, from the herd, from sheep or from goats, from males or from females,</b> as the Festival peace-offering is not bound by the limitations governing the Paschal offering, which must be specifically a young male sheep or goat. <b>And</b> the Festival peace-offering <b>is eaten for two days and one night</b> like other peace-offerings.",
            "<b>A Paschal lamb that one slaughtered for a different purpose on Shabbat,</b> not knowing that it is prohibited for him to do so, is disqualified, and <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering for it</b> because he unwittingly performed a prohibited labor on Shabbat. As for <b>all other offerings,</b> such as a peace-offering, <b>that one</b> unwittingly <b>slaughtered</b> on Shabbat <b>for the purpose of a Paschal offering, if they were not fit</b> for the Paschal offering, e.g., if they were female or cattle or more than a year old and clearly ineligible for the Paschal offering, <b>he is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering. Because he did not fulfill the mitzva to bring a Paschal offering, his act of slaughter was therefore unnecessary. <b>And if they were fit, Rabbi Eliezer</b> nevertheless <b>deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering</b> for his unwitting transgression. <b>But Rabbi Yehoshua exempts</b> him, because he maintains that if someone intended to perform a mitzva, and despite his error he in fact performed a mitzva, he is not liable to bring a sin-offering. And in this case he performed a mitzva, because offerings that are sacrificed for a different purpose are still fit. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>If,</b> with regard to <b>the Paschal lamb, which is permitted</b> to be slaughtered on Shabbat <b>for its own purpose, when one changed its purpose he is</b> nevertheless <b>liable,</b> then, with regard to other <b>offerings that are forbidden</b> to be slaughtered on Shabbat even <b>for their own purpose, when one changed their purpose, is it not right that he should be liable? Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: No,</b> this reasoning is faulty. <b>If you say</b> that one is liable to bring a sin-offering if he slaughtered <b>a Paschal lamb</b> for a different purpose, it is <b>because he changed</b> its purpose <b>for something forbidden,</b> as the offering he intended it to be may not be slaughtered on Shabbat. But <b>can you</b> necessarily <b>say</b> the same thing <b>about</b> other <b>offerings that he</b> slaughtered for the purpose of a Paschal offering and thus <b>changed</b> their purpose <b>for something</b> that is <b>permitted</b> to be sacrificed on Shabbat? <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Let the communal offerings,</b> such as the daily offering and the additional-offerings of Shabbat and the Festivals, <b>prove</b> the matter, <b>for they are permitted</b> to be slaughtered on Shabbat <b>for their own purpose, and</b> nevertheless, <b>one who</b> unnecessarily <b>slaughters</b> a different offering <b>for their purpose is liable.</b>This indicates that even when a particular offering may be slaughtered, one is nevertheless liable if he slaughtered a different offering for the purpose of the permitted offering. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: No, if you say</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>communal offerings,</b> it is <b>because they have a limit,</b> as there is a specific number of communal offerings that must be offered on any particular day and there is no reason one would mistakenly sacrifice extra offerings for this purpose. But <b>can you</b> necessarily <b>say</b> the same thing <b>about the Paschal lamb, which does not have a limit,</b> making it more likely for someone to make a mistake? <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> According to Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>even one who</b> unwittingly <b>slaughters</b> other offerings <b>for the purpose of communal offerings</b> beyond their daily limit <b>is exempt</b> for the same reason, i.e., that he intended to fulfill a mitzva that is permitted on Shabbat.",
            "The mishna continues with another <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal lamb: <b>If one slaughtered</b> a Paschal lamb on Shabbat and mistakenly intended it <b>for those who cannot eat it,</b> such as sick or elderly people who are unable to eat the meat, <b>or for those who did not register for it,</b> or <b>for</b> the sake of <b>the uncircumcised or for those ritually impure,</b> the offering is disqualified and <b>he is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for his unnecessary act of slaughter.

If <b>he slaughtered it and it was found to have a blemish,</b> the offering is disqualified, and <b>he is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for having unwittingly performed a prohibited labor on Shabbat, as he should have examined the animal before it was slaughtered. If <b>he slaughtered it and it was found to have a hidden condition that would cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> and that could not have been discovered before the slaughter even if it were examined properly, the offering is disqualified, but <b>he is exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering. This is not a case of <i>shogeg</i>, unwitting violation of Shabbat, but rather of <i>ones</i>, an unavoidable accident.

If <b>he did not say</b> anything <b>to them and they did not say</b> anything <b>to him,</b> meaning that neither side granted the other authority to slaughter a Paschal lamb on its behalf, <b>they are not responsible for each other,</b> and the members of the group eat their Paschal lamb while the individual sent to find the lost animal eats from his own offering. The reason for this is that the individual is registered only for the original offering, while the other members of the group withdrew from that lost offering by sacrificing a different Paschal lamb.",
            "<b>Two groups whose Paschal lambs have become intermingled</b> and they do not know which one belongs to which group should act in the following manner: <b>These</b> members of the first group <b>draw one</b> of the animals separated as a Paschal lamb <b>for themselves, and those</b> members of the second group <b>draw one for themselves. One of these,</b> a member of one group, <b>comes to those,</b> the members of the other group, <b>and one of those</b> members of the second group <b>comes to these</b> members of the first group. <b>And this is what</b> each group <b>says</b> to the member of the other group who has come to join them: <b>If this Paschal lamb</b> that is now in our possession <b>is ours, you are withdrawn from</b> the Paschal lamb that was <b>yours, and you are registered for our</b> Paschal lamb and you may eat from it. <b>And if this Paschal lamb is yours,</b> meaning that it actually belongs to the other group, including this individual, <b>we are</b> hereby <b>withdrawn from ours and we are registered for your</b> Paschal lamb, which you agree to share with us. The other group makes the same statement. <b>And similarly,</b> if there were <b>five groups of five</b> people <b>each</b> or <b>of ten</b> people <b>each, they draw one</b> person <b>from each and every group, and they say this</b> statement mentioned in the case of two groups. The remaining member or members of each group will grant the representatives of the other groups that have come to join them a share in the Paschal lamb, and they will acquire a share in it for themselves in case the animal they have chosen belonged originally to one of the other groups.",
            "In the case of <b>two</b> individuals <b>whose Paschal lambs became intermingled</b> and each person was the only one registered for his offering, what should they do? <b>This</b> person <b>draws one</b> of the Paschal lambs <b>for himself and that</b> person <b>draws one for himself; this</b> person <b>registers someone from the marketplace with him</b> on his Paschal lamb <b>and that</b> person <b>registers someone from the marketplace with him</b> on his Paschal lamb. Once this has been done, <b>this one comes to that</b> person from the marketplace who has been added to the other person’s sacrifice, <b>and that one comes to this</b> person from the marketplace who has been added to the first person’s sacrifice, <b>and this is what they say: If this Paschal lamb is mine, you are withdrawn from yours and you are registered for mine, and if this is your Paschal lamb, I am withdrawn from mine and I am</b> hereby <b>registered for yours,</b> as described previously. The reason it is necessary for each individual to add an additional person to his Paschal lamb, is to ensure that when each person withdraws from his original Paschal lamb and registers for the other, no Paschal lamb will be left ownerless for any amount of time."

            "The <i>tanna</i> describes the beginning of the Passover seder.

The <i>tanna</i> comments that this was the practice, <b>although</b> eating <b><i>ḥaroset</i> is not a mitzva</b> but merely a custom. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Tzadok says:</b> Actually, it is <b>a mitzva</b> to eat <i>ḥaroset</i>. <b>And in</b> the period when <b>the Temple</b> stood and they offered the Paschal lamb, <b>they brought before him the body of the Paschal lamb.</b>",
            "The attendants <b>poured the second cup for</b> the leader of the seder, <b>and here the son asks his father</b> the questions about the differences between Passover night and a regular night. <b>And if the son does not have the intelligence</b> to ask questions on his own, <b>his father teaches him</b> the questions.

            "<b>Rabban Gamliel would say: Anyone who did not say</b> <b>these three matters on Passover has not fulfilled his obligation:</b> The <b>Paschal lamb, <i>matza</i>, and bitter herbs.</b> When one mentions these matters, he must elaborate and explain them: The <b>Paschal lamb</b> is brought <b>because the Omnipresent passed over [<i>pasaḥ</i>] the houses of our forefathers in Egypt, as it is stated: “That you shall say: It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Paschal offering for He passed over</b> the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses” (Exodus 12:27). Rabban Gamliel continues to explain: The reason for <b><i>matza</i></b> is <b>because our forefathers were redeemed from Egypt, as it is stated: “And they baked the dough that they took out of Egypt</b> as cakes of <i>matzot</i>, for it was not leavened, as they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual” (Exodus 12:39). The reason for <b>bitter herbs</b> is <b>because the Egyptians embittered our forefathers’ lives in Egypt, as it is stated: “And they embittered their lives</b> with hard service, in mortar and in brick; in all manner of service in the field, all the service that they made them serve was with rigor” (Exodus 1:14). The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna further states: <b>In each and every generation a person must view himself as though he</b> personally <b>left Egypt, as it is stated: “And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: It is because of this which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 13:8). In every generation, each person must say: “This which the Lord did for me,” and not: This which the Lord did for my forefathers. The mishna continues with the text of the Haggadah. <b>Therefore we are obligated to thank, praise, glorify, extol, exalt, honor, bless, revere, and laud [<i>lekales</i>] the One who performed for our forefathers and for us all these miracles: He took us out from slavery to freedom, from sorrow to joy, from mourning to a Festival, from darkness to a great light, and from enslavement to redemption. And we will say before Him: <i>Halleluya</i>.</b> At this point one recites the <i>hallel</i> that is said on all joyous days. Since one does not complete <i>hallel</i> at this point in the seder, the mishna asks: ",
            "<b>Until where does one recite</b> <i>hallel</i>? <b>Beit Shammai say: Until</b> “Who makes the barren woman dwell in her house as <b>a joyful mother of children,</b> <i>halleluya</i>” (Psalms 113:9). <b>And Beit Hillel say: Until</b> “Who turned the rock into a pool of water, <b>the flint into a fountain of waters”</b> (Psalms 114:8). <b>And one concludes</b> this section of <i>hallel</i> <b>with</b> a blessing that refers to <b>redemption. Rabbi Tarfon says</b> that although one should recite: <b>Who redeemed us and redeemed our forefathers from Egypt,</b> one who did so <b>would not conclude</b> with the formula: Blessed are You, Lord. <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that one recites a different version of this blessing: <b>So too, the Lord our God and the God of our forefathers will bring us to future holidays and Festivals in peace, happy over the building of Your city and joyous in Your service. And there we will eat from the Paschal lamb and other offerings, etc., until: Blessed are You, Lord, Who redeemed Israel.</b> ",
            "<b>They poured for</b> the leader of the seder <b>the third cup</b> of wine, <b>and he recites the blessing over his food,</b> Grace After Meals. Next, they pour him the <b>fourth</b> cup. <b>He completes <i>hallel</i> over it,</b> as he already recited the first part of <i>hallel</i> before the meal. <b>And he</b> also <b>recites the blessing of the song</b> at the end of <i>hallel</i> <b>over</b> the fourth cup. During the period <b>between these cups,</b> i.e., the first three cups established by the Sages, <b>if one wishes to drink</b> more <b>he</b> may <b>drink;</b> however, <b>between the third</b> cup <b>and the fourth</b> cup one should <b>not drink.</b>",
            " <b>One does not conclude after the Paschal lamb with an <i>afikoman</i>.</b> <b>If some of</b> the participants at the seder <b>fell asleep,</b> thereby interrupting their meal, <b>they</b> may <b>eat</b> from the Paschal lamb when they awake. If the <b>entire</b> company fell asleep, <b>they</b> may <b>not eat</b> any more. If they all fall asleep, this is considered a complete interruption, and if they were to resume their meal it would be akin to eating the offering in two different places. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> If <b>they dozed they</b> may <b>eat</b> from the Paschal lamb when they awake, but if <b>they fell</b> fast <b>asleep they</b> may <b>not eat</b> from it.",
            "The Sages further said: <b>The Paschal lamb after midnight renders one’s hands ritually impure,</b> as it becomes <i>notar</i>, an offering that remained after the time when they may be eaten has expired; and the Sages ruled that both <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> offerings that were invalidated due to inappropriate intent while being sacrificed, <b>and <i>notar</i> render one’s hands ritually impure.</b> If <b>one recited the blessing over the Paschal lamb,</b> which is: Who sanctified us with His mitzvot and commanded us to eat the Paschal lamb, <b>he has</b> also <b>exempted</b> himself from reciting a blessing over the Festival <b>offering.</b> The blessing for the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth of Nisan is: Who sanctified us with His mitzvot and commanded us to eat the offering. However, if <b>he recited the blessing over the</b> Festival <b>offering, he has not exempted</b> himself from reciting a blessing over <b>the Paschal lamb.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: This</b> blessing <b>does not exempt</b> one from reciting a blessing over <b>this one, and that</b> blessing <b>does not exempt that one,</b> as there is a separate blessing for each offering."
