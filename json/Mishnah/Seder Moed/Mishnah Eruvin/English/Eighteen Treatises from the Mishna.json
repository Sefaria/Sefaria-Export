            "We [may] make <i>pasin</i> [L-shaped quasi-partitions which permit drawing water from wells in the public domain]  for wells [in order for the well and the area around it to be considered a single domain: the <i>pasin</i> must be made of] four double boards, [placed at the corners of the well so] that [they] appear like eight - so says Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says, \"Eight [boards must be used], which appear like twelve, [namely] four double boards and four single ones.\" Their height must be ten <i>tefachim</i> [a specific unit of length] and their width six [<i>tefachim</i>], and their thickness anything and [the gap] between them [must not be wider] than the width of two teams of cattle, each team consisting of three cattle - so says Rabbi  Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says, \"[Each team] of four.\" [The width is the space taken by cattle] yoked together and not unyoked, [in such a way that when] one [team] enters, [the other] one exits.",
            "It is permitted to move the [<i>pasin</i>] closer to the well, but only if the cow's head and the greater part of its body is within [them] as it drinks. It is permitted to move [the <i>pasin</i>] away from the well, but only if one adds more <i>pasin</i>.",
            "Rabbi Yehuda said, \"[The distance from the well, at which it is permitted to place the <i>pasin</i> is] up until <i>beit se'atayim</i> [a measure of area, equivalent to that area of land large enough to require a <i> se'atayim</i> of seeds to sow it].\" [The Sages] said to him, \"They didn't say <i>beit se'atayim</i> except concerning a garden or a <i>karpef</i> [an enclosed area outside of a town or village], but if [the area that was being enclosed] was a pen or a fold or a field [behind the house] or a yard [in front of the house], even if is five <i>beit kor</i> [the same as a <i>beit se'atayim</i> but for a <i> kor</i> of seeds], even if it is ten <i>beit kor</i>, it is permissible [to set up <i>pasin</i> around it]. It is permitted to distance [the <i>pasin</i>] any amount, but only if one adds more <i>pasin</i>.\"",
            "Rabbi Yehuda said, \"If a public thoroughfare intersects the <i>pasin</i>, one should move it to [one of] the sides.\" The sages say, \"It is not necessary.\" It is the same [if it is a] public cistern or a public well  or a private well, we [only need to] make <i>pasin</i> for them; but for a private cistern, we make a [full] <i>mechitza</i> [legal partition] of ten <i>tefachim</i> [a specific unit of length] - so says Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda ben Baba says, \"We can only make <i>pasin</i> for a public well, but for all others we [are required to] make a [full] partition ten <i>tefachim</i> high.\"",
            "Rabbi Yehuda ben Baba also said, \"If a garden or <i>karpef</i> be  seventy <i>amot</i> [specific unit of length] and a bit [long] by seventy <i>amot</i> and a bit  [wide and] is encircled by a fence ten <i>tefachim</i> high, we [may] move [carry things] within it, but only if there is a guardbooth or dwelling within it, or if it is close to the town.\" Rabbi Yehuda said, \"Even if there is nothing within it except a cistern or a ditch or a cave, we [may] move [carry things] within it.\" Rabbi Akiva says, \"Even if there is not [even] one of all these [items] within it, we [may] move [carry things] within it, but only if it [is no more than] seventy <i>amot</i> and a bit [long] by seventy <i>amot</i> and a bit  [wide].\" Rabbi Eliezer said, \"If its length exceeds its width by even a single <i>amah</i>, we do not move [carry things] within it [as it would be forbidden].\"  Rabbi Yose says, \"Even if its length is twice its width, we [may] move [carry things] within it.\"",
            "Rabbi Elai said, \"I heard from Rabbi Eliezer, 'Even [if a garden or a <i>karpef</i> is as large as] a <i>beit kor</i> [it is permitted to move things within it].' I also heard from him, 'If one of the householders of a courtyard had forgotten, and did not [participate in] the <i>eruv</i> [halachic merging of separate domains by means of setting aside an amount of food in a designated place], it is forbidden for him to carry any thing out of, or into, his house; but for them [the other residents of the courtyard] it is permitted  [to do so].' I also heard from him, 'We [may] fulfill our obligation [to eat bitter herbs] on Passover with spleenwort.'

If someone sends his <i>eruv</i> via the hand of a deaf-mute, a <i>shoteh</i>, a minor or one who does not acknowledge [the legal validity of] an <i>eruv</i>, it is not [considered] an <i>eruv</i>: but if he has told another person [not of the categories just mentioned] to receive it from [his messenger from those categories], behold it is [considered] an <i>eruv</i>.",

If he has put it into a pit, even if it is a hundred <i>amot</i> [a specific unit of length] deep, his <i>eruv</i> is [considered] an <i>eruv</i>.

If they carried him into another town, or put him into a pen or fold [for cattle], Rabban Gamaliel, and Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah say, \"He may walk [throughout] all of it.\" But Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva say, \"He only has  four <i>amot</i> within which to move.\" It once happened that they [these four sages] came from Perendisin, and their ship went out to sea [on Shabbat]: Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah walked [throughout] all of [the vessel]; but Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva did not move beyond four <i>amot</i>, since they wanted to be strict upon themselves.",

Rabbi Eliezer said, \"It happened in the synagogue in Tiberias that they were accustomed to [treat] it as permitted, until Rabban Gamliel and the elders came and forbade [it] to them.\" Rabbi Yose said, \"[On the contrary;] as forbidden they were accustomed to [treat] it , until Rabban Gamliel and the elders came and permitted [it] to them.\"",
            "If there is a loose bolt that [is fastened to a rope and part of it] drags [on the ground], we may [use it to] lock [a door] in the Temple, but not in the [rest of the] country; but a bolt that rests [completely on the floor] is forbidden in either place. Rabbi Yehuda says, \"[Even] one that rests is permitted in the Temple, and one that drags [is permitted also] in the [rest of the] country.\"",
            "We may refasten the lower hinge [of a door] in the Temple, but not in the [rest of the] country; but [to refasten] the upper [hinge] is forbidden in either place. Rabbi Yehuda says, \"[Even] the upper one [may be refastened] in the Temple, and the lower one [also] in [the rest of the] country.\"",
            "We may refashion a bandage [dressing] in the Temple, but not  in the [rest of the] country. [To put a new bandage] to begin with, is forbidden in either place. We may tie a string [of an instrument, which broke on Shabbat] in the Temple, but not in the [rest of the] country. [To tie a new string] to begin with, is forbidden in either place. We may cut [off] a wart in the Temple, but not  in the [rest of the] country. But if [we cut it off] with an instrument, [it is] forbidden in either place.",
            "If a <i>Kohen</i> [member of the priestly caste, a subgroup of tribe of Levi, which is uniquely responsible for maintaining and carrying out the sacrificial services in the Temple] is injured on his finger, he may bind reeds upon [this wound] in the Temple [on the Shabbat], but not in the [rest of the] country. If [he does so] to squeeze out blood, [it] is forbidden in either place. We may strew salt on the ramp [of the altar on Shabbat], so that they [the ministering priests] don't slip; and we may draw water from the Golah Cistern and from the Large Cistern, with a rolling wheel, [even] on Sabbat, and from the Cold Well on a festival day [but not on Shabbat].",
            "If a [dead] <i>sheretz</i> [a specific type of small animal, such as some insects, reptiles, or rodents, which move by scurrying, creeping, slithering, etc., the vast majority of which are prohibited for consumption] is found in the Temple [on Shabbat], the <i>Kohen</i> removes it with his belt, so as not to prolong the impurity [within the Temple] - so says Rabbi Yochanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Yehuda says, \"[He should remove it] with wooden pincers, so as not to increase [create more contamination from] the impurity.\" From where [in the Temple] must we remove it? From the sanctuary, from the vestibule, and from between the vestibule and the altar - so says Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas. Rabbi Akiva said, \"Every place, [in which if we entered while impure], if intentionally, we would be liable to be cut off; and if inadvertently, to bring a sin-offering, from there it must be removed. In all other places, it, we must cover it with a copper vessel [until after Shabbat, when it is removed].\" Rabbi Shimon says, \"[Whatever] the Sages permitted, they [only] gave you [permission to do] what is yours [not forbidden by the Torah]; since they only permitted you [that which is] a <i>shevut</i> [restrictions established by the Sages regarding Shabbat to prevent violation of Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions, and to increase its sanctity].\""
