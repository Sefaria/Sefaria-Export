            "\tA mavui (an alleyway) which is higher than twenty cubits — he diminishes. [A mavui which is not wider than sixteen cubits, even though it is open on its two ends to the public domain; or else, sixteen cubits wide, but not mefulash (open on both ends), but one end open to the public domain and the other closed — By Torah law it is permitted to carry therein without any tikun (act of amendment). But the rabbis decreed against it lest he come to carry in the public domain, and they permitted it with a lechi (a stake fastened in the ground) or a korah (a beam, laid crosswise) to serve as a sign. If he placed the korah higher than twenty he \"diminishes.\" That is, he lowers the korah below twenty. For above twenty the eye does not notice it. But if there are amaltera, i.e., designs and carvings, even above twenty cubits, it does not require lowering; for the amaltera cause it to be noticed.] R. Yehudah says: It is not necessary. [For the purpose of the korah is not to serve as a sign but to act as a partition. For we say: \"The mouth of the ceiling descends and closes up.\" This being so, what difference does it make whether it is within twenty cubits or higher? The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] And if it is wider than ten cubits, he diminishes. [For if it is wider than ten cubits, it is not called an \"opening,\" but a \"breach,\" and we require an opening. Therefore, he diminishes the width of the entrance until it is ten or less.] But if it has a tzurath hapetach (\"the appearance of an entrance\"), even if it is wider than ten cubits, he need not diminish. [Wherever the sages say \"tzurath hapetach,\" there suffices even a stick on one side and a stick on the other, twenty cubits or higher, and a stick above them, even if it does not touch them, and even if it is more than three cubits above them. All of the \"cubits\" (amoth) mentioned in this Mishnah and in all of Eruvin, Succah, and Kilayim, are an amah of six tefachim (handbreadths); each tefach, four fingers and the thumb. It is just that sometimes the measurement must be made with \"tefach atzev,\" i.e., not leaving any space between the two thumbs, but having them touch; and, sometimes, with space between the two thumbs, not having them touch, this being called \"tefach sochek.\" How so? When the measurement with tefach atzev is for stringency (of ruling), as with a mavui higher than twenty cubits, in which instance he must diminish, and with a succah higher than twenty cubits, which is pasul (unfit), he measures with tefach atzev. And when the measurement with tefach sochek is for stringency, as with a mavui, which may not be lower than ten tefachim, and with a succah lower than ten tefachim, he measures with a tefach sochek; and so, in all instances.]",
            "\tWhat is required for a mavui [so that it be permitted to carry therein through shituf (partnership)] — Beth Shammai say: Lechi and korah. [Both are required, Beth Hillel holding that by Torah law four complete partitions are required, and halachah leMosheh miSinai (\"a law unto Moses upon Sinai\") permits lechi and korah as the fourth.] And Beth Hillel say: Either lechi or korah, [Torah law requiring three complete partitions and no more, and the halachah leMosheh miSinai adding the fourth through a lechi of any size or through a korah as sign of partition. \"Mavui\" here is a mavui closed on three sides and open to the public domain on the fourth, with its length greater than its width. For if length and width were equal, it would be like a breached chatzer (courtyard) opening into the public domain, requiring a board (pas) somewhat longer than four cubits, or two boards of any size. Likewise, a chatzer breached into the public domain is regarded as a mavui and is permitted with a lechi or a korah. And a mavui permitted through a lechi differs from one permitted through a korah. For a mavui permitted through a lechi is regarded as having four partitions and one who throws something into it from the public domain is liable, whereas a mavui permitted through a korah, even though it is permitted to carry therein through shituf, is not an absolute private domain, and one who throws something into it from the public domain is not liable, it being ruled that a korah serves as a sign (distinguishing the mavui from the public domain), and a lechi, as a partition.] R. Eliezer says: Two lechis. [He holds with Beth Shammai and requires a lechi on either side. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.] It was said in the name of R. Yishmael that a certain disciple [R. Meir] said in the presence of R. Akiva: Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel do not differ in respect to a mavui [the width of] which is less than four cubits, [both agreeing] that either a lechi or a korah [suffices]. Where do they differ? Where it is from four to ten cubits, Beth Shammai requiring lechi and korah, and Beth Hillel, either lechi or korah. R. Akiva said: They differ in respect to both. [And the first tanna also holds that no distinction is made between wide and narrow. The Talmud explains that they (the first tanna and R. Akiva) differ in respect to a mavui less than four tefachim in width, one holding that neither lechi nor korah is required, and the other, that either lechi or korah is required. And it is not clear from their statements who requires it and who does not.]",
            "\tThe aforementioned \"korah\" must be wide enough to receive an ariach (a small brick) [so that a permanent structure could be built upon it.] And an ariach is half a brick of three tefachim, [so that an ariach is a tefach and a half wide.] It is sufficient that the korah be a tefach wide to receive an ariach along its length. [This is what is meant: If the korah is a tefach wide, the additional half tefach by which the ariach is wider (the ariach being a tefach and a half) can be plastered the width of a finger on either side, so that it will be wide enough to receive an ariach. Thus is it explained in the gemara.]",
            "\t(The korah must be) wide enough to receive an ariach and strong enough to receive an ariach [i.e., to support its weight without breaking. And this is the halachah.] R. Yehudah says: Wide enough, even if it is not strong enough.",
            "\tIf it (the korah) were of straw or of reeds, it is viewed as if it were made of metal. [R. Yehudah says this. The halachah is not in accordance with him.] If it were crooked, [so that an ariach could not rest upon it (as it also could not if it were round)], it is viewed as if it were straight. If it were round, it is viewed as if it were square. Whatever is three tefachim in circumference is one tefach in width. [That is, what is the required measure for a round korah? Whatever is three tefachim in circumference — i.e., whatever requires a cord three tefachim long to go around it — would, if squared, have a width of a tefach. For thus do we find with the yam (the reservoir) made by Solomon, viz. (I Kings 7:23): \"And he made the molten yam, ten cubits from brim to brim, round all about … and a line of thirty cubits compassed it roundabout\" — whence it is seen that for every cubit of width in the circle, there are three cubits of circumference.]",
            "\tThe aforementioned lechis (1:2) [The lechis concerning which R. Eliezer and the sages differ, R. Eliezer requiring two and the rabbis one — these are their specifications:] They must be ten tefachim high, [as the height of the mavui, whose height is not less than ten tefachim. And even if the mavui were much higher, a lechi of ten tefachim suffices], and any size in breadth and thickness. R. Yossi says: They must be three tefachim wide, [something substantial being required as a partition. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yossi.]",
            "\tAnything may be used as a lechi, even a living thing. R. Yossi forbids it, [fearing that it might die and no longer be ten tefachim high, and people, not noticing it, continue to rely upon it.] And it (a living thing) renders unclean by reason of golel (\"top-stone\"). [If he made it the golel of a grave, it always renders unclean if touched by a man or vessels, as a tent over a dead body, even if it were taken from there, it being written (Numbers 19:16): \"And all that touch on the face of the field one slain by the sword, etc.\", which is expounded to include golel and dofek (grave-frame). \"Golel\" is the grave cover.] R. Meir rules it clean. [The rationale pf R. Meir: Any partition which stands by virtue of a living spirit is not a partition. This is not the halachah.] And divorces may be written upon it (an animal). R. Yossi Haglili rules it unfit, [it being written (Deuteronomy 24:1): \"Then he shall write her a scroll of divorce.\" Just as a scroll has no living spirit, so, all that has no living spirit (is valid as a divorce). And the rabbis? (They would say:) If it were written: \"And he shall write to her in a scroll,\" it would be as you say. But now that it is written: \"He shall write her a sefer,\" sippur devarim, \"relating of words\" (of divorce) is what is intended. The halachah is in accordance with the first tanna. And if he wrote her a divorce on the horn of a cow and gave her the cow, in which instance it does not require cutting off after being written, it is kasher. But if he did not give her the cow, but only the horn, since he must cut if off, she is not divorced with it.]",
            "\tIf a caravan encamped in a valley and it were fenced around by animal gear, it is permitted to carry therein, so long as the fence be ten tefachim high and the (composite length of the) breaches not greater than (that of) the structure. [And even if the breaches are smaller than ten (amoth), if more is breached than standing, it is not a partition, and it is forbidden (to carry) even opposite what is standing.] Every breach which is within ten amoth (in length) is permitted, being like an entrance. [This, provided that what stands is more than or equal to what is breached, in which instance there is a (valid) partition, and it is permitted to carry (even) opposite the breach.] More than that (ten amoth) is forbidden. [Even one breach larger than ten (amoth) forbids (i.e., invalidates) the entire fencing, even if what stands is more (than what is breached), for people do not make entrances larger than ten — so that it is a breach (and not an entrance). And this, only if it does not have tzurath petach (\"the appearance of an entrance\"); but if it does, even more than ten is (regarded as) an entrance.]",
            "\tThey may fence it [a caravan that encamped in a valley] around with three ropes [tied to stakes]; the second above the first, and the third above the second, so long as between rope and rope there are not three tefachim. [From the bottom rope to the ground there are fewer than three tefachim, so that it is like a standing (partition). For any space less than three (tefachim) is considered a solid. And from there to the middle rope there are fewer than three, making a \"standing\" of six tefachim less two small measures for the two spaces. And from the middle to the top, fewer than three tefachim, making nine tefachim less three small measures of \"standing\" in the three spaces.] The (combined) thickness of the ropes must be [three small measures] more than a tefach, so that the whole be ten tefachim.",
            "\tThey may fence it with reeds [stuck in the ground and standing straight (a perpendicular partition; that of ropes, being a horizontal one)], so long as there not be more than three tefachim between one reed and the next. This was stated in respect to a caravan. [They were lenient with them, requiring either a perpendicular arrangement, as with reeds, or a horizontal one, as with ropes; but they were not lenient with an individual, requiring both perpendicular and horizontal. (Three men are considered a \"caravan.\")] These are the words of R. Yehudah. The sages said: They spoke of a \"caravan\" only as being the common instance, (but it is permitted even with an individual.) Any partition which is not (both) perpendicular and horizontal is no partition. These are the words of R. Yossi b. R. Yehudah. [R. Yossi b. R. Yehudah differs with his father, saying that even a caravan requires perpendicular and horizontal.] The difference between the first rabbis and the second: The first rabbis permitted it to an individual only in an instance like that of a caravan, i.e., when he is on the road and cannot make a regular partition, but not when he is in the settlement. And the second rabbis say: Either way (perpendicular or horizontal), whether for an individual or for many; whether on the road or in a settlement. And the halachah is in accordance with them. But one man or two who camped in the desert may not make a partition larger than beth sa'atayim, one hundred cubits in length by fifty in width, as per the tabernacle court. And three or more men constitute a \"caravan,\" and they may make a large partition, even several mil, as may be required by them, their belongings, and their beasts, so long as there be no empty space larger than a beth sa'atayim in the partition. Those who go out to war [even a sanctioned war (milchemeth reshuth, as opposed to milchemeth mitzvah)] were exempt from four things: They may bring wood from anywhere, [with no concern over theft, even if it were cut and piled by the owners]; they are exempt from washing their hands [before a meal. (But they are required to wash after the meal, that washing having been prescribed by reason of Sodomite salt, which causes blindness. A risk (to life) is of greater stringency than a prohibition.)]; (they are exempt) from demai [They are not required to separate terumath ma'aser from demai (suspect produce), as when they bought produce from an am ha'aretz]; (and they are exempt) from making an eruv [an eruv of courts, such as from tent to tent within the camp surrounded by partitions; but they are required to make an eruv of (Sabbath) bounds.]"

            "\tBoards are placed (upright) around wells [in the public domain. For the wells are private domain, being ten tefachim deep, so that it is not permitted to draw water from them and take it out to the public domain. Therefore, boards are arranged to form an enclosure around the well as a private domain. He can then draw water from the well and place it there, and bring in his beast entirely or its head and most of its body and water it] — four dioamudin, giving the appearance of eight (boards). [\"dioamudin\" - \"two amudin\" (boards), each one of these four (corner-pieces) giving the appearance of two boards (\"dio,\" Greek for \"two\"). When he sticks one of the corner-pieces in the southwest corner, one wall extends to the east and the other to the north; the second in the northwest corner — one wall to the east, and the other, to the south. So that when he places all four on all four sides, each side has two cubits of wall, cubit facing cubit and a space in between.] These are the words of R. Yehudah. R. Meir says: Eight (boards), giving the appearance of twelve — four dioamudin and four plain boards, (each board) ten tefachim high, six tefachim (= 1 cubit) wide, any thickness, and between them ,the distance of two teams (revakoth) of three (heads of) cattle. These are the words of R. Meir. [(\"four plain boards\":) a one-cubit board on each side in the middle. When there are ten cubits or less between the boards of these four corner-pieces, R. Meir concurs that plain boards are not needed. And when there are more than thirteen and a third cubits between them, R. Yehudah concurs that plain boards are required. They differ only (in respect to a distance of) from ten to thirteen and a third cubits, R. Meir requiring plain boards and R. Yehudah not requiring them. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah. (\"two revakoth of three (heads of) cattle\":) For the width of each (head of) cattle is one and two-thirds cubits — so that the width of six (heads of) cattle is found to be ten cubits, this being the permitted distance between one board and the other according to R. Meir, a greater distance requiring the addition of plain boards. (\"revakoth:\") as in (I Samuel 28:24): \"egel (a calf) marbek.\"] R. Yehudah says: (Two teams) of four (heads of) cattle [thirteen and a third cubits], tied and not free [So that it not be thought that \"as if tied,\" but not literally \"tied,\" is intended, it is stated \"and not free\" — for greater stringency, to reduce the space between them], one [team] entering and another leaving, [in which instance there is more space than for two leaving or two entering — for greater lenity, less constriction being required.]",
            "\tIt is permitted to place [the boards] closer to the well [and to form a small enclosure], so long as [from the edge of the well until the boards there are two cubits (the length of the head and most of the body of the cow), so that] the head and most of the body be within when it drinks, [but not less, lest he follow his cow and take the pail outside the enclosure.] It is permitted to place (the boards) farther, any distance, [to make the enclosure as large as he wishes], so long as he adds boards. [For the farther the distance from the well, the greater the space between the boards. He, therefore, must add boards so that the distance between board and board or board and dioamud be no greater than thirteen and a third cubits, as per R. Yehudah, whose ruling is followed.]",
            "\tR. Yehudah says: [He should make not make an enclosure for the well greater than] until beth sa'atayim (the size of a field requiring two sa'ah of seed). They said to him: They said \"beth sa'atayim\" only for a garden or a karpef, [which do not serve for habitation. A karpef is a large enclosure outside the city, where wood is stored.] But in a corral [set up in the fields (today, here; tomorrow, there) in order to fertilize the field with animal dung], or a sachar (an enclosure) [for animals in the city (Some read it \"sahar\" (a prison yard)], or a muktzeh [a space behind the house], or a chatzer [an open space in front of the house] — even (in) five kur it is permitted (to carry), even in ten kur. [For all of these serve for habitation. And, likewise, the boards of wells. Since the water is fit to be drunk by men, a bona fide (human) function is served.] And it is permitted to place (the boards) farther, any distance, so long as he adds boards. [That is, just as one may carry in all of the above, which serve for habitation, even if they are as large as ten kur, so one may move the enclosure of well boards as far as he wishes. And this is the halachah.]",
            "\tR Yehudah says: If a public path intervened [between the boards], he diverts it (the path) to the side [outside of the boards, so that people not walk between the boards. For this would render it a public domain and negate the enclosure.] The sages say: He need not do so. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] Boards may be used (as an enclosure) for both public (water) pits, [in which instance, if the water is used up, they remind each other (not to carry in the enclosure). For they permitted well-boards only so that water be available for the beasts of the festival pilgrims. And if there is no water there, the boards do not have the status of an enclosure.], public wells, and individual wells. [These are also permitted; for, being live wells, their water is not depleted.] But for an individual (water) pit, a partition ten tefachim high must be made. These are the words of R. Akiva. R. Yehudah b. Bava says: Boards may be used only for a public well, [in that it possesses two positive features. And this is the halachah. And it is permitted to draw water and to take it from the well using well-boards only in order to water the beasts of the festival pilgrims and in Eretz Yisrael alone. But it is forbidden to take out water for a man himself to drink. Instead, he must go down in it and drink or make a partition ten tefachim high.], and for the others, he must make a \"belt\" (partition) ten tefachim high.",
            "\tR. Yehudah b. Bava said further: It is permitted to carry in a garden and a karpef which are seventy cubits and a remnant by seventy cubits and a remnant surrounded by a gate ten tefachim high [Since he stated one stringency vis-à-vis boards, i.e., that they may be used only for a public well, and he now states another stringency, that even when serving for habitation more than beth sa'atayim was not permitted, \"further\" is stated.] so long as there be within it a watcher's booth [(For even though it serves for habitation, only beth sa'atayim is permitted, and not more)], or a house to dwell in, or (so long as it be) close to the city. [For since it is close to his house, he intends to use it constantly, so that it is regarded as serving for habitation.] R. Yehudah says: Even if there is within it only a hole, a pit, or a cave, he may carry within it. R. Akiva says: even if none of the above is in it, he may carry within it, so long as there be within it seventy cubits and a remnant (four tefachim) by seventy cubits and a remnant. [And not more. And the first tanna, above (2:3), viz.: \"They said to him: They said 'beth sa'atayim' only for a garden or a karpef, but in a corral, or a sachar, or a chatzer, etc.\" — that tanna also holds with R. Akiva, that where there is a habitation, only beth sa'atayim is permitted. Where do they differ? The gemara explains that they differ with regard to the small amount by which beth sa'atayim exceeds seventy cubits and a remnant squared, the first tanna holding that a complete beth sa'atayim is permitted; and R. Akiva, seventy cubits and a remnant by seventy cubits and a remnant and no more. And whence do we derive that beth sa'atayim is greater than seventy cubits and a remnant squared? The gemara asks: How much is sa'atayim? (And it answers:) As the court of the tabernacle, of which it is written (Exodus 27:18): \"The length of the court shall be one hundred cubits, and its width, fifty by fifty. And it is expounded: What is the intent of \"fifty by fifty\"? The Torah is telling us: Take the fifty by which the length exceeds the width and \"surround\" the fifty that are left to arrive at the (permitted) Sabbath limit — seventy cubits and four tefachim squared. How so? Make of them five strips of ten cubits wide by fifty cubits long. Place one to the east (of the fifty by fifty) and another to the west, so that we now have seventy wide by fifty long. Place one (strip) to the south and another to the north, and we now have seventy by seventy; but the corners are defective (i.e., unfilled), each corner being ten by ten cubits by reason of the addition. From the fifth strip take four pieces of ten (by ten) with which to fill up the four corners. Take the remaining ten by ten, which are sixty tefachim by sixty tefachim (1 cubit = six tefachim), and make of them thirty strips of two tefachim each, each one ten cubits long — all together, three hundred cubits long. Place seventy on each side, so that there are now seventy cubits and four tefachim by seventy cubits and four tefachim. But the corners are defective, two tefachim by two tefachim. This leaves you with twenty cubits. Take eight tefachim and fill up the corners. You are left with eighteen cubits and four tefachim length by two cubits width. And this is the \"small amount.\" For if you spread them around equally, the additional width amounts to two-thirds of a finger. For you must make of it a strip 283 cubits long to surround the four sides. Thus did I find it explained in Rashi, and it is correct. Rambam \"sought many accountings,\" but I was unable to fathom him. The ruling is in accordance with R. Akiva in \"Even if none of the above is in it, he may carry within it.\" But in his differing with the sages of \"They said to him, etc.\" above, contending that it must be (at most) seventy and a remnant (four tefachim) by seventy and a remnant, and no more — in this, the halachah is in accordance with the sages. For it is permitted with beth sa'atayim, as (the area of) the court of the tabernacle, which is somewhat more than seventy cubits and a remnant squared.] R. Eliezer says: If its length were greater than its width by even one cubit, it is not permitted to carry therein [even if he reduced the width and added to the length, so that in the whole there were not more than beth sa'atayim. For it is only a square that the rabbis permitted when it does not serve as a habitation.] R. Yossi says: Even if its length were twice its width, it is permitted to carry therein. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi, who differs with R. Eliezer, a square not being required.]",
            "\tR. Ilai said: I heard from R. Eliezer: Even if it were as (large as) a beth kur. [This refers to the argument vis-à-vis garden and karpef above.] I also heard from him: The men of the courtyard — if one of them forgot and did not make an eruv, he is forbidden to carry into and out of his house, but they are permitted to do so. [If the next day (Shabbath), he gave up his rights in the courtyard to his neighbors (for he had forbidden them to carry from their houses to the courtyard, the courtyard being their common domain, and his part being forbidden to them) — by giving up his rights in the courtyard, he also gives up his rights in his house, even though he does not say so explicitly, and he becomes a \"guest\" of theirs. For this reason, even his house is permitted to them. But he is forbidden to carry in and out of his house to the courtyard, even though he is permitted to carry in and out of their houses to the courtyard (as anyone who enters his neighbor's house, who is permitted to carry therefrom to the courtyard, it being the domain of one person.) Still, he is forbidden to carry out from his house. And we do not say that since he gave up to them his rights to his house it is regarded as their house. For as soon as he takes something out from his house to the courtyard, he regains possession of his property, and forbids it to them. This, as we learned in respect to one dwelling together with a gentile — If he gave up his rights and then, again carried something out, whether unwittingly or wittingly, he forbids it (to the other)]. And I also heard from him that one fulfills his obligation [of maror] on Pesach with akrevanim [a vegetable whose leaves resemble a scorpion (akrav). And I have heard (that it is) bast growing around the palm.] and I questioned all of his disciples, seeking a second [for these three things, i.e., one who would say that he, too, had heard it from him], and I could not find one. [And the halachah is not in accordance with any of them. For in respect to garden and karpef, more than beth sa'atayim was not permitted. And in respect to the men of a courtyard, one of whom forgot to make an eruv, and gave up his rights (in the courtyard), but not in his house, his house is forbidden to them, too; but it is permitted (to carry) from their houses to the courtyard. And akrevanim are not maror, and one does not fulfill his obligation with them on Pesach.]"

            "\tAn eruv and a partnership [in a mavui (see 1:1)] is made with all (foods), except with water and salt. [We are speaking here of eruvin of tchumin (Sabbath bounds); for eruvin of chatzeroth (courtyards) are made only with bread. \"With all\" in our Mishnah is non-categorical, as stated in the gemara: \"We do not learn (rules) from generalizations, even those qualified by 'except.'\" For here we learn \"An eruv is made with all (foods), except with water and salt,\" even though we also do not make an eruv with morils and truffles, they, too, not being foods, like water and salt.] And all (foods) may be bought with ma'aser (sheni) money, [it being written (Deuteronomy 14:26): \"And you shall give the money for all that your soul desires\"], except water and salt, [this not being \"fruit of a fruit\"].

But terumah cannot be rendered permissible to an Israelite. For even if he were \"absolved\" of his terumah-taking, so that it is as if it were never taken, it returns to its state of tevel, and may not be eaten until a different terumah is taken. But terumah may not be taken on Shabbath, even at twilight; therefore, it cannot be permitted to him.

Beth hapras is a field in which a grave has been plowed up. A Cohein may enter there when he \"blows\" as he walks, taking care not to touch a bone the size of a barley-corn. He is, therefore, permitted to place his eruv there; for he can go to the place where he placed his eruv, and he and his eruv be in the same spot.] R. Yehudah says: (An eruv may be made for him) even in a cemetery, for he can make a partition and eat. [He can make a partition between himself and the grave, so that he not \"tent\" over it, as by entering in a closed wagon, in which instance it is permitted to him. The gemara states that the rabbis differ with R. Yehudah even vis-à-vis an Israelite, ruling that it is forbidden to place an eruv in a cemetery, \"Cohein\" being stated only to apprise us of the \"power\" of R. Yehudah, that it is permitted even with a Cohein. The rationale of their difference: R. Yehudah holds that even though it is forbidden to derive benefit from a cemetery, it is permitted to place an eruv there, a Sabbath-bound eruv being made only for the sake of a mitzvah, and mitzvoth not having been given for \"benefit.\" And even though the eruv is \"guarded\" there after he acquires (halachic habitation), this being effected at twilight; and the eruv remains after he has performed the mitzvah, the entire Shabbath — R. Yehudah holds that one is not concerned if his eruv is lost or stolen after he acquires (halachic habitation). And the rabbis hold that one is concerned, desiring that it not be stolen. Therefore, with the eruv being \"guarded\" in the cemetery the entire Shabbath after he has acquired (habitation) at twilight and his mitzvah having been completed, he is found to be deriving benefit from graves, something which is forbidden. Therefore, one may not place an eruv in a cemetery. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tIt is permitted to make an eruv with demai (produce which is \"suspect\" as improperly tithed). [(It is permitted to make an eruv) with a loaf taken from an am ha'aeretz, from which terumath ma'aser of demai has not been separated.], and with ma'aser rishon whose terumah has been taken, and with ma'aser sheni and hekdesh which had been redeemed; and Cohanim, with challah and with terumah, but not with tevel (untithed grain), and not with ma'aser rishon whose terumah had not been taken, and not with ma'aser sheni and hekdesh which had not been redeemed. [All of these are explained in Shabbath (18:1)]. If one sends his eruv through a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, or through one who does not acknowledge (the institution of) eruv, [such as a Cuthite or a Sadducee], it is not valid. [(\"If one sends his eruv\":) to take it to the end of two thousand cubits. And it is only with eruvei techumin that it is not valid if he sent it through a minor; but with eruvei chatzeroth it is ruled that a minor may be deputed with an eruv.] And if he told another to accept it from him, it is valid. [(If he told another) who is kasher to accept it from the pasul (the unfit one) and to carry it to the end of two thousand cubits, it is valid, so long as he stands and witnesses the pasul placing it into the hand of the kasher, even if he does not see the kasher carrying it; for it is assumed that a messenger performs his embassy.]",
            "\tIf he placed it in a tree [ four by four tefachim or more, standing in a public domain], higher than ten tefachim, his eruv is not valid. [For since the tree is four tefachim wide, higher than ten, it is a private domain, and he acquires habitation in the public domain. So that if he wished to take his eruv and eat it at the time the eruv effects acquisition for him, i.e., ben hashmashoth (at twilight), he would not be permitted to do so, for he would be taking it from a private to a public domain. Therefore, it is not a valid eruv.] Below ten tefachim, his eruv is an eruv. [For below ten tefachim is a karmelith (anything three to nine tefachim high and four wide being a \"karmelith.\") Taking the eruv, then, would involve only a (rabbinic) interdict of shvuth (resting). Therefore, it is a valid eruv. Our Mishnah is in accordance with Rebbi, who says: Anything which is interdicted by reason of shvuth was not decreed against ben hashmashoth. At the time the eruv effects acquisition for him — ben hashmashoth — he is permitted to take it, so that \"he and his eruv are in one spot,\" for which reason it is a valid eruv.] If he placed it in a hole [in a karmelith, as in a valley or in a field, desiring to acquire habitation in the valley or in the field], even if it were a hundred cubits deep, his eruv is valid. [For the hole itself is a private domain, and he acquires habitation in the karmelith. For at the time the eruv effects acquisition for him — ben hashmashoth — he is permitted to take it. This, in accordance with Rebbi, who says: Anything which is interdicted by reason of shvuth was not decreed against ben hashmashoth.] If he placed it on top of a reed or on top of a pole, which was uprooted and stuck (in the ground) [and which is not four tefachim wide below, in which instance it is not a private domain] — even if it is a hundred feet high, it is a valid eruv, [even though it is four tefachim wide above (for an eruv must be on top of a place of four tefachim.) (\"uprooted and stuck\":) Only then is it an eruv, but not if it were rooted — a decree, lest when he takes the eruv, he breaks it. For a reed, being soft, is susceptible of being broken. But a tree is hard, and ben hashmashoth there is no apprehension of \"lest he go up and tear off (fruits).\" But, we do fear that he will lop off the reed and be liable by reason of kotzer (\"harvesting\"). Or, with reed and pole, there is a possibility that he will confuse what is rooted for what is torn off; for many reeds which are uprooted and stuck in the ground give the appearance of being rooted, for which reason it is to be decreed lest he lop off what is rooted, thinking it to be unrooted. But with a tree, there is basis for a decree of lest he go up and tear off, thinking it to be unrooted.] If he placed it in a closet and lost the key, it is a valid eruv, [as when the lock were tied with ropes in such a manner that if the key were not found, they could be cut only with a knife. The first tanna holds that since it could be opened by cutting the ropes with a knife, there is no skilah (stoning) interdict here, but one of shvuth (resting), the one who opens it \"destroying\" in the cutting of the ropes, all who thus \"destroy\" not being liable. And anything interdicted by reason of shvuth was not decreed against ben hashmashoth, as stated above. Therefore, it is a valid eruv; for he can bring a knife, cut the ropes and take the eruv.] R. Eliezer says: If he does not know that the key is in its place it is not a valid eruv. [R. Eliezer holds that an instrument may be handled only for its regular use and that it is forbidden to take a knife to cut ropes with, it being used regularly to cut food with. And since there are two (interdicted acts), the handling of the knife and the cutting of the ropes — even Rebbi, who says that anything forbidden by reason of shvuth was not interdicted ben hashmashoth — even Rebbi concurs that in this instance they did decree. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.]",
            "\tIf it rolled outside the tchum, or a heap fell upon it, or it were burned, or it were terumah and it became unclean while it was still day, it is not an eruv. [(\"If it rolled outside the tchum\":) Since there are from the house where he lodges until his eruv more than two thousand cubits, he cannot go and take it. This, if it rolled two cubits outside two thousand cubits. For every man has four cubits from the place of his eruv, two cubits from the east of the eruv and two cubits from the west. (\"or a heap fell upon it\":) This, if it requires hoe or pick-axe to dig it out, in which instance it is a (forbidden Sabbath) labor and not shvuth. (\"or if it were terumah and it became unclean\":) For now it is fit neither for him nor for others. The tanna must apprise us of both \"it rolled\" and \"a heap.\" For with \"it rolled,\" since it is not together with him, \"he is in one place, and his eruv in another\"; but with \"a heap,\" where it is with him (i.e., within the tchum), I might say that it would be a valid eruv (if I were not apprised otherwise.) And if I were apprised of \"a heap,\" (I might say that it is not valid) because he can get it only with the (interdicted) labor of hoe and pick-axe, but with \"it rolled,\" where a wind might blow it back into the tchum, I might say that it should be valid. We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise. And \"burned\" is taught to apprise us of the power of R. Yossi (below), that even though it is not in the world (when burned), it is not invalidated because of doubt. And \"terumah that became unclean\" is taught to apprise us of the \"power\" of R. Meir, that even though it is \"in the world,\" so that there is reason to confirm it in its original status of \"clean,\" still, we do not accept \"status\" for leniency of ruling.] (If these things happened) after dark, it is a valid eruv. [For since he acquired (habitation) ben hashmashoth, we are not concerned about its going lost.] In the instance of a doubt, R. Meir and R. Yehudah say: \"He is leading a camel and an ass.\" [For we are in doubt. It is possible that his eruv effected acquisition (of habitation), so that his house is here (at the eruv site), and from here he can walk two thousand cubits in all directions; and he has lost two thousand cubits from his home (starting point). Or it may be that his eruv did not effect acquisition, so that from his home he can walk two thousand cubits in all directions, and he has acquired nothing around his eruv. Because of this doubt, he may walk only the two thousand cubits from his home to the eruv, for this is permitted in any event; but he may not walk the two thousand cubits from his eruv, for it may be that his eruv did not effect acquisition. And from his home, too, (he may not walk in other directions), for it may be that his eruv did effect acquisition. So that this (his home) \"pulls\" him here, and that (his eruv) \"pulls\" him there, like a man leading an ass and a camel. The ass walks before him and he leads it; and the camel walks behind him and he pulls it, so that he must turn back and forth.] R. Yossi and R. Shimon say: In an instance of doubt, the eruv is kasher. [For we confirm the eruv in its (original) status. When he placed it there, it was within the tchum, and clean, and there was no heap upon it, so that it is a valid eruv. And this is the halachah.] R. Yossi said: Avtulmos testified in the name of five elders that in an instance of doubt the eruv is kasher.",

And even though they come only on the morrow (Sabbath), we say that there is breirah (retroactive designation), that ben hashmashoth his eruv on the other side (the west) effected acquisition for him.] (He says:) \"If they come from both sides, I shall go wherever I choose.\" \"If they come from neither side, I am as one of the (other) men of my city.\" [i.e., I have two thousand cubits from my city on every side, and I need not gain in one direction and lose in another.] \"If the sage comes from the east, my eruv is to the east; if from the west, it is to the west.\" [(If he comes) outside the tchum of my city, and I wish to learn from him — and now I do not know whether he will come — and tomorrow I will hear from men who come here from there by means of an eruv, etc.] \"If he (i.e., a sage) comes from either side, I shall go wherever I choose.\" \"If he comes from neither side, I am as one of the (other) men of my city.\" R. Yehudah says: If [they came from both sides and] one of them were his teacher, he goes to his teacher [and not to the other, for we posit that when his eruv effected acquisition ben hashmashoth, his will was that the eruv in the direction of his teacher do so.], and if both of them were his teachers, he goes whither he wishes. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah, one sometimes favoring his friend over his teacher.]",
            "\tR. Eliezer says: Yom Tov close to Shabbath, both (immediately) before it or after it — one places two eruvin and says: \"My first eruv is to the east, and the second, to the west\" (or) \"My first to the west and the second to the east.\" [If he had to go in one direction on the first day, and in a different direction the second day, he can place an eruv to the east and to the west on the eve of the first day and say: \"Let my eruv to the east effect acquisition for me today for tomorrow, and let my eruv to the west effect acquisition for me ben hashmashoth tomorrow for the second day.\" For R. Eliezer holds that Shabbath and yom tov are not regarded as one long day, but as two separate sanctities, and the ben hashmashoth of the first effects acquisition for itself and not for the second day.] \"My eruv is (for) the first (day); and on the second, as the people of my city.\" [That is, if he needed to go only on the first day, and on the second, he did not need to move from his spot, and he does not wish to lose two thousand from his tchum in either direction, he places one eruv in the direction he wishes to go the first day, and he says: \"Let his eruv effect acquisition for me for tomorrow, and on the second day, I shall be as the men of my city,\" who did not make an eruv. Or, if he had to go on the second day and not on the first, he says: \"Let this eruv effect acquisition for me ben hashmashoth tomorrow, and on the first day I shall be as the men of my city.\"] And the sages say: He makes an eruv in one direction (for both days) or he does not make an eruv at all; or he makes an eruv for two days or he does not make an eruv at all. [This is the same as \"in one direction\" above. Why need it be mentioned? This is what the rabbis are saying to R. Eliezer: Do you not concur that for one day he makes an eruv either in one direction or not at all? For he cannot say: \"Let my eruv be a half day to the east and a half day to the west.\" For two days, too — that is, for Shabbath and yom tov — he makes an eruv as for one day or he does not make an eruv at all. For the rabbis are in doubt as to whether or not Shabbath and yom tov are regarded as one day. So they rule stringently here — that he may not make an eruv in two directions, in that they might constitute one sanctity — and stringently there, saying below that if it were eaten on the first day, there is no eruv for the second day, in that they might constitute two distinct sanctities and not be regarded as one long day.] What does he do (if he desires the eruv for two days in one direction)? He [the messenger] takes it on the first day [i.e., on the eve of the yom tov before Shabbath], and he waits for dark [until the eruv effects acquisition.] Then he takes it and returns, [lest it go lost and he have no eruv for the second day, as it is taught: \"If his eruv were eaten on the first day, it is an eruv for the first day but not for the second.\"], and on the second day he waits for dark and eats it. [He takes it back on the second day. For it is ruled that if one makes an eruv with a loaf on the first day and he wishes to make an eruv with a loaf on the second day, he must do so with the very same eruv that he designated as such the day before (saying nothing), but not with a different loaf. For he would have to designate it as an eruv, and this would constitute preparation from yom tov to Shabbath.] So that he is found to gain in his going [That is, he effects acquisition for going (beyond the tchum) the next day], and (he is found) to gain in his eruv, [which he eats. And on yom tov after Shabbath, where this is not possible, he takes it there on the first day and does not eat it, and he returns there on the second day to see if it is still there. (If it is,) he waits for dark, after which he may eat it if he so desires.] If it were eaten on the first day, it is an eruv for the first but not for the second. R. Eliezer said to them: You concur with me that they are two (distinct) sanctities. [For you say that if his eruv were eaten on the first day, it does not serve for the second day. And if it were one sanctity, it would be reckoned as one long day, so that the ben hashmashoth of the first day would effect acquisition for both days. Since they are two sanctities, then, he can also make an eruv in two directions! And the rabbis follow the stringent ruling in both instances, as stated above, being in doubt (as to whether they are one or two sanctities.) The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer, that Shabbath and yom tov are two sanctities.]",

[For they hold that they are one sanctity. And the halachah is in accordance with the sages vis-à-vis the two days of Rosh Hashanah. For it is not because of doubt alone that two days were instituted, (doubt as to) whether beth-din had sanctified the thirtieth day or the thirty-first day and one of them is chol (i.e., not yom tov), but also because of the possibility that witnesses (had come) from minchah on, in which instance that day is observed as holy, and the next day as holy, both (together) being reckoned as one sanctity. But with the other festivals of the exile, where they instituted two days only because of doubt, our not knowing when the great beth-din had sanctified the new moon, the sages concur with R. Yehudah that they are two distinct sanctities. (The \"sages\" here are R. Yossi.)]",

And the next day he says: \"If yesterday was kodesh and today is chol, let what I designated yesterday be terumah for these; and if today is kodesh and yesterday was chol, it is terumah already.\" And he eats (from) the tithed basket and leaves over the terumah.] And the sages did not concur with him.

And this is so only with the two days of Rosh Hashanah, as explained above.] Likewise (R. Yehudah said that) an egg hatched on the first day [of Rosh Hashanah] may be eaten on the second. [For if the first is kodesh, the second is chol; and an egg hatched on yom tov is permitted on chol, there being no hachanah (\"preparation\") for chol. And if the first is chol and the second kodesh, chol is found, appropriately, to be preparing for kodesh.] And the sages did not concur with him [vis-à-vis the two days of Rosh Hashanah alone, regarding them as one sanctity; but they did concur with him vis-à-vis the two festival days of exile.]",

If they returned him [within the tchum], it is as if he had not left [and the entire city is as four cubits to him as in the beginning, and outside it two thousand cubits on every side.

Gamliel and R. Elazar b. Azaryah say: He may walk in all of it, [for since it is fenced off, it is like four cubits.] R. Yehoshua and R. Akiva say: He has only four cubits.

[And the rabbis differ with R. Shimon on this, saying that all are forbidden with each other. R. Shimon now says to the rabbis: Is not the instance of three men and the middle one \"swallowed\" between them, where you concur that he is permitted with them and they are permitted with him — is that instance not similar to the instance of three courtyards?

But here, with three men, if one of the two outer ones came to take something into the two cubits of the outer one, the middle one would notice this and would warn him.

[Since he did not make explicit which four cubits he chose under the tree, this does not constitute (acquisition of) habitation, and he has only four cubits where he is. For he did not acquire habitation in his place, since he \"uprooted\" that intent. And he, likewise, did not acquire it under the tree.

Yaakov the dwelling of a gentile is not called a dwelling and, by law, he does not forbid; but the rabbis decreed (that he does forbid) so that an Israelite not come to dwell with an idolator and not learn from his deeds. The first tanna holds that even though a gentile is suspect of bloodshed and a Jew is forbidden to be alone with him, it sometimes happens that an Israelite dwells together with an idolator, and the rabbis ordained that an eruv not avail with a gentile and that negation of his (the gentile's) rights (in the courtyard) not avail, but that he must rent it (to the Jew).

Since at the moment it is a requirement for the service, it being unseemly for the sore to be visible during the service, it may be covered with bast.] (He may wrap bast around it) in the Temple, but not outside it, [healing on Shabbath being shvuth, and forbidden.] And if to remove blood, [i.e., tightening the bast to remove blood], it is forbidden in both places, [this being (the proto-labor) \"chovel\" (making a wound), and a proto-labor was not permitted in the Temple.] Salt may be crushed [and spread out] upon the ramp [leading up to the altar], so that they not slip, [for it was smooth, and sometimes they slipped and fell upon it.], but not outside it, [this constituting \"repairing.\"] It is permitted to draw water on Shabbath from \"the well of the exile\" and from \"the great well,\" [which were found in the chambers of the Temple court] with a wheel [made for raising the pail with ropes. It is only with these two wells that this was permitted, but with others, it was forbidden — a decree lest one draw water for his garden and for his dry land on Shabbath, the task being made easier (by the wheel). And in a place where there are no grounds for such a decree, it is permitted to draw water with a wheel. And we are not apprehensive as to the wheel's producing a sound, only musical sound production being forbidden (on Shabbath). Along the same lines, it is permitted to knock on the door or the gate on Shabbath.], and (it is permitted to draw water) from \"the kar well\" on a festival. [Because it was a spring-well, they called it \"the kar well,\" as in \"makor\" (\"source\"). This well was needed by the men of the exile on a festival, and the prophets among them, Chaggai and Zechariah, permitted their drawing water from it by wheel. And their permit remained in effect, allowing them to do so even outside the Temple on a festival, as opposed to (the ruling for) other spring-wells.]",
            "\tIf a sheretz (an unclean creeping thing) were found in the Temple, the Cohein removes it with his belt [on Shabbath, without apprehension of tiltul (forbidden moving) on Shabbath, there being no shvuth in the Temple.], in order not to keep tumah (uncleanliness) in the Temple. These are the words of R. Yochanan b. B'roka. [Even though he thereby renders his belt, which is kodesh (consecrated) unclean, it is preferable to keeping the tumah in the Temple court while looking for wooden tongs. And the Cohein does not touch it with his hands, so that he himself does not become unclean. He holds it in his belt, not touching it. The sheretz does not render unclean the one who carries it; the belt, which becomes unclean through the sheretz, does not render the Cohein unclean when he holds it. For the belt is of first-degree uncleanliness, and men and vessels acquire uncleanliness only through av hatumah (proto-uncleanliness)]. R. Yehudah says: (He removes it) with wooden tongs, [flat wooden vessels, which do not acquire uncleanliness] in order not to increase tumah, [i.e., (in order not) to render unclean the belt, which is clean. It is better to keep the sheretz there and to look for the tongs than to increase uncleanliness. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah.] From where is it taken out? From the heichal (the hall containing the golden altar), the ulam (the entrance hall), and between the ulam and the altar. These are the words of R. Shimon b. Naness. [But if he found it in the azarah (the Temple court), he covers it with a p'sachter (a large pot) and leaves it until dark.] R. Akiva says: Wherever he incurs kareth (cutting-off) for [entering] wittingly [in a state of tumah] and a sin-offering for [entering] unwittingly [i.e., in all of the azarah], from there, it is taken out; and in all other places, a p'sachter [a copper pot] is placed upon it. [(the targum of \"its pots\" (Exodus 27:3) is \"p'sachtravatei\") to cover it until dark. The halachah is in accordance with R. Akiva.] R. Shimon says: A place that the sages permitted to you, they gave you of what is yours; for they permitted to you only what is (interdicted) by reason of shvuth. [R. Shimon differs from the first tanna (10:13), who says that a string may be tied (with a knot) in the Temple. R. Shimon holds that the string of a lute that snapped may be tied only with a bow, which is (otherwise) forbidden only by reason of shvuth, and by which (mode of tying) one will not come to transgress a Torah prohibition. But it is forbidden to tie it with a knot, for that might lead one to transgression of a Torah interdict. R. Shimon says to the first tanna: Do not wonder that I am stringent here and relatively lenient with respect to tchumin, saying (4:11) that even if one went fifteen cubits outside the tchum he may re-enter. For in respect to tchumin, \"they gave you of what is yours,\" knowing that those fifteen cubits are not really outside the tchum. For we know that the surveyors, who place signs for the end of the tchum do not do so exactly at the end of two thousand cubits (but within that distance), because of those who err, not recognizing the signs, and sometimes going a little beyond the tchum and returning — for which reason I am lenient in respect to tchumin. But, in respect to tying a knot in the Temple, (since they permitted in the Temple only shvuth interdicts, but not Torah interdicts) — there, I rule stringently and say that they permitted only the tying of a bow, a shvuth interdict, but they did not permit the tying of a knot, which, in some instances, is forbidden by the Torah. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]"
