            "If an alleyway is enclosed on three sides with courtyards opening into it from three sides, and the fourth side opens into a public domain, it is prohibited by rabbinic law to carry objects in it on Shabbat. However, carrying in an alleyway under those circumstances is permitted if a cross beam is placed horizontally over the entrance to the alleyway. The mishna teaches that if the cross beam spans the entrance to <b>an alleyway</b> at a <b>height above twenty cubits, one must diminish</b> the height of the cross beam so that it is less than twenty cubits. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He need not</b> diminish it, since the cross beam enables one to carry in the alleyway even at that height. If the entrance to the alleyway is <b>wider than ten cubits, one must diminish</b> its width. <b>However, if</b> the entrance to the alleyway <b>has the form of a doorway,</b> i.e., two vertical posts on the two sides, and a horizontal beam spanning the space between them, <b>even if it is wider than ten cubits, he need not diminish</b> it, as it is then regarded as an entrance, rather than a breach, even if it is very wide.",
            "There is a basic dispute with regard to the method of <b>rendering an alleyway fit</b> for one to carry within it on Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Both <b>a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam</b> are required. <b>Beit Hillel say: Either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Two <b>side posts</b> are required, one on each side of the alleyway. <b>In the name of Rabbi Yishmael, one student said before Rabbi Akiva: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about an alleyway that is less than four cubits</b> wide, as they both agree <b>that</b> carrying <b>is rendered permitted by either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam. With regard to what did they disagree? It is with regard to</b> an alleyway that is <b>wider than four cubits, and up to ten</b> cubits wide; <b>as Beit Shammai say:</b> It requires both <b>a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It requires <b>either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam. Rabbi Akiva said</b> to the disciple: It is not so, as <b>they disagree</b> both <b>about this</b> case, i.e., an alleyway that is less than four cubits wide, <b>and about that</b> case, i.e., an alleyway that is between four and ten cubits wide.",
            "<b>The</b> cross <b>beam, which</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> may be used to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, must be <b>wide enough to receive</b> and hold <b>a small brick. And</b> this <b>small brick</b> is <b>half a large brick,</b> which measures <b>three handbreadths,</b> i.e., a handbreadth and a half. <b>It is sufficient that the</b> cross <b>beam will be a handbreadth in width,</b> not a handbreadth and a half, <b>enough to hold a small brick across its width.</b>",
            "And the cross beam must be <b>wide enough to hold a small brick</b> and also <b>sturdy enough to hold a small brick</b> and not collapse. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it is <b>wide</b> enough to hold the brick, <b>even though it is not sturdy</b> enough to actually support it, it is sufficient.",
            "Therefore, even if the cross beam <b>is</b> made <b>of straw or reeds, one considers it as though it were</b> made <b>of metal.</b> If the cross beam is <b>curved,</b> so that a small brick cannot rest on it, <b>one considers it as though it were straight;</b> if it is <b>round, one considers it as though it were square.</b> The following principle was stated with regard to a round cross beam: <b>Any</b> beam <b>with a circumference of three handbreadths is a handbreadth in width,</b> i.e., in diameter. ",
            "<b>The side posts</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> of with regard to rendering an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, <b>their height</b> must be at least <b>ten handbreadths, and their width and thickness</b> may be <b>any amount. Rabbi Yosei says: Their width</b> must be at least <b>three handbreadths.</b> ",
            "<b>One may construct side posts from anything, even a living creature,</b> provided that it was properly attached to the entrance of the alleyway, <b>and Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> using a living creature as a side post. The mishna continues with a similar dispute: Even a living creature <b>imparts ritual impurity</b> if it used as the <b>covering of a grave.</b> <b>But Rabbi Meir deems it pure.</b> Likewise, <b>one may write women’s bills of divorce on</b> anything, even a living creature. <b>But Rabbi Yosei HaGelili invalidates</b> a bill of divorce written on a living creature. ",
            "If <b>a caravan camped in a valley,</b> i.e., an open space not enclosed by walls, <b>and</b> the travelers <b>enclosed</b> their camp <b>with</b> partitions made of the <b>animals’ equipment,</b> e.g., saddles and the like, <b>one may carry inside</b> the enclosed area, <b>provided that</b> the resultant partition <b>will be a fence ten handbreadths high, and</b> that <b>there will not be breaches</b> in the partition <b>greater</b> than <b>the built</b> segment. <b>Any breach that is approximately ten cubits</b> wide <b>is permitted</b> and does not invalidate the partition <b>because it is</b> considered <b>like an entrance.</b> However, if one of the breaches is <b>greater than</b> ten cubits, <b>it is prohibited</b> to carry anywhere in the enclosed area.",
            "If a caravan is camped in a field, and the travelers seek to construct partitions to render the area fit for one to carry within it on Shabbat, <b>one surrounds</b> the area with <b>three ropes, one above another, and</b> a third <b>one above</b> the <b>other</b> two. One is permitted to carry within the circumscribed area <b>provided that there will not be</b> a gap of <b>three handbreadths between</b> one <b>rope and the next.</b> <b>The measure of the ropes and their</b> combined <b>thickness</b> must be <b>greater than a handbreadth, so that the entire</b> partition, consisting of three ropes and the empty spaces between them, <b>will be ten handbreadths</b> high. ",
            "Alternatively, <b>one</b> may <b>surround</b> the area <b>with boards</b> that stand upright, <b>provided that there will not be</b> a gap of <b>three handbreadths between one board and the next.</b> When the Sages issued this ruling, <b>they spoke</b> exclusively <b>of a caravan;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that a partition of this kind, which consists of only horizontal or vertical elements, is permitted exclusively in exigent circumstances. Otherwise, full-fledged partitions are required. <b>However, the Rabbis say: They spoke of a caravan</b> in the mishna <b>only</b> because they spoke <b>in the present,</b> citing the most typical case. Those traveling in caravans were typically unable to erect full-fledged partitions, so they would surround their camps with ropes or boards. However, the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna applies in all cases. The mishna cites an additional dispute: <b>Any partition that is not</b> constructed <b>of</b> both <b>warp and woof,</b> i.e., vertical and horizontal elements, <b>is not a partition;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> He holds that the vertical boards and the horizontal ropes are not considered a partition, even in the exigent circumstances of a caravan. <b>However, the Rabbis say: One of the two elements,</b> either vertical or horizontal, is sufficient. The Sages <b>exempted</b> a soldier <b>in</b> a military <b>camp</b> in <b>four matters: One may bring wood</b> for kindling <b>from any place</b> with no concern that he is stealing wood from its owners; <b>and one is exempt from</b> ritual <b>washing</b> of the <b>hands</b> before eating; <b>and</b> one is exempt <b>from</b> the separation of tithes from <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>],</b> i.e., produce purchased from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, one who is not diligent in separating tithes; <b>and</b> one is exempt <b>from establishing an <i>eiruv</i>.</b>"

            "<b>One may arrange</b> upright <b>boards [<i>passin</i>] around a well</b> in the public domain in order to permit drawing water from the well on Shabbat. A well is usually at least four handbreadths wide and ten handbreadths deep. Therefore, it is considered a private domain, and it is prohibited to draw water from it on Shabbat, as that would constitute a violation of the prohibition to carry from a private domain into a public one. The Sages therefore instituted that a virtual partition may be built in the area surrounding the well, so that the enclosed area could be considered a private domain, thus permitting use of the well and carrying of the water within the partitioned area. In this specific instance, the Sages demonstrated special leniency and did not require a proper partition to enclose the entire area. For this purpose, it suffices if there are <b>four double posts [<i>deyomadin</i>] that look like eight</b> single posts, i.e., four corner pieces, each comprised of two posts joined together at right angles; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> There must be <b>eight</b> posts that <b>look like twelve.</b> How so? There must be <b>four double posts,</b> one in each corner, with <b>four plain</b> posts, one between each pair of double posts. <b>The height</b> of the double posts must be at least <b>ten handbreadths, their width</b> must be <b>six</b> handbreadths, <b>and their thickness</b> may be even <b>a minimal amount. And between them,</b> i.e., between the posts, there may be a gap <b>the size of two teams [<i>revakot</i>] of three oxen each;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> There may be a slightly larger gap, the size of two teams <b>of four</b> oxen each, and this gap is measured with the cows being <b>tied</b> together <b>and not untied,</b> and with the minimal space necessary for <b>one</b> team to be <b>entering</b> while the other <b>one is leaving.</b>",
            "<b>It is permitted to bring</b> the posts <b>closer to the well, provided that</b> the enclosed area is large enough for <b>a cow to</b> stand with <b>its head and the majority of its</b> body <b>inside</b> the partitioned space while <b>it drinks.</b> <b>It is permitted</b> <b>to distance</b> the boards from the well and expand the enclosed area by <b>any amount,</b> i.e., as much as one wishes, <b>provided that he increases the</b> number of upright <b>boards</b> between the double posts. ",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The partitioned area may be expanded <b>up to</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> which is an area of five thousand square cubits. The Rabbis <b>said to him: They only spoke of</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> with regard to a garden or an enclosure</b> used for storing wood, scrap, and the like <b>[<i>karpef</i>]. But if it was a pen [<i>dir</i>], or a stable [<i>sahar</i>], or a backyard, or a courtyard</b> in front of the house, <b>even</b> if it had an area of <b>five <i>beit kor</i></b> or <b>even ten <i>beit kor</i>, it is permitted. And it is permitted to distance</b> the boards and expand the enclosed area <b>by any amount, provided that one increases the</b> upright <b>boards</b> between the double posts.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If the path of the public domain passes through</b> the area of the upright boards surrounding a well <b>and obstructs it, one must divert</b> the path <b>to the sides,</b> so that the public will circumvent the enclosed area; otherwise, the partition is invalid and the enclosed area cannot be regarded as a private domain. <b>And the Rabbis say: One need not</b> divert the path of the public domain, for the partition is valid even if many people pass through it. In the case of <b>a public cistern</b> containing collected water, <b>as well as a public well</b> containing spring water, <b>and</b> even <b>a private well, one may arrange</b> upright <b>boards around them</b> in order to allow one to carry in the enclosed area, as delineated above. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a private cistern,</b> there are two deficiencies: It belongs to an individual, and it does not contain spring water. Consequently, it is impossible to permit drawing from it on Shabbat by means of boards set up in the corners; rather, <b>one must construct for it a</b> proper <b>partition ten handbreadths high;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava says: One may arrange</b> upright <b>boards only for a public well. But for the others,</b> that is, a public cistern or a private well, <b>one must set up a belt,</b> i.e., a partition consisting of ropes, <b>ten handbreadths high.</b> Such an arrangement creates a proper partition based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, namely, that solid surfaces with gaps between them smaller than three handbreadths are considered joined.",
            "<b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava said:</b> With regard to <b>a garden or a <i>karpef</i>,</b> an enclosed courtyard used for storage, <b>that is</b> not more than <b>seventy cubits and a remainder,</b> a little more, as will be explained below, <b>by seventy cubits and a remainder, and is surrounded by a wall ten handbreadths high, one may carry inside it,</b> as it constitutes a proper private domain. This is <b>provided that it contains a watchman’s booth or a dwelling place, or it is near the town</b> in which its owner lives, so that he uses it and it is treated like a dwelling. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This is not necessary, for <b>even if it contains only a</b> water <b>cistern, an</b> elongated water <b>ditch, or a cave,</b> i.e., a covered pit containing water, <b>one may carry inside it,</b> as the water bestows upon it the status of a dwelling. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even if it has none of these one may carry inside it, provided that it measures</b> not more than <b>seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a remainder.</b> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If its length is greater than its breadth, even by one cubit, one may not carry inside it,</b> even though its total area does not exceed an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, because in an area that was enclosed not for the purpose of residence, carrying is only permitted if the area is perfectly square. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if its length is double its breadth, one may carry inside it,</b> and there is no need to be particular about a square shape.",
            "<b>Rabbi Elai said: I heard from Rabbi Eliezer</b> that one is permitted to carry in a garden or <i>karpef</i>, <b>even</b> if the garden <b>is</b> an area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> i.e., thirty times larger than the area of a <i>beit se’a</i>. Incidentally, he adds: <b>And I also heard from him</b> another <i>halakha</i>: If <b>one of the residents of a courtyard forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents when they established an <i>eiruv</i>, and on Shabbat he ceded ownership of his part in the courtyard to the other residents, then it <b>is prohibited for him,</b> the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>to bring in</b> objects <b>or take</b> them <b>out</b> from <b>his house</b> to the courtyard; <b>however, it is permitted to them,</b> the other residents, to bring objects from their houses to that person’s house via the courtyard, and vice versa. We do not say that the failure of one resident to join in the <i>eiruv</i> nullifies the validity of the <i>eiruv</i> for the entire courtyard. <b>And I also heard from him</b> another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that one may fulfill his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover with <i>arkablin</i>,</b> a certain bitter herb. With regard to all three rulings, <b>I circulated among all</b> of Rabbi Eliezer’s <b>disciples, seeking a colleague</b> who had also heard these matters from him, <b>but I could not find</b> one."

            "<b>One may establish a joining</b> of houses in courtyards [<i>eiruv ḥatzerot</i>] in order to permit carrying on Shabbat in a courtyard shared by two or more houses, and one may establish a joining of Shabbat borders [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] in order to extend the distance one is permitted to walk on Shabbat; <b>and</b> similarly, <b>one may merge</b> courtyards in order to permit carrying in an alleyway shared by two or more courtyards. This may be done <b>with all</b> kinds of food <b>except for water and salt,</b> as they are not considered foods and therefore may not be used for these purposes. The mishna continues with two similar principles: <b>All</b> types of food <b>may be bought with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> which must be taken to Jerusalem and used to purchase food (Deuteronomy 14:26), <b>except for water and salt.</b> Similarly, <b>one who vows that nourishment</b> is prohibited to him <b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>water and salt,</b> as they are not considered sources of nourishment. It was further stated with regard to the laws of joining courtyards that <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> <i>teḥumin</i> <b>for a nazirite with wine,</b> even though he is prohibited to drink it, because it is permitted to others. <b>And</b> similarly, one may establish an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> <b>for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>,</b> even though he may not eat it, because it is permitted to a priest. The food used for an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> must be fit for human consumption, but it is not essential that it be fit for the consumption of the one for whom it is being used. <b>Summakhos,</b> however, <b>says:</b> One may only establish an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> for an Israelite <b>with unconsecrated</b> food. It was additionally stated that one may establish an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> <b>for a priest in a <i>beit haperas</i>,</b> a field containing a grave that was plowed over. There is doubt as to the location of bone fragments in the entire area. A priest is prohibited to come into contact with a corpse, and therefore may not enter a <i>beit haperas</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> An <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> may be established for a priest <b>even between the graves</b> in a graveyard, an area which the priest may not enter by Torah law, <b>since he can interpose</b> between himself and the graves <b>and go and eat</b> the food that comprises the <i>eiruv</i> without contracting ritual impurity.",
            "<b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with <i>demai</i>,</b> produce purchased from one who may not have separated the required tithes, <b>and</b> similarly, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with</b> the <b>first tithe whose <i>teruma</i> has been taken</b> in order to be given to a priest, <b>and with</b> the <b>second tithe and consecrated articles that have been redeemed; and priests</b> may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of dough that must be given to a priest. <b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with <i>tevel</i>,</b> produce from which the priestly dues [<i>teruma</i>] and other tithes have not been separated, <b>nor with first tithe whose <i>teruma</i>,</b> which must be given to a priest, <b>has not been taken, nor with</b> the <b>second tithe or consecrated articles that have not been redeemed.</b> If <b>one sends his <i>eiruv</i> in the hands of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> all of whom are regarded as legally incompetent, <b>or in the hands of one who does not accept</b> the principle of <b><i>eiruv</i>, it is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> But <b>if one told another</b> person <b>to receive it from him</b> at a specific location and set it down in that spot, <b>it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The critical point in the establishment of an <i>eiruv</i> is that it must be deposited in the proper location by a competent person; but it is immaterial how the <i>eiruv</i> arrives there.",
            "If <b>one placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a tree above ten handbreadths</b> from the ground, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> if it is <b>below ten handbreadths, his <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> If <b>he placed</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a pit, even</b> if <b>it was a hundred cubits deep, his <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> If <b>one placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> <b>on top of a reed or on top of a pole [<i>kundas</i>], when</b> the reed or pole <b>is detached</b> from its original place <b>and stuck</b> into the ground, <b>even</b> if it is <b>a hundred cubits high, it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> as one can remove the reed or pole from the ground and take his <i>eiruv</i>. <b>If one put</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a cupboard</b> and locked it, <b>and the key was lost,</b> so that he is now unable to open the cupboard and access the <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it is</b> nonetheless a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.

            "If one’s <i>eiruv</i> <b>rolled beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> and he no longer has access to his <i>eiruv</i> since he may not go beyond his limit, or if <b>a pile</b> of stones <b>fell on it, or</b> if <b>it was burnt,</b> or if the <i>eiruv</i> was <b><i>teruma</i> and it became</b> ritually <b>impure;</b> if any of these occurrences took place <b>while it was still day,</b> prior to the onset of Shabbat, <b>it is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> since one did not have an <i>eiruv</i> at twilight, which is the time one’s Shabbat residence is established. However, if any of these occurred <b>after dark,</b> when it was already Shabbat, <b>it is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> as it was intact and accessible at the time one’s Shabbat residence is determined. <b>If</b> the matter is <b>in doubt,</b> i.e., if he does not know when one of the aforementioned incidents occurred, <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda say: This</b> person <b>is</b> in the position of both <b>a donkey driver,</b> who must prod the animal from behind, <b>and a camel driver,</b> who must lead the animal from the front, i.e., he is a person who is pulled in two opposite directions. Due to the uncertainty concerning his Shabbat border, he must act stringently, as though his resting place were both in his town and at the location where he placed the <i>eiruv</i>. He must restrict his Shabbat movement to those areas that are within two thousand cubits of both locations. <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon</b> disagree and <b>say: An <i>eiruv</i></b> whose validity is <b>in doubt is</b> nevertheless <b>valid. Rav Yosei said:</b> The Sage <b>Avtolemos testified in the name of five Elders that an <i>eiruv</i></b> whose validity is <b>in doubt is valid.</b>",
            "<b>A person may make a condition with regard to his <i>eiruv</i></b> of Shabbat borders. In other words, he need not decide in advance in which direction his <i>eiruv</i> should take effect. For example, he may deposit an <i>eiruv</i> on each of two opposite sides of his town, <b>and say: If gentiles come from the east, my <i>eiruv</i> is in the west,</b> so that I can escape in that direction; and if they come <b>from the west, my <i>eiruv</i> is in the east.

            "<b>One who finds phylacteries</b> outside the city on Shabbat, where they are in danger of becoming lost or damaged, <b>brings them in</b> to his house <b>pair</b> by <b>pair</b> by donning them in the manner in which they are typically donned for the mitzva. <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> He brings them in <b>two</b> pairs by <b>two</b> pairs. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that one is permitted to carry phylacteries inside <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to old</b> phylacteries, which have already been used and are designated for the mitzva. <b>However, with regard to new</b> ones, as it is unclear whether they are phylacteries or merely amulets in the form of phylacteries, he is <b>exempt</b> from performing the task. If <b>one finds</b> phylacteries <b>tied in bundles or in wrapped piles,</b> in which case he is unable to carry them in pairs, <b>he</b> sits there and <b>waits with them until dark,</b> guarding them until the conclusion of Shabbat, <b>and</b> then <b>brings them in</b> to his house. <b>And in</b> a time of <b>danger,</b> when it is dangerous to tarry outside town, <b>he covers</b> the phylacteries <b>and proceeds on his</b> way.",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that there is an alternative method of transferring the phylacteries: <b>One gives them to another</b> who is less than four cubits from him, <b>and the other</b> passes them <b>to another, until</b> the phylacteries <b>reach the outermost courtyard</b> of the city. Since carrying less than four cubits in a public domain is not prohibited by Torah law, in this case, the Sages permitted carrying in that manner due to the sanctity of the phylacteries. <b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one’s son</b> who was born in a field and may not be carried on Shabbat, since that is akin to carrying a burden in the public domain: <b>One gives him to another, and the other</b> passes him <b>to another, even</b> if it requires <b>a hundred</b> people. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> may even <b>give a barrel to another, and the other</b> may pass it <b>to another,</b> and in that way <b>even</b> take it <b>beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> provided that no one person carries it more than four cubits. <b>They said to him: This</b> barrel may <b>not go a greater</b> distance <b>than the feet of its owner,</b> i.e., it may not be carried any farther than its owner may walk.",
            "One who <b>was reading</b> a sacred <b>book</b> in scroll form on Shabbat <b>on</b> an elevated, wide <b>threshold, and the book rolled from his hand</b> into the public domain, <b>he</b> may <b>roll it</b> back <b>to himself,</b> since one of its ends remains in his hand.

In that case, <b>he</b> may only <b>turn it</b> over <b>onto the</b> side with <b>writing,</b> so that the writing of the book will be facedown and not exposed and degraded. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if the scroll <b>is removed only a needle breadth from the ground, he rolls it</b> back <b>to himself.

And</b> restoring <b>the upper</b> hinge pin <b>is prohibited in both</b> places, as this is considered building, a labor prohibited by Torah law, which applies everywhere. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Restoring <b>the upper</b> hinge pin to its place is permitted <b>in the Temple, while</b> one may restore <b>the lower one</b> to its place even <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country.</b>",

If</b> one sought to apply the bandage <b>for the first time</b> to an untreated wound on Shabbat, <b>it is prohibited in both</b> places. <b>One</b> may <b>tie up</b> on Shabbat <b>a string [<i>nima</i>]</b> that came loose from a harp used <b>in the Temple, but not in</b> the rest of <b>the country.

            "With regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> of one of the eight species of reptile or rodent listed in Leviticus 11:29–30, one of the primary sources of ritual impurity <b>that is found in the Temple, a priest</b> should <b>carry it out</b> on Shabbat <b>in his girdle,</b> which was one of the priestly garments. Although the girdle will be defiled by the carcass of the creeping animal, this is the best way to proceed, <b>so as not to delay</b> the removal of <b>the impurity</b> from the Temple. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The creeping animal carcass should be removed <b>with wooden prongs, so as not to increase the impurity,</b> as a wooden prong is not susceptible to impurity. It is obvious that on a weekday the creeping animal carcass is removed from wherever it is found in the Temple, but <b>from where does one remove it</b> on Shabbat? <b>From the Sanctuary, from the Entrance Hall, and from</b> the area in the courtyard <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar,</b> the most sanctified precincts of the Temple. However, it need not be removed from the rest of the courtyard. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas.</b> <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Any place where one is liable to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i></b> if he <b>intentionally</b> enters there in a state of ritual impurity, <b>and</b> is liable to bring a <b>sin-offering</b> if he does so <b>unwittingly, from there one</b> must <b>remove it.</b> This includes the entire area of the Temple courtyard. <b>And</b> as for <b>the rest of the places</b> in the Temple, <b>one covers</b> the creeping animal carcass <b>with a bowl [<i>pesakhter</i>]</b> and leaves it there until the conclusion of Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that this is the principle: <b>Wherever the Sages permitted</b> something <b>to you, they granted you</b> only <b>from your own, as they permitted to you only</b> activities that are prohibited <b>due to rabbinic decree,</b> not labors prohibited by Torah law."
