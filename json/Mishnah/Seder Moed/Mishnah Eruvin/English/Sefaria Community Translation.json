Said Rabban Gamliel, \"It happened that a Sadducee dwelt with us in a mavoy [an alleyway onto which courtyards open] in Jerusalem; and father said to us [on the Shabbat eve], 'Hurry and take out all the vessels into the mavoy, before [the Sadducee] brings out [his], and [by so doing] forbids it to you [to carry there].'\" Rabbi Yehudah says [it] with a variation in the language: \"Hurry and do [take care of] your needs in the mavoy, before [the Shabbat] comes out, and [thus] forbids it to you [to carry there, as it is now muktzeh].'\""
