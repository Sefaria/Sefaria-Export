            "<b>Seven days prior to Yom Kippur</b> the Sages would <b>remove the High Priest,</b> who performs the entire Yom Kippur service, <b>from his house to the Chamber of <i>Parhedrin</i>,</b> a room in the Temple designated specifically for the High Priest during that period. <b>And they would designate another priest in his stead</b> to replace him <b>lest a disqualification</b> due to impurity or another circumstance beyond his control prevent him from entering the Temple on Yom Kippur. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Sages would <b>even designate another wife for him lest his wife die, as it is stated</b> in the Torah portion of the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And it will atone for him and for his house”</b> (Leviticus 16:6); the Sages interpreted the term: <b>His house, that is his wife.</b> The priest must be married in order to fulfill this commandment. Due to the concern lest his wife die, another wife was designated to address that possibility. <b>The Rabbis said</b> to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>If so,</b> that this is a concern, <b>there is no end to the matter,</b> as what if the designated replacement wife dies? This possibility need not be a source of concern.",
            "During <b>all seven days</b> of the High Priest’s sequestering before Yom Kippur, <b>he sprinkles the blood</b> of the daily burnt-offering, <b>and he burns the incense, and he removes</b> the ashes of <b>the lamps</b> of the candelabrum, <b>and he sacrifices the head and the</b> hind <b>leg</b> of the daily offering. The High Priest performs these tasks in order to grow accustomed to the services that he will perform on Yom Kippur. <b>On all the other days</b> of the year, <b>if</b> the High Priest <b>wishes to sacrifice</b> any of the offerings, <b>he sacrifices them, as the High Priest sacrifices</b> any <b>portion</b> that he chooses <b>first and takes</b> any <b>portion</b> that he chooses <b>first.</b>",
            "The Sages <b>provided</b> the High Priest <b>with Elders</b> selected <b>from the Elders of the court, and they</b> would <b>read before him the order</b> of the service <b>of the day</b> of Yom Kippur. <b>And they</b> would <b>say to him: My Master, High Priest. Read</b> the order of the service <b>with your own mouth,</b> as <b>perhaps you forgot</b> this reading <b>or perhaps you did not learn</b> to read. <b>On Yom Kippur eve</b> in the <b>morning,</b> the Elders <b>stand him at</b> the <b>eastern gate</b> of the courtyard <b>and pass before him bulls and rams and sheep so that he will be familiar</b> with the animals <b>and</b> grow <b>accustomed to the service,</b> as these were the animals sacrificed on Yom Kippur.",
            "Throughout <b>all the seven days</b> that the High Priest was in the <i>Parhedrin</i> chamber, <b>they would not withhold from him</b> any <b>food or drink</b> that he desired. However, <b>on Yom Kippur eve at nightfall, they would not allow him to eat a great deal because food induces sleep</b> and they did not allow him to sleep, as will be explained.",
            "<b>The Elders of the court</b> who read the order of the service of the day before the High Priest <b>passed him to the Elders of the priesthood, and they took him up to the House of Avtinas. And they administered him an oath and took leave</b> of him <b>and went on their way.</b> When they administered this oath <b>they said to him: My Master, High Priest. We are agents of the court, and you are our agent and the agent of the court. We administer an oath to you in</b> the name of <b>Him who housed His name in this House, that you will not change</b> even one <b>matter from all that we have said to you</b> with regard to the burning of the incense or any other service that you will perform when alone. After this oath, <b>he would leave</b> them <b>and cry, and they would leave</b> him <b>and cry</b> in sorrow that the oath was necessary.",
            "They kept him occupied throughout the night to prevent him from sleeping. <b>If he was a scholar, he</b> would <b>teach</b> Torah. <b>If</b> he was <b>not</b> a scholar, <b>Torah scholars</b> would <b>teach</b> Torah <b>before him. And if</b> he was <b>accustomed to read</b> the Bible, <b>he</b> would <b>read; and if</b> he was <b>not, they</b> would <b>read</b> the Bible <b>before him. And what</b> books would <b>they read before him</b> to pique his interest so that he would not fall asleep? They would read <b>from Job, and from Ezra, and from Chronicles. Zekharya, son of Kevutal, says: Many times I read before him from</b> the book of <b>Daniel.</b>",
            " If the High Priest <b>sought to sleep</b> at night, <b>the young priests</b> would <b>snap the middle [<i>tzerada</i>] finger</b> against the thumb <b>before him, and they</b> would <b>say to him</b> every so often: <b>My Master, High Priest. Stand</b> from your bed <b>and chill</b> yourself <b>once on the floor</b> and overcome your drowsiness. <b>And they</b> would <b>engage him</b> in various ways <b>until the time would arrive to slaughter the</b> daily offering.",
            "<b>Every day</b> the priests <b>would remove</b> the ashes <b>from the altar</b> and place them on the east side of the ramp <b>at the crow of the rooster or adjacent to it, whether before it or after it,</b> as there was no insistence on a precise time. <b>And on Yom Kippur</b> they would remove the ashes earlier, <b>from midnight</b> onward. <b>And on the Festivals,</b> the ashes were removed even earlier, at the end of <b>the first watch. And the call of the rooster would not arrive</b> on Festivals <b>until the</b> Temple <b>courtyard was full with the Jewish people</b> who vowed to bring offerings and would fulfill their obligations on the Festivals. Those offerings were sacrificed immediately following the daily offering."
        ],
        [
            "<b>Initially,</b> the practice among the priests was that <b>whoever wishes to remove</b> the ashes from <b>the altar removes them. And when there are many</b> priests who wish to perform that task, the privilege to do so is determined by a race: The priests <b>run and ascend on the ramp</b> leading to the top of the altar. <b>Any</b> priest <b>who precedes another</b> and reaches within <b>four cubits</b> of the top of the altar first <b>is privileged</b> to remove the ashes. <b>And if both of them were equal</b> and neither preceded the other, <b>the appointed</b> priest says to all the priests: <b>Extend</b> your <b>fingers,</b> and a lottery was performed, as will be explained. <b>And what</b> fingers <b>do they extend</b> for the lottery? They may extend <b>one or two</b> fingers, <b>and</b> the priests <b>do not extend a thumb in the Temple.</b> The reason is that the lottery was conducted by the appointee choosing a number and counting the extended fingers of the priests standing in a circle. As the count progressed, a priest could calculate and manipulate the result in his favor by surreptitiously extending his thumb and an additional finger. Since there is separation between the thumb and the forefinger it could appear as though they belonged to two different priests, skewing the results of the lottery.",
            "Initially, that was the procedure; however, <b>an incident</b> occurred <b>where both of them were equal</b> as they were <b>running and ascending on the ramp, and one of them shoved another and he fell and his leg was broken. And once the court saw that</b> people <b>were coming to</b> potential <b>danger, they instituted that</b> priests <b>would remove</b> ashes from <b>the altar only</b> by means <b>of a lottery. There were four lotteries there,</b> in the Temple, on a daily basis to determine the priests privileged to perform the various services, <b>and this,</b> determining which priest would remove the ashes, was <b>the first lottery.</b>",
            "<b>The second lottery</b> conducted daily among the priests determines the following: <b>Who slaughters</b> the daily morning offering, <b>who sprinkles</b> its blood, <b>who removes the ashes</b> from <b>the inner altar, and who removes the ashes</b> and burnt wicks from <b>the candelabrum, and who takes the limbs</b> of the daily offering <b>up to the ramp</b> to be burned later. This is how the limbs were divided before taking them up to the altar: <b>The head and the</b> right <b>leg</b> were carried by one priest, <b>and the two forelegs</b> were carried by a second priest. <b>The tail,</b> including the lower vertebrae of the spinal column and the fat tail, <b>and the</b> left <b>leg</b> were carried by a third priest. <b>And the breast and the throat</b> and some of the inner organs attached to it were carried by a fourth priest. <b>And the two flanks</b> were taken by a fifth priest, <b>and the intestines</b> by a sixth priest. <b>And the fine flour</b> of the meal-offering accompanying the daily offering was carried by a seventh priest. <b>And the</b> High Priest’s daily <b>griddle-cake offering</b> was carried by an eighth priest, <b>and the wine</b> for libation was carried by a ninth priest. Altogether <b>thirteen priests prevailed in this</b> lottery: Nine priests who carried the daily offering and its accompanying elements, and four who performed the slaughter, sprinkling, and removal of ashes from the inner altar and the candelabrum. <b>Ben Azzai said before Rabbi Akiva in the name of RabbiYehoshua:</b> That was not the sequence of taking the limbs up to the ramp; rather, the order in which <b>it was sacrificed</b> was according to <b>the way it walks</b> when alive, as will be explained in the Gemara.",
            "Before <b>the third lottery,</b> the appointee declared: Let only those priests who are <b>new to</b> offering <b>the incense</b> come and <b>participate in the lottery</b> for the incense. <b>The fourth</b> lottery was open to those <b>new</b> to the service along <b>with</b> those <b>old</b> hands who had already performed it,to determine <b>who</b> would <b>take the limbs up from the ramp,</b> where they had been placed earlier, <b>to the altar.</b>",
            "The <b>daily offering is sacrificed</b> and its limbs are carried <b>by nine</b> priests, as mentioned in a previous mishna. These nine carry the limbs and the accompanying libations and meal-offerings. Occasionally, the service is performed <b>by ten</b> priests, occasionally <b>by eleven,</b> and sometimes <b>by twelve</b> priests; <b>no fewer</b> than nine <b>and no more</b> than twelve. <b>How so?</b> The daily offering <b>itself</b> is sacrificed <b>by nine</b> priests, as explained earlier. <b>On the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> a priest <b>in</b> whose <b>hand</b> is <b>a jug of water</b> for the water libation is added, and <b>there are ten</b> priests. On <i>Sukkot</i>, a water libation is poured on the altar in addition to the standard wine libation. <b>In the</b> daily <b>afternoon</b> offering, <b>eleven</b> priests participate in the service. How so? The daily offering <b>itself</b> is sacrificed <b>by nine, and</b> there are an additional <b>two</b> priests <b>in whose hands</b> are <b>two logs</b> that are placed on the altar. The mitzva of placing the two logs in the morning was assigned in the first lottery, as the Gemara explained earlier. <b>On Shabbat, eleven</b> priests participate. How so? The daily morning offering <b>itself</b> is performed <b>by nine, and</b> there are an additional <b>two</b> priests <b>in whose hands</b> are <b>two vessels of frankincense</b> that accompany <b>the shewbread.</b> This frankincense is burned on Shabbat. <b>And on Shabbat that</b> occurs <b>within the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> there is an additional priest <b>in whose hand</b> is a <b>jug of water</b> for the water libation, for a total of twelve priests.",
            "<b>A ram</b> that is brought for a communal burnt-offering <b>is sacrificed by eleven</b> priests. <b>The flesh</b> on the various limbs is taken <b>by five</b> priests, as in the case of the sheep of the daily offering. <b>The intestines, and the fine flour</b> of the meal-offering, <b>and the wine</b> of the libation are carried by <b>two</b> priests <b>each,</b> because the meal-offering and wine libation that accompany a ram are larger than those that accompany a sheep.",
            " <b>A bull</b> is <b>sacrificed by twenty-four</b> priests. How so? <b>The head and the</b> right <b>leg</b> are sacrificed first, but due to its size <b>the head</b> is carried <b>by one</b> priest <b>and the leg by two. The tail and the</b> left <b>leg</b> are carried as follows: <b>The tail</b> is sacrificed <b>by two and the leg by two. The breast and the neck</b> are carried as follows: <b>The breast</b> is offered <b>by one and the neck by three</b> priests. The <b>two forelegs</b> are carried <b>by two</b> priests, <b>and the two flanks</b> are carried <b>by two. The intestines and the fine flour and the wine</b> are carried <b>by three each,</b> because the meal-offering and wine libation that accompany a bull are larger than those that accompany a ram. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that this is the sequence followed? It is <b>in</b> the case of <b>communal offerings. However, in</b> the case of <b>an individual offering</b> brought to fulfill a vow or an obligation, <b>if</b> a single priest <b>wishes to sacrifice</b> it alone <b>he</b> may <b>sacrifice</b> it alone, or if he chooses he may include other priests in the service. With regard to <b>the flaying and the cutting of</b> both <b>these,</b> individual offerings, and <b>those,</b> communal offerings, <b>they are equal,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara."

            "<b>The appointed</b> priest <b>said to</b> the other priests: <b>Go out and observe if</b> it is day and <b>the time for slaughter</b> has <b>arrived. If</b> the time has <b>arrived, the observer says: There is light [<i>barkai</i>]. Matya ben Shmuel says</b> that the appointed priest phrased his question differently: <b>Is the entire eastern sky illuminated even to Hebron? And</b> the observer <b>says: Yes.</b>",
            " And why did they need to ascertain whether or not it is day, which is typically evident to all? It was necessary, <b>as once, the light of the moon rose, and they imagined that the eastern</b> sky <b>was illuminated</b> with sunlight, <b>and they slaughtered the daily offering</b> before its appropriate time. The animal was later <b>taken out to the place</b> designated for <b>burning</b> and burned because it was slaughtered too early. In order to prevent similar errors in the future, the Sages instituted that they would carefully assess the situation until they were certain that it was day. After the priests announced the start of the day, <b>they led the High Priest down to the Hall of Immersion.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This was the principle in the Temple: Anyone who covers his legs,</b> a euphemism for defecating, <b>requires immersion</b> afterward; <b>and anyone who urinates requires sanctification of the hands and feet</b> with water from the basin afterward. ",
            "<b>A person does not enter the</b> Temple <b>courtyard for the</b> Temple <b>service, even</b> if he is <b>pure, until he immerses.

",
            "<b>They spread a sheet of fine linen between him and the people</b> in the interest of modesty, and then the High Priest immersed and <b>sanctified his hands and feet.</b> The High Priest <b>removed</b> the white garments that he was wearing, <b>descended</b> to the ritual bath, <b>and immersed. He ascended and dried himself</b> with a towel. Then <b>they brought him</b> the <b>golden garments</b> of the High Priest, <b>and he dressed</b> in the garments, and <b>he sanctified his hands and his feet. They brought him the</b> sheep for <b>the daily</b> morning <b>offering, which he slaughtered</b> by cutting most of the way through the gullet and the windpipe. <b>And a different</b> priest <b>completed</b> the <b>slaughter on his behalf</b> so that the High Priest could receive the blood in a vessel and proceed with the order of the Yom Kippur service. As soon as the slaughter was completed, the High Priest <b>received the blood</b> in a vessel <b>and sprinkled it</b> on the altar. <b>He entered</b> the Sanctuary <b>to burn the morning incense and to remove</b> the ashes from <b>the lamps</b> of the candelabrum; <b>and</b> he left the Sanctuary and returned to the courtyard <b>to sacrifice the head and the limbs</b> of the sheep sacrificed for the daily offering <b>and the</b> High Priest’s daily <b>griddle-cake</b> offering, <b>and the wine</b> libation of the daily offering. ",
            "The Mishna comments: <b>The morning incense was burned between</b> the receiving and sprinkling of the <b>blood</b> and the burning <b>of the limbs;</b> and the <b>afternoon</b> incense was burned <b>between</b> the taking of the <b>limbs</b> up to the altar and the pouring of the <b>libations</b> that accompanied the offering. With regard to the immersion, <b>if the High Priest was old</b> and found it difficult to immerse in cold water, <b>or</b> if he was <b>delicate [<i>istenis</i>], they</b> would <b>heat hot</b> water <b>for him</b> on Yom Kippur eve <b>and place</b> it <b>into the cold</b> water of the ritual bath <b>in order to temper its chill</b> so the High Priest could immerse without discomfort. ",
            "<b>They brought</b> the High Priest to immerse a second time in the <b>Hall of <i>Parva</i>,</b> which <b>was in the sacred</b> area, the Temple courtyard. <b>They spread a sheet of fine linen between him and the people</b> in the interest of modesty. <b>And he sanctified his hands and his feet and removed</b> his garments. <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that this was the sequence: He first <b>removed</b> his garments and then <b>he sanctified his hands and his feet. He descended and immersed</b> a second time. <b>He ascended and dried himself.</b> And <b>they</b> immediately <b>brought him</b> the <b>white garments,</b> in which <b>he dressed, and he sanctified his hands and his feet.</b> ",
            "<b>In the morning he would wear</b> linen garments <b>from</b> the Egyptian city of <b>Pelusium worth twelve <i>maneh</i>,</b> 1,200 dinars or <i>zuz</i>.

By immersing the basin in flowing water, the water inside remained fit for use the next morning. <b>King Munbaz would</b> contribute the funds required to <b>make the handles of all the Yom Kippur vessels of gold.</b> Queen <b>Helene, his mother, fashioned a</b> decorative <b>gold chandelier above the entrance of the Sanctuary.

For <b>transgressions between a person and God, Yom Kippur atones;</b> however, for <b>transgressions between a person and another, Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases</b> the <b>other</b> person. In conclusion, <b>Rabbi Akiva said: How fortunate are you, Israel; before Whom are you purified, and Who purifies you?</b> It is <b>your Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “And I will sprinkle purifying water upon you, and you shall be purified”</b> (Ezekiel 36:25). <b>And it says: “The ritual bath of Israel is God”</b> (Jeremiah 17:13). <b>Just as a ritual bath purifies the impure, so too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, purifies Israel.</b>"
