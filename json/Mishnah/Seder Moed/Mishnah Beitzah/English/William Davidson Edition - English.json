            "With regard to <b>an egg that was laid on a Festival</b> (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:1), <b>Beit Shammai say: It may be eaten</b> even on that day, <b>and Beit Hillel say: It may not be eaten,</b> as the Gemara will explain at length. Apropos this exceptional case, in which Beit Shammai are lenient and Beit Hillel are strict, the mishna cites additional <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals in which this unusual phenomenon occurs (<i>Yoma</i> 79b). <b>Beit Shammai say: Leaven,</b> i.e., dough that has leavened to such an extent that it is no longer used as food but as a leavening agent for other dough, is prohibited on Passover in the measure <b>of an olive-bulk.</b> However, the measure for edible <b>leavened bread</b> is greater, that <b>of a large date-bulk. And Beit Hillel say:</b> For both <b>this and that,</b> the measure is that <b>of an olive-bulk.</b>",
            "Furthermore, with regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival</b> (<i>Eduyyot</i> 4:2), in which case there is a mitzva from the Torah to cover the blood after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13), <b>Beit Shammai say: He digs</b> earth <b>with a shovel and covers</b> the blood with that earth <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may not slaughter</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>unless he had earth prepared</b> for that purpose <b>while it was still day. But</b> even Beit Hillel <b>concede that if one</b> already <b>slaughtered</b> the animal or the bird, <b>then he should dig with a shovel and cover</b> the blood. Additionally, they agree <b>that the ashes of a stove are</b> considered <b>prepared</b> for the use of covering blood, as will be explained by the Gemara.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: One may not carry a ladder,</b> which was used for reaching doves, <b>from one dovecote to another. However,</b> one may move it slightly so that <b>he tilts it from one window to another</b> in the same dovecote. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> even carrying a ladder from one dovecote to another. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not take</b> fledgling doves from a dovecote on a Festival, <b>unless he shook</b> the ones he wished to take <b>while it was still day,</b> thereby preparing them. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is not necessary to shake; rather, it is sufficient if one <b>stands</b> the day before <b>and says: I</b> will <b>take this</b> fledgling <b>and that</b> one.",
            "If, on the eve of a Festival, one <b>designated black</b> fledglings to be slaughtered, <b>and</b> on the following day <b>found white</b> ones in the dovecote, rather than the birds he had designated, or if one designated <b>white</b> ones to be slaughtered <b>and found black</b> ones, or if one designated <b>two</b> fledglings to be slaughtered <b>and found three, they are prohibited,</b> as these are not the same fledglings he had designated earlier. If, however, one designated <b>three</b> to be slaughtered <b>and found</b> only <b>two, they are permitted,</b> as it is presumed that one of the fledglings escaped. If one designated them <b>inside the nest</b> and the next day he cannot find them there, <b>and he found</b> fledglings <b>before the nest, they are prohibited,</b> as they might be fledglings other than the ones he designated and left inside the nest. <b>But if there are only those</b> fledglings in the immediate vicinity, <b>they are permitted,</b> as it can be assumed that these are the ones he designated inside the nest.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: One may not remove</b> the <b>shutters [<i>terisin</i>]</b> of a store <b>on a Festival,</b> due to the prohibition against building and demolishing. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> one not only to open the shutters, but <b>even to replace</b> them. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not take a large pestle</b> from a mortar, which is normally used for crushing wheat in the preparation of porridge, for any other purpose on a Festival, e.g., <b>to cut meat on it; and Beit Hillel permit</b> it. Likewise, <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not place</b> an unprocessed <b>hide before those who</b> will <b>tread on it,</b> as this constitutes the prohibited labor of tanning on a Festival. <b>And one may not lift</b> the hide from its place, as it is considered <i>muktze</i>, <b>unless there is an olive-bulk of meat on it,</b> in which case it may be carried on account of its meat; <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> it in both cases. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may carry out</b> on a Festival <b>neither a minor</b> child, <b>nor a <i>lulav</i>, nor a Torah Scroll into the public domain,</b> as none of these are required for the preparation of food; <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> it.",
            "The separation of <i>ḥalla</i> is permitted on a Festival, as one is permitted to prepare dough and bake it on a Festival, and bread may not be eaten without first separating <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not bring</b> separated <b><i>ḥalla</i> or</b> any of the other priestly <b>gifts,</b> i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw of a slaughtered animal, <b>to a priest on a Festival,</b> though it is permitted to separate them from an animal slaughtered on a Festival. This is prohibited regardless of <b>whether they were separated last evening,</b> i.e., before the Festival, <b>or whether they were separated today. And Beit Hillel permit</b> it. <b>Beit Shammai said to</b> Beit Hillel: This <i>halakha</i> can be derived by <b>an analogy: <i>Ḥalla</i> and</b> the other <b>gifts</b> are both considered <b>a gift to the priest, and</b> likewise <b><i>teruma</i></b> separated from produce is also <b>a gift to the priest. Just as</b> you agree <b>that one may not bring <i>teruma</i></b> to a priest on a Festival, <b>so too, one may not bring the</b> other <b>gifts.</b> <b>Beit Hillel said to them: No,</b> this analogy is incorrect. <b>If you said</b> that you derive the halakha from <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> where <b>its separation is not allowed</b> on the Festival, how <b>will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to the gifts</b> from an animal or <i>ḥalla</i>, concerning <b>which their separation is allowed</b> on the Festival? Since it is not prohibited to separate these gifts, they may likewise be brought to a priest.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: Spices may be pounded</b> on a Festival in a slightly unusual manner, <b>with a wooden pestle, and salt</b> may be pounded only <b>with</b> an earthenware <b>flask or with a wooden pot ladle,</b> in a manner very different from that of a weekday. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Spices may be pounded in their</b> usual <b>manner,</b> even <b>with a stone pestle, and</b> as for <b>salt,</b> although it must be pounded in an irregular manner, a slight modification such as pounding it <b>with a wooden pestle</b> is enough to render the act permitted.",
            "With regard to <b>one who selects legumes on a Festival</b> by separating the edible and inedible portions, <b>Beit Shammai say: He may select food and eat</b> it immediately, while leaving the refuse. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may select in his</b> usual <b>manner, in his lap, with a tray, or with a large vessel, but he may not</b> do so <b>with a tablet, nor with a winnow, nor with a sieve,</b> as these vessels are specially designed for selecting, which gives his action the appearance of a weekday activity. <b>Rabban Gamliel says: One may even wash</b> the legumes in water <b>and skim off</b> the refuse floating on top.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: One may send only portions</b> of prepared food <b>on a Festival,</b> but not any other gifts. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may</b> even <b>send</b> gifts of <b>domesticated animals, undomesticated animals, and fowl, whether alive or slaughtered.</b> Similarly, <b>one may send wines, oils, and</b> vessels of <b>flour, and</b> even <b>legumes, but not grain,</b> which is unfit for use, as one may not grind it on the Festival. <b>And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> sending gifts even in the case <b>of grain,</b> as it can be made into porridge without being ground.",
            "<b>One may send clothes, whether</b> they are <b>sewn or whether they are unsewn, and even if they contain diverse kinds,</b> a prohibited mixture of wool and linen [<i>sha’atnez</i>]. <b>But</b> one may do so only if <b>they</b> serve <b>the purposes of the Festival. However, one may not</b> send <b>a spiked sandal,</b> which has nails fixed to it, as the Sages decreed that one may not wear a sandal of this kind on a Shabbat or Festival, <b>nor an unsewn shoe,</b> which is not suitable for a Festival. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even</b> send <b>a white shoe,</b> which people do not usually wear, <b>because</b> it <b>requires an artisan</b> to paint it black. <b>This is the</b> general <b>principle:</b> Anything <b>that one may use on a Festival, one may send it.</b>"

            "With regard to <b>a Festival that occurs</b> on <b>Shabbat eve, one may not cook on the Festival with the initial</b> intent to cook <b>for Shabbat. However, he may cook</b> on that day <b>for the Festival</b> itself, <b>and if he left over</b> any food, <b>he left</b> it <b>over for Shabbat.</b> The early Sages also instituted an ordinance: The joining of cooked foods [<i>eiruv tavshilin</i>], which the mishna explains. <b>One may prepare a cooked dish</b> designated for Shabbat <b>on a Festival eve and rely on it</b> to cook on the Festival <b>for Shabbat.</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed with regard to the details of this ordinance: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> For the purpose of the joining of cooked foods one must prepare <b>two cooked dishes, and Beit Hillel say: One dish</b> is sufficient. <b>And they</b> both <b>agree with regard to a fish and</b> the <b>egg that is</b> fried <b>on it that these are</b> considered <b>two dishes</b> for this purpose. If <b>one ate</b> the food prepared before the Festival as an <i>eiruv</i> and none of it remained for Shabbat, <b>or if it was lost, he may not</b> rely <b>on it</b> and <b>cook with the initial</b> intent to cook for Shabbat. <b>If he left any part of</b> the <i>eiruv</i>, he may <b>rely on it</b> to cook <b>for Shabbat.</b>",
            "If a Festival <b>occurs</b> directly <b>after Shabbat,</b> i.e., on a Sunday, and one wishes to behave in a proper manner and purify himself and his vessels in honor of the Festival, <b>Beit Shammai say: One must immerse everything before Shabbat, and Beit Hillel say: Vessels</b> must be immersed <b>before Shabbat, but a person</b> may immerse himself even <b>on Shabbat.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel both <b>agree that one may bring</b> ritually impure <b>water into contact</b> with ritually pure water <b>in stone vessels</b> on Shabbat <b>in order to purify</b> the water. Impure water can be purified if it is placed into a vessel that does not contract ritual impurity, such as a stone vessel, and then lowered with the vessel into a ritual bath. The water becomes purified when it comes into contact with the water of the ritual bath. Although this is not considered proper immersion, water may nevertheless be purified in this manner. <b>However, one may not immerse</b> the impure water in a ritually impure vessel in order to purify the vessel at the same time. Likewise, <b>one may immerse</b> on a Festival <b>from</b> one <b>principle to another, and from one group to another,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: One may bring peace-offerings</b> on a Festival, <b>but one may not place</b> his <b>hands on them,</b> as this is considered using animals, which is prohibited on a Festival by rabbinic decree. <b>However, one may not</b> bring <b>burnt-offerings,</b> apart from the obligatory daily and additional offerings of the day, because burnt-offerings are consumed entirely on the altar and not by people, and slaughter is permitted on a Festival only for the purpose of human consumption. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may bring</b> both <b>peace-offerings and burnt-offerings, and one may</b> even <b>place</b> his <b>hands on them.</b>",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: A person may not heat water</b> on a Festival in order <b>to</b> wash <b>his feet unless it is</b> also <b>fit for drinking,</b> as they hold that kindling a fire on a Festival is permitted only for the sake of preparing food, but not for washing. <b>But Beit Hillel permit</b> one to kindle a fire on a Festival even for washing. <b>A person may kindle</b> a large <b>fire and warm himself at it.</b>",
            "<b>Rabban Gamliel was stringent</b> about <b>three things in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai: One may not insulate hot food on a Festival</b> for Shabbat <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> but rather one ought to do so on the eve of the Festival; <b>and one may not set up</b> a metal <b>candelabrum</b> that fell <b>on a Festival; and one may not bake thick loaves</b> on a Festival <b>but only thin ones,</b> due to the great effort entailed in preparing the former. <b>Rabban Gamliel said: From the days of my father’s household they would never bake thick loaves</b> on a Festival, <b>but</b> only <b>thin ones.</b> The Sages <b>said to him: What shall we do for your father’s household, who were stringent with themselves</b> but <b>lenient with all of the Jewish people, to</b> allow them to <b>bake thick loaves and cakes baked on coals.</b>",
            "Rabban Gamliel <b>also said three things as leniencies,</b> in opposition to the view of most of the Sages: <b>One may sweep the room of the couches</b> on a Festival, i.e., the dining room, where they would recline on couches to eat, as there is no concern that by sweeping the room one might come to fill in the holes and level the ground. <b>And one may place incense</b> consisting of fragrant herbs on burning coals in order to perfume one’s house <b>on a Festival. And one may prepare a whole kid</b> goat, meaning a kid goat roasted whole, with its entrails over its head, <b>on the night of Passover,</b> as was the custom when they roasted the Paschal lamb in the Temple. However, <b>the Rabbis prohibit</b> all three practices: It is prohibited to sweep lest one come to level the ground, it is prohibited to burn incense because it does not meet the criteria of permitted food preparation, and it is prohibited to eat a kid that was roasted whole on the night of Passover because it would appear as if he were eating consecrated food outside the Temple.",
            "There are <b>three things</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya permits and the Rabbis prohibit: His cow</b> would <b>go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with</b> a decorative <b>strap between its horns.</b> Rabbi Elazar holds that such a strap is considered an ornament for the cow rather than a burden, whereas the Sages view it as a burden. <b>And one may comb [<i>mekardin</i>] an animal</b> with a fine comb <b>on a Festival</b> in order to remove ticks and dirt from its hair; the Rabbis prohibit this due to a concern that he might thereby come to wound or bruise the animal. <b>And one may grind pepper</b> needed on the Festival even <b>in its</b> own <b>mill,</b> although this appears similar to a weekday labor. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not comb an animal</b> to remove ticks and dirt from its hair <b>on a Festival because</b> this certainly <b>creates a wound, but one may brush</b> it with a wooden comb, as its blunt teeth do not wound the animal. <b>But the Rabbis say: One may not comb, nor may one even brush.</b>",
            "<b>The</b> aforementioned <b>pepper mill</b> is a composite vessel, and each of its parts must be considered independently with respect to ritual impurity. It <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity because of</b> each of the <b>three vessels</b> of which it is comprised: It is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is a wooden <b>receptacle,</b> it is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a metal vessel, and</b> it is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a sieve.</b>",
            "<b>A child’s wagon,</b> with which he plays and upon which he also sits, <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b> It is considered a fixed seat of the child, so that if the child is a <i>zav</i> and he sits on the wagon, it contracts the ritual impurity imparted by the treading of a <i>zav</i>. <b>And</b> this wagon <b>may be handled on Shabbat,</b> as it is considered a vessel. <b>And it may be dragged</b> on the ground on Shabbat <b>only upon cloth,</b> a stone pavement, or the like, as otherwise it would create a furrow when dragged, and one would be liable due to the prohibited labor of plowing. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> For this reason, <b>no vessels may be dragged</b> on the ground on Shabbat <b>except for a wagon,</b> which is permitted <b>because</b> its wheels do not make a furrow in the ground but merely <b>press</b> the earth down. Since no earth is moved from its place, this is not considered digging or plowing on Shabbat."

            "<b>One may not trap fish from</b> their <b>ponds on a Festival</b> even with the intention of eating them, as this falls into the category of hunting, a type of labor that is not permitted on a Festival. <b>Nor may one place food before them,</b> as it is not his duty to feed them; rather, they maintain themselves by eating smaller fish or different types of algae that grow in the water. <b>However, one may trap an animal or a bird from</b> their <b>enclosures [<i>beivarim</i>],</b> as they are viewed as already captured, and therefore the action is not considered an act of hunting. <b>And one may</b> also <b>place food before them</b> as one does for other household animals. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all enclosures are identical</b> with respect to the <i>halakhot</i> of hunting. <b>This is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> animal inside such an enclosure <b>whose trapping is inadequate,</b> meaning that the enclosure is large and contains hiding places so that it is still necessary to pursue and apprehend the animal, it <b>is prohibited</b> for one to catch it; <b>and</b> with regard to any animal <b>whose trapping is not inadequate,</b> as it is possible to seize it immediately without having to engage in further pursuit, it <b>is permitted</b> for one to catch it.",
            "If <b>traps for animals, birds, and fish were set on the eve of a Festival, one may not take</b> anything <b>from them on the Festival, unless he knows that</b> the animals found in the traps <b>had</b> already <b>been caught on the eve of the Festival. And an incident</b> is related <b>where a certain gentile brought fish to Rabban Gamliel, and</b> the latter <b>said:</b> The fish <b>are permitted, but I do not wish to accept</b> them <b>from him,</b> as I despise him.",
            "If <b>an animal</b> is <b>in danger</b> of dying, in which case its meat would be prohibited as the animal had not been properly slaughtered, and one wishes to slaughter it in the hope that it will be found fit for eating and he will be spared a loss, <b>he may not slaughter</b> it on a Festival <b>unless there is</b> still <b>time in the day</b> for him <b>to eat an olive-bulk of roasted meat from</b> the animal, so that it is possible to say that he slaughtered the animal for the sake of the Festival. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> There need not be enough time for him to roast it; rather, it is sufficient <b>even</b> if there is only time to eat <b>an olive-bulk of raw</b> meat <b>from the place where</b> the animal <b>is slaughtered,</b> i.e., from its neck, without going to the trouble of removing its hide and roasting it. If <b>one slaughtered</b> an animal on a Festival <b>in the field, he may not bring it</b> to his house <b>on a pole or on a set of poles</b> carried by two people, as this appears similar to a weekday activity. <b>Rather,</b> he must alter his usual weekday manner of performing this action <b>and bring</b> it in <b>by hand, limb by limb.</b> A male firstborn of cattle, sheep, or goats belonging to a Jew is sanctified from birth and must be given to a priest to be sacrificed on the altar in the Temple. If a firstborn animal acquired a physical blemish that disqualifies it from being sacrificed as an offering, it still must be given to a priest, but it may be redeemed, slaughtered, and eaten as non-sacred meat. ",
            "If <b>a firstborn</b> animal <b>fell into a cistern</b> on a Festival, and there is concern that it might die there, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: An expert</b> in these matters <b>goes down</b> into the cistern <b>and examines</b> the animal. <b>If it has</b> a permanent <b>blemish,</b> owing to which it may be slaughtered and eaten, <b>he may raise it</b> from the cistern <b>and slaughter</b> it; <b>but if</b> it does <b>not</b> have a blemish, or if its blemish is temporary, <b>he may not slaughter</b> it. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Even if it has a blemish, it is prohibited to slaughter it, as <b>any</b> firstborn animal <b>whose blemish is not perceptible while it is still day,</b> i.e., on the day before the Festival, <b>is not</b> considered to be <b>among</b> the animals <b>prepared</b> prior to the Festival for use on the Festival.",
            "With regard to <b>an animal that died, one</b> may <b>not move it from its place</b> on a Festival. <b>And</b> such <b>an incident</b> once occurred <b>and they asked Rabbi Tarfon about it. And</b> on that same occasion they also asked him <b>about <i>ḥalla</i> that</b> had been separated from dough and then <b>became ritually impure</b> on a Festival. Such <i>ḥalla</i> is not fit to be eaten by anyone, nor may it be used in any other manner, e.g., as animal feed or as fuel for a fire, on that day. Rabbi Tarfon <b>entered the study hall and inquired</b> about these matters, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>said to him: One</b> may <b>not move them from their place.</b>",
            "<b>One</b> may <b>not register</b> to have a portion <b>of an animal on a Festival <i>ab initio</i>,</b> since it is prohibited to divide up an animal into portions for different people, as this is similar to conducting business, a weekday activity, on a Festival. <b>But one</b> may <b>register for</b> the animal <b>on the eve of the Festival, and</b> then those who registered for the animal may <b>slaughter and divide</b> it <b>between them</b> on the Festival itself in accordance with the agreement reached the day before. The next day, each pays the slaughterer according to his portion of the animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> selling meat on a Festival who wishes to know its weight in order to determine its price may not weigh it against regular weights in the ordinary weekday manner, but he may <b>weigh</b> the <b>meat against</b> a <b>vessel or against</b> a <b>cleaver [<i>kofitz</i>]</b> and then calculate the weight of the meat by weighing the vessel or cleaver later. <b>And the Rabbis say: One</b> may <b>not look at the pans of a</b> balance <b>scale at all,</b> meaning that they may not be used for weighing in any manner or for any other purpose.",

And one may not lead an animal with a stick</b> in the public domain <b>on a Festival; and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, permits</b> it. ",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> On a Festival, <b>a person may remove a sliver</b> from a pile of straw or from similar material <b>that is before him, in order to clean with it</b> between <b>his teeth.

With regard to objects lying in his courtyard, however, as their collection takes great effort, he certainly did not have them in mind the day before, and they are therefore <i>muktze</i>.",
            "The mishna states a different <i>halakha</i>: <b>One may not produce fire, neither from wood,</b> by rubbing one piece against another; <b>nor from stones</b> knocked against each other; <b>nor from</b> hot <b>dirt; nor from tiles</b> struck against each other; <b>nor from water</b> placed in round, glass vessels, which produces fire by focusing the rays of the sun. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>one may not whiten tiles</b> with a burning-hot heat in order <b>to roast upon them</b> afterward. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer further stated</b> the following leniency: <b>A person may stand over</b> objects in <b>storage,</b> such as produce that he has for some reason previously set aside from use, <b>on Shabbat eve during the Sabbatical Year,</b> during which no tithes are separated, which means one may take fruit on the following day without the need for any corrective measure, <b>and say: From here,</b> from these fruits, <b>I will eat tomorrow. And the Rabbis say:</b> He may not eat <b>unless he marks</b> the pile of fruit the day before <b>and</b> explicitly <b>says: From here to there</b> I will take."

This essential difference between a coal and a flame has additional halakhic ramifications: If one uses <b>a coal of consecrated property</b> for a non-consecrated purpose, he is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, since it has substance. <b>But</b> if one uses a consecrated <b>flame,</b> although according to rabbinic law <b>one may not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it <i>ab initio</i>, if one did benefit from it, <b>he is not</b> liable for <b>misuse,</b> since it does not have substance.
