            "\tAn egg that was hatched on yom tov [after Shabbath] — Beth Shammai say: It may be eaten; Beth Hillel say: It may not be eaten. [The rationale of Beth Hillel: Every egg that is hatched today is completed the day before, so that Shabbath is found to have \"prepared\" for yom tov; but Scripture states (Exodus 16:5): \"And it shall be on the sixth day, that they shall prepare (for Shabbath) what they shall bring\" — and the sixth day is generally chol (mundane, not a holy day) — whence: Chol prepares for Shabbath, and chol prepares for yom tov (which is also called \"Shabbath\"), but yom tov does not prepare for Shabbath and Shabbath does not prepare for yom tov. And preparation of the type of the egg, even though it is in the hands of Heaven, is, nonetheless, called \"preparation.\" However, since Shabbath and yom tov are distinctive, their meal requires preparation in chol, and one of them may not prepare for the other, even preparation in the hands of Heaven — but a meal of chol is not distinctive and does not require preparation, so that on a Sunday in general, which is not a yom tov, an egg hatched on it is not to be forbidden because it was prepared on Shabbath, for the Torah does not require preparation for a meal of chol from the day before. And they forbade an egg hatched on any yom tov, even not after Shabbath — a decree by reason of yom tov after Shabbath. Likewise, they forbade sucking raw an egg hatched on any Shabbath — a decree by reason of Shabbath after yom tov. And with Shabbath and yom tov, one following the other, an egg hatched on the first is forbidden on the second. And the same holds with the two days of Rosh Hashanah. But with the two yom tov days of exile, where, perforce, one of them is chol, an egg hatched on the first is permitted on the second.] Beth Shammai say: Se'or (leavening) (is forbidden) with the size of an olive, and chametz (leavened food), with the size of a date. [In respect to eating, all agree that both are forbidden with an olive size, Scripture beginning with se'or and concluding with chametz, viz. (Exodus 12:19): \"Se'or shall not be found in your houses, for all who eat chametz, etc.\" — to apprise us that (in respect to eating) se'or and chametz are one and the same. Where do they differ? In respect to removal. Beth Shammai hold that since (in respect to removal) Scripture wrote of both, se'or and chametz (Ibid. 13:7) rather than writing that chametz, the lesser \"leavening,\" must be removed, whereby we could infer a fortiori that se'or, the greater \"leavening,\" must of a certainty be removed — it must be that the (forbidden) size of one is not the same as that of the other, (the halachah of) removal not being derived from (that of) eating. And Beth Hillel hold that both (are forbidden) with an olive size, removal being derived from eating. And because these (first) three things are among the lenient rulings of Beth Shammai and the stringent rulings of Beth Hillel in respect to yom tov, they are adduced together.]",
            "\tIf one would slaughter an animal or a bird on yom tov [and he takes counsel with beth-din], Beth Shammai say: He should dig with a deker and cover it (the blood) [i.e., Beth-din tell him that he may slaughter it ab initio and dig with a deker stuck (in the ground) that he had prepared before (yom tov). That is, he should remove it from its place, bringing up earth as he does so, and cover (the blood) with that earth. (The instance is one in which it is stuck in moist earth, which is fit for covering (the blood), not requiring to be crumbled. (\"deker\":) a pick, which is stuck in the earth, as in (Numbers 28:8): \"And he pierced (vayidkor) them both through.\"] And they (Beth Hillel) concur that if he had (already) slaughtered it, he should dig with a deker and cover it. And the ashes of a stove are \"prepared\" (muchan). [This does not refer to the instance of Beth Hillel and Beth Shammai, but is an independent statement, viz.: The ashes of a stove are \"prepared,\" and do not need to be especially set aside, for one has them in mind. And this is so only if it had been lit on the eve of yom tov, but if it had been lit on yom tov, it is forbidden, it not being likely that he had had his mind on them from yesterday. And if they suffice for the roasting of an egg, still being hot, then even if it had been lit on yom tov, it is permitted to cover (the blood) with them. For since they may be moved about for the roasting of an egg, he may also take them and use them for covering (the blood).]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: A ladder may not be taken from one dove-cote to another, but it may be inclined from window to window; and Beth Hillel permit it. [With an upper story ladder, all agree that it is forbidden; and with a dove-cote ladder, too, Beth Hillel concede that it is forbidden to carry it in the public domain. For one who sees him might think that he is carrying it to repair his roof and that he will work on yom tov. Where do they differ? When he carries it in a private domain and is not seen by anyone. Beth Shammai hold that he may not do so, for everything that the sages forbade because of \"marith ayin\" (giving the wrong impression) is forbidden even in complete privacy. And Beth Hillel permit it, for even though, in general, it is forbidden — here, because of \"the joy of yom tov\" (i.e., to eat thereon), it is permitted. (\"But it may be inclined from window to window\":) in the same dove-cote. Dove-cotes generally have a nest for each pair (of birds) and a window for each nest.] Beth Shammai say: He may not take them unless he moved them before yom tov, and Beth Hillel say: He stands and says: \"I shall take this and this one.\" [Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel differ only with regard to the first brood, dove-cote keepers generally sparing the first brood (the first two fledglings, with which the mothers \"disport\" themselves and which will not leave.) Beth Shammai hold that speech (designation) does not suffice; for when he takes them the next day, he might come to pity them and change his mind, so that he would have moved them without need (which is forbidden on yom tov). But if he moves them and feels them before yom tov thinking to slaughter them (on yom tov), and he does not pity them (at that time), we no longer apprehend that he will come to pity them later. And Beth Hillel hold that we do not decree for the eventuality that he might come to pity them, even with the first brood.]",
            "\tIf he prepared black and found white, white and found black (they are forbidden). [This (as it stands) is obvious and need not be stated. What is meant is that if he prepared black and white, and found black in the place of white, and white in the place of black, etc. And this is how our Mishnah is to be understood: If he prepared black in one nest and found white in it; and if he prepared white in another nest and found black in it — we might think that they are the same birds and that they changed nests; we are, therefore, apprised otherwise.] (If he prepared) two and found three [and he does not recognize those he prepared], they are [all] forbidden. (If he prepared) three and found two, they are all permitted. [For we assume that one left and the other remained, and we do not say that just as one left so they all left and these are other birds.] (If he prepared them) inside the nest and found them outside [and found nothing inside the nest], they are forbidden. And if they were the only ones there [in the dove-cote], they are permitted. [And even if there is another dove-cote within fifty cubits of it, if that dove-cote is not aligned with this one, but in a corner, we do not surmise that it might have come from that dove-cote; for fledglings, so long as they do not fly, but hop, hop only to a nest aligned with theirs, only, if when they turn around, they can see their nest.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: It is forbidden to remove shutters on yom tov. [Spice-merchants have shops built like chests, standing in the marketplace and not attached to the ground. Shutters are used to close the openings of those chests and sometimes they are removed from the opening and the spices spread out upon them.] Beth Hillel permit even putting them back. [With shutters that are entirely without a hinge, all agree that they may be used to close even the entrance of a house in the courtyard. And with shutters that have a hinge on the side, all agree that it is forbidden to close even the openings of shops with them, this being similar to \"building.\" Where do they differ? In respect to shutters that have a hinge in the middle, a kind of projection which is stuck into a hole in the middle of the wall of the opening of the shop. Beth Shammai hold that we decree against a hinge in the middle by reason of a hinge on the side; and Beth Hillel hold that we do not so decree with shop shutters and that it is permitted to put them back. For he must take out the spices, and if he were not permitted to put them back, he would not open (his shop) and this would detract from \"the joy of yom tov.\"] Beth Shammai say: It is forbidden to take a pestle to carve meat thereon. [A pestle is a large, round piece of wood, used for crushing grits and the like, which, because of its weight and size is not considered a vessel (and thus forbidden to be moved on yom tov).] Beth Hillel permit it [because of \"the joy of yom tov,\" even though it is not considered a vessel.] Beth Shammai say: It is forbidden to place (animal) hide before treaders [so that it not spoil], and it may not be lifted [to move it, after it has been spread out]. Beth Hillel permit it. [For if it were not permitted, he would not slaughter the animal so that the hide not be spoiled, and this would detract from \"the joy of yom tov.\"] Beth Shammai say: Neither a minor, nor a lulav, nor a Torah scroll may be carried out to the public domain [i.e., Nothing (may be carried out) which is not needed for purposes of eating]; and Beth Hillel permit it, [saying: Since it (carrying) was permitted for eating purposes, it was also permitted for non-eating purposes. This, provided that it be for the sake of a mitzvah, as in the instances of our Mishnah, or for some benefit, as (carrying) the key of one's house and the like (as opposed to taking out stones and the like, Beth Hillel conceding that this is forbidden)].",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: It is forbidden to bring challah and (the priestly) gifts to a Cohein on yom tov, whether they were separated (to be given to the priest) the day before or on the day (of yom tov) itself. [Even though it is permitted to separate challah (on yom tov), they did not permit it to be carried (to the priest) but only the \"amending\" of the dough and not more. (\"gifts\":) shoulder, cheeks, and maw.] Beth Hillel permit it. Beth Shammai said to them (to Beth Hillel): Gzeirah shavah (an identity) [Not a real (Torah) identity; for it is all a rabbinic decree stemming from the decree that terumoth and ma'aseroth are not separated on yom tov. It is only \"similar\" to a gzeirah shavah.], viz.: Challah and the (priestly) gifts are gifts to the Cohein; and terumah is a gift to the Cohein [one of the twenty-four priestly gifts.] Just as terumah is not brought (to a Cohein on yom tov), so (the other) gifts are not brought. Beth Hillel rejoined: No, if you say (that it is forbidden), that is in respect to terumah, which he is not authorized to separate — unlike the (priestly) gifts, which he is authorized to separate. [This Mishnah is rejected in the gemara, Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel not disagreeing that challah and gifts are brought but only as to the bringing of terumah, Beth Shammai saying that it is not brought, and Beth Hillel, that it is. Beth Hillel said to Beth Shammai: Challah and the (priestly) gifts are gifts to the Cohein, and terumah is a gift to the Cohein. Just as gifts are brought (to a Cohein on yom tov), so terumah is brought! Beth Shammai rejoined: No, if you say (that it is permitted), that is in respect to challah and (priestly) gifts, which he is authorized to separate, the sages having accorded him the right to do so; for the obligation to do so comes on yom tov (itself), it being permitted to knead and slaughter on yom tov. And since those of yom tov were permitted, they permitted bringing even those which had been separated before yom tov — unlike the instance of terumah, which he is not authorized to separate (on yom tov). For the grain pile cannot be subject to terumah on yom tov, the terumah obligation obtaining only from the time of the leveling of the pile, which is forbidden on yom tov — for which reason it is forbidden to bring terumah (to the Cohein) on yom tov.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: Spices may be pounded (on yom tov) with a wooden pestle, [but not with a stone one. With this wooden pestle, however, they may be pounded in the normal manner, without any variation; for their flavor dissipates if pounded the day before.], and salt (may be crushed) with [an earthen] jug or with a wooden pot ladle. [For (the crushing of) salt requires a variation (shinui), in that it should have been crushed the day before, its flavor not going lost.] And Beth Hillel say: Spices may be pounded in the normal manner, with a stone pestle, and salt, with a wooden one. [The halachah is that one who wishes to crush salt on yom tov turns the pestle on its side and crushes it with a shinui, and spices may be pounded in the normal manner without a shinui.]",
            "\tIf one picks out peas on yom tov — Beth Shammai say: He picks the food and eats it [He picks the food (the peas) one by one from the psoleth (the non-edible parts)], and Beth Hillel say: He picks out (the psoleth) in the normal manner on his lap, in a reed basket, or in a tray, [so long as the exertion of picking out the psoleth is not greater (than that of picking out the food); but if it is greater (as when the psoleth is especially thin), even if there is more food than psoleth, Beth Hillel agree that he picks out the food and leaves the psoleth, reduction of exertion being the prime criterion.]; but he may not (pick it out) on the table, with a sifter, or with a sieve. R. Gamliel says: He may also rinse them and pick it (the psoleth) out (sholeh). [He brings a vessel full of peas, pours water on them, the psoleth rises to the surface, and he removes it with his hand. \"sholeh,\" as in (Exodus 3:5): \"Remove (shal) your shoes.\" The halachah is not in accordance with R. Gamliel.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: One may not send [a gift to his friend] on yom tov, except manoth [something prepared, which is not generally put away for the next day, such as meat or fish.] Beth Hillel say: One may send a beast, an animal, or a bird, whether alive or slaughtered. [Beth Hillel permit sending it only with one or two persons; but it is forbidden to do so with three or more, for this makes a \"stir,\" and the impression is given that they are taking it to market to sell.] One may send wine, oil, meal, and pulse, but not grain, [it not being fit for eating without being ground, and grinding being forbidden on yom tov.] R. Shimon permits it with grain, [for it can be crushed in a small mortar and cooked as a dish. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]",
            "\tClothes may be sent (on yom tov), whether sewn [and fit to be worn] or not sewn [and fit for covering], even if they contain kilayim (a forbidden admixture of materials) [When they are stiff and do not add warmth, it is permitted to lie upon them], so long as they be for the need of the festival. But one may not send a nailed sandal [a sandal of wood covered with nails, the sages having decreed against its being worn on Shabbath and yom tov because of a particular occurrence in which it brought about the death of Jewish martyrs (Shabbath 6b)], nor a sandal which is not sewn, [even if it is held together with wooden pegs or the like]. R. Yehudah says: Nor (may he send) a white shoe, for it requires a craftsman (to blacken it)]. This is the rule: Whatever can be enjoyed may be sent on yom tov. [This is what is meant: Whatever can be enjoyed on a weekday, as it is, without requiring further work, even though it cannot be enjoyed on yom tov (such as tefillin, which can be worn during the week as they are, but which are not worn on yom tov) may be sent on yom tov.]"
        ],
        [
            "\tIf yom tov fell on Sabbath eve, one should not cook to begin with from yom tov to Shabbath, but he cooks for yom tov, and if something is left over, it is left over for Shabbath. [That is, the beginning and prime intent of his cooking should not be for Shabbath, but for yom tov, and what is left over should be for Shabbath.] And he prepares a dish from yom tov eve [as an \"eruv tavshilin\" (\"a mixing of cooking\") and he relies upon it for Shabbath. [Some give the reason for this dish from yom tov eve as kavod Shabbath (honoring the Sabbath), i.e., Remembering Shabbath on yom tov eve, one will select a \"choice portion\" for Shabbath and will not forget Shabbath in the pre-yom tov activity. Others give the reason as kavod yom tov (honoring yom tov). Seeing that there is no baking from yom tov for Shabbath unless it were begun on yom tov eve, (in which instance it is merely completed on yom tov), one will understand that, a fortiori, there is no baking or cooking entirely from yom tov to a weekday. (The blessing for eruv tavshilin is the same as that for eruv chatzerorth (\"a mixing of domains\"). And he must grant (rights in his eruv) through another to all those who wish thereafter to rely upon his eruv, even without their knowledge; for benefit may be conferred upon others even in their absence.] Beth Shammai say: (He prepares) two dishes; and Beth Hillel say: one. And they agree that fish and the egg (placed) upon it are considered two dishes. If it [the dish that he prepared yom tov eve] were eaten or lost, he may not cook upon it (relying upon it) to begin with. And if anything were left of it, he may rely upon it [to cook on yom tov] for Shabbath. [But ab initio, eruv tavshilin does not obtain with less than an olive size, whether for one or a hundred. And if he began his dough and his eruv were lost, he finishes what he began.]",
            "\tIf yom tov fell after Shabbath (i.e., on Sunday), Beth Shammai say: Everything is immersed before Shabbath. [For one must cleanse himself for the festival, and all that requires immersion, both men and vessels, are immersed before Shabbath]. And Beth Hillel say: Vessels (are immersed) before Shabbath, and men (immerse themselves) on Shabbath. [Vessels are immersed before Shabbath, for since they are fit for something after immersion for which they were not fit before immersion, if they were immersed on Shabbath or yom tov, this would be \"amending something\" and would be forbidden. \"Shabbath\" is stated here (rather than \"yom tov\") to apprise us of the \"power\" of Beth Hillel, that they permitted one to immerse even on Shabbath; for the impression is given that he does so for the sake of bathing and cooling off, and not (necessarily) for the sake of ritual cleansing.]",
            "\tAnd they are of one opinion that it is permitted to \"kiss waters\" in a stone vessel to cleanse it (the water, on yom tov). [If one had good drinking water which became unclean, he fills with that water a stone vessel which does not acquire uncleanliness, and he places it in a mikveh of salty or muddy water until both waters \"kiss.\" The first water is thus found to be \"seeded\" and combined with the water of the mikveh and is \"nullified\" in the latter and cleansed. (There is no cleansing in a mikveh for any food or liquid except water alone; and not through the agency of \"immersion,\" but through the agency of \"seeding.\")] But it may not be immersed. [It (the unclean water) may not be placed for \"kissing\" (hashakah) in an unclean vessel which requires immersion so that the immersion cleanse the vessel at the \"kissing\" of the waters.] But one may immerse (on yom tov) from purpose to purpose. [If one immersed his vessels in order to tread olives with them in the olive press for mundane purposes, and then decided to tread grapes with them in the wine press for purposes of terumah, he must immerse them a second time for purposes of terumah. And if he decided to use them for kodesh (Temple consecrations), he must immerse them again for purposes of kodesh. And he may perform that immersion on yom tov, the vessel not being \"amended\" thereby. For the purpose of that immersion is not to raise the vessel from a status of uncleanliness, but to increase the degree of cleanliness.] And (he may immerse vessels) from company to company. [If he immersed vessels in order to eat his Pesach offering with one company, and then decided to eat it with a different company, so that he must immerse his vessels a second time, he may perform that immersion on yom tov.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: [Festival] peace-offerings may be brought [on yom tov], for they are for human consumption; but s'michah (the placing of the hands on the head of the offering) may not be performed (on yom tov), s'michah being forbidden by reason of shvuth (\"resting\" from labor on yom tov). For he leans on it with all of his strength, so that it is as if he is making use of an animal (on yom tov). But s'michah is performed on the eve of the festival, Beth Shammai not holding that s'michah must immediately preceded slaughtering.] Burnt-offerings, however, are not (to be brought on yom tov) [except temidin and mussafin, which are congregational offerings and whose time is fixed. But one may not bring individual burnt-offerings, for they are not for human consumption. And even oloth re'iah (burnt-offerings of \"visitation\") are sacrificed on the other (intermediate) days of the festival, but not on yom tov itself, Scripture stating (Numbers 29:39): \"A solemn assembly shall there be for you\" — for you, but not for the Most High.] And Beth Hillel say: It is permitted to bring peace-offerings and burnt-offerings and to perform s'michah upon them. [Festival peace-offerings and burnt-offerings are brought, it being written (Deuteronomy 16:8): \"a solemn assembly for the L rd\" — everything which is for the L rd. But all agree that vow-offerings and gift-offerings are not offered on a festival, neither burnt-offerings nor peace-offerings.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: One may not heat water for his feet (on yom tov) unless it is fit for drinking. [The Torah permitted (what is necessary for) eating, but not lighting a fire for bathing.] And Beth Hillel permit it. [For since lighting a fire was permitted for purposes of eating, it was also permitted for other purposes so long as some benefit is to be derived therefrom. And the halachah is that one may wash his face, hands, and feet with water that was heated on yom tov eve, but not his entire body, yom tov being decreed against by reason of Shabbath. And with water that was heated on yom tov eve, one may wash his entire body on yom tov.] One may make a bonfire (on yom tov) to warm himself thereby.",
            "\tIn three things R. Gamliel adopts the stringent view, as per the ruling of Beth Shammai: Hot food may not be stored (to be kept warm) from yom tov to Shabbath. [For Beth Shammai hold that one may not bake (on yom tov) unless he has made an eruv with a loaf, and he may not cook unless he has made an eruv with a (cooked) dish, and he may not store food (to be kept warm) unless he had warm food stored from yom tov eve. And Beth Hillel hold that one may bake and cook and store on an eruv of cooked food alone. However, in the gemara it is indicated that Beth Hillel also require loaf and meat. And this is the halachah.] And a menorah is not set up on yom tov. If a menorah of linked sections came apart, it is not set up again; for this is like building, and (interdicted) \"building\" obtains with vessels. And Beth Hillel hold that \"building\" does not obtain with vessels.] And loaves are not baked thick (on yom tov), but thin. [Beth Shammai hold that it is forbidden to bake large loaf on yom tov, and Beth Hillel hold that it is permitted, for when it is large, it bakes better.] R. Gamliel said: \"All the days of my father's house, they never baked thick loaves but only thin ones.\" They responded: \"What can we do for your father's house, who were stringent with themselves and lenient with all of Israel, allowing them to bake thick loaves and chori [a large piece of dough baked on coals, requiring much lighting, for the coals keep on going out, and exertion is entailed. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Gamliel in respect to all of his stringencies as per Beth Shammai.]",
            "\tHe (R. Gamliel) also adopted the lenient view in three things: It is permitted to sweep between the beds (on yom tov). [They used to recline on beds and eat. Because the space (between beds) is small, we do not fear that he might even out holes (in a sand floor), as we do in respect to the house, which, being large, is bound to have holes.] And it is permitted to make mugmar on yom tov [i.e., to place frankincense on coals to inhale the aroma; but all hold that it is forbidden to perfume clothing.] And it is permitted to make a gedi (a kid) mekulas on Pesach night. [\"mekulas\" — roasted with its legs and its entrails at its side, in commemoration of the Pesach offering, concerning which it is written (Exodus 12:9): \"its head, with its legs, with its entrails.\" \"mekulas,\" as a warrior bearing his weapons. The targum of (I Samuel 17:5): \"and a copper helmet\" is \"vekulas dinechash.\" Rambam interprets \"mekulas\" as \"distinctive,\" as in \"kilus.\"] And the sages forbid [all three: sweeping, because he might even out holes; \"mugmar,\" because it is not required by all, but only by the pampered and self-indulgent and those with body odor; \"mekulas,\" because he gives the impression of eating consecrated food outside (the prescribed area). The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tThree things are permitted by R. Elazar b. Azaryah and forbidden by the sages: His cow went out (on yom tov) with the [decorative] strap between her horns. And the sages forbid it. [They consider it a burden and not decoration. (It was not the cow of R. Elazar b. Azaryah, but that of his neighbor. Because he did not protest, however, it is called by his name.)] It is permitted to curry an animal on yom tov [with a small-toothed iron comb, even though one makes sores thereby.] And it is permitted to grind peppers in their [small] mill [designed for that purpose]. R. Yehudah says: Currying an animal on yom tov is forbidden, for it makes sores; but combing an animal [with a large-toothed wooden comb, which does not make sores] is permitted. And the sages say: Both currying and combing are forbidden, [combing being decreed against by reason of currying. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Elazar b. Azaryah in (all of) these three things, but only in respect to currying an animal. For he is consistent in this with R. Shimon, who says that \"an unintended thing (like making a sore) is permitted.\" And we rule in accordance with him. The sages who differ with him hold with R. Yehudah that an unintended thing is forbidden. And this is not the halachah.]",
            "\tA pepper mill acquires uncleanliness by reason of three vessels. [If one of the parts separates, it is not regarded as a fragment of a vessel, which does not acquire uncleanliness), but each one is considered a vessel in itself and acquires uncleanliness, even though when they are on the mill they are connected and look like one vessel]: (It acquires uncleanliness) by reason of \"a receptacle\" [The lower part, which receives the pepper ground through the holes of the sieve, acquires uncleanliness by reason of \"a receiving vessel,\" being a wooden vessel with a receiving element.]; and by reason of a metal vessel [The upper part, which crushes and grinds the pepper acquires uncleanliness by reason of \"a metal vessel.\" It does not acquire uncleanliness as a wooden vessel (flat wooden vessels remaining clean), but because of its lower covering, which is of metal]; and by reason of \"a sieving vessel.\" [The middle part, which surrounds the sieve, does not acquire uncleanliness as a wooden vessel, not being a receptacle. But the sages decreed that a sieve acquire uncleanliness by reason of a weaving vessel, so that even if the sieve if not of metal, it acquires uncleanliness by reason of \"a sieving vessel.\"]",
            "\tA child's carriage [made for a child to play with and set aside for him to sit upon] acquires midras (\"treading\") uncleanliness [If the child were a zav (one with a genital discharge), the carriage becomes av hatumah (a \"progenitor\" of uncleanliness) ], and it may be moved on Shabbath, [for it has the status of a vessel].

Yehudah says: All appurtenances may not be rolled (on Shabbath), except a carriage, because it presses. [Two tannaim (rule here) in accordance with R. Yehudah, the first also representing the view of R. Yehudah, who says that \"something not intended is forbidden.\" And the other tanna comes to apprise us that R. Yehudah did not forbid a child's carriage, because it does not make a groove by \"digging,\" as it rolls, but it presses down the soil beneath it without dislodging it. The halachah has already been stated in accordance with R. Shimon, viz.: one may drag a bed, a chair, and a bench so long as he does not intend to make a groove.]"
