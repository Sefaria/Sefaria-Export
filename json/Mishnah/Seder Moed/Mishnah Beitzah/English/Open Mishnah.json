            "If an egg was hatched on a festival, Beit Shammai say: it may be eaten. And Beit Hillel say: it may not be eaten. Beit Shammai say: [On Pesach, the forbidden measure of] leaven is the equivalent of an olive [in volume], and for leavened food it is the equivalent of a date. Beit Hillel say: for both of them it is the equivalent of an olive.",
            "If one slaughters a non-domesticated animal or poultry on a  festival, Beit Shammai say: one may dig with a spade and cover [the blood with that dirt]. And Beit Hillel say: one should not slaughter [on a  festival], unless one has dust [for covering the blood] prepared from while it was still [the previous] day. And they agree that if one did slaughter, one may dig with a spade and cover. And the dust from a stove is [considered] prepared.",
            "Beit Shammai say: One may not walk a ladder from one dove-cote to another, but one may lean it from one window to another. Beit Hillel permit [even the former]. Beit Shammai say: one should not take [doves from the cote to slaughter them on the festival] unless he had handled them while it was still day. Beit Hillel say: [even without handling them,] one may stand and say, \"I will take this one and this one,\" [and he is permitted to do so].",
            "If one designated black ones [to slaughter on the  festival] and found white ones, or designated white ones and found black ones, or [if one designated] two and found three, [these are] prohibited. If one designated three and found two, [these are] permitted. If [one designated ones] inside the nest and found [ones] in front of the nest, [these are] prohibited. But if those [particular birds] are the only ones there, they are thereby permitted.",
            "Beit Shammai say: One may not remove shutters on a  festival. And Beit Hillel permits even to return [them]. Beit Shammai say: One may not take the pestle to chop meat with it [on a  festival]. And Beit Hillel permit. Beit Shammai say: A hide should not be placed before tramplers, and one may not lift it up, unless there the equivalent of an olive [in volume] of meat on it. And Beit Hillel permits. Beit Shammai say: Neither a small child, nor a lulav, nor a Torah scroll may be taken out into a public domain. And Beit Hillel permit.",
            "Beit Shammai say: One may not bring <i>challah</i> [a portion of dough which one is required to separate out and give to the priests when one bakes bread] nor [priestly] gifts to a priest on a holiday, [regardless of] whether they were separated out the day before, or separated out on that day. And Beit Hillel permit. Beit Shammai said to them, \"[One can infer this law from] a <i>gezerah shavah</i> [a technique of halakhic interpretation employing an established link between identical or nearly identical words]: <i>challah</i> and [priestly] gifts are gifts to the priests, and <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a priest which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by priests or their household] is also a gift to the priest; just as one may not bring <i>terumah</i> [to a priest on a holiday], so too one may not bring the gifts.\" Beit Hillel said to them, \"No; if you said that regarding <i>terumah</i>, which one does not have the right to separate out on a holiday, would you [also] say it regarding [priestly] gifts, which one does have the right to separate out on a  festival?!\"",
            "Beit Shammai say: Spices may be ground with a wooden pestle [on a  festival], and salt [may be ground] in a small vessel or with a wooden spoon. Beit Hillel say: Spices may be ground in their regular way with a stone pestle, and salt with a wooden pestle.",
            "If one is sorting legumes on a  festival, Beit Shammai say: one may sort out the food, and eat it. Beit Hillel say: one may sort in his regular way, into his lap, into a basket, or into a dish, but not with a board, nor a sifter, nor a sieve. Rabban Gamliel says: one may even soak [them in water, so that the husks float upwards,] and remove [the unwanted parts].",
            "Beit Shammai say: One may only send [prepared] food dishes on a holiday. And Beit Hillel say: one may send an animal or a bird, whether living or slaughtered. One may send wines, and oils, and fine flours, and legumes, but not produce. And Rabbi Shimon permits regarding produce.",
            "One may send garments (literally: vessels), whether stitched or non-stitched, and even if they contain <i>kilayim</i> [a forbidden mixture of wool and linen], as long as they are for use on the  festival. But [one may] not [send] a sandal with cleats, nor a non-stitched shoe. Rabbi Yehuda says: also not a white shoe, because it requires a professional ['s work]. This is the general rule: Anything which one may make use of on a  festival may be sent [on a  festival]."
