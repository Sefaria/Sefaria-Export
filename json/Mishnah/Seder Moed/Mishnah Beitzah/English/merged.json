            "If an egg was hatched on a festival, Beit Shammai say: it may be eaten. And Beit Hillel say: it may not be eaten. Beit Shammai say: [On Pesach, the forbidden measure of] leaven is the equivalent of an olive [in volume], and for leavened food it is the equivalent of a date. Beit Hillel say: for both of them it is the equivalent of an olive.", 
            "If one slaughters a non-domesticated animal or poultry on a  festival, Beit Shammai say: one may dig with a spade and cover [the blood with that dirt]. And Beit Hillel say: one should not slaughter [on a  festival], unless one has dust [for covering the blood] prepared from while it was still [the previous] day. And they agree that if one did slaughter, one may dig with a spade and cover. And the dust from a stove is [considered] prepared.", 
            "Beit Shammai say: One may not walk a ladder from one dove-cote to another, but one may lean it from one window to another. Beit Hillel permit [even the former]. Beit Shammai say: one should not take [doves from the cote to slaughter them on the festival] unless he had handled them while it was still day. Beit Hillel say: [even without handling them,] one may stand and say, \"I will take this one and this one,\" [and he is permitted to do so].", 
            "If one designated black ones [to slaughter on the  festival] and found white ones, or designated white ones and found black ones, or [if one designated] two and found three, [these are] prohibited. If one designated three and found two, [these are] permitted. If [one designated ones] inside the nest and found [ones] in front of the nest, [these are] prohibited. But if those [particular birds] are the only ones there, they are thereby permitted.",

Beit Shammai say: One may not take the pestle to chop meat with it [on a  festival]. And Beit Hillel permit. Beit Shammai say: A hide should not be placed before tramplers, and one may not lift it up, unless there the equivalent of an olive [in volume] of meat on it. And Beit Hillel permits. Beit Shammai say: Neither a small child, nor a lulav, nor a Torah scroll may be taken out into a public domain. And Beit Hillel permit.", 
            "Beit Shammai say: One may not bring <i>challah</i> [a portion of dough which one is required to separate out and give to the priests when one bakes bread] nor [priestly] gifts to a priest on a holiday, [regardless of] whether they were separated out the day before, or separated out on that day. And Beit Hillel permit. Beit Shammai said to them, \"[One can infer this law from] a <i>gezerah shavah</i> [a technique of halakhic interpretation employing an established link between identical or nearly identical words]: <i>challah</i> and [priestly] gifts are gifts to the priests, and <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a priest which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by priests or their household] is also a gift to the priest; just as one may not bring <i>terumah</i> [to a priest on a holiday], so too one may not bring the gifts.\" Beit Hillel said to them, \"No; if you said that regarding <i>terumah</i>, which one does not have the right to separate out on a holiday, would you [also] say it regarding [priestly] gifts, which one does have the right to separate out on a  festival?!\"", 
            "Beit Shammai say: Spices may be ground with a wooden pestle [on a  festival], and salt [may be ground] in a small vessel or with a wooden spoon. Beit Hillel say: Spices may be ground in their regular way with a stone pestle, and salt with a wooden pestle.", 
            "If one is sorting legumes on a  festival, Beit Shammai say: one may sort out the food, and eat it. Beit Hillel say: one may sort in his regular way, into his lap, into a basket, or into a dish, but not with a board, nor a sifter, nor a sieve. Rabban Gamliel says: one may even soak [them in water, so that the husks float upwards,] and remove [the unwanted parts].", 
            "Beit Shammai say: One may only send [prepared] food dishes on a holiday. And Beit Hillel say: one may send an animal or a bird, whether living or slaughtered. One may send wines, and oils, and fine flours, and legumes, but not produce. And Rabbi Shimon permits regarding produce.", 
            "One may send garments (literally: vessels), whether stitched or non-stitched, and even if they contain <i>kilayim</i> [a forbidden mixture of wool and linen], as long as they are for use on the  festival. But [one may] not [send] a sandal with cleats, nor a non-stitched shoe. Rabbi Yehuda says: also not a white shoe, because it requires a professional ['s work]. This is the general rule: Anything which one may make use of on a  festival may be sent [on a  festival]."

            "\tIf yom tov fell on Sabbath eve, one should not cook to begin with from yom tov to Shabbath, but he cooks for yom tov, and if something is left over, it is left over for Shabbath. [That is, the beginning and prime intent of his cooking should not be for Shabbath, but for yom tov, and what is left over should be for Shabbath.] And he prepares a dish from yom tov eve [as an \"eruv tavshilin\" (\"a mixing of cooking\") and he relies upon it for Shabbath. [Some give the reason for this dish from yom tov eve as kavod Shabbath (honoring the Sabbath), i.e., Remembering Shabbath on yom tov eve, one will select a \"choice portion\" for Shabbath and will not forget Shabbath in the pre-yom tov activity. Others give the reason as kavod yom tov (honoring yom tov). Seeing that there is no baking from yom tov for Shabbath unless it were begun on yom tov eve, (in which instance it is merely completed on yom tov), one will understand that, a fortiori, there is no baking or cooking entirely from yom tov to a weekday. (The blessing for eruv tavshilin is the same as that for eruv chatzerorth (\"a mixing of domains\"). And he must grant (rights in his eruv) through another to all those who wish thereafter to rely upon his eruv, even without their knowledge; for benefit may be conferred upon others even in their absence.] Beth Shammai say: (He prepares) two dishes; and Beth Hillel say: one. And they agree that fish and the egg (placed) upon it are considered two dishes. If it [the dish that he prepared yom tov eve] were eaten or lost, he may not cook upon it (relying upon it) to begin with. And if anything were left of it, he may rely upon it [to cook on yom tov] for Shabbath. [But ab initio, eruv tavshilin does not obtain with less than an olive size, whether for one or a hundred. And if he began his dough and his eruv were lost, he finishes what he began.]", 
            "\tIf yom tov fell after Shabbath (i.e., on Sunday), Beth Shammai say: Everything is immersed before Shabbath. [For one must cleanse himself for the festival, and all that requires immersion, both men and vessels, are immersed before Shabbath]. And Beth Hillel say: Vessels (are immersed) before Shabbath, and men (immerse themselves) on Shabbath. [Vessels are immersed before Shabbath, for since they are fit for something after immersion for which they were not fit before immersion, if they were immersed on Shabbath or yom tov, this would be \"amending something\" and would be forbidden. \"Shabbath\" is stated here (rather than \"yom tov\") to apprise us of the \"power\" of Beth Hillel, that they permitted one to immerse even on Shabbath; for the impression is given that he does so for the sake of bathing and cooling off, and not (necessarily) for the sake of ritual cleansing.]", 
            "\tAnd they are of one opinion that it is permitted to \"kiss waters\" in a stone vessel to cleanse it (the water, on yom tov). [If one had good drinking water which became unclean, he fills with that water a stone vessel which does not acquire uncleanliness, and he places it in a mikveh of salty or muddy water until both waters \"kiss.\" The first water is thus found to be \"seeded\" and combined with the water of the mikveh and is \"nullified\" in the latter and cleansed. (There is no cleansing in a mikveh for any food or liquid except water alone; and not through the agency of \"immersion,\" but through the agency of \"seeding.\")] But it may not be immersed. [It (the unclean water) may not be placed for \"kissing\" (hashakah) in an unclean vessel which requires immersion so that the immersion cleanse the vessel at the \"kissing\" of the waters.] But one may immerse (on yom tov) from purpose to purpose. [If one immersed his vessels in order to tread olives with them in the olive press for mundane purposes, and then decided to tread grapes with them in the wine press for purposes of terumah, he must immerse them a second time for purposes of terumah. And if he decided to use them for kodesh (Temple consecrations), he must immerse them again for purposes of kodesh. And he may perform that immersion on yom tov, the vessel not being \"amended\" thereby. For the purpose of that immersion is not to raise the vessel from a status of uncleanliness, but to increase the degree of cleanliness.] And (he may immerse vessels) from company to company. [If he immersed vessels in order to eat his Pesach offering with one company, and then decided to eat it with a different company, so that he must immerse his vessels a second time, he may perform that immersion on yom tov.]", 
            "\tBeth Shammai say: [Festival] peace-offerings may be brought [on yom tov], for they are for human consumption; but s'michah (the placing of the hands on the head of the offering) may not be performed (on yom tov), s'michah being forbidden by reason of shvuth (\"resting\" from labor on yom tov). For he leans on it with all of his strength, so that it is as if he is making use of an animal (on yom tov). But s'michah is performed on the eve of the festival, Beth Shammai not holding that s'michah must immediately preceded slaughtering.] Burnt-offerings, however, are not (to be brought on yom tov) [except temidin and mussafin, which are congregational offerings and whose time is fixed. But one may not bring individual burnt-offerings, for they are not for human consumption. And even oloth re'iah (burnt-offerings of \"visitation\") are sacrificed on the other (intermediate) days of the festival, but not on yom tov itself, Scripture stating (Numbers 29:39): \"A solemn assembly shall there be for you\" — for you, but not for the Most High.] And Beth Hillel say: It is permitted to bring peace-offerings and burnt-offerings and to perform s'michah upon them. [Festival peace-offerings and burnt-offerings are brought, it being written (Deuteronomy 16:8): \"a solemn assembly for the L rd\" — everything which is for the L rd. But all agree that vow-offerings and gift-offerings are not offered on a festival, neither burnt-offerings nor peace-offerings.]", 
            "\tBeth Shammai say: One may not heat water for his feet (on yom tov) unless it is fit for drinking. [The Torah permitted (what is necessary for) eating, but not lighting a fire for bathing.] And Beth Hillel permit it. [For since lighting a fire was permitted for purposes of eating, it was also permitted for other purposes so long as some benefit is to be derived therefrom. And the halachah is that one may wash his face, hands, and feet with water that was heated on yom tov eve, but not his entire body, yom tov being decreed against by reason of Shabbath. And with water that was heated on yom tov eve, one may wash his entire body on yom tov.] One may make a bonfire (on yom tov) to warm himself thereby.", 
            "\tIn three things R. Gamliel adopts the stringent view, as per the ruling of Beth Shammai: Hot food may not be stored (to be kept warm) from yom tov to Shabbath. [For Beth Shammai hold that one may not bake (on yom tov) unless he has made an eruv with a loaf, and he may not cook unless he has made an eruv with a (cooked) dish, and he may not store food (to be kept warm) unless he had warm food stored from yom tov eve. And Beth Hillel hold that one may bake and cook and store on an eruv of cooked food alone. However, in the gemara it is indicated that Beth Hillel also require loaf and meat. And this is the halachah.] And a menorah is not set up on yom tov. If a menorah of linked sections came apart, it is not set up again; for this is like building, and (interdicted) \"building\" obtains with vessels. And Beth Hillel hold that \"building\" does not obtain with vessels.] And loaves are not baked thick (on yom tov), but thin. [Beth Shammai hold that it is forbidden to bake large loaf on yom tov, and Beth Hillel hold that it is permitted, for when it is large, it bakes better.] R. Gamliel said: \"All the days of my father's house, they never baked thick loaves but only thin ones.\" They responded: \"What can we do for your father's house, who were stringent with themselves and lenient with all of Israel, allowing them to bake thick loaves and chori [a large piece of dough baked on coals, requiring much lighting, for the coals keep on going out, and exertion is entailed. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Gamliel in respect to all of his stringencies as per Beth Shammai.]", 
            "\tHe (R. Gamliel) also adopted the lenient view in three things: It is permitted to sweep between the beds (on yom tov). [They used to recline on beds and eat. Because the space (between beds) is small, we do not fear that he might even out holes (in a sand floor), as we do in respect to the house, which, being large, is bound to have holes.] And it is permitted to make mugmar on yom tov [i.e., to place frankincense on coals to inhale the aroma; but all hold that it is forbidden to perfume clothing.] And it is permitted to make a gedi (a kid) mekulas on Pesach night. [\"mekulas\" — roasted with its legs and its entrails at its side, in commemoration of the Pesach offering, concerning which it is written (Exodus 12:9): \"its head, with its legs, with its entrails.\" \"mekulas,\" as a warrior bearing his weapons. The targum of (I Samuel 17:5): \"and a copper helmet\" is \"vekulas dinechash.\" Rambam interprets \"mekulas\" as \"distinctive,\" as in \"kilus.\"] And the sages forbid [all three: sweeping, because he might even out holes; \"mugmar,\" because it is not required by all, but only by the pampered and self-indulgent and those with body odor; \"mekulas,\" because he gives the impression of eating consecrated food outside (the prescribed area). The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]", 
            "\tThree things are permitted by R. Elazar b. Azaryah and forbidden by the sages: His cow went out (on yom tov) with the [decorative] strap between her horns. And the sages forbid it. [They consider it a burden and not decoration. (It was not the cow of R. Elazar b. Azaryah, but that of his neighbor. Because he did not protest, however, it is called by his name.)] It is permitted to curry an animal on yom tov [with a small-toothed iron comb, even though one makes sores thereby.] And it is permitted to grind peppers in their [small] mill [designed for that purpose]. R. Yehudah says: Currying an animal on yom tov is forbidden, for it makes sores; but combing an animal [with a large-toothed wooden comb, which does not make sores] is permitted. And the sages say: Both currying and combing are forbidden, [combing being decreed against by reason of currying. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Elazar b. Azaryah in (all of) these three things, but only in respect to currying an animal. For he is consistent in this with R. Shimon, who says that \"an unintended thing (like making a sore) is permitted.\" And we rule in accordance with him. The sages who differ with him hold with R. Yehudah that an unintended thing is forbidden. And this is not the halachah.]", 
            "\tA pepper mill acquires uncleanliness by reason of three vessels. [If one of the parts separates, it is not regarded as a fragment of a vessel, which does not acquire uncleanliness), but each one is considered a vessel in itself and acquires uncleanliness, even though when they are on the mill they are connected and look like one vessel]: (It acquires uncleanliness) by reason of \"a receptacle\" [The lower part, which receives the pepper ground through the holes of the sieve, acquires uncleanliness by reason of \"a receiving vessel,\" being a wooden vessel with a receiving element.]; and by reason of a metal vessel [The upper part, which crushes and grinds the pepper acquires uncleanliness by reason of \"a metal vessel.\" It does not acquire uncleanliness as a wooden vessel (flat wooden vessels remaining clean), but because of its lower covering, which is of metal]; and by reason of \"a sieving vessel.\" [The middle part, which surrounds the sieve, does not acquire uncleanliness as a wooden vessel, not being a receptacle. But the sages decreed that a sieve acquire uncleanliness by reason of a weaving vessel, so that even if the sieve if not of metal, it acquires uncleanliness by reason of \"a sieving vessel.\"]", 
            "\tA child's carriage [made for a child to play with and set aside for him to sit upon] acquires midras (\"treading\") uncleanliness [If the child were a zav (one with a genital discharge), the carriage becomes av hatumah (a \"progenitor\" of uncleanliness) ], and it may be moved on Shabbath, [for it has the status of a vessel]. But it may not be rolled [on Shabbath], except on garments, [for it makes a groove in the ground, and one who \"digs\" is liable by reason of \"plowing.\"] R. Yehudah says: All appurtenances may not be rolled (on Shabbath), except a carriage, because it presses. [Two tannaim (rule here) in accordance with R. Yehudah, the first also representing the view of R. Yehudah, who says that \"something not intended is forbidden.\" And the other tanna comes to apprise us that R. Yehudah did not forbid a child's carriage, because it does not make a groove by \"digging,\" as it rolls, but it presses down the soil beneath it without dislodging it. The halachah has already been stated in accordance with R. Shimon, viz.: one may drag a bed, a chair, and a bench so long as he does not intend to make a groove.]"

            "\tFishes may not be \"hunted\" from fisheries on yom tov. [Even though slaughtering, baking, and cooking are among the avoth melachoth (proto-labors) and are permitted for yom tov needs, hunting is similar to harvesting, and harvesting was not permitted on yom tov.] And food is not placed before them [the fishes; for they can survive without it and there is no obligation to feed them.] But animals and birds [which were prepared the day before] may be hunted from [small] vivariums [where they are readily hunted.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Not all vivaria are alike. [R. Shimon b. Gamliel does not come to differ with the first tanna but to explain his meaning.] This is the rule: Whatever is not readily hunted [i.e., where trapping stratagems must be devised] is forbidden; and whatever is readily hunted [i.e., what can be caught with one bound] is permitted.",

And once a certain gentile brought fish (on yom tov) to R. Gamliel, who said: \"It is permitted, but I do not want to take it from him.\" [The Mishnah is defective. It was taught thus: \"Something that was 'possibly' ready for use (on yom tov eve) is forbidden. R. Gamliel permits it. And once a certain gentile, etc.\" The halachah is not in accordance with R. Gamliel. But fruits and fish that were brought on yom tov, \"possibly\" having been picked or caught (respectively) today or the day before, are forbidden And whatever it is forbidden to eat, it is forbidden to move. And if their appearance \"speaks for them,\" e.g., if the fruits are so shriveled that they could not have been picked today, or if the fish were brought from such a distance that they could not have been caught today, they are permitted. And something ready for use, which was brought from outside the (permitted) bound for a Jew is forbidden to that Jew and to all the members of his household, but permitted to other Jews. And fruits or fish that were picked or caught on the first day of the festival are permitted in the evening, bichdei sheya'asu, for the second day (except for the two days of Rosh Hashanah, where they are forbidden until the end of the second day bichdei sheya'asu. \"kedei sheya'asu\" = \"the amount of time it takes\" from the time of the picking of the fruits until their being brought whence they were brought.

R. Akiva says: (It is permitted) even (if there is enough time for him to eat) an olive-size, raw, from its slaughtering site, [where it is separated from its hide and ready (to be eaten.) the halachah is not in accordance with R. Akiva.] He may not bring it on a large or small pole [carried by two men, because this draws attention to itself and detracts from the dignity of the festival], but he brings it piecemeal in his hand.",

If it had a (permanent) blemish, he may bring it up and slaughter it. [i.e., If the pre-yom tov blemish were not permanent, but it sustained a permanent blemish today, even if he transgressed and brought it up, he may not slaughter it. We do not say: His mind was set on it yesterday and since it now has a permanent blemish, let him slaughter it. For since yesterday's blemish was not permanent, it is muktzeh by reason of prohibition (of slaughtering an unblemished bechor).] R. Shimon says: Any animal whose blemish was not recognized (as a permanent one) before yom tov is not considered ready (for use on yom tov). [He forbids it not because of muktzeh, for muktzeh does not obtain according to R. Shimon. (He forbids it, rather,) because permitting it on yom tov is like amending it, and seems like the pronouncing of a ruling on yom tov, which was decreed against by reason of shvuth (\"resting\"). The intent (of the Mishnah, then,) is: His (the sage's) sanction is no sanction, and it is not \"ready\" to be considered kosher.]",

[A beast of kodshim (dedicated to the Temple) is referred to, as indicated by \"and about challah that became unclean\" (below). Benefit may not be derived from a beast of kodshim that died, and it must be buried, for which reason it may not be moved from its spot (on yom tov). But a beast of chullin (non-dedicated) may be cut up for the dogs. And this, when it was seen to be dying the day before, so that one's mind was on it. But if not, a beast of chullin, too, may not be moved from its spot.] And once they asked R. Tarfon about this and about challah that became unclean, and he went into the house of study and asked. And they said to him: They may not be moved from their place. [Challah that became unclean is not fit for a Cohein on yom tov, neither for kindling nor for feeding to his dog.

Yehudah says: It is permitted to weigh meat against a vessel or against a hatchet. [Even though it is forbidden to weigh by the pound, this being a mundane activity, it is permitted to weigh against a vessel or against a hatchet and so see the next day how much they weigh.] And the sages say: A scale may not be looked at, at all.

Batnith filled his measures on yom tov eve, [it being forbidden to measure on yom tov], and gave them to his customers on yom tov. Abba Shaul says: He did so also on Chol Hamoed (because of the time it takes) to ascertain the exact measure, [in order to avoid neglect of Torah study. For many would come to make inquiries of him on Chol Hamoed, when they were not taken up with their work; and he would fill up his measures at night, when the house of study was not frequented, so as to be free in the daytime.] And the sages say: He did so also during the week because of the draining of the measures. [When he sold oil, he did so with many measures. The customers would bring their vessels and he would measure (oil) for each one separately. The oil would drain into their vessels the entire night so that no oil remained on the sides of his measures and the customers were not \"cheated.\"] One may go to a shopkeeper that he regularly patronizes and ask him for a particular number of eggs or nuts; for it is customary for one to count in his house."

And if it is near, a key is not necessary. \"Near and no key\" or \"a key and not near\" are permitted. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.]", 
            "\tWood (for kindling) is not cut (on yom tov) from beams [for building, arranged on the ground to keep them from bending], nor from a beam that broke on yom tov. [For even though it is fit for kindling now, it was not before yom tov.] And one may not cut: neither with an axe [Our Mishnah is defective. It was taught thus: …\"but one may cut wood from a beam that was broken before yom tov. And when they cut, they cut neither with an axe\"] nor with a saw, [which is a workman's tool], nor with a sickle [This, too, is a workman's tool, and (in using it) he gives the impression that he wishes to perform labor], but [they cut] with a hack, [a butcher's hack, which is not a workman's tool. Some of them have two heads, one wide, called \"female\"; the other, narrow, called \"male.\" And one may cut only with the male head.] A house full of fruits — If it were closed up, and it opened, one may take out (fruits) through the opening. [And we do not say that they are muktzeh by reason of prohibition, it being prohibited to open it on yom tov, so that his mind is not on them. For the \"house\" of our Mishnah is not one built with tar and lime, but an arrangement of bricks, one set atop the other, without tar. So that, there being no Torah prohibition against opening it, the fruits are not muktzeh — just as we say in respect to tevel (untithed produce), that it is not muktzeh; for if he transgressed and amended (i.e., tithed) it (on yom tov), it is amended.] R. Meir says: He may even open it to begin with and take. [For since there is no tar, but only bricks piled one atop the other, this is not soter (\"tearing down\"), and it is permitted to open it ab initio. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Meir.]", 
            "\tOne may not \"open\" a lamp (on yom tov) [by taking one of the potter's \"eggs\" and sticking his fist in it to hollow out (the bowl for) a lamp], for he thereby makes a vessel. And one may not make charcoals on yom tov, [these, too, being \"vessels\" for goldsmiths], and a wick may not be cut in two. [A wick, too, is a \"vessel\" for kindling, requiring preparation. It may not be cut in two, for this is amending a vessel. (But it is permitted to \"mash\" it in one's hand.)] R. Yehudah says: He may cut it by fire into two lamps. [He places the two heads of the wicks in the mouths of two lamps which he must light at the same time, and lights it in the middle. For now he does not give the impression of fashioning something, but of lighting (a lamp). The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah.]", 
            "\tOne may not break a shard or cut paper [on which oil is put, so that it is fire-resistant] to roast a salted (fish), and an oven or a stove may not be scraped [If some of the plaster or lime of the stove fell into it, it may not be scraped, this being \"amending a vessel.\" This ruling is in accordance with the rabbis, who say that \"enabling labors\" for eating are forbidden.], but it [the ash and the residue] may be leveled, [and if baking is impossible unless it is scraped, it is permitted.] And two barrels may not be put close together to place a pot upon them [with the fire between the two barrels, this being forbidden because it looks like \"building\"]. And a pot may not be supported with pieces of wood, [wood being used only for kindling]. And so with a door, [it may not be steadied with a piece of wood, wood being muktzeh for all uses except kindling.] And a beast may not be led with a stick on yom tov, [for the impression is given that it is being led to market to be sold]. R. Elazar b. R. Shimon permits it.", 
            "\tR. Eliezer says: One may take a wood splinter from before him [i.e., from what is before him in the house] to pick his teeth with. [Not necessarily \"from before him,\" for according to R. Eliezer it is even permitted to take one from the courtyard; for he says: \"Whatever is in the courtyard is 'prepared.'\" \"from before him\" is stated because of the rabbis, who differ with him, saying that even from before him — to kindle, it is permitted; to pick (his teeth) it is not permitted, the rabbis holding that wood may be used only for kindling.] And he may collect (wood) from the courtyard and kindle it, for whatever is in the courtyard is \"prepared.\" And the sages say: He collects from what is before him and kindles, [but not from the courtyard. For since splinters are thin and it is difficult to gather and collect them, they did not \"stand\" for this from the day before. As to your saying: \"He may take a splinter to pick his teeth with,\" we (the rabbis) hold that even from before him he may take wood only for kindling, wood being permitted only for that purpose. They differ in both instances, and the halachah is in accordance with the sages. It is permitted to take a pick for one's teeth only from the manger, and he may not cut or fashion it for this unless it is fit to be eaten by an animal. For anything which is fit to be eaten by an animal may be cut both on yom tov and on Shabbath and is not regarded as \"fashioning a vessel.\"]", 
            "\tOne may not extract fire (on yom tov) [this being \"molid\" (\"creating\"), which is similar to working, the fire being created on yom tov], neither from wood (i.e., by rubbing two pieces of wood together), nor from stones, nor from earth [There is a certain type of earth which emits sparks when dug from its source], nor from water. [Water is put into a vessel of white glass and placed in the sun when it is very hot. The glass becomes red hot, flax is brought and touched to the glass, and it burns.] And re'afim [hollowed earthen tiles used for covering roofs] may not be heated [in fire] for roasting (food) in them. [This, only with new tiles, for he \"fashions\" them by this heating, the fire glazing and hardening them.] R. Eliezer said further [Because he ruled leniently in respect to muktzeh (4:6) and does so again, \"further\" is stated]: A man stands over the muktzeh (the place where fruit is spread for drying), the fruit requiring hazmanah (prior designation for use on Shabbath) and hazmanah availing it] on Sabbath eve in the sabbatical year, [when the tithe does not obtain and the figs lack only hazmanah. The same applies to what is tithed, on the other (non-shemitah) years, but the tanna speaks of the ordinary instance, muktzeh, ordinarily, not having been tithed. For dried figs and raisins are generally \"muktzeh,\" and they are not tithed until completely processed], and he says: \"From here I shall take for tomorrow,\" [this sufficing, breirah (retroactive designation) obtaining.] The sages say: (This does not avail) until he indicates [by sign] \"from here and from here,\" [breirah not obtaining. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]"

            "\tOne may drop fruit through the arubah (an aperture) on yom tov, but not on Shabbath. [They permitted one who had fruits or produce spread on his roof for drying, who saw rain coming, to exert himself and throw them to the ground (in his house) through the aperture in his roof, this not entailing great effort. And this, only with an aperture, where the fruit need merely be dropped, but with a window (as with a roof surrounded by a wall with a window in it), where he must lift the fruit to the window and then drop it — so much exertion was not permitted by the rabbis.] And fruits may be covered with vessels (to protect them) from a drip [in the roof. And we do not consider this an exertion not required for yom tov, the rabbis having permitted it because of the monetary loss involved.] The same applies to pitchers of wine and pitchers of oil [i.e., they may be covered (to protect them) from the drip.] And a vessel may be placed under a drip on Shabbath [to collect the water so that the house not be muddied. And if the vessel fills up, he need not hesitate to spill it out and repeat the process.]", 
            "\tWhatever one is liable for by reason of shvuth (\"resting\") [i.e., whatever the sages forbade one from doing on Shabbath by reason of shvuth], or reshuth (a permitted activity), [where there is \"somewhat\" of a mitzvah, but not a distinct mitzvah, so that it has a semblance of \"reshuth\" (and which is forbidden by the scribes)], or mitzvah [i.e., where there is a distinct mitzvah, but which the rabbis forbade on Shabbath], (Whatever one is liable for by reason of shvuth), one is liable for [i.e., he may not do it] on yom tov. Shvuth: [those things which the sages charged one to \"rest\" from, and in the doing of which there is no mitzvah]: One may not climb a tree [a decree, lest he tear (something from it) ], and one may not ride on an animal [a decree, lest he cut a vine-rod in order to lead it], and one may not swim [a decree, lest he make \"a swimmer's bottle\"], and one may not clap [hand to hand], and one may not slap [hand to thigh], and one may not dance, [all decrees lest one make musical instruments]. Reshuth: One may not render a (halachic) ruling. [Sometimes, this is (entirely) reshuth, as when there is a higher authority in the city in which instance it is not incumbent upon him (a lesser sage) to rule.], and one may not betroth. [Sometimes it is not a distinct mitzvah, but reshuth, as when one has a wife and children.], and one may not perform chalitzah nor yibum. [When one has an older brother, this is also reshuth, it being a mitzvah for the eldest brother to perform yibum. The reason for all of these — a decree, lest he write.] Mitzvah: One may not dedicate (to the Temple), and one may not assess, [e.g., \"The value of that man is upon me\" (to give to the Temple), and he gives according to age as explained in the section on assessments (Leviticus 27:1-8)], and one may not make devotions (charamin) [e.g., \"This beast is devoted.\" Devotions, unqualified, are for Temple maintenance. The rabbis forbade all of these (on yom tov) for they are similar to buying and selling, something passing from his domain to that of hekdesh (the Temple)], and one may not separate terumah and ma'aser (on yom tov) [even to give it to the Cohein on that day, where it is evident that he is separating them for the Cohein's festival joy — still, it is forbidden, for he thereby \"amends\" (the produce). This, with what was tevel (subject to tithing) the day before, but with what had become tevel today, such as dough, from which challah must be taken, he separates it on yom tov and gives it to the Cohein.] All of these were stated in respect to yom tov — a fortiori, in respect to Shabbath. There is no difference between yom tov and Shabbath but food (preparation) alone, (being forbidden on Shabbath but permitted on yom tov.) [This anonymous Mishnah is in accordance with Beth Shammai, who say (1:5): \"Neither a minor, nor a lulav, nor a Torah scroll may be carried out to the public domain (on yom tov),\" only what is necessary for eating having been permitted. But we rule in accordance with Beth Hillel, who say that since carrying was permitted for eating purposes, it was permitted for other purposes, too. (Another difference is the dropping of fruits through the aperture (5:1), which is forbidden on Shabbath and permitted on yom tov.)]", 
            "\tA beast and vessels are \"as the feet of the owner.\" [One may take them on yom tov only to a place where the owner is permitted to go.] If one gives his beast to his son or to a shepherd, they are \"as the feet of the owner.\" [Our Mishnah speaks of an instance in which there are two shepherds in the city, and where it is not known to which one he intends to give it. For this reason, they are \"as the feet of the owner\" if the beast is not with the shepherd before yom tov. But if there is only one shepherd in the city, all the people of the city place their animals in his keeping and in the \"resting\" (i.e., the permitted yom tov distance) that he has acquired, and the beast, then, is \"as the feet of the shepherd.\"] Vessels specific for one of the brothers in the house are \"as his feet.\" And those which are not specific [for one, but shared in common] are \"as the place where they go.\" [i.e., Wherever they are permitted to go, they may take the vessels. But if one of them made an eruv two thousand cubits to the north, and the others did not, he prevents them from taking them even one cubit to the south because of his share; and they prevent him from taking it farther than two thousand cubits to the north, which is their permitted distance.]", 
            "\tIf one borrows a vessel from his neighbor before yom tov, it is \"as the feet of the borrower,\" having acquired its \"resting\" with him ben hashmashoth (at twilight); for ben hashmashoth, which marks the entry of the (new) day, acquires \"resting.\" And even if it did not come to the hand of the borrower until yom tov, not being in his domain ben hashmashoth, it is still \"as the feet of the borrower.\" And if he borrowed it on yom tov, after dark, it is \"as the feet of the lender,\" having acquired \"resting\" with the owner (even if he were accustomed to borrowing it every yom tov.)] If a woman borrows from her neighbor spices [for her dish] and water and salt for her dough, they [the pot and the dough] are as the feet of both. [They may be taken to a place only where both can go, [for since she borrowed it on yom tov, the spices or the water and the salt acquired \"resting\" with the owner.] R. Yehudah exempts (the borrower) with (respect to) the water, for it is not substantial [i.e., it is not recognizable in the dish or in the dough (as when the dish is thick, so that the water is not recognizable in it), for which reason their being taken somewhere is not impeded (by the presence of the water). And R. Yehudah does not differ in respect to salt, the instance being one of dough which was kneaded with thick, coarse salt, which is recognizable and substantial. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]", 
            "\tA coal is \"as the feet of the owner,\" and a flame (may be taken by the borrower) in any place (where the borrower may go). [If one lit his lamp by his neighbor's flame, he is not impeded in respect to interdicted bounds.] Me'ilah [abuse of consecrated objects] obtains with a coal of hekdesh (the Temple). [If one benefits from it, he brings a me'ilah gilt-offering.]; and with a flame (of hekdesh), one may not benefit from it [ab initio, by rabbinical ordinance] and [if he did benefit from it], me'ilah does not obtain. [He need not bring a me'ilah offering, for a flame is not substantial. Likewise,] if one carries a coal to the public domain (on Shabbath), he is liable; and with a flame, [if he pushed it with his hand from a private domain to the public domain], he is not liable. A well owned by an individual is \"as the feet of the individual.\" [The water is taken only (as far) \"as the feet of the owner of the well.\"]; and (a well owned in common) by the people of a city, \"as the feet of the people of that city.\" [The water may be taken two thousand cubits in every direction outside its outskirts.]; and (the water of a well) of those who come up from Bavel, [a well made for travelers in the middle of the road by the Jews of the exile to drink from when they would come up (to Eretz Yisrael)] is \"as the feet of the filler.\" [For it (the water) is hefker (unowned), and hefker is acquired by lifting. So that if another came and asked to borrow his water, he may take it only as far \"as his (the lender's) feet.\" For this tanna holds that breirah (retroactive designation) obtains towards stringency (of ruling), so that as of yesterday it is \"huvrar\" (from \"breirah\") that the water belonged to this man (the lender) and that it was in his domain. This, as opposed to the view of R. Yochanan b. Nuri that articles of hefker acquire \"resting\" for themselves in their place.]", 
            "\tIf one had his fruits in a different city, and the men of that city made an eruv to bring some of his fruit to him, they may not bring it, [since he had not made an eruv to that city; for his fruits are like him (in this regard)]. And if he had made an eruv (to that city), his fruits are like him.",
