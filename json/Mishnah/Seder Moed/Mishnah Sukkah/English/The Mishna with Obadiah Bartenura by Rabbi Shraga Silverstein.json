            "\tA succah that is higher than twenty cubits is pasul (unfit), [for a succah must be a temporary dwelling, it being written (Deuteronomy 16:13): \"The festival of succoth shall you make for yourself for seven days.\" The Torah hereby says: Make a succah (to last) for (a period of) seven days. And above twenty cubits, one does not make a temporary dwelling, but a permanent one.] R. Yehudah rules it kasher, [holding that a succah must be a permanent dwelling. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] And the following are unfit: one that is less than twenty handbreadths, [this being a fetid dwelling, and one does not live in a fetid dwelling.], one lacking three walls, [it being written (Leviticus 23:42): \"In succoth,\" \"in succoth,\" \"in succoth,\" two defective (without the vav) and one plene (with the vav, having the effect of two): one, for the schach (the covering of the succah), the meaning of \"succah\" being \"schach,\" leaving us with three, for three walls. A halachah to Moses on Sinai \"comes and reduces one wall,\" setting it at a handbreadth. So that we are left with two of regulation size, and one, even a handbreadth. Therefore, if a succah has two walls, one next to the other, a third wall is made of somewhat more than a handbreadth and placed less than three handbreadths away from one of the two walls. For anything less than three handbreadths away from something is considered as joined to it (lavud), so that it (the third wall) is considered as one of four handbreadths, so that most of the wall is made and we have a succah of three walls, to which the form of an entrance must be added. And if the two walls are opposite each other, with an empty space in between, a board somewhat more than four handbreadths is brought and stood less than three handbreadths away from one of the two walls, so that the board is considered to be one of seven cubits, which is the (required) size for the kashruth of a succah in length and width, a succah needing to be seven by seven in order to contain one's head and most of his body and his table — six by six for his head and most of his body, and one by one for his table.], and one whose sun is more than its shade. [But if they are equal, it is kasher, And this is so only when they are equal below, on the ground of the succah, in which instance it is certain that above, in the schach, the shade is greater than the sun, as people say: \"A zuz above is an astira (half a zuz) below.\"] An old succah — Beth Shammai rule it pasul, and Beth Hillel rule it kasher. What is \"an old succah\"? One which was made thirty days before the festival. But if it were made for the sake of the festival, even from the beginning of the year, it is kasher. [Beth Shammai rule it pasul, for they require a succah lishmah (for the sake of the mitzvah); but this one was made without such intent. But if it were made within thirty days of the festival, since in that period people review the halachoth of the festival, it is assumed that it was made lishmah. Before thirty days, it is assumed otherwise. And Beth Hillel rule it kasher, for they do not require a succah (to be made) for the sake of the festival.]",
            "\tIf one makes his succah under a tree, it is as if he would have made it in his house [and it is pasul]. (If one built) a succah atop a succah, the upper is kasher and the lower pasul, [for it has two schachs, and Scripture invalidates a succah under a succah.] R. Yehudah says: If there is no \"dwelling\" in the upper, [i.e., if the upper cannot be used as a dwelling, as when the roof of the lower cannot support the mattresses and covers of the upper], the lower is kasher. The first tanna and R. Yehudah do not differ where it cannot support them at all, all agreeing in such an instance that the lower is kasher with the schach of the upper, its own roof not being considered a roof, so that it is not a succah under a succah. And if it were strong enough to support the mattresses and covers of the upper, all agree that it is pasul. Where do they disagree? When it can support them only with difficulty, as when the lower roof sways and buckles from the (weight of) the mattresses and covers of the upper. The first tanna holds that this is called \"a succah under a succah,\" and is pasul; and R. Yehudah holds that since it supports them only with difficulty, it is not considered a roof and it is not called \"a succah under a succah.\" The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",
            "\tIf he spread a sheet over it because of the sun, or under it (i.e., under the schach) because of the fall, or on the kinof, it is pasul. [(\"the fall\":) so that leaves and twigs not fall upon the table. Another interpretation: so that the leaves not fall when they dry up and the succah remain \"its sun greater than its shade.\" A sheet can acquire tumah (uncleanliness) and is (therefore) pasul as schach. And this is so only (if he spreads the sheet) because of the fall; but if he does so to beautify (the succah) it is kasher. (\"or on the kinof\":) That is, even if he did not spread it because of the fall, but for decoration, on his bed, on the kinof — four poles for the four feet of his bed, which are high. He places poles from one to the other on top of them at a distance from the schach, so that now he is not using something that acquires tumah as schach, for he did not place it there for that purpose. It is pasul, for (in such an instance) he is not dwelling in a succah, a tent intervening.] But he may spread it on the naklitin (the posts) of the bed, [which are only two, in the middle of the bed, one at the head, the other at the foot. A pole is extended from one to the other and a sheet paced on it. And because it does not have a roof a handbreadth wide, it is not called a tent.]",
            "\tIf he suspended over it a grape-vine, or gourd, or ivy, using them as schach, it is pasul, [what is attached (to the ground) not being kasher as schach]. But if the (kasher) schach was more (abundant) than the others, or if he cut them, it is kasher. [(\"if the schach was more\":) If there were much more kasher schach than vine or gourd, it is kasher. This, if he pressed them down and intermixed them with the kasher schach so that they are not conspicuous. For, the kasher schach predominating, it \"cancels them out\" when they are intermixed. (\"or if he cut them:\") Even after he suspended them as schach it is kasher; this, on condition that he move them about after cutting them. For if he does not do so, it is pasul, it being written (Leviticus 16:13): \"The festival of succoth shall you make for yourself\" — and not from what is already made. That is, when you make it, it must be (from what is) fit for a succah, and not \"from what is made,\" i.e., something pasul, which is not fit for a succah but which you amend, as when you attempt to make it kasher by (merely) cutting it and not undoing it. But moving it about is like undoing it and then using it as schach, lifting one and putting it down, and repeating the process with the others.] This is the rule: Whatever can acquire tumah and does not grow in the ground cannot be used as schach, [to exclude (from use) wooden vessels, flaxen clothing, and mats, which, even though they originate in the ground, cannot be used as schach, since they can acquire tumah.] And whatever cannot acquire tumah and grows in the ground can be used as schach, [it being written (Deuteronomy 16:13): \"The festival of succoth shall you make for yourself … from your threshing floor and from your winepress.\" Scripture speaks of the discards of the threshing floor and the winepress, i.e., what is left over after you have gathered in (the fruits of) your threshing floor and your winepress, such as straws and vines. From them, make a succah.]",
            "\tBundles of straw and bundles of wood and bundles of zradin [kinds of reeds, used as animal food when moist, and as fuel, when dry] are not to be used as schach [when they are tied. Not because they are pasul; but sometimes one comes with his bundle on his shoulder and places it on top of the succah to dry — and then he decides to use it as schach. But Scripture states: \"shall you make\" — and not from what is already made with what is pasul (see 1:4). And this is not even made for shade but for drying, so that it is made \"with what is pasul.\"] And all of them [that we learned to be pasul as schach] — if he untied them, they are kasher. And they are all kasher as walls. [For \"succah\" connotes schach and not walls.]",
            "\tIt is permitted to use boards as schach. These are the words of R. Yehudah. R. Meir forbids it. [With boards the size of four handbreadths, which (size) is considered \"a space of significance,\" all agree that it is pasul. With less than three, all agree that it is kasher (for in that instance they are like reeds). Where do they differ? (With boards) from three to four handbreadths. R. Yehudah holds that since that is not \"a space of significance,\" we do not decree (against it) lest he sit under the ceiling of his house. And R. Meir holds that since it leaves the status of lavud (see 1:1), we decree (against it), lest he say: \"What difference does it make whether I use these as schach or sit under the ceiling of my house?\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah.] If he placed upon it a board which is broader than four handbreadths, it is kasher, so long as he does not sleep under it.",
            "\tA ceiling [made of beams or boards], which is not tarred — R. Yehudah says: Beth Shammai say: He dislodges and moves all of them about [to validate it as a succah] and he takes out one from between (each two) [and places kosher schach in its place.] And Beth Hillel say: He dislodges and moves them about or he takes out one from between. [R. Yehudah is consistent with his ruling that it is permitted to use boards as schach. Therefore, dislodging suffices, and without dislodging it is pasul because of \"shall you make\" and not from what is already made.] R. Meir says: He takes out one from between and he need not dislodge. [R. Meir is consistent with his ruling that it is forbidden to use boards as schach. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah in the name of Beth Hillel.]",
            "\tIf one roofs his succah with spits, [which are not fit for schach because they do not grow in the ground] or with bed boards, [which can acquire uncleanliness] — If the space between them is like them (in size), it is kasher. [Not \"exactly like them and not more\"; for the place of the spit is considered parutz (\"breached\"), and when he puts kosher schach between each spit, if the space between them is exactly like them, then the parutz is the same as the amud (the part that is intact), and it is pasul. Perforce, then, the space between them must be somewhat larger than they are.] If one hollowed out a stack of sheaves to make a succah of it, it is not a succah. [If he took from the lower sheaves near the ground and hollowed out a space the size of a succah, the schach is found to be already made and standing of itself — but the Torah said: \"shall you make,\" and not from what is already made. But if there were already in it the space of a handbreadth extending seven (handbreadths) which he made to be schach, and he hollowed it out until he elevated the space to a height of ten (handbreadths), this is not considered as already made, for he hereby adjusts only the walls; and \"shall you make, but not from what is already made\" does not apply to the walls — so that it is like a succah less than ten (in height), which was hollowed out to bring it up to ten.]",
            "\tIf one lowers walls from above to below, [i.e., If he began to weave the walls close to the schach and continued weaving them downwards] — If it (the wall) is three handbreadths higher than the ground, it is pasul. [For a goat can then jump in at one bound and it (the lowered wall) is not considered a partition.] From below to above — If it is ten handbreadths higher than the ground, it is kasher [even if it does not reach the schach and is considerably removed from it.] R. Yossi says: Just as ten tefachim [of weaving] suffices from bottom to top, so it suffices from top to bottom, [even if it is well above the ground, R. Yossi holding that a suspended partition validates (the succah). The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yossi.] If he removes the schach three handbreadths from the walls, it is pasul. [This does not refer to (removal from) the top, but to the width; i.e., if he left space between the wall and the schach along the length or breadth of the succah.]",
            "\tIf a roof fell in [in the middle] and he put schach there (in the open space), [so that the walls are at a distance from the schach, it is kasher.] If there are four cubits from the wall to the schach, it is pasul. [If, less than that, it is kasher. For it is a halachah to Moshe upon Sinai that we say \"a bent-over wall\" (is kasher) up to four cubits. We perceive the roof of the house as an extension of the wall, reaching until the schach (and he may not sleep under it.) The same applies to a courtyard with an exedra, [where he put schach in the \"atmosphere\" of the courtyard, distant from the walls of the exedra. (An exedra is a place surrounded by three walls)]. A large succah, ringed (on top) by something which may not be used as schach — If there is below it, (i.e., from where it begins, until the wall) four cubits, it is pasul. [Any succah where, if the pasul schach were removed, there would remain seven by seven handbreadths of kosher schach, is called \"a large succah.\" (\"ringed by something which cannot be used as schach\":) only at the side (of the roof), where the succah is rendered pasul only if there are four cubits of pasul schach by reason of (the perception of) \"a bent-over wall\"; but in the middle of the succah, it renders it pasul (even) with (only) four handbreadths. And space without schach at all, whether in the middle or on the side, renders the succah pasul with three handbreadths  (of such space).]",
            "\tIf one makes his succah in the shape of a cone, [so that it does not have a roof], or if he supports it on a wall, [inclining the tops of the reeds to the wall, the reeds slanting downwards to the ground], R. Eliezer rules it pasul because it lacks a roof. [It is not clear what is roof and what is wall. For a slanted tent is not called a tent, but only one which has a roof of (at least) a handbreadth.] And the sages rule it kasher. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer.] A large reed mat made for reclining acquires tumah and may not be used for schach. For schach, it may be used for schach and it does not acquire tumah. [With respect to a small mat, there is no difference of opinion, all agreeing that it is made for reclining and not for schach (roof covering). Where do they differ? With respect to a large mat. The first tanna holds that a large one is made for schach and a small one for reclining. And his words are to be understood thus: A large mat is made for schach, but if he expressly states that he is making it for reclining, it acquires tumah and may not be used as schach. \"For schach, it may be used for schach\": This is to be understood as follows: And a small mat is made for reclining; but if he expressly states that he is making it for schach, it may be used as schach.] R. Eliezer says: Both small and large are made [ab initio] for reclining. [Therefore,] it [even a large one] acquires tumah, and may not be used as schach. [But if he expressly stated that it is] to be used for schach, it may be used as schach and it does not acquire tumah. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer.]"

            "\tIf one sleeps under a bed in a succah he has not fulfilled his obligation. [This, if the bed is twenty handbreadths or higher, in which instance it is regarded as a tent, which acts as a partition between himself and the succah. (And the essential mitzvah of succah is eating, drinking, and sleeping therein.)] R. Yehudah said: We used to sleep under the bed before the elders, and they said nothing (in protest). [R. Yehudah holds that a temporary tent does not nullify a permanent one. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] R. Shimon said: Once, Tevi the bondsman of R. Gamliel was sleeping under the bed, and R. Gamliel said to the elders: \"Did you observe Tevi my bondsman? He is a Torah scholar and knows that bondsmen are exempt from the (mitzvah of) succah. [For women are exempt from time-based positive commandments; and (only) those mitzvoth binding upon women are binding upon bondsmen.] Therefore, he is sleeping under the bed.\" And as a matter of course, [even though he was speaking casually, expressing pride in his bondsman], we learned that one who sleeps under the bed (in a succah) has not fulfilled his obligation.",

Yehudah is consistent with his view that a succah must be a permanent dwelling. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] Succah meduvleleth [one in which he did not place the reeds together, one alongside the other, but one higher and one lower, so that the sun is more than the shade], if its shade is more than its sun, it is kasher.

            "\tIf one makes his succah on top of a wagon [even though it moves and is not fixed in place], or on top of a boat [in the sea, where the wind buffets it], it is kasher. [For it is called a \"dwelling\" so long as it can withstand a normal wind on shore.] And it is permitted to go up to it on the festival. [This is stated (only) because of: \"And it is not permitted to go up to it\" (below)]. (If he makes his succah) on top of a tree, [making a place for it, with partitions and schach], or on top of a camel, it is kasher [on Chol Hamoed]; but it is not permitted to go up to it on the festival, [the rabbis having decreed against going up into a tree and against making use of it, lest he come to tear (from it)]. (If he made) two on a tree, and one by man, [i.e., If he supported most of the floor of the succah on a tree, and built around it two walls on top of the tree and one (man-made) on the ground, joining the floor of the succah to the middle of the wall built on the ground and raising the wall ten handbreadths higher (than the point of juncture)], or two by man and one in on a tree, it is kasher; but it is not permitted to go up to it on the festival. [Since, if it (the one wall on the tree) were removed, the floor of the succah would give, not being able to stand by the support of the ground walls alone, it is not permitted to go up to it on the festival, doing so constituting making use of the tree.] If he made three by man and one on a tree, it is kasher, and it is permitted to go up to it on the festival. This is the rule: Every succah which, if the tree were removed, could stand by itself, is kasher, and it is permitted to go up to it on the festival.",

And he must also fill the spaces between the branches with straw so that the wind not move them. For any partition that cannot withstand a normal wind is not a partition.] \"Messengers of a mitzvah\" are exempt from (the mitzvah of) succah. [For one who is occupied with a mitzvah is exempt from a (different) mitzvah. And not only when he is engaged in the performance of the mitzvah, but even when he is not thus engaged, e.g., as when he is on his way to receive his rabbi or to redeem captives. He is exempt even while resting (on the road).] Those who are ill and their attendants are exempt from succah, [even those who are slightly ill. The rationale for non-performance of a positive commandment of the Torah because of slight illness, or because of the discomfort caused by foul odors or bed bugs or fleas, in which instances one is exempt (from the mitzvah of succah), as well as the rabbis' exempting travelers and keepers of gardens and orchards from succah is (Leviticus 23:42): \"In succoth shall you sit,\" similar to \"shall you dwell.\" For whatever reason one would leave his dwelling, he may also leave his succah. But if one makes his succah ab initio in a place where he is bound to eat or to sleep in discomfort, as in a place where he is in fear of being robbed in his sleep, even if he is not in fear of thieves or robbers while eating — he does not fulfill his succah obligation even when eating, in that the succah does not serve all his needs: eating, drinking, and sleeping. For \"shall you dwell\" must be satisfied, and such a succah fails to satisfy it.] It is permitted to eat and drink \"casually\" outside the succah [a snack to ally one's hunger, with the intent of eating a regular meal (in the succah) afterwards.]",

Tzaddok food less than the size of an egg, [so that he not have to recite the (concluding) blessing [(For, as far as succah is concerned, it has already been stated that one may eat \"casually\" outside the succah — even more than the size of an egg)], he took it in a cloth, ate it outside the succah, and did not recite the concluding blessing.",

Just as the eating of matzah on the first night of Pesach is mandatory, and, on the other days, optional; so, too, in respect to (eating in a) succah.] R. Eliezer said further: If one did not eat (in a succah) the nights of the first festival, he must make it up on the nights of the second festival [i.e., the night of Shemini Atzereth].

[After the first tekioth, he would wait the amount of time it takes to roast a small fish and blow: tekiah, teruah, tekiah — these last three tekioth to announce the arrival of the Sabbath.] On Sabbath eve in the midst of the festival (Succoth), there were forty-eight (tekioth): three at the opening of the gates [of the azarah, as on all days], three at the upper gate, [as stated above (5:4): \"Two priests would stand in the upper gate … When the rooster crowed, they would blow: tekiah, teruah, tekiah\"], three at the lower gate, [as we learned above: \"When they reached the azarah, they would blow: tekiah, teruah, tekiah, and they would draw out the tekiah until they reached the lower gate.\" As it was taught: \"They blew as they went until they reached the lower gate\" — hence: \"three at the lower gate.\" (The three of the tenth ascent are not reckoned, this tanna holding with R. Eliezer b. Yaakov, who says that they did not blow at the tenth ascent.)], three at the filling of the water [After they drew it and came to the azarah through the Water Gate, they blew: tekiah, teruah, tekiah.], three \"atop the altar\" [(Ibid. 4:5): \"They would stand them on the sides of the altar … They would blow: tekiah, teruah, tekiah.\" Our tanna does not adduce here the instance of Pesach eve falling out on a Sabbath. (For the Pesach offering is slaughtered in three groups and there were many tekioth there.) (Still, he does not adduce it) for it is not that common for Pesach eve to fall on a Sabbath. As to our learning: \"There are to be no more than forty-eight (tekioth)\" — not necessarily. For when Pesach eve falls out on a Sabbath, sometimes there are as many as fifty-seven tekioth.], nine at the morning tamid, nine at the afternoon tamid, nine at the mussafin, three to (signal) the people to stop working, and three to separate the holy from the profane.",
            "\tOn the first day of the festival [of Succoth], there were thirteen bullocks, two rams, and one goat, so that fourteen lambs were left for eight watches. On the first day, six (watches) sacrificed two each, and the (two) others, one each. [There were twenty-four priestly watches in the Temple, and all went up (to Jerusalem) for the festival and acquired the (privileges in the) obligatory festival offerings. Sixteen watches sacrificed sixteen beasts — thirteen bullocks, two rams, and one goat. There remained eight watches for fourteen lambs. Six of the eight sacrificed two each, making twelve lambs. The two remaining watches sacrificed one each.] On the second day, [when there was one bullock less, so that nine watches were left for fourteen lambs], five [of them] sacrificed two each [making ten], and the remaining [four watches sacrificed] one each. On the third day, [when there was an additional bullock less, so that ten watches were left for fourteen lambs], four [watches] sacrificed two each [making eight], and the remaining [six watches sacrificed] one each. On the fourth day, three (watches) sacrificed two each, and the remaining (eight), one each. On the fifth day, two (watches) sacrificed two each, and the remaining (ten) one each. On the sixth day, one (watch) sacrificed two, and the remaining (twelve) one each. On the seventh, all [the watches] were alike [and they sacrificed an equal number of lambs, each watch sacrificing one. For there were only seven bullocks, two rams, and one goat for ten watches, leaving fourteen lambs for fourteen watches.] On the eighth day, they reverted to the lottery, as on the (other) festivals. [The one bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the eighth day are not sacrificed according to the order of the sacrifices of the (Succoth) festival relative to the order of the watches, but all the watches come and cast lots for them as they do on the other festivals. The order of the lottery is explained in Yoma (2:1).] They [the watch that had sacrificed lambs that day] said: \"He who sacrificed bullocks today shall not do so tomorrow,\" but they took turns.",
            "\tThree times a year (i.e., in the three festivals) all the watches were equal in eimurei haregalim [i.e., \"what was stated\" (amur) concerning the festivals, e.g., the breast and shoulder of the individual festival peace-offerings, the burnt-offerings of the (Temple) visitation burnt-offerings (oloth re'iah), the congregational mussafim, and the goat sin-offerings], and in the distribution of the show bread [when Shabbath fell out on a festival. For on Shabbath the (previous) show bread was removed and a different one arranged, viz. (Leviticus 24:8): \"On the day of Sabbath he shall arrange it.\" On Atzereth (Shevuoth), he is told: \"Here is matzah; here is chametz.\" [When Atzereth falls out on Shabbath, and he (a Cohein) shares in the two breads, which are chametz, and in the show bread, which is matzah — each one is told when he is given his share in the show bread: \"Here is matzah\"; and when he is given his share in the two breads: \"Here is chametz.\" For one offering is not distributed in place of another; but he takes a share from each offering, viz. (Ibid. 7:10): \"To all the sons of Aaron shall it be, one man as well as another.\" Therefore, he is apprised that he is being given his share, whether of chametz or of matzah.] The watch whose time is fixed [to serve on this Shabbath on which the festival falls] sacrifices the temidin, [for they are not for the sake of the festival], vows and gift offerings [of the entire year, which were brought on the festival] and the other congregational offerings, [to include the bullock of \"forgetfulness\" of the congregation and the goats for (atonement of) idolatry, where beth-din erred in their ruling and most of the congregation acted according to their ruling. If these were offered on a festival, the fixed watch sacrifices them.], and he sacrifices everything, [including the (offerings of the) \"summertime of the altar,\" when it (the altar) is idle: When the tamid has been sacrificed and there are no vow or gift-offerings, money is taken from what is left over in the lishkah, beasts for burnt-offerings are bought for it, and they are sacrificed as congregational gift-offerings. These, too, if they are sacrificed on the festival — the fixed watch sacrifices them.] If the festival fell out next to Shabbath — either before or after it — all of the watches were equal in the distribution of the show bread. [If the festival fell out after Shabbath, even though Shabbath was not in the midst of the festival, still, since they had to come on Sabbath eve because of the festival (not being able to come on Shabbath), they shared in the show bread. Likewise, if the eighth day (of Succoth) fell out on Sabbath eve, even though Shabbath was not in the midst of the festival, they shared in the show bread, since they could not leave.]",
            "\tIf it (the festival) fell out so that one day separated them (Shabbath and the festival), the fixed watch takes ten chaloth and the tarrying (watches), two, [i.e., If the first day of the festival fell on Monday, in which instance they (the other watches) could have come on Sunday, and they came earlier, on Friday — or if the last day of the festival fell on Thursday, in which instance they (the incumbent watches) could have left on Friday, and they remained there for Shabbath — all of the tarrying watches take only two chaloth, and the fixed watch takes ten, which are divided between the incoming and the outgoing watch as on all the Sabbaths of the year.] And on the other days of the year, the incoming watch takes six and the outgoing watch takes six. [For the watches change on Shabbath, one performing the morning service; the other, the evening.] R. Yehudah says: The incoming takes seven and the outgoing five. [The incoming takes two additional chaloth for locking the doors, [which the outgoing watch opened in the morning. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] The incoming divide [the breads due them] in the north [so that it be evident to all that they are entering, the north being the prime location, designated for the slaughtering of holy of holies], and the outgoing, in the south [so that it be evident that they are leaving — wherefore they changed their location to one which is not prime.] [The watch of] Bilga always divides in the south, [even upon entering], and its ring is clamped down. [There were twenty-four rings in the azarah at the slaughtering site for the twenty-four priestly watches. The rings of all the watches were open on one end. They were turned upwards, the animal's neck was placed inside, and they were then turned downwards into the ground. The ring of Bilga was clamped down and could not be turned, so that it had to use the rings of others, and it was demeaned thereby], and its window was closed [There were windows in the lishkoth of the (priestly) vestments where they secreted their knives; and the window of the watch of Bilga was closed, the rabbis having penalized it because of a particular episode, viz.: A woman of (i.e., kin to one of) the watch of Bilga, Miriam the daughter of Bilga, became an apostate and married a Greek officer. When the Greeks entered the sanctuary, she went and kicked the altar with her sandal, crying: \"Lukos (\"wolf\" in Greek), Lukos, how long will you (continue) to consume the wealth of Israel and not stand up for them in time of need!\" And when the sages heard of this (after the ascendancy of the Hasmoneans), they clamped down the ring and closed the window to the entire watch of Bilga, saying that if she had not heard her father demeaning the priestly service, she never would have spoken thus. And because of her father they penalized the entire family — \"Woe to the wicked one, and woe to his neighbor! Happy is the righteous one, and happy is his neighbor!\""
