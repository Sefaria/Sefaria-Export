And one which is not ten hand-breadths tall, or does not contain three walls, or whose whose [area of] sun is greater than its shade is invalid. Regarding an old sukkah, Beit Shammai invalidate it, and Beit Hillel validate it. What is an old sukkah? Any [sukkah] which one made it thirty days before the festival. But if one made it for the sake of the festival, even [if he made it] from the beginning of the year, it is valid.", 
            "One who makes his sukkah beneath a tree, it is as though he made it inside a house [and is thus invalid]. Regarding a sukkah on top of a sukkah, the top one is valid, and the bottom one invalid. Rabbi Yehudah says: if there is no lodging in the top one, the bottom one is valid.", 
            "If one spread a sheet over it because of the sun, or beneath it because of the falling leaves, or if one spread [a sheet] over a four-poster [bed, within a sukkah], it is invalid. However, one may spread over a two-poster bed.", 
            "If one raised a grapevine, a gourd, or and ivy upon it, and placed the <i>sekhakh</i> [the leafy roof covering of a sukkah] on top of it, it is invalid. But if there was a greater amount of <i>sekhakh</i> than them, or if one trimmed them [the plants, such that they were not longer attached], it is valid. This is the rule: anything that can be rendered impure or does not grow from the ground cannot be used for <i>sekhakh</i>; and anything that cannot be rendered impure and that grows from the ground can be used for <i>sekhakh</i>.", 
            "Bundles of straw, bundles of wood, or bundles of shoots may not be used for <i>sekhakh</i>. And all of them, if they are untied [from their bundles], are valid. And they are all valid for use as walls [of a sukkah].", 
            "One may use [wooden] planks for <i>sekhakh</i>, according to Rabbi Yehudah. And Rabbi Meir forbids it. If one placed a plank four hand-breadths wide on top [of his sukkah], it is valid, as long as one does not sleep directly beneath it.", 
            "Regarding a ceiling [of planks] that has no plaster on it, Rabbi Yehudah says: Beit Shamai say: one should loosen [the planks], and remove one from between every two [in order to make it a valid sukkah]. And Beit Hillel say: one should either loosen, or remove one from between every two. Rabbi Meir says: one should remove one from between every two, and not loosen them [i.e. loosening does not help].", 
            "One who covers the top of his sukkah with spits or bed slats, if there is space between them as wide as they are [and that space is then filled with valid <i>sekhakh</i>], it is valid. If one digs out a haystack to make a sukkah in it, it is not a [valid] sukkah.", 
            "If [in constructing one's sukkah] one lowers the walls from the top down, if it [the wall] remains three hand-breaths above the ground, it is invalid. If [one raises the walls] from the bottom up, if it rises ten hand-breadths above the ground, it is valid [regardless of any gap between it and the <i>sekhakh</i>]. Rabbi Yose says: just as [a wall built] from the bottom up is [valid provided it has a height of] ten hand-breadths, so too [a wall built] from the top down is [valid provided it has a height of] ten hand-breadths. If one distanced the <i>sekhakh</i> material three hand-breadths from the wall [leaving a gap of at least that size], it is invalid. ", 
            "Regarding a house that [its roof] was breached and one put <i>sekhakh</i> on top [of the breach], if there are four cubits [of empty space or solid ceiling] between the wall and the sekhakh, it is invalid. And similarly regarding a courtyard surrounded by a colonnade, [if one covered the empty space above it, but there is a gap of three hand-breadths between the <i>sekhakh</i> and the walls, it is invalid]. Regarding a large sukkah which [its <i>sekhakh</i>] was surrounded by material that may not be used for <i>sekhakh</i>, if there is an area four cubits wide beneath it [the invalid material], it is invalid.", 
            "If one makes his sukkah like a shed [i.e. with a sloping roof that meets at a line], or leaned it against a wall, Rabbi Eliezer invalidates [both] because it has no roof, and the Sages validate [them]. Regarding a large reed mat, if one made it for lying upon, it may be rendered impure and it cannot be used as <i>sekhakh</i>; if [one made it] for use as <i>sekhakh</i>, it may be used as <i>sekhakh</i> and it cannot be rendered impure. Rabbi Eliezer says: whether it is small or large, if one made it for lying upon, it may be rendered impure and it cannot be used as <i>sekhakh</i>; if [one made it] for use as <i>sekhakh</i>, it may be used as <i>sekhakh</i> and it cannot be rendered impure."

            "\tIf one sleeps under a bed in a succah he has not fulfilled his obligation. [This, if the bed is twenty handbreadths or higher, in which instance it is regarded as a tent, which acts as a partition between himself and the succah. (And the essential mitzvah of succah is eating, drinking, and sleeping therein.)] R. Yehudah said: We used to sleep under the bed before the elders, and they said nothing (in protest). [R. Yehudah holds that a temporary tent does not nullify a permanent one. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] R. Shimon said: Once, Tevi the bondsman of R. Gamliel was sleeping under the bed, and R. Gamliel said to the elders: \"Did you observe Tevi my bondsman? He is a Torah scholar and knows that bondsmen are exempt from the (mitzvah of) succah. [For women are exempt from time-based positive commandments; and (only) those mitzvoth binding upon women are binding upon bondsmen.] Therefore, he is sleeping under the bed.\" And as a matter of course, [even though he was speaking casually, expressing pride in his bondsman], we learned that one who sleeps under the bed (in a succah) has not fulfilled his obligation.", 
            "\tIf one supported his succah on a bedstead, it is kasher. R. Yehudah says: If it cannot stand by itself, it is pasul. [R. Yehudah is consistent with his view that a succah must be a permanent dwelling. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] Succah meduvleleth [one in which he did not place the reeds together, one alongside the other, but one higher and one lower, so that the sun is more than the shade], if its shade is more than its sun, it is kasher. [Our Mishnah apprises us that we perceive it as if they were arranged in order. If in such an instance its shade would be more than its sun, it is kasher.]", 
            "\tIf one makes his succah on top of a wagon [even though it moves and is not fixed in place], or on top of a boat [in the sea, where the wind buffets it], it is kasher. [For it is called a \"dwelling\" so long as it can withstand a normal wind on shore.] And it is permitted to go up to it on the festival. [This is stated (only) because of: \"And it is not permitted to go up to it\" (below)]. (If he makes his succah) on top of a tree, [making a place for it, with partitions and schach], or on top of a camel, it is kasher [on Chol Hamoed]; but it is not permitted to go up to it on the festival, [the rabbis having decreed against going up into a tree and against making use of it, lest he come to tear (from it)]. (If he made) two on a tree, and one by man, [i.e., If he supported most of the floor of the succah on a tree, and built around it two walls on top of the tree and one (man-made) on the ground, joining the floor of the succah to the middle of the wall built on the ground and raising the wall ten handbreadths higher (than the point of juncture)], or two by man and one in on a tree, it is kasher; but it is not permitted to go up to it on the festival. [Since, if it (the one wall on the tree) were removed, the floor of the succah would give, not being able to stand by the support of the ground walls alone, it is not permitted to go up to it on the festival, doing so constituting making use of the tree.] If he made three by man and one on a tree, it is kasher, and it is permitted to go up to it on the festival. This is the rule: Every succah which, if the tree were removed, could stand by itself, is kasher, and it is permitted to go up to it on the festival.", 
            "\tIf one makes his succah between trees, the trees serving as walls for it, it is kasher. [This, on condition that the trees are thick and strong and do not sway back and forth in a normal wind. And he must also fill the spaces between the branches with straw so that the wind not move them. For any partition that cannot withstand a normal wind is not a partition.] \"Messengers of a mitzvah\" are exempt from (the mitzvah of) succah. [For one who is occupied with a mitzvah is exempt from a (different) mitzvah. And not only when he is engaged in the performance of the mitzvah, but even when he is not thus engaged, e.g., as when he is on his way to receive his rabbi or to redeem captives. He is exempt even while resting (on the road).] Those who are ill and their attendants are exempt from succah, [even those who are slightly ill. The rationale for non-performance of a positive commandment of the Torah because of slight illness, or because of the discomfort caused by foul odors or bed bugs or fleas, in which instances one is exempt (from the mitzvah of succah), as well as the rabbis' exempting travelers and keepers of gardens and orchards from succah is (Leviticus 23:42): \"In succoth shall you sit,\" similar to \"shall you dwell.\" For whatever reason one would leave his dwelling, he may also leave his succah. But if one makes his succah ab initio in a place where he is bound to eat or to sleep in discomfort, as in a place where he is in fear of being robbed in his sleep, even if he is not in fear of thieves or robbers while eating — he does not fulfill his succah obligation even when eating, in that the succah does not serve all his needs: eating, drinking, and sleeping. For \"shall you dwell\" must be satisfied, and such a succah fails to satisfy it.] It is permitted to eat and drink \"casually\" outside the succah [a snack to ally one's hunger, with the intent of eating a regular meal (in the succah) afterwards.]", 
            "\tOnce they brought R. Yochanan b. Zakkai a dish to taste and (they brought) to R. Gamliel two dates and a waterskin, and they said: \"Take them up to the succah.\" [Not because it was required, but they were stringent with themselves — whence it is derived that if one is stringent with himself, not to eat even \"casually\" outside the succah, he is to be commended.] And when they gave to R. Tzaddok food less than the size of an egg, [so that he not have to recite the (concluding) blessing [(For, as far as succah is concerned, it has already been stated that one may eat \"casually\" outside the succah — even more than the size of an egg)], he took it in a cloth, ate it outside the succah, and did not recite the concluding blessing.", 
            "\tR. Eliezer says: One must eat fourteen meals in the succah, [two meals each day for seven days], one in the daytime and one at night. And the sages say: There is no set amount. [i.e., If he wishes to eat, he may not eat outside the succah; if he wishes to fast he may do so] — except the first night of the festival alone (when he must eat in the succah), [this being derived (by identity) (Leviticus 23:34): \"On the fifteenth day … is the festival of succoth\" - (Ibid. 6): \"On the fifteenth day,\" in respect to Pesach. Just as the eating of matzah on the first night of Pesach is mandatory, and, on the other days, optional; so, too, in respect to (eating in a) succah.] R. Eliezer said further: If one did not eat (in a succah) the nights of the first festival, he must make it up on the nights of the second festival [i.e., the night of Shemini Atzereth]. The sages say: There is no making it up. Of such (things) it is written (Koheleth 1:15): \"What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted.\" [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer in both instances.]", 
            "\tIf one's head and most of his body were in the succah, and his table in his house — Beth Shammai rule that it is pasul, and Beth Hillel, that it is kasher. [The halachah is in accordance with Beth Shammai, whether it is a large succah and he is sitting at the entrance of the succah with his table in his house, or it is a small succah, which does not accommodate his head and most of his body — both are forbidden — a decree, lest he \"be drawn\" after his table.] Beth Hillel said to Beth Shammai: \"Did it not happen that the elders of Beth Shammai and the elders of Beth Hillel went to visit R. Yochanan b. Hachorani and found him sitting with his head and most of his body in the succah and his table in the house, and they said nothing to him?\" Beth Shammai rejoined: \"Can you offer proof from there? They did, indeed, tell him: 'If this is how you have (always) deported yourself, you have never fulfilled the mitzvah of succah in all of your days!'\"", 
            "\tWomen, bondsmen, and minors are exempt from the (mitzvah of) succah, [it being written (Leviticus 23:42): \"Every citizen in Israel shall sit in succoth\" — to exclude women, who, even though they are obligated in the eating of matzah the first night of Pesach, are not obligated in (the mitzvah of) succah the first night of the festival.] A minor who does not need his mother is obligated in (the mitzvah of) succah. [If he awakes from his sleep and does not call out \"Mother, Mother,\" he is regarded as \"not needing his mother,\" and the mitzvah is binding upon him; otherwise, he is exempt. This is the halachah. And this is the case only if he keeps on calling for his mother and does not stop until she comes. But if he calls once and then stops, he is not regarded as \"needing his mother.\"] Once, when the daughter-in-law of Shammai the elder gave birth, he hollowed part of the ceiling and placed schach over the bed on behalf of the child.", 
            "\tAll seven days (of the festival), one makes his succah permanent and his house temporary, [e.g., If he has beautiful vessels and spreads, he brings them into the succah.] If it rains, when is it permitted to leave (the succah)? When the mikpeh gets spoiled. [Any dish which is neither soft nor hard but stiff (kafui) is called \"mikpeh.\" Most men shun such food, which with (the addition of) a little water is entirely spoiled. And a mikpeh of pounded beans spoils more quickly in a rain than other mikpoth. If there were enough rain to spoil a mikpeh of this kind (were it there), he may leave immediately.] They offered an analogy for this. To what may this be compared? A servant comes to pour a cup (of wine) for his master, and he [the master] dashes the (contents of the) jug in his face, [this, by way of saying: \"I do not want your service!\" Here, too, the rain shows that the Master is not favorably disposed to His servants' deeds.]"

And after the yeush (resignation) of the owners, though he may acquire the lulav with this yeush, still, it is a mitzvah which comes through a transgression (and, therefore, no mitzvah). (and a dried out lulav is pasul), for all (four species) require \"hadar\" (\"beautiful\"), which does not obtain in such an instance.] A lulav from an asheirah [a tree that is worshipped], or from a city gone astray (after idolatry) is pasul, [having to be burned. A lulav must be of a certain size, which these, designated for burning, lack.] If its head were severed, [in which instance it is not hadar] or if its leaves were broken [and held together only by being tied], it is pasul. If its leaves were separated, [i.e., If they were joined on the spine, but inclined in different directions on top, like the branches of a tree], it is kasher. R. Yehudah says: He must tie them on top. [If the leaves became separated, he must tie them so that they rise together with the spine, as (on) other lulavim. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] The palms of Har Habarzel are kasher. [There are palms the leaves of whose lulavim are very short and do not rise along the length of the spine. If they are so long that the head of one reaches the base of the other, they are kasher. A lulav which is three tefachim (handbreadths) long [alongside the hadas, and an additional tefach] in order to shake it [(a lulav requiring \"shaking,\" as explained below)] is kasher. [(\"in order to shake it\":) Read it: \"And in order to shake it\"; that is, a tefach in addition to the three tefachim].",

But they may not be diminished on the festival. [(\"If its head were severed, etc.\":) The halachah is not in accordance with the anonymous Mishnah, but according to R. Tarfon, who says below (3:4) that even if all three were severed, it is kasher. (\"its grapes\":) It has a fruit similar to grapes. (\"If its grapes were more than its leaves, etc.\":) This is so only with black or red grapes; but if they were green, they are one with the hadas, and it is kasher.

And the gemara concludes that R. Yishmael retracted his ruling that three hadasim are required and he permitted even two severed ones. And the same (that it is kasher) would apply if he did not bring them at all, for a severed hadas is considered non-existent.] R. Tarfon says: Even if (all) three were severed, (it is kasher) [\"hadar\" not being required in a hadas. The halachah is in accordance with R. Tarfon.] R.

Of clean terumah — he should not take it; but if he does, it is kasher.

[(\"if it were peeled\":) Only if most of it were peeled; but if part of it, it is kasher. Others say the opposite, viz.: If part of it were peeled, it is pasul; for then it looks \"spotted.\" But if all of it were peeled, it is kasher. \"peeled\" here does  not mean that the skin was removed so that the white could be seen; for in that instance it would be chasser (\"lacking\") and pasul; but that a thin layer was removed and its appearance is green as before. (\"punctured\":) If it were punctured through and through, even a very slight puncture, it is pasul. And if it did not go through and nothing were lost, as when he stuck a thick peg into it — if the hole were as wide as an issar (a Roman coin), it is pasul; if less than that, it is kasher.

R. Yehudah is consistent with his view that a lulav requires a bond, so that if he bound it with something not of its kind there are five species (instead of the prescribed four).

This (the latter) is the probable meaning. And how does he shake it? He moves it forward and back to ward off injurious winds, shaking it three times with each movement; and so with the up and down movements, three times with each movement. ] And (he shakes it) at \"I pray You, O L rd, save, I pray.\" These are the word of Beth Hillel.

Yehoshua when all the people were shaking their lulavim, and they shook them only at \"I pray You, O L rd, save, I pray.\" [And the halachah here is only in accordance with Beth Hillel.] If one were on the road and had no lulav to take, when he comes home, he takes it at his table.

When the Temple was destroyed, R. Yochanan b. Zakkai decreed that the lulav be taken in the province seven days in remembrance of the Temple and that the day of \"hanef\" [the waving of the omer, i.e., the sixteenth of Nissan] be entirely forbidden. [In the time of the Temple, after the omer offering, they would eat chadash (new produce) on that day, it being written (Leviticus 23:14): \"…until you have brought the offering of your G d.\" And when the Temple was destroyed, it was permitted at first light, one verse reading (Ibid.): \"until this self-same day,\" implying (that chadash may not be eaten) until first light, and another: \"until you have brought the offering.\" How is this to be reconciled? When the omer obtains (i.e., when there is a Temple), \"until you have brought.\" When the omer does not obtain, \"until this self-same day.\" And R. Yochanan b. Zakkai forbade the entire day to them by reason of: \"The Temple will speedily be rebuilt, and they will say: 'Last year, did we not eat (chadash) at first light? This year, we shall do so, too.'\"]",

Therefore, they would bring their lulavim there from Sabbath eve.] The next day, they rise early and come (to the synagogue). Everyone recognizes his own and takes it. For the sages have said: One does not fulfill his obligation on the first day of the festival with his neighbor's lulav, [it being written (Leviticus 23:40): \"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day.\" And if his neighbor gives it to him as a gift, even on condition that he return it, it is a bona fide gift, and he takes it and fulfills his obligation with it and then returns it. And if he does not return it, it is seen retroactively that it had been stolen by him to begin with — in which instance he has not fulfilled his obligation.] And the other days of the festival, one does fulfill his obligation with his neighbor's lulav.", 
            "\tR. Yossi says: If the first day of the festival fell out on Shabbath, and he forgot and took out his lulav to the public domain, he is not liable (for a sin-offering), having taken it out under (Torah) sanction. [This, in an instance where he had not yet fulfilled his obligation of taking the lulav at the time he took it out. But if he had fulfilled his obligation beforehand, he is liable, not being occupied thenceforward in the performance of a mitzvah. But how is it possible that he had not fulfilled his obligation before he took it out? Had he not fulfilled it (automatically) the very moment he picked it up! (The answer:) Such an instance does obtain if he inverted it; for a man has not fulfilled his obligation in respect to all mitzvoth (of this kind) unless he performs them (handling them, e.g., lulav, hadas), in the direction of their growth, viz. (Exodus 26:15): \"standing shittim wood\" — standing in the direction of their growth. Or else, (the instance is one in which) he took it out in a vessel. For taking it \"demeaningly\" through something else is not called \"taking.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.]",

On the festival water may be added (but it may not be replaced with colder water, this constituting \"exertion to amend something\"], and on Chol Hamoed (the intermediate days), it is [a mitzvah] to change the water.

(Ibid. 27:7): \"and you shall slaughter peace-offerings, and you shall eat them there, and you shall rejoice.\"] Succah [sitting in the succah] and the water libation [at the morning temidim of the festival] — seven.

[If the first day of the festival falls out on any of the weekdays, so that Shabbath falls out on Chol Hamoed, it does not override. And even though all seven days obtain in the Temple by Torah law, the sages established their decree (against taking the lulav) for the other days of the festival, since they have no Torah basis (for taking the lulav) in the borders (on those days). And, in truth, even today the taking of the lulav should override Shabbath on the first day of the festival; but because we are not expert in the fixing of the New Moon, so that it (that day) may not be the first day of the festival, we do not override the Sabbath on the basis of a possibility. And in taking it, there is no (Torah proscribed) Sabbath labor, but merely the moving of it. (Still, it is forbidden) lest he take it in his hand and go to an expert to learn the blessing or the order of the shakings (na'anuim) and come to carry it four cubits in the public domain.

In keeping with this, they instituted that on the seventh day, in the Temple, aravah override Sabbath (for they would circle the altar with the aravah.) And today, it is only a custom of the prophets, who had the people take the aravah on the seventh day (Hoshanah Rabbah) aside from the aravah in the lulav (and no blessing is made over it.)]",

[The square of the Temple Mount was surrounded with itztevaoth (colonnades) where people would sit, and which were covered on top against the rain.] And the elders, [who were worried about being jostled when they came the next day to get their lulavim] would leave theirs in the lishkah. And they [beth-din] taught them [all of the people] to say: \"If someone else gets my lulav, it is his as a gift\" [so that it not be in a status of \"stolen\" or \"borrowed\" by him.] The next day they would rise early and come, and the sextons would throw them (the lulavim) before them. They would grab at them (trying to get their own) and would come to blows. When beth-din saw that there was danger in this, they instituted that each one take his own lulav in his house.",

Aravoth are plentiful there. It is but a small distance from Jerusalem. \"Kalanya\" means \"free from taxation,\" for which reason it was also called \"Motza,\" \"released\" from royal taxation because of the aravoth that were taken from there.] They would go down there and pick young aravoth and come and stand them on the sides of the altar with their heads bent. They would sound (on the shofar) tekiah, teruah, tekiah. Every day (of the festival) they would circle the altar once, saying: \"I pray, You, O L rd, (\"Ana Hashem\"), save, I pray\"; \"I pray You, O L rd, prosper, I pray.\" R. Yehudah says: \"Ani, Veho, save, I pray.\" [(\"Ani Veho\":) the gematria (numerical equivalent) of \"Ana Hashem.\" Also, they are two of the names (of the L rd) in the seventy-two name formulation (Exodus 14:19-21). Another interpretation: I (ani) and He (ho) are in affliction,\" as in (Psalms 91:15): \"I am with him in affliction,\" \"save, I pray.\"] And on that day (the seventh) they would circle the altar seven times. When they take leave (of the altar), what do they say? \"This beauty is for you, O altar; this beauty is for you, O altar!\" R. Eliezer says: \"To Him and to you, O altar; to Him and to you, O altar!\"",

Another interpretation: The children would cast away their lulavim and eat their ethrogim on the seventh day.

R. Yehudah says: They were of lime, but their surface was blackened because of the wine (poured therein) [so that they looked like silver, which is darker than lime.] And they had outlets [one to each] like two thin snouts, one (relatively) thick (for the wine); the other, (relatively) thin (for the water), so that both (the wine and the water) reach the bottom at the same time. [(\"like two thin snouts\":) the Cohein would stir (the contents) in the mouth of the basins, and the libations would descend through the spouts upon the roof of the altar, where there was a duct whereby the water and the wine descended to the shittin (a pit by the side of the altar), which was hollow and very deep. (\"one, thick; the other, thin\":) One of the snouts (the wine snout) was thick; and one, (the water snout) was thin. This, so that they (the wine and the water) reach the bottom at the same time. For water flows more quickly than wine, which is thicker, and slower. Thus, the wine snout was made thicker (i.e., wider) than the water snout, so that they reach the bottom at the same time.] The western basin was for water, and the eastern one for wine. If he poured the wine into the water basin or the water into the wine basin, he has still fulfilled his obligation. R. Yehudah says: With one log he performed the libation all eight (days). [He differs with the first tanna in both, three logs and seven days, R. Yehudah saying (only one log, and that) the libation obtains on the eighth day, too. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] And the one performing the libation is told: \"Hold your hand high!\" [so that we can see if you pour water into the basin (for the Sadducees do not acknowledge the water libation to be a mitzvah)]. For once, one [Sadducee] poured [the water] upon his feet, and all the people \"stoned\" him with their ethrogim.",

For a ministering vessel consecrates (what is in it), as it is written (Leviticus 30:29): \"Everything that touches them shall be consecrated\"; and everything which becomes consecrated in itself becomes pasul by remaining overnight.] And they would place it in the lishkah. If it (the water) spilled out or became exposed, they would fill it up from the laver [And even though the laver is likened to a ministering vessel and consecrates its water, it did not become pasul by remaining overnight; for they would sink it in a well in the evening, as stated in Yoma (3:10): \"And he also made a muchni for the laver (a wheel to sink it into a well) so that its water not be rendered unfit by standing overnight.\"], for exposed wine or water are unfit for the altar.

These, too, if they are sacrificed on the festival — the fixed watch sacrifices them.] If the festival fell out next to Shabbath — either before or after it — all of the watches were equal in the distribution of the show bread. [If the festival fell out after Shabbath, even though Shabbath was not in the midst of the festival, still, since they had to come on Sabbath eve because of the festival (not being able to come on Shabbath), they shared in the show bread.

When the Greeks entered the sanctuary, she went and kicked the altar with her sandal, crying: \"Lukos (\"wolf\" in Greek), Lukos, how long will you (continue) to consume the wealth of Israel and not stand up for them in time of need!\" And when the sages heard of this (after the ascendancy of the Hasmoneans), they clamped down the ring and closed the window to the entire watch of Bilga, saying that if she had not heard her father demeaning the priestly service, she never would have spoken thus.
