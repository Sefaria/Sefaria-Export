            "<b>A <i>sukka</i>,</b> i.e., its roofing, which is the main and most crucial element of the mitzva, <b>that is more than twenty cubits high is unfit. Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit.</b> Similarly, a <i>sukka</i> <b>that is not</b> even <b>ten handbreadths high, and</b> one <b>that does not have three walls, and</b> one <b>whose sunlight</b> that passes through its roofing <b>is greater than its shade are unfit.</b> With regard to <b>an old <i>sukka</i>, Beit Shammai deem it unfit</b> for the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> <b>and Beit Hillel deem it fit. And which is</b> considered <b>an old <i>sukka</i>?</b> It is <b>any</b> booth <b>that one established thirty days</b> or more <b>prior to the Festival</b> without expressly designating that it was for the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. In that case, the assumption is that he constructed it for some other purpose. <b>However, if he established it</b> expressly <b>for the sake of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>even</b> if he constructed it <b>at the beginning of the</b> previous <b>year, it is fit</b> for use in the fulfillment of the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, even according to Beit Shammai.",
            "With regard to <b>one who establishes his <i>sukka</i> beneath a tree,</b> it is <b>as though he established it inside the house</b> and it is unfit. If one established <b>a <i>sukka</i> atop</b> another <b><i>sukka</i>, the upper</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit and the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit. Rabbi Yehuda says: If there are no residents in the upper</b> <i>sukka</i>, <b>the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit.</b>",
            "If <b>one spread a sheet over</b> the roofing as protection for those sitting in the <i>sukka</i> <b>due to the sun, or</b> if one spread a sheet <b>beneath</b> the roofing as protection <b>due to the falling leaves, or</b> if <b>one spread</b> a sheet as a canopy <b>over the</b> frame of <b>a four-post [<i>kinof</i>]</b> bed, the area in the <i>sukka</i> beneath the sheets is <b>unfit.</b> In the first two cases, because the sheet is susceptible to ritual impurity, it renders the otherwise fit roofing unfit. In the case of the canopy, one is not sitting under the roofing of the <i>sukka</i>; rather, he is sitting inside a tent. <b>However, one</b> may <b>spread</b> the sheet <b>over</b> the frame of <b>a two-post [<i>naklitei</i>] bed,</b> which has one post in the middle of each end of the bed. When spreading the sheet over the posts it forms an inclined rather than a flat roof, and a tent with an inclined roof is not considered a significant structure.",
            "If <b>one trellised</b> climbing plants such as <b>a grapevine, or gourd</b> plant, <b>or ivy [<i>kissos</i>], over</b> a <i>sukka</i> while they were still attached to the ground, <b>and</b> then added <b>roofing atop them,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit. If</b> the amount of fit <b>roofing was greater</b> than the plants attached to the ground, <b>or if he cut</b> the climbing plants so that they were no longer attached to the ground, <b>it is fit.</b> <b>This is the principle</b> with regard to the roofing of a <i>sukka</i>: <b>Anything that is susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> e.g., vessels, <b>or its growth is not from the ground,</b> e.g., animal hides, <b>one may not roof</b> his <i>sukka</i> <b>with it. And anything that is not susceptible to ritual impurity and its growth is from the ground, one may roof</b> his <i>sukka</i> <b>with it.</b>",
            "<b>One</b> may <b>not roof</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with bundles of straw</b> tied with rope, <b>or bundles of wood, or bundles of twigs. And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> the bundles, <b>if one untied them,</b> they are <b>fit</b> for use in roofing the <i>sukka</i>, as their lack of fitness is due to the fact that the bundles are tied. <b>And</b> even when tied, <b>all of</b> the bundles are <b>fit for</b> use in constructing the <b>walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i>.",
            "<b>One</b> may <b>roof</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with boards</b> like those used in the ceiling of a house; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir prohibits</b> their use. <b>If one placed a board that is four handbreadths wide atop</b> the <i>sukka</i>, the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit.</b> He fulfills his obligation, <b>provided he does not sleep beneath</b> the board.",
            "In the case of <b>a roof</b> made of boards that are four handbreadths wide <b>upon which there is no</b> coat of <b>plaster, Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to the manner in which to render it fit. <b>Beit Shammai say: One moves</b> each board, and then it is considered as though he placed the board there for the sake of the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, <b>and one</b> then <b>removes one</b> board <b>from among</b> the boards and replaces it with fit roofing. <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> One need not perform both actions; rather, <b>one</b> must either <b>move</b> the boards <b>or remove one from among</b> them. <b>Rabbi Meir says: One</b> only <b>removes one from among</b> them <b>and does not move</b> the others.",
            "In the case of <b>one who roofs his <i>sukka</i> with</b> metal <b>skewers or with the long boards of the bed,</b> which compose its frame, <b>if there is space between</b> each one of <b>them equal to</b> the width of the skewers or the boards, and if he places fit roofing in those spaces, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit.</b> In the case of <b>one who hollows out</b> and creates a space inside <b>a stack of grain,</b> it is <b>not a <i>sukka</i>.</b>",
            "<b>One who lowers the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i> <b>from up downward, if</b> the lower edge of the wall is <b>three handbreadths above the ground,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b> Since animals can enter through that space, it is not the wall of a fit <i>sukka</i>. However, if one constructs the wall from <b>down upward, if</b> the wall is <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> even if it does not reach the roofing, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit. Rabbi Yosei says: Just as</b> a wall built <b>from down upward</b> must be <b>ten handbreadths, so too,</b> in a case where one lowers the wall <b>from up downward,</b> it must be <b>ten handbreadths</b> in length. Regardless of its height off the ground, it is the wall of a fit <i>sukka</i>, as the legal status of a ten-handbreadth partition is that of a full-fledged partition in all areas of <i>halakha</i>. If <b>one distanced the roofing from the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i> at <b>a distance of three handbreadths</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit,</b> because three handbreadths of open space, even adjacent to the walls, render the <i>sukka</i> unfit.",
            "In the case of <b>a house that was breached,</b> creating a hole in the middle of the roof, <b>and one roofed over</b> the breach, <b>if from the wall to the roofing there are four</b> or more <b>cubits</b> of the remaining original roof, <b>it is an unfit</b> <i>sukka</i>. If the roofing is less than four cubits from the wall, the <i>sukka</i> is fit, based on the principle of curved wall; the remaining intact ceiling is considered an extension of the vertical wall. <b>And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>a courtyard that is surrounded</b> on three sides <b>by a portico,</b> which has a roof but no walls, if one placed roofing over the courtyard between the different sides of the portico and the roof of the portico is four cubits wide, the <i>sukka</i> is unfit. Similarly, <b>a large <i>sukka</i> that was surrounded</b> at the edge of its roofing <b>with material with which one</b> may <b>not roof</b> a <i>sukka</i>, e.g., vessels susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>if there are four cubits beneath</b> the unfit roofing, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b> The principle of curved wall does not apply to unfit roofing that measures four cubits or more.",
            "<b>One who establishes his <i>sukka</i> like a type of circular hut,</b> with no roof whose walls slope down from the center <b>or who rested</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>against the wall,</b> by taking long branches and placing one end on the ground and leaning the other end against the wall to establish a structure with no roof, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems it unfit because it does not have a roof, and the Rabbis deem it fit;</b> as, in their opinion, the roof and the walls may be a single entity, indistinguishable from each other. In the case of <b>a large mat of reeds,</b> if <b>one</b> initially <b>produced it for</b> the purpose of <b>lying</b> upon it, <b>it is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> like any other vessel, <b>and</b> therefore <b>one</b> may <b>not roof</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with it.</b> If one initially produced it <b>for roofing, one</b> may <b>roof</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with it, and it is not susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> as its legal status is not that of a vessel. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that the distinction between mats is based on use, not size. Therefore, with regard to <b>both a small</b> mat <b>and a large</b> mat, if <b>one produced it for</b> the purpose of <b>lying</b> upon it, <b>it is susceptible to ritual impurity and one</b> may <b>not roof</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with it.</b> If one produced it <b>for roofing, one</b> may <b>roof</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with it, and it is not susceptible to ritual impurity.</b>"

            "<b>One who sleeps beneath the bed in the <i>sukka</i> did not fulfill his obligation,</b> because the bed constitutes a tent that serves as a barrier between him and the roofing of the <i>sukka</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: It was our custom that we would sleep beneath the bed before the Elders and they did not say anything to us</b> to the effect that we are not fulfilling our obligation. Apparently, the halakhic status of the bed is not like that of a tent and it does not prevent fulfillment of the mitzva. § <b>Rabbi Shimon said,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>There was an incident involving Tavi, the</b> Canaanite <b>slave of Rabban Gamliel, who was sleeping beneath the bed, and Rabban Gamliel</b> lightheartedly <b>said to the Elders:</b> Did <b>you see my slave Tavi, who is a Torah scholar and knows that slaves are exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>?</b> Since it is a positive, time-bound mitzva, Canaanite slaves, whose status with regard to this halakhic category is like that of women, are exempt from the obligation to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. <b>Therefore, he sleeps under the bed.</b> Rabbi Shimon continued: <b>And by the way,</b> as Rabban Gamliel was not issuing a halakhic ruling, <b>we learned that one who sleeps beneath the bed did not fulfill his obligation.</b>",
            "<b>One who supports his <i>sukka</i> on the legs of the bed,</b> i.e., he leans the <i>sukka</i> roofing on a bed, the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>cannot stand in and of itself</b> without support of the bed, <b>it is unfit.</b> <b>A <i>sukka</i> that is <i>meduvlelet</i> and whose shade exceeds its sunlight is fit.</b> A <i>sukka</i> whose roofing <b>is thick like a house of sorts, even though</b> it is so thick <b>that the stars cannot be seen from within it, is fit.</b>",
            "In the case of <b>one who establishes his <i>sukka</i> at the top of the wagon or at the top of the ship,</b> although it is portable it <b>is fit,</b> as it is sufficient for a <i>sukka</i> to be a temporary residence. <b>And one</b> may <b>ascend</b> and enter <b>it</b> even <b>on</b> the first <b>Festival</b> day. In the case of one who establishes his <i>sukka</i> <b>at</b> the <b>top of a tree or atop a camel,</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit, but one may not ascend</b> and enter <b>it on</b> the first <b>Festival</b> day because the Sages prohibit climbing or using trees or animals on the Festival. If <b>two</b> of the walls of the <i>sukka</i> are <b>in the tree and one</b> is established on the ground <b>by a person,</b> or if <b>two</b> are established on the ground <b>by a person and one</b> is <b>in the tree,</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit, but one may not ascend</b> and enter <b>it on</b> the first <b>Festival</b> day because it is prohibited to use the tree. However, if <b>three</b> of the walls are established on the ground <b>by a person and one</b> is <b>in the tree,</b> then since it contains the minimum number of walls required, it <b>is fit, and one may enter it on</b> the first <b>Festival</b> day. The mishna summarizes that <b>this is the principle: Any</b> case <b>where,</b> were <b>the tree removed, the</b> <i>sukka</i> would <b>be able to remain standing in and of itself,</b> it <b>is fit, and one may ascend</b> and enter <b>it on</b> the <b>Festival,</b> since the tree is not its primary support.",
            "mishna In the case of <b>one who establishes his <i>sukka</i> between the trees, and the trees</b> serve as <b>walls for it,</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit.</b> <b>Those on the path</b> to perform <b>a mitzva are exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>.</b> The <b>ill and their caretakers are exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>. One</b> may <b>eat and drink</b> in the framework of a <b>casual</b> meal <b>outside the <i>sukka</i>.</b>",
            "Apropos eating in the <i>sukka</i>, which is discussed in the previous mishna, this mishna relates: <b>An incident</b> occurred where <b>they brought a cooked dish to Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b> for him <b>to taste, and to Rabban Gamliel</b> they brought <b>two dates and a bucket of water. And they</b> each <b>said: Take them up to the <i>sukka</i></b> and we will eat them there. In contrast, the mishna relates: <b>And when they gave Rabbi Tzadok less than an egg-bulk of food, he took</b> the food <b>in a cloth</b> for cleanliness; he did not wash his hands because in his opinion, one is not required to wash his hands before eating less than an egg-bulk. <b>And he ate it outside the <i>sukka</i> and did not recite a blessing after</b> eating <b>it.</b> He holds that one is not required to recite a blessing after eating less than an egg-bulk, as it is not satisfying, and it is written: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Gemara will explain the halakhic rationale for each of these actions described.",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person is obligated to eat fourteen meals in the <i>sukka</i></b> over the course of the seven days of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>one during the day</b> each day <b>and one at night</b> each night. <b>And the Rabbis say: There is no quota</b> for the number of meals, and one may choose whether or not to eat any of the meals <b>except for the</b> meal on the <b>evening of the first Festival</b> day <b>of <i>Sukkot</i>,</b> which one is required to eat in the <i>sukka</i>. <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer said: One who did not eat</b> a meal on the <b>evening of the first day</b> of the Festival should <b>compensate</b> with a meal on the <b>evening of the last day of the Festival,</b> on the Eighth Day of Assembly, despite the fact that he will not eat it in the <i>sukka</i>. <b>And the Rabbis say: There is no compensation for</b> this <b>matter, and with regard to</b> similar cases where it is impossible to rectify failure to fulfill a positive mitzva, <b>it is stated: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15).",
            "In the case of <b>one whose head and most of his</b> body <b>were in the <i>sukka</i> and his table was in the house, Beit Shammai deem it unfit, and Beit Hillel deem it fit. Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai:</b> And <b>wasn’t there an incident where the Elders of Beit Shammai and the Elders of Beit Hillel went to visit Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit and they found him</b> such <b>that he was sitting with his head and most of his</b> body <b>in the <i>sukka</i> and his table in the house, and they said nothing to him?</b> Even Beit Shammai did not object. <b>Beit Shammai said to them:</b> Is there <b>proof from there?</b> That is not what happened; rather, <b>they said to him: If you were accustomed</b> to act in <b>this</b> manner, <b>you have never fulfilled the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> in your life.</b>",
            "The mishna continues: <b>Women, slaves, and minors are exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>. A minor who does not need his mother</b> any longer <b>is obligated</b> in the mitzva. There was <b>an incident where the daughter-in-law of Shammai the Elder gave birth</b> just before <i>Sukkot</i>, and Shammai <b>removed the</b> coat of <b>plaster</b> from the roof, leaving the beams, <b>and roofed</b> with the beams <b>over the bed for the</b> newborn <b>minor.</b>",
            "<b>All seven days</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>a person renders his <i>sukka</i></b> his <b>permanent</b> residence <b>and his house</b> his <b>temporary</b> residence. If <b>rain fell, from when is it permitted to vacate</b> the <i>sukka</i>? It is permitted <b>from</b> the point that it is raining so hard <b>that the congealed dish will spoil.</b> The Sages <b>told a parable: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a servant who comes to pour wine for his master, and he pours a jug [<i>kiton</i>] of water in his face</b> to show him that his presence is not desired. So too, in the <i>sukka</i>, rain is an indication that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not want the person to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>."

The sixteen offerings mentioned above were divided among sixteen priestly watches, one offering per watch. <b>Fourteen sheep remained to</b> be divided among the <b>eight</b> remaining <b>watches.

On the third</b> day of the Festival, when eleven bulls were sacrificed, fourteen of the priestly watches sacrifice the bulls, rams, and goat, <b>four</b> of the remaining watches <b>sacrifice two</b> sheep <b>each, and the remaining</b> six watches sacrifice <b>one</b> sheep <b>each.</b> <b>On the fourth</b> day of the Festival, when ten bulls were sacrificed, thirteen of the priestly watches sacrifice the bulls, rams, and goat, <b>three</b> of the remaining watches <b>sacrifice two</b> sheep <b>each, and the remaining</b> eight watches sacrifice <b>one</b> sheep <b>each. On the fifth</b> day, when nine bulls were sacrificed, twelve watches sacrifice the bulls, rams, and goat, <b>two</b> of the twelve remaining watches <b>sacrifice two</b> sheep <b>each, and the remaining</b> ten watches sacrifice <b>one</b> sheep <b>each. On the sixth</b> day, when eight bulls were sacrificed, eleven watches sacrifice the bulls, rams, and goat, <b>one</b> of the remaining watches <b>sacrifices two</b> sheep, <b>and the remaining</b> twelve watches sacrifice <b>one</b> sheep <b>each.</b> <b>On the seventh</b> day <b>they are all equal</b> and bring one offering each. <b>On the eighth</b> day, when there was a completely different configuration of offerings, <b>they returned to the</b> standard <b>lottery</b> system used to determine which of the priestly watches would sacrifice the offerings, <b>as</b> they did <b>on the other pilgrimage Festivals,</b> which do not have as many offerings as does <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>They said</b> about the ordering of the priestly watches: <b>One who sacrificed bulls today will not sacrifice</b> bulls <b>tomorrow; rather,</b> they will sacrifice one of the other types of offerings. <b>They rotate,</b> so that each of the watches will have the opportunity to sacrifice bulls as well as other animals.",
            "<b>At three times during the year, all</b> twenty-four <b>priestly watches</b> have <b>equal</b> status, in that all receive a share in the Temple service independent of the standard order of the watches and all receive a share in the accompanying gifts of the priesthood: <b>In the portions of the offerings of the Festivals</b> sacrificed on the altar <b>and in the distribution of the shewbread</b> on Shabbat during the Festivals. <b>On <i>Shavuot</i></b> that coincides with Shabbat, when the two loaves offered on <i>Shavuot</i> would be distributed together with the distribution of the shewbread, the priest charged with the distribution <b>says to</b> each priest: <b>Here is <i>matza</i></b> from the shewbread <b>for you,</b> and <b>here is leavened bread</b> from the two loaves <b>for you.</b> The principle is that <b>the priestly watch whose time is fixed</b> during the Festival <b>sacrifices</b> the <b>daily offerings</b> during the Festival, as well as vow-offerings, <b>free-will offerings, and all other communal offerings. And</b> that watch <b>sacrifices all of them</b> even during the Festival, when other aspects of the service are shared by all the watches.

            "<b>If one day happened to separate between</b> the Festival and Shabbat, <b>the watch whose time was scheduled would take ten</b> of the twelve <b>loaves</b> of shewbread, <b>and</b> the watch <b>that was detained</b> after the Festival because there was insufficient time to get home before Shabbat <b>takes two</b> loaves. <b>And during the rest of the days of the year,</b> when the changing of the watches takes place on Shabbat, <b>the incoming</b> watch <b>takes six</b> loaves <b>and the outgoing</b> watch <b>takes six</b> loaves. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The incoming</b> watch <b>takes seven</b> loaves <b>and the outgoing takes five.</b> The standard procedure was that the members of <b>the incoming</b> watch <b>divide</b> the shewbread <b>in the north</b> section of the courtyard, <b>and the outgoing</b> watch <b>in the south.</b> However, there was one exception: The watch of <b>Bilga,</b> due to a penalty imposed upon it, <b>always divides</b> the shewbread to its members <b>in the south,</b> even when it is the incoming watch. <b>And its ring</b> used to facilitate slaughter of the animals <b>was fixed</b> in place, rendering it useless, <b>and its niche</b> among the niches in the wall of the Chamber of Knives, where the priests would store their knives and other vessels, was <b>sealed.</b>"
