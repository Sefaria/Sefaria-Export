            "The standing men used to fast four times in the week; viz., from Monday until Thursday (inclusive), but they did not fast on Friday, on account of the honor due the Sabbath, nor on Sunday, that they might not (too suddenly) pass over from rest and pleasure to weariness and fasting--for that might endanger their lives. On Sunday the standing men read (the sections commencing): 'In the beginning,' etc. (Genesis 1:1-5), and, 'Let there be an expansion,' etc. (Genesis 1:6)"
