            "The acts of <b>carrying out</b> from a public domain into a private domain or vice versa, which are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> are primarily <b>two</b> basic actions <b>that comprise four</b> cases from the perspective of a person <b>inside</b> a private domain, <b>and two</b> basic actions <b>that comprise four</b> cases from the perspective of a person <b>outside,</b> in a public domain. The mishna elaborates: <b>How</b> do these eight cases take place? In order to answer that question, the mishna cites cases involving a poor person and a homeowner. <b>The poor</b> person <b>stands outside,</b> in the public domain, <b>and the homeowner stands inside,</b> in the private domain. <b>The poor person</b> lifted an object in the public domain, <b>extended his hand into</b> the private domain, <b>and placed</b> the object <b>into the hand of the homeowner.</b> In that case, the poor person performed the prohibited labor of carrying from the public domain into the private domain in its entirety. <b>Or,</b> the poor person reached his hand into the private domain, <b>took</b> an item from the hand of the homeowner, <b>and carried</b> it <b>out</b> into the public domain. In that case, the poor person performed the prohibited labor of carrying out from the private domain into the public domain in its entirety. In both of these cases, because <b>the poor person</b> performed the prohibited labor in its entirety, he <b>is liable and the homeowner is exempt.</b> The mishna cites two additional cases. In these, the prohibited labor is performed by the homeowner, who is in the private domain: <b>The homeowner</b> lifted an item in the private domain, <b>extended his hand into</b> the public domain, <b>and placed</b> the object <b>into the hand of the poor person.</b> In that case, the homeowner performed the labor of carrying out from the private domain into the public domain in its entirety. <b>Or,</b> the homeowner reached his hand into the public domain, <b>took</b> an object <b>from</b> the hand of the poor person, <b>and carried</b> it <b>into</b> the private domain. In that case, the homeowner performed the labor of carrying from the public domain into the private domain in its entirety. In both of those cases, because <b>the homeowner</b> performed the prohibited labor in its entirety, he <b>is liable and the poor person is exempt.</b> There are four additional cases where neither the homeowner nor the poor person performed the labor in its entirety, and therefore neither is liable: <b>The poor person extended his hand into</b> the private domain <b>and</b> either <b>the homeowner took</b> an object <b>from</b> his hand and placed it in the private domain <b>or</b> the homeowner <b>placed</b> an object <b>into</b> the hand of the poor person, and the poor person <b>carried</b> the object <b>out</b> into the public domain. In those cases and the two that follow, the act of transferring the object from one domain to another was performed jointly by two people, the poor person and the homeowner. Because each performed only part of the prohibited labor, <b>both of them are exempt.</b> So too, in a case where <b>the homeowner extended his hand into the public domain and,</b> either <b>the poor person took</b> an object <b>from</b> the homeowner’s hand and placed it in the public domain <b>or the poor person placed</b> an object <b>into</b> the homeowner’s hand and the homeowner <b>carried</b> the object <b>into</b> the private domain. Because each performed only part of the prohibited labor, <b>both of them are exempt.</b>",
            "After having dealt with the limited and defined topic of the <i>halakhot</i> of carrying out on Shabbat, the mishna begins to deal with the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat chronologically, beginning with activities that one may not perform prior to the onset of Shabbat. With regard to one’s daily conduct, the mishna says: <b>A person may not sit before the barber adjacent to</b> the time of <b><i>minḥa</i> until he recites</b> the afternoon <b>prayer. And a person may not enter the bathhouse and may not</b> enter <b>to</b> work in <b>a tannery</b> [<b><i>burseki</i></b>]. <b>And</b> he may <b>neither</b> begin <b>to eat</b> a meal <b>nor to</b> sit in <b>judgment</b> until he prays. <b>And</b> however, <b>if they</b> already <b>began</b> engaging in those activities, <b>they need not stop</b> and recite the <i>Amida</i> prayer. The <i>tanna</i> articulated a principle: <b>One stops</b> engaging in all of these activities <b>to recite <i>Shema</i> and one does not stop to</b> recite the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer.</b>",
            "This mishna deals with various decrees, especially with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, which were issued in order to distance a person from transgressions that he is liable to commit through habit and routine. The mishna said: <b>The tailor may not go out</b> with <b>his needle adjacent to nightfall</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>lest he forget</b> that he is carrying the needle <b>and go out</b> with it to the public domain even after Shabbat begins. <b>And,</b> similarly, <b>the scribe</b> [<b><i>lavlar</i></b>] may <b>not</b> go out <b>with his quill</b>[<b><i>kulmos</i>]</b> for the same reason. <b>And</b> one <b>may not shake his clothes</b> on Shabbat to rid them of lice; <b>and</b> one <b>may not read</b> a book <b>by candlelight,</b> so that he will not come to adjust the wick of the lamp. However, <b>in truth they said</b> an established <i>halakha</i>: The <b>attendant sees where</b> in the book the <b>children</b> under his supervision are <b>reading</b> in the Torah, even by candlelight on Shabbat. <b>However, he</b> himself <b>may not read. Similarly,</b> the Sages issued a similar decree with regard to other <i>halakhot</i>, as they said: <b>The <i>zav</i> may not eat</b> even <b>with</b> his wife <b>the <i>zava,</i></b> despite the fact that they are both ritually impure, <b>because,</b> by eating together, they will come to excessive intimacy and become <b>accustomed to sin.</b>",
            "<b>And these are among the <i>halakhot</i> that</b> the Sages, <b>who went up to visit him, said in the upper story of Ḥananya ben Ḥizkiya ben Garon.</b> The precise nature of these <i>halakhot</i> will be explained in the Gemara. These <i>halakhot</i> are considered one unit because they share a distinctive element. Since many Sages were there, among them most of the generation’s Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael, they engaged in discussion of various <i>halakhot</i> of the Torah. It turned out that when the people expressing opinions <b>were counted,</b> the students of <b>Beit Shammai outnumbered</b> the students of <b>Beit Hillel, and they issued decrees</b> with regard to <b>eighteen matters on that day</b> in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai.",
            "In this mishna there is a fundamental dispute between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai: Must one begin refraining from actions prohibited on Shabbat on Shabbat eve? Or, may one initiate an action prior to Shabbat, even if he knows that it will continue on its own on Shabbat itself? These are the details of that dispute: <b>Beit Shammai say: One may only soak</b> dry <b>ink</b> in water <b>and</b> dry plants, which produce <b>dyes,</b> in water <b>and vetch</b> for animal food to soften them in water on Shabbat eve, adjacent to Shabbat,<b>if</b> there is clearly <b>sufficient time for them to soak</b> for their designated purpose <b>while it is still day,</b> before Shabbat begins, and their continued soaking on Shabbat will have no effect. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: One may only place bundles of</b> combed <b>flax inside the oven</b> on Shabbat eve if there is sufficient time <b>so that they will be heated while it is still day. And</b> one may <b>only</b> place <b>wool into the</b> dyer’s <b>kettle if</b> there is <b>sufficient time for</b> the wool <b>to absorb the dye</b> while it is still day. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may spread traps</b> for an <b>animal and birds and fish only</b> if there is sufficient time remaining in the day <b>for them to be trapped</b> in them <b>while it is still day, and Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so even if there is not sufficient time remaining in the day.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: One may only sell</b> an item <b>to a gentile</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and</b> one <b>may only load</b> a burden on his donkey <b>with him, and</b> one <b>may only lift</b> a burden <b>on him if</b> there remains <b>sufficient time for</b> the gentile <b>to arrive to a near place</b> prior to Shabbat, and the Jew will play no role in the performance of a prohibited labor by the gentile on Shabbat. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so.",
            "<b>Beit Shammai say: One may not give skins to a</b> gentile <b>tanner, nor clothes to a gentile launderer, unless</b> there is <b>sufficient time for</b> work on <b>them to be completed while it is still day,</b> before Shabbat begins. <b>And in all of them Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so <b>with</b> <b>the sun,</b> i.e., as long as the sun is shining on Friday. ",
            "<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: The</b> ancestral <b>house of</b> my <b>father,</b> the dynasty of <i>Nesi’im</i> from the house of Hillel, <b>was accustomed to give</b> its <b>white clothes to a gentile launderer</b> no fewer than <b>three days before Shabbat. And,</b> however, <b>these,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>and those,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>agree that,</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>one may load the beam of the olive press</b> on the olives on Shabbat eve while it is still day, so that the oil will continue to be squeezed out of the olives on Shabbat. So too, one may load the <b>circular wine press</b> to accelerate the process of producing wine from the grapes.",
            "This mishna enumerates actions that may only be performed on Shabbat eve if the prohibited labor will be totally or mostly completed while it is still day. <b>One may only roast meat, an onion, or an egg if</b> there remains <b>sufficient</b> time <b>so that they could be roasted while it is still day. One may only place</b> dough to bake into <b>bread in the oven</b> on Shabbat eve <b>at nightfall, and</b> may only place <b>a cake on the coals, if</b> there is time <b>enough that</b> the <b>surface</b> of this cake or bread <b>will form a crust while it is still day. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Enough time so <b>that its bottom</b> crust <b>should harden,</b> which takes less time.",
            "However in a case that is an exception, <b>one may,</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>lower the Paschal lamb</b> into the oven on Shabbat eve <b>at nightfall,</b> so that its roasting is completed on Shabbat if Passover eve coincides with Shabbat eve. <b>And one may,</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>kindle the fire in the bonfire of the Chamber of the Hearth</b> in the Temple on Shabbat eve, adjacent to the start of Shabbat, and allow the fire to spread afterward throughout all the wood in the bonfire. <b>And,</b> however, <b>in the outlying areas,</b> meaning in all of Eretz Yisrael outside the Temple, it is prohibited to light a bonfire on Shabbat eve, unless there is sufficient <b>time for the fire to take hold in most of</b> the bonfire, while it is still day. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: With</b> a bonfire of <b>coals,</b> even in the outlying areas one is permitted to light the fire on Shabbat eve at nightfall, even if the fire only spread to <b>any amount</b> of the bonfire. The coals, once they are kindled, will not be extinguished again, and there is no concern lest he come to tend to them on Shabbat."

            "This mishna cites a list of fuels and wicks that one may not use in kindling the Shabbat lights, either because their use might induce one to perform a prohibited labor on Shabbat or because they are not in keeping with the deference due Shabbat. The mishna begins by listing the materials that one may not use as wicks. That is followed by a list of the substances that one may not use as fuel.<br><br><b>With what may one light</b> the Shabbat lamp, <b>and with what may one not light</b> it? With regard to types of prohibited wicks, one may light <b>neither with cedar bast [<i>lekhesh</i>], nor with uncombed flax [<i>ḥosen</i>], nor with raw silk [<i>kalakh</i>], nor with willow bast [<i>petilat ha</i>’<i>idan</i>], nor with desert weed [<i>petilat hamidbar</i>], nor with green</b> moss <b>that is on</b> the <b>surface of the water.</b> With regard to types of prohibited oils, one may light <b>neither with pitch [<i>zefet</i>], nor with wax [<i>sha</i>’<i>ava</i>], nor with castor oil [<i>shemen kik</i>], nor with burnt oil [<i>shemen sereifa</i>], nor with</b> fat from <b>a sheep’s tail [<i>alya</i>], nor with tallow [<i>ḥelev</i>]. Naḥum the Mede says: One may light with boiled tallow. And the Rabbis say: Both</b> tallow that was <b>boiled and</b> tallow that was <b>not boiled, one may not light with them.</b>",
            "In continuation of the previous mishna, this mishna adds that <b>one may not light with burnt oil on a Festival,</b> as the Gemara will explain below. With regard to lighting Shabbat lamps, there were Sages who prohibited the use of specific oils. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> that <b>one may not light with tar [<i>itran</i>] in deference to Shabbat</b> because tar smells bad and disturbs those in the house. <b>And the Rabbis permit</b> lighting <b>with all oils</b> for lamps as long as they burn properly; <b>with sesame oil, with nut oil, with turnip oil, with fish oil, with gourd oil, with tar, and</b> even <b>with naphtha [<i>neft</i>]. Rabbi Tarfon says: One may light only with olive oil</b> in deference to Shabbat, as it is the choicest and most pleasant of the oils.",
            "Of <b>all</b> substances <b>that emerge from the tree, one may light only with flax</b> on Shabbat (<i>Tosafot</i>) because the other substances do not burn well. <b>And</b> of <b>all</b> substances <b>that emerge from the tree, the only</b> substance <b>that becomes ritually impure</b> with impurity transmitted by <b>tents</b> over a corpse <b>is flax.</b> If there is a dead body inside a house or a tent that is made from any materials that originate from a tree, everything in the house becomes ritually impure. However, only in the case of flax does the tent itself become impure. <b>The wick of a garment,</b> i.e., cloth made into a wick for a lamp, <b>that one folded it</b> into a size and shape suitable for a wick, <b>but did not</b> yet <b>singe it</b> slightly in order to facilitate its lighting, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This wick is <b>ritually impure.</b> With regard to the laws of ritual impurity, it can, like other garments, still become ritually impure <b>and one may not light with it</b> on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: It is ritually pure and one may</b> even <b>light with it</b> on Shabbat.",
            "The fundamental dispute in this mishna is with regard to the determination whether or not indirect acts of kindling and extinguishing fall within the parameters of the prohibition on Shabbat. The Rabbis said: <b>A person may not pierce</b> a hole in <b>an eggshell and fill it with oil, and place it over</b> the mouth of <b>a lamp so that</b> the egg <b>will drip</b> additional oil into the lamp and thereby extend the time that it burns. <b>And</b> this is the ruling <b>even</b> if <b>it is</b> not an actual egg but an <b>earthenware</b> vessel. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> doing so. <b>However, if the craftsman,</b> who crafts ceramic vessels, <b>attached</b> the egg to the lamp <b>from the outset, one is permitted</b> to fill it with oil <b>because it</b> constitutes <b>a single,</b> large <b>vessel.</b> The Rabbis decreed that <b>a person may not fill a bowl with oil, and place it beside the lamp, and place the</b> unlit <b>head of the wick into</b> the bowl <b>so that it draws</b> additional oil from the bowl and thereby extend the time that the lamp burns. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> doing so.",
            "<b>One who extinguishes the lamp</b> on Shabbat <b>because he is afraid due to gentiles,</b> from whom he is hiding in his home, <b>and due to thieves,</b> or if one is afraid <b>due to an evil spirit,</b> i.e., he is depressed and prefers sitting in the dark, or if he extinguished the flame <b>due to the sick person</b> so that he <b>will sleep,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> However, in a case where he extinguishes the flame in order to <b>spare the lamp, spare the oil, or spare the wick,</b> he is <b>liable. Rabbi Yosei exempts</b> him <b>in all of</b> those cases, as in his opinion no labor prohibited by Torah law is being performed by extinguishing the flame, <b>except for</b> the case where he seeks to spare <b>the wick.</b> Only in that case is extinguishing a creative action <b>because he makes</b> the wick into <b>charcoal</b> by extinguishing the flame.",
            "This mishna concludes the aggadic treatment of the topic of kindling the Shabbat lights. <b>For three transgressions women</b> are punished and <b>die during childbirth: For</b> the fact <b>that they are not careful in</b> observing the laws of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> and <b>in</b> separating <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from the dough, <b>and in lighting</b> the Shabbat <b>lamp.</b>",
            "There are <b>three things a person must say in his home on Shabbat eve at nightfall</b> and not before. The mishna elaborates: He should ask the members of his household, <b>have you tithed</b> the crop that required tithing? <b>Have you placed the <i>eiruv</i></b> for joining the courtyards and joining the Shabbat borders? If you have done so, <b>light the lamp</b> in honor of Shabbat. The Sages stated a principle: If the time arrives on Friday when there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether it is <b>nightfall</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it is <b>not</b> yet <b>nightfall, one may not tithe</b> the crop that has <b>definitely</b> not been tithed, <b>and one may not immerse</b> ritually impure <b>vessels</b> in a ritual bath to render them ritually pure, <b>and one may not light the</b> Shabbat <b>lights. However, one may tithe <i>demai</i>,</b> doubtfully tithed produce, which must be tithed due to mere suspicion. <b>And one may place an <i>eiruv</i> and insulate the hot water</b> to be used on Shabbat."
        ],
        [
            "With regard to <b>a stove that was lit</b> on Shabbat eve <b>with straw</b> or <b>with rakings,</b> scraps collected from the field, one may <b>place</b> a pot of <b>cooked food atop it</b> on Shabbat. The fire in this stove was certainly extinguished while it was still day, as both straw and rakings are materials that burn quickly. However, if the stove was lit <b>with pomace,</b> pulp that remains from sesame seeds, olives, and the like after the oil is squeezed from them, <b>and</b> if it was lit <b>with wood,</b> one may <b>not place</b> a pot atop it on Shabbat <b>until he sweeps</b> the coals from the stove while it is still day <b>or until he places ashes</b> on the coals, so that the fire will not ignite on Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Even after one has swept away the coals, it is only permitted to place <b>hot water</b> on it, as it is sufficiently hot and does not require additional cooking, <b>but not cooked food.</b> Since, in general, one prefers that food will cook more, there is concern lest he come to ignite the fire by stoking the coals. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Both <b>hot water and cooked food</b> may be placed. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may remove</b> a pot from the stove on Shabbat <b>but</b> may <b>not return</b> it. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may <b>even return it.</b>",
            "The <i>halakhot</i> that were stated with regard to a stove were specific to a stove’s unique structure and the manner in which it retains heat. However, with regard to other baking apparatuses, i.e., an oven or a <i>kupaḥ,</i> there are different rules. The mishna delineates: <b>An oven that they lit</b> even <b>with straw</b> or <b>rakings, one may neither place</b> a pot <b>inside it nor atop it</b> on Shabbat. Whereas a <b><i>kupaḥ</i> that was lit with straw</b> or <b>rakings, its</b> legal status is <b>like</b> that of <b>a stove,</b> and one is permitted to place a pot atop it on Shabbat. If it were lit <b>with pomace</b> or <b>with wood, its</b> legal status is <b>like</b> that of <b>an oven</b> and it is prohibited to place a pot atop it on Shabbat.",
            "In addition to the <i>halakhot</i> that deal with cooking on the fire on Shabbat, several related <i>halakhot</i> are discussed. The mishna says: <b>One may not place a</b> raw <b>egg next to an urn</b> full of hot water <b>so that it will roast slightly. And one may not</b> even <b>wrap it in cloths,</b> i.e., one may not heat the egg inside cloths that were heated in the sun. <b>And Rabbi Yosei permits</b> doing so in that case. <b>And,</b> similarly, <b>one may not insulate it in sand</b> or <b>in road dust</b> that was heated in the sun <b>so that it will roast.</b> Although there is no actual cooking with fire here, it is similar to cooking and the Sages issued a decree to prohibit doing so.",
            "The mishna relates <b>a story about the people of</b> the city of <b>Tiberias, and they ran a cold-water pipe [<i>silon</i>] through a canal of hot</b> water from the Tiberias hot springs. They thought that by doing so, they could heat the cold potable water on Shabbat. <b>The Rabbis said to them: If</b> the water passed through <b>on Shabbat,</b> its legal status is <b>like</b> that of <b>hot water that was heated on Shabbat, and</b> the water is <b>prohibited</b> both <b>for bathing and for drinking. And if</b> the water passed through <b>on a Festival, then it is prohibited</b> for <b>bathing but permitted for drinking.</b> On Festivals, one is even permitted to boil water on actual fire for the purposes of eating and drinking. In this mishna, the Sages discuss two vessels used for heating water. With regard to <b>a <i>mulyar</i>,</b> a bronze vessel into which coals are placed in an outer compartment and water is placed into an adjacent inner compartment, whose coals were <b>swept, one may drink from it on Shabbat.</b> With regard to <b>an <i>antikhi</i>,</b> which is a vessel with a different configuration, <b>even if</b> its coals were <b>swept, one may not drink from it</b> on Shabbat.",
            "The Sages added to the laws of leaving food on a source of heat and cooking food on Shabbat: <b>An urn that was emptied</b> of its hot water on Shabbat, <b>one may not place cold water into it so that</b> the cold water <b>will be heated. However, one may place</b> cold water <b>into</b> an urn <b>or into a cup</b> that were emptied of their hot water <b>in order to warm it</b> but not in order to heat it. In continuation of the discussion of vessels where the prohibition of cooking applies even though the vessels are not actually on the fire itself, the mishna establishes: <b>A stew pot [<i>ilpas</i>] and a pot that were removed</b> from the fire while they were still <b>boiling,</b> even if they were removed before Shabbat, <b>one may not place spices into them</b> on Shabbat itself. Even though the pot is not actually standing on the fire, the spices are still cooked in it because the pot is a primary vessel, i.e., a vessel whose contents were cooked on the fire. <b>However, one may place</b> the spices <b>into a bowl or into a tureen [<i>tamḥui</i>],</b> which is a large bowl into which people pour the contents a stew pot or a pot. Bowls and tureens are both secondary vessels and food placed into them does not get cooked. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may place</b> spices <b>into anything</b> on Shabbat <b>except for</b> a vessel that has in it <b>something containing vinegar</b> or <b>brine</b> of salted fish.",
            "From a discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of insulation and preparation for Shabbat followed by a brief tangent dealing with the prohibited labor of cooking on Shabbat, the mishna proceeds to briefly discuss prohibitions relating to set-aside [<i>muktze</i>] items in terms of Shabbat lamps. <b>One may not place a vessel beneath the</b> oil <b>lamp,</b> the vessel containing the oil and the wick, on Shabbat in order <b>to receive the oil</b> that drips from the wick. <b>And if one placed</b> the vessel on Friday <b>while it was still day, it is permitted. However,</b> in any case, <b>one may not make use of</b> the oil on Shabbat <b>because it is not from the</b> oil <b>prepared</b> from Shabbat eve for use on Shabbat. The oil in the lamp was already set aside and designated solely for the purpose of lighting the lamp. The dispute in this mishna seems to be a local one; however, it is the key to several <i>halakhot</i> in the area of the prohibition of set-aside [<i>muktze</i>]. <b>One may move a new</b> oil <b>lamp</b> on Shabbat <b>but not</b> an <b>old</b> one that was already used. A lamp that was used is covered with soot and unsuitable for use. It is therefore considered set aside from use due to its disgusting nature. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All</b> oil <b>lamps may be moved</b> on Shabbat <b>except for an</b> oil <b>lamp</b> that is <b>burning on Shabbat,</b> due to the concern that it might be extinguished. <b>One may place a vessel beneath the</b> oil <b>lamp</b> in order <b>to receive</b> burning <b>sparks</b> of oil that fall from the lamp so that they will not cause a fire. <b>And he may not place water into</b> the vessel <b>because he</b> thereby <b>extinguishes</b> the sparks. When a pot is removed from the fire on Shabbat eve it may be insulated in materials that preserve its heat, but not in materials that increase its heat. Raising the temperature of a pot is tantamount to cooking. "
        ],
        [
            "The <i>mishnayot</i> that follow list those materials in which such a pot may be insulated on Shabbat eve and those materials in which it may not be insulated.<br><br><b>In what may one insulate</b> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <b>and in what may one not insulate</b> it?<b> One may neither insulate</b> it <b>in the solid residue</b> of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <b>nor in manure, nor in salt, nor in lime, nor in sand, whether</b> those materials are <b>moist</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>dry.</b> All of these materials spontaneously generate heat when piled for an extended period. Therefore, they add heat to a pot insulated in them. <b>And</b> one may <b>neither</b> insulate a pot <b>in straw, nor in the residue of grapes</b> that have been pressed for their juice, <b>nor in soft material,</b> e.g., from tattered clothing, <b>nor in grass, when these</b> materials <b>are moist.

            "<b>One may insulate</b> cooked food on Shabbat eve <b>in</b> animal <b>hides and may move</b> those hides on Shabbat. So too, one may insulate food <b>in wool fleece and,</b> in contrast to hides, <b>one may not move</b> the fleece.<b>How,</b> then, <b>does one act</b> if he insulated food in fleece, and now wishes to remove the pot? <b>He lifts the cover,</b> which he is permitted to move, <b>and</b> the fleece <b>falls</b> by itself. He need not even touch it. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> If he placed the pot in <b>a basket</b> filled with fleece, <b>he leans</b> the basket <b>on its side</b> so that the fleece will fall to the side <b>and takes</b> the pot. Otherwise, there is concern <b>lest</b> the wool collapse when <b>he lifts</b> the pot from the basket. <b>And</b> then, <b>he will be unable to replace</b> the pot, as it is prohibited to move the wool to make room for the pot, since the wool is set-aside. <b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say: He may take</b> the pot <b>and</b> afterward <b>replace it.</b> If <b>one did not cover</b> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve <b>while it was still day, he may not cover it after dark.</b> However, if <b>one covered it</b> while it was still day <b>and it was uncovered</b> on Shabbat, <b>he is permitted to cover it</b> even on Shabbat. <b>One may fill a jug</b> with cold water on Shabbat <b>and place</b> it <b>beneath a pillow or a cushion</b> to prevent it from getting warm."
