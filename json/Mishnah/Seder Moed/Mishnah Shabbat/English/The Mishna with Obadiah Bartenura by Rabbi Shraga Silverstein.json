            "\tThe yetzioth [acts of carrying out from one domain to another] of Shabbath [i.e., stated in respect to Shabbath (Hachnasoth — acts of bringing in — are also called \"yetzioth,\" in that there is taking out from one domain to another). The reason we have \"yetzioth\" (lit., \"goings-out\") rather than \"hotzaoth\" (\"carryings-out\"), is that the language of Scripture is being followed, viz. (Exodus 16:29): \"Let a man not go out of his place,\" which is expounded as referring to \"carrying out,\" i.e., Let a man not go out of his place with his receptacle in hand to gather the manna.] (The yetzioth of Shabbath) are two, [two that are Torah-interdicted — hotza'ah and hachnasah vis-à-vis the ba'al habayith (the house occupant), who stands inside, in the private domain. And for these two he is liable: for unwitting violation, a sin-offering; for witting violation, kareth (\"cutting-off\"); and for forewarning, stoning, as with all the other forbidden Sabbath labors.], which are four inside [The rabbis added two as forbidden ab initio when the labor is performed by two, one picking up; the other, putting down. For (by Torah ordinance) two who perform a labor (together) are not liable, it being written (Leviticus 4:27): \"…in doing it, one of the mitzvoth of the L rd which may not be done\" — in doing all of it, and not part of it. The same applies to all of the Sabbath labors. We say: One who did it is liable; two who did it are exempt.], and which are four outside. [two that are Torah-interdicted — hotza'ah and hachnasah vis-à-vis the mendicant, who stands outside, in the public domain. They are four, the rabbis having added two, to be forbidden ab initio, when one picks up and the other puts down.] How so? The mendicant stands outside and the ba'al habayith, inside. If the mendicant extended his hand [with the basket for the loaves of the ba'al habayith] inside, [(\"hotza'ah\" being depicted by way of rich man and poor man to apprise us, incidentally, that a mitzvah coming through a transgression is forbidden, and that there is liability for it)], and placed it into the hand of the ba'al habayith [in which instance he effects \"picking up\" (akirah) from the public domain and \"putting down\" (hanachah) in the private domain], or if he took (the object) from it and brought (it) out [and placed it in the public domain, effecting akirah and hanachah], the mendicant is liable, [having performed a complete labor. These are the two Torah-interdicted labors for the one standing outside. And even though we require akirah from a place which is four by four hand-breadths and hanachah onto a place which is four by four, which does not obtain here, the hand of the mendicant and that of the ba'al habayith not being that large, it is stated in the gemara that a man's hand is considered as four by four in that even very large objects are wont to be placed therein and taken therefrom.], and the ba'al habayith is exempt [exempt, and it is absolutely permitted, for he did nothing]. If the ba'al habayith extended his hand outside and placed it (the object) into the hand of the mendicant, or if he took (the object) from it and brought (it) in, the ba'al habayith is liable and the mendicant is exempt. [These are the two Torah-interdicted labors for the one standing inside.] If the mendicant extended his hand inside [effecting akirah from the public domain] and the ba'al habayith took from it [and put it down inside, effecting hanachah in the private domain]; of if he (the ba'al habayith) placed (the object) into it, [effecting akirah from the private domain] and he [the mendicant] took it out [and placed it in the public domain], they are both exempt, [for neither performed a complete labor. But they are forbidden to do this lest each in himself come to do a complete labor on the Sabbath. These are two rabbinically interdicted labors, one for the mendicant on the outside and one for the ba'al habayith on the inside. (The reason that two acts are not mentioned for each — akirah for the mendicant and akirah for the ba'al habayith; hanachah for the mendicant and hanachah for the ba'al habayith — is that only the akiroth are of significance in this regard, in that they are the beginning of the labor and it is to be feared that he might complete it; but hanachoth, which are the end of the labor, are not reckoned.)] If the ba'al habayith extended his hand outside, and the mendicant took from it, or if he (the mendicant) placed (the object) into it, and he (the ba'al habayith) brought it in, they are both exempt.",
            "\tA man should not sit before the barber close to (the time of) the Minchah prayer before praying. [He should not do so even in the weekdays. This is stated here because of what is to follow (1:3): \"A tailor should not go out with his needle … lest he forget and carry,\" akin to \"A man should not sit before the barber close to Minchah lest he forget and not pray.\" Since there are only a few things to be stated in this regard, they are mentioned first, after which those things pertaining to the Sabbath are expatiated upon. (\"close to Minchah\":) Minchah Gedolah, from six and a half hours on. \"close to Minchah\" is from the beginning of the seventh hour. And though there is ample time (for Minchah Gedolah), this (sitting before the barber) was decreed against, lest the barber's scissors break after he begins cutting and the time for the prayer pass before they are repaired and the haircut is completed.] A man may not enter the bathhouse [close to Minchah, lest he faint], nor the tannery [lest he find that the hides will spoil if he does not move them from their place and tend to them, doing which, he might miss the time for prayer], nor may he eat [even a small meal, lest he tarry over it], nor may judges sit in judgment [even at its conclusion, when the claims of the litigants have already been heard and nothing more remains to be done than to pronounce judgment, (still, they may not do so close to Minchah) lest they find a reason to countermand their intended ruling and return to the beginning of the deliberation.] But if they have begun, [in any of the aforementioned instances], they do not break off, but finish and then pray — [this, on condition that there is enough time to finish the activity before the time for prayer passes. The beginning of hair-cutting is the placing of the barber's sheet on his knees so that hair not fall on his garment. The beginning of the bath — taking off his innermost garment. Others say: taking off his scarf, the first article of clothing to be removed. The beginning of tanning — tying the apron around his shoulders to begin tanning. The beginning of eating — washing the hands. The beginning of judgment — donning the robes to sit in judgment in fear and awe. And if they were already robed and sitting in judgment and another case came before them close to Minchah, the beginning of that judgment is when the litigants begin their presentation.] They break off for the recital of the Shema, but they do not break off for prayer (the Amidah). [This is an independent statement, viz.: Scholars occupied in Torah study break off their study for the recital of the Shema, which has a fixed time, viz. (Deuteronomy 6:7): \"when you lie down and when you arise.\" But they do not break off for prayer, which has no Torah-ordained fixed time. And this applies only to such as R. Shimon b. Yochai and his colleagues, whose Torah was their \"trade.\" But we — since we break off our Torah (study) for our trade, how much more so do we break it off for prayer.]",
            "\tA tailor should not go out with his needle close to nightfall (on Sabbath eve) lest he forget and carry, [even though it is stuck in his garment. And it is a craftsman in the manner of his craft who is liable, it being the way of craftsmen to stick them in their garments when they go out to the marketplace. (\"lest he forget and carry\":) when it gets dark.], nor the scribe with his quill, [which is stuck behind his ear in the manner of scribes]; nor may he remove (yefaleh) lice from his garments. [the Targum of (Deuteronomy 26:13): \"I have removed the holy thing\" is \"palethi kodesh\"] or read [a book] by the light of a lamp (on the Sabbath) [lest he incline it to bring the oil to the wick so that it burn well and he thereby light a fire on the Sabbath. And even if the lamp were two or three lengths in height, it is always forbidden to read by its light unless there be another man with him to guard him, or unless he were  a man of eminence, who would never adjust a lamp.] It was, in truth, stated: The chazan [a teacher of young children] sees (by the light of a lamp) from where the children [begin to] read, [for they did not decree against the possibility of his inclining the lamp for such slight perusal. And the children may read before their teacher by the light of the lamp, for his fear is upon them.], but he may not read [the entire section, for their fear is not upon him, and their guarding is no guarding. And for this reason, too, there is one (sage) who holds that a woman's guarding her husband is no guarding, her fear not being upon him.] Likewise, [to keep one far from transgression, they said that] a zav (a man with a genital discharge) should not eat with (his wife) a zavah, though both of them are unclean] because of (the possibility of) familiarity (conducing to) transgression. [Because of their being alone together, he might come to cohabit with a zavah, who is kareth-interdicted. \"zav and zavah\" are stated for the sake of the greater learning, that even where cohabitation is difficult for them, so that there is reason not to fear such transgression, still, they should not eat with each other.]",
            "\tAnd these [\"One may not remove lice from his garments or read by the light of a lamp\" (above)] are among the halachoth that they stated in the upper chamber of Chananiah b. Chezkiah b. Gurion when they went up to visit him. [The sages wished to secrete the Book of Ezekiel, whose words seemed to contradict words of Torah, e.g., (Ezekiel 44:31): \"All that is carrion or treifah (organically \"torn\") of fowl or of beast the Cohanim shall not eat\" — The Cohanim shall not eat it, but the Israelites may? Likewise, (Ibid. 45:20): \"And thus shall you do on the seventh of the month.\" Where is this offering intimated in the Torah? And Chananiah b. Chezkiah secreted himself in an upper chamber and sat there and explained the Book of Ezekiel.] They took a count and Beth Shammai were (found to be) more numerous than Beth Hillel [Beth Shammai differed with Beth Hillel, and Beth Shammai being more numerous, it was ruled according to them, viz. (Exodus 23:2): \"After many to incline.\"], and they decreed eighteen things on that day. [All eighteen are adduced in the gemara, viz.: If one eats a food of first-degree or second-degree uncleanliness, they decreed that his body assume second-degree uncleanliness and render terumah unfit by contact, (second-degree uncleanliness invalidating terumah). These are two decrees involving food, food of first-degree and of second degree uncleanliness. And if one drinks unclean liquids he also assumes second-degree uncleanliness and invalidates terumah. This is a third decree. The reason that these were decreed against is that sometimes one has in his mouth food that is tamei (ritually unclean) and takes in liquids of terumah, which are thus rendered pasul (unfit); and sometimes he has in his mouth liquids that are tamei, and takes in food of terumah, which is thus rendered pasul. And they decreed (uncleanliness) upon one who had come rosho verubo (his head and most of his body) into drawn water on the same day that he had immersed himself for his uncleanliness; and (they decreed uncleanliness) upon one who was clean to begin with, upon whose head there fell five logs of drawn water — thus, five decrees. The reason for uncleanliness being decreed upon these to impart uncleanliness to men is that they were wont to immerse in stagnant cave-water, after which they would douse themselves with drawn water to remove the foulness — as a result of which they began to say that it was not the cave-water which effected the cleanliness, but the drawn water. They (the sages), therefore, arose and decreed uncleanliness upon them lest they come to immerse regularly in drawn water as in a mikveh. The sixth decree: that scrolls of Scripture render terumah pasul by contact. For in the beginning they would secrete terumah foods with the scrolls, saying that both are holy. When they saw, however, that the scrolls were thereby spoiled (mice nibbling the scrolls together with the food), they decreed that the scrolls — Torah, Prophets, and Writings — render terumah pasul. The seventh: They decreed that hands render terumah pasul, for hands are \"busy\" and touch one's privy parts, and it is offensive to touch terumah with befouled hands and to render it revolting to its eaters. The eighth decree: that foods be rendered unclean by liquids which had been rendered unclean by hands touching them before being washed. For all things which render terumah pasul impart first-degree uncleanliness to liquids — a decree by reason of liquids which come from a sheretz (a creeping thing), which we find to be of first-degree uncleanliness by Torah ordinance. And the reason that all liquid-uncleanliness was decreed to be first-order uncleanliness, though we do not find a similar decree for foods by reason of food-matter coming from a sheretz is that the rabbis were more stringent in respect to liquids, which are (always) susceptible of uncleanliness, not requiring any predisposing factor for such susceptibility, as opposed to foods, which require the addition of water. The ninth decree: Vessels which became tamei through liquids which became tamei through a sheretz. Even though they (the liquids) are of first-degree uncleanliness by Torah ordinance, they cannot impart uncleanliness to men or vessels, for these become unclean only through proto-uncleanliness (av hatumah). But the rabbis ordained that they become unclean through vessels, a decree by reason of liquids of the zav and the zavah (their spittle and urine); for they are av hatumah and render vessels unclean by Torah ordinance. The tenth decree: that the daughters of Cuthites be (regarded as) niddoth from their cradle; that is, from the day of their birth. For a one-day old girl is subject to niddah uncleanliness. But the Cuthites do not expound it thus (see Niddah 4:1), so that when they see (blood in young girls), they do not separate them, for which reason the rabbis made this decree. The eleventh decree: that all movable objects confer uncleanliness with the thickness of a plow-handle, whose surface is a tefach (a handbreadth), but not its thickness. And though by Torah ordinance, there is no tent-uncleanliness with less than (thickness of) a tefach, the rabbis decreed respecting all movable objects whose surface is a tefach, that if one of its heads tented a dead body, and the other, vessels, tent-uncleanliness is imparted to the vessels, a decree by reason of objects a tefach thick, which confer such uncleanliness by Torah ordinance.  The twelfth decree: If one picks grapes to tread them in the wine-press, the liquid which they exude when picked makes them tumah-susceptible, even though it (the liquid) goes lost and he is not intent upon it — a decree lest he pick them in pitch-lined baskets, in which instance, the liquid not going lost, he is intent upon it, and it confers tumah-susceptibility by Torah ordinance. The thirteenth decree: that the growths of terumah be (regarded as) terumah, even with something whose seed perishes, such as grain and pulse — a decree by reason of unclean terumah in the hand of a Cohein, which may not be eaten and which he intends to sow. They decreed that it retain its original designation, so that it is \"terumah teme'ah.\" We fear that he might hold onto it until the time for planting and come to eat of it in its unclean state. The fourteenth decree; If darkness descended upon one (on Sabbath eve) on the road, he gives his purse to a gentile and may not carry it less than four cubits (progressively). The fifteenth and sixteenth decrees: \"One may not remove lice or read by the light of a lamp\" — our Mishnah. The seventeenth: They decreed against the loaf, the oil, the wine, and the daughters of the gentiles. And it is all one decree, as stated: They decreed against their loaf because of their oil, against their oil because of their wine, against their wine because of their daughters, and against their daughters because of \"something else,\" i.e., idolatry. The eighteenth: They decreed that a gentile child confer zav uncleanliness, so that a Jewish child not be familiar with him at risk of sodomy.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: Ink [i.e., dyes from which ink is made], dyes [for paints] and karshinim [an animal food, which they would first soak], are not soaked (on Sabbath eve), unless they be soaked (i.e., fully softened) while it is yet day. [Beth Shammai hold that one is exhorted in respect to the resting of his vessels (on the Sabbath), just as he is exhorted in respect to the resting of his beast. And this is, likewise, the reason for (1:6) \"Bundles of flax are not placed into the oven,\" and (Ibid.): \"Nets are not spread.\" As to a lamp burning on the Sabbath and a pot on the stove, where Beth Shammai concede (that it is permitted), this is where he renounces ownership of the vessels, in which instance he is not commanded in respect to their resting.] And Beth Hillel permit it [when the water was put in while it was still day, even though they undergo soaking on the Sabbath, Beth Hillel holding that a man was exhorted in respect to the resting of his beast on the Sabbath, where there is distress for the animal (in not resting), but not in respect to the resting of vessels.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: Bundles of flax are not placed into the oven [to whiten], unless they are [fully steamed] while it is yet day; nor wool into the [dyer's] vat, unless the color take [while it is yet day.] Beth Hillel permit it, [i.e., to put it there while it is yet day and have the color take the entire night. Beth Hillel permit it only in a vat removed from the fire. For if there is a fire under it on the Sabbath, it is forbidden — a gezeirah, lest he stir the coals. And the vat must also be closed and sealed with lime — a gezeirah lest he stir and mix it on the Sabbath and be liable by reason of \"cooking\"]. Beth Shammai say: Nets are not spread (for trapping) animals, birds, or fish, unless they be trapped while it is still day. Beth Hillel permit it.",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: One should not sell to a gentile (on Sabbath eve), and he should not load [things onto a donkey] with him, and he should not lift [a load] onto him [i.e., onto his back, for it gives the impression that he is assisting him to carry the load on the Sabbath] — unless he is going to a place that is nearby [i.e., so that the place he wishes to carry it to be close enough to reach while it is still day.] Beth Hillel permit it, [so long as he leaves the door of his house while it is still day].",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: One should not give hides to a (gentile) tanner or clothes to a gentile washerman, unless they can be done while it is still day. And with all, Beth Hillel permit it \"with the sun\" [i.e., so long as the sun is upon the earth, before it sets.]",
            "\tR. Shimon b. Gamliel said: In my father's house they would give white clothing to a gentile washerman three days before Shabbath. [White clothing is difficult to wash and requires three days, and they took upon themselves the more stringent ruling of Beth Shammai. The halachah is not in accordance with Beth Shammai, but with Beth Hillel, who permit it \"with the sun.\"] And they [Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel] are the same (in their ruling) that the beams of the olive press and the circles of the wine press are loaded. [The olives are loaded while it is yet day with the beams of the olive press. After the olives are crushed, heavy beams are loaded upon them and the oil flows from them of itself the entire Sabbath. Those (the weights) of the wine press are called \"circles.\" They were thick boards in the form of a circle. In this, Beth Shammai concur with Beth Hillel. For even if it is done on the Sabbath, there is no sin-offering liability. For the beam is not placed upon the olives until they are first crushed in the mill. Likewise, with grapes. They are first trodden by foot, and even without the beam, the liquid is exuded of itself, albeit, not as readily as with the beam. For this reason it is not similar to (the labor of) threshing (dash)].",
            "\tMeat, onion, and egg are not to be roasted (on Sabbath eve) unless they can be roasted while it is still day [as the food of Ben D'rosa, i.e., one-third cooked, at which point it is edible, and there is no reason to decree \"lest he stir the coals\"]. A loaf is not to be placed in the oven before dark nor a chararah [a kind of cake] on coals, unless its face [i.e., its upper surface] forms a crust [(this being the beginning of baking)] while it is still day. R. Eliezer says: Until its lower surface [on the clay of the stove] forms a crust. [For it bakes first, before the upper surface, and this is sufficient. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.] ",
            "\tThe (meat of the) Pesach offering is lowered into the oven (on Sabbath eve) before dark. [The mouths of their ovens were on top, and they would lower the roast into them. And even though normally this is not done, as stated above, here it is permitted, for the men of the company (sharing the offering) are zealous and remind one another, so that they will not come to stir the coals.] And the fire of the wood-pile of the beth hamoked may be fed [a little, without fear that the Cohanim might come to light it after dark, for Cohanim are zealous. (\"beth-hamoked\":) there was a large cell in the azarah (the Temple court), where a wood-pile was constantly kept burning. And the Cohanim would warm themselves there, for they walked barefoot on a marble floor.] And in the borders (i.e., outside the Temple), until the fire catch in most of it. [One must ignite his wood-pile while there is still enough time before it gets dark for the fire to catch in most of it. How much is that? As much as it takes for the flame to ascend of itself without the assistance of chips at its base.] R. Yehudah says: With charcoal, any amount (is sufficient). [Just as with the wood-pile of the beth-hamoked, leniency was exercised with the Cohanim, in the same way, with a charcoal fed fire, leniency is exercised with all men. The fire need catch just slightly, for it does not tend to go out, and he will not come to stir the coals. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah, there being no one who differs with him.]"

        [
            "\tWith what do we kindle [the Sabbath lamp? With what do we make the wicks and the oils to light?] We do not kindle: neither with lechesh [a kind of woolly substance found in a cedar between the bark and the trunk], nor with chosen [unbeaten flax], nor with chalach [the residue of silk], nor with a wick of iddan [a kind of wool found in a willow between the outer and the inner surface], nor with a wick of midbar [a long grass which is grown for kindling], nor with yerokah on the face of the water [a kind of wooly substance growing on the walls of a boat that has been long on the water. Up to this point, unsuitable wicks; from this point on, unsuitable oils.] neither with tar, nor with wax [Melted tar or wax are not to be put in the lamp to be lit in place of oil; but to make a kind of long wick out of wax, as they were wont to do, is permitted.], nor with the oil of kik [cotton-seed oil. Others understand it as kikayon deyonah, a kind of large-leaved grass, the oil of which is especially thick. The wicks invalidated by the sages — Why? Because the flame gets caught in them; that is, the flame does not enter the wick, but remains on the outside. And the oils invalidated by the sages — because they are not \"pulled\" after the wick. And because the lamp does not burn well, we fear that he will incline the oil towards it and thus be in transgression of kindling. Or, he might leave the lamp and go out, and we rule that the Sabbath lamp is obligatory.], nor with oil for burning [oil of terumah which became unclean. Why is it called \"oil for burning\"? Because it is slated for burning, in that it may not be eaten. And we are speaking of a festival that falls out on Sabbath eve, so that when he lights the lamp while it is still day, he is found to be burning unclean oil of terumah on a festival; and we rule that it is not permitted to burn consecrated foods on a festival, viz. (Exodus 12:10): \"And what is left over of it (the Paschal offering) until morning, in fire shall you burn it,\" which is expounded: \"And what is left over of it until the first morning, until the second morning (the sixteenth of Nissan) arise and burn it\" — for what is left over is not to be burned on the festival. And the same holds true for all other consecrated foods that require burning.], nor with (oil of the) tail, nor with fats. Nachum Hamadi says: One may light with cooked (i.e., melted) fats. and the sages say: whether cooked or uncooked, one may not light with it. [The first tanna also says: \"nor with fats,\" all fats being implied. The difference between the first tanna and the sages is that one of them holds that it is permitted to light with cooked fats when a slight amount of oil is mixed with it, and the other forbids even this. It was not clear to the sages of the Talmud who forbids and who permits. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tWe may not kindle with oil for burning on a festival. [The reason is being given for what was taught in the preceding Mishnah, viz.: Why is it that \"We do not light with oil for burning?\" Because we may not kindle with oil for burning on a festival (consecrated foods not being burned on a festival.)] R. Yishmael says: We may not kindle with resin [the residue of tar] because of the honor of the Sabbath. [Its odor is especially foul; however, because it is soft, it is \"pulled\" after the wick more than tar. Therefore, if not for the honor of the Sabbath, it would be used for kindling.] And the sags permit it with all oils: with sesame oil [Sesame is a thin sweet seed found abundantly in Eretz Yisrael.], with nut oil, with radish oil, with fish oil, with paku'oth [wild cucumber] oil, with resin, and with naphtha [a kind of tar. It is white and has a foul odor.] R. Tarfon says: Only olive oil may be used for kindling. [The halachah is in accordance with the sages, that all oils may be used for kindling except those enumerated above (2:1) and except balsamum oil and white naphtha, for both of these \"fly and burn,\" and we fear that he might leave (the lamp) and go out. And there is yet another reason to forbid it with balsamum oil — a decree, lest he take some of it because of its superior quality. And it is ruled: If one puts oil into a lamp (on the Sabbath), he is liable by reason of \"kindling\"; and if he takes some of it, he is liable by reason of \"extinguishing.\"]",
            "\tWhatever issues from a tree is not used for kindling [i.e., to make a wick of it] except flax, [which is called a \"tree,\" viz. (Joshua 2:6): \"And she hid them among the tree-flax,\" in spite of which we kindle with a wick made from it. And hemp and cotton do not issue from a tree, but are kinds of seed, for which reason they are kindled with. And flax, too, is a kind of seed, and is added (as being permitted) only because it is called a tree, viz.: \"And she hid them among the tree-flax.\"] And whatever issues from a tree does not produce tent-uncleanliness [(If one made a tent of them, and the dead body were under it, it is as any other house and does not require sprinkling and immersion; for the tent itself does not acquire uncleanliness, but only the vessels under it.)] except flax, [in which instance the tent itself becomes unclean, it being written (Numbers 19:18): \"And he shall sprinkle on the tent\"; and it is derived (by identity) \"tent\" - \"tent\" from what is stated in respect to the Tabernacle, viz. (Exodus 40:19): \"And he spread the tent upon the tabernacle.\" And in the tent of the tabernacle there was nothing that issued from a tree but flax, viz. (Ibid. 26:1): \"ten curtains of twisted flax.\"] A wick (made from) a garment, which was twisted, but not yet singed [on a flame for proper kindling (We are speaking of a garment fragment which is exactly three by three fingers)] — R. Eliezer says: It is unclean, and we do not kindle with it. R. Akiva says: It is clean, and we kindle with it. [(\"It is unclean\":) For its having been twisted does not remove it from the status of \"garment,\" its not having been singed. (\"It is clean\":) Its having been twisted removes it from the status of \"garment,\" so that it is as if it lacks three by three fingers; and anything less than that size acquires neither plague-uncleanliness nor dead-body uncleanliness. (\"and we do not kindle with it\":) We are speaking of a festival which falls out on Sabbath eve, where the interdict of muktzeh obtains, and we cannot kindle with pieces of articles (kelim), which were broken on that day, for this would be \"nolad\" (lit., \"born\" on that day). But we can kindle with (complete) articles, for it is permitted to move them. And all hold that one must light most of the wick emerging from the lamp before he removes his hand. Thus, the rationale of R. Eliezer, who says that we do not kindle with it: Its having been twisted does not remove it from the status of (a complete) \"article,\" so that when he lights a little of it, since it is exactly three by three, he renders it a piece of an article (for less than three by three is not an article), and when he lights it with his hands to complete (the requirement of lighting) the majority of what issues forth (from the lamp), he is found to be lighting a piece of an article which was broken on the festival (for when we say that it is permitted to light articles, this is only when they are not touched after they are reduced in size).

But if it has a signet, in which instance it is not an ornament for her, we say later that she is liable for a sin-offering, even though she takes it out on her finger by way of wearing it. For sometimes her husband removes it from his finger and gives it to his wife to put away, and she places it on her finger and goes with it, by way of carrying. And the same holds true for a ring without a signet, which is not an ornament for a man. He is liable for a sin-offering even if he takes it out on his finger by way of wearing it. For sometimes his wife gives it to him to take to the jeweler and he takes it out on his finger], nor with a pin which has no hole in it.

(Exodus 31:13): \"My Sabbaths shall you keep,\" the implication being: one \"keeping\" for many Sabbaths (collectively)]. If one knows of the institution of Sabbath [i.e., that it is promulgated in the Torah and that labors are forbidden on it], and he performed many labors on many Sabbaths [through unwittingness in respect to Sabbath, i.e., not knowing that the day was Sabbath], he is liable for [one sin-offering] for each and every Sabbath, it being stated in this regard (Ibid. 16): \"And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath,\" the implication being: a \"keeping\" for each and every Sabbath; that is, a sin-offering for each Sabbath (individually). And even though it was not known to him in the interim so that it is one act of forgetfulness, we say that the days in between constitute \"knowing.\" For it is impossible that he did not hear in between that that day was Sabbath, but he forgot the labors that he had performed upon it. Therefore, each Sabbath is considered one (distinct) unwittingness.] If one knows that it is Sabbath and he performs many labors on many Sabbaths, he is liable for each av melachah (\"proto-labor\"). If one performs many labors of the type of one labor, he is liable for only one sin-offering. [If one does not know that these labors are forbidden and he performs them several times on several Sabbaths, he is liable for one sin-offering for every av melachah. Even though he repeated them on several Sabbaths, each av of them is considered one act of unwittingness, for it was not known to him in the interim (that the labor was forbidden). And here it cannot be said that the days in between (one Sabbath and the next) constitute \"knowing\" to divide (between one Sabbath and the next). For the days in between give him no knowledge of which labor is forbidden and which permitted, unless he sits before sages and studies the laws of Shabbath. And he is likewise liable if he performs two toldoth (derivatives) of two distinct avoth — For each one, (he is liable) a distinct sin-offering. But if he performed an av and its toldah, or two toldoth of one av, he is liable only for one, as stated below: \"If one performs many labors of the type of one labor, he is liable for only one sin-offering.\" As when he performs two toldoth of the same av, in which instance he is as one who repeats a transgression in one act of forgetfulness.

And anything which does not merit being secreted, and the like of which is not secreted — if he took it out on Shabbath, only the one who secreted it is liable.

From (Isaiah 30:22): \"Tizrem kemo davah — 'Get out!' will you say to him.\" [Since a verse was used as support above in respect to a shard, another supporting verse is adduced. And \"Tizrem kemo davah\" is near \"And there will not be found among its fragments a shard.\" Or else, since it is to be taught (9:3): \"Whence is it derived that we bathe the circumcision, etc.\", we adduce the other (instances of) \"Whence is it derived,\" which are similar to it.] Just as a niddah renders unclean what she carries, so idolatry renders unclean the one who carries it. [He must wash his clothes, even if he did not touch it, as when it were in a box (that he was carrying) and the like. The rabbis differ with R. Akiva, saying that it renders unclean only by contact, as sheretz does. The halachah is in accordance with the sages. (\"Tizrem kemo davah\":) That is, let them (idolatrous objects) be in your eyes as zarim (strangers), as \"davah,\" a niddah, viz. (Leviticus 15:33): \"Vehadavah benidathah.\"]",
            "\tWhence is it derived that a ship is clean [i.e., that it does not acquire uncleanliness]? From (Proverbs 30:19): \"the way of a ship in the heart of the sea.\" [Is it not obvious that a ship is in the heart of the sea? (i.e., What are we being taught by this?) We are being apprised that the ship is like the sea, i.e., just as the sea is clean, so a ship is clean — even one of earthenware; even one that was laden on dry land and lowered into the sea.] Whence is it derived that in a garden bed six by six cubits, five (different varieties of) seeds may be sown? Four on the four sides of the bed, and one in the middle? From (Isaiah 61:11): \"For as the earth brings forth her growth, and as a garden sprouts its seeds.\" It is not written \"its seed,\" but \"its seeds.\" [(\"five (different varieties of) seeds\":) so that there be enough separation between them that they not constitute a (forbidden) admixture (kilayim). (\"Four on the four sides of the bed\":) He fills every side close to the corner, and in the middle he sows only one kernel, so that it is three cubits distant from what is sown on every side. For the \"nurturing\" distance between one seed and another is a cubit and a half. And even though near the corners in each direction the seeds are close to each other, not being three cubits removed, and being nourished by one another, there is no reason for apprehension here, for it was kilayim (the forbidden admixture) itself that Scripture was concerned with, and not with the nourishment factor. As it was taught: If there were a fence between them, one can sow next to the fence on one side; and the other, next to the fence on the other, even though they are mutually nourished from beneath. And here (in our instance) there is a clear separation; for one side is sown north-south and the other, east-west. But between the middle seed to those at the sides, there is no clear separation, and if they were close, they would constitute an admixture, for which reason they require distancing to the extent of nourishing. (\"For as the earth brings forth her growth, and as a garden sprouts its seeds\":) \"brings forth\" — one; \"her growth\" — one; \"its seeds\" — two; \"sprouts\" — one; all together — five. (That it be in an area of six cubits by) six cubits is not derived from the verse; but the rabbis know that with five varieties of seed in such an area, the corners are not nourished by the middle nor the middle by the corners, the nourishment distance of each seed being a cubit and a half. So that when Scripture intimates five seeds, it is understood to be in an area of six by six cubits. And in Tractate Kilyaim I have explained the halachoth of garden beds in detail. Here I have been brief.]",
            "\tWhence is it derived that a woman who exudes semen on the third day (after cohabitation) is unclean? [For on the third day the semen has not yet putrefied and is still viable, so that it is called \"semen (shichvath zera) which is fit to be sowed\" (haraui lehazria)]. From(Exodus 19:15): \"Be ready in three days. (Do not come near a woman.\") [The Torah desired that there be no semen uncleanliness at the giving of the Law, for which reason it separated them for three days. And it was not feared that they might exude semen on the fourth day after separation, for (by that time) it putrefies and is not fit for sowing. The halachah is that a woman who exudes semen on the third day is clean, and our Mishnah is a mistaken one, the correct reading being: \"Whence is it derived that a woman who exudes semen on the third day is clean? From: \"Be ready in three days,\" this referring to the third day of separation, on which day the Torah was given. Or else, it is not mistaken, but represents the view of the rabbis of R. Eliezer b. Azaryah, who hold that a woman who exudes semen on the third day is unclean. But the halachah is not in accordance with them.] Whence is it derived that the circumcision is bathed on the third day (after circumcision) if it falls on a Sabbath? [Even with hot water which was heated on the Sabbath. For even on the third day his life is in danger, and, it goes without saying, on the first and second days. The hot water strengthens and heals the infant's body.] From (Genesis 34:25): \"And it was on the third day (after circumcision) when they were in pain, etc.\" Whence is it derived that they would tie a tongue of crimson to the head of the scapegoat? From (Isaiah 1:18): \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as wool.\" [They would tie a kind of tongue of red wool, half to the head of the scapegoat and half to the peak from which it was cast. When it was cast down, that tongue would turn white, and they would know that their sins had been atoned.]",

And the atmosphere of a private domain is (regarded as) a private domain, until the heavens. And the thickness of the walls of a private domain is regarded as that domain. And a public domain — marketplaces, thoroughfares, deserts and the roads leading to them, this, on condition that the road be sixteen cubits wide, unroofed, and (in the view of some) that six hundred thousand cross it everyday, as in the instance of the flags of the desert. And the atmosphere of the public domain is regarded as that domain only up to a height of ten cubits. Above that in the public domain it is regarded as makom p'tur (\"a place of exemption\"). And a place lacking four by four, higher than three cubits is a makom p'tur. Even thorns, thistles, and dung in a public domain, higher than three and lacking four by four is a makom p'tur. Likewise, a place surrounded by walls and lacking four by four, or a hole lacking four by four, from a depth of three cubits until the tehom (the interior of the earth) is a makom p'tur.

If he were born ben hashmashoth on Sabbath eve, he is circumcised on the tenth day.

Therefore, he has to wait until after Shabbath, until the tenth day.] If yom tov (a festival) fell out after Shabbath, [milah out of its time does not override it, so that] he is circumcised on the eleventh day.

Yehudah says: If [those fruits were designated] to be eaten, what issues from them is permitted, for he does not desire what flows from them, so that there is no reason to decree that he might squeeze them]; and if to extract their juice, [in which instance, he desires what issued from them], it is forbidden, [a decree, lest he squeeze them. And with olives and grapes R. Yehudah concedes to the sages that even though he designated them for eating, what issued from them is forbidden. For since they are generally squeezed, if juice come out, he desires it. And with other fruits the sages concede to R. Yehudah (that what issues from them is permitted). They differ only in respect to berries and pomegranates, R. Yehudah comparing them to other fruits, and the sages to olives and grapes. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah.] If honeycombs were broken on Sabbath eve, and the honey issued forth of itself, it is forbidden. R. Eliezer permits it. [When honeycombs are broken, the honey flows from the wax of itself, and it is not customary to squeeze them. And the sages forbid it — a decree, by reason of those that are not already broken. The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer.]",

Yehudah. R. Yossi permits it, [this not being the conventional opening. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.] And he may not puncture it from its side. [That is, R. Yossi permits puncturing it only from the top, at the head of the stopper, it not being customary to fashion an opening there, but rather to remove the entire stopper. But, on the side, sometimes one does puncture the side of the stopper to make an opening (not wanting to open it on top so that pebbles or sand not fall into the wine.)] And if it were punctured, he is not permitted to place wax upon it, this being memareach (\"smearing\") [forbidden by reason of memachek (\"erasing\")]. R. Yehudah said: Such an instance [placing wax, etc.] came before R. Yochanan b. Zakkai in Arav, and he said: \"I fear that he might be liable for a sin-offering\" [if he smeared wax to fasten it to the walls of the vessel around the hole.]",

This is what is meant: \"One may cast lots with his children and with his household members at the table, even a large portion against a small portion — but only with his children and household members and not with others. And only if he not intend a large portion against a small portion.\" It is only then that it is forbidden on a festival and permitted on a weekday. But if he intends a large portion against a small portion, it is forbidden even on a weekday, because of gambling. For this is akin to theft, and asmachta (\"reliance\") does not effect acquisition. This instance is one of asmachta, for he \"relies\" on the lot's falling on the large portion, for which reason he acquiesces in the possibility of its falling on the small portion, too. But if he knew ab initio that this would occur, he would not acquiesce.] And it is permitted to cast lots (chalashim) on a festival [upon offerings that were slaughtered on the festival, for distribution among the Cohanim.

[Abba Shaul here differs with the first tanna, who forbids all waiting for dark, making no distinction between doing so for a mitzvah or for a mundane activity. He comes to tell us that waiting for dark for a mitzvah is permitted. For just as it is permitted to tell one's fellow on Shabbath: \"Be ready (after Shabbath) to go to bring a casket and burial shrouds for one who has died,\" so is it permitted to wait for dark at the tchum in order to do so after dark.

There were windows which opened from the houses to the path, and they feared lest someone die in one of the houses and the tumah (dead-body uncleanliness) go from the window to the path and from the path to the other house by way of the open window. They, therefore, stopped up the window facing the house of the tumah with a tafiach with its back to the path (an earthenware vessel not acquiring tumah from the back and thus serving as a partition against tumah). For they feared that the cleft in the gigith might be less than a handbreadth, in which instance the gigith would \"tent\" the path and the uncleanliness would come by way of the path from one house to the other. Afterwards, they had to open the window and take out the stopper, and they wanted to determine whether the cleft in the gigith were a handbreadth (or more) — in which instance there would not be a tent in that path for the conducting of the tumah, for the tumah would leave the path upwards by way of the cleft in the gigith — or whether it were less than a handbreadth, in which instance the path would act as a \"tent\" and conduct the tumah from house to house. They, therefore, measured a mekeidah, tied it with gemi, and extended it to the top (of the gigith) to see whether or not the cleft were a handbreadth.] And from what they prescribed we learned that we stop up, and measure, and tie on Shabbath [so long as it not be a permanent knot and the measurement be for mitzvah or to the end of a halachic ruling.]"
