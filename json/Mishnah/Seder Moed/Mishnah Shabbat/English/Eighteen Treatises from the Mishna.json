One may not light with moss [that grows in] cedars, nor with uncombed flax, nor with raw silk, nor with willow bast, nor with desert fiber, nor with weeds [growing] on water.  Nor [may one light] with pitch, nor with wax, nor with castor oil, nor oil set for burning [consecrated oil that has become impure], nor with [the fat from] sheeps' tails, nor with forbidden fat. Nachum HaMadi says: One may light with boiled forbidden fat; but the Sages say: One may not light with forbidden fat whether it's boiled or not boiled.",
            "One may not light with oil set for burning on festivals. Rabbi Yishmael says: Out of respect for Shabbat, one may not light with tar, but the Sages permit all [of the following] oils: Sesame oil, nut oil, radish [seed] oil, fish oil, gourd [seed] oil, tar, and naphtha. Rabbi Tarfon says: One may only light olive oil.",
            "Of tree products, one may light only with flax. Of tree products, only flax [fashioned into a] shelter can contract impurity [if it surrounds a corpse]. [If] a slip of cloth has been folded but not singed, Rabbi Eleizer says it is subject to impurity and one may not light with it. Rabbi Akiva says:It is not subject to impurity [literally: it is pure], and one may light with it.",
            "One may not perforate an eggshell, and fill it with oil, and place it over the lamp, so that it [oil] drips [therein], even if it is [made] of earthenware, but Rabbi Yehudah permits it. But if the potter had originally joined it, it is permissible because it is  one utensil. One may not fill a bowl [with] oil and place it beside the lamp, and put the end of the wick into it, so that it draws [the oil], but Rabbi Yehudah permits it.",
            "[If] one extinguishes the lamp because he is afraid of non-Jews, of bandits, of an evil spirit, or that the sick may sleep, he is exempt; but [if his intention is] to preserve the lamp, to preserve the oil, or to preserve the wick, he is liable. Rabbi Yose permits all [these cases] except the [act preserving the wick], because he thereby creates a coal.",
            "Women die in childbirth for three transgressions: If they are not careful with [the laws] of menstruation; and if they are not careful [to separate some] dough [when baking to give to the priest]; and if they are not careful with the lighting of the [Shabbat] lamp.",
            "At dusk on the eve of shabbat, a man must make three statements: Have you separated the tithe? Have you prepared the <i>Eruv</i> [the halachic merging of separate domains by means of setting aside an amount of food in a designated place]?  Light the lamps! If it is uncertain whether it is night [dark] or not, one may not tithe [produce that is] certainly untithed; and one may not immerse vessels [in a <i>Mikveh</i>]; and one may not light the lamps.  One may [however] tithe <i>Demai</i> [produce from which it is uncertain whether tithes were already taken]; and one may prepare the <i>Eruv</i>, and one may cover [pots] of hot food [to retain their heat.]"

Beit Shammai say: [One may place] hot water [on such a stove] but not cooked food; but Beit Hillel say: [One may place both] hot water and cooked food [there].  Beit Shammai: One may remove [a pot from the stove], but may not return [it]; but Beit Hillel say: One may even return [it].",
            "[If] an oven is fueled with straw or stubble, one may not put anything either into it or on its outside [surface].  A single [pot] stove which is fueled with straw or stubble is considered like a double stove; but [if fueled] with peat or wood is considered like an oven.",
            "One may not put an egg at the side of a hot kettle such that it becomes cooked, nor may one crack it in hot cloths, but Rabbi Yose permits that.  One may not bury it in sand, or dust of the road such that it becomes roasted.",
            "It once happened that the inhabitants of Tiberias ran a pipe of cold water through a channel of hot water.  The Sages said to them: If [the cold water is heated] on Shabbat, it is like any water that has been heated on Shabbat and is prohibited for either washing or drinking; [if this water is heated] on a festival, it is  like any hot water that has been heated on the festival and is prohibited for washing but permitted for drinking. One may drink from an external coal-chamber samovar that has been swept [of coals] on Shabbat.  One may not drink from an internal coal-chamber samovar even though it has been swept [of coals].",
            "One may not place cold water into a kettle that has been removed [from the fire], so that the [cold water] heats up; but one may pour cold water into it [a kettle] or a cup of [hot water]  to cool it down.  One may not put spices into a boiling pan or into a pot that has been removed [from the fire], but one may put [spices] into a bowl or a serving pot.  Rabbi Yehudah says: One may put [spices] into any [vessel], except into [a pot that contains food with] vinegar or brine. ",
            "One may not place a vessel beneath a lamp to catch the oil [that may drip], but if it was placed [there] during the day [before Shabbat], it is permitted [to collect the oil].  [Nevertheless,] one may not benefit from [the oil caught therein], because it was not set aside [before Shabbat]. A new lamp may be moved [on Shabbat], but an old one [that has already been used] may not be. Rabbi Shimon says: One may move all lamps except such as are alight on Shabbat.  A vessel may be placed beneath a lamp to catch the sparks, but one may not put water therein because he thereby extinguishes [the sparks]."

He-goats may go out with a leather bandage round their privates; sheep with their tails fastened up or down, and with wrapper; sire-goats with their udders tied up. R. Jose prohibits all these, excepting the sheep with wrapper. R. Jehudah saith, \"She-goats may go out with their udders tied up, if [this be done] to dry [up the milk], but not if it be done to [preserve the] milk.\"",

The camel must not go out with a rag tied to its tail, nor with its legs strapped, nor with its fore and hind-legs fastened together; this [applies] to all domestic animals. A man must not fasten camels together and lead them, but he may hold the [different] ropes in his hand, only [taking care] that they do not get twisted.",
            "An ass must not go out with its rug that had not been fastened on [before the Sabbath], nor with a bell, although it be muffled, nor with a wooden frame-work round its neck, nor with a strap to its legs. Hens must not go out with cords tied on them, nor with straps to their feet. Rams must not go out with go-carts to their tails; nor sheep with sneezing-wood; nor calves with a reed-yoke; nor a cow with the skin of a hedgehog tied to her udders, nor with a strap between her horns. The cow of R. Eleazar hen Azariah went out [on the Sabbath] with a strap between her horns, which was against the consent of the sages."

And one may draw lots with his children and household at the table [for choice foods] provided he does not intend to stake a large portion against a small one on account of dice playing. And they may draw lots for the sacrifices on the festival, but not for the portions [of the preceding day].",
            "A person may not hire laborers on Shabbat, nor may one instruct another to hire laborers for him. One may not await nightfall [Shabbat to end] at the Shabbat [travel] boundary in order to hire laborers or to bring produce; but one may await nightfall at the Shabbat boundary in order to guard [his produce] and he may bring produce [home] with him. Abba Shaul stated a principle: [If] I am permitted to instruct about something, I am permitted to await nightfall for it.",
            "One may await nightfall at the Shabbat boundary to oversee requirements for a bride or requirements for a corpse - to bring him a coffin and shrouds. [If] a gentile brings flutes on Shabbat a Jew may not mourn [play] them unless they were brought from the vicinity. If they [gentiles] prepared a coffin for him [a gentile], or dug a grave for him, a Jew may be buried therein; but if [it was prepared] for a Jew, he may never be buried therein.",
            "One may perform all the requirements for a corpse [on Shabbat]: [One may] anoint and wash him, provided one does not move a limb. One may move the pillow from under him to place him on the sand so that he will keep [from decomposing].  One may tie his jaw, not so that it rises but so it does not fall.  And similarly, [if] a beam has broken one may support it with a bench or boards from a bed, not so that it rises but so it does not fall. One may not close the eyes of a corpse on Shabbat, nor [even] on a week-day while he is [still] expiring. [If] one closes the eyes of a dying person while he is [still] expiring he has shed blood."

            "[If] one is overtaken by nightfall on the road [on Friday] he gives his wallet to a gentile.  And if there is no gentile with him he places it on the donkey. [When] he arrives at the outer courtyard he may remove those items that may be moved on Shabbat.  [With regard to] those items that may not be moved on Shabbat, he loosens the cords and the parcels fall off by    themselves. ",
            "One may loosen bundles of straw before animals [on Shabbat] and may separate fresh branches but not bundles tied with three ties. One may not chop young grain or carob before animals regardless of whether they are large or small animals. Rabbi Yehudah allows one to cut up carob before small animals.",
            "One may not stuff a camel or force feed it, but one may put food into its mouth. One may not stuff calves, but one may put food into their mouths. One may put food into the mouths of chickens, and one may pour water into their bran, but may not knead it. And one may not put water before bees or before pigeons in a dovecote, but one may put [food] before geese and chickens and before Herodian doves.",
            "One may cut up pumpkins before animals and a carcass before a dog. Rabbi Yehudah says: If it was not a carcass on Shabbat eve [Friday, the animal had not yet died] it is forbidden [to cut it up] because it had not been prepared.  ",
            "One may annul vows on Shabbat, and may consult [a sage] regarding vows related to Shabbat needs. One may stop up a window, and one may measure a strip and a ritual bath‎. It once happened in the days of Rabbi Zadok's father and in the days of Abba Shaul ben Batnit, that they stopped up a window with a pitcher and tied a fire pot with reed grass to ascertain whether  or not there was an opening of a square hand-breadth in the barrel. And from their words we learn that [in some circumstances] one may stop up, and one may measure, and one may tie on Shabbat."
