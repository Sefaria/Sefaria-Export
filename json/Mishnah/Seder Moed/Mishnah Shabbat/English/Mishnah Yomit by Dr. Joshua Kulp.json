            "The carryings out of Shabbat are two which are four from the inside, and two which are four from the outside. How is this so? The poor man stands outside and the householder stands inside:If the poor man reaches his hand inside and places [something] into the hand of the householder, or if he takes [something] from it and carries it out, the poor man is liable, and the householder is exempt. If the householder reaches his hand outside and places [an object] in the poor man's hand, or takes [something] and carries it in, the master is liable, while the poor man is exempt. If the poor man reaches his hand inside and the master takes [an object] from it, or places [an object] in it and he carries it out, both are exempt; If the householder stretches his hand outside and the poor man takes [an object] from it, or places [an article] in it and he carries it inside, both are exempt.",
            "One may not sit down before a barber near Minhah until he has prayed. One may not enter the baths or a tannery, or [sit down] to eat or [begin] a court case. But if they began, they need not break off. One must break off for the reading of the Shema, but not for prayer.",
            "A tailor must not go out with his needle near nightfall, lest he forget and go out. Nor a scribe with his quill. And one may not search his garments [for lice or fleas], nor read by the light of a lamp. In truth it was said, the hazzan may see where the children are reading from, but he himself must not read. Similarly, a zav must not eat together with a zavah, because it may lead to sin.",
            "And these are of halakhot which they stated in the upper chamber of Hananiah ben Hezekiah ben Gurion, when they went up to visit him. They took a count, and Bet Shammai outnumbered Beth Hillel and on that day they enacted eighteen measures.",

But Bet Hillel permits it. Bet Shammai says: traps for wild beasts, fowl, and fish may not be spread unless they can be caught while it is still day; But Bet Hillel permits it.",
            "Bet Shammai says: one must not sell [something] to a non-Jew, or help him to load [a donkey], or lift up [an article] upon him unless he can reach a near place [before Shabbat]. But Bet Hillel permits it.",
            "Bet Shammai says: hides must not be given to a [non-Jewish] tanner, nor clothing to a non-Jewish launderer, unless they can be done while it is yet day; But in all these [cases] Bet Hillel, permits as long as the sun is still shining.",
            "Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said: My father’s house was accustomed to giving white clothing to a non-Jewish launderer three days before Shabbat. And these and these agree that they lay down an olive press beams and wine press rollers.",

Bread may not be put into an oven just before nightfall, nor a cake upon coals, unless its surface can form a crust while it is still day. Rabbi Eliezer says: there must be time for the bottom to form a crust.",

But in the provinces there must be time for the fire to take hold of its greater part. Rabbi Judah says: in the case of charcoal, just a little [is sufficient]. "

Nahum the Mede says: they may kindle with melted tallow. And the sages say: whether melted or not, they may not kindle with it.",
            "They may not kindle [the Shabbat light] with [terumah] oil [which must be] burnt on festivals. Rabbi Ishmael says: they may not light with tar, because of the honor of the Shabbat. But the sages permit with all oils: with sesame oil, nut oil, radish oil, fish oil, gourd oil, tar and naphtha. Rabbi Tarfon says: they don’t light with anything but olive oil.",

A wick made of cloth which was twisted but not singed: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is unclean, and one may not light with it; Rabbi Akiva says: it is clean and one may light with it.",
            "One may not pierce an egg shell, fill it with oil, and place it over the mouth of a lamp, in order that it should drip, and even if it is of clay. And Rabbi Judah permits it. But if the potter connects it beforehand it is permitted, because it is one utensil. One may not fill a dish of oil, place it at the side of a lamp, and put the wick end in it in order that it should draw. And Rabbi Judah permits it.",
            "One who extinguishes the lamp because he is afraid of non-Jews, robbers, or an evil spirit, or so that a sick person may sleep, he is exempt. If [he does so because] he wants to spare the lamp, the oil, or the wick, he is liable. Rabbi Yose exempts in all cases, except for the wick, because he makes charcoal.",

If it is doubtful, whether it is night or not, they do not tithe that which is certainly [untithed], they do not immerse utensils, and they do not kindle the lights. But they can tithe doubtfully tithed produce, and they can set up an eruv, and they can store hot food."

If it was heated with peat or wood, one may not place [a dish on it] until he sweeps it out or covers it with ashes. Bet Shammai says: hot water, but not a dish; And Bet Hillel says: both hot water and a dish. Bet Shammai says: one may remove it, but not put it back; But Bet Hillel says: one may even put it back.",
            "If an oven was heated with stubble or straw, one may not place [a dish] either inside or on top. If a single stove was heated with stubble or straws, it is like a double stove; With peat or wood, it is like an oven.",

The sages said to them: if this happened on the Shabbat, it is like hot water heated on the Shabbat, and is forbidden both for washing and for drinking; If on a festival, it is like water heated on a festival, which is forbidden for washing but permitted for drinking. A miliarum which is cleared of its ashes--they may drink from it on Shabbat. An antiki even if its ashes have been cleared--they may not drink from it.",
            "A kettle which was removed [from the fire]: one may not pour cold water into it so that it should warm up, but one may pour it [water] into or into a cup in order to temper it. The pan or pot which was removed [from the fire] while it is boiling, one must not put spices into it, but one may put [spices] into a dish or a tureen. Rabbi Judah says: he may put [spices] into anything except what contains vinegar or brine.",
            "They may not place a vessel under a lamp to catch the oil. But if it was placed there before sunset it is permitted. Yet one may not benefit from it because it is not prepared (mukhan). They may handle a new lamp but not an old one. Rabbi Shimon says: all lamps may be handled, except a lamp [actually] burning on Shabbat. A vessel may be placed under a lamp to catch the sparks, but one must not pour water into it, because he extinguishes [them]."

They may cover up [food] in garments, produce, doves’ wings, carpenters’ sawdust and thoroughly beaten flax. Rabbi Judah forbids [storing] in fine [flax], but permits [it] in coarse [flax].",
            "They may cover up [food] with hides, and they may be handled; [They may cover up food] with wool shearings, but they may not be handled. What then is done? The lid [of the pot] is lifted, and they [the shearings] fall off of their own accord. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says: the basket [holding the pot] he turns on its side and [the food] is removed, lest one lift [the lid of the pot] and is unable to replace it. But the Sages say: one may take [out the pot] and replace [it]. If he did not cover it [a pot] while it was yet day, it may not be covered after nightfall. If it was covered but became uncovered, it may be recovered. One may fill a jug with [cold water] and place it under a pillow or blanket [to keep it cool]."

And they may sprinkle upon them [with purifying waters], and they may be immersed in their place.",

Goats may go out [with their udders] tied up. Rabbi Yose forbids in all these cases, save ewes that are covered. Rabbi Judah says: goats may go out [with their udders] tied in order to dry them up, but not to save their milk.",

One should not tie camels together and pull [one of them]. But one may take the cords in his hand and pull [them] providing he does not twist them together.",

Fowls may not go out with ribbons, or with straps on their legs. Rams may not go out with a wagon under their tails. Ewes may not go out with a hanun. A calf may not go out with a small yoke. Or a cow with the skin of a hedgehog, or with the strap between its horns. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah’s cow used to go out with a strap between its horns, not with the approval of the rabbis."

His supports are unclean through midras, and one may go out with them on Shabbat, and enter the Temple court while wearing them. His chair and its supports are unclean through midras, and one may not go out with them on Shabbat, and one may not enter the Temple court with them.

One who knows the fundamental law of Shabbat and performs many labors on many Shabbatot is liable for a sin-offering for each and every Shabbat. One who knows that it is Shabbat and performs many labors on many Shabbatot, is liable for every primary labor. One who performs many labors belonging to the same category is obligated for only one sin-offering.",

And they do not combine with each other, because they are not alike in their standards. He who carries out [human] food the size of a dried fig is liable, And they combine with each other, because they are equal in their standards, except their shells, kernels, stalks, husks and coarse bran.

            "One may not stuff a camel [with food] nor cram [food into its mouth], but one may put food into its mouth. And one may not force feed calves, but one may put food into their mouth. And one may put food into one’s hands for chickens and one may put water into bran, but not mix it [into a mass]. And one may not put water in front of bees or in front of doves in a dove-cote, but one may put [water] in front of geese, chickens and Rhodesian doves.",
            "One may cut up gourds in front of beasts, and a carcass in front of dogs. Rabbi Judah says: if it was not carcass by the eve of Shabbat it is forbidden, because it was not prepared.",
            "They may annul vows on Shabbat, and they may be asked [to release vows] when these are necessary for Shabbat. One may close up a skylight, and measure a rag and a ritual bath. And it once happened in the days of Rabbi Zadok’s father and the days of Abba Shaul ben Botnit that they closed up the window with a small clay vessel and tied a [clay] pot to a string to ascertain whether there was the opening of a handbreadth or not in the barrel. And from their words we learn that we may close [a skylight] and measure and tie on Shabbat."
