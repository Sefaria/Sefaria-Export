            "The following may [privately] shave [trim their hair] on the Moed:—he who arrives from beyond seas, or returns from captivity, or has been discharged from prison, or an excommunicated [person] whom the sages have absolved; likewise, he who has consulted a sage and been absolved, also the nazir, and the leper, who from [a state of] uncleanness is restored to cleanness.", 
            "The following may wash [their garments] on the Moed:—he who arrives from beyond seas, or returns from captivity, or has been discharged from prison, and an excommunicated person whom the sages have absolved; also, he who consulted a sage, and by him had been absolved. Towels, barber's napkins, and bathing-towels [may be washed during the Moed]. Men and women who have had a running issue; women after their courses or lying-in; [in short] all [persons] who from [a state of] uncleanness are restored to cleanness, are permitted [to wash their garments], but all other persons are forbidden [so to do].", 
            "The following [documents] may be written during the Moed: contracts of betrothing, bills of divorce, and receipts [in discharge of debts]; also wills or codicils, deeds of gift, premonitions, appraisements, and deeds of maintenance, certificates of ‏חליצה‎,  and of refusal, arbitration-bonds, decrees of the Beth Din, and powers of attorney.", 
            "They must not write bonds [to secure payment] of debts during the Moed; but if he [the lender] has no faith in him [the borrower], or if he has nothing to eat, then [the bond] may he written. They must not write rolls of the Law, Tephilin, or Mezoozoth, during the Moed, and must not correct a single letter even in the roll of the law of ‏עזרא‎, (Ezra), [another version has of the ‏עזרה‎, Azarah, outer court of the Temple 14]. R. Jehudah saith, \"A man may write Tephilin and Mezoozoth for his own use, and he may also spin sky blue wool for Zizith, in his lap.\"", 
            "He who buried his dead [relative] three days before the commencement of the festival, is freed from the seven [days of deep mourning]; if [he buried his dead] eight days [before the festival], he is freed from the thirty [days of mourning], because they [the sages] held that the Sabbath enters [into the computation], but does not supersede [the mourning, whereas] the festivals supersede [the mourning], but do not enter [into the computation].", 
            "R. Eleazar saith, \"Since the destruction of the Temple, the festival of weeks [Pentecost] is [in respect to mourning, to be considered] like the Sabbath.\" R. Gamaliel saith, \"The new year and the day of atonement are [to be considered] like festivals;\" but the sages hold not with the dictum of the one or of the other, but [decide that] the festival of weeks is like other festivals, and the new year and day of atonement are like the Sabbath.\"", 
            "They are not to rend their garments, nor lay bare their shoulder, 17 not eat the funeral-meal [during the Moed], unless they be near relatives of the deceased; the funeral-meal is not to be taken except on a couch, standing up properly. [The food for such a meal] is not placed before the mourners on a table, nor in a silver tureen, nor in a dish, but in wicker baskets. The mourning prayer must not be said during the Moed, but the rows are formed, and the [usual form of] consolation is pronounced, and the people assembled are at once dismissed.", 
            "They must not set down [rest] the bier in any public place, that the mourning may not spread. The bier of women [must] at no time [be there set down], on account of [the] respect [due to the sex of the deceased]. The mourning-women may wail during the Moed, but not clap [their palms together]. R. Ishmael saith, \"Those nearest to the bier, may clap [the palms of their hands together].\"", 
            "On the festivals of the new moon, of dedication, and of purim, they [the mourning-women] may wail [aloud] and clap [the palms of their hands together], but must not sing lamentations [funeral dirges]; but when the corpse is interred, they must neither wail aloud, nor sing dirges. What is [meant by the expression] wailing? When all of them join in one chorus. What is [meant by the expression] lamentation [dirge]? When one recites and the others respond [or repeat after her], as it is said, \"Teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation.\" But of future [ages] that are to come it is said, \"Death shall be swallowed [destroyed] for ever, and the Lord will wipe away tears from off all faces,\" &amp;c"
