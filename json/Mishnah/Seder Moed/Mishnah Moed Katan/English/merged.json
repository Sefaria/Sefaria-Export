            "Dry land may be irrigated on the Moed, and also during the Sabbatical year, as well from a fountain that is newly sprung forth, as from one that is not newly sprung forth; but they must not irrigate it with rain-water, nor with water [drawn] from a deep well; nor may they make [dig] trenches [to hold water] round vines.", 
            "R. Eleazar ben Azariah saith, \"They must not make [dig] a fresh trench [conduit, or water course] on the Moed, or during the Sabbatical year.\" But the sages hold, that a fresh trench [water course] may be dug during the Sabbatical year, and that those [conduits] which are choked up, may be repaired on the Moed. They may [likewise] repair water reservoirs [which are] in the public reshuth, and cleanse them: They may also repair the roads [streets], the market [public] places, and the spring-baths. In short, they may do whatever the exigencies of the public [service] require. They may mark [whitewash] tombs, and even send out [inspectors] of Kilaim.", 
            "R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, \"They may lead water from tree to tree, provided always the whole orchard be not irrigated; plants which have not imbibed [water] before the Moed, must not be irrigated during the Moed.\" But the sages permit the one and the other.", 
            "They may [by means of gins and pit-falls] catch moles and field-mice in orchards and fields, but they must not [do this] in the [usual] way, both on the Moed and during the Sabbatical year. But the sages hold that in an orchard [the vermin may he caught] in the [usual] way, but that in a corn-field [it must] not [be caught] in the [usual] way. During the Moed they may pile [loose stones to stop] a gap [in a fence], but during the Sabbatical year they repair it in the [ordinary] way.", 
            "R. Meir saith, \"Priests make the first inspection of the plague [of leprosy] in order to relieve [the patient], but not to restrict [him].\" But the sages decide neither to relieve nor to restrict [in no case is such an inspection to be undertaken during the Moed]. R. Meir [further] saith, \"A man may collect the bones of his father and mother [during the Moed, to inter them], because it is a satisfaction to him [relieves his mind].\" But R. José saith, \"It is a grief to him [afflicts his mind]. Man is not to excite [others to mourn] over his dead, nor hold a funeral oration for thirty days before the festival.\"", 
            "They must not dig graves or burial vaults on the Moed, but they may prepare [enlarge] graves [previously dug] on the Moed, and also make a washing pit during the Moed, and a coffin in the same court where the corpse lies. [This, however,] R. Jehudah prohibits, unless the boards have been [previously] provided.", 
            "They must not espouse wives on the Moed, neither virgins nor widows; nor must they be ‏מיבם‎, as that [the espousal] is a cause of joy to him individually, but he may receive back his own divorced wife. A woman may prepare her ornaments on the Moed. R. Jehudah saith, \"She must not apply lime [chalk as a cosmetic], because it [may] disfigure her.\"", 
            "An ordinary person [who is not of the craft] may sew [make stitches] in the [regular] way; but the craftsman [whose trade it is to sew, must only do it] zigzag [during the Moed]. They may twine [the ropes in the sacking of] bedsteads. R. José saith, \"[They may] only tighten [the ropes].\"", 
            "They may erect an oven, or a hearth, or a mill, on the Moed [for the use of the festival]. R. Jehudah saith, \"New millstones must not be chipped.\"", 
            "A railing [balustrade] may be made round a roof, or gallery [according to the] workmanship of common men, but not [according to the] workmanship of [regular] craftsmen. Rents [in the roof] may also be closed, and [then] smoothened with a roller, or with hand and foot, but not with a trowel. Should the hinges of the door-frame, or the beam, or the lock [of the door], or the key [thereto], have been broken, they may be repaired on the Moed, provided always he does not intentionally put off the repairs till the Moed. All [kinds of] pickled food of which he can eat during the Moed, may be pickled."

            "He who has turned his olives, 1 and [then] has a death [in his family], or [otherwise] is prevented [from at once putting them to press], or has been disappointed by his labourers, may put the first press-block on [the olives], and leaves it [thereon] until after the Moed. Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but R. José saith, \"He may put [the olives] into the oil press, and finish pressing [them], and bung up [the casks into which the oil is poured] in the usual manner.\"", 
            "Thus, likewise, he whose wine [has been pressed but still] is in the press-pit, should he [then] have a death in his family, or be [otherwise] prevented, or have been disappointed by his labourers, he may pour [the wine into casks], cooper, and bung them up in the usual manner. Such is the dictum of R. José: but R. Jehudah saith, \"He must only cover [the pit] with boards, so that the wine may not grow sour.\"", 
            "A man may house his fruit from [dread of] thieves, and take flax out of the buck, that it be not spoiled, provided always he does not intentionally defer doing it till the Moed: but should he have intentionally deferred doing it till the Moed, then in all these cases he forfeits [the article in question].", 
            "They must not purchase houses, slaves, or cattle, excepting for the use of the festival, or for the use of the vendor, who otherwise might have nothing to eat. They must not clear away [remove things] from one house to another, though this may be done if both houses are in the same court. Things [which have been put into the hands of a craftsman to be made up or repaired] must not be brought home from the workshop, but if he [the owner] suspects [that the things, if left with the workman, may be lost, or that he may exact a second payment] he may remove them to another court.", 
            "They may cover dried figs with straw. R. Jehudah saith, \"[They may] likewise [be put] in layers.\" Dealers in fruit, in garments, or in utensils, may privately sell what is required for use on the Moed. Huntsmen [fishers], and manufacturers of peeled barley and grits, may carry on their occupations in private, as the exigencies of the festival may require. R. José said, \"They have of their own accord adopted the more rigorous observance, and do not carry on their occupation during the Moed.\""

            "The following may [privately] shave [trim their hair] on the Moed:—he who arrives from beyond seas, or returns from captivity, or has been discharged from prison, or an excommunicated [person] whom the sages have absolved; likewise, he who has consulted a sage and been absolved, also the nazir, and the leper, who from [a state of] uncleanness is restored to cleanness.", 
            "The following may wash [their garments] on the Moed:—he who arrives from beyond seas, or returns from captivity, or has been discharged from prison, and an excommunicated person whom the sages have absolved; also, he who consulted a sage, and by him had been absolved. Towels, barber's napkins, and bathing-towels [may be washed during the Moed]. Men and women who have had a running issue; women after their courses or lying-in; [in short] all [persons] who from [a state of] uncleanness are restored to cleanness, are permitted [to wash their garments], but all other persons are forbidden [so to do].", 
            "The following [documents] may be written during the Moed: contracts of betrothing, bills of divorce, and receipts [in discharge of debts]; also wills or codicils, deeds of gift, premonitions, appraisements, and deeds of maintenance, certificates of ‏חליצה‎,  and of refusal, arbitration-bonds, decrees of the Beth Din, and powers of attorney.", 
            "They must not write bonds [to secure payment] of debts during the Moed; but if he [the lender] has no faith in him [the borrower], or if he has nothing to eat, then [the bond] may he written. They must not write rolls of the Law, Tephilin, or Mezoozoth, during the Moed, and must not correct a single letter even in the roll of the law of ‏עזרא‎, (Ezra), [another version has of the ‏עזרה‎, Azarah, outer court of the Temple 14]. R. Jehudah saith, \"A man may write Tephilin and Mezoozoth for his own use, and he may also spin sky blue wool for Zizith, in his lap.\"", 
            "He who buried his dead [relative] three days before the commencement of the festival, is freed from the seven [days of deep mourning]; if [he buried his dead] eight days [before the festival], he is freed from the thirty [days of mourning], because they [the sages] held that the Sabbath enters [into the computation], but does not supersede [the mourning, whereas] the festivals supersede [the mourning], but do not enter [into the computation].", 
            "R. Eleazar saith, \"Since the destruction of the Temple, the festival of weeks [Pentecost] is [in respect to mourning, to be considered] like the Sabbath.\" R. Gamaliel saith, \"The new year and the day of atonement are [to be considered] like festivals;\" but the sages hold not with the dictum of the one or of the other, but [decide that] the festival of weeks is like other festivals, and the new year and day of atonement are like the Sabbath.\"", 
            "They are not to rend their garments, nor lay bare their shoulder, 17 not eat the funeral-meal [during the Moed], unless they be near relatives of the deceased; the funeral-meal is not to be taken except on a couch, standing up properly. [The food for such a meal] is not placed before the mourners on a table, nor in a silver tureen, nor in a dish, but in wicker baskets. The mourning prayer must not be said during the Moed, but the rows are formed, and the [usual form of] consolation is pronounced, and the people assembled are at once dismissed.", 
            "They must not set down [rest] the bier in any public place, that the mourning may not spread. The bier of women [must] at no time [be there set down], on account of [the] respect [due to the sex of the deceased]. The mourning-women may wail during the Moed, but not clap [their palms together]. R. Ishmael saith, \"Those nearest to the bier, may clap [the palms of their hands together].\"", 
            "On the festivals of the new moon, of dedication, and of purim, they [the mourning-women] may wail [aloud] and clap [the palms of their hands together], but must not sing lamentations [funeral dirges]; but when the corpse is interred, they must neither wail aloud, nor sing dirges. What is [meant by the expression] wailing? When all of them join in one chorus. What is [meant by the expression] lamentation [dirge]? When one recites and the others respond [or repeat after her], as it is said, \"Teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation.\" But of future [ages] that are to come it is said, \"Death shall be swallowed [destroyed] for ever, and the Lord will wipe away tears from off all faces,\" &amp;c"
