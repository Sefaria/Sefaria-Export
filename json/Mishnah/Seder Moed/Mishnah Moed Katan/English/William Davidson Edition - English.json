            "<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: One may not construct a new</b> water <b>channel during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival or during the Sabbatical Year. And the Rabbis say: One may construct a new</b> water <b>channel during the Sabbatical Year and one may repair damaged</b> water channels <b>during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b> In addition to performing labor on one’s own property in order to avoid financial loss, it is also permitted to perform labor on the intermediate days of a Festival for the public welfare: <b>One may repair damaged water</b> cisterns <b>that are in the public domain, and clean them out</b> by removing the dirt and sediment that accumulated there; <b>one may repair roads, streets, and ritual baths; and one may tend to all</b> other <b>public needs.</b> So too, <b>one may mark graves</b> to inform the public of their ritual impurity, <b>and</b> inspectors <b>may even go out to</b> uproot <b>the</b> shoots of prohibited <b>diverse kinds</b> [<b><i>kilayim</i>]</b> that grew in the fields during the rainy season.",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In a field that is filled with trees, <b>one may draw water</b> via channels <b>from</b> one <b>tree to</b> another <b>tree</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival because trees are in dire need of water. <b>And</b> this is permitted <b>provided that</b> in doing so <b>he does not water the entire field.</b> With regard to <b>plants that were not watered prior to the Festival, one may not water them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival</b> because they do not need the water. <b>But the Rabbis permit</b> watering in <b>this</b> case, i.e., trees, <b>and that</b> case, i.e., plants.",
            "<b>One may trap moles</b> [<b><i>ishut</i></b>] <b>and mice in an orchard and in a field of grain in a way that is not his</b> usual <b>manner,</b> i.e., as he would trap them all year round, both <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival and during the Sabbatical Year.

            "When symptoms of leprosy appear, they must be examined by a priest, who determines whether or not the symptoms qualify as leprosy. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> A priest <b>may initially examine</b> an individual showing <b>symptoms of leprosy on the intermediate days of a Festival</b> in order <b>to be lenient,</b> i.e., he may pronounce the individual to be free of leprosy, <b>but not</b> in order <b>to be stringent;</b> he may not pronounce the individual to be impure. The individual does not become ritually impure until the priest pronounces him to have leprosy, and therefore the priest may remain silent and thereby prevent causing the afflicted individual distress during the Festival. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The priest may <b>not</b> examine the symptoms in order <b>to be lenient or</b> in order <b>to be stringent.</b> <b>Rabbi Meir also stated</b> another leniency concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of the intermediate days of a Festival: <b>A person may gather the bones of his father and mother</b> from their temporary graves on the intermediate days of a Festival. In ancient times, it was customary to first bury a corpse in a temporary grave. After the flesh had decomposed, the bones would be collected, placed in a coffin, and buried in a vault together with the bones of the deceased individual’s ancestors. This is permitted on the intermediate days of a Festival <b>because</b> the fact that one merited to bring the bones of his deceased parents to the graves of their ancestors <b>is</b> a source of <b>joy for him.</b> <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> One does not gather these bones on the intermediate days of a Festival, because <b>it is</b> a source of <b>mourning for him.</b> Even though he is happy to be able to bury his parents’ bones in their ancestral graves, he is still pained by the memory of their death. And all agree that <b>a person may not arouse [<i>ye’orer</i>]</b>lamentation <b>for his deceased</b> relative, <b>and he may not eulogize him</b> during the <b>thirty days before a pilgrimage Festival.</b>",
            "<b>One may not dig crypts or graves on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> in preparation for those who are still alive, <b>but one may adjust</b> previously dug <b>crypts on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> in order to receive a particular corpse. <b>And one may</b> also <b>construct</b> a laundry <b>pond on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> as it does not involve excessive effort. <b>And</b> one may also prepare <b>a coffin</b> if he is together <b>with the corpse in the</b> same <b>courtyard,</b> as in that case everyone knows that he is preparing the coffin for the deceased. <b>Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> making the coffin <b>unless</b> one <b>has</b> wooden <b>boards with him</b> that had already been cut before the Festival and that need only to be attached.",
            "<b>One may not marry a woman on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, not virgins and not widows, and one may not perform levirate marriage</b> with his sister-in-law, if his brother died childless, <b>because it is</b> a <b>joyous</b> occasion <b>for him. However, one may remarry his divorced wife</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival, as this is not as great a joy for him. <b>And a woman may engage in</b> all <b>her</b> usual <b>cosmetic treatments</b> to enhance her physical appearance <b>on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says: She may not apply lime</b> to her skin <b>because it</b> is temporarily <b>a disgrace to her,</b> as she is unattractive before the lime is peeled off and will therefore be distressed during the Festival.",
            "The mishna continues: <b>A layman,</b> who is not a skilled tailor, <b>may sew in his</b> usual <b>manner</b> if necessary for the Festival, <b>whereas a craftsman may form</b> only <b>temporary stitches. And one may interweave</b> the cords attached to the frames of <b>beds</b> upon which a mattress is placed. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One may</b> only <b>tighten</b> the cords but not interweave them.",
            "<b>One may set up an oven, a stove, and a mill on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not chisel millstones for the first time</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival.",
            "<b>One may construct a railing for a roof or a balcony</b> if it is done in a nonprofessional manner, as <b>the work of a layman, but not</b> if it is done skillfully, as <b>the work of a craftsman. One may plaster the cracks</b> in an oven <b>and roll over them with a roller,</b> a wooden tool used to smooth out clay, <b>with a hand or a foot, but not with a presser,</b> a tool that is specially designed for this task. With regard to <b>the hinge</b> of a door, <b>and the cylinder</b> of the hinge, <b>and the</b> cross <b>beam</b> that holds the door, <b>and a lock and a key that broke, one may fix them on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival</b> as these items are essential for the Festival and their repair cannot be delayed. This is permitted, <b>provided that he does not intend</b> ahead of time <b>to do his labor on the Festival</b> and delay it until that time. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all preserved food from which one can eat on the Festival,</b> since they become ready to be eaten in a short amount of time, <b>he</b> may <b>preserve them</b> on the intermediate days of a Festival."

            "The mishna discusses <b>one who had</b> already <b>turned over his olives</b> as part of the process of preparing them for pressing, <b>and mourning</b> for a close relative <b>befell him</b> and as a result he was prohibited from engaging in work, <b>or</b> some other <b>unavoidable accident</b> occurred, <b>or</b> his <b>workers misled him,</b> promising to come but failing to do so, so that he could not press his olives before the Festival. Under these circumstances, during the intermediate days of the Festival, <b>he may</b> place the olives in the press and <b>load the beam</b> with weights for the <b>initial</b> pressing of the olives and <b>leave it</b> this way <b>until after the Festival;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> <b>Rabbi Yosei says: He may press</b> the olives <b>and complete</b> the process <b>and</b> then <b>plug</b> each barrel of oil <b>in its</b> usual <b>manner.</b> Since delay can entail financial loss, the Sages did not require him to alter the normal process of extracting the oil.",
            "<b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one whose wine was</b> already <b>in the</b> collection <b>pit</b> beside the wine press and needed to be removed lest it sour, <b>and mourning</b> for some close relative <b>or</b> some other <b>unavoidable accident befell him, or</b> his workers <b>misled him,</b> promising to come but failing to do so, during the intermediate days of the Festival <b>he may draw off</b> the wine <b>and complete</b> the process, <b>and</b> then <b>plug</b> each barrel of wine <b>in its</b> usual <b>manner;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.

            "On the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>figs</b> that were spread out to dry <b>may be covered with straw</b> to protect them from rain and dew. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may even condense</b> the figs. <b>Those who sell produce, clothing, and utensils may sell</b> them <b>in private, for the sake of the Festival. Fishermen, and groats makers [<i>dashoshot</i>], and</b> bean <b>pounders,</b> who pulverize the beans, <b>may ply</b> their trades <b>in private for the sake of the Festival.

He is not required to complete this seven-day mourning period after the Festival.

            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From the time that the Temple was destroyed, <i>Shavuot</i> is like Shabbat,</b> because nowadays the days following <i>Shavuot</i> are not treated like Festival days.

Nowadays, however, when offerings are no longer sacrificed, <i>Shavuot</i> lasts for only one day in Eretz Yisrael, and therefore it is treated like Shabbat with regard to mourning: It counts as one of the days of mourning, but does not interrupt the period of mourning. <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> Even <b>Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur</b> are considered <b>like</b> the <b>pilgrimage Festivals,</b> in that they interrupt the mourning period but are not counted toward the days of mourning. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>is neither in accordance with the statement of</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>nor in accordance with the statement of </b> Rabban Gamliel. <b>Rather,</b> with regard to mourning, <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> is treated <b>like the</b> other <b>pilgrimage Festivals,</b> whereas <b>Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur</b> are treated <b>like Shabbat.</b>",
