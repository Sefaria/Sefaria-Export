(The targum of (Deuteronomy 25:18): \"faint and weary\" is \"meshalhei ul'ei.\")] may be watered on Chol Hamoed and on shevi'ith. [For essential work is permitted on Chol Hamoed. And beth hashlachin, from the time one begins watering it, if it is not regularly watered, it is immediately \"lost.\" As we learn below (1:3): \"Seeds which were not watered before Chol Hamoed may not be watered on Chol Hamoed,\" for they do not go lost. But if they were watered before Chol Hamoed, they may be watered on Chol Hamoed. And it is only an irrigated grain field which may be watered on Chol Hamoed, but not an irrigated tree field, for it will not suffer loss. And on shevi'ith it is permitted to water beth hashlachin and beth haba'al (a naturally watered field), \"beth hashlachin\" being stated vis-à-vis Chol Hamoed alone.] (It may be watered) both from a just started spring, and from an old one [and we do not fear that since it was just started perhaps its banks will fall in and he might come to shore it up on Chol Hamoed and exert himself unduly.] But it may be watered neither from rain water, [a decree by reason of kilon water] nor from kilon water [\"kilon\" is water from a deep pit in which rain water is collected, the drawing up of which entails much exertion.], and ugioth may not be made for vines. [\"ugioth\" are ruts dug at the roots of olive trees or vines to be filled with water.]",
            "\tR. Elazar b. Azaryah says: It is forbidden to make an amah [an irrigation ditch (so called because it is a cubit (amah) wide and a cubit high)] ab initio on Chol Hamoed [(If it were never there, it is not made ab initio on Chol Hamoed, for doing so entails undue exertion)], and on shevi'ith, [for it gives the impression that he is digging the soil on shevi'ith]. The sages say: An amah may be made ab initio on shevi'ith, and the defective ones may be repaired on Chol Hamoed [If soil fell in and impeded the flow, this may be corrected, but they (the amoth) may not be made ab initio on Chol Hamoed. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.], and water obstructions in [drinking troughs] in the public domain may be cleared and they (the troughs) may be cleansed [of pebbles, chips, and clods that fell therein.] And it is permitted to repair the roads, the thoroughfares, and the mikva'oth, and to tend to all public needs. And it is permitted to mark graves [They would crumble lime and spill it on the grave to serve as a sign to the passersby not to pass through a place of uncleanliness.], and they would also go out for kilayim. [Messengers of beth-din would go out to see if the fields had been sown with kilayim (forbidden admixtures) and to uproot them. For they received their wage from the lishkah contributions, and they could be hired cheap on Chol Hamoed, for they were idle then.]",
            "\tR. Eliezer b. Yaakov says: Water may be routed from [under one] tree to [a different] tree, [for this does not entail too much exertion], so long as he does not water the entire field. [We are speaking of a beth haba'al field, which does not deteriorate (by not being watered), for the rains suffice for it; it is just that when it is watered, it is richer.] Seeds which were not watered before Chol Hamoed, [not perishing (by not being watered)] may not be watered on Chol Hamoed. The sages permit it in both instances, [i.e., even if they were not watered, and even with a beth haba'al, the sages permitting enrichment. The halachah is in accordance with R. Eliezer b. Yaakov, for the anonymous Mishnah (1:1) is in accordance with him. However, a moist field, whose soil is viscid, may be watered on Chol Hamoed even according to R. Eliezer b. Yaakov, being akin to \"seeds that were watered before Chol Hamoed.\"]",
            "\tMoles, [which ravage fields] and mice may be trapped in a tree field and in a grain field on Chol Hamoed, and on shevi'ith (but) not in the usual manner (of trapping). The sages say: In a tree field, in the usual manner, [for the loss is greater], and in a grain field, not in the usual manner. [He sticks a spit forcefully into the ground and moves it back and forth so that the hole is made \"by itself\" and not by digging. The halachah is in accordance with the sages. And in a grain field bordering a tree field, he digs normally, lest they cross over from the grain field and destroy the trees.] And a breach may be closed on Chol Hamoed [by placing stones one atop the other as in building, without lime. The \"breach\" here is that of a garden. But if the wall of one's courtyard fell, he may rebuild it in the usual manner for (protection against) thieves.] And on shevi'ith, he may rebuild it (the breached garden wall) in the usual manner.",
            "\tR. Meir says: Plague-spots are inspected [on Chol Hamoed] ab initio, for lenity [i.e., If he is clean, the Cohein says to him: \"You are clean,\" this giving him joy], but not for stringency. [If he is unclean, the Cohein remains silent and does not declare him unclean and constrain him to leave the encampment.] The sages say: Neither for lenity nor for stringency. [Being required to see if he is clean, to the end of lenity, he is also required to declare him unclean if he finds him to be so, to the end of stringency, it being written (Leviticus 13:59): \"to declare it (the plague-spot) clean or unclean,\" the Cohein not being permitted to remain silent — so that it is better that the Cohein not see him at all.] R. Meir said further: One may collect the bones of his father and mother [on Chol Hamoed in order to bury them in the proper place], this [seeing them buried in the ancestral graves] giving him pleasure. R. Yossi says: It (collecting their bones) causes him to grieve. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Meir in both instances.] One may not stir up (lamentation) over his dead one [He may not bring a eulogist to stir up lamentation over his kin, who had died many days ago, by having him go around to the kin of the deceased, as was his wont, crying out: \"Come and cry with me, all bitter of heart!\" Whereupon those whose hearts grieved them would go and wail over their kin.], and he may not eulogize him [He may not hire a eulogist to lament his kin, who had just died] thirty days before the festival. [The gemara explains that they would start saving money for the festival exigencies thirty days before the festival, when they started hearing them (the scholars) expound the halachoth of the festival. There was a possibility, then, that one might give what he had saved to the eulogist and so deprive himself of the festival joy. And some say that the dead one is not forgotten from the heart until thirty days after the eulogy.]",
            "\tOne may not dig crypts [in an underground cave] or graves [in a building] on Chol Hamoed [to bury therein one who would die later.] But crypts may be adjusted on Chol Hamoed. [If it were too long, he may shorten it; if too short, he may lengthen and widen it.] And a wash-pond [for the washing of clothing] may be made on Chol Hamoed. And a casket may be made (on Chol Hamoed) with the dead one (lying) in the courtyard (where the planks are being sawed) [but not in another courtyard, so that they not suspect him of sawing for some other purpose. This, with a man who is not well known. But with one who is well known, a casket is made for him even in the marketplace. And with us, who are so few, all men are \"well known.\"] R. Yehudah says: It is forbidden [to bring wood to saw planks ab initio for a casket], but the planks must have been there [before yom tov. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",

(Deuteronomy 16:14): \"And you shall rejoice in your festival\" — in your festival, and not in your wife.] But it is permitted to take back one's divorcée, [for one does not derive as much joy in that instance as he does in taking an entirely new wife.] And a woman may adorn herself on Chol Hamoed [e.g., She may paint her eyes, straighten her hair so that she not look unkempt, rouge her face, shave her pudenda, and the like.] R.

The reason that all except those mentioned in our Mishnah are forbidden to shave on Chol Hamoed is that they not plan to shave then, when they are free from work, and so enter the first day of the festival unshaven. And this, too, is the reason that it is forbidden to wash clothing on Chol Hamoed.]",

Hillel instituted the prozbol, a writ in which the creditor states: \"I relegate to you, so and so, the judges, (all monies owing me) so that I can collect any writ outstanding with so and so, whenever I wish\" — whereby shevi'ith no longer releases it, it being considered as if beth-din collects his debt so that it no longer comes under (Ibid. 2): \"He shall not exact it of his neighbor.\"], writs of assessment, [beth-din assessing the property of the debtor and giving it (the writ) to the creditor], writs of sustenance, [beth-din selling land for the sustenance of one's wife and daughters, this being recorded as an act of beth-din.

And if he did not observe mourning before the festival, but began his mourning on the festival, the days of the festival are not included in the shivah, but they are included in the shloshim. The reason that Shabbath is included in the shivah is that \"private\" mourning obtains therein, such as the interdict against cohabitation and against uncovering the head (i.e., taking off the mourner's wrap) and bathing in warm water, these being forbidden on Shabbath. But on the festival no laws of mourning obtain, for which reason it interrupts it entirely.

But in the time of the Temple, when one who did not celebrate the first day of Shavuoth, could celebrate all seven, as with Pesach, Shavuoth was like Pesach even vis-à-vis mourning.] R. Gamliel says: Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are like the festivals. The sages say: Neither as this one nor as the other; but Shavuoth is like the festivals and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are like Shabbath.

If one's kin died even a moment before one of these, the decree of shivah falls off. And if he died seven days before one of these yomim tovim, the decree of shloshim falls off, as stated. And the seven days of the festival are included in the shloshim. For even though we learned: \"Festivals interrupt and are not included,\" they are not included in the shivah, but they are included in the shloshim — making fourteen days. And Shemini Atzereth is a festival in itself and counted as if it were seven days — making twenty-one days; so that he counts another nine days and this suffices (to complete the shloshim). The decree of shivah: A mourner, all seven days, may not bathe, even part of his body, in warm water, and all of his body, in cold water. He is forbidden to wash his clothing, to anoint himself, to wear shoes, to cohabit, to do work, and to greet people. He must wrap his head (in mourning), he must turn over all of the beds in the house on the ground and sleep in them and not on an upright bed. He may not cut his nails with an instrument, nor the hair of his moustache, even if it interferes with his eating. He is forbidden to read in the Torah, both the written or the oral. He may not baste the rent of his garment. The decree of shloshim: From shivah until shloshim he may not wear a new garment or an ironed white garment, he may not cut his hair, he may not partake of a mundane (non-mitzvah) repast, he may not go out to trade with his friends, he may not take a wife if he already has a wife and children, and he may not sew up his (mourner's) rent.]",

One does not rend his garments on Chol Hamoed for other kin, for whom he is not obligated to mourn. This, only if he were not a sage or a G d - fearing man and a doer of mitzvoth. But all are the kin of a sage who died, and all rend their garments over him, even on Chol Hamoed, and, likewise, for one who was known to be upstanding and saintly. And all who stand at the expiration of the soul of any Jew must rend their garments, even on Chol Hamoed. Rending for father and mother is (rending of) all his garments, until he bares his heart. He tears with his hand and separates the upper edge of the garment and rends it from the outside, not inserting his hand beneath his garments as he does so. He may baste them after thirty days, but he may never sew them together. And so, with his teacher who taught him Torah. But for his other kin he tears a handbreadth of the outer garment alone. And he may rend with an instrument if he desires and he need not separate the edge, and he may insert his hand under his garments when he rends. And he bastes after shivah and sews together after shloshim. Rending is done only while standing. And there is no baring of arms and shoulders on Chol Hamoed.

Which is \"lamenting\" (inui)? All answering (onoth, i.e., lamenting) as one. (Which is) \"keening\" (kinah)? One speaking and the others answering after her, viz. (Jeremiah 9:19): \"And teach (lamednah) your daughters lamentation, and a woman her neighbor, kinah.\" [\"lamednah\" (feminine plural, for \"lamentation\") indicates (by contrast) that with \"kinah,\" one speaks and the other responds.] But, in time to come, (Isaiah 25:8): \"He will swallow up death for all eternity, and the L rd G d will wipe the tear from every face, etc.\" [And all will respond in song, there being no death and no tear. This verse (Isaiah) is adduced here by reason of (Koheleth 8:3): \"Do not stand at (i.e., conclude with) an evil thing.\"]"
