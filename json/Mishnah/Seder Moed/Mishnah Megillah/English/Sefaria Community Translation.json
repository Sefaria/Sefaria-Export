            "The <i>Megillah</i> [Scroll of Esther] is read on the eleventh, on the twelfth, on the thirteenth, on the fourteenth, [or] on the fifteenth [of Adar], not earlier and not later. Cities surrounded with walls from the days of Yehoshua son of Nun read it on the fifteenth [of Adar]. Villages and large cities read it on the fourteenth, but villages read in advance on the day of assembly.",
            "How does it work?  If the fourteenth of the month fell on a Monday, villages and large cities read on that day, and those surrounded by a wall - on the next day.  If it fell on a Tuesday or a Wednesday - villages [read] in advance on the day of assembly, and large cities read on that day, and those surrounded by a wall - on the next day.  If it fell on a Thursday, villages and large cities read on that day, and those surrounded by a wall - on the next day. If it fell on the day before Shabbat - villages [read] in advance on the day of assembly, and large cities and cities surrounded by a wall read on that day.  If it fell on Shabbat, villages and large cities read in advance on the day of assembly, and those surrounded by a wall - on the next day.  If it fell after Shabbat, villages [read] in advance on the assembly day, and large cities read on that day, and cities surrounded by a wall - on the next day.",
            "What kind of city is considered large? Any in which there are ten idle men. Any less than that, it is considered a village. Concerning these [laws, the rabbis] said: \"We may do so in advance but not delay.\" But the time of [delivery of] wood for the priests, and [the fast of] the 9th of Av, and the festival offering, and <i>hakhel</i> [the national gathering at the Temple on Sukkot after the Sabbatical year to hear the king read the Torah] may be delayed but not done in advance. And even though they said [in respect to the reading of the Megillah] that it may be done in advance, it is still permitted [before the fourteenth of Adar, even when the Megillah is read,] to eulogize, to fast, and to give gifts to the poor. Rabbi Yehudah said: In what situation [are these alternative dates valid]? In places where they in fact assemble on Monday and Thursday. But in a place where they do not assemble, neither on Monday nor on Thursday, they can only read it at its ordained time.",
            "If the <i>Megillah</i> was read in first Adar, and the year was [subsequently] intercalated, we read it in second Adar. There is no difference between the first Adar and the second Adar except the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> and alms to the poor.",
            "There is no difference between a festival day and Shabbat except <i>okhel nefesh</i> (the law allowing one to do certain types of food preparation on festivals). There is no difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur except that the willful violation of [Shabbat] is [punishable] by man, and the willful violation of [Yom Kippur] is [punishable] by <i>karet</i> [Divinely imposed punishment consisting in severance from Heaven and/or the Jewish people].",
            "There is no difference between one who disavows any benefit from his fellow and one who disavows [accepting] any food from him except setting foot [in his house] and [borrowing] vessels that are not used for <i>okhel nefesh</i>. There is no difference between vow-offerings and voluntary offerings except that one is obligated to fulfill his vow-offerings [regardless of whether the original animal can be brought], and one is not obligated to fulfill voluntary offerings [if the original animal cannot be brought].",
            "There is no difference between a <i>zav</i> [a male who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, which render him impure] who has seen two sightings and one who has seen three except an offering. There is no difference between a [possible] <i>metzorah</i> [one rendered severely impure from an unsightly skin disease. Upon recovery and purification, he must bring offerings] who has been sequestered [in order to ascertain his status] and one who has been definitively declared a <i>metzorah</i> except rent clothes and unkempt hair. There is no difference between one who was declared pure after being sequestered [in order to ascertain his status] and one who was declared pure after being definitively declared [a <i>metzorah</i>] except shaving and [the offering of] birds.",
            "There is no difference between <i>sefarim</i> [books of the Tanach written in holiness, on parchment, and used for personal or public study, or for reading aloud in public. Sometimes the intent is specifically Torah scrolls] and tefillin and <i>mezuzot</i> except that <i>sefarim</i> may be written in any language, while tefillin and <i>mezuzot</i> may only be written in <i>ashurit</i> [in the Hebrew language using a particular set of glyphs]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, \"Even concerning <i>sefarim</i>, they only permitted them to be written in Greek.\""

            "Any one who reads the Megillah in an irregular manner, does not acquit himself of his obligation; nor in case he reads it by heart, or translated in any language he does not understand; but it is lawful to read it to those who understand foreign languages, in that foreign language. One who speaks a foreign language, who has it read to him in Hebrew, will be released from his obligation.",
            "Should any person read it so as to make long pauses between the parts, and slumber meanwhile, he will be released from his obligation. If any one should read the Megillah whilst writing, expounding, or correcting it, with intention of thereby becoming released from his obligation, he will have fulfilled it, but not if he had no such intention. If the Megillah was written with paint, ruddle, gum, vitriol black, on papyrus, or on rough vellum, the obligation is not properly fulfilled; but it must be written in Hebrew characters, on good parchment, and with ink.",
            "If an inhabitant of an [open] town had gone to an [anciently] walled town, or one of [an anciently] walled town had gone to an [open] town; if he intend to return [when the Megillah is read] to his place, he shall read it at the same time they read it in his place; if not, he shall read it with the inhabitants of the place in which he then is. From when is it necessary to have commenced the reading of the Megillah, so as to have duly fulfilled the obligation? R. Meir says, \"It is obligatory to read the whole thing.\" Rabbi Yehudah says, \"It suffices if he commenced from the verse <i> Ish Yehudi</i>‎ (Esther 2:5).\" Rabbi Yose says, \"[Even if] from ‏the verse <i> Achar Hedevarim Haeleh</i> (Esther 3:1).\"",
            "All are qualified to read the Megillah, with the exception of a deaf-mute, a <i>shoteh</i>, or a minor; but Rabbi Yehudah allows it to be said by a minor. The following religious acts may not be done before sun-rise on the day on which they are obligatory, viz.:—To read the Megillah, to circumcise, to bathe [on the seventh day of the purification of an unclean or defiled person], to sprinkle [the unclean as a purification]; nor may a woman [who had experienced her menses beyond the usual time, and who was to] wait a day [before she might bathe] do so before the sun-rise of that day. But if any of these acts have been done at any period after day-break, they are valid.",
            "The following religious acts may be done during the whole of the day [on which they are obligatory], viz.:—The reading of the Megillah; of the Hallel; the sounding of the cornet; the use of the loolab, or palm-branch; the prayer at the additional offering; the additional offering; the confession of sin on sacrificing the bulls; the confession to be made on bringing the [second] tithe; the confession of sin by the high priest on the day of atonement; the imposition of hands [on a sacrifice]; the slaughtering of a sacrifice; the waving of the offering; the bringing it to the altar; the taking of the handful of flour (Lev. 2:2); the burning with incense of the fat of a sacrifice on the altar; the pinching or wringing off the head of fowls brought as sacrifices (Lev. 1:15); the receiving of the blood of a sacrifice; the sprinkling thereof on the altar; the giving the bitter waters to drink to a woman suspected of adultery; the striking off of the heifer's neck (Deut. 21:4); and the purification of a leprous person.",
            "The following acts may be done during the whole of the night: the cutting of the sheaves for the \"omer,\" and the burning with incense of the fat and members of a burnt-offering on the altar (Lev. 6:9). This is the rule:—Whatever is commanded to be done by day, may legally be done during the whole of the day; and whatever is commanded to be done by night, it is lawful to do during the whole of the night."

            "Inhabitants of a town who have sold the open [or marketplace] of the town, may buy for that money a synagogue. The proceeds of the sale of a synagogue, they may apply to the purchase of an ark [in which Torah scrolls are stored]; for the proceeds of the sale of such an ark, cloaks or wrappers [for Torah scrolls] may be purchased; for the proceeds of the sale of such wrappers, <i>sefarim</i> [books of the Tanach written in holiness, on parchment, and used for personal or public study, or for reading aloud in public. Sometimes the intent is specifically Torah scrolls] may be purchased; for the proceeds of the sale of <i>sefarim</i>, a Torah [scroll] may be purchased; but if they had sold a Torah [scroll], it will not be lawful to apply the proceeds to the purchase of [other] <i>sefarim</i>, nor wrappers for the proceeds of <i>sefarim</i>, nor an ark for the proceeds of wrappers, nor a synagogue with the proceeds of an ark, nor an open [or market] place with the money obtained by the sale of a synagogue, and even so in respect to any surplus fund. According to Rabbi Yehudah, it is unlawful to sell sacred public property to private individuals, because its sanctity becomes thereby lowered: but the sages replied, \"If so, it would be also prohibited for a large town to sell sacred things to a smaller one.\"",
            "A synagogue may, according to Rabbi Meir, only be sold on condition that it may at any time be repurchased by the original owners; but the sages permit it to be sold permanently, only it may not be sold to be applied to the following occupations: namely, as a bathing-house, as a tanning place [or pit], as a diving-bath, and as a laundry. Rabbi Yehudah says, \"It may be sold on the condition that it be made an open court, and then the purchaser is at liberty to turn it to what purpose he pleases.\"",
            "Rabbi Yehudah teaches also, that no funeral orations may be delivered in a synagogue which had become ruinous, nor may it be used as a rope-walk, nor to spread nets therein [to dry], nor to spread fruit on its roof, nor to use it as a short cut, as it is said (Lev. 26:31), \"I will bring your sanctuaries into desolation,\" that is, they remain sanctuaries even in their desolation. If grass spring up therein, it may not be pulled up, that the view may contribute to the affliction [of the beholder].",

On the second, the section ‏of <i>Zachor</i> (Deut. 25:17), is to be read; on the third, that of the red heifer, ‏<i> Parah</i> (Num. 19); on the fourth, that of ‏<i>Hachodesh</i>  (Exod. 12:1); on the fifth, they return again to the regular order. The regular order [of parashot] is also interrupted on Rosh Chodesh, on Chanukah, on Purim, on fasts, and on Yom Kippur.",

The curses must be read without interruption, namely, one person must read the whole [chapter]. On Mondays and Thursdays, and on the Sabbath afternoon, they shall read the section of the law in its regular order, but these readings are not available to reduce the regular number: for it is said, Lev.23:44, \"Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed festivals of the Lord,\" whence it is inferred, that each section must be read on the appointed festival to which it refers."

            "The Megillah may be read either sitting or standing, by one person only, or by two persons at the same time, they alike fulfill their obligation. In places where it is usual to say a blessing [after reading it], it is obligatory to say it, but not where it is not customary. Three men are called [to read in the Holy Law] on Mondays and Thursdays; and in the afternoon of the Sabbath, neither more nor less than that number may be called, nor shall any section from the Prophets then be read. He who commences the reading of the Holy Law, shall say the [first] blessing before reading it, and he who concludes the reading, shall say the last blessing to be said after reading it.",

The first of these [men] shall say the [first] blessing before reading, and the last, who concludes the reading, shall say the last blessing after reading. This is the rule: on all days when an additional offering is prescribed, and which are not festivals, four men are to be called; five on festivals; six on the day of atonement; and seven on the Sabbath; this number may not be diminished, but it may be increased, and a section from the Prophets must be read on those days.

A person who makes the tephilin round, endangers himself, and has not properly observed the commandment; a person who places them [low down] on his forehead, or on the palm of his hand, acts in a heretical manner: if he cover them with gold, or placed it on the outside of his sleeve, he imitates the opponents of tradition.",
