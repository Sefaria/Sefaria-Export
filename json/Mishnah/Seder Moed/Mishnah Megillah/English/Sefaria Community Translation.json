            "The Megila [of Esther] is read on the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, the fourteenth and the fifteenth [of Adar], not less and not more. Cities with walls from the time of Joshua son of Nun read [the Megila] on the fifteenth [of Adar]. Villages and large cities read [the Megila] on the fourteenth, but villages move reading to the day of assembly.", 
            "What's the case?  If the 14th of the month is Monday - villages and large cities read on that day, and cities surrounded by a wall on the next day.  If [the 14th of the month] is Tuesday or Wednesday - villages [read] earlier, on the gathering day, and    large cities read on that day, and cities surrounded by a wall [read] on the next day.  If [the 14th of the month] is on Thursday - villages and large cities read on that day, and cities surrounded by a wall [read] on the next day. If [the 14th of the month] is on the day before Shabbat - villages [read] earlier, on the gathering day, and large cities and cities surrounded by a wall read on that day.  If [the 14th of the month] is on Shabbat - villages and large cities read earlier, on the gathering day, and those surrounded by a wall [read] on the next day.  If [the 14th of the month] is after Shabbat (Sunday) - villages [read] earlier, on the gathering day, and large cities read on that day, and cities surrounded by a wall [read] on the next day."
