            "Shammai says: For all women, their hour [of discovering menstrual blood] suffices [to reckon the period of their impurity from that moment]. Hillel says: [the period of impurity is reckoned retroactively] from [the previous] examination to [the latest] examination, even for many days [i.e. she is assumed to have been impure the entire time]. The Sages say: [the law is] not according to this one nor according to that one, but rather [the period of impurity is reckoned] from that time to that time [on the previous day, i.e. twenty-four hours earlier, when this] lessens [the period] from examination to examination; and [it is reckoned] from [the previous] examination to [the latest] examination [when this] lessens [the period] from that time to that time [on the previous day, twenty-four hours earlier]. For any woman who has a regular cycle, her hour [of discovering menstrual blood] suffices [to reckon the period of her impurity from that moment]. And if a woman uses checking-cloths [literally: witnesses, to clean herself before and after intercourse], this is thereby like an examination, and it lessens [the period of impurity] from [being measured from] that time to that time [i.e. twenty-four hours earlier], or from [the previous] examination to [the latest] examination.",
            "How is it that her hour [of discovering menstrual blood] suffices [to reckon her impurity from that moment]? If she was sitting on a bed and was occupied with handling pure things [i.e. foods or vessels], and she left and [then] saw [blood], she is impure, and they are all pure [since her impurity is reckoned only from that moment]. Even though they said [regarding a woman who does not have a regular period]: she renders items impure from that time to that time [i.e. from twenty-fours hours earlier, retroactively], she only counts [her days of menstrual impurity] from the hour she saw [blood].",
            "Rabbi Eliezer says: There are four [types of] women whose hour [of discovering blood] suffices [to reckon their impurity from that moment]: a virgin, a pregnant woman, a nursing woman, and an elderly woman. Rabbi Yehoshua said: I only heard [this law] regarding a virgin, but the law is in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer. ",
            "Who [is considered] a virgin [such that her hour suffices]? Any who has never seen [menstrual] blood all her days, even if she is married. A pregnant woman? [She is considered to be pregnant] once her fetus becomes known [i.e. at the end of her first trimester]. A nursing woman? [She is considered to be nursing] until she weans her child [i.e. for twenty-four months]. If she gave her child to a nursemaid, or weaned him, or if he died [within twenty-four months], Rabbi Meir says: she is rendered impure [retroactively] from that time to that time [on the previous day, i.e. twenty-four hours earlier]. And the Sages say: her hour [of discovering blood] suffices [to render her impure only from that moment].",
            "Who is [considered] an elderly woman? Anyone who has gone through three seasons [without menstruating], approaching her old age. Rabbi Eliezer says: any woman [i.e. young or old] who has gone through three seasons [without menstruating], her hour [of discovering blood] suffices [to reckon her impurity from that moment]. Rabbi Yose says: a pregnant or nursing woman who has gone through three seasons [without menstruating], their hour suffices [to render them impure only from the moment of discovering blood]. ",
            "And concerning what did they say that her hour suffices?  [They said this] regarding the first observation [of blood], but by the second [observation] she is impure [retroactively] from that time to that time [twenty-four hours earlier]. And if she saw her first observation as a result of compulsion [i.e. if it was caused unnaturally, as by an accident], even for the second  observation her hour suffices [to reckon her impurity from that moment]. ",
            "Even though they said that her hour suffices, she should be examining [herself], except for a <i>niddah</i> [a female who has menstrual discharges which render her impure], or one who is sitting over pure blood [i.e. following a period of impurity after giving birth, there is a period of days during which a woman remains pure even if she sees blood].  And she should have intercourse using checking-cloths [literally: witnesses, before and after intercourse], except for one who is sitting over pure blood, or a virgin whose blood is pure. And she should examine twice [daily], in the morning and at twilight, and when she going to have relations with her husband [literally: her house]. More [restricted] than this are priestly women [for they should examine themselves] at the hour that they eat from <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a priest which becomes sanctified upon separation, and can only be consumed by priests or their household, and which should not be rendered impure]. Rabbi Yehuda says: [they should examine themselves] also when they are leaving from having eaten <i>terumah</i>."

            "Every hand that examines frequently, regarding women, this is praiseworthy; and regarding men, it should be cut off. Regarding a deaf woman, a <i>shotah</i>, a blind woman, or a woman whose cognition has been impaired, if they have able-minded women [to care for them], they prepare them [i.e. help them check themselves and immerse for purity], and they may then eat <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to the priests which becomes designated as such upon separation, and can only be consumed by priests or their household, and which one is forbidden to render impure]. It is the way of the daughters of Israel to have intercourse using two checking-cloths [literally: witnesses], one for him, and one for her. The modest ones prepare a third, to prepare herself [literally: the house, before intercourse].  ",
            "If [blood was] found on his [checking-cloth], they [the woman and her husband] are both impure, and are liable to bring a sacrifice. If it is found on hers immediately [after intercourse], they are impure, and are liable to bring a sacrifice. If it is found on hers after some time, they are impure as a matter of uncertainty, and they are exempt from bringing a sacrifice. ",
            "What is [considered to be] after some time? As long as it takes for her to descend from the bed and rinse her [nether] face. And afterwards [if she found blood], she [retroactively] renders impurity from that time to that time [twenty-four hours earlier], but she does not render impure the man who had intercourse with her. Rabbi Akiva says: she also renders impure the man who had intercourse with her. And the Sages agree with Rabbi Akiva regarding one who sees a [blood] stain, that she renders impure the man who has intercourse with her [after she saw the stain]. ",
            "All women are presumed to be pure for their husbands [i.e. husbands may presume that their wives are pure]. Those who return from a journey, their wives are presumed to be pure for them. Beit Shammai says: she requires two checking-cloths [literally: witnesses] for each and every time she has intercourse [i.e. so she can check them the next day], or she must have relations by the light of a candle [i.e. she must use a checking-cloth after intercourse and examine it by candlelight then]. Beit Hillel says: two checking-cloths suffice for her for the whole night. ",
            "The Sages analogized women through a parable: a chamber, a corridor, and an upper chamber. The blood of the chamber is impure. If [blood is] found in the corridor, its uncertainty is impure [i.e. there is an uncertainty regarding its origin, and it is thereby impure], because it is presumed to have come from the source [i.e. from the chamber]. ",
            "Five kinds [colors] of blood in a woman are impure: the red, and the black, and like the brightness of a crocus, and like earthy waters, and like diluted wine. Beit Shammai say: also like fenugreek water, and like the waters of roasted meat. And Beit Hillel consider these [last two] pure. Regarding that which is yellow [literally: green], Akavia ben Mahalalel considers it impure, and the Sages consider it pure. Rabbi Meir said: even if it does not render impurity as a [blood] stain, it [nonetheless] renders impurity as a liquid.   Rabbi Yose says: neither thus, nor thus.    ",
            "What is [considered] red? Like the blood of a wound. Black? Like ink-sediment; [black which is] deeper than this is impure, paler than this is pure. And [what is considered] like the brightness of a crocus? Like the clearest [shaded petal] in it. And like earthy waters? [Like the reddish earth] from the Bet Kerem valley, with waters floating over it. And [what is considered] like diluted wine? Two parts water, and one [part] wine, from wine of Sharon."

            "If she miscarries something like a membrane, like a hair, like dust, like red flies, she should put it in water, [and] if it dissolves she is impure; and if not, she is pure. If she miscarries something like fish, [like] locusts, [like] <i>shekatsim u'remasim</i> [small animals, such as reptiles, insect, or rodents, which move by scurrying, creeping, slithering, etc.], if they had blood with them, she is impure; and if not, she is pure. If she miscarries something like a [domesticated] animal, a beast, or a fowl, whether pure or impure ones [i.e. kosher or not kosher], if it is male, she should sit for [the number of postpartum days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male; and if it is female, she should sit for [the number of postpartum days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a female. And if [its sex is] unknown, she should sit for [the number of days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female [i.e. she should be stringent in both directions, with a longer period of initial impurity, and a shorter period of subsequent purity], according to Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say: anything that does not have a human shape is not [considered to be] a fetus [with regard to the purity status of one who gives birth].  ",
            "If she miscarries a sac full of water, full of blood, or full of strands [of flesh], she need not be suspicious that it was a fetus. But if its was assembled [into a human form], she should sit for [the number of postpartum days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. ",
            "If she miscarries a sandal [i.e. a piece of flesh without a face, similar in shape to a sandal] or a placenta, she should sit for [the number of days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. If a placenta is in a house, the house is impure [as from the impruty of a corpse]; not because a placenta is a fetus, but because there can be no placenta without a fetus. Rabbi Shimon says: the fetus [that was in the placenta] dissolved [into the blood and was nullified] before it came out [and therefore the house is not impure].",
            "If she miscarries a <i>tumtum</i> [person (or animal) with recessed sexual organs whose gender is therefore impossible to determine, presently, by external examination. It is halachically uncertain whether such is male or female] [fetus], or an <i>androginos</i> [person (or animal) with both male and female sexual organs. It is halachically uncertain whether such is male, female or, perhaps, has a uniquely defined halachic gender] [fetus], she should sit for [the number of days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. If [she miscarries] a <i>tumtum</i> [fetus] and a male [fetus, at once], or an <i>androginos</i>and a male, she should sit for [the required number of days for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. If [she miscarries] a <i>tumtum</i> [fetus] and a female [fetus, at once], or an <i>androginos</i>and a female, she should sit only for [the required number of days for one who gives birth to] a female. If it emerged in pieces or backwards, once the majority of it has emerged it is regarded as having been born. If it came out normally, [it is not considered born] until the majority of its head has emerged. And what is [considered to be] the majority of its head? Once its forehead emerges. ",
            "If she miscarries, and it is unknown what it is, she should sit for [the number of days of impurity and purity required for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female. If it is unknown whether it was a fetus or not, she should sit for [the required number of days for one who gives birth to] a male and for [one who gives birth to] a female, and for [being] a <i>niddah</i> [a female who has menstrual discharges which render her impure; i.e. she should be stringent in all directions].   ",
            "If she miscarries on the fortieth day [since her prior immersion], she need not be concerned that it was a fetus. If [she miscarries] on the forty-first day, she should sit [for the required number of days] for a male and for a female, and for [being] a <i>niddah</i>. Rabbi Yishmael says: on the forty-first day she should sit for [the required number of days for one who gives birth to] a male and for [being] a <i>niddah</i>. On the eighty-first day she should sit for a male and for a female and for [being] a <i>niddah</i>, because [the formation of] a male is completed in forty-one [days], and a female in eighty-one.

But one is not liable for entering the Temple [while impure] on account of [having been rendered impure or carrying something which has been rendered impure by] them, nor is <i>terumah</i>  [a portion of a crop given to the priests which can only be consumed by priests or their household, and which one is forbidden to render impure or consume while impure] burned on their account [if rendered impure by them], because their impurity is uncertain.",

Regarding the blood of a woman who gave birth and did not immerse, Beit Shammai say: it is like her spit or her urine. And Beit Hillel say: it renders impurity when damp or dry.

Rabbi Yehoshua says: [she must have ceased having pains for] a night and a day, like the night of Shabbat its day [i.e. for a full night and subsequent day, and not for any twenty-four hour period]. This applies to one who ceased [for that time] from her pain, but not [necessarily] from bleeding.",

They said to Rabbi Eliezer, \"Just as in a case where one is stringent regarding blood when pain has ceased [i.e. that such blood renders the woman who gives birth impure] there is a leniency regarding blood during difficult labor [i.e. which does not render her impure], in a case where one is lenient regarding blood when pain has ceased [i.e. during the days of postpartum purity, which does not render her impure], does it not follow logically that we should be lenient regarding blood during difficult labor [that it, too, should not render her impure]?!\" He said to them, \"It is sufficient for the case inferred to be treated in the same manner as the one from which it is inferred! Regarding what were they lenient with her? Regarding the impurity of <i>zivah</i>.

If the time of her regular period arrived and she did not examine herself, she is thereby impure.   Rabbi Meir says: if she was in a hiding place when the time of her regular period arrived and she did not examine herself, she is thereby pure, because fear banishes blood.
