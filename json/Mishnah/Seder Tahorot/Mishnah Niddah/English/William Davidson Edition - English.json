            "Shammai <b>says:</b> For <b>all women</b> who do not have a fixed menstrual cycle, <b>their time is sufficient.</b> Women who discern that menstrual blood emerged do not need to be concerned that perhaps the flow of blood began before they noticed it. Rather, they assume their ritual impurity status begins at that moment, in terms of rendering impure <i>teruma</i> and ritually pure items with which they come in contact. <b>Hillel says: From examination [<i>mipekida</i>] to examination,</b> i.e., she assumes ritual impurity status retroactive to the last time she examined herself and determined that she was ritually pure, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if her examination took place <b>several days</b> earlier. Any ritually pure item with which she came in contact in the interim becomes ritually impure. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>neither in accordance with the statement of this</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>nor in accordance with the statement of that</b> <i>tanna</i>; <b>rather,</b> the principle is: A twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination.</b> In other words, if her final self-examination took place more than twenty-four hours earlier, she need only concern herself with ritual impurity for the twenty-four-hour period prior to discerning the blood. <b>And from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> In other words, if she examined herself in the course of the previous day and discovered no blood, she was certainly ritually pure prior to the examination. For <b>any woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle [<i>veset</i>],</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that time that she transmits ritual impurity. <b>And</b> with regard to a woman <b>who engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths [<i>be’edim</i>]</b> before and after intercourse, with which she ascertains whether her menstrual flow began, the halakhic status of such an action <b>is like that of an examination, and</b> therefore <b>it reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, and</b> reduces the time <b>from examination to examination.</b>",
            "<b>Her time is sufficient, how so?</b> If the woman <b>was sitting in the bed and engaged in</b> handling <b>ritually pure items, and she left</b> the bed <b>and saw</b> blood, <b>she is ritually impure and</b> those items <b>are ritually pure.</b> <b>Although</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> that a woman without a fixed menstrual cycle <b>transmits ritual impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> a woman with a fixed cycle <b>counts</b> her menstrual days <b>only from the moment that she saw</b> blood.",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Unlike the women with regard to whom it was taught that they transmit impurity retroactively, there are <b>four women</b> who discern menstrual blood and <b>their time is sufficient,</b> i.e., they transmit impurity only from the moment that they saw the blood: <b>A virgin, a pregnant woman, a nursing woman, and an elderly woman. Rabbi Yehoshua says: I heard</b> this <i>halakha</i> from my teachers <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a virgin,</b> <b>but</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>",
            "<b>Who is</b> the woman characterized as <b>a virgin</b> in this context? It is <b>any</b> woman <b>who has not seen</b> the flow of menstrual <b>blood in all her days, even if she was married</b> and has experienced bleeding as a result of intercourse consummating her marriage. The time of <b>a pregnant woman</b> is <b>from</b> the point in her pregnancy when the existence of <b>her fetus is known</b> to all who see her. The time of <b>a nursing woman</b> is <b>until she weans her child</b> from nursing. If she stopped nursing, e.g., <b>she gave her child to a wet nurse, weaned him</b> from nursing, <b>or</b> her child <b>died,</b> and she saw menstrual blood, <b>Rabbi Meir says: She transmits impurity for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> or from her most recent examination. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Even in those cases, <b>her time is sufficient.</b>",
            "<b>Who is</b> the woman characterized as <b>an elderly woman</b> in this context? It is <b>any</b> woman for <b>whom three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles</b> of thirty days <b>passed</b> during which she saw no menstrual blood, at a stage of her life <b>close to her old age. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> In the case of <b>any woman</b> for <b>whom three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles passed</b> during which she saw no menstrual blood, if she then experiences bleeding, <b>her time is sufficient. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>a pregnant woman and a nursing woman</b> for <b>whom three</b> typical menstrual <b>cycles passed</b> during which they saw no menstrual blood, if they then saw blood, <b>their time is sufficient.</b>",
            "<b>And</b> in the above cases, <b>with regard to what did</b> the <i>tanna</i> say <b>her time is sufficient?</b> It is <b>with regard to the first sighting</b> of blood, <b>but with regard to the second sighting,</b> her status is like that of any other woman, and <b>she transmits impurity for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> or from her most recent examination. <b>And if she saw the first</b> sighting as a result of <b>unnatural circumstances, even</b> with regard to <b>the second</b> sighting, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>her time is sufficient.</b>",
            "<b>Although</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> that for a woman with a fixed menstrual cycle <b>her time is sufficient</b> and she does not transmit impurity retroactively, <b>she is required to examine herself</b> each day to ensure that she is ritually pure and will not impurify pure items that she is handling. All women must examine themselves each day <b>except for a menstruating woman,</b> whose impure status is known, <b>and</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity,</b> whose ritually pure status is known even if she experiences bleeding. <b>And</b> even a woman with a fixed menstrual cycle <b>engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths</b> to ascertain whether her menstrual flow began, <b>except for</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity, and a virgin whose blood is ritually pure</b> for four days after engaging in intercourse for the first time. <b>And she is required to examine</b> herself <b>twice</b> each day: In the <b>morning,</b> to ascertain if she menstruated during the night, <b>and</b> at <b>twilight,</b> to ascertain if she menstruated during the day. <b>And</b> she is also required to examine herself <b>at a time that she is about to engage in intercourse with her husband.</b> The obligation of <b>women of priestly</b> families is <b>greater than</b> that of other women, as they are also required to examine themselves <b>when they</b> seek to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even when they conclude partaking of <i>teruma</i></b> they are required to examine themselves, in order to ascertain whether they experienced bleeding while partaking of <i>teruma</i>."

            "With regard to <b>any hand that is diligent to examine</b> bodily emissions to ascertain ritual impurity, <b>among women</b> such a hand <b>is praiseworthy. But among men</b> such a hand <b>should be severed,</b> as this action is apt to lead to a seminal emission for naught. In the case of a woman <b>who is deaf [<i>haḥereshet</i>], or an imbecile, or blind, or who went insane,</b> and is therefore unable to examine herself reliably, <b>if</b> such women <b>have competent</b> friends, those friends <b>prepare them</b> by examining them and immersing them in a ritual bath. <b>And</b> on that basis the incompetent women <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i></b> after the sun sets. It is <b>the custom of Jewish women</b> that <b>they engage in intercourse</b> with their husbands <b>while</b> using <b>two examination cloths, one for</b> the husband, to see if there is any of the wife’s blood on him after intercourse, <b>and one for her,</b> to ascertain after intercourse whether her menstrual flow has begun. <b>And the modest</b> women <b>prepare a third</b> examination cloth, <b>to</b> examine themselves and <b>prepare</b> the pubic <b>area</b> for intercourse.",
            "If blood <b>was found on his</b> cloth, the woman and her husband are both <b>ritually impure</b> for seven days, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a menstruating woman and of one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman, <b>and are</b> each <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering</b> for unwittingly performing an action punishable with excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].

            "<b>What is</b> considered as being: <b>After time</b> passed?

            "<b>All women have the presumptive status of purity for their husbands,</b> and therefore one is not required to ascertain whether his wife is ritually pure before engaging in intercourse with her. Even with regard to husbands <b>returning from a journey,</b> if their wives were ritually pure when they left, <b>their wives have the presumptive status of purity for them.</b> <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> A woman is <b>required</b> to examine herself with <b>two cloths,</b> once before and once after <b>each and every</b> act of <b>intercourse</b> in which she engages throughout the night, and she must inspect them for blood the following morning, <b>or</b> she must <b>engage in intercourse by the light of a lamp</b> and inspect the cloths before and after each act of intercourse. <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> She is not required to examine herself between each act of intercourse. Rather, it is <b>sufficient</b> for her to examine herself <b>with two cloths throughout the night,</b> once before the first act of intercourse and once after the final act of intercourse.",
            "A woman’s reproductive organs are composed of different parts, and the halakhic status of blood that emerges from one part differs from the halakhic status of blood that emerges from another part. <b>The Sages stated a parable with regard to</b> the structure of the sexual organs of <b>a woman,</b> based on the structure of a house: <b>The</b> inner <b>room</b> represents the uterus, <b>and the corridor [<i>perozdor</i>]</b> leading to the inner room represents the vaginal canal, <b>and the upper story</b> represents the bladder. <b>Blood</b> from <b>the</b> inner <b>room is ritually impure.

Despite <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty,</b> it is deemed definitely <b>impure, due to</b> the fact <b>that its presumptive status</b> is of blood that came <b>from the source,</b> i.e., the uterus, and not from the bladder.",
            "There are <b>five</b> distinct colors of <b>ritually impure blood in a woman: Red, and black, and like the bright</b> color of the <b>crocus [<i>karkom</i>]</b> flower, <b>and like water</b> that inundates red <b>earth, and like diluted</b> wine. <b>Beit Shammai say: Even</b> blood <b>like the water</b> in which <b>a fenugreek</b> plant is soaked, <b>and like the liquid</b> that drips from <b>roast meat,</b> are ritually impure, <b>and Beit Hillel deem</b> blood of those colors <b>ritually pure.</b> With regard to blood that is <b>green, Akavya ben Mahalalel deems</b> it <b>impure and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>pure.</b> <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> Even <b>if</b> the green blood <b>does not transmit impurity due to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a blood <b>stain</b> or the blood of a menstruating woman, it is blood in that <b>it renders</b> food susceptible to <b>ritual impurity due to</b> its status as one of the seven <b>liquids</b> that render food susceptible to impurity. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Neither</b> in <b>this</b> sense, as the blood of a menstruating woman according to Akavya ben Mahalalel, <b>nor</b> in <b>that</b> sense, as a liquid that renders food susceptible to impurity according to Rabbi Meir, is green blood considered blood.",
            "The mishna asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>red</b> color that is impure? It is as red <b>as the blood</b> that flows from <b>a wound.</b> What is the <b>black</b> color that is impure?

The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: And what,</b> if <b>in an instance where</b> the verse <b>was stringent with regard to blood</b> emitted while <b>resting,</b> namely if a pregnant woman emits blood after her days of purity without any labor pains she is rendered impure, the verse <b>was lenient with regard to blood</b> that accompanies <b>the</b> labor <b>pains;</b> then in <b>an instance where</b> the verse <b>was lenient with regard to blood</b> emitted while <b>resting,</b> i.e., during a woman’s days of purity, <b>is it not right that we will be lenient with regard to blood</b> that accompanies <b>the</b> labor <b>pains?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them:</b> When deriving a <i>halakha</i> by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, there is a principle that <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> In other words, the status of blood emitted due to labor pains during her days of purity should not be more lenient than that of blood emitted due to labor pains after her days of purity. Rabbi Eliezer elaborates: <b>Concerning what</b> type of impurity <b>was</b> the verse <b>lenient with regard to</b> a woman who experiences an emission of blood due to labor pains? <b>Concerning the impurity of <i>ziva</i>. But she</b> may still be rendered <b>ritually impure</b> with <b>the impurity of a menstruating woman.</b> So too, if a woman experiences emissions of blood due to labor pains during her days of purity, she is rendered a menstruating woman.",
            "For <b>all</b> the <b>eleven days</b> of <i>ziva</i> that follow the seven days of menstruation, a woman <b>has the presumptive status of ritual purity,</b> as it is unusual for her to experience bleeding on these days. If a woman <b>sat and did not examine</b> herself every morning and evening to determine whether she emitted blood and is impure, it makes no difference whether she failed to examine herself <b>unwittingly</b> or due to <b>circumstances beyond her control,</b> or even if she acted <b>intentionally and did not examine</b> herself; she remains <b>ritually pure.</b> She is rendered impure only if she examined herself and was found to have emitted blood. By contrast, if <b>the time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle arrived,</b> when she is required to examine herself, <b>and she did not examine</b> herself, <b>that</b> woman <b>is ritually impure,</b> as it is typical for a woman to discharge blood at that time. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> If a woman <b>was in hiding</b> from danger, <b>and the time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle arrived and she did not examine</b> herself on that day, <b>that</b> woman <b>is pure, because fear drives away blood.</b> There is therefore no concern that she might have emitted blood. <b>But</b> with regard to the seven clean <b>days of the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i>, and</b> with regard to a woman who <b>observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge during her days of <i>ziva</i>, if she fails to examine herself on those days, <b>these</b> women <b>have a presumptive status of ritual impurity,</b> as they already experienced a discharge."

            "<b>And</b> Beit Shammai <b>concede</b> to Beit Hillel that a woman observing the days of purity <b>partakes of</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce, as it is permitted for one who immersed that day to eat second-tithe produce. <b>And she separates</b> part of <b>her</b> dough as <b><i>ḥalla</i>, and she draws</b> the vessel with the part of the dough that she separated <b>near</b> the rest of the dough, <b>and she designates it</b> with the <b>name</b> of <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>And</b> Beit Shammai further concede to Beit Hillel <b>that if</b> a drop <b>from her saliva or from the blood of purity fell onto a loaf of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the loaf <b>is ritually pure,</b> as any liquid discharged from the body of one who immersed that day is ritually pure. There is another dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> with regard to a woman who completed her days of purity. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Her immersion at the end of the days of impurity does not render it permitted for her to enter the Temple or to partake of <i>teruma</i>; rather, <b>she requires immersion</b> even <b>at the conclusion</b> of the days of purity. <b>And Beit Hillel say: She does not require immersion at the conclusion</b> of the days of purity to render it permitted for her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, as the immersion at the end of the days of impurity is sufficient.",
            "There is a dispute with regard to a woman <b>who sees</b> blood on the <b>eleventh day,</b> which is the final day of the period fit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>. It is permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband after observing one clean day corresponding to the one day that she saw blood, but in this case, she failed to observe one clean day. Rather, <b>she immersed</b> in a ritual bath that <b>evening,</b> the eve of the twelfth day, <b>and</b> then <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Since she did not observe that corresponding clean day, she retains the status of a <i>zava</i>. Therefore both she, the <i>zava</i>, and her husband, who engaged in intercourse with a <i>zava</i>, <b>transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting,</b> to the extent that these transmit impurity to food and drink that came in contact with them, and in her case, to people as well. <b>And</b> each of them is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering for participating in intercourse involving a <i>zava</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Although they transmit impurity to items designated for lying or sitting, <b>they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering.</b> Since the twelfth day is unfit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>, and even if she were to experience bleeding on the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth days she would not become a greater <i>zava</i>, one who experiences bleeding on the eleventh does not need to observe a corresponding clean day. If the woman <b>immersed on the day following</b> the eleventh day <b>and she engaged in intercourse with</b> the man of <b>her house,</b> i.e., her husband, on that twelfth day <b>and then saw</b> blood, <b>Beit Shammai say: They transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> by rabbinic law, as the Sages issued a decree of impurity in the case when the second day is the twelfth day, due to a case when the second day is within the eleven days fit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>. <b>And they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering,</b> as she observed part of the twelfth day, and the bleeding she experienced after engaging in intercourse, which occurred during her period of menstruation, is not fit to be appended to the discharge of the <i>zava</i> on the eleventh day. <b>And Beit Hillel say: That</b> husband <b>is a glutton,</b> as he could not wait for the conclusion of the twelfth day before engaging in intercourse. Nevertheless, the Sages did not issue a decree of impurity. <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede</b> to Beit Shammai <b>in</b> a case where the woman <b>sees</b> blood <b>in the midst of the eleven-day</b> period, <b>and she immersed in the evening and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband without observing a corresponding clean day, <b>that they transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting. And</b> each of them is <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering</b> for participating in intercourse involving a <i>zava</i>. If she saw blood in the midst of the eleven days and observed part of a corresponding clean day and <b>immersed on the day following</b> the day that she saw blood <b>and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband, <b>that is wayward conduct,</b> as the possibility exists that she will experience bleeding after intercourse that will be appended to the bleeding of the previous day, rendering her a <i>zava</i> and disqualifying the immersion. <b>And</b> the status of ritually impure items with which <b>they came into contact and</b> the status of <b>their intercourse is contingent</b> upon whether she experiences bleeding on the day of her immersion, in which case the ritually pure items become impure and they are liable to bring a sin offering, or whether she does not experience bleeding that day, in which case the ritually pure items remain pure and the woman and man are exempt from bringing a sin offering."
