            "There are six levels of <i>mikvaot</i> [gatherings of water collected by natural means and immersed in for purification], each [subsequent] one higher than the other: [The first and lowest level is] water collected in shallow pools [in the ground]. If an impure person drank [from one], and a pure person drank [from it afterwards], he is impure. If an impure person drank, and someone filled up a pure vessel [from those waters afterwards], it [the vessel] is impure. If an impure person drank, and then loaf of <i>terumah</i> fell in, if one rinsed [the loaf], it is impure; and if one did not rinse it, it is pure.",

If one filled using an impure vessel, and then filled a pure vessel [with the waters from the first vessel], it is impure. If one filled an impure vessel, and then a loaf of <i>terumah</i> fell in [the pool], if one rinsed it, it is impure; and if one did not rinse it, it is pure.",
            "If impure waters fell [into such a pool], and a pure person drank [from it], he is impure. If impure waters fell in, and one filled a pure vessel [from it], it is impure. If impure waters fell in, and then loaf of <i>terumah</i> fell in, if one rinsed [the loaf], it is impure; and if one did not rinse it, it is pure. Rabbi Shimon says: whether or not once rinsed it, it is impure.",
            "If a dead person fell into them [the waters of such a pool], or if someone impure walked through them, if a pure person then drank [from them], he is [still] pure. As with the waters of shallow pools, [similarly] the waters of pits, the waters of trenches, the waters of caves, runoff waters that stopped [flowing from the mountains], and <i>mikvaot</i> that do not contain forty <i>se'ah</i> [a specific unit of volume], they are all pure during the rain. Once the rain stops, those [waters] close to cities and to the roads are presumed are [presumed to be] impure; and those far away are [presumed to be] pure, but only until [the rain damage of the nearby paths is repaired such that] most people walk by them.",
            "When does their purity [that of the waters of shallow pools during the rain] begin? Beit Shamai say: from when they [the rain waters] exceed [the amount of the pools' waters] and cause overflow. Beit Hillel say: [from when] they exceed, even if they do not cause overflow. Rabbi Shimon says: [from when] they cause overflow, even if they do not exceed. [Such waters are] valid to be used for <i>challah</i> [a portion of a batch of bread dough given to a priest which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by priests or their household], as well as for washing [literally: taking] one's hands with them.",
            "Above these [<i>mikvaot</i> described, and next in the hierarchy of <i>mikvaot</i>,] are runoff waters that have not stopped [flowing down from the mountains]. If an impure person drank [from them], and a pure person drank [afterwards], he is [still] pure. If an impure person drank, and someone filled up a pure vessel [from those waters afterwards], it is pure. If an impure person drank, and then a loaf of <i>terumah</i> fell in, even if one rinsed [the loaf], it is pure. If one filled an impure vessel [from the runoff waters], and a pure person drank [from it], he is pure. If one filled using an impure vessel, and then filled a pure vessel [from the first vessel], it is pure. If one filled an impure vessel, and then a loaf of <i>terumah</i> fell in [the runoff waters], even if one rinsed it, it is pure. If impure waters fell [into the runoff waters], and a pure person drank [from it], he is pure. If impure waters fell in, and one filled a pure vessel [from it], it is pure. If impure waters fell in, and then a loaf of <i>terumah</i> fell in, even if one rinsed it, it is pure.

Above these [<i>mikvaot</i>, and next in the hierarchy of <i>mikvaot</i>,] is a natural spring whose waters are few, and are exceeded by a greater quantity of drawn waters [which were added]. This [type of spring] is equivalent to a <i>mikveh</i> in that it purifies [only] when it is contained [in one place, standing still and not flowing], but [it is equivalent] to a spring in that one can immerse something in it [to purity it] when there is any amount of water [i.e. there is no minimum measure required].",
            "Above these [<i>mikvaot</i> described thus far, and next in the hierarchy of <i>mikvaot</i>,] are blighted waters, which purify even when flowing. Above these are living waters [i.e. pure, potable spring waters], that with them <i>zavim</i> [individuals who have certain types of atypical genital discharges, which render them impure] may be purified, and lepers may be sprinkled [as part of the process of purifying them], and they [these waters] are valid for use for the <i>chatat</i> ritual [i.e. to sanctify them with the ashes of a red heifer as part of the purification ritual]."

            "A <i>mikveh</i> which was measured and found to be lacking [the required forty <i>se'ah</i> of water], all purifications which were made upon it, whether in a private domain or in a public domain, are retroactively impure. To what [cases] does this apply? To a severe impurity [i.e something that was rendered impure by an Origin of impurity]. But with a light impurity, such as one who ate impure foods, or drank impure drinks, or one whose head and the majority of his body entered into drawn waters, or if three <i>log</i> [a specific measure of volume] of drawn water fell on one's head and the majority of one's body and one then went down to immerse;  [in such a cases,] if there is an uncertainty as to whether he immersed or not, or even if he immersed, if there is an uncertainty as to whether it contained forty <i>se'ah</i> in it or it did not, or if there were two <i>mikva'ot</i>, one with forty <i>se'ah</i> in it and one without, and he immersed in one of them but does not know in which one he immersed, [in such cases,] its uncertainty is pure [i.e. the cases are uncertain and resolved as pure]. Rabbi Yose considers it impure, as Rabbi Yose says: Everything which has a presumption of impurity remains forever in its invalid state, until it becomes known that it was purified. But its uncertainty [regarding its ability] to become impure or to render [something else] impure, is pure [i.e. such cases are uncertain and resolved as pure].",
            "Cases of uncertainty regarding drawn waters are considered pure by the Sages. [For example,] if it is uncertain whether they [the drawn waters] fell or did not fall [into a <i>mikveh</i>]; even if they did fall, if there is an uncertainty as to whether they [the waters of the <i>mikveh</i>] contained forty se'ah or did not; or if there were two <i>mikva'ot</i>, one mikveh containing forty <i>se'ah</i> and one not, and [drawn waters] fell into one of them and one does not know which it fell into, [in all these cases] its uncertainty is pure, because one has something upon which to hang [a presumption of purity]. If both [<i>mikvaot</i>] contained fewer than forty <i>se'ah</i>, and [drawn waters] fell into one of them and one does not know which it fell into, its uncertainty is impure [i.e. such a case is uncertain and resolved as impure], since one has nothing upon which to hang [a presumption of purity].

            "Rabbi Eliezer says: A <i>revi'it</i> [a specific measure of volume, a quarter of a <i>log</i>] of drawn waters render a <i>mikveh</i> invalid at the outset [i.e. if the waters were in the pit before the valid <i>mikveh</i> waters were added, as do as three <i>log</i> [of  drawn waters which were added] on the surface of the [valid] waters. And the Sages say: whether at the outset [before there were any waters in the pit] or at the end [after valid waters amounting to less than forty <i>se'ah</i> were added], the measure [for the minimum amount of drawn waters to invalidate a <i>mikveh</i>] is three <i>log</i>. ",
            "Regarding a <i>mikveh</i> that has three furrows containing drawn waters [along its sloping side, such that each furrow is above the next], with one <i>log</i> in each, if it is known that forty <i>se'ah</i> of valid water fell in before they reached the third furrow, it is valid; and if not, it is invalid. Rabbi Shimon considers it valid because it is like a <i>mikveh</i> next to a <i>mikveh</i>.",
            "One who removes the plaster [from the floor of <i>mikveh</i>] to the sides, and three <i>log</i> [of water] flowed from it [from the plaster], it is valid. If one removed [the plaster from the waters of the <i>mikveh</i>] and three <i>log</i> flowed out from it, it is invalid [since they are considered drawn waters]. And Rabbi Shimon considers it valid it because one did not intend to draw [the waters in such a case].",
            "One who places jugs on the rooftop to dry them, and they filled with water, Rabbi Eliezer says: if it is the rainy season, or if there is [some] water in the pit [even if it is not the rainy season], one may break the jugs [such that their waters flow into the <i>mikveh</i>]; and if not, one should not break them [so that their waters flow in, since such waters would render the <i>mikveh</i> invalid, like drawn waters]. Rabbi Yehoshua says: either way, one may break or tip [them], but one may not pour [them] out.",
            "The plasterer that forgot his pot in the pit and it filled with water, if the waters were floating in any amount over the top of it, one may break it [over the <i>mikveh</i> to add its waters, and it is not considered drawn water]; and if not, one may not break it [and add it, since such waters would be considered drawn, and thus invalid], according to Rabbi Eliezer. And Rabbi Yehoshua says: either way one may break it.",
            "One who arranges jugs in a pit and they filled with water, even if the pit absorbed all its waters [such that the only water left in it was the water in the jugs], one may thereby break them [letting their water enter the <i>mikveh</i>, and it will still be valid, and not considered drawn water].",
            "A <i>mikveh</i> containing water and plaster amount [together] to forty <i>se'ah</i>, Rabbi Eliezer says: one immerses [oneself or other items] in the water, and does not immerse in the plaster. Rabbi Yehoshua says: [one immerses both] in the water and in the plaster. In which plaster may one immerse? In plaster which water floats above. If the waters were on one side, Rabbi Yehoshua agrees that one immerses in the water and does not immerse in the plaster. Regarding which plaster was this said? Regarding plaster in which a reed descends into it by itself, according to Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: a place where [the plaster is thin enough that] a measuring stick will not stand [straight]. Abba Elazar ben Dolai says: a place where a [builder's] weight descends. Rabbi Eliezer says: that [plaster] which will descend into a barrel [with a narrow opening, when poured in]. Rabbi Shimon says: that which can enter the tube of a flask. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says: that which can be measured with a <i>log</i> [i.e. a vessel with a wider opening, used for measuring a <i>log</i>]."

            "Rabbi Yose says: Two <i>mikvaot</i> [gatherings of water collected by natural means and immersed in for purification] that do not [each] contain forty <i>se'ah</i> [a specific measure of volume], and which a <i>log</i> [a specific measure of volume] and a half [of drawn waters] fell into this one, and a <i>log</i> and half into that one, and they [the two <i>mikvaot</i>] became mixed together, they are valid, since they were never given a title of invalidity [i.e. independently, each was considered valid by the law]. But a <i>mikveh</i> which does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i>, into which fell three <i>log</i> [of drawn waters], and was then split into two, it is invalid, since it was given a title of invalidity [since three <i>log</i> of drawn waters invalidate a <i>mikveh</i> containing fewer than forty <i>se'ah</i> of valid waters]. And Rabbi Yehoshua considers it valid, for Rabbi Yehoshua would say: Any <i>mikveh</i> which does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i> [of valid waters], if three <i>log</i> [of drawn waters] fell into it, and it [then] became lacking even a <i>kortov</i> [A minute volume measure], it is valid [when enough valid water is added], since it is lacking [part of the] three <i>log</i>. And the Sages say: it is forever in its invalid state, until its fullness plus some more depart from it [i.e. it would need to become lacking the amount of water it contained before the drawn waters were added, plus a little more, in order to be considered valid].",
            "How so? If there is a pit in the courtyard, and three <i>log</i> [of drawn waters] fell into it, it is forever in its invalid state until its fullness, plus some more, depart from it, or until one erects [another <i>mikveh</i> containing] forty <i>se'ah</i> in the courtyard [and makes an opening to connect between them], and the upper [waters] will be purified by the lower. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah considers it invalid, except if one plugs up [all the sides of the pit containing the invalid waters, such that it is open only to the valid <i>mikveh</i>].",
            "If there is a pit full of drawn waters, and a channel [of rainwater] is entering into to and leaving from it, it is forever in its invalid state until it is calculated that there no longer remain [in the pit] three <i>log</i> [or more, of drawn waters] from the original amount. Two individuals who were dropping, this one a <i>log</i> and a half and that one a <i>log</i> and a half, into a <i>mikveh</i>; or one who wrings out his clothing and it drops [water into the <i>mikveh</i>] from many areas [of the clothing]; or one who pours out [water] from a tzirtzur [a stone vessel with a netted opening] and it drops from many areas [of the vessel]; Rabbi Akiva considers these [such cases] valid, and the Sages consider them invalid. Rabbi Akiva said, \"They did not say 'if they drop [three <i>log</i> of drawn waters, it is rendered invalid],' but rather 'if it drops.' [implying that it is only invalid if the water was dropped in from only one source]\" They said to him, \"They said neither this nor that. Rather [they said,] 'one that three <i>log</i> fell into it [is rendered invalid, and there is no distinction between dropping from one or multiple sources].'\"",
            "If [three <i>log</i> of drawn waters fell into a <i>mikveh</i>] from one vessel, from two, or from three, they join together [to add up to the required measure to render the <i>mikveh</i> invalid]; but from four [vessels], they do not join together. A <i>ba'al keri</i> [a male who has had a seminal emission but has yet to purify himself by immersion in a <i>mikveh</i>] who is ill, if nine <i>kav</i> [a specific volume measurement, equal to four <i>log</i>] fell on him [which the Sages established to be sufficient to purify him in such a case when he is ill and therefore cannot immerse], or a pure individual who three <i>log</i> of drawn waters fell on his head and the majority of his body [which the Sages established renders one impure], if [they fell on him] from one vessel, or from two, or from three, they join together [to add up to the minimum measure required to render them either pure or impure, respectively]; if from four, they do not join together [to add up to the required measure to have an effect]. Regarding what were these words said? Regarding a time when the second [vessel] began [pouring] before the first had stopped. And regarding what were these words said [i.e. that three <i>log</i> poured from four vessels, or not poured in close succession, do not join together to render a <i>mikveh</i> invalid]? Regarding a time when one did not intend to increase [the waters of the <i>mikveh</i>]; but if one did intended to increase, even [only by] a <i>kortov</i> every year, they do join together to three <i>log</i> [rendering the <i>mikveh</i> invalid]."

            "If one places vessels under a [drain] pipe, whether they are large vessels or whether they are small vessels, or even vessels made from feces, stone vessels, or earthen vessels, [if rainwater flowed through the pipe and into them] they invalidate a <i>mikveh</i> [a gathering of water collected by natural means and immersed in for purification; if the waters flow through these vessels and into a <i>mikveh</i> they invalidate it, since they are considered drawn waters]. Whether one places them [under the drainpipe] or forgets them, [this still applies,] according to Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel consider it pure [i.e. the waters do not render a <i>mikveh</i> invalid from being able to purify] in the case of one who forgets. Rabbi Meir says: they voted [on this matter], and Beit Shammai had the majority over Beit Hillel. And they [Beit Shammai] agree in case of one who forgets [vessels] in a courtyard, that it [a <i>mikveh</i> into which rainwater from those vessels was poured] is pure. Rabbi Yose says: the disagreement still stands in its place. ",

Rabbi Yose says: even for one of earthenware, [a furrow] of any size [is sufficient to invalidate waters flowing through a pipe]; they [the Sages] only said [that the minimum measure is] a <i>revi'it</i> regarding shards of earthenware vessels [that they are considered vessels as long as they can still contain that amount]. If there were stones rolling around inside it [the furrow], they [its waters] render a <i>mikveh</i> invalid. If dust descended into it and was compressed, it is valid. A duct which is narrow on either end and widens in the middle [built that way in order to increase water pressure] does not render [its waters] invalid, since it was not made to be a receptacle.",
            "Drawn water and rainwater that mixed in a courtyard, or in a hole, or on the upper steps of a cavern [and from there flowed into a <i>mikveh</i>], if the majority [of the water in the <i>mikveh</i>] is from the valid [waters], it is valid; if the majority is from the invalid, it is invalid; if it is half and half, it is invalid. When is this the case? At a time when they mix before they arrive at the <i>mikveh</i>. If they are flowing into the waters [of the <i>mikveh</i> directly, rather than first mixing together], if it is known that forty <i>se'ah</i> [a specific unit of volume] of valid water fell into it before three <i>log</i> [a specific measure of volume] of drawn water, it is valid; and if not, it is invalid.",
            "Regarding a trough in a rock [in which water gathers from a nearby spring], one may not fill [water to be sanctified with ashes of the red heifer] from it, and one may not sanctify [water with red heifer ashes] in it, and one may not sprinkle [sanctified waters, as part of the purification ritual,] from it, and it does not require a 'tight-seal' [to protect its contents from impurity, rather a mere covering suffices], and it does not invalidate a <i>mikveh</i> [if water gathered in the trough and then flowed into a <i>mikveh</i>, it is not considered drawn water]. If a vessel was attached [to the ground] with plaster, one may fill [water for sanctification] with it, and one may sanctify [water] in it, and one may sprinkle from it, and it requires a 'tight-seal' [to protect its contents from impurity], and it invalidates a <i>mikveh</i> [if water flowed in from it, it is considered to be drawn water and thus invalid]. If it was punctured from below or from the side, and it cannot hold any amount of water, it [any <i>mikveh</i> filled with its waters] is valid. And how far must the hole span? Like [the width of] the tube of a flask. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: It happened regarding the Yehu trough in Jerusalem, which was punctured like the tube of flask, and upon which all the purifications of Jerusalem were done, and Beit Shammai sent [emissaries] and diminished it, since Beit Shammai say: [even if it has a small hole, it is still considered a vessel and thus invalidates a <i>mikveh</i>] until the majority of it is diminished."

If it was led to pass over a pool and [then] it was stopped, it [the spring water in the pool] is thereby [considered to be] like a <i>mikveh</i> [a gathering of water collected by natural means and immersed in for purification].

If [however] any amount of water was floating above [the jagged edges], they are pure. A spring that flows [through and] out of an [impure] oven, if one descends and immerses in it, he is pure, but his hands are impure [since one's hands, but not one's body, are rendered impure by impure liquids, such as the liquid on his body once he emerges into the space of the impure oven]. If they [the spring's waters] rose above it [the oven] the height of his hands, even his hands are pure.",
            "<i>Mikvaot</i> are [considered] mixed [when they are connected by an opening] the size of the tube of a flask, alike to it in its width, and alike to it in [the length of] its hollow, such that two fingers can be rotated in place [i.e. its diameter should be the length of two fingers]. If there is an uncertainty as to whether it [the opening] was the size of the tube of a flask or was not the size of the tube of a flask, it is invalid because it is [a requirement] from the Torah [to immerse in a valid <i>mikveh</i>, and therefore we rule stringently on the matter]. Similarly [we rule stringently in a situation of uncertainty] regarding an olive's bulk of a corpse, and an olive's bulk of a carcass, and a lentil's bulk of a vermin. Anything that will stand in [an opening] the size of the tube of a flask, reduces it [from being that size, and thus from being able to be a connection between <i>mikvaot</i>]. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: any thing that is created out of the water is pure [i.e. does not reduce the size of the opening].",

One brings a pipe of earthenware or lead [and puts one end in the upper <i>mikveh</i>], and puts his hand under [the other end of] it until it fills with water, and he brings it and touches it [to the lower and valid <i>mikveh</i>] even by a hair's width; that is sufficient [to render the upper <i>mikveh</i> valid]. If the upper [<i>mikveh</i>] contained forty <i>se'ah</i> [of valid waters], and the lower one had nothing, one can fill [water] by one's shoulder [i.e. drawn water which one carried over] and add to the upper one, until forty <i>se'ah</i> flow down into the lower one.",

Rabbi Yehuda says: the matter is reversed. If they [the waters] breached into one another [i.e if the was top of the wall was breached and waters mix together there, a breach] the height of a garlic peel and the width of the tube of a flask [is sufficient for them to be considered combined].",

And the Sages say: if the tub can contain a <i>revi'it</i> [a specific measure of volume, a quarter of a <i>log</i>] before they [the waters] reach the drain, it is valid; and if not, it is invalid. Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Tzadok says: if the drain can contain any amount, it invalidates.",

How far must the hole span in order for it to contain three <i>log</i>? One three-hundred-twentieth of the pool [i.e. since three is one three-hundred-twentieth of 960, which is the number of <i>log</i> in forty <i>se'ah</i>], according to Rabbi Yose. Rabbi Elazar says: even if the lower one is full of valid [water] and the upper one is full of drawn water, and there are three <i>log</i> opposite the opening, it is valid, for they [the Sages] only said \"three <i>log</i> that fell\" [into a incomplete <i>mikveh</i> invalidate it; and such a case is not considered falling in]."

These raise and do not invalidate: snow, and hail, and frost, and ice, and salt, and mud that can be poured. Rabbi Akiva says: Rabbi Yishmael would rule against me, saying, \"Snow does not raise a <i>mikveh</i>.\" But the people of Midva testified in his name that he said to them, \"Go out and bring snow to make a <i>mikveh</i> from the outset.\" Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: A hailstone is like water. How do these raise and not invalidate? If there is a <i>mikveh</i> containing forty <i>se'ah</i> [a specific unit of volume] less one, and a <i>se'ah</i> [of one] of these fell into it, and raised it [to be a complete <i>mikveh</i> containing forty <i>se'ah</i>], we find thus that these raise and do not invalidate.",

If one immersed a thick wool coat [which absorbs a lot of water] in it, and raised it out, if a small part of it is touching the water [and another person then comes and immerses,] he is pure.
