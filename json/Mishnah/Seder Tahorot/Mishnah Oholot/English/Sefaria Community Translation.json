If three people become impure from a corpse, two become impure for seven days and one becomes impure until evening. If four people become impure from a corpse, three become impure for seven days and one becomes impure until evening. How do two [become impure]? One person touches a corpse and becomes impure for seven days, and any person who touches him becomes impure until evening.",

The fourth [object that touches the second set of vessels], regardless of whether it is a person or a vessel, becomes impure until evening. Rabbi Akiva said: I know of a case with a fifth. A tent-post that is stuck in a tent [in which there is a corpse], the tent and the post, and a person who touches the post, and vessels that touch the person, all are impure for seven days. The fifth [object that touches those vessels], regardless of whether it is a person or a vessel, becomes impure until evening. They said to him [to Rabbi Akiva]: The tent does not count.",

[There is a way in which] a person is more stringent than vessels, and [in which] vessels are more [stringent] than a person, in that the vessels are [able to pass impurity to] three and the person are [able to pass impurity to] two. A person is more stringent, in that so long as the person is in the middle, they are [able to pass impurity to] four. And when the person is not in the middle, they are [able to pass impurity to] three.",

[There is a way in which] a person is more stringent than garments, and [in which] garments are more [stringent] than a person, in that a person who touches a <i>Zav</i> [will in turn] make garments impure, but clothes that touch a <i>Zav</i> do not make other clothes impure. Clothes are more stringent, in that the clothes that carry a <i>Zav</i> make a person impure, but a person who carries a <i>Zav</i> does not make another person impure.",

And even someone dismembered or terminally ill, obligates in or exempts from levirate marriage, and qualifies or disqualifies one from eating <i>Terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a priest which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by priests or their household]. And so too domestic or wild animals do not impurify until their lives leave them. If their heads were cut off, even if they are convulsing, they impurify - like the tail of  a lizard which convulses [after being cut off].",

One hundred and one of this [side of the body], and one hundred and one of that. And eighteen vertebrates in the spinal chord: nine in the head, eight in the neck, six in the openings of the heart, and five around its cavities. Each of these impurifies through touching, carrying, or sharing quarters. When is this true? When the limbs still have an appropriate amount of flesh on them. But if they do not have an appropriate amount of flesh on them, they will impurify through touching and through carrying, but not through sharing quarters."

How much is a deficiency in the spine? The Beit Shammai say two vertebrae. Beit Hillel say even one vertebra. And in the skull? Beit Shammai say [the size of] a hole [made] by a drill, but Beit Hillel say as much as if it were taken from a living person he would die. Of what drill did they speak?

A <i>Rova</i> of bones that were crushed into small pieces, and there is not a single one of them that is the size of a grain of barley: Rabbi Shimon declares it [does not change others from being] pure, but the Sages declare them impure. A limb [severed] from a living person that was divided into two [does not change others from being] pure.

Two bones that have two half-olive volumes on them and he brought part of them inside and the house overshadows them, it is impure.

Rabbi Yehuda says close means there are none closer than it and old means that no one remembers [when] it [was created]. ",
            "One who found a corpse buried normally in the beginning, he may take it along with the surrounding dirt [to be reburied elsewhere]. If he found two [corpses], he may take them along with the surrounding dirt. [If] he found three, if there is between each of them from four to eight cubits, as much as a bier and its gravediggers, this is [considered] a graveyard [and cannot be desecrated]. [Therefore, he must] check from it and all around [for a distance of] twenty cubits. [If] he found one [corpse] a full twenty cubits away, [he must continue] to check from it and all around twenty cubits, because there is an established likelihood, for if in the beginning he found this [same corpse] he would have been able to take it along with the surrounding dirt.",
            "One who checks must check a cubit by a cubit and then may leave a cubit until he reaches a rock or virgin soil.  One who removes soil from an impure place can eat from his <i>Terumah</i> [A portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] but one who clears away a mound cannot eat from his <i>Terumah</i>.",
            "If he was checking and he reached a brook or a channel or a public road, he may stop. A field in which slain people were slain, he may gather bone by bone and everything is pure. One who removes a grave from his field, he may gather bone by bone and everything is pure. A pit into which miscarried fetuses or slain people were thrown, he may gather bone by bone and everything is pure. Rabbi Shimon says, if it was designated as a grave from the beginning, it has surrounding soil [that is considered impure and must also be collected]."

            "One who plows over a grave, this one makes a <i>Beit Pras</i> [a field in which a grave has been plowed over]. Up until where does he make it? A whole furrow, one hundred cubits long, four <i>Beit Se'ah</i> [a measure of area, equivalent to that area of land large enough to require a <i>Se'ah</i> of seeds to sow it]. Rabbi Yosi says, an area of five. On a downward or upward slope, he places a <i>Rova</i> [specific unit of volume] of vetch on the knee of the plow until the place where three vetches will sprout one next to the other, up until there he makes a <i>Beit Pras</i>. Rabbi Yossi says [this applies] on a downward slope but not an upward slope.",
            "If he was plowing and he hit a rock or a fence or if he shook the plow blade, until that point he makes the <i>Beit Pras</i>. Rabbi Eliezer says a <i>Beit Pras</i> can make a <i>Beit Pras</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua says there are times when it does make one, times when it does not make one. How so? If he plowed half a furrow and then plowed the other half and so too on the sides, this makes a <i>Beit Pras</i>, but if he plowed a whole furrow and then plowed it from there beyond, it does not make a <i>Beit Pras</i>.",
            "One who plows over a pit of bones or a pile of bones, a field in which a grave was lost in it, or in which a grave was found [after plowing], one who plows [a field] that is not his, and similarly a non-Jew who plowed, does not make it into a <i>Beit Pras</i> since there is no <i>Beit Pras</i> for Cuthites.",
            "If the <i>Beit Pras</i> field was above a pure one and rains washed from the <i>Beit Pras</i> to the pure one, even if the soil had been red and turned white or was white and turned red, it is not made into a <i>Beit Pras</i>. ",
            "A field in which a grave was lost, and they built a house with an upper story on top of it, if the doorway of the upper story was aligned with the doorway of the house, the upper story is pure, but if not the upper story is impure. Dirt of the <i>Beit Pras</i> and dirt of land outside the land of Israel which came in a vegetable combine [to become impure if their combined size is as large as] the seal of leather sacks says Rabbi Eliezer. But the Sages say [they do not become impure] until there is [the size of] the seal of leather sacks in one place. Rabbi Yehuda says, it once happened that letters came from overseas to the sons of the High Priests with a <i>Se'ah</i> or two <i>Se'ah</i> of seals but they [the Sages] were not concerned about their impurity.

            "How can one harvest grapes in the <i>Beit Pras</i> [a field in which a grave has been plowed over]? We sprinkle on the person and the vessels and repeat and they can harvest the grapes and take them out of the <i>Beit Pras</i>, and others receive from them and carry to the winepress. If these [people] touched those, they are impure according to the words of the House of Hillel.  The House of Shammai say, he holds the sickle with palm tree bark [which cannot become impure] or harvests the grapes with a rock and places them in a basket and take them to the winepress. Rabbi Yossi says, when is this the case? In a vineyard that became the <i>Beit Pras</i>, but if he planted in the <i>Beit Pras</i>, they should be sold in the market. ",
            "There are three types of <i>Beit Pras</i>, one who plows over a grave, it may be planted with any tree but cannot be sown with any seeds except for seeds which will be cut.  If he uprooted it, he must heap the threshing into it and sift it with two sieves, says Rabbi Meir. The Sages say, grain requires two sieves but legumes require three sieves. And he must burn the straw and the pea-stalks and it makes one impure by touching and by carrying but not by overshadowing. ",
            "A field in which a grave was lost, it may be sown with any seeds but cannot be planted with any tree, and trees are not maintained within it except for a shade-tree which does not bare fruits, and it makes one impure by touching and by carrying and by overshadowing.",
            "A wailing field may not be planted and may not be sown, but its soil is pure and they can make ovens for holy items out of it. And Beit  Shammai agree with Beit Hillel that it should be checked for [someone who passed through it and needs to bring] the Paschal offering but it does not need to be checked for [someone who passed through it and wants to eat] <i>Terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household]. For a <i>Nazir</i> [person who has sworn to abstain from all alcohol-related items, haircuts, and impurity], Beit Shammai say they must check but Beit  Hillel say they do not need to check. How does one check? He brings soil that can be moved and puts it through a sieve with narrow perforations and crushes it, if he finds a bone the size of a barley grain it is impure. ",
            "How does one make the <i>Beit Pras</i> pure? They take from it three handbreadths [of soil] or they add three handbreadths. If he took three handbreadths from one half of it and placed on it, on the other half of it, three handbreadths, it is pure. Rabbi Shimon says even if he took one and a half handbreadths from it and added one and a half handbreadths on it from elsewhere, it is pure. If one paved over the <i>Beit Pras</i> with stones that cannot be moved, it is pure. Rabbi Shimon says even if one tills the <i>Beit Pras</i>, it becomes pure. ",
            "One who walks through the <i>Beit Pras</i> on stones that he cannot move, or on a person or animal who have strength that is good, he is pure. On stones that he can move, or on a person or animal who have strength that is bad, he is impure. One who walks through the land of the [non-Jewish] nations on mountains or rocks, he is impure. By the sea or on a bluff, he is pure. What is the bluff? Any place where the sea rises during its storm.",
            "One who buys a field in Syria next to the Land of Israel, if he can enter it in purity, it is pure and it is obligated in tithes and in [the laws of] the Sabbatical year. If he cannot enter it in purity, it is impure and it is obligated in tithes and in [the laws of] the Sabbatical year. The dwelling places of non-Jews are impure. How long must they live there to [make the place] require checking? Forty days, even if a woman is not with him. If there was a slave or a woman watching it, it does not need checking.",
            "What do they need to check? Deep drains and standing water. Beit  Shammai say even garbage dumps and loose soil, but Beit Hillel say any place where a pig or a weasel can walk does not require checking. ",
            "The porches do not have [the laws] of the dwelling place of a non-Jew. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, a city of non-Jews which was destroyed does not have [the laws] of the dwelling place of a non-Jew. East Caesarea and West Caesarea are graveyards. East Akko was in doubt but the Sages purified it. Rebbi and his court voted on Keini and purified it.",
