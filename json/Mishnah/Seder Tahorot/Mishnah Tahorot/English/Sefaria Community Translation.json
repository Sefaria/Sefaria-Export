            "Thirteen matters regarding the carcass of a pure fowl: it requires thought [i.e. one must initially think to use it for food, in order for it have the impurity of foods]; and it does not necessitate becoming primed [for impurity, unlike other foods, which are primed for impurity when they become wet]; and it renders foods impure [upon contact] when it has [at least the volume] equivalent to an egg; and [it renders one impure] while it is being swallowed when it has [at least the volume] equivalent to an olive; and one who eats it requires [waiting until] sunset [on the day of his immersion before he becomes pure again]; and [if rendered impure] by it, one would be liable for entering the temple; and [one rendered impure by it renders <i>terumah</i> impure, such that the] <i>terumah</i> needs to be burned on its account; and one who eats a limb taken from it while alive endures the forty [lashes]. According to Rabbi Meir, its slaughter or its <i>melikah</i> [ritual killing of fowl brought as sacrifices in the temple] purify [the pure fowl, if it was discovered to have been] a <i>treifah</i> [an animal which will not survive, and is generally rendered impure and cannot be eaten]. Rabbi Yehuda says: they do not purify. Rabbi Yose says: its slaughter purifies, but its <i>melikah</i> does not. [The first nine of the thirteen matters are listed in this Mishna; the final four appear in the following Mishna.]",
            "The wings and the feathers [of the carcass of a pure fowl] can be rendered impure and can render [other items] impure, and they are not added together [to reach a volume measure sufficient for causing impurity]. Rabbi Yishmael says: the feather is added [to complete the sufficient measure]. The beak and the talons render impure and they are added together. Rabbi Yose says: even the tips of the wings and the tip of the tail are added together, as they are left on the fatted [birds, for serving].",
            "The carcass of an impure fowl requires thought [one must initially think to use it for food] and being primed [for impurity, by becoming wet]; and it renders foods impure when it has [at least the volume] equivalent to an egg, and [at least the volume] equivalent to half a loaf invalidates one's body [from eating <i>terumah</i> by rendering him impure]; and it does not have [the law of rendering one impure] when it is being swallowed when it has [at least the volume] equivalent to an olive; and one who eats it does not require [waiting until] sunset [on the day of his immersion before he becomes pure again]; and one is not liable for entering the temple [while impure] because of it; but <i>terumah</i> is burned on its account [i.e. one rendered impure by it renders <i>terumah</i> impure]; and one who eats a limb taken from it while alive does not endure the forty [lashes]; and slaughtering it does not purify it. The wings and feathers can be rendered impure, and can render impure, and are added together. The beak and the talons can be rendered impure, can render impure, and are added together.  ",
            "And regarding an animal: the hide, the sauces [in which it is cooked], the seasonings, the meat stuck to the hide, the bones, the sinews, the horns, and the hooves combine to render impure with the impurity of foods, but not with the impurity of carcasses. Similarly, one who slaughters an impure animal for a gentile and it is still twitching, it can render impure with the impurity of foods, but not with the impurity of carcasses until it dies or until its head is chopped off. The rendering of the impurity of foods was made more numerous than the rendering of the impurity of carcasses. ",
            "Food which has become impure from an origin of impurity [and has thus attained a first degree level of impurity], and [food] which has become impure from a generated impurity [such as something of a first degree level, causing it, in turn, to attain a second degree level of impurity], they are added together to impart impurity [at the level] of the less stringent of the two. How so? The equivalent [in volume] of half an egg of food of a first degree [level of impurity] and the equivalent [in volume] of half an egg of a second degree [level of impurity] that one mixed with each other, [the mixture] is of a second degree.  The equivalent of half an egg of a second degree and the equivalent of half an egg of a third degree that one mixed with each other, [the mixture] is of a third degree.  The equivalent of a full egg of a first degree and the equivalent of a full egg of a second degree that one mixed with each other, [the mixture] is of a first degree; but if one [then] divided them [into two], this one is of a second degree and this one is of a second degree. If one [of these two] fell on its own and [the other] one [also fell] on its own onto a loaf of <i>terumah</i>, they invalidate it [by giving it a third degree level of impurity]. If both fell at once they render it to be of a second degree [impurity, since it came into contact with a full egg's measure of food of a first degree impurity].  ",

If one [of these two] fell on its own, and [the other] one [also fell] on its own onto a loaf a <i>terumah</i>, it has not invalidated it [since <i>terumah</i> is not made impure by something of third degree impurity]. If both fell at once they render it to be of a third degree [impurity]. The equivalent of an egg [in volume] of first degree food and the equivalent of an egg [in volume] of third degree food that one mixed with each other, [the mixture] is of a first degree; if one divided them [into two], this one is of a second degree and this one is of a second degree, since even that of a third degree, when it touched that of a first degree, it became of a second degree. The equivalent of two eggs [in volume] of first degree food and the equivalent of two eggs [in volume] of a second degree food that one mixed with each other, [the mixture] is of a first degree; if one divided them [into two], this one is of a first degree and this one is of a first degree; if [one divided them] into three or four, they are [all] of a second degree. The equivalent of two eggs [in volume] of second degree food and the equivalent of two eggs [in volume] of third degree that one mixed with each other, [the mixture] is of a second degree; if one divided them [into two], this one is of a second degree and this one is of a second degree;  if [one divided them] into three or four, they are [all] of a third degree.",

If they were [then] separated, they are all [still] primary [in their impurity]. Regarding liquids [that are similarly touching each other, if one liquid is rendered impure by impure liquids, which are always of a first degree level of impurity, then] they are all of a second degree [level of impurity]; if they were [then] separated, they are all [still] of a second degree.

With [loaves of] <i>terumah</i>, [a vermin that comes into contact with one of them] makes two [loaves] impure and invalidates one [i.e the first loaf that touched the vermin becomes impure in the first degree, and any loaf that touches that loaf becomes impure in the second degree, and any loaf touching that loaf becomes impure in the third degree and thus is still invalid for <i>terumah</i>, but it does not cause any more impurity]. If there is dripping liquid between them, even with [loaves of] <i>terumah</i>, everything is impure [because the liquid, which is made primary by the loaves, and which causes the loaves it then touches to become secondary, and those loaves, in turn, cause the water touching the next loaves to become primary, and so on, to all the loaves].

If she touched a wet part, if it has [at least] the equivalent of an egg [in volume], everything is impure; if it does not have the equivalent of an egg, it is impure and everything [else] is pure.

Rabbi Yehoshua says: One who eats foods of a first degree or of a second degree is [rendered] of a second degree; [one who eats foods] of a third degree, [he is rendered] of second degree for sanctified foods, but not for <i>terumah</i>, [and this applies] with non-sacred food prepared with the purity stringency of <i>terumah</i> [since regular non-sacred foods do not have third degree impurity].

But if they were prepared [only] with the purity stringency of <i>terumah</i>, it [<i>terumah</i> of a third degree] renders, with regard to sanctified foods, two impure [i.e. creates, upon contact, a first degree impurity and, in turn, a second degree impurity] and invalidates one [in turn, to be a third degree level of impurity, but not a fourth degree; this is because foods prepared with the purity stringency of <i>terumah</i> are still impure at a first degree level with regard to sanctified foods, but they do not retain a fourth degree impurity, since <i>terumah</i> cannot retain a fourth degree of impurity].

First degree sanctified foods, <i>terumah</i> foods, and non-sanctified foods, [all] render two impure and invalidate one with regard to sanctified foods; [they all] render one impure and invalidate one with regard to <i>terumah</i>; and they invalidate non-sanctified foods [by rendering them impure]. The second degree [foods] for all [of these three categories], render one impure and invalidate one with regard to sanctified foods, render non-sanctified liquids impure, and invalidate [foods, by rendering them impure] for those who eat <i>terumah</i>.

And non-sacred foods that were prepared with the stringency of sacred foods still follow the rules of non-sacred foods [i.e. unlike sacred foods, they cannot be rendered third degree by a second degree impurity, nor are they rendered fourth degree by a third degree impurity].  Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Tzadok says: In fact they are like <i>terumah</i>, in that [if they touch an origin of impurity] two are rendered impure [those rendered of a first and second degree impurity] and one is invalidated [that of a third degree; and it does not produce a fourth].

Rabbi Shimon says: if the workers consider them [the impure vessels] to be pure, the olive press is impure; and if they consider them to be impure, the olive press is pure. Rabbi Yose says: why are they [the workers, considered] impure? Because <i>amei ha'aretz</i> [unlearned individuals, uneducated about matters of purity] are not experts with regard to shifting [the position of something impure, even without touching it, which is one way impurity can be transferred]. ",
            "If olive press workers are entering and exiting, and there are impure liquids in the olive press, if between the liquids and the olives there is enough room for them to dry their feet on the ground, these are thereby pure. If something impure was found before olive press workers and olive harvesters, they are believed to say, \"We did not touch [the impurity].\"  And similarly regarding the young children among them [who are assumed to be impure, the workers are believed to say they did not touch them]. They [the workers] can go outside through the entrance to the olive press and turn to the back of the fence [to relieve themselves], and they are pure. How far may they go and still remain pure?  As far as he [the owner of the press] can still see them. ",
            "Regarding olive press workers and olive harvesters, once he [the owner of the olive press] brings them into the area of the cave [containing a <i>mikvah</i> for ritual immersion], that is sufficient [for him to assume that they immersed themselves and their vessels, and are all pure], according to Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose says: he must stand over them until they immerse. Rabbi Shimon says: if they consider them [themselves and the vessels requiring immersion] to be pure, he must stand over them until they immerse; but if they consider them impure, he does not have to stand over them until they immerse.",
            "If one takes [grapes to the vat for pressing] from a basket or from an area on the ground designated for spreading them out, Beit Shammai says: he must take them with pure hands, and if he took them with impure hands he has rendered them impure. Beit Hillel says: he may take them with impure hands, and he separates his <i>terumah</i> from them in purity. If [one takes the grapes to the vat] from the large basket [into which the grapes are harvested, before being brought to the wine press] or from a leaf-covered area designated for spreading them out, everyone is in agreement that he must take them with pure hands, and if he took them with impure hands he has rendered them impure. ",
            "One [with impure hands] who eats [grapes] out of baskets or from an area on the ground designated for spreading them out, even if they are split open and dripping into the wine press, the wine press remains pure. If [he was eating grapes] from the large basket or from a leaf-covered area designated for spreading them out, and a single grape fell from them [into the wine press], if it has a seal [i.e. if its stem is still attached] it [the wine press and its contents] is pure, but if it does not have a seal [i.e. if it is missing its stem, and its juice can flow out], it is impure.  If grapes fell from him [who was eating them, with impure hands,] and one stepped on them in a cleared out area [of the wine press, containing no grapes or wine], if it was exactly equivalent to an egg [in volume], it [the wine press, and its contents,] is pure; if it was more than the equivalent of an egg [in volume], it is impure, since when the first drop left it was rendered impure by an amount [of liquids] equivalent to an egg [in volume, and it can therefore go on to render the vat and its contents impure]. ",
            "If one was standing and speaking at the edge of a [wine] pit, and a stream of saliva flew from his mouth, and there is an uncertainty as to whether it reached the pit or not, its uncertainty is pure [i.e. its status is uncertain and therefore pure]. ",
            "If one empties a pit [of wine into barrels], and a vermin was found in the first [barrel he filled], they are all impure. If [it was found] in the last one [he filled], it is impure and all the rest are pure. When is this the case? When he empties into each one individually. But if he was emptying with a ladle, if a vermin was found in one of them, that one alone is impure. When is this the case? When he inspects [each barrel, before emptying wine into it] but does not cover [each one after emptying in the wine], or he covers [each barrel] but does not inspect. If he was inspecting [each one] and then covering, and a vermin was found in one of the barrels, everything is impure; if [it was found] in the pit, everything is impure; if [it was found] in the ladle, everything is impure. ",
            "Between the rollers [heavy stones used to press the last of the juice from the grapes after they have been trampled] and the [already trampled] grape skins is a public domain [for matters of impurity]. The [part of the] vineyard before the grape harvesters [i.e. not yet harvested] is a private domain; behind the harvesters is a public domain. When is this the case? When the public enters through one [end of the vineyard] and exits through another. The vessels of an olive-press, and of a [wine] vat, and a basket press, when they are made of wood, [if they become impure] one may dry them and they are pure; when they are made of reeds, [if they become impure] one must let them age for twelve months [without using them], or rinse them in hot water. Rabbi Yose says: if he put them in a fast moving river, it is sufficient [for ridding them of their impurity]. "
