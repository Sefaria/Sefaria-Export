            "One who prepares breads in order to separate them (for the priest's tithe), and bites them--the House of Shammai says: he has exacted usury concerning the priestly food of the day; the House of Hillel says: he has not exacted usury.  If two pieces of dough stick together, or if two loaves stick together, or if one bakes one batter-cake on top of another before the loaf developed a slight crust  in the oven, or froth, or the boiling of beans, or the boiling of \"new\" wine (of the produce lawfully not yet fit for use), and Rabbi Judah says: even that of using \"new\" cedar wood--the House of Shammai says: he has exacted usury concerning the priestly food of the day; the House of Hillel says: he has not exacted usury. But they (the Houses of Hillel and Shammai) agree (stringently) in the remainder of the questions of the impurities, whether light or severe.",

            "A knob that is behind a loaf, a small salt morsel, or a burnt crust less than a finger's breadth, Rabbi Yose says: Whatever is eaten with it is rendered impure by a Tevul Yom, and needless to say [the same applies] to any other impurity.", 
            "A pebble in a loaf, a big salt morsel, or a lupine, or a burnt crust more than a finger's breadth, Rabbi Yose says: Whatever is not eaten with it is ritually pure of an Av Hatum'ah, and needless to say of a Tevul Yom.", 
            "Barley and spelt which are not peeled, Crowfoot root, Asafoetida and Silphium -- Rabbi Yehuda says: Also Black Beans -- are ritually pure of an Av Hatum'a, and needless to say of a Tevul Yom. So says Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: They are pure of a Tevul Yom but impure of any other impurity. Barley and spelt which are peeled, and wheat regardless of whether it is peeled or not, Black cumin, Sesame or Pepper -- Rabbi Yehuda says: Also White Beans -- are ritually impure of a Tevul Yom, and needless to say of any other impurities."

            "Liquids that come out of one who immersed that day (tevul yom) are like those which he has touched: neither of them defile   With regard to all others that are impure, be they of minor  or major  [degree], the liquids that come out of them are like those they touch; both have first degree impurity.   Except for liquid that is a \"father of impurity.\"  ", 
            "A pot which was full of liquid and one who immersed that day (tevul yom) touched it:\nIf it is terumah, the liquid is disqualified, but the pot is pure.  \nBut if the liquid is non-sacred [hullin] then all remains clean.  \nIf his hands were defiled [and he touched the liquids in the pot], it is all impure.   \nThis is a case where defiled hands are treated more stringently than one who immersed that day (tevul yom).\nBut there is a greater stringency for one who immersed that day (tevul yom) than fore defiled hands, since a doubtful tevul yom disqualifies terumah, but doubts with regard to defiled hands are pure.\n", 
            "Porridge made of terumah and the garlic or oil [it contained] was of non-sacred stuff, and one who immersed that day (a tevul yom) touched part of them, he has disqualified the whole thing;   \nBut if the porridge was of non-sacred stuff and the garlic or oil it contained was of terumah, and a tevul yom touched part of them, he disqualifies only the part he has touched.   \nIf the greater part was garlic then they go after the majority.   \nRabbi Judah said: When is this so? When it formed one cohesive mass in the pot, but if it was scattered in the mortar, then it is pure, since he wishes that it should be scattered.   \n[Similarly] with all other mashed foods which were mashed with liquids. \nBut those which are usually mashed with liquids and yet were mashed without liquids, though they formed one lump in the pot, they are regarded as a cake of preserved figs.\n", 
            "The porridge and batter-cake were of non-sacred stuff and oil of terumah was floating above them, and one who immersed that day (a tevul yom) touched the oil, he disqualifies only the oil. \nIf he stirred it together, all the places where the oil goes are disqualified.\n", 
            "Sanctified meat over which the porridge crusted, and one who immersed that day (a tevul yom) touched the crust, the slices [of meat] are permitted.\nIf he touched a slice, that slice and all [the crust] that comes up with it form a connective one with the other. \nRabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: the two of them serve as connectives to each other.   \nSimilarly, with [cooked] beans that have formed a layer over pieces of bread.   \nBeans cooked in a pot: when they are still separate, do not serve as connectives; but when they become a lump, they do act as connectives. \nIf they formed several lumps, they are to be counted.   \nOil which floats on wine and a tevul yom touched the oil, he disqualifies only the oil.\nRabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: each serves as a connective with the other.\n",

            "A jug which had a hole either at its mouth, its bottom or its sides, and one who immersed that day (a tevul yom) touched it,  it is impure.   \nRabbi Judah says: if the hole is at its mouth or bottom it is impure; but if on its sides, on this side or on that, it is pure.   \nOne who pours [liquid] from vessel to vessel, and a tevul yom touched the stream, if there was something in [the vessel], then it is neutralized in a hundred and one.\n",

            "One who takes terumah from a cistern and said: \"Let this be terumah provided it comes up safely,\" [it means] safely from breakage or spillage but not from impurity.  \nRabbi Shimon says: also from impurity.   \nIf it broke, it does not render [the contents of the cistern] to be a mixture containing terumah. \nHow far away can it be broken and still not make [the contents of the cistern] a mixture containing terumah? As far back so that if it rolls , it can reach the cistern.   \nRabbi Yose says: even if one had the intention of making such a stipulation, but did not do so, and it broke, it does not make the [contents of the cistern] a mixture containing terumah, for this is a stipulation laid down by the court.\n"
