            "Rabbi Eliezer says: A calf [as referred to in the Torah] is a year old, and a cow is two years old. And the Sages say: a calf is two year old, and a cow is three or four. Rabbi Meir says: Even a five year old, an elderly one, is valid [for use in the purification ritual of the red heifer] but we don't wait for it [to age] lest it develop black hairs, so it does not become invalid. Rabbi Yehoshua says: I have only heard about a <i>shelashit</i> [i.e. three years old]. They said to him: What is the meaning of the language <i>shelashit</i>? He said to them: So I heard it, unelaborated. Ben Azzai said: I shall explain. If the language was <i>shelishit</i> [literally: third], then [it means] the third in number [i.e. the third calf born]; but since the language was <i>shelashit</i>, then [it means] three years old. They spoke similarly regarding a <i>revai</i> vineyard [the fruit of vines and trees in the fourth year after their planting. This produce, or its redemption value, must be taken up to Jerusalem and consumed there in ritual purity.]. They said to him: What is the language of <i>revai</i>?  He said to them: So I heard it, unelaborated. Ben Azzai said: I shall explain. If the language was <i>revi'i</i> [literally: fourth], then [it means] the fourth relative to others in number [i.e. the fourth vineyard which a man owns]; but since the language is <i>revai</i>, then [it means] four years old. Similarly they said: One [becomes impure] if he eats in a blighted house half a loaf, when there are three [loaves] to a <i>kav</i> [volume measure, equals 4 <i>log</i>, ⅙  <i>se’ah</i>]. They said to him: [Instead] say 'when there are eighteen [loaves] to a <i>se'ah</i>' [measure of volume, equals 6 <i>kav</i>]! He said to them: So I heard it, unelaborated. Ben Azzai said: I shall explain. If you say 'when there are three [loaves] to a <i>kav</i>,' that is without its <i>challah</i> [a portion of a batch of bread dough given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] removed. But when you say 'when there are eighteen [loaves] to a <i>se'ah</i>', that is with its <i>challah</i> removed.",
            "Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: Bulls [as referred to in the Torah], are two years old, as it says (Numbers 8): And a second bull the son of a bovine you will take for a sin offering. And the Sages say: Even three years old. Rabbi Meir says: Even four years old and five years old are acceptable, but older ones are not brought, as a matter of respect.",
            "Sheep [as referred to in the Torah] are one year old. And Rams [refers to ones who] are two years old. And all of them [are counted] from day to day [i.e. their years are counted from the day of their birth]. At thirteen months old niether a ram nor a sheep is valid [as a sacrifice].  R' Tarfon called it a \"pleg'es.\" Ben Azzai called it a \"nokad.\" R' Yishmael called it a \"parchadigma.\" If it was offered, they bring with it wine libations of a ram and it doesn't count to the alter [i.e. to fulfill any obligations]. At thirteen months and one day it is considered a ram.",

If they one brought them on the eighth day, they are valid. Vowed and voluntary offerings, the first born animal, the tithe, and the Passover sacrifice are valid from the eighth day and onward, and even on the eighth day."

And the Sages validate [purchasing a red heifer from gentiles]. And furthermore all communal and individual sacrifices [may] come either from the Land [of Israel] or from outside of the Land, either from the new [grain, harvested in the new year but before the omer sacrifice is brought on Pesach, and forbidden until after the sacrifice] or from the old [grain], except for the omer and the two loaves [offered on Shavuot] which may only be brought from the new [grain] and from the Land.",

The eyeball, the teeth and the tongue do not invalidate it [from being entirely red, if they are black]. The runt is valid. [If] it had a boil which was cut off, Rabbi Yehudah invalidates it; Rabbi Shimon says: Any time a removal occurred and red hair did not grow in its place is invalid.",
            "One [a red heifer] born through a Caesarean section [literally: came out through a wall], one given as payment [for a harlot], or as a price [for a dog] are invalid. Rabbi Eliezer validates [them], as the verse says: (Deuteronomy 23:19) \"Do not bring a harlot's payment or the price of a dog to the house of Hashem your G-d,\" and this one, [the red heifer,] does not come to the house. All the blemishes which invalidate sacrifices invalidate the [red] heifer. [If] one rode on it, leaned on it, hung from its tail, used it to cross a river, doubled the reins over it, [or] placed his cloak on it, it is invalid. But if he tied it with a rein, made a shoe for it to prevent slipping, [or] spread his cloak over it because of the flies, it is valid. This is the rule: anything [done] for its own needs [that of the heifer], it is valid. For any other needs, it is invalid.",
            "If a bird rested on it, it is valid. If a male mounted it, it is invalid. Rabbi Yehudah says: If one caused [the male] to mount, it is invalid. If [it mounted] on its own accord, it is valid.",
            "[If] it had two black or white hairs from one pore, it is invalid. Rabbi Yehudah says: even from one cup [a bump of flesh from which several hairs grow]. If they [the two hairs] are from two cups, and they prove one another [giving indication that they grew in tandem], it is invalid. Rabbi Akiva says: Even four or even five scattered [hairs], they should be plucked [and the cow is valid].\" Rabbi Eliezer says: Even fifty.  Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira says: Even one at its head and one at its tail invalidate it. [If] it had two hairs whose roots are black and tips are red, [or] whose roots are red and tips are black, everything follows after the appearance [i.e. the tips], these are the words of Rabbi Meir; and the Sages say: after the root."

            "Seven days before the heifer is burnt, the priest who will burn the heifer is separated from his house to a chamber that is in front of the [main temple] building, in the Northeast, and it was called the Stone House, and he is sprinkled all seven days with all the [ashes of the] <i>chata'ot</i> [red heifers] that were [ever] there. Rabbi Yose says: They would only sprinkle on him on the third and seventh [days] alone. Rabbi Chanina the deputy priest says: On the priest who burns the heifer, they sprinkle all seven days; and on the priest [who performs the sacrificial services] of Yom Kippur, they would only sprinkle on the third and seventh [days] alone.",
            "There were courtyards in Jerusalem built on rock and below them was hollow because of graves of the deep. [Stepping over a human grave causes ritually impurity, which can be blocked by a sufficiently wide space between the body and the covering; by building a courtyard over a hollow, one guarantees that any graves which are too deep to be discovered can not make people in the courtyard above impure.] They would bring pregnant women to there [these courtyards], and they would give birth there and raise their children there [to ensure that the children never become ritually impure]. They would bring oxen and on their backs slats [literally: doors] and the children would sit on top of them with stone cups in their hands.  When they reached the Shiloach [stream], they would descend and fill [the cups], and remount and sit atop them. Rabbi Yose says: From his place [atop the oxen] one would lower and fill [his cup].",
            "They [the children] would come to the temple mount and descend [from the oxen]. The temple mount and the temple courtyards underneaths were hollow due to the graves of deep [so that they temple service should be done in purity]. At the entrance to the temple courtyard there was a stone jug containing [the ashes] of a <i>chatat</i> [red heifer], and they would bring a male sheep and tie a rope between its horns, and tie a stick with branches at the top of the rope, and throw [the stick] into the jug, and hit the male [sheep] such that it would jump backwards [pulling the stick out of the jar and scattering some ashes], and he [the child] would take the [scattered] ashes and sanctify [them by mixing them with the water in the cup], an amount such that the ashes may be seen on the surface of the water. Rabbi Yose says: Do not give the Saducees [a second-temple-era sect who only believed in the validity of the written Torah and not the oral Torah] room to rebel [i.e. to make fun of us]; rather, he [the child] would remove [the ashes from the jug himself] and sanctify [them by mixing them with water].",
            "They would do neither one <i>chatat</i> on the back of another <i>chatat</i>, nor one child on the back of his friend. [i.e. if the purification process was performed for one red heifer, one would not then rely on that same process for another red heifer; rather the whole process would be repeated. Similarly, a child who was raised for the ritual for one heifer would not be used for another.] And the children were required to undergo sprinkling [to be purified]. Rabbi Akiva says: They were not required to undergo sprinkling.",
            "If they could not find [the ashes] from [all] seven [red heifers, the seven that were made in times of the temple], they would use from six, from five, from four, from three, from two, or from one [depending on how many they found]. And who made these [seven]? The first Moses made, the second Ezra made, and five from Ezra and onward, according to Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say: Seven [were made] from Ezra and onward; and who made them? Shimon the righteous and Yochanan the high priest made two each, Elyehoeinai ben Hakof and Chanamel the Egyptian and Yishmael  ben Pi'avi each made one .",
            "And they would make a ramp from the temple mount to the mount of anointing [the Mount of Olives], arches on top of arches, and [hollow] domes over the foundations, because of graves of the deep, for on it the priest who would burn the heifer, and the heifer and all its helpers would leave to the mount of anointing.",
            "If the heifer did not want to leave, they could not lead it with a black [cow], lest [the public] say, \"they slaughtered the black one.\" Nor [could they lead it] with a red one, lest they say, \"they slaughtered two.\" Rabbi Yose says: Not for this reason, but rather because the verse says (Numbers 19:3), \"And he shall take her out,\" [her] alone. And the elders of Israel would precede it by foot to the mount of anointing, and a house for ritual immersion was there. And they would make the priest who would burn the cow ritually impure because of the Saducees, so they would not say, \"it was done by one for whom the sun had set.\" [There are various forms of ritual impurity for which to become totally pure, one must immerse in water and then wait until the next sunset. The Saducees believed that the priest who burnt the red cow needed to be totally pure such that he'd only be allowed to do it if he waited for sunset. The sages held that he is able to burn the cow, even after only immersing in water, thus they made him impure and had him immerse so that everyone could see that they were not following the opinion of the Saducees.]",
            "They [the elders] would lean their hands on him [the priest] and say, \"Our man, great priest, immerse once.\" He would descend and immerse and arise and dry. And wood was arranged there: wood of erez, oran, brosh [various types of cedar wood] and wood of smooth fig trees. And they would make from them a type of tower, and they would open  windows [holes] in it, and it would face Westwards.",
            "They would tie [the heifer] with a rope of rubber and place it upon the pyre, its head in the South and its face Westward. The priest would stand in the East and his face Westward. He would slaughter with his right hand, and receive [the blood] with his left. Rabbi Yehuda says: He would receive with his right and [then] place it in his left. And he would sprinkle [the blood] with his right. He would immerse [his finger into the blood] and sprinkle seven times in the direction of the holy of holies. For each sprinkling a [separate] immersion. Upon finishing the sprinkling, he would wipe his hands on the body of the cow, descend [from the pyre] and ignite the fire with twigs. Rabbi Akiva says: with branches.",
            "It would split, [the heifer, due to the flames,] and he [the priest] would stand outside the pit [region designated for the burning], and he would take cedar wood, hyssop and worm silk. He would say to them [to the elders there], \"Is this cedar wood? Is this cedar wood? Is this hyssop? Is this hyssop? Is this worm [silk]? Is this worm [silk]?\" Three times for each one. And they would say to him, \"Yes, and yes,\" three times for each one.",
            "He would wrap them [the cedar wood, hyssop and worm silk] with the remainder of the strand [of worm silk] and throw them into her [the heifer's] fire. Once burnt, they would beat it [the remains] with sticks, and sift it with sieves [to produce fine ashes]. Rabbi Yishmael says: with stone slabs and with stone sieves they would do it. Black [charcoal] containing ashes, they would crush it. And [charcoal] not containing [ashes], they would leave [at the pyre]. The bones, either way [whether or not they contained ashes] would be crushed. And they would divide [the ashes] into three portions: one would be placed in the <i>cheil</i> [a low fence and area around the Temple, which served as a boundary, beyond which entry to those impure was prohibited], and one would be placed on the mount of anointing, and one would be distributed among all the priestly rotations."

            "A <i>chatat</i> heifer that was slaughtered not for its sake [i.e. without the intention that it be for the ritual of the red heifer], [or if the blood] was collected and sprinkled not for its sake, or [if any of these parts of the service were performed] for its sake [initially] and not for its sake [afterwards], or not for its sake [initially] and for its sake [afterwards]--it is invalid [in all of these cases]. Rabbi Eliezer validates it. And if [it was performed by a priest] with unwashed hands and feet, it is invalid. Rabbi Eliezer validates it. And if it was not [performed by] the high priest, it is invalid. Rabbi Yehuda validates it. And if he was lacking garments [i.e. he wasn't wearing all the mandated priestly garments], it is invalid. And it was performed in the white garments [used also for parts of the Yom Kippur service].",

If it was sprinkled but not directed towards the opening [of the temple], it is invalid. If the sixth [sprinkling] was used to [also] perform the seventh sprinkling, [even] if he went back [and dipped] and sprinkled a seventh, it is invalid.

If an invalidation occurs with her slaughter, the clothing does not become impure. If it occurs with the sprinkling, the clothing of anyone involved with it before the invalidation becomes impure, and the clothing of those involved with it after the invalidation does not become impure. We find that the stringency provides a leniency [in that a stringency which invalidates acts as a leniency with respect to whether the clothing is made impure]. There is always <i>me'ilah</i> with it [me'ilah is the transgression of benefitting from sanctified property, see tracate Me'ilah for details], and one may add wood [to the pyre while its being burnt], and it [the ritual] is performed during the day and by a priest. [Other] work [done by the priest at the same time] invalidates it, until it is made into ashes.

And regarding <i>trumah</i> [a portion separated from grains and fruit grown in Israel and given to a priest, and which must be kept pure], one should open the furnace and take it [to ensure that the vessel stays pure].

However, if a vessel which cannot become impure or an earthenware vessel are tightly fitted with a cover, or 'tight seal,' the inside is considered protected from the outside and thus things inside cannot become impure.  Similarly, if a sealed vessel is inside an earthenware vessel, despite the fact that a ritually impure object placed in the earthenware vessel makes everything inside it impure, the contents of a tightly sealed vessel which is incapable of becoming impure nonetheless remain pure.

If [one intended to sprinkle] onto a person, and he sprinkled onto an animal, if there is [still some of the sanctified water] in the hyssop, he need not repeat [his dipping]. If [he intended] onto an animal, and he sprinkled onto a person,  [even] if there is [still some water] in the hyssop, he must repeat. The waters that drip [from the hyssop, if it was dipped for sprinkling onto something that cannot retain purity,] they are valid [for sprinkling, if they fall into a pure vessel, and if one then dips the hyssop into them for sprinkling]; therefore they cause impurity as <i>chatat</i> waters [which render impure those who carry or touch them].",
            "One who sprinkles [onto another individual] from a public window, and he [the sprinkled individual, assuming he has been purified,] enters the temple, and [subsequently] the waters [he was sprinkled with] are found to have been invalid, he is exempt. [One who sprinkles] from a private window, and [the sprinkled individual then] enters the temple, and [subsequently] the waters are found to have been invalid, he is liable. But a high priest, whether [he was sprinkled with waters] from a private window or from a public window, he is exempt, for the high priest is not liable for entering the temple [impure]. They used to slip [on the left over <i>chatat</i> waters spilled] in front of the public window, and they would trample it, but they did not refrain [from doing so, and from entering the temple afterwards], for they said: <i>Chatat</i> waters that have done their mitzva do not cause impurity.",
            "One who is pure can grasp an impure axe in a fold of his clothing and have one sprinkle onto it. Even if [after the sprinkling] it has on it a [sufficient] amount of water for sprinkling, he is pure. [Generally carrying <i>chatat</i> waters renders one impure, but in this case the waters have already done their mitzva, as noted in the previous Mishna.] And how much must the waters be in order to be an amount for sprinkling? [Enough] that one may dip the tips of the stalks and sprinkle. Rabbi Yehuda says: We view them as if they were on a hyssop of copper [i.e. we also take into account water which has been absorbed and is no longer visible, since copper does not absorb].",
            "One who sprinkles with an impure hyssop, if it has [the volume] equivalent to an egg, the waters are invalid, and his sprinkling is invalid. If it does not have [the volume] equivalent to an egg, the waters are valid, and his sprinkling is invalid. And it renders its fellow [hyssop] impure, and its fellow [renders] its fellow [impure], even if there are a hundred of them.",
            "One who is pure for <i>chatat</i>, and whose hands became impure, his body becomes impure, and he renders impure his fellow, and his fellow [renders impure] his fellow, even if there are a hundred of them.",
            "A jug of <i>chatat</i> [waters] whose outsides became impure, its inside [subsequently] becomes impure, and it renders its fellow [jug] impure, and its fellow [renders impure] its fellow, even of there are a hundred of them. The bell and the clapper are [considered] joined [for purity purposes and for sprinkling, and thus if one becomes impure so does the other, and sprinkling on one purifies the other]. A spindle for ruban [a kind of reed, used for weaving mats], one [who wishes to purify the spindle] should not sprinkle [only] on the rod or on the weight; and if one sprinkled [on one of them], it is a [valid] sprinkling [and the entire spindle is rendered pure]. A [spindle] for flax, [the parts are considered] joined. The leather [lining] of a cradle that is attached to its buttons, is [considered] joined. The frame [of a bed] is not [considered] joined, neither for impurity nor for purity. All the drilled handles of vessels [i.e. hollowed out handles, where part of the vessel sticks into them] are [considered] joined. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: even the inserted [i.e. the handles which are themselves pointed and are stuck into a hole in the vessel, they too are considered joined, according to Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri].",
            "The baskets of a pack saddle, a threshing couch, the corner of a coffin, travelers' [water] horns, a key chain, the stitches of launderers [who would stitch together pieces of clothing for washing, to prevent them from separating], and a piece of clothing sown together with Kilayim, [these are all considered] joined for impurity, but not joined for sprinkling. ",
            "The cover of a kettle which is connected to a chain,  Beit Shammai say: it is joined for impurity but not for sprinkling; Beit Hillel say: if he sprinkles onto the kettle he has sprinkled on the cover [i.e. the cover also becomes pure], but if he sprinkles on the cover, he has not sprinkled on the kettle.  Anyone is valid to sprinkle, except for a <i>tumtum</i> [person (or animal) with recessed sexual organs whose gender is therefore impossible to determine, presently, by external examination. It is halachically uncertain whether such is male or female], an <i>androginos</i> [person (or animal) with both male and female sexual organs. It is halachically uncertain whether such is male, female or, perhaps, has a uniquely defined halachic gender], a woman, and a child that does not possess understanding.  A woman may assist in the sprinkling, and she can hold the water while he dips and sprinkles. If she held his hand [during the process], even at the time of sprinkling [and not just the dipping], it is invalid. ",
            "If one dipped the hyssop by day and sprinkled by day, it is valid. By day and sprinkled by night, [or] by night and sprinkled by day, it is invalid. But he himself can immerse at night and sprinkle by day, for we do not sprinkle until the sunrise. And anything done from dawn onward is valid. "
