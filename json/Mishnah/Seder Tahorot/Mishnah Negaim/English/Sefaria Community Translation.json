The Sages say, <i>Se'et</i> is like white wool, its subsidiary is like the membrane of an egg.",

            "These four appearances [of <i>Negaim</i>] combine, one with the other, to exempt [one from impurity], to decide [that one is impure], or to quarantine [one of uncertain status]. [They combine] to quarantine that which remains [unchanged] at the end of the first week [from reporting the <i>Nega</i>]. [They combine] to exempt that which remains [unchanged] at the end of the second week. [They combine] to decide that which develops healthy skin [in the area of the <i>Nega</i>] or white hair, [whether] initially, at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, [or] after the exemption. [They combine] to decide that which develops spreading, [whether] at the end of the first week, at the end of the second week, [or] after the exemption. [They combine] to decide that which turns completely white, [coming] from [the state of] exemption. [They combine] to exempt one who turns completely white, [coming] from [the state of] the decision [that he was impure] or from quarantine.

And not on the second day [of the week] because then [the end of] his second week will fall on Shabbat. And not on the third day [of the week] for the case of [the <i>Nega</i> afflicting] houses, because then [the end of] its third week will fall on Shabbat. Rabbi Akiva says: One always examines.

(Leviticus 14:35) \"The one who owns the house comes and tells the priest saying, Something like a <i>Nega</i> has appeared in my house.\" Even a learned person who knows that it is definitely a <i>Nega</i>, cannot declare and say, \"a <i>Nega</i> has appeared in my house,\" but rather he must say, \"Something like a <i>Nega</i> has appeared in my house.\" (Leviticus 14:36) \"The priest commands the house to be emptied (before the priest comes to see the house so that everything in the house will not become impure and then the priest comes to examine the house\"). Even bundles of wood and bundles of reeds, says Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says is he being kept busy emptying out his house? Rabbi Meir says, What of his property becomes impure? If you want to say his wooden utensils, his clothing, and his metal objects, he can immerse them and they will become pure. For which items was the Torah concerned? For his earthenware vessels, his small jugs and his oil dropper. If the Torah was so concerned for his less valuable objects, how much more so for his valuable objects. If so for his money, how much more so for the lives of his sons and daughters. If so for what belongs to a wicked person, how much more so for what belongs to a righteous person.",

Rather he stands next to the entrance of the house with the <i>Nega</i> in it and quarantines it, as it says \"The priest goes out of the house to the entrance of the house and quarantines the house for seven days\" (Leviticus 14:38). He comes at the end of the week and examines if it spread. \"The priest commands and they remove the stones that have the <i>Nega</i> on them and they send them to the outside of the city to an impure place\" (Leviticus 14:42). \"And they take other stones and bring them in place of the removed stones and he takes different dirt and plasters the house\" (Leviticus 14:42). He does not take stones from one side of it to put in the other side of it nor dirt from one side to place in another side and not lime from any place. He does not bring one in place of two [stones] nor two in place of one, but he can bring two in place of two, in place of three, or in place of four. From here they said, Woe to the evil person, woe to his neighbor. Both remove [the stones], both scrape [around them] and both bring the [new] stones. However, he alone must bring the [new] dirt as it says, \"he takes different dirt and plasters the house.\" His friend does not help with the plastering.",

            "There are ten [cases] of houses. If it dulls during the first [week] or goes away, he scrapes it off and it is pure. If it dulls during the second [week] or goes away, he scrapes it off and it requires [sacrificial] birds. If it spreads in the first [week], he removes, scrapes and plasters and gives it a week. If it returns, [the house] must be destroyed. If it does not return, it requires birds. If it stood [unchanged] after the first [week] and spread during the second [week], he removes, scrapes and plasters, and gives it a week. If it returned, the house must be destroyed. If it does not return, it requires birds. If it stood [unchanged] after this [first] and this [second week], he removes, scrapes, and plasters, and gives it a week. If it returns, the house must be destroyed. If it does not return, it requires birds. If before he purified it with birds the <i>Nega</i> [diseased patch on skin, clothes, or houses that creates impurity] reappeared, it must be destroyed. Once it has been purified with birds, if the <i>Nega</i> reappears, it should be examined as if in the beginning [of the <i>Nega</i>]. ",
            "A cornerstone, when he removes it, is removed in its entirety, but when he destroys [the house], he destroys what belongs to him but leaves what belongs to his neighbor. We find a stringency in the case of removal beyond that of demolition. Rabbi Elazar says, a house built with a cross-beam and a king-beam, if it appeared on the cross-beam he must remove it all, if it appeared on the king-beam, he removes what belongs to him but leaves what belongs to his neighbor.",

If it appeared in the attic, the beams are considered part of the house. If there was no attic on top of it, its stones, wood and dirt are destroyed with it, but it saves the frames and the window lattices. Rabbi Yehuda says the frame built on top of it is destroyed with it. Its stones, wood, and dirt, make it impure with [the size of] an olive. Rabbi Elazar Chisma says, in whatever size they are. ",
            "A quarantined house causes impurity from its inside, and a [house] designated [to be destroyed] from its inside and from its outside. Both this and that [types of house] make one impure by entering it.  ",
            "One who builds a pure house [with bricks] from a quarantined house, and the <i>Nega</i> returned to the house, he removes those stones. If it returned to the stones, the first house should be destroyed and the new stones should serve as indicators for the second house. ",
            "A house that extends over a house with a <i>Nega</i>, and similarly a tree that extends over a house with a <i>Nega</i>, one who enters the outer one is pure, says Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. Rabbi Elazar said, if one of its stones causes one to become impure by entering, should not [the whole house] itself make one impure by entering?!",

If a pure person is standing under a tree and an impure person passes [under the tree], he remains pure, but if he [the impure person] stood [under the tree], he would become impure. Similarly in the case of a stone with a <i>Nega</i>, [if it passes under] he remains pure, but if he laid it down, he would become impure. ",

An impure person who extends his head and most of his body into a pure house makes it [the house] impure.

If he was standing outside and extended his hand inside and his rings were in his hands, Rabbi Yehuda declares him impure immediately but the Sages say, until he remains long enough to eat half a loaf of bread. They said to Rabbi Yehuda, \"If when his entire body is impure, things that are on him only become impure if he remains long enough to eat half a loaf of bread, when his whole body is not impure should not what is on him certainly not become impure until he remains long enough to eat half a loaf?\"",

Anything that is saved by a seal in the tent of a dead person is saved by a seal in a house with a <i>Nega</i>. Whatever is saved by being covered in the tent of a dead person is saved by being covered in a house with a <i>Nega</i>, says Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yossi says, Anything that is saved by a seal in the tent of a dead person is saved by being covered in a house with a <i>Nega</i>. Whatever is saved by being covered in the tent of a dead person, even if it is uncovered in a house with a <i>Nega</i>, remains pure. "

            "How does one purify the leper? He would bring a new earthenware pitcher and place within it a <i>Revi'it</i> [specific unit of volume] of spring water and bring two wild birds. He slaughters one of them over the earthenware vessel and the spring water. He digs and buries it before him. He takes cedar wood, and hyssop and a red string and ties them together with the ends of the string. He surrounds them with the tips of the wings and the tip of the tail of the second one. He dips and sprinkles seven times on the back of the hand of the leper. Some say on his forehead. And so too would he sprinkle on the outer lintel of the house.",
            "He comes to him to send away the living bird, he does not face the sea nor the city nor the desert, as it says (Leviticus 14) \"He shall send away the living bird outside the city toward the field.\" He comes to shave the leper, he passes a razor over all of his body, washes his clothing, and immerses. He is pure in that he does not make [places] impure by entering, but he makes things impure like a vermin. He can enter within the wall, but he cannot enter his house for seven days and he is forbidden from sexual relations. ",
            "On the seventh day he shaves a second shaving like the first shaving, he washes his clothing and immerses. He is [now] pure in that he does not make things impure like a vermin, and is now [in terms of purity status] a <i>Tevul Yom</i> [someone who has immersed on that day]. He is permitted to eat tithes. Once the sun sets he can eat from <i>Terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a priest which becomes holy upon separation]. Once he brings his atonement [sacrifices] he can eat from holy things. It is found that there are three stages of purity by a leper and three stages of purity by one who gives birth. ",
            "Three people shave and their shaving is a commandment: The Nazirite, the leper, and Levites. All of them who shaved without a razor or who left two hairs have accomplished nothing. ",
            "The two birds, their commandment is that they be similar in appearance, height and value, and should be bought at the same time. Even if they are not the same they are [still] valid. If he bought one today and one tomorrow they are valid. If he slaughtered one of them and found that it was not wild, he should bring a partner for the second one. The first one is permitted to be eaten. If he slaughtered it and found it to be a <i>Terefah</i> [an animal with a mortal condition such that it would die within one year], he should bring a partner for the second one. The first is permitted in benefit. If the blood spilled, the one to be sent away must die. If the one to be sent away dies, the blood must be spilled out. ",
            "The commandment of the cedar wood is that its length should be one cubit and its width should be a quarter of the leg of a bed, cutting one piece to two and then those two to four. The commandment of the hyssop is that it should not be Greek hyssop or blue hyssop or Roman hyssop or desert hyssop or any type of hyssop which has an accompanying name.  ",
            "On the eighth day he brings three animals: A sin-offering, a guilt-offering, and a burnt-offering. A poor person brings the bird sin-offering and the bird burnt-offering. ",
            "He comes to the guilt-offering, and leans his two hands on it, slaughters it and two priests capture its blood, one in a vessel and one in his hand. The one who captures it in the vessel goes and throws it on the wall of the altar. The one who captures it in his hand goes to the leper.  The leper immerses in the chamber of the lepers. He then goes and stands in the Gate of Nikanor. Rabbi Yehuda says he does not require immersion. ",
            "He extends his head and [the priest] places the blood on the cartilage of his ear. [He then extends] his hand and he places the blood on the thumb of his hand. [He then extends] his food and he places the blood on the big toe of his foot. Rabbi Yehuda says he would extend all three at once. If he does not have the thumb of a hand, the big toe of a foot, or a right ear, he can never become pure.  Rabbi Eliezer says, he can place [the blood] on their places. Rabbi Shimon says if he put it on his left, it is valid. ",
            "He then takes from the <i>Log</i> [specific unit of volume] of oil and pours some on the palm of his friend [the other priest]. If he poured it into his own palm it is valid. He dips [his finger in the oil] and sprinkles seven times towards the Holy of Holies and before every sprinkling there was a dipping. He then came to the leper and wherever he placed the blood, there he places the oil, as it says (Leviticus 14) \"On the place of the blood of the guilt-offering. What remains from the oil in the palm of the priest he should place on the head of the person being purified to atone.\"  If he placed it he atones, if not he does not atone, says Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, they are the leftover of a commandment and regardless of whether he places it or he does not place it he atones but we consider him as if he did not atone. If part of the <i>Log</i> was deficient before he poured it, he must refill it, once he pours it out he must bring another as in the beginning, says Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon says, if the <i>Log</i> was deficient before he placed it he must refill it, once he placed it he must bring another as in the beginning. ",
            "A leper who brought his sacrifices while poor and then became rich, or while rich and then became poor, everything goes after the sin-offering, says Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says it goes after the guilt-offering. ",
            "A poor leper who brought the sacrifices of a rich man fulfilled his obligation, but a rich man who brought the sacrifices of a poor man did not fulfill his obligation. A man can bring for his son, his daughter, his slave, or his maidservant the offering of a poor person and then feed them from offerings. Rabbi Yehuda says even for his wife he can bring the offering of a rich person and so too for every offering she is obligated [to bring]. ",
            "If the offerings of two lepers became mixed up, if the offering of one of them was offered and the other one of them died, this is what the people of Alexandria asked Rabbi Yehoshua and he said to them, he should write all of his property to the other person and bring the offering of a poor person.
