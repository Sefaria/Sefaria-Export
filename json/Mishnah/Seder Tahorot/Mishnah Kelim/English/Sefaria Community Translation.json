            "The Origins of impurity: the <em>sheretz</em> [one of eight creeping creatures, whose identities are debated, and whose carcasses transmit ritual impurity upon contact], semen, that which is rendered impure by a dead body, the <em>metzora</em> [victim of a Divinely inflicted skin disease] while he is in his days of counting, a small amount of purifying water that is not enough to perform the sprinkling ceremony -  can render persons and vessels impure through touch, and pottery vessels through the air, but they do not render impure when they are carried.",
            "Higher than these: the <em>nevelah</em> [an animal which died without proper slaughter] and purifying water of which there is enough to perform the sprinkling ceremony, as they render impure a person through carrying and clothing through touch, and without clothes [on an unclothed area of a person], by touch.",
            "Higher than these: one who has intercourse with a <em>niddah</em> [a woman who is menstruating or has menstruated, but has not yet immersed], for he renders impure the bottom [layer] of what lies beneath him in like degree to the top. Higher than this: the abnormal genital discharge of a <em>zav</em> [man with an abnormal genital discharge], his spittle, his semen, and his urine, and the blood of the menstruant, for they convey impurity both by contact and by carrying. Higher than these: the impurity of a saddle, for it conveys impurity even to what lies beneath a heavy stone. Higher than a saddle: what one lies upon, since contact with it is equal to carrying it. Higher than what one lies upon: a <em>zav</em>; for a <em>zav</em> conveys impurity to what he lies upon, while what he lies upon does not convey the same level of impurity to that upon which it lies.",
            "Higher than the <em>zav</em> is the <em>zavah</em> [a woman with an abnormal genital discharge], for she conveys impurity to one who has intercourse with her. Higher than the <em>zavah</em>: the <em>metzora</em>, for he renders impure by entering. Higher than the <em>metzora</em>: bone the size of a barley grain, for it coneys seven-day impurity. More severe than all of these: a corpse, for it conveys impurity via overshadowing, which nothing else can do. ",
            "Ten degrees of impurity are derived from a person: the one whose atonement is incomplete [who has not brought a required sacrifice] is prohibited to eat <em>kodesh</em> [portions of offerings assigned to the priests], but permitted to eat <em>terumah</em> [portion of crops, wine, etc. required to be given to a priest] and <em>ma'aser</em> [tithes]. Should he become a <em>tevul yom</em> [immerses in the day and becomes pure upon nightfall], he is forbidden to eat <em>kodesh</em> and <em>terumah</em>,  but permitted to eat <em>ma'aser</em>. Should he have a nocturnal emission, he is prohibited in all three. Should he have intercourse with a <em>niddah</em>, he transmits impurity to the bottom layer lying beneath him as he does to the top. Should he become a <em>zav</em> and has seen two appearances [of discharge], he transmits impurity to the bed and the chair and needs to immerse in running water, but he is exempt from [bringing] an offering. If he sees a third [appearance], he is bound [to bring] an offering. Should he become a quarantined [suspected] <em>metzora</em>, he transmits impurity by entering [a house], but is exempt from loosening [hair], from tearing [of clothing], from shaving, and from the [offering of the] birds. But if he is declared a <em>metzora</em>, he is obligated in all of them. If a limb without enough flesh on it is separated from him, it transmits impurity through contact and through carrying, but it does not transmit impurity in a tent. And if there is enough flesh on it, then it transmits impurity through contact, and through carrying and in the tent. The measure of flesh that is sufficient is enough to bring up a scab. Rabbi Yehuda says, If there is enough [flesh] in one place to surround it with the thread of the woof, it is able to bring up a scab. ",
            "There are ten degrees of holiness. The land of Israel is holier than any other land. Wherein lies its holiness? In that from it are brought the <em>omer</em> [barley offering brought on the second day of Passover], the first fruits, and the two loaves [offered on Shavuot], which may not be brought from any other land.",
            "The walled cities are still more holy, in that they must send forth the <em>metzoraim</em> from their midst, and they may carry around a corpse therein as far as necessary, but once it is taken out, they may not bring it back.",
            "Inside the wall [of Jerusalem] is more holy than these, because there the less holy [offerings] and the second tithe are eaten. The Temple Mount has greater sanctity, because men and women with discharges, menstruating women, and women who have given birth may not enter there. The <i>Cheil</i> [a low fence around the Temple, which served as a boundary, beyond which entry to those impure was prohibited] has higher sanctity, because gentiles and people contaminated with corpse impurity may not enter there. The women's courtyard has higher sanctity, because a <em>tevul yom</em> may not enter there, but they are not liable for a sin offering for doing so. The Israelites' courtyard has higher sanctity, because one who lacks atonement may not enter there, and is liable for a sin offering for doing so. The priests' courtyard has higher sanctity, because the Israelites may not enter there except at the time of their [ritual] requirements: the laying on of hands, the slaughter, and the wave-offering. ",
            "Between the porch and the altar has still higher sanctity, because [priests] with blemishes and loosened hair may not enter there. The sanctuary has higher sanctity, because no one may enter there who has not washed their hands and feet. The holy of holies has greater sanctity than these, because no one may enter there except the High Priest on the Day of Atonement at the time of the service. Rabbi Yose said: In five ways [the area] between the porch and the altar is equal to the sanctuary because [priests] with blemishes, loosened hair, who have consumed wine, and who have not washed their hands and feet may not enter there, and they separate themselves from between the porch and the altar at the time of [the offering of the] incense.

            "Wooden vessels, leather vessels, bone vessels and glass vessels - their flat surfaces are pure and their concave surfaces are impure. If they break [and are impure], they become pure. If someone went back and made vessels from [the broken pieces], they can be rendered impure from then and onward. Clay vessels and lye vessels are equal in [the manner of their] impurity - they can be rendered and render [objects] impure in its interior space; and render impure by [contact] with its exterior, but do not become impure by [contact] from its outside; and their breaking [if they are impure] is their purification.",
            "The smaller clay vessels or their bottoms or their sides - [if they] sit upright without something to support them - their measurement [to be eligible for impurity] is enough [to store oil] to smear an infant. [This is in the case that these items only ever had the capacity of] up to a <i>log</i> (about a third of  liter); from a <i>log</i> to a <i>seah</i> (slightly over eight liters), [the measurement required for eligibility] is a <i>revi'it</i> (about 86 cubic centimeters); from one <i>seah</i> to two <i>seah</i>, half a <i>log</i>; from two <i>seah</i> to three [or even] to five <i>seah</i>, a <i>log</i> - these are the words of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says, \"I do not give them a measurement [to determine what is required for eligibility], but rather the smaller clay vessels or their bottoms or their sides - [if they] sit upright without something to support them - their measurement is enough to smear an infant. [This is in the case that these items were ever only] up to a small pot; from small pots to Lyddean barrels, [the measurement required] is a <i>revi'it</i>; from Lyddean [barrels] to Bethlehemite ones, half a <i>log</i>; from Bethlehemite ones to large vats, a <i>log</i>.\" Rabban Yochanan be Zakkai says, \"The measurement for large vats is two <i>log</i>.\" Gallilean jars and firkins - the [required measurement] of their bottoms is any bit, but they do not have sides [that can become impure by themselves].",

This is the general principle - every clay vessel that does not have an interior does not have an exterior [that can become impure].  ",
            "A lantern that has a receptacle for oil [can become] impure; and one that does not is pure. A mold of craftsmen - when he begins [his work] with it - it is pure; and when he finishes with it - it [can become] impure. A funnel of homeowners is pure; and of peddlers [can become] impure, because it is [used] for measurement. These are the words of Rabbi Yehuda ben Betira. Rabbi Akiva says, \"Because he leans it on its side and has the customer smell from it.\" ",
            "The covers of wine jugs and oil jugs and covers of Nurean barrels are pure. But if they are made fit for usage [in their own right], they [can become] impure. A pan cover - when it is perforated or [its back] is pointed - is pure. If it is not perforated and does not have a pointed [back], it [can become] impure, because [a woman] strains the vegetable into it. Rabbi Eliezer bar Tsadok says, \"Because she flips the vegetable concentrate onto it.\"  ",

A <i>titros</i> (a particular type of perforated vessel) - Rabbi Eliezer bar Tsadok determines it to be pure; Rabbi Yose determines it to be [able to become] impure because it releases [slowly].",
            "The impure ones (that can be rendered impure) among clay vessels are: a tray with a rim; a full (unsplit) poker; a tray full of pans (connected to it). If one of [the pans] is rendered impure by a crawling creature (<i>sherets</i>), not all of them became impure. If there is surplus to the lid (above the tops of the pans), if one of them became impure, they all became impure. And so [too] a spice-tray of clay and quillsets. And a spice-tray of wood in which one [compartment] became impure from a liquid, its fellow did not become impure. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says, \"We divide its thickness - that [part] which serves the pure is pure and that which serves the impure is impure. If there is a surplus rim - if one [compartment] becomes impure, its fellow becomes impure. ",

Concerning a jug [for oil or wine], its measure is with water. Rabbi Shimon says, concerning these three, [their measure] is with seeds. Concerning a lamp, its measure is with oil. R. Eliezer says \"with a small perutah.\"  Concerning a lamp whose spout has been taken, it is clean. And one [made] of clay whose spout is burned by the wick, it is clean.   ",

Pitch that drops on a jar, whatever touches it is pure. A funnel [made of] wood or of clay which is plugged with pitch, Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah declares it subject to become impure.

A jug which lost a piece but can still contain with its sides, or became divided like two troughs - Rabbi Yehudah says it is pure, but the Sages say it is impure.  ",

If it had hollow knobs, if it can hold olives it can become impure by touching and can make things opposite it impure through the air. If it cannot hold olives it can become impure by touching but does not make things opposite it impure.  If it was laying on its side like a <em>katedrah</em> chair - if it can hold olives, it can become impure by touching and can make things opposite it impure through the air; if it cannot hold olives, it can become impure by touching but does not make things opposite it impure through the air. The bottom of a pointed vessel and the bottom of Sidonian cups, even though they cannot rest without support, they are impure because they were made this way. ",

If the middle one extends, from it to the inside is impure, and from it to the outside is pure.  If they were all even, Rabbi Yehudah says the middle one is divided, but the Sages say the entire vessel is pure. When does an earthenware vessel become susceptible to impurity? When it is fired in the kiln, and this completes its work. "

The Sages say, this is only true regarding a large oven; regarding a small oven, however, it beginning [point] is any [size] and its remainder is a majority [of its size] once its manufacture has been completed. What is the completion of its manufacture? Once it is kindled enough to bake a sponge cake in it. Rabbi Yehudah says, once it is kindled enough to bake a sponge cake [as] in an old oven.",

What is the completion of its manufacture? When it is kindled enough to cook the easiest-cooking of eggs on it, scrambled and placed in a pot. A <em>kupach</em> [small stove or brazier] that is made to bake has the same measurement requirements as an oven. If it was made to cook, its measurement requirements are that of a stove. A stone that protrudes a <em>tefach</em> from the oven or a distance of three fingers from a stove is connected. If it protrudes from a <em>kupach</em> made for baking, the measurement is that of the oven. If from a <em>kupach</em> made to cook, its measurement is that of a stove.

Less than this, it is pure. If it is attached [to the oven], even if on three stones, it is impure. The holder for an oil jug, the holder for a spicebox or the holder of a light on a stove, become impure through [an impure object's] contact [with the stove] but are not impure through its air[space].

There was a story that a fire fell on the ovens of Kfar Signa, and the story came to Yavneh, and Raban Gamliel ruled them susceptible to impurity.",
            "The extension on a householder's oven [a thick rim on top] is pure. But that of a baker's oven is impure because he rests a spit on it. Rabbi Yochanan Hasandlar says: [It is impure] because he bakes with it [by placing dough on the inside of the rim] when he is pressured. Similarly, the extension of an olive cooker's cauldron is impure. But that of a dyer's cauldron is pure.",

Rabbi Shimon says: it must be moved [from its position]. If it is divided into two parts, one large and the other small, the larger remains impure and the smaller becomes pure. If it is divided into three parts one of which was as big as the other two together, the big one remains impure and the two small ones become pure. ",

It must be big enough for the flame to come through.  The same applies also to a stove: a stove of stone or of metal is not subject to impurity [according to the laws for a stove]. But [the metal one] is subject to impurity as a metal vessel. If a hole was made in it or if it was damaged or cracked but he made props for it, it is impure.

And similarly he used to say concerning the stopper of a jar which was pierced: The minimum size is the circumference of the second knot in a rye stalk. If the hole was in the middle the stalk must be able to enter, and if at the side it need not be able to enter. And similarly he used to say concerning large stone jars whose stoppers became pierced. The minimum size is the circumference of the second knot in a reed. If the hole was in the middle the reed must be able to enter it, and if it was at the side the reed need not be able to enter it. When is this so? When the jars were made for wine, but if they were made for other liquids, if they have even the smallest hole, they are impure. When is this so? When the holes were not made by a person, but if they were made by a person, if they have even the smallest hole, they are impure.

If one removed a thread from its initial portion and then afterwards completed the whole garment upon it, it is pure; for They said: a [piece of cloth of] three by three [fingerbreadths] which was diminished is pure.

How much salt must it be capable of storing? A <i> rova</i> [a specific unit of volume, a quarter of a <i>kav</i>]. Rabbi Yehudah says: this is with regard to fine salt. And the Sages say: it is with regard to coarse salt.  Both of their intentions were to rule leniently.

Regarding a [piece of cloth of] three by three [fingerbreadths], if one of its threads was worn away, or if a knot was found in it, or if two of its threads ran alongside each other [i.e. as an imperfection in its weave], it is pure. A [piece of cloth of] three by three [fingerbreadths] which was cast to the trash heap is pure. If one brought it back [from the trash], it is [once more susceptible to being rendered] impure. Its having been thrown away always renders it pure, and its being brought back renders it [susceptible to becoming] impure, except when it is of purple or fine crimson [which can still be rendered impure even after being cast into the trash].
