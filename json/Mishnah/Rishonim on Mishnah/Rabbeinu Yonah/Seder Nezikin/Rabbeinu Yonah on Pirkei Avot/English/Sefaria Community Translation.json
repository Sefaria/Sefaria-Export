                "<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai, etc.:</b> (I will begin the commentary on \"Avot\" of our great, pious and holy rabbi, Rabbi Yonah the son of Rabbi Avraham, may he be remembered for blessing.) Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 30a) \"One who wishes to be pious should fulfill the words of Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), and [some] said about it, the words of Damages (Nezikin)\". And since a person ascends the steps of piousness by doing one of these matters, they placed [Avot] in the Order of Damages. And even though they also said to fulfill the words of Blessings (Berakhot) which is in the order of Seeds (Zeraim); because it speaks of the blessings on seeds and fruits, they placed it in that order (Editor's note: See what Midrash Shmuel wrote about this in the name of Rabbi Yosef Nachmias, may his memory be blessed). Furthermore, since it is the teachings of the Sanhedrin, they placed it in the order of the laws (of Damages); and so [too], all the sages mentioned [here] until Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai are all from the Sanhedrin. ",
                "<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> Both the written Torah and the oral Torah. As the Torah was given with its explanation. As if it were not so, it would be impossible to understand [its contents]. As behold, it is written (Leviticus 19:13), \"do not rob\" - and all of the [laws of] damages are within this negative commandment, and they themselves are the Torah that was received by Moshe at Sinai, even though they were not written. And it is also written (Deuteronomy 17:8), \"between a blood and a blood and between a judgement and a judgement and between an infection and an infection\" - and many of the sightings of blood and many of the various judgments and so many of the infections are known to us by the transmission [of this information]... And they are not explained [in writing] because it is not allowed to be written. And it is written (Exodus 24:12), \"and I will give you the stone tablets and the Torah and the commandment\" - \"Torah\" is the written Torah; \"and the commandment\" is the oral Torah. it comes out that you say that every commandment that He gave to Moshe at Sinai, was given with its explanation. And that which is written is what is called the written Torah and the explanation is what is called the oral Torah. And Moshe learned it from the mouth of the Mighty One.  ",
                "<b>and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> As it is stated (Exodus 33:11), \" but his attendant, Joshua son of Nun, a youth, would not stir out of the tent.\"",
                "<b>and Yehoshua to the Elders:</b> As it is stated (Joshua 24:31), and all the days of the elders who had length of days after Joshua.\"",
                "<b>and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly:</b> And that is Ezra and his group. And [some of] the prophets of the Second Temple were in that group, as they said in Yevamot 16a, \"Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said, 'When Chaggai said these three things, he was sitting on this mortar.'\" Hence the prophets of the Second Temple were there after the destruction, since Haggai the prophet was there. And the men of the Great Assembly transmitted it to the men of their generation. And the sages [transmitted it] to their children after them in each and every generation. And the transmission was from one sage to another, until all of the sages of Israel gathered and a suggestion was given from all of their mouths to write down the oral Torah. And [so] they wrote and sealed the Talmud, and afterwards nothing was added to it and nothing was taken away from it. And that generation also transmitted it to the Geonim and the transmission was from one Gaon to another, one rabbi to another - until this day. ",
                "<b>They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment:</b> They said [this] to teachers of legal decisions and decisors of legal decisions and decisors of litigation; that they should not rely on the first thought, but rather upon great deliberation and incisive investigation, so that they not err in their evaluation. As a man who is quick to make a decision is called a sinner - and even though he thought he was saying the truth, it is not [considered] accidental but rather is [considered] to be close to volitional, since he did not put it into his heart to say, the quick hearts do not understand to know. As error is found in all men, as the rabbis say (Avot 4:13), \" Be careful in study, for an error in study is considered an intentional transgression.\" And about this matter, Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 26:12), \"If you see a man who thinks himself wise, there is more hope for a dullard than for him.\" And it is as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Avot 4:7), \"One who is nonchalant about giving legal decisions is an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit.\" Therefore, it is incumbent upon a man who makes legal decisions to go back and forth on the matter and let his thought ripen and to hold on to it; as the matter that they said (Sanhedrin 35a) [that] we should ripen a judgement, as through ripening and deliberation, he adds reasoning to his reasoning and sharpness to his sharpness, until he judges a completely true judgement. As he will see to say with the second thought that which he did not see with the first. And about this matter, Asaf stated (Psalms 73:21), \"As my heart ripened and my kidneys were silent,\" which is to say [that] after my heart has ripened and been sharp with wisdom and with my kidneys, I have been silent and have refined my understanding to know. As without this, I have not known, and this is my portion. (And as) it is after it, \"I was a dolt, without knowledge; I was brutish toward You.\" And the reason [they] said, <b>\"Be deliberate in judgment,\"</b> is in order to warn about litigation more than other legal decisions, as they are fundamental in the knowledge of Him, may He be blessed and elevated; and as Yirmiyahu the prophet stated (Jeremiah 9:23), \"ponder and know Me, for I am the Lord who makes kindness, justice, and equity in the world; for in these I delight, declares the  Lord.\" And how can a man a ponder and know God, as it is not possible? However with this have we known Him, by dong judgment and justice, since God does these. And that is what is stated (Jeremiah 22:16), \"He judged for the poor and needy— then all was well. That is truly knowing Me, declares the  Lord.\" And it is written in another place (Micah 6:8), \"And what does the Lord require of you? Only to do justice and to love kindness,\" since judgments are a pillar of the Torah. And from them the world is made firm, as is said in the Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 30 3), \"It is written in front of The Ten Commandments, 'and they will judge the people at all times' (Exodus 18:22). And after the Ten Commandment, it is written, 'And these are the laws' (Exodus 21 1). There is a parable [about this] concerning a matron that was walking along the way and her armed guards were walking in front of her and behind her.\"",
                "<b>raise up many disciples:</b> As per the opinion of Beit Hillel. [This is] like the matter that we have learned (The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan 2:9), \"Beit Shammai say, 'We only teach a student who is fit, modest, proper and who fears Heaven, as it is stated (Job 20:26), \"All (darkness) waits for his treasured ones.\" And Beit Hillel say, 'We teach everyone: One hundred so that ten good ones will come out from them; and ten so that two will come out of them; and two, \"since you do not know which will be proper, this one or that one or if they will both be equally good.\" And so was there a story of Hillel, who brought together all of his students and said to them, 'Are all of you here?' They said [back] to him, 'Yes.' One of his students said to him, 'All of them are here except the smallest one.' He said to them, 'Let the small one come, for the future generation will be conducted by him .' And they brought Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai. Behold that one should not push off the small ones for the bigger ones, since the kids will become goats.\" And about this matter the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Yevamot 62b), \"'Sow your seed in the morning, and don’t hold back your hand in the evening' (Ecclesiastes 11:6), - if you have raised disciples in your youth, raise disciples in your old age.\" Behold that the multiplication of disciples is a very good thing and a merit to the teacher.",
                "<b>and make a fence for the Torah:</b> As the matter that is stated (Leviticus 18:30), \"And you shall guard My guarding\"; which is to say, make a guarding for my guarding. And a fence is a great thing and it is praiseworthy to make a fence for the commandments so that the one who fears the word of God not stumble in them. Hence one who observes the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed - which are the fences for the commandments of the Torah - has shown more love for [this] fear than one who does the commandment itself. As the doing of the commandments does not prove fear like the one who observes the fences, since he is careful from the start not to come to error. However, the one who does the commandment but does not observe the fence shows us that if it is good in his eyes to do the commandment, [yet] it is not bad in his eyes if he errs in it; and that he is not concerned about the fear that he will make a breach in it, and 'one who makes a breach will be bitten by a snake.' Behold that the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed, are pillars and 'trees' in the fear of Heaven; which is a foundation of the world and a fundamental principle of virtue. And all of the commandments are appetizers for it, as they said in the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1), \"'For your love is more delightful than wine' (Song of Songs 1:2) - the words of the scribes are more beloved than the wine of Torah.\""

                "<b>Shimon the Righteous was from the remnants of the Great Assembly.</b> And he was a high priest, as they said in Tractate Tamid 21 (Yoma 69a) that he had gone out dressed with the priestly garments in front of Alexander [the Great] and [Alexander] went down and bowed before him. His servants said to him, \"Our master, A king like you should bow down to this Jew?\" He said [back] to them, \"I see the image of this one in war and I am victorious.\"",
                "<b>He would say, \"On three things the world stands\":</b> This means to say that because of these things the world was created. As below (Avot 1:18), it states, \"On three the things the world subsists,\" and they are not those that it mentions here. Hence, we need to explain that when they said \"stands,\" it means that the world was created for them, since they are the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. This means to say that the world was created for His creatures that in the future would fulfill His will in front of Him through these things. And these three are a great pillar, such that on account of them, we are able to get to all of the [other] things that the sages, may their memory be blessed, said that the world stands because of them.",
                "<b>\"On the Torah\":</b> As it stated about it (as it is stated) (Proverbs 11:27), \"He who seeks what is good pursues what is pleasing.\" And good is only Torah, and because of it the world was created, as it is stated (Jeremiah 33:25), \"Were it not for My covenant, night and day[, etc.]. And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, said, (Proverbs 8:22), \"The Lord created me at the beginning of His course, as the first of His works of old\" - I was created before the whole world and because of me, all of the creations were created - in order to observe me. ",
                "<b>\"on the service\":</b> As the Holy One, blessed be He, chose Israel from all of the nations and the Land of Israel from all of the lands, and He chose Jerusalem from all of the Land of Israel and He chose Zion from Jerusalem, as it is stated (Psalms 132:13), \"As the Lord chose Zion, He desired it for His habitation.\" And He chose the House of Choice from everything for the sake of the service, about which it is written, \"desire\" - as it states (Leviticus 1:3), \"desirous in front of God.\" Behold that because of the service the whole world was created. Then, due to our sins, the Temple was destroyed and the service was annulled. And prayer is now for us in its place, as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Taanit 2a), \"'And to serve him with all your hearts' (Deuteronomy 11:13) - what service is there in the heart, one should say this is prayer.\" And this is what it states (Psalms 51:17), \"Lord, open my lips,\" as King David said this verse about the sin of Batsheva which was volitional, and one cannot bring a sacrifice for volitional sins. And about this he stated (Psalms 51:18), \"Since You do not want me to bring sacrifices; You do not desire burnt offerings.\" Had I been able to bring a sacrifice to atone for myself, I would have brought [it]. Now that I cannot, 'Lord, open my lips and let my mouth say your praise,' and accept my prayer in place of a sacrifice and let it atone me for my sin. Also for us that do not have a sacrifice to atone for us - not accidental sins and not volitional sins - 'Lord, open my lips' and accept our prayers in place of the sacrifices.  ",
                "<b>\"and on acts of lovingkindness\"</b> As the matter that they said (Sukkah 49b), \"Acts of lovingkindness are greater than charity (<i>tsedekah</i>); since lovingkindness is both with the poor and with the wealthy but charity is only with the poor. Great is lovingkindness since it is both with one's body and with one's money, but charity is only with one's money.\"  And this is what they said, (Bava Batra 9a), \"One who gives a small coin to a poor man is blessed in six ways and one who comforts him with words is blessed in eleven.\" And pertinent to acts of lovingkindness is to inspect the poor and to make a distinction between the good and the bad and to give preference to the modest and those that fear God over others who are not like them (even if we must give charity to all). And it is like Yirmiyahu, peace be upon him, stated (Jeremiah 18:23), \"let them be made to stumble before You; act against them in Your hour of wrath!\" - even in the time that they do charity, make them stumble that they should give it in the incorrect place. And acts of lovingkindness are even to the wealthy, to lend them money at a time when it is not found in their hand and to give them advice, as King Shlomo said, (Proverbs 27:9), \"Oil and incense gladden the heart, but the sweetness of a friend is better than one’s own counsel.\" [This] is to say, just like oil and incense gladden the heart, so [too] does one 's friend become delighted by personal advice; and when he gives him good advice, he is gladdened by it. And this trait of kindness brings God's satisfaction in front of Him, and for it was the world created - in order to do it. And about it Shlomo said in his wisdom (Proverbs 14:34), \"Righteousness exalts a nation; Sin is a reproach to any people\" - and adjacent to it, \"The king favors a capable servant\" - the will of the Holy One, blessed be He is only for Israel, who investigate [how] to do the things that are desirable in front of Him."

But rather the [correct] textual variant is \"not in order to receive a reward\" - that he should not do the commandments for the sake of the reward, even though he should think that there will be recompense for his service. However, it appears to me that the variant of the books is the main one [that we should follow]: As we find such service among people, such that a purchased slave is obligated to do service without receiving reward. So too, a man must serve God in order not to receive a reward, but rather because of the kindness that He has already performed for him. And also due to the greatness of the Master, that He is fitting for this, and this is the service of God - may He be blessed and elevated - from love, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:5), \"And you shall love the Lord.\" And what is complete service among people? One who wants to serve his friend because of his love for him from earlier days, and even if he knows that he will not give him a reward. And [with] this type of love should a person love the service of God. And therefore, [the Mishnah] placed it adjacent to the matter of fear and stated,",

As if they said it with the one that will be permissible for him tomorrow - and it appears to him like 'bread in his basket' - all the more so with another woman, whom the impulse desires, as the matter that it stated (Proverbs 9:17), \"stolen waters are sweet.\" But it appears to be explained according to its simple meaning, \"They so stated with his wife,\" not to ever accustom her to [many] words, so that she not be found with him every day. As a man should not be with his wife for his pleasure, but [rather] to fulfill the commandment; so as to distinguish between man and beast, as they said in Tractate Berakhot 22a concerning a man with a nocturnal emission, \"So that they not be with their wives like chickens.\" And that is the trait of separation which brings one to the highest levels, as we say (Avodah Zarah 20b), \"Separation brings to purity.\"",

And this is what Shlomo - peace be upon him - stated (Ecclesiastes 7:26), \"I find woman more bitter than death; she is all traps, her heart is snares and her hands are fetters.\" This means to say that death removes him from the world - from the small life of the world - but woman destroys his soul for ever and ever. Behold, 'she is more bitter than death.' \"She is all traps and snares\": When a man observes a woman, he is caught in her net, which is her trap, and he cannot escape from her.

As even if his friend is not more pious than he and there are times that he does what is not in order. [Yet it is only] when he derives pleasure from something that he does the sin, but it is not his desire and his will that his friend do it - as he derives no enjoyment from this. And it is like they said (Kiddushin 63b), \"And a man will not sin if it is not for himself.\" It comes out that both of them will repent, each one according to the word of his friend. And the third is regarding advice that he can take, that he be 'one who arouses (a counselor) for help' in all of his affairs and to take good counsel from him and to be his confidant. Since he is his ally, he will not reveal [his secrets] to others so as not to confound his plan - and not even to those that appear to him to be friends; for is the appearance of love evident on their faces? And about this Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 15:22), \"Plans are foiled for want of counsel, but they succeed through many advisers.\" And that which he said, <b>\"acquire for yourself a friend\"</b> with an expression of [acquisition] (euphemism) is [to say] that if he does not find him for free, he should acquire him with his money and expend his assets in order to get to a good friend; or that he should acquire him with words of appeasement and with a soft way of talking. And [so] he should not be exacting about his words and he should tolerate the words of his mouth; even when he says something against him, he should not return a response.

And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 17:9), \"He who seeks love covers errors, but he who harps on a matter alienates a leader.\" He meant to say, one who covers when his friend errs, seeks love - as through this, their love is preserved, as he tolerates his errors. But if he harps about the matter with his friend, he speaks against him and repeats it and says, \"See what this one said; what he said about me, he 'alienates the leader' - he(certainly) alienates his leader from him, meaning to say, his friend.

As with the righteous person, even with an action that is completely evil and leans toward guilt in every aspect, we should judge him favorably and say, \"'It was a mistake that came out from the hand of the ruler,' and behold he regretted and observed [it] and [already] requested forgiveness.\" And it is like the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 19a), \"If you see a Torah scholar who sinned at night, do not ruminate about him during the day, lest he has repented.

Even if his actions are completely good and it is not evident to be concerned about him regarding an angle of iniquity, a person should judge him unfavorably and say, \"He did it on the surface 'and his inside is not like his outside.'\" And it is like it is stated (Proverbs 26:25), \"Though he be fair-spoken do not trust him, for seven abominations are in his heart.\" And so [too] wrote Rambam, may his memory be blessed. And about this Shlomo stated in his wisdom (Proverbs 21:12), \"The righteous one observes the house of the wicked man; he subverts the wicked to the bad.\" He meant to say, people think that because the righteous do not know how to do evil, [hence] they do not recognize they ways of the evil - as they do not understand those that do it. And the matter is not like this, as 'the righteous one observes the house of the wicked,' and knows and recognizes and monitors the evil of his ways more than other people who know [about it], but don't pay attention to it. \"He subverts the wicked to the bad\" - when the righteous person sees the action of the evildoers which appear to be in a good path, he subverts it and pushes it towards his judgment to say that he has done wrong - since he did not intend [to do] a commandment, but rather to place himself among those assumed to be good.

For this, it shall be upon you.' \"As his time comes suddenly\" and you will not be able to escape for your life. \"And the doom of both, who can foreknow,\" meaning to say, the doom of the king's hater and the doom of the hater of the Holy One, blessed be He.

Whichever [path] that is [itself] praiseworthy for the person adopting [it], And praiseworthy to him from [other] people:</b> When the commandments are done, the Holy One, blessed be He, is made praiseworthy through them and that is true praiseworthiness for people. And therefore, one should choose this path for himself.",
                "<b>And praiseworthy to him from [other] people:</b> That he do the commandments in their [appropriate] time, as it is stated (Proverbs 15:23), \"and how good is a thing in its time.\" As he can do [them] in a time that is not right in the eyes of the creatures and it will not attain praiseworthiness from them. And that is not doing the complete commandment; as the matter that the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 63a), \"Anyone who does a commandment according to its statement nullifies even a decreed judgment of seventy years, as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 8:4), 'Inasmuch as a king’s command is authoritative, and none can say to him, “What are you doing?,” and it is written after it, 'One who obeys the commandment will not know evil.'\" He should also beautify the commandments - a beautiful lulav (palm frond), a beautiful talit (prayer shawl), a beautiful scroll of the Torah, tefillin and the like, in a manner that people will praise it and complement him about them. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, explained this mishnah [to be] about character traits, to [follow] the middle path which is the choice path and is praiseworthy for the one that adopts it. As it establishes 'a pure heart' in a person and 'renews a proper spirit in his soul.' And \"it is praiseworthy to him from [other] people,\" in that the creations learn to act well and properly from him. [For example] with the trait of generosity, 'A miser will not be called noble,' and also a spendthrift will see evil. And [so] who is the generous one? One who - even though he loves money and saves it very well - consults generously and orders his spending so that he will have enough 'to do the good and the straight' in the place that is fitting to give to. So [too] there is no trait under the [sun] that [is proper] except besides the middle path. And [these traits] are praiseworthy for the person adopting it, and praiseworthy to him from [other] people (but [not] if he does [too] little or [too] much).",
                "<b>And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one, for you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments:</b> Even though the punishments for sins are explained to us - as some of them are with excision (<i> karet</i>) and some with death at the hands of Heaven, excision being that he and his seed are cut off whereas death at the hands of Heaven is only that he is cut off, and there are some sins that get the four death penalties meted out by the court, and there are negative commandments that bring forty lashes, and the one who transgresses the rabbinic laws gets rabbinic lashes for rebellion - but the reward of the [positive] commandments is not explained to us, not for the light ones and not for the weighty ones. And the sages, may their memory be blessed, demonstrated [this with] a parable (Pesikta Rabbati 23), \"To what is this similar? To a king who gave an orchard for his servants in which to plant trees. And if he made known to them the giving of reward [of the different trees], they would have all toiled on those trees that have a large reward, and it would come out that the orchard would be missing the other [trees]. So [too], were the Holy One, blessed be He, to make known the giving of reward for the [different] commandments, [people] would do the weighty ones that have a large reward and leave over the light ones that have a smaller reward, and a person would be incomplete in the commandments.\" And for this reason, one should not be lenient about the commandments, and his soul should hold them [all] dear to do, since he does not know which are the light ones and which are the weighty ones. But our rabbi (R. Yehuda HaNassi, the author of this mishnah) excelled in his words and gave a stronger reason than this and said that \"you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments\" [as to] how much it is - as even the reward of a light commandment is highly elevated. And you should be careful not to lose such a great gain, like the matter that they said (Chullin 142a), \"'If you chance upon the nest of a bird in front of you, etc.' (Deuteronomy 22:6) - and if for a commandment as light as a small coin the Torah says, 'in order that it will be good for you' in the world that is completely good 'and that you will have length of days' in the world that is completely long, all the more is it so for the weighty commandments of the Torah.\"",

And it is a wonder why he counted them as three things, as the three of them are [really] one thing. As this is [all] just saying that God knows everything and will pay back in the future according to the deed. And [so] what is this calculation, as they are all one matter? Hence, it appears that the explanation is that this matter is a metaphor: that in the same way that when he is standing in front of kings and in front of ministers and sages and men of repute, he would be embarrassed to do things that are not done and from saying things that are not good; so [too] should he think at all times as if he is in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, in the same way as a man stands in front of his companion. And with this, he will guard his way - also his mouth and his tongue - from sinning, and 'from anguish to his soul.'  And that is why he said, \"Know what is above you: An Eye that sees, and an Ear that hears,\" and counted them as two things - an Eye that sees corresponding to the deed and an Ear that hears corresponding to the speech. And God forbid - it is not a real eye nor a [real] ear. But rather, he means to say that there is no deed that is hidden from in front of Him nor one that is unknown to Him. And the third thing is \"and all your deeds are written in a book\" - meaning to say that there is no forgetting in front of His throne of glory. And behold, all things are ordered in front of Him, as if they were written in a book, to pay their doers according to their actions and according to the deeds of their hands in the end of days.

And the correct [reason that the question was asked] is because there are several good traits the opposite of which are not bad;  like the trait of piety which is a very great virtue - but if one is not pious, no bad will happen.

Yet it will be lacking in his heart at the end of days - as the little that is lacking will be a big lack, as Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated in his wisdom (Ecclesiastes 10:1), \"Dead flies turn the perfumer’s ointment fetid and putrid; so a little folly outweighs massive wisdom.\" He meant to say [that] just like a fly - which is a small thing - completely destroys a very important thing, the perfumer's ointment; so too is a little foolishness to the glory of a sage and an honored man. As the trait of miserliness causes a man to be empty (<i>beliaal</i>) of the good traits.

And this is what it says here, \"is like borrowing from the Omnipresent\" - meaning to say that he not think that since I don't have with what to pay and I was already brought to court and they did not find anything for me to pawn and I left innocent, what is my transgression and what is my sin? And the matter to you is as if you borrowed from the Omnipresent, blessed be He; and if you are exempt from the laws of man, you are nonetheless not [exempt] from the laws of Heaven. And you will not be exempt on account of people [as] the case will be between you and God. Since when you have a case for a loan with people, you are not exempt - even if people have exempted you. What is the reason? As it is stated (Psalms 37:21), \"The evildoer borrows and does not repay; the righteous has compassion and gives\" - meaning to say, that since he borrowed and does not repay, he is an evildoer. And [this is so] even though he doesn't have [with what to pay], as it was up to him to investigate with what he would repay from the beginning. But the righteous one is compassionate and gives what he has to give, giving it [so that he can still] repay. Since he is nonetheless careful from the beginning with that with which he can repay. And even though we do not hold it as a credit for the man who repays his obligation; for the righteous one who has 'grace on his lips' in his way in the world, we hold it as a credit when he returns people's money and they become his friends on account of their money.

And through this, he will have every illness and ailment, and this is that which is stated (Proverbs 13:25), \"The righteous man eats to satisfaction, but the belly of the wicked is lacking.\" As the stomach is only able to digest what it can hold; and when one eats and fills it until the palate no [longer] desires to eat, he makes the belly lack and destroys it - as the destruction of the belly is its lack. But the righteous person who eats to the satisfaction of his soul and only to remove his hunger, he sustains the body which the soul loves [in order] 'to do the good and the straight in the eyes of the Lord.' And the enlightened ones will understand. How is it [with] sitting, getting up and walking? There is no need to say that 'he not sit in a gathering of scorners and not stand in a place of sinners and not walk in the counsel of evildoers,' [but] even to sit in the council of the straight and to stand in the path of the righteous and to walk in the path of the innocent - if he did it for his own benefit and to fulfill the wants of his body and its desires, it is not praiseworthy; but [rather] only if he did [it] for the sake of Heaven. How is it [with] laying down? There is no need to say that at a time that he can be involved in Torah [study] and in the commandments and [instead] arouses himself to sleep to enjoy himself, that it is not fit to do so. But even at a time when he is weary and needs to sleep in order to rest from his weariness - if he does it for the benefit of his body, it is not praiseworthy; but [rather] only if it is to fulfill the needs of his body in order that he be able to serve his Creator and to give sleep to his eyes and rest to his body, for the needs of health and that his mind not break down in Torah [study] from the weariness. With sexual relations, there is no need to say that he not commit a sin. But even at the appointed time stated in the Torah, if he does [it] for the sake of the benefit to his body or to achieve his desire - behold, this is disgraceful. But even if he intended [it] so that he have sons that will serve him and fill his place, it is not praiseworthy; but rather only if it is that he have sons to serve the Omnipresent, may He be blessed, or that he intended to have sexual relations to fulfill the appointed time stated in the Torah - like who one pays off a debt to his creditor. How is it [with] speaking? There is no need to say [not] to recount evil speech and foulness of the mouth and similar to them. But even in recounting words of wisdom, his intention needs to be for the service of his Creator or for something that will bring him to His service. The principle of the matter is that a person is obligated to put his eyes and his heart to his ways, and to weigh all of his deeds in the scales of his mind. And when he sees that something brings him to the service of his Creator, may He be blessed, he should do it; and if not, he should separate from it. And so wrote Rambam, may his memory be blessed."

Another explanation: When a person's fear of sin precedes his wisdom, it comes out that when he studied, it guarded him and strengthened him to go on the path that he is accustomed to from many days; since when he fears sin and his heart adds great love for it and desires to add to it, it strengthens him to do that to which he is accustomed.

If he doesn't know the Torah and the commandments; when he needs to do these actions, upon what [basis] will he do them? Rather this mishnah was speaking according to a fit, good and accepted advice for the one who doesn't know - so that he not destroy his soul. [That advice is] that he accept upon himself to do all of the things that the sages tell him to do, and not to veer from them to the right or to the left when he knows them.

And immediately when he accepts upon himself this acceptance with a full heart and a desiring soul, he brings [himself] reward, as if he [did] all of the commandments. And according to this approach, they said, \"Anyone whose actions are more plentiful than his wisdom,\" [as] even for the one who does not know and does not do, they are called actions - since he has reward for them as if he did them, on account of [his] acceptance.

However they accepted upon themselves first to do all that He would command them and [that] they would understand; and they received reward from it immediately as if they had done them. \"And anyone whose wisdom is more plentiful than his actions, etc.\" - that he should not say, \"I will study this law and [then] I will practice it, I will study the whole Talmud and [then] I will practice it.\" If he says like this, his wisdom will not endure - as one needs to perfect the traits first and then his wisdom will endure."

And he should not say, \"[I have] a thousand kor - how can I give a hundred to the tithe, and they are worth much.\" As God, may He be blessed and elevated, is trustworthy to pay him all that he gave and to multiply the reward.

And he distances himself from the roots of [the pleasures] and brings himself near to the fundamentals (literally, trunks) of the soul and its foundation. And [hence] he is close to the service of the Creator, may He be blessed. How is it with food? One who eats a little in order to live that he be healthy to study much Torah and to do great service in the service of God. And he drinks to fill his thirst and not to get drunk and [so] not 'expose himself within his tent.' And that which he only has sexual relations to fulfill the commandment, behold this is from the way of abstinence - as his intention is not to enjoy from the world. And there is also a second benefit: that he guard his soul from sin - as when his impulse overpowers him and he desires to do a sin, he will say in his heart, \"I am vigilant about what is permissible, [so] how can I do this great evil, and 'I will have sinned to my Father in heaven all of the days.'\" And this thing will [protect] him from all of the stumbling blocks. But one who goes after natural physicality and is pulled by his desires and his pleasures - even if he does not do a forbidden thing - will be found to have distanced himself from the fundamentals of his soul and its foundation. He will have also caused his soul to follow the body and the physical and 'sever it with an ax from its roots and  its foundation.' And [it is] as it is written (Hoshea 4:11), \"Promiscuity, wine and new wine take the heart.\" Hence they gave a counsel to the one who is not able (to lead) to control his spirit and is pulled by the pleasures, to make a vow for some days to say, \"I will not eat and not drink until time x except like this\"; or to forbid what is permissible. And [then] his habit will control him, from that which he observes his vow. It comes out that he leads himself to conquer his impulse. And with this, the benefit that is in his hand is abstinence. And [it is] as [someone] said to Rabbi Pinchas (the editor said [that] this statement is in Yerushalmi Shabbat 1:3 and the version there is \"to Rav\"), \"If you are not able to eat mundane foods in purity all of the year, eat [it so] for seven days.\" As one who eats mundane foods in purity is called an abstinent, as we say (Chagigah 18b), \"The clothes of an ignoramus are impure in <i>midras</i> for the abstinent (<i>prushim</i>).\" However it is not fit to fence oneself with fences unless his impulse is overpowering him, [and then] he may make a vow as a way of healing. However one who controls his spirit and is able to reach the trait of abstinence without a vow should not vow. [It is] as we said (Yerushalmi Nedarim 9:1), \"Is it not enough for you with what the Torah forbade, such that you forbid yourself the permitted?\" But certainly if you see a man whose impulse is overpowering him, he needs to add a big fence according to that which he needs to conquer his impulse. And once he has conquered his impulse, he goes back to the moderate disposition. There is a parable about a physician [relevant to this]: When the physician sees that the illness is mild and easy to heal, he gives him a mild treatment. But when he sees that he illness is heavy and strong, he chooses a strong treatment until he heals; and afterwards, he goes back and gives him moderate things that hold the body's health. And because of this, they said, \"Vows are a safeguarding fence around abstinence\" - and they did not say, \"Oaths are a safeguarding fence around abstinence.\" As an oath halts immediately, as he swears that he will not eat this thing until day x. And that is not a safeguarding fence - as he is halted immediately, in that he cannot transgress it. But a vow is that he say, \"If I eat more than this amount until day x, all of the fruits of the world will be forbidden until a different time that he specifies. That is called a safeguarding fence, as it is a thing that he may overstep. And it is better for the one whose heart is dedicated to the Heavens if he is not in control of himself to do the safeguarding fence without a vow.",

With wisdom, how is it? He does not speak in front of someone greater than him in wisdom. As one who studies in front of his teacher and sees a fit rationale should not immediately think that it is true; and he should not want to say it until his teacher has finished speaking. For were he to do so, he would miss what his teacher will say and he will not know the rationales of the earlier sages; as his heart will be 'moving and wandering from knowing their opinion.' And also because his [own] rationale cannot be so focused until he hears what the early scholars said and [then] weigh in the scales of his intellect which one is more proper - this one or that one. Therefore silence for a student in front of his teacher \"is a safeguarding fence for wisdom.\" And when he finds a rationale and his teacher is still speaking, should he not be quiet?

In any event, he will reach true wisdom and find knowledge of God. And about this Ben Zoma said, \"Who is the wise one?

And even from the one who only knows (another) [one] thing does he learn; and then his path becomes successful and he will become enlightened. And because of this he is called a wise one,<b> as it says, \"I have acquired understanding from all my teachers\" (Psalms 119:99).</b> As so did David, peace be upon him, say - that he learned from every person; and he did not say, \"This one is not as knowledgeable as I.\" Rather he learned from them all and became enlightened.

And this is dissimilar for man and beast, as animals do not have might of the heart. And about this, Ben Zoma said that the braver and stronger power of the heart is that which overcomes the impulse. As might in war is not such a great thing and 'like you, like them, in the description of men' - if they have power, this one also has strength, if 'they prepared their hands for battle, their fingers for war.'

As the angry one that takes revenge immediately, confounds his actions and acts without intelligence. And about this, Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated, \"slowness to anger is better than a mighty person.\" The one who holds his anger - even though he does not forgive during his anger - since he leaves the matter of revenge until later, [shows] more might of the heart than the mighty one in war; as also without intelligence can he be mighty in fighting. But \"the ruler of his spirit\" - which is more than one who is slow of anger, since he forgives during his anger, as he fears the word of God - is mightier \"than the conqueror of a city.\" [This is] even though [the latter] has two things - might of the heart and wisdom, as it is stated (Proverbs 21:22), \"A wise man climbed to a city of warriors, and brought down its mighty stronghold.\" As it is with might of the heart, wisdom and correct counsel that they conquer cities.

Rather, [it shows] that a person is happy [also] with this good trait: when he does not desire to gather money and he hates gifts. [Instead,] he eats from the work of his hands and suffices with it, like the one who is happy with his lot - as his want is only to support himself. And Ben Zoma arranged these three traits like the order of Yirmiyahu the prophet, peace be upon him: wisdom, might and wealth, as it is stated (Jeremiah 9:22), \"Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom; let not the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man glory in his wealth.\" He had wisdom precede might because it is a true virtue and it is in the intellect of the soul and sits in the body, not like might which is only in the body. Still, [might] is more elevated than wealth, since might is in his body - something that exists all the days that he is still alive - whereas wealth is outside of his body. And it is something transient, as he can make his wealth, and others take it [after only] half of his days. And even though the prophet stated that a man should not glory in these three traits, Ben Zoma made a distinction and said that there is a side of these traits that is without [physical] exertion and toil and that he can glory in: With wisdom, it is to be one learning (in every) [from every] man. As such, he will understand fear of God; and there is no exertion in it, as it is wisdom and not work. With might, it is to overcome his impulse and to forgive during his anger. In this too he can glory, since he is doing it from his fear [of God]. And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him,  stated (Proverbs 19:11), \"It is the intellect of a man that is slow to anger; it is his glory when he overlooks an offense.\" And since the desire of the one who is happy with his lot is only to learn and to keep the commandments, and when he has enough for his livelihood and support he is happy and recognizes that the rest is vanity, he is the 'rich' man who can glory in his wealth. As [in] all of these things, there is knowledge of the Creator, may He be blessed. [It is] as it is stated (Jeremiah 9:23), \"But only in this should the one who glories glory, in his using his intellect and knowing Me; that I the Lord act with kindness, justice, and equity in the world; for in these I delight, declares the Lord.\" And Ben Zoma added a fourth trait and said: ",

And all honor for the lowly is a loss for those that honor him, as his status is not increased. [It is] like Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 26:8), \"Like binding a stone in a sling, so is paying honor to a fool.\" As one who binds a stone in a sling is doing nonsense; and there is no honor given to the rock - as it was not elevated by this. And so [too] is it nonsense to give honor to a fool. It comes out that you will say that [with] all the honor that a person does to the created beings, he is honoring himself.

                "<b>as it says, \"For those who honor Me, I will honor; and those who despise Me will be held in little esteem\" (I Samuel 2:30):</b> And the proof of this verse is from an a fortiori argument (<i>kal vechomer</i>): If [with] the Holy One, blessed be He, that all of His creatures were only created for His glory, as it is stated (Isaiah 43:7), \"that I have created for My honor\" - and it would not be justified to owe them good for this, since they were not created for anything else and this is their work, and they have no right to do anything else - nonetheless, it stated, \"For those who honor Me, I will honor\"; all the more so and all the more so [with regard] to his fellows who a person is not (concerned) [obligated] to honor, [that] if he honors him, he will honor him [back], and raise him on his palms.

And this is what is stated (Isaiah 3:11), \"Woe to the evil wicked man; as his hands have dealt, so shall it be done to him.\" And about this the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Yoma 38b), \"One who comes to purify himself is helped; one who comes to defile himself is given openings.\" [That] is to say that if he comes to defile himself, he is not helped; but has many openings in which to enter and do evil - as he is left to do what is good in his [own] eyes.

(Rav said,) 'For example, [if] I took meat from the butcher and did not give him money immediately.'\" Hence the sages and men of repute (need) to watch their deeds more than other people. And every man is according to his standing. 'And anyone who wants to take the name (and consider himself important in this regard), let him come and take [it].' And they said in Tractate Sanhedrin 74a that even for tying a shoelace (in the way of the gentiles), he should let himself be killed and not transgress. This is not by way of obligation, yet one should let himself be killed for this - as he is doing a commandment that sanctifies God, may He be blessed, and [so] 'he acquires his [share in the] world [to come] in an instant. But in three things everyone is obligated to let himself be killed for them; and if he transgresses and does not allow himself to be killed, it is a major sin [in itself] like idolatry, murder and sexual immorality. And the punishment for public desecration of the Name is greater than those three, as it is stated (Ezekiel 20:39), \"As for you, House of Israel, thus said the Lord God, 'Go, every one of you, and worship his idols and continue, if you will not obey Me; but do not desecrate My holy name any more with your idols and your gifts.'\" Behold, it is elucidated for you that He was more (in remembrance of) [exacting about] that which they were worshiping idols because they were desecrating His holy Name publicly than [because] of the idolatry itself. And [hence] that which we learned, \"Anyone who desecrates the Name of Heaven secretly,\" is speaking about things that are a desecration of the Name in of themselves, like idolatry - as he is affirming [the idol's] divinity. And so too, the one who swears falsely with the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He - which is deceiving the minds of the creatures - is a desecration - as it is stated (Leviticus 19:12), \"You shall not swear falsely by My Name, desecrating the Name of your God; I am the Lord.\"",
                "<b>There is no differentiation between unintentional and intentional when it comes to desecration of the Name:</b> Not that he is punished for the unintentional like the intentional; but rather that also for the unintentional is he punished publicly, and each one 'will carry [the punishment] according to his transgression.' [This is] because the unintentional is considered a transgression [in such a case] when it is not beyond his control, since he should have been careful that it not come to him - and he was not careful. Therefore the verse obligates him in a sacrifice in order to atone for him."

As behold, they tied up Rabbi Tarfon to throw him into the river, as they thought that he was a thief. And he (only) said, \"Woe to Tarfon, as this one is killing him.\" And since they [then] recognized that he was Rabbi Tarfon, they let him go and he ran away. All of the days of that righteous one, he was anguished about this thing and said, \"Woe is to [me] that I have made use of the crown of Torah\" - since anyone who makes use of the crown of Torah does not have a portion in the world to come. And we say the reason is because Rabbi Tarfon was very rich and he could have appeased him with money (Nedarim 62a). And we also say in Bava Batra in the first chapter (Bava Batra 8a) [that] Rabbi (Rabbi Yehuda Hanassi) opened his storehouses in a year of drought. He said, \"Let the masters of scripture, the masters of Mishnah and the masters of Talmud enter! Let the ignoramuses not enter!\" Rabbi Yochanan ben Amram pushed and entered; he said, \"Rabbi, sustain me.\" He said [back] to him, \"Have you  read [scripture]?\" \"No.\" \"Have you studied mishnah?\" \"No.\" \"And if so, with (in the merit of) what should I sustain you?\" He said, \"Sustain me like a dog or a raven.\" He got up and sustained him. But after he left, he said, \"Woe to me, since I gave from my money to an ignoramus.\" Rabbi Shimon beRabbi said to him, \"Maybe that was Yonatan ben Amram, your student, who does not want to benefit (with the honor) [from the honor] of Torah.\" They  checked and found that it was like his words. [Hence], Rabbi said, \"Let all enter!\" But [didn't] Rabbi also say [he wanted] to sustain [based] on the honor of Torah? Rather it was a year of drought, when it is a commandment to sustain whoever is lacking his needs; and the one who needs may take. However Rabbi did not want to give benefit from his money to ignoramuses. And Rabbi followed his reasoning, as Rabbi said, \"Punishment only comes to the world because of ignoramuses.\" And nonetheless Yonatan ben Amram [went] beyond the letter of the law. As since he saw that they were only sustaining Torah masters, he said, \"If so, they are sustaining based on the honor of Torah\" - and he did not want to benefit from the honor of Torah. And it appears that maybe if they had not been willing to sustain him on the condition that he was an ignoramus, he would have sustained himself through the honor of Torah - as this transgression is no greater than all of the commandments in the Torah, about which it is stated (Leviticus 18:5), \"and live by them\" and not that he die by them, except for the three known ones (Yoma 85b). And that which they said (Ketuvot 105b), \"From here, [we see] that the verse counts one who brings a gift to Torah scholars as if he brings up the first fruits\" - they only said it about something to which commoners are [also] accustomed, as it is the way of people to bring a gift to an important person even if he is an ignoramus. And that which the sages said (Berakhot 10b), \"[A scholar] who wants to benefit, he may benefit  like Elisha\" - this is [referring to] one who puts his merchandise into the 'pocket' of Torah scholars (for them to resell for a profit), their reward for which is great and it is permissible. And the verse also exempts them from types of taxes and fees and even from money for the poll tax, and other [benefits] that are known from tradition that the Holy One, blessed be He, allowed Torah scholars. And so did Rabbi Meir (Halevi), may his memory be blessed, arrange the matter."

                "<b>Rabbi Elazar HaKapor says: Envy:</b> The explanation regarding the matter of envy is that there are two things that have two or three matters, and two which are not harmful. The first way is envy of the good, and it is the [worst] way. And the first manner [of this] is that when his fellow sees good, it is bad in his eyes. And when [the latter] is occupied with Torah [study] and the commandments and goes in the good path, he [begrudges] him - as he hates those that love God and those that do His will. This trait drives him from the world and it is the greatest evil in envy. And his name is called the haters of God. And the second manner is that it is not bad in his eyes from the angle that he hates the path of involvement in Torah. Rather it is [that] since he does not walk in that path, he also does not want his fellow to go in it. As it is his will that no one find more good than he - not for his benefit, but for the harm of others. This one is also called the haters of God - since he does not do the acts of God, it is also hard in his eyes to see his fellows doing [them], and even if he does not hate like the first. But there is a good path in envy, even if there is a better one. That is what the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Batra 21a), \"The envy of scribes increases wisdom\" - since by his seeing that his fellows are holy and wise, he also wants to be like them. And because of envy, he increases his wisdom and he toils and intensifies doing good and walking in the straight path. However, it is more valuable if he desires these without envy, as [in that case] they (are the speech of) [are the ones that fear] the Lord - and that is the work of man. And this is what King Shlomo, peace be upon, stated (Ecclesiastes 4:4), \"I have seen that all labor and skillful enterprise are from men’s envy of each other; this too is vanity and broken spirit.\" He meant to say that even if he does an act skillfully; if he does it from envy of men, while he does good, there is [also] much bad. As one who does what is fitting from the generosity of his heart goes truthfully and with a full heart. [Such a one] is more worthwhile than the one who does it out of the envy of  men when it comes to his heart. And if from this or from that, the act is done; 'but it is good for you to grasp the first without letting your hand go of [the other].' The second way is the envy of money. The first manner [of this] is the seeker of evil - and it is hard in his eyes that others have wealth, since he does not. And there is none in [this way of envy] as evil as this [one] - as he hates the good of the creatures and does not want the betterment of the world. And the second manner is one envious of his wealthy fellows; and it is hard in his eyes when they are wealthier than he. It is not from his hatred for them and for their wealth and that he desires that it be reduced. Rather, it is from his love of  wealth and his desire to be very wealthy; since wealth is honor in his eyes, and he wants to more honored than they. And the third manner is the best of the bad [ones] - he loves money and is envious of it and desires that he should have great wealth. But he is not concerned if others have little or much. And this one's envy is not burning like the one that wants to be wealthier than all people. And King Shlomo, peace be upon him, grouped all of these things and stated (Proverbs 23:17), \"Do not envy sinners in your heart, but only fear of the Lord all of the day.\" He first explained [that] the worst envy is not to be envious of the wicked that do sins, to do like them. And afterwards he stated more generally, \"but only fear of the Lord\" - all envies are negative except for the envy of fear [of God]. He should be envious of the 'acts of God, as He is awesome.'",
                "<b>lust (desire):</b> It is the beginning of all activities and actions and is even before thought. As when he wants something from his desire for it, he thinks about doing it. And there is much bad in all desires. There is no need to say the desire of the impulse to sins, but even the desire for much permissible laying with women is very bad. And about this Sholmo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 31:3), \"Do not give your strength to women.\" And, so too, much desire for permissible food and drink - this too is bad. And it is like the wise men of science said, that even light and good foods are harmful to the one who eats much of them. And this is what they said in Tractate Pesachim 114a, \"Do not accustom yourself to eat geese, as your heart will stalk you.\" And there are three bad ways of desire, [just] like with envy: The first is one who desires that there should not be  wealth and honor to any [other] person, and that he should have them. And that is a transgression that he [commits]. And the second one desires for wealth and wisdom, but if others [also] have it, the thing is good in his eyes - except that he should have more than them, to be greater than them. There is also much bad in this. And in the third there is a little good. [It is the one] who when he sees that his fellows have wisdom and wealth, he desires that he should also be like them. And it is very good in his eyes that they be like him and 'God should add to them from Him a thousandfold and bless him and them.' And this trait is not completely good, in that his desire is from the angle that others are wise and understanding and wealthy. As the fitting desire is to desire for wisdom from the angle that it is the foundation and root of service to the Creator, may He be blessed; and to do with the wealth that which is straight in the eyes of the Lord - and not because of [any] other thing. And this is what King David, peace be upon him, stated (Psalms 38:10), \"Lord, all my desire is in front of You.\" He wanted to say that all of his desire is from the angle of Heaven and from envy of men. And so [too] do we find with our holy Rabbi, peace be upon him (Ketuvot 104a) that at the time of his departure (death), he raised his fingers and said, \"It is revealed and known in front of You, Master of the worlds, that I have not enjoyed even [the worth of] a small finger.\" And even though our rabbis said about him (Bava Metzia 85a) that he was very wealthy, such that his key carrier [had] like the wealth of Shavur Malka (the king of Persia), nonetheless [Rabbi] only enjoyed for the sake of Heaven - as he did not desire the vanities of the world.",
                "<b>and honor:</b> The bad honor is [practiced by] the one who gets honor from people in order to impose his fear upon them and 'he strikes terror into the land of the living.' And what is his reward? That he will descend into the depths of the pit in Gehinnom, [such] that there is no ascent form his fall for [all] generations. And because of this the prophet Yechezkel compares the fall of the kings of the nations in Gehinnom to the one who 'strikes terror into the land of the living,' to say that they have no ascent, as it is stated (Ezekiel 32:32), \"I strike My terror into the land of the living; and lay among the uncircumcised those who were the casualties of the sword.\" And the second [way] of honor is the one who wants that people should honor him, as he thinks that he is fit for this honor - but he is not. Even if he is a Torah scholar and a master of commandments and his will is that they honor him for this, he is 'sinning with his soul' - unless his intention is for the sake of Heaven, and if it is only for the honor of the Torah that he is [seeking it] and he does not take it for himself and does not enjoy it, but it is only in order to have the Torah honored about (through) this, as we have written. However all other things regarding honor are very bad. And how much did the Torah warn and forbid it to them! As even with a king of Israel about whom it stated (Deuteronomy 17:15), \"Surely place a king upon you\" - that you should put his fear upon you (Ketuvot 17a) - and [so] he is fit for honor more than all of the creatures under the skies, nonetheless it still warns him that he should not raise his heart over his brothers. All the more so should commoners not desire honor at all.  ",

And this is what is stated (Psalms 119:126), \"It is a time to act for the Lord, for they have violated Your Torah\" - if you see a generation that is negligent from [study] of the Torah, be involved in it (Berakhot 63a). And the simple meaning of the verse is \"It is a time to act for the sake of the Lord.\" And similar to it is (Genesis 20:13), \"say for me, 'He is my brother'\" - [which is] like \"for my sake.\" \"They have violated your Torah\" - since they are all violating Your Torah, I should do for the sake of the Lord more than in other generations, so that Torah is not, God forbid, forgotten in Israel. There is a parable [relevant to this] about a king whom all of his servants betrayed except for one. Does [that servant] not need to go with him truthfully and with a whole heart at that time more than other times? And so all of his days the king will love him with a great love and increase his gift [to be] equal to the gifts of all of them [together]. "

                "<b>With ten tests Abraham, our father, was tested - and he withstood them all:</b> The first was 'Ur (which besides being a place name can also mean fire) Kasdim' - that Nimrod dropped him down into the fiery furnace and he was saved. And this is not explicit in the Torah and it is from the words of tradition. But we have a hint about this thing from the Torah; that before Parshat Lech Lecha Meartsekha ouMemoladetekha, Ur Kasdim is mentioned twice above [it], to make known that it was because of that test that he withstood that God, may He be blessed, promised him and brought him to the land [of Israel. This is] like we find with Noah. As at the beginning it is written (Genesis 6:8), \"But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord,\" and afterwards in Parshat Eleh Toledot Noach that he was saved from the waters of the flood - [which indicates that it was] because he found favor in his eyes. And the second is that He commanded him to go out from his land and from his birthplace, and he did so. And the third is that is stated (Genesis 12:10), \"And there was a famine in the land.\" And even though the Holy One, blessed be He, promised him and said to him (Genesis 12:3), \"And all the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you”; when He brought the famine, he did not question His traits. The fourth is the taking of Sarah to Pharaoh. The fifth is the war of the four kings when he deployed [only] three hundred and eighteen men and trusted in the Holy One, blessed be He; and a miracle was done for him that he was saved and he saved his brothers and all of the property of Sedom and Ammorah. And he endured the events [accepting that it was] for his good and for his merit. The sixth is that he was ninety-nine when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin [and] placed himself in danger due to his old age, and he was saved. The seventh is the taking of Sarah to Avimelekh. The eighth is when he sent Hagar and Yishmael away by the commandment of God. And [even] if 'the thing was bad in his eyes on account of his son,' he fulfilled the commandment. The ninth was the binding of Yitzchak his son, about which it is written (Genesis 22:12), \"For now I know that you fear God.” And did He not know until now - and is not everything revealed and seen in front of Him? Rather when the thing is known to the creatures, the Holy One, blessed be He, calls it, \"For now I know that you fear God.\" And it comes to inform us that [this showed] greater fear of Heaven than all of the other commandments in the Torah. Since with all the tests except for this, He did not say to him \"that you fear God\" - as this test was the greatest of all of them, since he took his son to bring him up as a sacrifice. The tenth was the burial of Sarah. As it was stated to him (Genesis 13:17), \"Get up, walk about the land, through its length and its breadth, for I give it to you”; but when his wife died, he could not find a place to bury her until he bought it - and he did not question.",
                "<b>in order to show how great was the love of Abraham, our father:</b> He tested him in order to reveal to the creatures that he feared God and was complete in all of his traits."

                "<b>Ten miracles were performed for our ancestors in Egypt:</b> As our forefathers were not hurt by all of the ten plagues that the Holy One, blessed be He, brought on the Egyptians in Egypt. And it is explicit in all of them except the plague of lice, about which it is written (Exodus 8:14), \"and the lice were upon men\" - and the Torah did not distinguish between Egypt and Israel. But it is a tradition in the hand of the sages that also with this [one] were they not struck .",
                "<b>and ten [miracles were performed] at the [Reed] Sea:</b> The first is the splitting of the Reed Sea, as it is stated (Exodus 14:21), \"and He opened the waters.\" The second is that the water formed a bow and like a type of dome and it came out that the water was on top of them. And about this is it stated (Habakuk 3:14), \"You have pierced with his rods, the head of his rulers.\" The third is that the springs of the great foundations opened and [absorbed all the moisture so that] no mud or sludge remained on its ground, as [is not the case] when other springs dry up. Rather it was like marble stone on its bottom and [so] Israel crossed the sea as one who walks in his house. The fourth is that the places that the Egyptians tread upon in the sea were like a type of clay, and this is what the verse states (Habakuk 3:15), \"Your horses tread the sea, the clay of the mighty waters.\" It states \"Your horses,\" as also the horses of the Egyptians were given into the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He.  And the fifth is that the waters hardened more than necessary and they became hard as boulders and slabs and hurt the Egyptians that were chasing Israel. And about this King David, peace be upon him, stated (Psalms 74:13), \"You smashed the heads of the sea monsters upon the waters\" - these sea monsters were the Egyptians. The sixth was that [the waters] were torn into twelve parts - one path for each tribe that would pass over there. And this is what is stated (Psalms 136:13), \"to tear the Reed Sea into many parts.\" The seventh is that the partitions between one tribe and another were clear like white glass so that the tribes could see one another. The eighth is that the water did not congeal into one piece, but rather it was made into [many] small pieces - like one block on top of another and one brick on top the other, as it is written (Psalms 74:13), \"You crumbled the sea with Your power.\" The ninth is that the sweet (fresh) water did not harden like the rest of the waters of the sea but [rather] would flow; and they would drink from all of the streams going towards the sea. The tenth is that after their drinking, [the fresh water] would immediately harden - as the flowing water would not descend to the floor. Rather, Israel would drink from it, and the rest would go out and fall to the ground like a piece of snow. And so too each and every time that they needed to drink. ",

The fourth is \"He removed the wheels of their chariots\" (Exodus 14:25) - that He removed the wheels from the wagons and the Egyptians fell and were crushed. The fifth is \"and they drove with heaviness\" (Exodus 14:25) - after they fell and were crushed, they could not stand. And [so,] they stayed in the place that they fell. And the sixth is that they wanted to flee and they could not, as it is stated (Exodus 14:25), \"And Egypt said, 'Let us flee from Israel.'\" And [this is] not like we found with Sisera, as it stated (Judges 4:15), \"and Sisera descended from his chariot and fled on foot.\" But these did not descend and they did not have the possibility of fleeing. And the seventh is \"And the Lord shook the Egyptians into the sea\" (Exodus 14:27) - likes its [classic Aramaic] translation, \"and He confounded,\" which is an expression of breaking. As He shook them like a man shakes a pot, [such] that what is above [goes] below and what is below [goes] above. And the eighth is that the earth at the bottom of the sea swallowed them, as it is stated (Exodus 15:12), \"You stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them.\" The ninth is that they descended heavily into the depths of the sea like lead, as it stated (Exodus 15:10), \"They sank like lead in the mighty waters.\" The tenth is that the sea spit them out, as it stated (Exodus 14:30), \"And Israel saw Egypt dead on the shore of the sea.\"  ",
                "<b>[With] ten trials did our ancestors test the Omnipresent, blessed be He, in the Wilderness, as it is said (Numbers 14:22): \"Yet have they tested Me these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice:\"</b> The first is that they said (Exodus 14:11), \"Are there not enough graves in Egypt?\" And the second is (Exodus 15:24), \"And the people grumbled against Moses, saying, 'What shall we drink?'\" And a miracle happened that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moshe to throw wood into the bitter waters, as it is stated (Exodus 15:25), \"And he cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a piece of wood.\" And they said in Tractate Pesachim that this tree [that the wood come from] was a <i>hardofanei</i>, which is bitter. He threw bitter into bitter and it turned sweet. (The editor said, I did not find this in Pesachim, but rather in Rashi on Pesachim 39 in the name of the Mekhilta on Parshat Beshalach. And Tosafot on Pesachim 36 cites the Mekhilta that it was an olive tree; and in truth these are two [different] opinions in the Mekhila - see there.) The third was in the Wilderness of Sin when they asked for bread, as it stated (Exodus 16:3), \"when we sat over the fleshpot.\" The fourth is (Exodus 17:7) \"Is the Lord amongst us or not?\" There is a parable [relevant to this] about a man who carried his son on his shoulder; and [the son] was competent, but he said, \"Have you seen Father?\" What did his father do? He flung him from his shoulder. So did the Holy One, blessed be He, carry them 'on the wings of eagles' - [and yet they] ask, \"Is the Lord amongst us?\" What did He do? He brought Amalek upon them. The fifth is that they left manna over. The sixth is that in Refidim 'they did not have water for the congregation' (the editor says, I could not understand this, as he already counted this in the fourth test; and further study is also required about his whole count regarding this, and see Arakhin 16). The seventh was at Chorev with the story of the [golden] calf, as it is stated (Exodus 32:1), \"the people gathered against Aharon, etc.\" The eighth was (Numbers 11:1), \"And the people were like grumblers of evil in the ears of the Lord.\" And 'He set a fire of the Lord against them and it consumed the edge of the camp,' 'as the Lord, your God, is a consuming Fire, He is a jealous God.' The ninth was at the Graves of Desire (Kivrot HaTaavah) when they said (Numbers 11:4), \"Who will feed us meat?\" And did they not have meat; and did they not have the quail at each and all times, as it is stated (Exodus 16:8),  \"in that the Lord will give you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to satiation.\" And [just] like the manna did not cease, the quail [also] did not cease. Rather they wanted meat in the evening to satiation, [just] like they had the bread. And about this our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, stated,   (Numbers 11:22), \"Could enough flocks and herds be slaughtered to suffice them, etc.\" Our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, \"They have much meat; their request is [only] from the evil of their hearts. And 'since they are a stiff-necked people,' even if You give them much more, they will continue to say [there is] not enough. 'Could enough flocks and herds be slaughtered' - and their mouths will [still] not be satiated.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said [back] to Him, \"'Is the hand of the Lord short?' I will give them meat until they are satisfied and they will no [longer] be able to open their mouths to say, 'we are not satiated'.\" And He added and brought them much more of the quails 'and they spread them all around' 'and the least gathered ten chomer' and they could not eat it [all]. Such is the simple meaning of the verse. And you will [hence] come to say that Moshe did not sin with his words. But our rabbis in the Talmud (Yoma 75a) did not interpret it thus. And the tenth was in Midbar Paran when they sent the scouts. And there it states (Numbers 14:22), \"and they have tried Me these ten times.\""
