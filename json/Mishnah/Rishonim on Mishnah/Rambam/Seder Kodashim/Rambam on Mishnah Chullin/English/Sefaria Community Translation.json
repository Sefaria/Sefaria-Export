                "One who slaughters an animals and finds in it an 8 month old fetus that lives: A full grown fetus that lives that is permitted to eat without slaughter, the helev and blood are not permitted by the rabbis and know that it doesn't need checking [for treifot]. We want to say that treifot do not cause loss since according to us it is already slaughtered even though it is alive. The halacha follows the chachamim on condition it [the fetus] did not walk on the ground. And the words of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri that allows it even if it did walk on the ground are not the law."
