                "Mishnah: \"We do not inspect (regarding impurity) from the altar and above, etc.\" Commentary: \"It is explained in the end of the tractate Middot: The Sanhedrin (Great Court) had the responsibility to inspect every eligible priest performing the service. If any blemish was found in him, they would remove him. Similarly, the inspectors (dokhanim) who were Levites would say about the Levites who sang the song, they would inspect them, and only afterwards would they elevate them. Likewise, the Sanhedrin consisted only of priests, Levites, and Israelites with proper lineage. We will clarify this further in the tractate Sanhedrin, as it is stated about them, 'And you shall stand there with you' - resembling you in wisdom, faith, and lineage. As for the public officials (shotrei haverim), they were appointed in Jerusalem because they were not authorized to serve as judges by themselves, but only with proper lineage, even in monetary matters. The treasurers of charity (gabbaei tzedakah), on the other hand, were in constant conflict with people because they would trouble them with the giving of charity, which is a fundamental principle for us. They would collect charity even on Friday evenings. However, if any fraudulence was found in them, they would disqualify them immediately, and the matter would be heard. The assessors of birds' values (arakhim) would only testify about them if they had proper lineage. And the Astaria of King Pankas (a military conscription), they would go out to war with the kings of the House of David, but only those with proper lineage would be taken for war, so that the merit of their ancestors would assist them.\""
