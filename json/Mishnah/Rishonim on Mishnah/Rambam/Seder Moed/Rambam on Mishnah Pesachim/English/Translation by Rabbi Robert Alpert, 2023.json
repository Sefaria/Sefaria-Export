                "The searching for the Hametz/leaven should not be other than on the night of the fourteenth [of Nisan] even though Hametz is not forbidden to eat until midday of the fourteenth [of Nisan] as will be explained (in Mishnah 4). And they (i.e., the Rabbis) established/ordained this because the light of the candle at night is pleasant to search and for examination (see Tractate Pesahim 8a), and all people are in their homes at that time (see Tractate Pesahim 4a). And the night is called אור in the manner that several things are called by their opposite (see the Jerusalem Talmud Tractate Peah, Chapter 8, Halakha 5 and the commentary of Maimonides to Tractate Sheviit, Chapter 3, Mishnah 1), and it (i.e., the Mishnah) did this order to speak in a pleasant and exalted language (see Tractate Pesahim 3a), and there should not be the opening of the book (i.e., the tractate) in the name of absence/lack of that which is absence/lacking, meaning to say, the darkness.",
                "ומרתף (storeroom/cellar where vessels are stored in rows and layers) – it is the name of a wine storeroom. But this Mishnah has an emendation, and is to be corrected as such: Every place where they don’t bring in Hametz into it (see Tractate Pesahim 8b) does not require examination/checking, but storehouses of wine and oil do not require examination/searching. So, for what reason does the Mishnah state: “Two rows in the storeroom, etc.?” Describe for yourself a house filled with arched, pointed vessels/jugs of wine, lengthwise ten jugs and widthwise ten, and at its height ten – each jug/arched pointed vessel at the side of its neighbor until there would be one-thousand jugs. The School of Shammai states that we examine/check the rows that are opposite the opening to length and its width which are one-hundred jugs, and similarly, the rows that are opposite the ceiling of the house lengthwise and widthwise which are one-hundred jugs, and this is the matter that it (i.e., the Mishnah) states: \"שתי שורות על פני כל המרתף\". But the School of Hillel states: examine only twenty jugs which are two rows one underneath the other opposite the opening of the storeroom/cellar from above that are adjacent to the ceiling, and this is the matter of it (i.e., the Mishnah) saying: \"שתי שורות החיצונות שהן העליונות.\""

                "בתוך המועד ואחר המועד – meaning to say within the days of the Festival [of Passover] and after the days of he Festival (see Maimonides in the Laws of Hametz and Matzah, Chapter 3, Halakha 5, and not as Rashi explained – at the time of the burning. See also the Tosafot, Tractate Pesahim 10b, s.v., ואם). And the advantage/benefit of the search after the Festival [of Passover] is in order to remove it so that he will not derive benefit from it because the general principle among us is that (see Tractate Pesahim, Chapter 2, Mishnah 2 – Tractate Pesahim 28a) leavened matter over which Passover has passed (which had been in the house during Passover) is prohibited to derive benefit from it. And it states (i.e., in the Mishnah): \"ומה שהוא משייר\", it returns to the beginning of the subject matter and it states that on the eve of the fourteenth day [of Nisan] we search/examine for Hametz, and that which remains we place in privacy until the time for its prohibition arrives, because he placed it in a removed state and he found that it is missing something from what he placed, he needs another search/examination, for we state that it is obvious that a mole dragged it (see The Laws of Hametz and Matzah, Chapter 3, Halakha 2, and Tractate Pesahim 9b). And the reason for the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Sages is that Rabbi Yehuda states – that if he did not search [for Hametz] at the time of the burning/ridding [of the Hametz] which is the hour of the prohibition of the Hametz, he does not check at all as a decree that perhaps he will eat from it (see Talmud Pesahim 11a). But the Sages did not decree this because they state that he himself will search after it to burn it, he will surely eat from it. And therefore they (i.e., the Sages) say that he should search during the Intermediate Days or after the Festival. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda."

                "It stated [in the Torah] (Exodus 12:19): “No leaven shall be found in your homes for seven days”, we learned from here that the obligation to absolutely get rid of/burn the Hametz before the seven days [of Passover (according to the Torah) (see Tractate Pesahim 5a), in order that the seven days, from their beginning until their end one will not find leaven in them (i.e., their homes) and it said (in the Torah – Exodus 12:15): “on the very first day you shall remove leaven from your homes”, here we knew that it is the fourteenth day [of Nisan], and it was appropriate to have the burning/removal of Hametz from the beginning of the fourteenth day [of Nisan], were it not for the fact that it states (Exodus 12:15): “on the very first day,” for [the word] \"אך\" is nothing other than a limitation, as if It is limited and stated this – that it (i.e., the verse from the Torah) states that this is on the first day is not from the beginning of the day but from part of it. And it follows from the hints to this accepted general principle to state that the burning/ridding of Hametz during part of the fourteenth day [of Nisan] is what it (i.e., the Torah), may it be exalted (Exodus 34:25): “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened,” and it comes through the received tradition that this is the partial [part], from the beginning of the seventh hour (like Rava in Tractate Pesahim 5a and see folio 58a). And everyone agrees that from the beginning of the sixth hour it is prohibited from their words (i.e., the Rabbis), distancing [itself] from the prohibition of the Torah. And the dispute of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, that Rabbi Meir says that one can eat at any time where it is permissible for him to feed, and Rabbi Yehuda states that a person should not eat during the fifth hour as a decree because of [the possibility of] a cloudy day (see Tractate Pesahim 12b and so has Maimonides decided in The Laws of Hametz and Matzah, Chapter 1, Halakha 9), where it is possible that an error could occur in the time.

                "The primary sources of ritual uncleanness are classified at the beginning of Seder/the Order of Taharot (Chapter 1 of Tractate Kelim) and from there you will know them. For all who touches/comes in contact with one of the primary causes of Levitical uncleanness is called a “first-degree [of ritual uncleanness]”, and a person who touches/comes in contact with a “first-degree [of ritual uncleanness]” is called a “second-degree [of ritual uncleanness],” and a person who touches a “second-degree [of ritual uncleanness]” is called a “third-degree [of ritual uncleanness],” and a person who touches a “third-degree [of ritual uncleanness]” is called a “fourth-degree [of ritual uncleanness].” But sometimes, we call the “first-degree [of ritual uncleanness]” the offspring of uncleanness, because it is of traceable descent to the primary source of Levitical uncleanness, and the “second-degree” is the offspring of the offspring of ritual uncleanness. And in this manner, we double [the usage of] the word “offspring with the “third-degree” and “fourth-degree” [of ritual uncleanness]. And sometimes we call the “first-degree” and “second-degree” and “third-degree” and “fourth-degree” of ritual uncleanness the offspring of uncleanness because all of them are subspecies of the primary source of ritual defilement.",
                "And it is stated [in the Mishnah] here \"ולד הטומאה\"/the offspring of uncleanness, meaning to say, the offspring of offspring of uncleanness. And know that meat that touched with the offspring of the offspring of uncleanness is third-degree of ritual uncleanness, but meat that was defiled through a primary source of ritual uncleanness is first-degree [of ritual uncleanness] and when the third-degree [of ritual uncleanness] would touch a first degree, it returns to become second-degree [of ritual uncleanness] as I have explained to you that all who touch first-degree [of ritual uncleanness] become second-degree [of ritual uncleanness]. And this Halakha announces to you that what is third-degree [of ritual uncleanness] it is permissible to make it second-degree [of ritual uncleanness], and this is the subject matter of what it says [in the Mishnah[: \"אע\"פ שמוסיפין לו טומאה על טומאתו\" because it (i.e., the meat) was third-degree [of ritual uncleanness] and it made it second-degree [of ritual uncleanness] (see Tractate Pesahim 14a), and this defilement that was added to is not other than from the Rabbis, but according to the Torah, the general principle with us is that food does not defile foo, for it is stated regarding the defilement of food that it is impure (see Leviticus 11:38 – “but if water is put on the seed and any part of a carcass falls upon it, it shall be impure to you”), and the accepted tradition comes that it is impure and does not make something similar to it [impure] (see Tractate Pesahim 14a), meaning to say that it doesn’t defile another food, but according to the Rabbis, food defiles [other] food and therefore that which is third-degree [of ritual uncleanness] becomes second-degree [of ritual uncleanness], and Rabbi Akiva added upon this and said that something that is third-degree [of ritual uncleanness] it is permitted to make it first-degree as I will explain for something who is defiled through contact with a corpse is within the primary sources of ritual uncleanness, and a person who touches/comes in contact with a corpse becomes a primary source of ritual uncleanness, and a person who comes in contact with/touches a primary source of ritual uncleanness becomes a first-degree of ritual uncleanness, and similarly a second-degree and third-degree and fourth-degree. But if the thing that touched/came in contact with the corpse were vessels, they are not made a primary source of ritual uncleanness, but they are accounted from them first and second-degree [of ritual uncleanness], but rather, their law is made like the law of the corpse itself, and a person who touches those vessels is impure for a seven-day period and it becomes a primary source of ritual impurity and from it we count first-degree and second-degree [of ritual impurity, and we learn from it what god said (Numbers 19:16): “a person who was killed or died naturally,[or human bone, or a grave, shall be impure seven days],” and the received tradition that [a person] who was killed by a sword is like a someone slain (see Tractate Pesahim 14b, 19b 79a, [Tractate] Shabbat 101b, [Tractate] Nazir 53b, [Tractate] Hullin 3a), and similarly the rest of metal vessels and vessels which require only rinsing in order to be restored to Levitical cleanness, their law is like the law of the sword. It is found that the law of vessels is more stringent that that of a human person forever in regard to defilement through a corpse with one degree, for if a person touched a corpse, the person becomes a primary source of ritual impurity without any doubt, and if another person touched him (i.e., the person who had come in contact with a corpse), that other person becomes first-degree [of ritual impurity] like we explained at the beginning of our words. And if vessels touched/came in contact with that same person who was defiled by a corpse that he is a primary source of ritual impurity, they are not made first-degree [of ritual impurity] but rather they are made a primary source of ritual impurity (see Numbers 31:24: “On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes and be pure”) and from them we begin to count first-degree and second-degree. And the general rules of all of this will be explained along with their proofs in depth at the beginning of Tractate Ahilot. And it is stated here [in this Mishnah], נר , meaning to say, a metal candle/light that has the laws of the vessels that we have explained, but not a candle/light of earthenware, because of the general principle with us – that an earthenware vessel cannot become a primary source of ritual impurity ever like it will be explained in the Tractate Kelim. And if a candle/light of metal touched a person defiled by corpse who is a primary source of ritual impurity, that candle cannot become first-degree [of ritual impurity] but rather becomes a primary course of ritual impurity as we have explained.",
                "ושמן שנפסל בטבול יום – is third-degree [of ritual impurity] as will be explained in Tractate Tevul Yom (Chapter 2, Mishnah 1), and when it is placed on the candle that was mentioned, it becomes first-degree [of ritual impurity] because the candle is a primary source of ritual impurity as we have explained, and it (i.e., the Mishnah) permitted to make something third-degree [of ritual impurity] first-degree [of ritual impurity]. But Rabbi Akiva required that the candle be a primary source [of ritual impurity] in order that the oil would be first-degree [of ritual impurity] and it would defile things similar to it from the Torah, because he holds that impure liquids defile another food according to the Torah, but if he would think that they are according to the Rabbis like they are according to the Halakha, and it would be enough for him with defilement of the Rabbis, it would be enough that the candle would be of earthenware, because the liquids alone whether they were defiled by a primary source [of ritual impurity] or by first-degree [of ritual impurity] or by second-degree [of ritual impurity], they are made first-degree [of ritual impurity] from the Rabbis, and this will be explained in its place in Seder Taharot. And these two matters are correct because they are testimony that they gave in what they saw. And this matter was brought here because it speaks about two ritually impure Hallot/loaves from the bread of Thanksgiving which are holy and burned."

                "Rabbi Meir holds that ritually impure liquids defile liquids like them only according to the Rabbis. But Rabbi Yossi holds that ritually impure liquids defile liquids like them according to the Torah (according to Rabbi Yermiah – see Tractate Pesahim 15b). But the principles of their argument will be explained in Tractate Taharot. But both of them agree that what was said above [in the Mishnah – see also Tractate Eduyot, Chapter 2, Mishnah 1]:\"לא נמנעו מלשרוף את הבשר שנטמא בולד הטומאה שהוא בשר שנטמא\" במשקין טמאין,/in impure liquids (“they never refrained from burning meat which had been made unclean by an offspring of uncleanness which had been made by a primary source of ritual uncleanness”). It is found that this meat, according to Rabbi Meir is an “offspring” according to the Rabbis because he holds like I explained to you that the impurity of liquids defiles others, according to the Rabbis. But according to Rabbi Yossi it is an “offspring” according to the Torah, as we explained his thinking. And since Rabbi Meir thought that Rabbi Hanina permitted burning the offspring of something ritually unclean according to the Rabbis with first-degree [of ritual impurity] according to the Torah , he stated from the words of Rabbi Hanina in their dispute with Rabbi Akiva: “We heard that is permissible to burn ritually pure heave-offering with that which is impure, because the offspring of the Rabbis concerning that which is first-degree [of ritual impurity] according to the Torah, there is no difference between this and what is ritually pure.",
                "ר' יוסי אינה היא המדה /Rabbi Yossi said – this is not the right argument/conclusion [to draw by analogy from the opinions of Rabbi Hanina and Rabbi Akiva], for Rabbi Yossi holds as we stated that this meat is ritually impure from the Torah. And therefore he said to him: if we permitted to burn something with a more stringent ritual defilement with something impure of a more lenient ritual defilement, we will permit the burning of something ritually pure with something ritually impure. It is found that the burning of ritually pure heave-offering with the impure, according to Rabbi Meir, according to his reasoning is the argument/conclusion. And further, Rabbi Yossi said to him, that even if Rabbi Yehoshua is the lenient one, he doesn’t permit to burn the ritually pure with the ritually impure, and he didn’t permit anything than to burn something held in suspense with that which is impure. And matters of what we do with the heave-offering held in suspense if they came in contact with it will be explained to you in Tractate Taharot. But Rabbi Yossi states that the fourteenth [of Nisan] that occurs on the Sabbath where we need to burn everything from before the Sabbath, we don’t burn other than that which is ritually impure by itself and that which is ritually pure by itself and that which is held in suspense by itself. And the Halakha is according to Rabbi Yossi when he said: We don’t burn the ritually pure with the ritually impure. But the impurity of liquids to defile others is Rabbinic according to Rabbi Meir."

And there the broken pieces are crumbs, and the explanation of [the word] \"מפרר\" – is breaking them into small pieces/crumbs (see Leviticus 2:6: “Break it into bits [and pour oil upon it; It is a grain offering].”) But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Yehuda. But if he had dry leavened bread, it is prohibited to throw it into the rivers until he breaks it into crumbs a great deal and according to the strength of its dryness, he continues to break it into crumbs its parts in order that it should be destroyed quickly (see also The Laws of Leaven and Matzah, Chapter 3, Halakha 11)."

And Rabbi Shimon says that what it (i.e., the Torah) may it be it be extolled and elevated, says: “My sacrifice” (Exodus 23:18) and “My sacrifice” (Exodus 34:25) twice, means to say, that at the time that he is liable, if he slaughtered one sacrifice with Hametz, he would be exempt if he slaughtered then the rest of the sacrifices with Hametz, and therefore, Rabbi Shimon says that if a person who slaughters the Passover Offering on the fourteenth [of Nisan] for its sake with Hametz, he is liable for flogging, but the rest of the sacrifices, if he slaughtered them on the fourteenth [of Nisan] with leaven, he exempt, but at the time that he is liable, if he slaughtered the rest of the sacrifices with Hametz, he would be exempt, if he slaughtered the Passover Sacrifice with Hametz.",

And there is no distinction between it saying during the Festival or during the rest of the days of the year. But the reason of Rabbi Shimon that if he slaughtered the rest of the sacrifices with Hametz on the other days of the year, \"בין לשמן בין שלא לשמן חייב חוץ מן החטאת ששחטה שלא לשמה\" - and this is the general rule among us and it is stated at the Beginning of [Tractate] Zevakhim : All the sacrifices that were slaughtered not for their purpose, even though they didn’t count for their owns because of the obligation are fit/appropriate except for the Passover Offering and from the Sin Offering, the Passover Offering at its appropriate time and the Sin-Offering at any time.

                "This Mishnah requires general principles/rules and I am explaining them to you, and this is that if someone with gonorrhea saw two attacks, he is defiled and counts seven days without an other attack and he becomes ritually pure when he immerses [in a Mikveh] on the seventh day and he may eat Holy Things in the evening. And similarly, if he saw three attacks he is defiled and counts seven days without any attacks and immerses [in a Mikveh] on the seventh day and brings a sacrifice on the eighth day and afterwards may eat Holy Things because he is lacking atonement, but someone who is lacking atonement does not eat Holy things. God said (Leviticus 15:2): “[Speak to the Israelite people and say to them:] When any man has a discharge issuing from his member, he is impure.”/\"[דברו אל-בני ישראל ואמרתם אלהם] איש איש כי יהיה זב מבשרו זובו טמא הוא\" - It (i.e., the Torah) mentions the word \"זיבות\"/a person suffering from gonorrhea- twice and it says that he is impure, and it states further (Leviticus 15:3): “The impurity from his discharge shall mean the following – whether his member runs with the discharge or is stopped up so that there is no discharge, his impurity means this.”/\"וזאת היהי טמאתו בזובו רר בשרו את-זובו או-החתים בשרו מזובו טמאתו הוא\" – it mentions the word \"זיבות\" three times and states his impurity/טומאתו , and the accepted tradition comes and counts two and calls him impure, [and it counts] three times and calls him impure. How can this be that two [mentions of the word זב] makes him impure but three [mentions of the word זב] requires of him a sacrifice (see Tractate Megillah 8a, Tractate Niddah 43b. But the details of the laws of the attack will be explained in their place and we don’t have the need to go into length with this. And similarly, the woman who saw blood not at the time of her menstrual cycle for three consecutive days, she becomes a woman with a flux and counts seven days without an attack and brings a sacrifice on the eighth day like a man with gonorrhea and she eats Holy Things (if she is married to a Kohen or is a divorced/single daughter of a Kohen) in the evening, as it states (Leviticus 15:25): “When a woman had a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her period of menstrual impurity, [she shall be impure, as though at the time of her menstrual impurity, as long as her discharge lasts].” And our received tradition comes [and teaches] that [the word] \"ימים\" means “two” [days] and that [the word] \"רבים\" means “three” days, for if she did not see it (i.e., blood) for one day, she watches until the morrow, if she didn’t see anything at all she immerses [in the Mikveh] on the second day and eats Holy Things at night. But if she also saw [blood] on the second day she keeps watch the third “day,” if she didn’t see anything, she immerses [in the Mikveh] on the third day and eats Holy Things at night, but if she saw [blood] also on the third day, she becomes a complete woman with a flux, and all these three days are called שומרת יום כנגד יום/a woman who observes a day for a day, and after knowing these general principles, this Halakhah will be explained completely. And this law according to the generally principle that I have announced to you is in the previous chapter (Mishnah six) and he for whom it is not appropriate to the Passover offering on the fourteenth [of Nisan] but he will be appropriate in the evening that they slaughter on his behalf, and with the condition that he already immersed [in a Mikveh] and he doesn’t need anything other than sunset and also he had already transmitted his sacrifices to the Bet Din if he was lacking atonement, and then he would slaughter on his behalf and even though that on the same day he is not appropriate, except for/besides someone who has ritual impurity upon contact with a corpse alone, like we have explained to you there."

And all of this is with the condition that the heap is round that if a corpse is found underneath it, we know with an absolute certainty that all that was on top of that heap was ritually impure because it was on top of a corpse (see Tractate Pesahim 91a). But if the place that he removes the debris of the heap/mound lengthwise and a corpse is found underneath it, it is exempt from observing the Second Passover, for we state that he was ritually pure at the time of the slaughter and it is possible that there wasn’t on top of the place that was opposite the corpse.
