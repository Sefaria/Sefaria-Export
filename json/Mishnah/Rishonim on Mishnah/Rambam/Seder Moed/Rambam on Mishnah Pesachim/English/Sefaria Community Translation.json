                "Charoset is mixture which has acidity in it and something similar to straw, and this is memory of the mortar. And we make it like this: Soak figs or dates and cook them and pound them until they are wet and knead them with spikenard or hyssop or something similar, without grinding them. And Rabbi Eliezer said that charoset is a mitzvah and in his opinion, one would need to say a blessing \"who has commanded about eating charoset\" and that is not the halakha. "
