And we separate him from his wife (see the Laws of the Service of Yom Kippur, Chapter 1, Halakha 3, where the term: \"ספק\" does not appear), lest she be found to be a menstruant woman and he would be ritually impure for seven days like it is explained in Scripture regarding someone who has sexual intercourse with a menstruant woman (see Leviticus 15:24: “[And if a man lies with her,] her menstrual impurity is communicated to him, he shall be impure seven days,” But the Sages state that ritual impurity is found, death is not found (see Tractate Yoma 13a), for if you are troubled by death, \"אין לדבר סוף\"/there would be no end to the matter, that we would be able to state lest the second [wife] die, and similarly, the third and/or fourth [wife die].

He offers up the portion first and states: I offer up this burnt offeirng , I offer up this meal offering. How so? He takes the part first. He says: This I consume, I consume; this guilt-offering I consume. When is this the case?

But if he didn’t have money, they collect from the monies of the Kohanim and they give it to him until he would be wealthier than any one of them, for God said (Leviticus 21:10): “who is exalted above his fellows”, that his brothers should glorify him. But in the Second Temple period, where in it all of the matters were not fully complete, like knowledge and the kings would not walk before the straight tradtition and they would appoint High Priests with power even though they are not worthy of it, and regarding them it is possible to say, \"שמא לא למדתה\" and because of the chamber where the High Priests live was called: \"לשכת פלהדרין\"./the chamber of assessors, our subject is the house of the officers/commissioners (see Tractate Demai, Chapter 2, Mishnah 4), that the kings appoint them over the markets and transfer them in a short time according to the will of the king (see Tractate Yoma 8b).

And this is according to the opinion of one who says that this is of the hardest/difficult forms of Divine Service in the Temple, but it will be explained at the beginning of [Tractate] Menahot (folio 11a and in Tractate Yoma 47b. But in the Laws of the Divine Service of Yom Kippur, Chapter 4, Halakah 1, it states that this is the hardest Divine Service in the Temple) that this is not the case, but rather it is like it states there that the handful of incense is like the people who take handfuls. And it was already explained to you in the fifth chapter of [Tractate] Shekalim, that the House of Abtinas [was responsible for] the actions regarding the incense, and they adjured him on the matter for it is impossible for any person to see if he changed it since the Sadducees hold that that one places the incense on the fire in the hall containing the Golden Altar and afterwards brings in the coal-pan to the House of the Holy of Holies (see Tractate Hillin 19b), an we learn this from what God, my He be exalted said (Leviticus 16:2): “for I appear in the cloud over the cover,” for he doesn’t enter to the cover/the place of atonement other thaan with the cloud, and the true tradition comes [teaching] that this is not is no (see Tractate Yoma 53a), but rather, that like it it explains when it (i.e., the Torah) says (LLeviticus 16:13): “He shall put the incense on the fire before the LORD, [so that the cloud from the incense screens the cover that is over -the Ark of -the pact, lest he die],” for it is impossible then for any individual to know what he did for God clearly said (Leviticus 16:17): “When he goes in [to make expiation in the Shrine] , nobody else shall be in the Tent of Meeting until he comes out, and therefore, we adjure him. He cries that they suspected him of engaging in herecy, and they also cry that they suspected him, because it is prohibited according to our Torah to suspect evil in a peson who is not known among us (see Tractate Yoma 19b, and Tractate Shabbat 97a, and compare the explanation of Maimonides to Tractate Avot, Chas you seeapter 1, Mishnah 6) but rather because we are forced to as you see."

But they don’t count the thumb for the person who put out his thumb because it is easy raise it and to bend it, and perhaps he will rraise it or bend it if the number approaches the end [of what is needed] in order that the lottery/allotment will come to him. And according to this system there were four lottteries that were in the Sanctuary. Know this and learn it, because these allotments/lotteries were not made clear to to any person before us in how the Gaonim explained what preceded us and who saw their words, because from the language of the Talmud no person would comprehend antyhing from them at first examination, but what is correct in those expressions is what we have explained."

And the order of the asking for the decision was lready mentioned, that the Kohen turns his face to the Ark, and the questioner turns his face behind the Kohen Gadol and asks: “Shall I do this or/and that or not?”, the Kohen will answer him and say to him, “Do it” or “Don’t do it,” according to what appears to him on the breastplate (see Tractate Yoma 73a), because it has a complete aphabetical listing, because Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are written on it (see Tractate Yoma 73b) and the names of the Twelve Tribes as will be explained in Scripture (see Exodus 28:21 and 39:14), and it is written after their names the Tribes of God (so it is also written in the Laws of the Vessels of the Temple Chapter 9, Halakha 7, and in the Babylonian Talmud, “The Tribes of Jeshurun” and in the Jerusalem Talmud “The Tribes of Israel,” and perhaps this was the reading that Maimonides had in his Talmud). And It is required that the Kohen is a prophet , because it is a received tradition among us that every Kohen that speaks in the Holy Spirit when the Divine Presence/Shekhina rests on him they ask him but when the he does not speak with the Holy Spirit and the Shekina does not rest upon him, they don’t ask him (see Tractate Yoma 73b). And that which it (i.e., the Mishnah) made a condition that they don’t ask him othe than a king and the Deputy Nasi, and similar things to it, for Scripture surely states concerning Joshua , and he is a King, and will stand before Eleazar the [High] Priest and will ask him for the judgment of the Urim bewfore God, he and the entire Jewish people with him, and the entire congregation (see Numbers 27:21: “But he shall present himself to Eleazar the Priest, who shall on his behalf seek the decision of the Urim before the LORD. By such instruction they shall go out and by such instruction they shall come in; he and all the Israelites, the whole community.), and it comes as a received tradition that “and all the Jewish people/Israelites” this is anointed for war, and “the entire congregation” this is the Sanhedrin. And similarly, all who need the community is included in this when it (i.e., the Torah) states, “and all of the Israelites with him”. And since we have mentioned what was written on the breastplate, I will inform you how the names of the Tribes were written on the stones of the Ephod and this is their order (see Tractate Sota 36b, and examine the commentary of the Kesef Mishneh for the Laws of the Vessels of the Temple, Chpater 9, Halakha 9): (On the right side, from top to bottom: Reuven, Levi, Issachar, Naftali, Gad and Yehosef; on the left side: Shimon, Yehuda, Zebulun, Dan, Asher and Benjamin). And you will find the number of indications on each stone is twenty five, but the name of Joseph is written as “Yehosef” as we have writen, and the allusion to hims is stated (Psalms 81:6): “He imposed it as a decree upon Joseph [when he went forth from the land of Egypt; I heard a language that I knew not.” But the stone in whih is written on its top “Reuben” on the right hand border, and that “Shimon” is written on its top on the left hand border."

                "It is not explained in the Torah the prohibition of these things on the Day of the Fast of Atonement, but rather, the language of \"ענוי\"/affliction appears five times. It states (Leviticus 23:32): “It shall be a sabbath of complete rest for you [and you shall practice self-denial/\"ועניתם את נפשותיכם\" ],” and it (the Torah) states (Leviticus 16;31): “It shall be a sabbath of complete rest for you [and you shall practice self-denial/\"ועניתם את נפשותיכם\"],” and (Numbers 29:7): ‘On the tenth day [of the same seventh month you shall practice a sacred occasions when you shall practice self-denial/\"ועניתם את נפשותיכם\"],” and (Leviticus 23:27), “Mark, the tenth day [of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It shall be a sacred occasion for you; you shall practice self-denial/\"ועניתם את נפשותיכם\"],” and (Leviticus 16:34): “This shall be to you [a law for all time;: to make atonement for the Israelites for all their sins once a year.”] (but, note that Maimonides does not mention the more appropriate verse in Leviticus 16:29: “In the seventh month of the tenth day of the month, you shall prace self-denial/\"תענו את נפשותיכם\"), and the accepted tradition comes to prohibit five things of bodily enjoyments (see Tractate Yoma 76a) which are feeding, and washing in water (there is no distinction between cold or warm water, as is found in Tractate Taanit 13a) and anointing with oil, and the wearing of leather sandals and sexual intercourse, and it states in each one of these “self-denial”/עינוי in Scripture but they are hints and [mere] supports, (see Tractate Yoma 76-77a) and the essence of their prohibition is accepted tradition, and for all of these, a person who does any one of them is liable for lashes for rebelliousness.",

God said, that he who transgresses on the “self-denials” (Leviticus 23:30): ”I will cause tha tperson to perish [from among his people,.” (and see Tractate Yoma 74b – for this Biblical verse deals with doing work on Yom Kippur, and in the Laws of The Resting on the Tenth Day, Chapter 1, Halalkha 4, Maimonides wrote that when it says, “you shall practice self-denial,” it means by implication that this is fasting). And it comes as a received tradition that the matter that the soul depends upon is eating and drinking. But it is appropriate that the king appear handsome (see Tractate Yoma 78b).

                "Remember these general principles and rely upon them, and this is if a person made an inadvertent error regading a positive commandment and/or a negative commendment, or wilfuly violated a positive commandment and did repentence, he is pardoned immediatley. And the repentence is that he will confess on his sin before God and will regret on what he has done and will accpt upon himself that he will not again perform that act. It is stated [in Scripture] reagrding confesson and separation from the sin (Proverbs 28:13): “He who confesses and gives them up will find mercy,” and it is stated regarding remorse/contrition (Jeremiah 31:19): “Now that I have turned back, I am filled with remorse.” But if he violated a negative commandment willfully and did repentence, the repentence is held in suspense and Yom Kippur atones. But if he inadvertently acted regarding [sins whose punishments are] extirpations and death at the hands of the Bet Din/Jewish Court in a matter that requires of him a sin-offering or he committed a sin that requires of it a definite guilt-offering and he brought his sin-offering and/or his guilt-offering and repented, he attains atonement immediately. And it is explained in the Torah that a person who brings his sin offerings requires repentence, as it states (Leviticus 5:5): “he shall confess that wherein he has sinned.” But if he acted willfully regarding [a sin whose punishment] is extirpation or death by the Beth Din and repented, repentence and Yom Kippur hold him in suspense and afflictions cleanse him, and when he dies, his atonement is completed. And all of this occurs if he sinned willingly, but someone who sinned through compulsion is exempt. What are we speaking of? At a time when it is not the Divine Service of the Day of Atonement, but no if he already knows that with the Scapegot he is atoned for all of his sins, as we will explain at the beginning of [Tractate] Shevuot (Chapter 1, Mishna 6)."
