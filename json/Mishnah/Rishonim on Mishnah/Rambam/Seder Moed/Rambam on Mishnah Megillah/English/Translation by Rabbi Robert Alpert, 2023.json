                "It is stated (Esther 9:31): “[These days of Purim shall be observed] at their proper time, [as Mordecai the Jews – and now Queen Esther – has obligated them to do],” the Sages instituted for them many times (Tractate Megillah 2a), and it is stated (Esther 9:19): “That is why village Jews, who live in unwalled towns, observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar,” and since “the village Jews” [observe] on the fourteenth [of Adar], therefore, the people who dwell in walled cities observe on the fifteenth [of Adar]. But if they (i.e., the cities they live in) were walled from the days of Joshua, even though it was destroyed, we are not concerned about this, and reason that they (i.e., the Sages) attached the matter “in cities surrounded by a wall,” as we explained in the Jerusalem Talmud, and they stated to us: “they allotted honor to the Land of Israel that was ruined in those days, and they (i.e., the Sages) attached it in from the days of Joshua the son of Nun. But the people of Shushan read it (i.e., the Megillah) on the fifteenth day [of Adar] even though it is [a] new [place] since the essence of the miracle was performed in it as is explained in the Book of Esther (Esther 9:18): “[But the Jews of Shushan mustered on both the thirteenth and the fourteenth days,] and so rested on the fifteenth.",
                "ויום הכניסה – this is Monday and Thursday because the people of the villages gather on them to hear the Torah scroll [being read] (and Maimonides wrote this in the Laws of Megillah, Chapter 1, Halakha 7, and such has Rabbeinu Hananel explained, but not according to Rashi’s explanation that they come [on Monday and Thursday to court]. But it is prohibited to read the Megillah on Shabbat, and the reason is like we explained regarding the [Sounding of] the Shofar (see Maimonides’ commentary to Tractate Rosh Hashanah, Chapter 4, Mishnah 1) and the [Waving of the] Lulav (Tractate Sukkah, Chapter 4, Mishnah 2 – “lest he remove it four cubits in the public domain and walk toa specialist to learn [how to use it].”). And its (i.e., of the Book of Esther) on different days did not exist other than at the time when our hand was strong and we have the ability to force the complete fulfillment of the commandment, but at this time, meaning to say, from the time that the Talmud was compiled until the Messiah will speedily arrive, we don’t red it other than at its [proper] time and that is the fourteenth day and fifteenth day [of Adar] like we have explained (see also Laws of Megillah Chapter 1, Halakha 9.

But they should not read it on Friday (i.e., the day before the fourteenth of Adar which occurs on Shabbat) because we say since it was advanced, it should be advanced to the [previous] gathering day (see Tractate Megillah 4a)."

And if the Day of Assembly (see Deuteronomy 31:10-13 – which commands the Jewish people to assemble in the Temple courtyard once every seven years to hear the public reading of the book of Deuteronomy during the Festival of Sukkot following the Sabbatical year) falls on Shabbat, the Reading [of the Torah] will be on Sunday. And the time of the priests’ wood-offering, already the marking off of its time was advanced at the end of [Tractate] Taanit (see Chapter 4 Mishnah 5), that if one of those days was on Shabbat, the sacrifice would take place on Sunday.

And what makes the Greek language designated as special from the other language is because it was known among them, for don’t you see that they said [in the Mishnah] above regarding Scrolls that they (i.e., the Rabbis) did not permit that they should be written other than in Greek, and the reason for this is that they translated the Torah in the Greek language for King Talmi (see Tractate Megillah 9a) and that translation was spread until that language (i.e., Greek) became for them like their language, and it is as if it is Asshurit /form of Hebrew (i.e., the language and form of writing that we use today), and similarly, they (i.e., the Rabbis) (see Tractate Megillah 18a) stated the Greek language is fit/appropriate for all, and added to this, that this language was important in their eyes, our Holy Rabbi (Rabbi Judah the Prince) stated, what difference is it to me whether it is the Tarsi language or the Hebrew language or the Greek language (this was the reading of our teacher in Tractate Bava Kamma 83a).

On the third day [of Passover], “Consecrate to Me every first-born” (Exodus 13:1-16). And on the fourth day [of Passover], “If you lend money to My people” (Exodus 22:24-23:19). And on the fifth day [of Passover], “Carve two tablets of stone” (Exodus 34:1-26).

And on the seventh day [of Passover] “Now when Pharaoh let the people go” (Exodus 13:17-15:26). And the Haftarah is “And David spoke to God” (Second Samuel 22:1-51). And on the eighth day [of Passover], “You shall consecrate to the LORD your God all male firstlings” (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17), and the Haftarah is, “This same day at Nob” (Isaiah 10:32-12:6). But on the Sabbath that is within the Festival [of Passover], we read on it from “See, You say to me” (Exodus 33:12-34:26) and the Haftarah is the “Dry Bones” (Ezekiel 37:1-14). And on the first day of Atzeret/Shavuot we read “In the third month” (Exodus 19:1-20:23), and the Haftarah is “In the thirteenth year” (Ezekiel 1:1-28, 3:12). And on the second day [of Shavuot], “You shall consecrate to the LORD your God all male firstlings” (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17) and the Haftarah is “The Prayer of the prophet Habakkuk” (Habakkuk 3:1-19). And on the first day of Rosh Hashanah, “The LORD took note of Sarah as He had promised” (Genesis 21:1-34) and the Haftarah, “There was a man from Ramathaim of the Zuphites” (First Samuel 1:1-2:10). And on the second day [of Rosh Hashanah], “And God put Abraham to the test” (Genesis 22:1-24), and the Haftarah, “The people…found favor in the wilderness (Jeremiah 31:2-20). And on the Fast of Atonement (i.e., Yom Kippur) in the morning, “After the death [of the two sons of Aaron]” (Leviticus 16:1-34) and the Haftarah, “For thus said He who is high aloft” (Isaiah 57:14 – 58:14). And at the Afternoon service, the portion of the forbidden relationships/nakedness (Leviticus 18:1-30), and the Haftarah is the prophecy of [the book of] Jonah (plus Micah 7:18-20).

And on the Shabbat within the Festival [of Sukkot], “See, You say to me,” (Exodus 33:12-34:26), and the Haftarah is “On that day, when Gog sets foot on the soil of Israel” (Ezekiel 38:18-39:16)."

                "The Shabbat that is within Hanukkah, we recite the Haftarah of the candles of Zechariah (Zechariah 2:14-4:7). But if the first day of Hanukkah occurs on Shabbat, so that there will be two Sabbaths of Hanukkah, on the first Sabbath we recite the Haftarah of the candles of Zechariah and on the second [Sabbath], the candles of Solomon (First Kings 7:40-50). And if Purim day occurs on the Sabbath, the Haftarah will be: “I am exacting the penalty for what Amalek did to Israel” (First Samuel 15:2-34) (note: this can only occur in Jerusalem and other walled cities from the time of Joshua son of Nun – as they celebrate Purim on 15 Adar). And similarly, if Rosh Hodesh occurs on the Sabbath day, we recite the Haftarah, “And new moon after new moon” (Isaiah 66:1-24). But if Rosh Hodesh was on Sunday, we recite the Haftarah of “Tomorrow will be the New Moon” (First Samuel 20:18-42). This is the matter that it (i.e., the Mishnah) spoke of (in Mishnah 5 of this chapter): “For all these they break off (i.e., from the ordinary set order of the readings are interrupted, for the Haftarot) for New Moons, for Hanukkah and for Purim.” And similarly, for fast days and the non-priestly watches (which correspond to the priestly watches – the entire Jewish people was divided into twenty-four non-priestly watches, and each time a priestly watch went to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices, part of the corresponding “Ma’amad”/non-priestly watch would go there as well. The remainder of the “watch” would remain at home, and would fast each day from Monday to Thursday, read special portions from the Torah and recite special prayers), they would recite the Haftarah from the matter of the fast but the non-priestly watch would not [recite a special Haftarah] of the order of that Shabbat. For on Tisha B’Av/Ninth of Av, they read [in the Torah) “When you have begotten children” (Deuteronomy 4:25-40) and recite the Haftarah “I will make an end of them – [declares the LORD]” (Jeremiah 8:13-9:23). And The people had the practice during the time of this exile to read the Haftarot prior to Tisha B’av from the subject matter of the Rebukes/Admonitions not from the matter of the [Torah] portions. And similarly, after Tisha B’Av we recite Haftarot of Consolation until the Sabbath before Rosh Hashanah and we recite the Haftarah from the subject of Repentance. And the Haftarot that we recite before Tisha B’Av are: “The words of Jeremiah” (Jeremiah 1:1-2:3), “The Vision of Isaiah” (Isaiah 1:1-20), [and] “Alas she has become a harlot,” (Isaiah 21-27) (but as Kapach notes, that when Maimonides mentioned the order of the Haftarot at the conclusion of Sefer Ahavah in the Mishneh Torah, he switched these Haftarot according to our current practice: a) Jeremiah 1:1-2:3, Jeremiah 2:4-28 – “Hear the word of the LORD” and the “Vision of Isaiah” (Isaiah 1:1-27). And after it (i.e., Tisha B’Av), we read, “Comfort, Oh Comfort My People” (Isaiah 40:1-26), “Zion says, The LORD has forsaken me,” (Isaiah 49:14—51:3), “Unhappy, storm-tossed one, uncomforted!” (Isaiah 54:11-55:5), “I, I am He who comforts you!” (Isaiah 51:15-52:12), “Shout O barren one, You who have bore no child” (Isaiah 54:1-10), “Arise, shine for your light has dawned\" (Isaiah 60:1-22), “I greatly rejoice in the LORD” (Isaiah 61:10-63:9), “Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God” (Hosea 14:2-10, Joel 2:15-27, Micah 7:18-20).

And we recite three blessings before it (i.e., the Reading of the Megillah): “on the reading of the Megillah,” “that God has performed miracles” and “Shehekheyanu”/who has kept us in life, sustained us, etc. And they had the practice to recite the blessing after the reading: “Who does champion our cause,” etc. And remember these general principles: And they are – that we don’t read in public less than ten Biblical verses (see Tractate Megillah 21b). And we do not have less than three people read from a Torah scroll in public. And one person does not read in a Torah scroll less than three verses, and therefore, when we read thirteen verses, one of them reads four verses. And we don’t begin a portion with less than three verses, and then it is permitted to him to stop the reading and to go down. And There should not remain in a portion less than three verses and then it would be permitted for him to stop. All of these general principles are regarding public reading. And a person who begins in the reading of the Torah scroll is obliged to bless, “who has chosen us from all the nations and given us His Torah. [Praised are You, O LORD] who has given us the Torah. And the person who reads last and completes it (i.e., the reading) blesses after it: “who has given us a Torah of truth and planted eternal life in our midst. [Praised are You, O LORD] who has given us the Torah. But they established now that each person recites the blessings [both] before and after because of those who enter [late] and because of those who depart/leave [early] to the synagogue, who did not see that person who made the blessing initially, and when they would see one after another ascend and read without a blessing, they would think that a person reading the Torah does not have to make the blessing beforehand, and if those present there saw the first person who descended and did not make a blessing and they left and did not see the last person who made the blessing afterwards would think that there is no obligation for a blessing after the reading of the Torah (see Tractate Megillah 21b – Kapach did not supply this source)."
