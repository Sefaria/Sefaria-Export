But when one empties libation wine from a small utensil that does not produce other than a drop at a time, and it fell into permitted wine, even all day long, we say that which comes out first is annulled. But if he emptied something permitted into something prohibited, all that which he emptied from it into the prohibited substance is prohibited, and even from a full cask into one drop. But the conclusion of the matter according to the Halakha regarding all the prohibitions in the Torah whether of their own kind or not of their own kind is concerned with the imparting of a taste except for the cases of eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts and libation wine with their own kind with any [miniscule amount] and not of their own kind with the imparting of a taste. Libation wine is because of the stringency regarding idolatry. Cases of eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts because as it is made permitted, so is its prohibition, like the case of one [sheaf of] wheat exempts the pile, so too, one [sheaf of] wheat makes the entire pile forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts. But if a prohibition from the rest of the prohibitions was mixed with something permitted- if something of one species was mixed with something that was not of its species for one could establish by taste if it is priest’s due/Terumah that was combined with non-holy produce/Hullin, a Kohen could taste it, and if it is a prohibited substance, a non-Jewish baker can taste it and if he says that in this mixture there isn’t the taste of Terumah or the taste of something prohibited, it is all permitted. But if something of one species was mixed with something of the same species where one cannot establish the taste, or something of one species [being mixed] with something of a different species and there is no Kohen or non-Jew present that we can rely upon him, if it is something prohibited from forbidden fats, from the blood of something that died of itself or torn, forbidden animals or reptiles (i.e., all kinds of forbidden foods) and similar things, we estimate it with sixty [parts], for if there are sixty parts of permitted substance in opposition to the prohibited substance, it is all permissible, but if not, it is all prohibited. But, if the prohibition is Terumah/priest’s due, Hallah and First Fruits/Bikkurim, we estimate/calculate it with one hundred [parts] of something permitted.
