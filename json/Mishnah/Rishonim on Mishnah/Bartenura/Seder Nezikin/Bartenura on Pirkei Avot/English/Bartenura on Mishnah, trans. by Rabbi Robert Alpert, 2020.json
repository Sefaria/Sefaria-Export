And they were called the Great Assembly, because they returned the crown [of the Torah] to its former greatness (Talmud Yoma 89b), for Moses had said (Deuteronomy 10:17): “The great, mighty and awesome God”, but Jeremiah and Daniel came and said that we don’t say “the mighty and awesome,” but they (i.e., the Men of the Great Assembly) restored it as it was at first, since they said, these are God’s mighty [acts] and these are God’s awesome, for where it not so, how would a nation like this would be able to be established in the face of several nations.",
