                "Mishna: \"From the time that the Priests enter to eat their Terumah (heave offering).\" -----(Bartenura): Priests that have become ritually impure and have immersed (in a ritual bath), are not able to eat [with(lit.)] terumah until \"the sun has set\", which (in actuality) denotes the coming out of the stars. And the reason why (the Mishna) did not write \"...from the time of the coming out of the stars\", was to teach something incidentally; that if the priests became ritually impure with a form of impurity in which their purification requires a sacrifice, for example a Zav (emission) or Metzorah (skin affliction), the atonement (i.e. sacrifice) does not prevent them from eating Terumah, as it is written: \"and the sun set and he is pure, and after he will eat from the sanctified food (Leviticus 22:7)\". (It is) The setting of the sun which prevents eating of Terumah, and his atonement (i.e. sacrifice) does not prevent from eating of Terumah etc.",
                "Mishna: \"Until the end of the first watch\" ----- (Bartenura): Which is the first third of the night, since the night is divided into 3 watches. And from then (end of the first watch) and onward it is not referred to as the time of reciting the Shema of \"with laying down\" (i.e. Shema of nighttime), and it is not called with your \"laying down.\" And before (the time of) the coming out of the stars is also daytime, and not the time of \"laying down.\" And those who rush forward and recite the Shema of nighttime while it is still day, rely on that which was stated by Rabbi Judah, later, in the chapter of Tefillat HaShachar (Morning Prayer), that the Afternoon Prayer (may be recited) until Plag HaMincha (division of afternoon), which is an hour and a quarter before nighttime. Thus it has been established \"that one that performs in accordance of Rabbi Judah has indeed performed\", and immediately at the completion of the time for the afternoon prayer, the time of the recitation of the Shema of nighttime begins....",
                "Mishna: \"Until the coming up of the dawn\" ----(Bartenura): Since the entire night is referred to as the \"time of laying down.\" The law is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel, for the Sages are also in agreement with him, and they do not state \"until midnight\" but only to distance Man from sin. Nevertheless, ideally at the arrival of the time (season lit.) of the recitation of the Shema of nightime of the Mishna, namely from the coming out of the stars, it is forbidden to conduct a meal, and how much more so to sleep, until one has recited the Shema and prayed. ",
                "Mishna: \"It once happened that his [Rabban Gamliel’s] sons came from a house of feasting\" ----(Bartenura): The sons of Rabban Gamliel, having learned the opinion of the Sages (that one may say the Shema) \"until midnight\", said to him (their father), \"That which the Sages disagree with you, do they literally mean (one may recite the Shema) 'until midnight' and no later, and (this is the final ruling based on the rule of) 'The Opinion of the Individual, vs The Opinion of the Many, The Ruling goes according to the Opinion of the Many'? Or, do the Sages agree with your opinion (i.e. until the break of dawn), however, they said (one may recite the Shema) 'until midnight' in order to distance a person from transgression? Rabban Gamliel replied to them, \"The Sages agree with my opinion (i.e. until the break of dawn), and only said 'until midnight' in order to distance a person from transgression. Therefore you are required to recite (the Shema).\"",

The time for Krias Shema is always until a quarter into the day, whether the days are long or short. This is [the understanding] also when it says \"The morning prayer is until four hours into the day\". That is to say, until a third into the day. It uses the term \"four hours\" because a third into the day is four hours into the day on days with equal daytime and nighttime. On any occasion in which the Mishna mentions an amount of hours into the day, one must calculate in this way (I.e calculate what portion of the day these hours would constitute on a day with equal daytime and nighttime. That portion is the relevant factor for all days.) This is how I have understood from the commentaries of Rambam and how I have received [the tradition]. And the reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua who said until three hours, is that this is the way of princes, who don't get up from bed until the end of the third hour. And Hashem said [in the Torah] \"and when you get up\", that is, until the time when all people get up from bed. The ruling is like Rabbi Yehoshua.
