                "הקלין שבדמאי – that the Sages were lenient with regard to these produce which are mentioned in our Mishnah to not tithe what is doubtfully tithed, because their presumption is that they come from that which is ownerless because they are not important and they have two aspects of doubtfulness: there is a doubt that they come from that which is ownerless and they are exempt from the tithes. And even if you can say that they come from what is guarded and are liable for tithes perhaps they were tithed. Butדמאי /doubtfully tithed produce are the grain and the fruit that are taken from those who are not observing certain religious customs regarding tithes for they are suspect on tithing. But a חבר/member of the order for the observance of Levitical laws in daily intercourse who purchases produce from those who are not observing certain religious customs regarding tithes/עמי הארץ must separate from them only the heave-offering of the tithe and the Second Tithe if it is the year of the Second Tithe (i.e., years 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the seven-year cycle), but [regarding] תרומה גדולה/the Great Tithe (i.e., two percent) those who are not observing certain religious customs regarding tithes are not suspected [of violating] because it [is punishable] by death, and there is no limit/definite quantity or size that one piece of wheat can exempt all of the pile and everyone is careful concerning it. But First Tithe and the Tithe of the Poor there is no need to remove from that which is doubtfully tithed even though those who do not observe certain religious customs regarding tithes are suspected of [not observing] them, because the owner of the produce can say to the Levite or to the poor person who come to take the tithes: “bring proof that this produce is tithed and take it,” for we hold in every place (see Tractate Bava Kamma, Chapter 3, Mishnah 11): “He who wants to exact [compensation] from his fellow bears the burden of proof.” But [regarding] the heave-offering of the tithe, one doesn’t say this, for a person who eats produce that is forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts that were not separated from it is liable for death and because of the prohibition, we separate out for the heave-offering of the tithe, and also Second Tithe in order that they will not consume it in a state of ritual impurity, or that they should not eat it outside of Jerusalem.",

But if the [First] Tithe did not become combined with eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts/טבל, he would not separate any other than ten [parts] for the heave-offering of the tithe that are within it – [but] now that they had become mixed up with the eatables that are forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts, he separates eleven [parts] minus a tenth, it is found that he loses one [part] less a tenth.",
                "מאה חולין מתוקנין ומאה מעשר – First [Tithe] from which the heave-offering/תרומה had not been separated out [for the Levite] that had become combined, he takes one-hundred parts for the sake of First Tithe in order to separate from them ten [parts] for the heave-offering of the tithe [that the Levite gives to the Kohen] that is in them and ten [parts] he takes from the one-hundred of unconsecrated produce that is legally fit for use following the separation of priestly dues as if they were First Tithe, for ten [parts] are for the heave-offering of the tithe and it is found that he loses ten [parts]. But, that we are not so stringent when they become combined with eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts/טבל to oblige separating from the eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts ten [parts] for the heave-offering of the tithe like the one-hundred of [First] Tithe, because of this is the law for every thing that becomes mixed that it returns to be like it was at its beginning therefore, the [First] Tithe returns to become like eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts but the טבל /eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts does not return to become like [First] Tithe.",
                "מאה טבל ותשעים מעשר וכו' לא הפסיד כלום – for since there is are in the טבל /eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts ten extra, we judge it as if it has provision from another place. And all eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts that became mixed with unconsecrated produce, if there are other eatables that are forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts/טבלים that he can separate on this mixture from another place, he does not separate other than according to the calculation of the eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts alone. But here, when the טבל/eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts is greater by ten on [the First Tithe] we calculate as if they are from another place and one separates from them according to the calculation of eatables forbidden pending the separation of sacred gifts/טבל alone, and he doesn’t lose anything.",

But for what reason does he take in a diagonal line and he doesn’t take from one entire row straight from east to west or from north to south? For when he takes in a diagonal line, whether one counts all the entire rows from east to west or whether that he counts them from north to south, it is found that he takes one earthen jug [of wine] from each and every row, what is not the case if he were to take one row the length of from east to west or from north to south."
