                "חמשה דברים חייבים בחלה – We draw a conclusion by analogy of [the word] חלה from [the word] \"פסח\"/Passover. It is stated concerning “Passover” the commandment of the bread of affliction (Deuteronomy 16:3): “[You shall not eat anything leavened with it;] for seven days thereafter, you shall eat unleavened bread, bread of distress – [for you departed from the land of Egypt hastily – so that you may remember the day of your departure from the land of Egypt as long as you live].” And it is stated [the word] \"לחם\" /”bread,” with regard to Hallah (Numbers 15:19): “And you eat of the bread of the land…” Just as “bread” that is stated on Passover, a matter that comes to be leavened/soured, so too “bread” that is mentioned with Hallah- something that comes to be leavened/soured and you have nothing that comes to be leavened/soured other than only these five species.",

And barley combines with everything except for wheat, and even though spelt is a species of wheat, it is not specifically a species of wheat, but it is a species of barley and even a kind of wheat that combines with wheat and barley. But the Jerusalem Talmud implies that if they (i.e., the five species) were kneaded together, they would combine even for a species with something that is not of the same species. But if they were not kneaded together but rather that afterwards, the doughs came in contact with/touched each other, one species with something of its own kind combine; but with something of a different species, they do not combine [to make definite quantity of started dough required to separate Hallah].",

And you bring [the analogy] of: ראשית, ראשית\" / “first,” “first” from Hallah.
