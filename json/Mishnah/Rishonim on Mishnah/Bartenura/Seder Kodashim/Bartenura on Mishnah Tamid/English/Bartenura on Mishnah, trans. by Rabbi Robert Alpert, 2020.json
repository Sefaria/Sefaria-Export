But even though it is written (Exodus 30:7) “when he tends the lamps,” that there is no tending less than “two,” this is more preferable that he didn’t tend to other than one light/candle from the two eastern candles/lights/lamps and to leave the second lamp/candle/light burning so that he would not tend to it until the evening, in order to publicize the miracle that he always kindles. But if even that he tends five [lights/candles/lamps] that are on the western side of first, and not the five of the eastern side anad at the end the two of the western side, and from them, he would have to kindle, but he doesn’t do this because it is written (Leviticus 24:2-3): “for kindling lamps regularly. [Aaron shall set them up in the Tent of Meeting] outside the curtain of the Pact [to burn] from evening to morning before the LORD regularly,” the Torah stated, set up a fixed lamp/candle/light to kindle from it all the rest of the candles, and which is this? The second candle/light/lamp of the eastern side, for when he ascends in the hall of the golden altar, it is that candle/lamp/light that he approaches first, but we don’t forgo the occasion to perform a religious act, but one could say that in this, the miracle was established and it was fixed to kindle from it. But, with the first light/lamp/candle, it is impossible, for behold it is written (ibid.,): “before the LORD”, from that candle of the side of God’s presence, which is the the western side, but the first candle/lamp/light is not called, “before the LORD.”",

But at the time of the offering of the incense of Yom Kippur, they would not leave other than from the hall containing the golden altar, because the incense of Yom Kippur was not outside in the hall of the golden altar on the golden altar, but rather in the innermost section in the house of the Holy of Holies, therefore, there is no need that they should leave from between the Entrance hall and the altar, other than from the hall of the golden altar alone."
