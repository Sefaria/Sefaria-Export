But one cannot wonder/be amazed how the the lower beam was that everything leaned upon them was only one cubit thick, for the upper beams that do not handle a burden on this was two cubits thick, because the lower beam , since it was wider in thickness by a cubit was strong and healthy and could receive the building that was upon it, but the upper beams that were not wider than a handbreadth or less, need to be of greater thickness. Alternatively the upper beams were two cubits thick in order to distance the ceiling from the lower beam, because it was embroidered with nice embroidery, and if the ceiling was near it, the embroidery would not be seen and recognized so much.",
