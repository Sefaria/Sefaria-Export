For Scripture stated (Deuteronomy 23:24): “You must fulfill what has cross your lips and perform what you have voluntarily vowed to the LORD your God, [having made the promise with your own mouth];” if it is a voluntary [gift], it is now a vow, and if it is vow, it is not a voluntary [gift], but rather, this is what he said: if according to what you have vowed you have performed, that it was slaughtered for the sake of a vow and for the sake of the owners, it will be a votive offering, and the owner has fulfilled the obligation of his vow. But if not, that the sacrifice was slaughtered for the sake of the owners, it will be a free-will offering, meaning to say, that it is fit, as if he brought it as a free-will offering. But, he did not fulfill his vow, for it did not count for the owners for the sake of an obligation. And especially the sacrifice of an individual which has owners, but communal sacrifices that were not offered for their sake, they counted for the community for the sake of the obligation, for the slaughter decides the purpose for what they are appropriate for him. And especially when he slaughtered them explicitly not for their sake, then we say that they did not count for the owners for he sake of an obligation, But if he merely slaughtered them, they counted for the owners for an obligation.",

But the guilt offering, that doesn’t have an exclusion written concerning I is fit. But if you waya that regarding the guilt offering it is written that it is “a reparation offering” (Leviticus 7:5). But, it is not stated other than after the offering of those portions of the sacrifice on the altar, abut if he comes to exclude that which is not for its own sake that it is invalid, prior to the offering of the parts of the sacrifice on the altar, it should have been written [in the Torah].

And all the time that the altar is defective, all of the Holy Things that are ritually slaughtered in the Temple courtyard are all invalidated, as it is written (Exodus 20:21): “[Make for Me an altar of earth] and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your sacrifices of well-being,” and it is impossible to state this Scriptural verse as it implies, for the ritual slaughter of Holy Things [takes place] in the Temple courtyard and not on the altar, other than upon it, that is to say, whenever it is complete/whole, you sacrifice but you do not sacrifice when it is defective. And all of the Holy Things that are found in the Temple courtyard at the time that the altar is defective, even though they were ritually slaughtered in a fit manner, all of them are invalid. And even the residue of the meal-offerings are not consumed, as it is written (Leviticus 10:12): “[Moses spoke to Aaron and to his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar: take the grain that is left over from the LORD’s gifts] and eat it unleavened beside the altar,” on the basis of a tradition we learned that at the time that the altar is whole/complete and not at the time when it is defective."

And there is one [opinion] that states that scouring and rinsing, both of them are done in cold water after the cleansing of impure vessels in hot water, as it is taught in the Mishnah shortly nearby (i.e., at the conclusion of our Mishnah), but that scouring is like scouring of a cup and rinsing is like the rinsing of the cup, that the one is from the outside and the other is from the inside, that is to say, rinsing is done from the outside and scouring is done from the inside.

But if it (i.e., the Mishnah) mentioned only turtle-doves and pigeons, because they were not appropriate/eligible and superseded, I would say that Rabbi Shimon agrees with the Rabbis.
