                " ... 6) Rebbi says: Since it says 'mincha [shel esronim],' it means he specified one [amount]. Perhaps he specified to bring a mincha of one issaron; if he brings 60 issaron in place of [lit. 'in the vessel of] one issaron, it could be an extraneous mincha. Rebbi is of the opinion that since he specified exaclt how big the mincha will be, [he must bring that exact one], therefore he must bring 60 menachot from 1 through 60, one of 1 issaron, one of two issarons, one of three, one of four, until 60. He will find himself bringing in total 1830 issaron of flour, and for certain one of them will fulfill his vow, and it is not a Nedava. The halacha is not according to Rebbi. [If you specified, and forget what you specified, you bring only a 60 issaron mincha.]"
