                "כשרות – and he offers the incense of the fistful [of the meal-offering] and its residue is consumed [by the Kohanim]. For the fistful of the meal-offering stands in place of the ritual slaughter of the sacrifice. And just as regarding all of the animal offerings that were slaughtered not for their own sake are kosher/fit, as we derive from a Biblical verse at the beginning of Tractate Zevakhim (i.e., see Deuteronomy 23:24), here also, all the meal-offerings that are fistfuls which were gathered not for their own sakes are kosher/fit.",

For if they took fistfuls that were not for their sake, as for example, for the purpose of a free-will offering, or he gave the handful in sacred vessels that were not for this purpose, or he walked or offered incense not for its sake/name, or he had in mind one of these forms of Divine Service: “I am serving for their sakes/name or not for their sakes/name.” These meal-offerings are invalid and their residues/remnants are not consumed. And the reason is because the All-Merciful calls the sin’s meal offering a sin-offering, and regarding a sin-offering, it is written (Leviticus 4:33): “[He shall lay his hand upon the head of the purification offering,] and it shall be slaughtered as a purification offering (i.e., sin-offering)/ושחט אותה לחטאת [at the spot where the burnt offering is slaughter],” (Leviticus 4:34): “and [the priest] shall take [with his finger] some of the blood of the purification offering,” so that the ritual slaughtering and the taking, that is the receiving of the blood will be for the sake of the sin-offering. But the meal offering of jealousy, since it is written concerning it \"עון\"/wrongdoing [as in] (Numbers 5:15): “a grain-offering of remembrance which recalls wrongdoing,” the Rabbis compare it to the sin-offering. And the meal-offering of the Omer, even though it is not a sinner’s meal-offering and is not the meal offering of jealousy, if a handful was taken not for its sake/name, it is invalidated from being offered up as incense, and none of its residue is consumed, since it came to permit the new [grain] crop [that ripened before Passover], and it did not permit it. But all of the meal-offerings that were grasped [from the grain] not for its sake/name are kosher, as is taught in our Mishnah, we are speaking especially with meal-offerings that don’t have a fixed time, but not of the meal-offering of the Omer that [the Torah] established a fixed time for it.",
                "או שלא לשמן ולשמן – that you should not say for their sakes/name and not for their sakes/name that it is invalidated, for the latter language takes effect, but [both] not for their sakes/name and for their sakes/name are kosher/fit, this is what it comes to tell us."

And this he had to do with meal-offerings prepared in a pan (i.e., fried in a flat pan) or [a meal-offering] prepared in a deep pan (i.e., fried in a container full of oil) that their creations are baked and after they their baking, he crumbles it and takes a fistful. But it is impossible to crumble it so much into thin pieces, for they would not go forth from the fistful, therefore, he smooths them with his thumb from above and with the small finger (i.e., pinky) from below. And these were of the most difficult [acts] of Divine service that were in the Temple. That in this great difficulty one is able to compare that he would not be missing or have too much. And Maimonides wrote, that the words of the one of said that this is a difficult [act] of Divine Service were set aside, and he explains and he takes a fistful of the meal-offering as people would take fistfuls that is mentioned in the Gemara [i.e., Tractate Menahot 11a], that he fills his palm from it in the manner that people fill their hands from what they take in their hands. But I say, that that the explanation is not as how people take a fistful [of meal-offering] but rather, causes the sides of his fingers to enter into the flour that he brings in the flour with the sides of his fingers into his hand, but he doesn’t take the flour but rather fills three of his fingers until the palm of his hand and not further, in order that it will be cutting through from end to end and burst forth and come out, he smooths it from below with his small finger (i.e., pinky) and from above with a thumb. And that the words of the one who said that this is a difficult act from the difficult acts of Divine Service that is in the Temple are not set aside and the method of the Gemara is like m words.

Wasn’t it already mentioned above in the portion (verse 4): “and the other lamb you shall offer it [at twilight]?” Because it states with it, “you shall offer one lamb in the morning,” behold that he did not offer up the one for the morning, I hear that he did not offer it up at twilight, the inference teaches us the latter verse (Numbers 28:8): “The other lamb you shall offer at twilight,” but if they deliberately [did not offer the lamb in the morning], he should not offer it at twilight, those who act deliberately, but other Kohanim are able to offer it.",

But if he did not do the candle lighting in the evening, why does he need to repair it in the morning, so we see that the dedication of the Menorah is at twilight. And since the Menorah was dedicated in the evening, the incense is also dedicated in the evening, as it is written (Exodus 30:8): “And Aaron shall burn it at twilight when he lights the lamps, [- a regular incense offering before the LORD throughout the ages].”"

And similarly, we found in the Book of Joshua (5:11): “On the day after the Passover offering, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the country, unleavened bread and parched grain,” for behold it states in the Torah (Leviticus 23:14): “Until that very day, [until you have brought the offering of your God], you shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears,” but from after that it held in suspense the permission of the new grain on the aftermath [of the first day] of Passover, the matter was clear that the aftermath of [the first day of] Passover is what permits the new grain and on it, they reap the Omer whether the first Holy Day of Passover occurs on a weekday or whether it occurs on the Sabbath. And therefore, the reapers raise their voices in order that the Boethusians will hear it and to remove it (i.e., the practice of waiting until the Saturday night after the holiday) from their hearts. And they reap the Omer at night and not during the day, as it is written (Leviticus 23:15): “And from the day on which you bring the sheaf of elevation offering – the day after the sabbath – you shall count off seven weeks. They must be complete,” and it is impossible to be “complete” unless one begins to count from the beginning of the nighttime, for the nighttime is the beginning of the day, and behold it states (Deuteronomy 16:9): “start to count the seven weeks when the sickle is first put to the standing grain,” so we see that the reaping is at night at the time when they begin to count."

                "בבית חוניו – The Temple that Khonyo, the son of Shimon HaTzaddik built in Alexandria of Egypt. For when Shimon HaTzaddik (see Tractate Avot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 2 – one of the last of the generation of the Great Assembly who stated that the world stands on three “pillars”: Torah, Divine Service and Deeds of Loving Kindness) [was about] to die (see the Baraita in Tractate Menahot 109b), he said to them (i.e., his sons): Khonyo, my son will serve in my place, because he is an expert and familiar with the Divine Service more than Shimei his brother. But Khonyo did not accept upon himself to become the High Priest because Shimei his brother was two and half years older than him. And Shimei was appointed as High Priest in place of his father. Subsequently, Khonyo became jealous of Shimei his brother, he (i.e., Shimei) said to him: “Come and I will teach you the order/arrangement of the Divine Service. He dressed him in a thin, fine linen shirt/undercoat, that women wear upon their flesh and upon it a small, narrow belt/girdle and he placed him near the Altar; he went and said to his brethren the Kohanim: “See what this person vowed and fulfilled to his beloved,” that day when I will be appointed to be High Priest, I will wear your fine linen shirt and I will gird myself with your belt/girdle. His brethren the Priests desired to kill him, he recounted to him the entire event, they wished to kill Khonyo, he (i.e., Khonyo) ran from before them to the house of the King. And yet, everyone who sees him states that this is him, he went to Alexandria of Egypt where there were myriads of Jews and made there a Temple and built an altar and offered upon it in the name of God. And regarding that altar Isaiah prophesied (Isaiah 19:19): “In that day, there shall be an altar to the LORD inside the land of Egypt [and a pillar to the LORD at its border].” And this House (i.e., Temple) stood for close to two hundred years and is called “The House of Khonyo” in his name. And everyone agrees that the sacrifices that they would offer there were not a sacrifice. Therefore, whomever said, “May a burnt-offering sacrifice be upon me” – and he offered it there did not fulfill his vow. ",
                "שאקריבנה בבית חוניו – it was made like one who says : “May a burnt-offering sacrifice be upon me on the condition that I will kill it and not be liable for it, therefore if he offered it in the House of Khonyo, he did not fulfill his vow, but he is liable for extirpation because he slaughters outside [the Temple courtyard], for he called upon it the designation of a burnt-offering.",
                "רבי שמעון אומר אין זו עולה – and behold it is completely unconsecrated, for the designation of consecrated does not occur to it at all when he stated that I will offer it in the House of Khonyo. But the Halalkha is not according to Rabbi Shimon.",
                "ואם גלח בבית חוניו לא יצא – but rather, he should return and shave [at the conclusion of his period of Naziriteship] in the Temple in Jerusalem, and there he should bring his sacrifices.",
                "שאגלח בבית חוניו אם גלח בבית חוניו יצא – that this man who took the vow of becoming a Nazirite in order that he could shave in the House of Khonyo, he intended to cause himself suffering, but because he was close to the House of Khonyo and far from the land of Israel, he stated, “If I can [offer it] in the House of Khonyo, I will go to the trouble of doing so. More than that he is not able to cause himself suffering, but the designation of being a Nazirite does not fall upon him but he becomes like a person who took an oath that he would not drink wine until a certain time.",
                "רבי שמעון אומר – He is not a Nazirite at all and is permitted to drink wine. But the Halakha is not according to Rabbi Shimon.",
                "ואין צריך לומר לדבר אחר – if they served for idolatry, they would not serve [as priests] any longer in Jerusalem.",
                "והרי הן כבעלי מומין (see Tractate Zevakhim, Chapter 12, Mishnah 1) – that they take their portions and eat Sacred Things [but do not offer sacrifices]."
