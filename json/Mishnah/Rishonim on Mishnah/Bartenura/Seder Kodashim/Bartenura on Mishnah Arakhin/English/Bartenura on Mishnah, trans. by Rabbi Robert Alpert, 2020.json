And even though it is written (Leviticus 27:2): “[Speak to the Israelite people and say to them:] When anyone explicitly vows/\"איש כי יפלא נדר בערכך\" [to the LORD the equivalent for a human being],” when he is near his period of maturity/adulthood, he is called a man (i.e., an adult) in this matter. And [the word] \"הכל\"/everyone that also refers to [the individual who is] the subject of the valuation, including someone disfigured/disgraced and/or afflicted with boils, who is not worth anything [financially]. For you might think that I would say that a vow of assessment of a person or animal dedicated to the sanctuary, as it is written (Leviticus 27:2 -see above), he whose person has a value, can vow the value of a person or an animal, but he whose person has no value cannot (see Tractate Arakhin 2a), which comes to tell us that [the word] \"הכל\"/everyone that refers to those entitled to dedicate, because it is taken for being dedicated, and those being dedicated is necessary [to teach] to include those who are younger than a month old, which can be dedicated [for a sacrifice] even though they are not the subject of valuation.",

For even if the one who causes damage is liable for indemnity/payment from the Torah, a loan that is written about in the Torah is not equivalent to something written in a document, but it is an oral loan. And an oral loan does not collect from the heirs. But Rabbi Yossi holds, that the loan that is written in the Torah is equivalent to a loan written in a document and he collects from the heirs.

For if there those who desire to sell it, he tells the workers at the time they go out [to work]: “See for me a particular field if it is nice,” and at the time when they go home, when he hears the public announcement, he recalls and goes and asks them. But when they make the announcement, they say: “This particular field – that such-and-such are its signs/marks [of identification], such and such are its pathways, such is how it makes grain and such the Jewish court has provided an estimate of it. And if they sell it for the [payment of] the Ketubah of his wife, they state: “The purchaser will buy it on the condition that he (i.e., the seller) will give the monies for the Ketubah of his wife.” But if they sell it for the creditor, they state: “On the condition that he gives the monies to the creditor.” Because there is a purchaser that it is pleasant for him to purchase it in order to pay the woman that he married bit by bit, and there is a case where it is more pleasant for him to pay the creditor who takes defective and broken Zuzim (i.e., coins), for it is not the manner of merchants to be so exacting in this. But even though we hold that the Jewish court does not require the property of orphans to sell them, and here (i.e., in this Mishnah) it is taught that “[the proclamation of the sale of goods of] orphans evaluated [by the court to meet the father’s debt] is thirty days,” that implies that the Jewish court does sell the property of orphans. But we state that only for three things does the Jewish court need to sell the property of orphans: a heathen creditor that their father owed him, and that interest [payments] eat up [their settlement], and on the Ketubah of a wife because there is ample provision for the orphans when she collects her Ketubah/marital settlement, for all the while that she didn’t collect her Ketubah settlement she has provisions/alimentation from the orphans; once she collects her Ketubah settlement, she no longer has alimentation. And on a debt that their father admitted to/acknowledged at the time of his death that someone has [a claim] of a Maneh, or that the Jewish court excommunicated him on this debt and he died in his being excommunicated, or that the time had not yet arrived at the time of his death for repayment of the debt, for a person does not act in the midst of its time, and when the Jewish court needs the property of the orphans for these things, they appoint for them an administrator (or guardian) and they sell it through public announcement, as is taught in our Mishnah. But these words apply with regard to land, but regarding movables, now that we hold that movables of orphans can be mortgaged to a creditor, the creditor needs to take an oath and collect his lien from the movables and there is no need for public announcement, for we don’t make public announcements on either slaves nor on documents nor on movable properties.",

A person who dedicates his ancestral field in the first year of the jubilee and comes to redeem it, gives fifty Sela for an area requiring a KOR of seed, as it is written (Leviticus 27:16): “fifty shekels of silver to a HOMER of barley seed, etc.” But if he dedicated it ten or twenty years after the Jubilee year, we calculate the remaining years until the coming Jubilee year, and he gives a SELAH and a PUNDIYON for each year, as it is written (Leviticus 27:18): “But if he consecrates his land after the jubilee, the priest shall compute the price according to the years that are left [until the jubilee year], and its assessment shall be reduced,” that is, the deduction [from the price of redemption according to the years of redemption] that he doesn’t give fifty complete [years]. But a person who dedicates [his field] two years before the Jubilee [year], he redeems it for two SELA and two PUNDIYONIM, as it is written (Leviticus 27:18): “according to the years that are left”, and such is the accountability which goes up of the redemption of the ancestral field for each year a SELA and a PUNDIYO, for if he dedicated it in the first year after the Jubilee he would redeem it for fifty shekel, deduct from them the forty-nine coming years until the next Jubilee forty-nine shekel, it is found a Sela for each year and an additional Sela, and this additional Sela is divided into PUNDIYONIM, for in each SELA there are forty- eight PUNDIYONIM, therefore a SELA and a PUNDIYON for each year less a PUNDIYON. And just as they required him to give a SELA and a PUNDIYON for each year, for forty-nine years – forty-nine SELA and forty-nine PUNDIYONIM, and there is here one additional PUNDIYON more than the fifty shekel that the Torah mentioned, that PUNDIYON is agio (an addition) to the units (making fifty, as a round sum, instead of forty-eight – see Tractate Bekhorot 50a), meaning to say for the customary addition weight in retailing that he must give for each and every shekel on its own. Alternatively, even though the Selah is not other than forty-eight Pundiyonot, he is required to give forty nine, which is a Selah and a Pundiyon for forty-nine years, because one who gives Pundiyonim to purchase a Sela from the money-changer gives forty- nine Pundiyonim, and that is an agio (an addition) to the units (making fifty, as a round sum, instead of forty-eight. And the person who dedicates his ancestral field less than two years prior to the Jubilee year, there isn’t deduction from the price of redemption according to the years of possession (see Tractate Arakhin 24a), but if he comes to redeem it, he gives fifty complete [shekels], for concerning deduction, it is written (Leviticus 27:18): “according to the years that are left until the jubilee, and its assessment shall be so reduced,” and the minimum of שנים/years is two years. And it is good advice that our Mishnah teaches us that a person should have consideration for his possessions (see Tractate Negaim, Chapter 12, Mishnah 5) and not dedicate them [to the Temple] less than two years [from the Jubilee year] and not lose forty-eight Sela.",

And what is the reason? Because we don’t calculate months with the Dedication to the Temple. A person who comes to redeem his field five and one-half years before the Jubilee [year], we don’t calculate them as six months that had passed from the sixth year, but rather, he gives six Sela and six Pundiyonim, as it is written (Leviticus 27:18): “the priest shall compute the price according to the years that are left,” years – you calculate, but you don’t calculate months, meaning to say, all that which remains is considered years, to make remaining month a year, but you don not calculate the months that passed, to deduct from the Shekel and Pundiyon for them.",

But this is what he said: he does not redeem like Levites, as it is written concerning them (Leviticus 25:32): “the Levites shall forever have the right of redemption,” but rather like this procedure that is stated regarding an Israelite that it will be permanently sold at the end of a year.",

For he can never redeem like a Levite until he will be a Levite and in a Levitical city. For two Biblical verses are written: It is written (Leviticus 25:33): “for the houses in the cities of the Levities are their holding [among the Israelites],” and it is written (Leviticus 25:33): “Such property as may be redeemed from the Levites,” which implies that for some of the Levities I have given permission to redeem, but not to all of them, excluding the son of Levite who comes from a mother who is illegitimately married to him (i.e., a bastard) or from a female descendant of the Gibeonites (see Joshua 9:27 as well as Tractate Yevamot, Chapter 8 at the conclusion Mishnah 3), and all the more so an Israelite who inherited his mother’s father, a Levite, for he (i.e., the grandson) is a complete Israelite and does not ever redeem [like a Levite].",

If you were to say that it cannot be sold at all, but [it is written] (Leviticus 25:32): “the Levites shall forever have the right of redemption,” it follows that it can [in fact] be sold, but what [is the meaning of] (Leviticus 25:34): “[But the enclosed land about their cities] cannot be sold/לא ימכר ?” It shall not be changed.",
