But that of pericarp does not combine/join together, for again, the globule/stone or kernel of a stone fruit is not a protector of the fruit, for the moisture that is in the date has already ceased and the globule does not protect it so that it doesn’t become lost. Therefore, the membranous enclosure separating the stone of the date from its flesh/pericarp, and it is the membrane/skin that is wrapped and attached on the globule of the date, combines/joins with the date when it is dry, because the membrane/skin is a protector and not the globule/kernel of a stone fruit.",
