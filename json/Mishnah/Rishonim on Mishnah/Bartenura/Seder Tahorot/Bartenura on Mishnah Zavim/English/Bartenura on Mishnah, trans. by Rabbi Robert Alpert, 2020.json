                "בית שמאי אומרים כשומרת יום [כנגד יום] (like a woman who observes a day for a day) – for even though she is not a complete woman who experiences a flow of menstrual-type blood on three consecutive days during a time of the month when she is not due to experience menstrual bleeding until three sightings, nevertheless, with one sighting, she makes a surface designated for lying and sitting ritually impure, just like a person with gonorrhea, even though he does not become a complete person with gonorrhea/flux until three sightings, nevertheless, with one sighting he makes surfaces designated for lying and sitting ritually impure.",

But if he saw three sightings on one day or on three consecutive days, he must count seven clean [days] and he is liable for a sacrifice, as it teaches in a Baraita: Scripture counted two [days] and called him ritually impure, as it is written (Leviticus 15:2): “When any man has a discharge issuing from his member, he is impure”/\"זב מבשרו זובו טמא הוא\"; three [sightings] and he is called impure, (Leviticus 15:3): “The impurity from his discharge shall mean the following – whether his member runs with the discharge or is stopped up so that there is no discharge, his impurity means this:”/ואתה תהיה טומאתו בזובו רר בשרו את-זובו או-החתים בשרו מזובו טמאתו היא.\", how so? Two [sightings] for ritual impurity and three [sightings] for [an obligatory] sacrifice. But a woman who experiences a flow of menstrual-type blood on three consecutive days during a time of the month when she is not due to experience menstrual bleeding/זבה if she saw many sightings on one day or on two days not during the time of her menstrual bleeding, observes one day in cleanliness and she is ritually pure in the evening. But if she saw three sightings [of non-menstrual bleeding] on three consecutive days, she needs to count seven clean days and she is liable for a sacrifice. For concerning a זבה/a woman who experiences a flow of menstrual -type blood on three consecutive days during a time of the month when she is not due to experience menstrual bleeding, it is written (Leviticus 15:25): \"ואשה כי-תזוב [יזוב] דמה ימים רבים בלא עת-נדתה\"/When a woman has had a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her menstrual impurity” (The text of Bartenura “misquotes” the Biblical verse -what is in brackets is what is found in the text of the Torah); [The word] \"ימים\"/days- are two; [the word] \"רבים\" /many – are “three.” Scripture suspends/hangs the man who has gonorrhea through sightings, and the woman who has discharges of blood outside the time of her menstrual impurity through days, and now it states, that if the man who has a flux has three sightings, but that he stopped for one day between the first sighting and the latter two sightings.",

For specifically when the fluxes were not interrupted with three clean days, according to the number of days that makes a person a complete זב, it is this case where the School of Shammai states that the effusion of semen invalidates it, but after three pure days have passed, the School of Shammai agrees that an emission does not invalidate anything other than that day, and in this that one calls that a person with gonorrhea invalidates, one derives from Scripture, as it is written (Leviticus 15:32): “This is the ritual concerning him who has a discharge: concerning him who has an emission of semen and becomes impure thereby.” Just as flux invalidates, even effusion of semen invalidates. If just as a flux invalidates everything, so the effusion of semen invalidates everything, the inference teaches us (Leviticus 15:32): \"לטמאה בה\"/”and become pure thereby,” she only has one day. But if he saw a flux, even on the seventh day, it invalidates what is before it, as it is written (Leviticus 15:13): “[he shall count off] seven days for his purification,” until all seven days would be pure from the discharges."

However, when there is an interruption in-between as the School of Hillel states above (in Tractate Zavim, Chapter 1, Mishnah 2), he is not a complete Zav, and the appearances do not combine, there is no difference regarding the matter of impurity as for example, that he saw two appearances alone with the interruption of the day in-between and there is no difference regarding the matter of a sacrifice, as for example that he saw three appearances [of emissions]."

For if the beginning of twilight is day and the end of twilight is night, we don’t have two appearances [of flux] on two consecutive days, for Shabbat interrupts and there isn’t the defilement of gonorrhea (but rather, like a person with an emission). But if the entire twilight from the day or all of it is from the night, there are two appearances here on two consecutive days, and which require counting seven clean [days] and one is exempt from the sacrifice. But if the beginning of twilight or at its end, half of it is from the day and half of it is from the light, the appearance [of flux] was divided into two and one is required to bring a sacrifice.
