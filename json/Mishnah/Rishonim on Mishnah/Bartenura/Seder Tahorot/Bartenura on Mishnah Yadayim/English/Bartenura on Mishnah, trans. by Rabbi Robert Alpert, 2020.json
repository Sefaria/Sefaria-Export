Even for two [people] if there was in it from the outset a quarter of a LOG and the first [person] poured [water over his hands] and afterwards the second [person], even though there wasn’t a quarter [of a LOG] for the second [person], it is all right, since they come from the remnants of purity (see Talmud Hullin 107a). But Maimonides [brings] an explanation, that specifically it is water for the second pouring [i.e., pouring water on the hands prior to consuming Terumah/heave offering (for a Kohen)] that we don’t we require a quarter of a LOG for each person, since his hands had already been purified from the first rinsing, but the first pouring, there cannot be less than one-quarter of a LOG for each person.

However, if there is one-quarter of a LOG and a half an the first [person] from them poured one-half of one-quarter of a LOG, the remaining one-quarter of a LOG will be sufficient for the two others, for even at the outset, it is enough for two [people] with one-quarter [of a LOG], all the more so now that they come from to leave over/preserve ritual purity.

But on the first waters, if they didn’t reach the joint, he is not able to add, but rather he must dry his hands and return and pour water at once that they should reach the joint."
