                "אבות הטומאה. השרץ – there are eight reptiles that are written in the [Torah] portion of Shemini (Leviticus 11:29-30): החלד/the mole and עכבר/the mouse [and the צב/lizard; the ענקה/gecko; the כח/land crocodile; the לטאה/lizard; the חמט/sand lizard and the תנשמת/chameleon],” they are the primary sources of ritual impurity to defile humans and utensils/vessels that come in contact with them when they are dead. And their measurements for defiling is like that of a lentil (though we are informed in Tractate Kelim, Chapter 17, Mishnah 8, that whenever a lentil is spoken of, it means…the Egyptian lentil). For the sand lizard/חמט at the beginning of its creation is like that of lentil (see Tractate Nazir 52a). But the limbs have no measure, for even less that of a lentil of a reptile defiles (see Tractate Ohalot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 7). And especially when it is moist, the reptile defiles, but it does not defile when dry, as it is written (Leviticus 11:32): “And anything on which one of them falls when dead [shall be impure: be it any article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack – any such article that can be put to use shall be dipped in water, and it shall remain impure until evening; then it shall be pure],” similar to their being dead (see Tractate Niddah 56a).",
                "ושכבת זרע – Specifically the semen of an adult Israelite , but that of a heathen does not defile, even according to the Rabbis, for the nocturnal pollution of a heathen is completely pure. And similarly, the semen of a minor also does not defile, as it is written (Leviticus 15:16): “When a man has an emission of semen, [he shall bathe his whole body in water and remain impure until evening],” a man/איש, but not a minor/קטן who is younger than nine-years and one-day old, for [prior to the age of nine-years and one-day] his act of sexual intercourse is not coition. And its measurement to the observer is a little bit, even similar to a mustard seed, and to contact/touching, like that of a lentil. And specifically moist semen that defiles, as it is written (Leviticus 15:16): “[When a man has] an emission of semen/כי תצא ממנו שכבת זרע,” he who is appropriate for emitting semen, for since the teacher of our Mishnah did not consider a בעל קרי/one who experienced a seminal emission (see Leviticus 15:16-18) as one of the primary sources of defilement, we learn from this that it is none other than first degree of ritual defilement, and this is taught at the conclusion of Tractate Zavim (Chapter 5, Mishnah 11), that a person who experienced a seminal emission is like one who came in contact with a reptile, and is not seen as other than first [degree of ritual defilement].",
                "וטמא מת – a person who became defiled through contact with the dead. But utensils/vessels that came in contact with the dead are like the dead itself, and whatever comes in contact with them is made into a primary source of ritual defilement. But utensils/vessels which came in contact with a person who was defiled through contact with the dead or a person who came in contact with utensils/vessels that had been in contact with the dead, they are primary sources of ritual defilement and are defiled for seven days like a person, as is taught in the Mishnah of the first chapter of Ohalot [Mishnah 2]. But earthenware and foods and liquids that came in contact with the dead do not become primary sources of ritual defilement. And especially an Israelite becomes a primary source of ritual defilement when he touched a dead person. But an idolater and similarly a non-viable birth/premature that was born at the age of a month is not susceptible to become ritually impure if he came in contact with the dead.",
                "ומצורע בימי ספרו – A confirmed leper (declared ritually impure by a Kohen. All the laws applying to a quarantined leper apply to a confirmed leper – who must grow his hair long and rend his garments; to purify himself when healed, he must shave all his hair, and bring a special purification offering) and who is fitted for Levitical uncleanness with [his bringing] [two] birds, and cedar wood and hyssop and two scarlet-dyed yarn and shaving, and he sits from outside his tent for seven days and one the eighth [day] brings his sacrifices (see Leviticus 14:8), and on those seven days are called the days of his counting, and he defiles humans, and it is stated “the washing of his clothing “ (“The one to be purified shall was his clothing” – Leviticus 14:8) on the day of final decision [by a Kohen] and it is stated, “the washing of his clothes” on the days of his counting (Leviticus 14:9: “[On the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair…]he shall wash his clothes [and bathe his body in water; then he shall be pure],” just as there he defiles a human being, so here [also] he defiles a human being.",
                "ומי חטאת שאין בהם כדי הזייה – defiles him through contact. But if they have enough in order to sprinkle [of the water of the purification upon the unclean] it defiles even through carrying, to defile humans and clothing, as it is written (Numbers 19:21): “Further, he who sprinkled the water of lustration shall wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water of lustration shall be impure until evening.” But our Rabbis/teachers learned that the person who sprinkles is pure, and the Biblical verse does not come other than to give a measure to the person carrying [the waters of the sin-offering of the Red Heifer] that there must be enough for sprinkling , and the Biblical verse divided between the two kinds of water, to inform you that water where there is enough for sprinkling defiles a person to defile clothing, but where there isn’t enough [water] for sprinkling, it defiles a person to defile food and liquids but not to defile clothing.",
                "וכלי חרס באויר – when his defilement fell in the airspace of an earthenware vessel, whether it touched ,the vessel or whether it did not touch it, the vessel is defiled. But if it the defilement touched the vessel from the outside, it was not defiled by this contact, as it is written (Leviticus 11:33): “And if any of those (i.e., an article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack) falls into an earthen vessel, everything inside it shall be impure [and the vessel itself you shall break],” from inside it/within it, it becomes defiled, but it is not defiled from outside of it.",
                "ואינם מטמאין במשא – that all of these primary sources of ritual defilement that are considered here are written concerning them \"הנוגע\"/someone who comes in contact with them and it is not written: \"הנושא\"/he who carries them."
            ],
            [
                "מטמאים את האדם במשא – when he lifts one of them whether by his hand or his fellow lifts it upon his shoulder, and even if he [himself] did not make contact with the defiling substance, or that the defiling substance was tied with a rope and the defiling agent was lifted via the rope. Since he moved the weight of the impure thing on his own, the person is defiled by ritual impurity imparted by carrying [even when not touching them directly] to defile the clothing that is upon him, or all of the garments/clothing and vessels/utensils that he comes in contact with, except for earthenware, all the while that the defiling matter is upon his back. But after he withdrew from the defilement, he does not defile utensils/vessels through touching/contact, for whomever carries the defilement, after he has withdrawn from it is not ought but first degree of ritual impurity, but utensils/vessels do not become susceptible to receive defilement other than from a primary source of ritual impurity. But even at the time that he carries the defilement, he does not defile humans nor earthenware vessels, but rather only other utensils/vessels. And you do not have something that is defiled with ritual impurity imparted by carrying other than a human being alone, but not utensils/vessels and not food and liquids, for if there were may utensils/vessels one on top of the other and a carrion or the waters of lustration in the upper-most vessel, the lower vessels are not defiled by carrying all the while that they did not touch/come in contact with the carrion or with the waters of lustration. And similarly, food and liquids are not defiled with the ritual impurity imparted by carrying, for concerning the ritual impurity imparted by carrying, it is written \"לכם\" (see Leviticus 11:39: “If an animal that you may eat has died/וכי ימות מן-הבהמה אשר-היא לכם לאכלה [anyone who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening]),” and we expound [the word] \"לכם\"/that you – that they defile through carrying but they do not defile vessels nor foods and liquids through carrying. And just as carrion defiles through carrying, so it also defiles through movement/ היסט (i.e., by means of a lever, without actually coming in contact with it – and this applies to impurity imparted by someone with gonorrhea, a woman in flux, a menstruating woman or a woman after childbirth), for movement is from the category/species of carrying, as for example, that there was wood placed at the tope of a tree or at the top of a wall and a carrion was at one end of the wood and a person comes and puts the knee of the balance down on the second/opposite end, since he lifted the end on which the carrion on is on account of his additional weight, it is defiled with the ritual impurity of movement, which is like carrying.",
                "וחשוכי בגדים במגע (and to make unclean the persons alone but not their clothes) – meaning to say, the clothes are prevented from defilement if there is contact without carrying, for the person who comes in contact/touches the carrion or the waters of lustration but does not carry them does not defile even the clothing that is upon him, as it written (Leviticus 11:39, though this verse, which is brought by the commentary of Rabbi Pinchas Kahati on this Mishnah does NOT exactly express what Bartenura writes – perhaps he is referring to Leviticus 11:27): “anyone who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening” (and see verse 27: “whoever touches their carcasses/הנוגע בנבלתם shall be impure until evening. [They are impure for you/טמאים המה לכם”), and the washing of clothing is not mentioned there, and with the waters of lustration, it is also written (Numbers 19:21 – and this verse does not match the Hebrew text brought by the Bartenura commentary, but is also referred to by the commentary of Rabbi Pinchas Kahati where he mentions that in both places, the washing of clothing is not mentioned: “Whatever that impure person touches shall be impure until evening/והנוגע במי הנדה יטמא עד-הערב”. On the other hand, use of the Bar Ilan Responsa project takes the reader to Numbers 31:24: “On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes and be pure, and after that you may enter the camp.”). [The word] חשוכי – is the language of prevention, like (Genesis 22:16): “Because [you have done this] and have not withheld your son/ולא חשכת את-בנך, [your favored one].”"

                "בועל נדה – It is written concerning them (Leviticus 15:24): “[And if a man lies with her,] her menstrual impurity is communicated to him/ותהי נדתה עליו; [he shall be impure seven days, and any bedding on which he lies shall become impure],” we learned that he, like a menstruating woman, defiles surfaces designated for lying and sitting, and it is written after this (Leviticus 15:24): “and any bedding on which he lies shall become impure/כל משכב אשר-ישכב עליו יטמא,” but it is not necessary to state this, but rather it comes to explain, “her menstrual impurity is communicated to him,” of the first clause [of the Mishnah], and this is what he said: this [phrase], “her menstrual impurity is communicated to him,” that I stated to you, I did not say other than in regard to the matter that he would be a primary source of ritual impurity like a menstruating woman, that just as she defiles a person and an earthenware vessel, even he defiles a person and an earthenware vessel, but [also] to make a surface designated for lying and sitting [impure], that “and any bedding on which he lies shall become impure,” but that he does not defile a person and vessels like the bedding of a menstruant woman who defiles a person and vessels/utensils, but he has the first degree of defilement that he defiles food and liquids alone.",
                "משכב תחתון כעליון (the lower surface upon which one lies is like the upper one)– that is to say, the lower surface upon which the man who has intercourse with a menstruating woman is like the upper one of a person with gonorrhea, that just as the upper surface of a person with gonorrhea, and that is vessels that are above the person with gonorrhea, such as ten couches one on top of the other and all of them are on top of the person with gonorrhea, whether the person with gonorrhea was in contact with them or not are ritually impure and they defile food and liquids but not humans nor vessels, so also the lower surface of a person who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, that is, the couches that are under him defile food and liquids but not humans and utensils/vessels. Whereas the lower surface below a person with gonorrhea or a woman with a flux or a menstruating woman or a woman after childbirth, even ten couches one on top of the other, and one of these defiled [couches] are above, all of them that are below/the lower surface are impure and defile humans and utensils/vessels.",
                "למעלה מהן זובו של זב כו' – because these that are important and move defile I ay amount through contact and lifting, but a person having sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman does not defile until he raises [her] entirely, because of this it is taught [in the Mishnah], “above them/למעלה מהן,” meaning to say that these are considered are above/more important than someone who has intercourse with a menstruating woman because they defile with any amount, what is not the case with someone who has sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman.",
                "שהם מטמאים במגע ובמשא – that their contact is equivalent to their lifting, that whether through contact or through lifting, they defile humans to defile clothing and vessels other than a person and vessels.",
                "מרכב (riding) – the piece of wood fastened to a saddle, which is grasped on mounting of the saddle is called מרכב/riding – that the saddle itself that a person rides upon is impure because of sitting, and its piece of wood fastened to the saddle, which is grasped on mounting of the saddle is impure because of מרכב/riding.",
                "שהוא מטמא תחת אבן מסמא (that it defiles underneath a stone used for closing a pit – that the corpse was put on a closing – immovable-stone – under which there is a cavity- see Tractate Niddah 69b) – a large and heavy stone, as it is written (Daniel 6:18): “A rock was brought and placed over the mouth of the den; [the king sealed it with his signet and with the signet of the nobles, so that nothing might be altered concerning Daniel].” But if there was a large stone on top of the piece of wood fastened to a saddle, which is grasped on mounting of the riding and a person with gonorrhea grabs hold of it, even though the weight of the person with gonorrhea is not recognized on the riding seat, the piece of wood fastened to the saddle that is under the stone is defiled because of the riding seat.",
                "למעלה מן המרכב משכב – for the stone used for closing a pit that the corpse was put on a closing (immovable) stone defiles lying as it does riding. And more stringent than this is that its coming in contact/touching is equivalent to carrying it to defile a person which defiles his clothing. His coming in contact/touching is explicitly written (Leviticus 15:5): “Anyone who touches his bedding shall wash his clothes, [bathe in water, and remain impure until evening].” And his carrying, that after Scripture mentioned the law of touching by lying and the law of touching by riding it states (Leviticus 15:9-10): “[Any means for riding that one with a discharge has mounted shall be impure; whoever touches anything that was under him shall be impure until evening;] and whoever carries such things shall wash his clothes, [bathe in water, and remain impure until evening],” so we see that regarding lying, whether through contact/touching – whether through carrying, requires the washing of clothing, but concerning riding, Scripture divides between coming in contact with/touching and carrying as it is written (Leviticus 15:9): “Any means for riding that one with a discharge has mounted shall be impure,” whereas that he should wash his clothes, is not written.",
                "ואין משכב עושה משכב – as it is written (Leviticus 15:4): “Any bedding on which the one with a discharge lies shall be impure,” the man with a discharge/gonorrhea makes the bedding [impure] but the bedding does not make the bedding [impure]. Therefore, if the bedding of person with gonorrhea touched/came in contact with vessels/utensils, they are not other than first degree of ritual defilement. It is found that the man with gonorrhea is [on a] higher [level of impurity] than that of bedding."

For regarding a menstruating woman, it is written (Leviticus 15:24): “[And if a man lies with her,] her menstrual impurity is communicated to him and he shall be impure seen days” and it is also written regarding a woman with flux (Leviticus 15:25): “she shall be impure, as though at the time of her menstrual impurity, as long as her discharge lasts,” and we expound upon \"תהיה טמאה היא\"/she shall be impure – to include the man who had sexual intercourse with her. [The word] \"היא\"/she – that she defiles the man who had sexual intercourse with her but the person with gonorrhea does not defile whomever he has had sexual intercourse with for [a period of] seven [days], but only the defilement of contact/touching and carrying.",
                "למעלה מן הזבה מצורע – a leper [defiles] by lying and sitting like a woman with a flux. But more stringent than her, he defiles through entering [a place]. When he comes to the house, everything that is in the house is impure, even though he did not touch it/come in contact with it, as it is written (Leviticus 13:46): “[He shall be impure as long as the disease is upon him. Being impure, he shall dwell apart;] his dwelling shall be outside the camp,” which teaches that is dwelling is impure. From here, they (i.e., the Rabbis) stated that a leper that sits underneath the tree and a pure person passes by, the pure person is defiled. But if a pure person sits underneath the tree and a leper passes by, the pure person is not defiled. And similarly leprous clothing and with a leprous stone. And especially concerning a leper during the days of his receiving final judgment following probationary enclosure, but during the days of his counting, that is, after shaving/cutting off all of his hair and [the offering of] the birds, he does not defile by entering and he does not defile by lying and sitting.",
                "למעלה מן המצורע עצם כשעורה שהוא מטמא טומאת שבעה – as it is written (Numbers 31:24): “On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes and be pure, [and after that you may enter the camp],” all defilements that you become defiled through [contact with] the dead will not be less than seven [days]. But even though that the leper is more stringent than a bone the size of a barley corn, for the leper defiles everything that is in the tent when he comes to the tent, but the bone the size of barley corn does not defile in the tent, nevertheless, on this level, however, the bone the size of a barley corn is more stringent as it defiles an uncleanness of seven[days]. And similarly, all of these are of [increasingly] higher levels that are considered not for every matter it is stated that the second is more stringent than the first, for many of them have a stringency in the first [mentioned] that is not [found] in the second, but for that [higher] level that he counts alone it is stated that the second is more stringent.",
                "חמור מכולם מת – there are those of them [listed] that are more stringent than a corpse, for a man with gonorrhea and a woman with flux makes [defilement] through lying and sitting and defile with the very heavy stone, but a corpse does not [defile] through lying and sitting and doesn’t defile with a very heavy stone. But nevertheless, on this [higher] level, a corpse is more stringent than all of them, as it defiles by overshadowing. For just as a leper causes defilement through entrance, his defilement is not like the defilement of overshadowing, for if he brought his hand into a leprous house, it is pure, and even if he completely entered except for his nose, he is pure, for partial entering is not called entering. And even a partition saves in a house where the leper is, as is taught in the Mishnah of [Tractate] Negaim at the end of the thirteenth chapter [Mishnah 12]: “If he entered the synagogue, they make a partition for him ten handbreadths high [by four cubits wide]. He enters first and leaves last.” And all in a similar manner concerning a corpse that defiles in a tent. Alternatively, there is a division between a sitting leper and a passing leper, as I have explained above, what is not the case regarding a corpse."

And the ten Holy [locations] that are taught in our Mishnah, these are [actually] eleven, the Gaonim that the Land of Israel is not from the number of Holy Places, because in the remainder of the Holy Places, there is within them honor to the place that prevents from them some of the defilements or prevents from some of the people from entering to it. And this holiness is not found merely within the Land of Israel. But the bringing of First Fruits, and the Omer and the two loaves and the shewbread are not like these Holy Things.

And this is where he defiles two degrees, which are first [degree of ritual impurity] and second [degree of ritual impurity] and he invalidates one and it is third [degree level of impurity] and it is invalid for heave offering alone. And the bed girth all the while that it was not removed from the bed is considered like a primary source of ritual impurity, and it defiles two and invalidates one, but after he removes it, it is nothing other than a derivative of the defilement which defiles one and invalidates one, according to the law of a person who touches that which the person with gonorrhea lies upon.",
                "ר' יוסי אומר = Rabbi Yossi according to his reasoning, who stated above (in Tractate Kelim, Chapter 19, Mishnah 3) ten handbreadths and not further. Therefore, that which is within ten [handbreadths] is considered a connection/attachment to lying [by a person with gonorrhea], and it defiles two and invalidates one all the while that he did not remove it. But what is beyond ten [handbreadths] is not considered an attachment to the lying [by a person with gonorrhea], and its law is as it was explained, that it defiles one and invalidates one.",

Such it appears in my eyes an explanation/commentary on this Mishnah. And the reading of my Teachers/Rabbis who have the [textual] reading \"טמא וטהור\" /impure and pure and their explanation, but it was not acceptable to me. And similarly the words of Maimonides who wrote in his commentary to this Mishnah did not enter my eyes are all. And I investigated afterwards in his work (i.e., the Mishneh Torah) in the Laws of Kelim/Vessels, Chapter 21 [Halakha 9] – it appears to me that there he retracted and explained this Mishnah as I explained it here."

But the mat of reeds/poor-man’s mattress which is made for lying, even though it doesn’t have ritual purity in a Mikveh, from what is written (Leviticus 11:32): “any such article that can be put to use shall be dipped in water,” but this is not a utensil/article, nevertheless it is impure through treading as we expand upon from Scripture as it is written (Leviticus 15:4): “Any bedding [on which the one with the discharge lies shall be impure],” [the word] “Any” includes the mat of reeds/poor-man’s mattress , but it ha no ritual purity/cleanliness until it is cut/severed and there remains from it less than six [handbreadths] by six [handbreadths]. But stone vessels and vessels of baked ordure and vessels of earth, are pure from everything. And similarly, everything that comes from the ocean is pure. And wooden vessels that hold the prescribed measurements, that contain forty Se’ah moist which are two Kor in dry, are also pure from everything, because they are not carried full. And similarly, anything which does not have the designation of a vessel, or that is the designation of a vessel but is not from things used by human beings, but are used by those who serve his users, is pure, such as the dresser in which olives are spread and the matting of winepresses and the sheet of frames, that we stated in our Mishnah that they are pure from everything, for they are not considered vessels that are attendant upon humans."
