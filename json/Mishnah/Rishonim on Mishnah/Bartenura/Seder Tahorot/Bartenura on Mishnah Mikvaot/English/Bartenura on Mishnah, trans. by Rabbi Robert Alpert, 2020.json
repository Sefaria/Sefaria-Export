Because a drop that fell from his lips of [waters of] impurity into the place of stagnant waters, but perhaps he drank that which was pure and it became impure, for a person who drinks impure liquids invalidates the heave-offering. And it is one of the eighteen decrees that were decreed “on that day” (i.e., the day that Rabban Gamaliel was removed from the office of head of the Academy/court – see Tractate Berakhot 28a), as it appears in the first chapter of [Tractate] Shabbat [Mishnah 4 – the third of the eighteen decrees as found in the commentary of Rabbi Obadiah of Bartenura]. But even though it does not invalidate the heave-offering unless he drank a quarter-of-a -LOG (i.e., the amount of liquid in one-and-one-half eggs), nevertheless when this impure drop came into his lips, it defiled all the liquid that is in his lips. And that drop does not result in contact between liquids in the place of stagnant waters/puddle, for we are speaking of when it does not have forty Seah as it was taught in the concluding clause [of the Mishnah]. But through physical contact with impurity, the place of stagnant waters/puddle are not defiled until it is [willfully] detached. And this is brought in the Tosefta [Mikvaot, Chapter 1, Halakha 1].",

Therefore, if he did not rinse it, it is pure, and even when he raised the loaf [of bread], the waters in it were not accountable [and not susceptible] to receive impurity from the drop, when the drop was nullified in a pure water.

And similarly, if he drank from several kinds of the seven liquids which are water, wine, olive oil, honey, milk, blood and dew, for these alone are called liquids.
