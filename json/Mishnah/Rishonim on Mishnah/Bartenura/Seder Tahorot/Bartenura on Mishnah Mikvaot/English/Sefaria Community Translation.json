Since a drop fell from the mouth of the impure person into the puddle, and lest the pure person drinks and becomes impure; for he who drinks impure water renders the Terumah invalid. [----]. And even though he doesn't invalidate the Terumah unless he drinks a revi'it, he does in any case become impure once the drop comes to his mouth and renders impure all the water in his mouth with it. And this droplet is not considered Hashokah (osculation) in that there is not forty se'ah, as taught in the end of our Mishna. But through the contact with the impure, the puddle does does not contract impurity until any of its contents are separated from it. And this is as in the Tosefta ",

And if he does not [rinse] then it is pure; insofar as pooled water does not become caused to receive impurity until it has been separated, the halacha is that if he does not rinse then it is pure. And even if he elevates the morsel (of terumah) we do not consider the water than comes along with it to have received impurity from the droplet, because the droplet is nullified by the pure water. But if he does rinse it, we consider and designate the water in his hand as having received impurity from the droplet and the droplet is not nullified by that water rather, on the contrary, [that water] is considered impure and therefore renders the morsel impure"

The reasoning of R' Shimon is [as follows] - I say that the impure droplet of water which fell in from the mouth of the impure person or from the vessel or from the (impure) fluid, (that droplet) will remain on the morsel once all the other water has fallen of of it, and it (the morsel) will be impure. The halacha is not in accordance with R' Shimon."

The water that remains is Pooled Water, and if an impure person drinks from it, or an impure vessel is filled from it, or impure fluid falls in it, the impure droplet is not nullified in it. But throughout the period during which the rain still creeps [down the] mountain, even though the rainfall already ceased, we do not consider it as Pooled Water, and the rain water which afteward creeps down the mountain nullifies the impure droplet, even though the initial water didn't nullify it."
