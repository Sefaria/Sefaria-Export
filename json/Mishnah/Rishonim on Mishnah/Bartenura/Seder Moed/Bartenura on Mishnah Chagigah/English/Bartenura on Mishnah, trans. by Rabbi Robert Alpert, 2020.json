(One could potentially argue that another possibility for a Biblical proof-text could be Exodus 23:17: “Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Sovereign, the LORD, though it lacks the reference to Jerusalem).",

And the person who hears but cannot speak is also exempt as it is written (verse 12): “...[that they may hear] and learn [to revere the LORD your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Teaching].” (NOTE: Rabbinic tradition, as found in the Mishnah of Tractate Terumot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 2, teaches that the deaf-mute individual, of whom the Sages generally spoke in all places, both cannot hear and cannot speak, and the Bartenura commentary on this Mishnah. Also see Chapter 12 of the Mishnah Tractate Yevamot, especially Mishnah four.)",

If he has [with him] many “consumers” (i.e., people who need to eat), and he does not have sufficient with one animal, he brings one animal for the Festival offering from the non-sacred [animals], and the rest comes from the Second Tithe monies, and even though all of comes [for sacrifice] on the First Day of Yom Tov, the “name” of Hagigah/Festival offering is upon them. Nevertheless, the School of Hillel holds that it is permissible to bring the rest from the [Second] Tithe since he has already fulfilled his religious obligation on the First Day from the non-sacred [animals]."
