But if he did not practice [the rituals of] mourning prior to the Festival, but began his mourning during the Festival, the Festivals do not count to the number seven, but count towards the number thirty. And the reason that Shabbat counts to the total of seven days of mourning , because things that are done in private are practiced on it, such as [the prohibition of] sexual relations and removing the mourner’s wrap, for it is prohibited to be with an uncovered heat, and washing in hot water, for the mourner is forbidden [to engage] with them on Shabbat. But on the Festivals, none of the laws of the mourning are practiced/observed on it. Therefore, [the mourning] stops completely. But if mourning did not occur at all prior to the [onset of the] Festival, like the dead was buried during the Festival, it does not count towards the number seven, and one begins to count seven after the Festival."

And the final result of this matter regarding the Halakhic decision is that Atzeret in this time is like the Festivals, and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are like the festivals. He who suffered a loss prior to one of these, even one hour, the decree of [sitting] Shivah is abrogated. And if [the person] died prior to one of these Holy Days, the decree of thirty days is abrogated from him, as we have stated; and the seven days of the Festival count towards the number thirty, which is fourteen days. And Shemini Atzeret/The Eighth Day of Solemn Assembly is a festival unto itself, and is considered as if it is seven days, that makes twenty-one days. We count another nine days until the thirty and that is enough. And the decree of seven as we have stated is that he that was a mourner all seven days is prohibited in washing in hot water, even for part of his body, and in cold [water] all of his body, and he is prohibited from laundering his clothing, and in anointing and in wearing leather [shoes] and in doing work and in greeting others. And he is obligated in wrapping his head in mourning garb , and in turning over his bed, so that all of the beds that are in his house would be turned over on the ground and he should sleep on them, but not upon a bed standing upright. And it is prohibited to cut his nails with a utensil nor the hair of his mustache, even if it prevents him from eating. And it is prohibited to read from the Torah, whether from the Written Torah or from the Oral Torah. And he cannot re-stitch the tear that is upon him. And the decree of thirty is that from the seventh day until the completion of the thirtieth [day], it is prohibited to wear new clothing, or a white ironed garment, and it is prohibited to cut one’s hair, and to enjoy an optional banquet and to go shopping with one’s friends, and to marry another woman, if he has a wife and children, and he cannot sew together the tear that is upon him."

But on all the rest of he relatives, you tear a handbreadth only from the upper part of the garment, and one tears it with a utensil if one desires, and one does not have to separate the border, and he has to bring in his hand under his garment when he is tearing it and he can re-stitch it after seven [days], and sew together the the tear after thirty [days].
