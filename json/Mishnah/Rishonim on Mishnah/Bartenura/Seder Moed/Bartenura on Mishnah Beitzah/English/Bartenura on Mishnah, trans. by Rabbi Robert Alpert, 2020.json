                "ביצה שנולדה ביו\"ט – [on Yom Tov] which is after Shabbat is what we are dealing with. And the reason of the School of Hillel which states “it may not be eaten,” because an egg laid today was fully developed yesterday (Talmud Betzah 2b), and it results that Shabbat would prepare for Yom Tov, and the Torah states (Exodus 16:5): “But on the sixth day, when they apportion [what they have brought in, it shall prove to be double the amount they gather each day],” for a regular Friday is a weekday, on a weekday one prepares for Shabbat, and on a weekday one prepares for a Yom Tov/Festival, for a Festival is also called Shabbat, one does not prepare on a Yom Tov for Shabbat nor does one prepare on Shabbat for a Yom Tov. And preparation like this of the egg, even though it is in the hands of heaven, it is called preparation. However, Shabbat and Yom Tov are important, as they require that their meals have preparation/designation on a weekday, and on one of them, one can prepare for its fellow, even with preparation at the hands of heaven, but the meal of a weekday is not considered important nor does it require preparation. Therefore, on a mere Sunday which is not a Holy Day, we don’t forbid an egg that was laid on that day because it was completed on Shabbat, but the meal of a weekday, the all-Merciful does not require preparation while it is still daylight. But they (i.e., the Rabbis) an egg that was laid on any Holy Day/Yom Tov, and even though it is not after the Shabbat, as a decree because of a Holy Day that comes after the Sabbath. And similarly, they forbade an egg that was laid on every Sabbath to quaff/swallow a living animal, as a decree because of a Shabbat that comes after a Yom Tov. For a Sabbath and a Holy Day that are juxtaposed one to the other, an egg that is laid on this one is forbidden [to be eaten] on that one. And similarly, the two days Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah, but the second Holy Days of the Diaspora that whatever be your opinion one of them is a weekday, and an egg that is laid on this one is permitted on that one.",
                "שאור בכזית – as regarding eating, everyone does not dispute that both this (leaven) and that (leavened bread) are [forbidden] with an olive’s bulk, for since the Biblical verse begins with שאור/leaven and concludes with חמץ/leavened bread. “No leaven shall be found in your houses [for seven days]. For whoever eats what is leavened, [that person shall be cut off from the community of Israel],” to tell you that this is “leaven” and that is which is leavened, as is the case with the one is also the case with the other. But they (i.e., the Schools of Hillel and Shammai) argue regarding removal, as the School of Shammai holds that since the All-Merciful has written for both leaven and that which is leavened, and to write [the word] Hametz/leavened product, for its that which is a strong leavening agent (see Talmud Betzah 7b), and despite this, one is obligated to remove it, and it is an a fortiori for leaven which is a strong leavening agent, but we learn from this that the measurement for the one is not like the measurement of the other, and we don’t derive removal [of Hametz] from eating. But the School of Hillel holds that both (i.e. שאור וחמץ) [are forbidden] by an olive’s bulk, as we derive removal from eating. But because that these three things are of the liberal opinions of the School of Shammai and the of the stringencies of the School of Hillel regarding the Yom Tov, they are taught together.",

Bet Shammai responded to them that this is not the case, for if you said concerning the Hallah and priestly gifts that they are deserving of separating their priestly gifts, the Sages gave the strength and the permission for their being set apart for a sacred purpose, for since their obligation comes on the Festival day, since we knead and slaughter on the Festival day, and since they were permitted on the Festival day, we permit to bring them up even those that were made from the eve of the Festival day, shall we say that the Priest’s due which is not worthy in being brought up that it is impossible that the obligation for Terumah should come to the pile on the Festival Day, since there is no obligation for Terumah other than from the time of smoothing out the pile and we don’t smooth out the pile on the Festive Day, therefore, we don’t bring up the Terumah on the Festival Day."
