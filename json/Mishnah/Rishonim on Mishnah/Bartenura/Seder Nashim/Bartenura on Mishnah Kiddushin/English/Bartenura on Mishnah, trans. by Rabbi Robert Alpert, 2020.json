And [through] money, which is via others, is different, for the acceptance by the master causes him to be liberated on his own, and these others cannot act on behalf of a person to the latter’s disadvantage, other than through the acceptance of the master, for the master is not made into his agent, but rather, for the needs of himself, and who transfers [possession] on his own.",

And the Halakha is according to the Sages. But the Canaanite slave acquires his [freedom] if his master blinded his eye or caused him to lose a tooth or mutilated from him one of twenty-four heads of limbs, which are [the tops] of the fingers of the hand, and digits of the feet, and the tops of the ears, the head of the nose, and head of the male genitals, and the tops of a woman’s breasts, and that which is not considered in our Mishnah to be included in those things that the slave acquires himself, because one who goes free through the tops of his limbs requires a document of manumission from his master, that is, that he acquires himself through a document.",

And the Halakhic decision is that whether [we are speaking of] a small animal or a large animal, it is acquired by “pulling” and all the more so by lifting up, for “pulling” acquires in a market-stand/alley adjoining an open place to which merchants retire to transact business, which is the corner of the public domain, or in the courtyard of both of them (i.e., the seller and the purchaser). But “pulling” purchases in the public domain or in a courtyard that does not [belong] to them both. And “lifting” acquires in any place.

And we learned the oath of implication from the woman suspected of having committed adultery, as it is written (Numbers 5:22): “And the woman shall say, ‘Amen, Amen,’” “Amen” from this man, “Amen” from another man,” “Amen” that she did not act foolishly while she was betrothed; “Amen” that she did not act foolishly while married, a widow waiting for the יבם/the dead husband’s brother to marry or reject her and the case of a woman conduced to one’s house to consummate the marriage."

And we do not say that when he received it, it took effect, for since it is taught that “it was theirs and it was Seventh-year produce,” that because it was of the Seventh year and the produce was ownerless, because of that, the women are betrothed, but sisters cannot be betrothed [to one man], but if it (i.e., the produce) was not of the Seventh-year, for it was [in reality] theirs (i.e., belonging to the sisters), betrothal does not take effect with any one of them. But especially when one betroths with stolen [produce] prior to despair [of the original owner of getting it back], we say that it is not a betrothal, but when one betroths with stolen [produce] after [the original owner] despairs [of getting it back], his betrothal is a betrothal. And we understand also that one who betroths with Seventh-year produce is betrothed. And we don’t say that they are not his monies to take possession of them, but rather, since he took possession of them, it is his money for all matters. And we also understand that a woman can become an agent for her fellow [female], and even in a case where she becomes her rival. And even though that in all testimony where a woman is fit to, the rival is not fit for it. But her agency, however, since it was done, it was done. For here in these betrothals, they are made rivals one to the other when she accepts it, for it is taught that sisters cannot become betrothed [to the same man], but women who are strangers (i.e., not related) may be betrothed [together]. And our Mishnah is reconciled in the Gemara (Kiddushin 52a) according to this Halakha, that a person who betroths a woman and her daughter or [betroths] a woman and her sister, both (i.e., woman and daughter AND woman and her sister) are viewed as one, and they are not betrothed. For one was [regarding] a woman and her daughter and one was [regarding] a woman and her sister, such as the case where he said to both of them: “One of you is betrothed to me,” but he did not explicate to which of them he is betrothing, and one of them accepted the betrothal/Kiddushin on behalf of her [female] partner (i.e., either her sister or her daughter), or both of them accepted the Kiddushin/betrothal as one, betrothed, but both of them require a Jewish bill of divorce. And if he said: “[to the one] who is appropriate for me for engage in sexual relations is betrothed to me,” they are not betrothed, for each one of them (i.e., these pairs of women – woman and sister; woman and daughter) there is [the question] of doubting her [on account of] the sister and of his wife, and none of them are appropriate for sexual relations. And there is also the story (spelled out in our Mishnah) and among them, two are sisters and one [man] collected a basked containing chosen fruits and said to the one appropriate for sexual relations, “become betrothed to me.” But the Sages said, that sisters may not become betrothed [to one man], but strangers who were worthy for sexual relationships can be betrothed. But if one [man] said: “All of you are betrothed to me,” not a single one of them are betrothed to him, for just as sisters cannot become betrothed [together to the same man], so all the others cannot betrothed to him, since he said, “all of you.”"
