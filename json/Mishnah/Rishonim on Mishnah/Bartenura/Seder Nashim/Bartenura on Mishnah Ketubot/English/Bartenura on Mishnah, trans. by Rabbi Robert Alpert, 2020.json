And they responded that the Sages were considerate towards the daughters of Israel (in ordaining weddings to be held on the fourth day of the week) that he should be engaged in preparations for the [wedding] meal for three days, Sunday Monday and Tuesday and on Wednesday, he would consummate the marriage. And at a time when the Jewish courts would not be in session on Mondays and Thursdays, a woman may be married on any day, but that he should be engaged in the preparations for the [wedding] meal for three days. And because of the ordinance for the poor, we have the practice in some places to marry on Fridays. And the reason that a widow [would marry] on Thursdays, is because the Sages were considerate towards the daughters of Israel that he should be happy with her for three days: Thurday, Friday and Shabbat. And a person who marries a widow it is prohibited to engage in work for three days, but one who marries a virgin [is prohibited to engage in work] all seven days. And regarding the wedding blessings [in the Birkat HaMazon/the blessing following the meal], it makes no difference whether a young man married a widow or whether a widower married a virgin, we recite the wedding blessings all seven days.
