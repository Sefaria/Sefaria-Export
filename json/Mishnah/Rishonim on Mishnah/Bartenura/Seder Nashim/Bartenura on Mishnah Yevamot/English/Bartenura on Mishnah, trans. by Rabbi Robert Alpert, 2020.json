But I don’t have anything but her, her rival-wife, from where do we learn this in the Torah? The inference teaches us לצור צרתה (I Samuel 1:6) – “her rival”; from where do we learn in the Torah צרתה? The inference teaches us (Leviticus 18:18): לצרור – “as a rival,” which implies “do not marry,” neither he nor her rival wife, nor the rival of her rival wife.",

It is possible that his mother married his brother from his father, and when he dies without children, it is found that his mother falls before her son for levirate marriage, and there are found sixteen women who exempt their rival/co-wives, and is mother is one of them, and this is the Halakha."
