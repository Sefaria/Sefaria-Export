But the shaving for a leper does not count for him, neither for the shaving of a pure Nazirite, nor for the shaving of an impure Nazirite, and he still needs two shavings: one for the impure Nazirite and one for the pure Nazirite. And if he was a declared leper, all what he counted for the days of his Naziriteship do not count for him. For the days of his declared [leprosy] and the days of his counting do not count for him.

But he is still prohibited to drink wine or to defile himself through contact with the dead. For perhaps he was a declared leper and therefore, the first two shavings did not count for him for the sake of his Naziriteship, not for defilement nor for purity, for perhaps he was an impure Nazirite. And the third shaving is the shaving of defilement. Therefore, he is required to count another thirty days of pure Naziriteship, and he brings the sacrifice of a pure Nazirite and makes the condition, and afterwards is permitted to drink wine and to become defiled through contact with the dead. And similarly, if he took a vow of Naziriteship for a year, and something happened to him at the beginning of his year of uncertain defilement through contact with the dead, and uncertain leprosy, he counts a full year and shaves the shaving of uncertain defilement and uncertain purity and uncertain leprosy, ad counts a second year and shaves and brings his atonement and eats Holy Things [if he is a Kohen] and counts another two years prior to his drinking wine and defiling himself through contact with the dead."

And that which it (i.e., the Mishnah) took [linguistically] that he went down to immerse, it is something remarkable that is being taught to us, for even though that a person who immerses from his defilement to ritual purity is warned from all things that defile, even so, he is defiled.",
