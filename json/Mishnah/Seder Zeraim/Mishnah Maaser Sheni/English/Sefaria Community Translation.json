Rabbi Yehoshua said: The tenth that I will measure in the future is given to Elazar ben Azaria and its location is rented to him. And they each received payment from the other.",
            "By the afternoon of the last festival day, they would make the declaration. How was the declaration made? \"I have removed the <i>Kodesh</i> [consecrated material] from the house\" (Deuteronomy 26:13)--this is <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> and <i>Neta Revai</i>. \"Have given them unto the Levite\"--this is <i>Ma'aser Levi</i> [The first tithe of produce, which must be given to the Levi]. \"And also I have given it\"--this is <i>Terumah</i> and <i>Terumat Ma'aser</i>. \"And also to the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow\"--this is the poor man's tithe, <i>Leket</i> [fallen gleanings given to the poor], <i>Shikhecha</i> [forgotten gleanings given to the poor], and <i>Pe'ah</i> [corner of a field given to the poor], even though these do not invalidate the confession [if they have not been given]. \"From the house\"--this is <i>Challah</i> [dough that must be set aside for the priest].",
            "\"Like all of Your commandments that you commanded me\" (Deuteronomy 26:13). Thus if one preceded <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> to <i>Ma'aser Rishon</i>, he is not able to recite the confession. \"I did not violate Your commandments\"--I did not separate [tithes] from one species on behalf of a different species, nor from uprooted produce on behalf of rooted produce, nor from rooted produce on behalf of uprooted produce, nor the <i>Chadash</i> [grain from the current year] on behalf of the <i>Yashan</i>, nor the <i>Yashan</i> on behalf of the <i>Chadash</i>. \"I did not forget\"--I did not forget to bless You and mention your name for it. ",
            "\"I have not eaten from it in my mourning\" (Deut. 26:14). Thus if he did eat from it in mourning, he cannot confess. \"And I have not consumed any of it when unclean.\" Thus if he separated it while impure, he cannot confess. \"And I did not give from it to the dead\"--I did not buy with it a coffin or shrouds for the dead, nor did I give it to other mourners. \"I listened to the voice of Hashem my G-d\"-- I brought it to the Chosen Temple. \"I have done everything that you have commanded me\"-- I was joyous, and I caused joy with it. ",
            "\"Gaze from Your holy abode, from the heavens\" (Deut. 26:15). We have done what You decreed upon us, so too You do what You promised us, [to] \"gaze from Your holy abode, from the heavens, and bless Your nation, Israel\" with sons and daughters. \"And the land that You have given us\" [bless] with dew and rain and the offspring of cattle. \"Just as You have sworn to our forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey\" so that You will give taste to the fruit.",
            "From this they said, Israelites and bastards confess, but not converts and not freed slaves, for they do not have a portion in the land. Rabbi Meir says, even priests and Levites do not, for they did not take a portion in the land. Rabbi Yosi says, they have cities [with surrounding] open land.",
            "Yochanan the High Priest dismissed the confessions of the tithe. He also eliminated those who recited the \"Wake up\" verse and the knockers [of sacrificial calves]. Until his day, the hammer would be striking in Jerusalem. In his day, no one had to ask about <i>Demai</i> [produce from which it is uncertain if tithes were already taken]."
