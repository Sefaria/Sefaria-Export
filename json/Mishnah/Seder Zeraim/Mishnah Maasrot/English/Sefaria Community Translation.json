            "They stated a rule with regard to tithes: Anything which is food, and is guarded, and grows from the earth, requires tithes. And they stated another rule: Anything that is in its beginning is food, and in its end is food, even if one guards it [and does not pick it when it is small] in order to add food, requires tithes whether it is small or large. And anything that is not in its beginning food, but is in its end is food, does not require tithes until it becomes food.",
            "From when are fruits required to be tithed? Figs from when they begin to ripen. Grapes and raisins, from when the seed can be seen through the skin. Sumac and strawberries, from when they redden. And all the red [fruit], from when they redden. And pomegranates, from when [their seeds] can be crushed. Dates, from when they begin to swell like leaven. Peaches, from when they develop [the appearance of] veins. Nuts, from when they become like a storehouse [for the separated nutmeat within]. Rabbi Yehudah says, nuts and almonds, from when they develop an [inner] husk.",
            "Carobs, from when they form [dark] spots. All dark fruits, from when they form [dark] spots. And pears and Crustumenian pears and quinces and crab-apples, from when they lose their fuzz. All white fruits, from when they lose their fuzz. Fenugreek, from when [its seeds] will grow [if planted]. Grain and olives, from when they have produced one-third [of what they can produce].",
            "And regarding vegetables: Cucumbers, gourds, melons, cucumber-melons, apples, and citrons require tithes whether large or small. Rabbi Shimon exempts the citron when small. That which requires [tithes] for bitter almonds [which require tithes only when young], is exempt [from tithes] for sweet [almonds, which require tithes only when fully grown]. That which requires for sweet, is exempt for bitter. ",
            "What is the [stage at which different items require tithes, just as wheat does when it reaches the] granary [stage and] requires tithes? Cucumbers and pumpkins, from when their blossoms are removed. If he doesn't remove their blossoms, from when he stacks a pile. Melons, from when they are trimmed. If they are not trimmed, from when they are stored away. Vegetables that are bundled, from when he bundles them. If he does not bundle them, from when he fills the vessel. If he does not fill the vessel, from when he has collected as much as one needs. [If collecting into] a basket, once he covers it. If he does not cover it, once he fills up the vessel. If he does not fill the vessel, once he has collected as much as he needs. In what situation does this apply? When bringing to the market. But when bringing to his house, he may eat casually from them until he reaches his house.",
            "Dried pomegranate, raisins, and carobs, [require tithes] from when he stacks a pile. Onions, from when he peels [them]. If he does not peel, from when he stacks a pile. Grain, from when he smoothes [it] even. If he does not smooth even, from when he stacks a pile. Beans, from when he sifts [it]. If he does not sift, from when he smoothes even. Even though he has sifted, he may take from the broken and from the sides and from what is in the midst of the grain and eat [it].",
            "Wine, from when he skims [the scum from its surface]. Even though he has skimmed, he may collect from the upper winepress and from the pipe and drink. Oil, from when it falls into the trough. Even though it has fallen, he may take from the olive pulp bale and from between the olive press-stone and from between the board and put it on the batter-cake or on the plate, but he may not put it in the pot or in the stew-pot when they are boiling. Rabbi Yehudah says, he may put it in anything, except for something that has in it vinegar and brine. ",
            "A round fig cake, [requires tithes] from when we smooth it out. It may be smoothed out by [the juices of] non-tithed figs or grapes. Rabbi Yehudah forbids [this]. One who smoothes out by [the juice of] grapes, does not make it susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Yehudah says that it is made susceptible to impurity. Dried figs, [require tithes] from when they are pressed. Storehouse [dried figs], from when they are rounded [into cakes]. If one was pressing [figs] with a barrel or rounding storehouse [figs], and the barrel broke or the storehouse [figs] became defective, he may not eat casually from them. Rabbi Yose permits."

            "If one was passing through the market and said, “Take for yourselves [from my] figs,” they may eat and be exempt [from tithes]. Therefore if they brought them into their houses, they must separate tithes as [one does for] certainly non-tithed [produce]. [If he said], “Take and bring it into your houses,” they may not eat casually from them. Therefore if they brought them into their houses, they do not need to separate tithes except as [one does for] <i>Demai</i> [produce from which it is uncertain if tithes were already taken].",
            "If they were sitting at the gate or in a store and someone said, \"Take for yourselves [from my] figs,\" they may eat and be exempt. But the owner of the gate or the owner of the store would be required. Rabbi Yehudah exempts him, unless he hides his face, or unless he changes the place where he is sitting.",
            "If one brings produce from the Galilee to Judah or makes a pilgrimage [and brings produce] to Jerusalem, he may eat [of the produce] until he arrives at the place where he was going, and so too in returning. Rabbi Meir says, until he arrives at the place of stopping. And the merchants who peddle in the cities may eat until they arrive at the place of sleep. Rabbi Yehudah says, the first house [in the city where he will sleep should be considered as if] it is his house.",
            "Produce from which he separated <i>Terumah</i> before their work was finished: Rabbi Eliezer forbids eating casually from them, but the Sages permit except when it is a basket of figs. A basket of figs from which he separated <i>Terumah</i>: Rabbi Shimon permits, but the Sages forbid.",
            "One who says to his friend: “Here is this <i>Issar</i> [specific unit of money], and give me five figs for it”, he may not eat [of them] until he has tithed [them], the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says: if he ate them one by one, he is exempt. If he combined them, he is required [to tithe.] Rabbi Yehudah said: it happened in a rose-garden that was in Jerusalem, and there were figs being sold three or four for an <i>Issar</i>, and neither <i>Terumah</i> nor tithes were ever set aside from it.",
            "One who says to his friend: “Here is this <i>Issar</i> for ten figs that I will choose for myself,” he may choose and eat [the figs one at a time without tithing. If he said,] “For a cluster of grapes that I will choose for myself,” he may pick [grapes from the cluster] and eat [one at a time]. [If he said,] “For a pomegranate that I will choose for myself,” he may take apart [the pomegranate] and eat [it one piece at a time]. [If he said] “For a melon that I will choose for myself,” he may slice and eat [it one piece at a time]. But if he said “For these twenty figs,” or “For these two clusters,” or “For these two melons,” he may eat them in his usual way and be exempt [from tithes], because he bought them while they were still attached to the ground.",
            "One who has hired a worker to dry figs with him, and [the worker] said to him, “On the condition that I may eat of the figs,” he may eat them and is exempt [from tithing]. [If he said,] “On the condition that my son and I may eat,” or “that my son may eat in lieu of my receiving a wage,” he eats and is exempt [from tithing what he eats], but his son eats and is required [to tithe]. [If he said,] “On the condition that I may eat of them during the harvest time and after the harvest time,” during the harvest time he eats and is exempt [from tithing], but after the harvest time he eats and is required [to tithe], since he does not eat of them in a manner mandated by the Torah.  This is the general rule: one who eats in a manner mandated by the Torah is exempt [from tithing], and one who does not eat in the manner mandated by the Torah is required [to tithe].",
            "If [a hired worker is] working among bad figs, he may not eat of white figs. If among white figs, he may not eat of bad figs, but must restrain himself until he reaches the place of the better figs, and [there] he may eat. If a man exchanges with his friend, either [figs] to be eaten for [figs] to be eaten, or [figs] to be dried for [figs] to be dried, or [figs] to be eaten for [figs] to be dried, then he is required [to give tithes]. Rabbi Yehudah says: one who exchanges for [figs] to be eaten is required, but [for figs] to be dried is exempt."

If he combined them, he is required [to tithe]. [If he had been hired] to weed onions, and he said to him, “On the condition that I may eat of the vegetables,” he may pluck leaf by leaf and eat [without tithing]. If he combined them, he is required [to tithe].",

But in [a case of] olives and carobs, they require [tithes]. If one found dried [untrodden] figs, then if the majority of people had already trodden [their figs], he is required [to tithe them], but if not, he is exempt. If one found slices of [trodden] fig-cake, he is required [to tithe] since it is obvious that they come from a finished item. With carobs, if one has not yet brought them to the top of the roof, if he takes some of them down for his animals he is exempt [from tithing] since he puts back the leftovers.",

Rabbi Akiva says: any courtyard that one person may open and another may lock is exempt. Rabbi Nechemiah says: any courtyard in which a man is not ashamed to eat makes [produce] require [tithing]. Rabbi Yossi says: any courtyard into which a person may enter into and no one says to him, “What do you seek?” makes exempt. Rabbi Yehudah says: if there are two courtyards, one within the other, the inner makes [produce] require [tithing] and the outer makes exempt.",

The potters' sukkah , the inner makes [produce] require [tithing] and the outer makes exempt. Rabbi Yossi says: anything that is not both a sunny season dwelling and a rainy season dwelling makes exempt. A sukkah of the festival used on the festival [of Sukkot]: Rabbi Yehudah makes [produce brought into this sukkah ] require [tithing], but the Sages exempt.",

Coriander that was sown in a courtyard: one may pluck leaf by leaf and eat [without tithing], but if he combines them, he is required [to tithe]. <i>Satureia Thymbra</i>, hyssop, and thyme that are in the courtyard, if they are protected, they require [tithes].",

If it stands in a garden and hangs over into a courtyard, one may eat [the figs] one at a time and be exempt, but if he combines [them], he is required [to tithe]. If it stands in the Land [of Israel] and hangs over into <i>Chutz La'Aretz</i> [outside of the Land of Israel, or if it stands] in <i>Chutz La'Aretz</i> and hangs over into the Land [of Israel], in all [cases the law] is decided according to the [position of the] root. And as regards houses in walled cities, in all [cases the law] is decided according to the [position of the] root. But as regards an <i>Ir Miklat</i> [city of refuge for accidental murderers], in all [cases the law] is decided according to the [position of the] branches.
