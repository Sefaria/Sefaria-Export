Concerning charity collectors, the school of Shammai say that one gives tithed produce to those who do not tithe and untithed produce to those who do tithe: this way, everybody eats fixed [tithed] produce. The sages say, one simply takes and simply distributes, and he who wants to fix will fix.",

If one buys vegetables from the market and then decides to return them, he should not return them until he has tithed them, since they [the bundles] lack nothing but counting. However, if he is standing and selecting [the vegetables] and then sees another bundle that is of better quality he may return them [without tithing] because he has not yet grasped them [in a manner of acquisition].",

If from the start he took them [the produce] so that they should not spoil, they are exempt.  Anything which a person is not permitted to sell when it is <i>Demai</i> should also not be sent to a friend when it is <i>Demai</i>. Rabbi Yossi allows this [in a case of] certainly [untithed produce], as long as he informs him.",

One who leaves his [tithed] produce in the keeping of a Cuthite or an <i>Am HaAretz</i>, it [the produce] retains its presumptive status for tithes and for the Sabbatical year; in the keeping of a non-Jew, it is like his [the non-Jew's] produce.
