            "One who gathers sheaves into hat-shaped piles or cap-shaped piles or circular piles, these are not [subject to] Shikhechah; if they are taken from there to the threshing floor, they are [subject to] Shikhechah. One who gathers sheaves to a stack, they are [subject to] Shikhechah; if they are taken to the threshing floor, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah. This is the general rule: When the sheaves are gathered to a place where their work is completed, they are [subject to] Shikhechah; from there to the threshing floor, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah. [When the sheaves are gathered] to a place where their work is not completed, they are not [subject to] Shikhechah, from there to the threshing floor, they are [subject to] Shikhechah.\n"
