These are things the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the principal remains for him in the World to Come: Honoring one's father and mother, acts of kindness, and bringing peace between a man and his fellow. But the study of Torah is equal to them all.",
            "One should not make the <i>Peah</i> less than one-sixtieth [of the entire crop]. And although they [the Sages] say that there is no definite amount given for <i>Peah</i>, it is all based upon the size of the field and upon the number of poor [who will be collecting it] and upon the abundance of the crop.",
            "One may give <i>Peah</i> from the beginning of the field or from its middle. Rabbi Shimon says: only if one gives the full measure at the end. Rabbi Yehudah says: if one has left even one stalk [at the end], he adjoins to it [what he has left to the beginning or middle, and it becomes <i>Peah</i>], if not, he has merely made it ownerless.",
            "They made a rule about <i>Peah</i>: all which is food and which is guarded and grows from the ground and collected in one crop and stored for preservation is obligated in <i>Peah</i>. Grain and legumes are [included] in this rule.",

If a priest or a Levite bought a granary the tithes are theirs, until he smoothes out [the pile]. One who dedicates [produce for Temple use] and redeems [the dedicated produce] is obligated in tithes, until the treasurer smoothes out [the pile]."

One who harvests for the purpose of animal food creates a division - [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir; the Sages say: He does not create a division unless he plowed.",

Rabban Gamliel said: It was customary in my father’s house to give one  <i>Peah</i> for the olive trees on each side, and for the carob trees [to give once for] all that are in sight of one another.

Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteirah says: [The size that would be needed] in order to harvest and repeat, and the law is according to his words. Rabbi Akiva says: Any size of land is obligated in <i>Peah</i>, and in <i>Bikurim</i> [First-fruits that must be brought to the Temple and given to the priest], and a <i>Pruzbul</i> [legal arrangement which avoids the mandatory Sabbatical year cancellation of personal debts by deeding them to the court, and being subsequently appointed their agent for collection] may be written against it, and movable property are acquired along with it by means of money, contract, or <i>chazakah</i> [action taken upon a property to formalize its legal acquisition].",

If an ear of grain that is <i>Leket</i> is intermixed in a stack, one ear must be tithed and given to him [the poor man].

Rabbi Yosi says: They give the value of the [added] growth [after dedication] to the Temple treasury. What is considered <i>Shikcha</i> on a trellis? Anything that he [i.e. the harvester] is unable to take by stretching back his arm. And on runners? When he moves on from it."

            "From when is everyone permitted in [taking] <i>Leket</i> [individual stalks that fall during harvest, which must be left for the poor to glean]? When the weakest of the poor have [come and] gone. And when for <i>Peret</i> [fallen grapes given to the poor] and <i>Olelot</i> [individual grapes which fall during the grape-harvest which must be left for the poor to collect]? From when the poor have [come and] gone and come [again]. And when for olive trees? When the second rain has come; Rabbi Yehudah said: Are there not those who do not harvest their olive trees until after the second rain? Rather, when the poor go out [to glean amongst the olives], and do not bring back [an amount of olives worth] four <i>Issarot</i> [specific unit of money].",
            "[Poor] people [selling produce] are trusted regarding <i>Leket</i>,<i>Shikcha</i>, and <i>Peah</i> [corner of the field which, while harvesting, must be left for the poor] in their time [i.e., during the harvest], and regarding <i>Ma'aser Ani</i> [a second tithe given to the poor in the third and sixth years of the Sabbatical cycle] all year long. A Levite is trusted at all times. And we do not trust them [i.e., the poor] except regarding things that people are accustomed to [give them].",
            "[Poor] people are trusted concerning wheat, but they are not trusted regarding flour and not regarding bread. [Poor] people are trusted regarding rice on the stalk, but are not trusted regarding it [the rice itself], whether raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning beans, but not trusted concerning grits, whether raw or cooked. [Poor] people are trusted concerning oil, to say that it is <i>Ma'aser Ani</i>, but are not trusted to say that it is <i>Nikuf</i> [the last olives shaken down by the poor].",
            "[Poor] people are trusted regarding raw vegetables but not trusted regarding cooked vegetables, unless he had a small amount, because it is common that the property owner takes it out from his stew pot.",
            "One must not give less [<i>Ma'aser Ani</i>] to the poor from the threshing floor [than the following measures]: half a <i>Kav</i> [specific unit of volume] of wheat and a <i>Kav</i> of barley - Rabbi Meir says: half a <i>Kav</i>; a <i>Kav</i> and a half of kasha; a <i>Kav</i> of dried figs or a <i>Maneh</i> [specific unit of volume] of figs - Rabbi Akiva says: a <i>Pras</i> [half a <i>Maneh</i>]; half a <i>Log</i> [one fourth of a <i>Kav</i>] of wine - Rabbi Akiva says: a quarter; a quarter of a <i>Log</i> of oil - Rabbi Akiva says: An eighth [of that]. As for the rest of the produce, Abba Shmuel said: Enough that he can sell it and buy food for two meals.",
            "This measure applies to priests and Levites and Israelites. If one wants to save some [e.g., for poor relatives], he may retain half and give half. If he has a small amount [less per poor person present than the amounts indicated], he places it before them, and they divide it between themselves.",
            "One must not give [<i>Tzedakah</i>] to the  poor who wander from place to place less than a loaf that is the price of a  <i>Pundion</i>, when  four <i>Seah</i> [of grain] cost a <i>Sela</i>. If he spends the night, one gives [bedding] supplies for the night. If he stays for Shabbat, one gives him food for three meals. One who has [enough] food for two meals must not take from the soup kitchen. [If he has enough] food for fourteen meals, he must not take from the charity box. And the charity box [funds] are collected by two people and distributed by three people.",
            "One who has two hundred <i>Zuz</i> may not take <i>Leket</i>, <i>Shikhechah</i>, <i>Peah</i> or <i>Ma'aser Ani</i>. If he has one <i>Dinar</i> less than two hundred, even one thousand [people] simultaneously give him [a <i>Dinar</i>, he may take [them all]. If [his assets] are mortgaged to his creditor or his wife’s marriage contract, he may take. He is not obligated to sell his house or his [fine] clothes [in order to take agricultural gifts].",
            "Someone who has fifty <i>Zuz</i>, and he uses them for business, he may not take. And anyone who does not need to take, but takes anyway, will not depart from the world until he will become dependent on others. And all who need to take, yet do not take, will not die from old age until he will [be enabled to] provide for others from his portion. Regarding this, scripture states, “Blessed is the man that relies on G-d, and G-d will be his security” (Jeremiah 17:7). [The same is true] for a judge who judges in absolute truth. And he who is neither lame, nor blind, nor crippled, yet he pretends to be one of these, he will not die of old age until he becomes like one of these, as it says, “Justice, justice shall you pursue.” (Deuteronomy 16:20) And every judge who takes a bribe and subverts the law, he will not die of old age until his eyes have dimmed, as it says, “And you shall not take a bribe, because a bribe blinds those who can see and understand, etc.” (Exodus 23:8)"
