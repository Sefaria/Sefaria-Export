If one sows wheat and barley  [together] at once, that is considered <i>kilayim</i>; Rabbi Yehudah says: it is not <i>kilayim</i>, unless there are two [grains] of wheat and one [grain] of barley or one [grain of] wheat and two [grains of] barley or one grain [each] of wheat, barley and spelt."

[With respect to]  grain with [a different species of] grain, legumes with [a different species of] legumes, grain with legumes, and legumes with grain.

Rabbi Shimon says, just as they said [their ruling to result] in stringency, so too they said [their ruling to result] in leniency. Flax with grain combine to make up one twenty-fourth of that which falls [is sown] into a <i>beit se'ah</i>.",

If it [the wheat] has has already sprouted, he is not to say, \"I will [first] sow [the barley], and then I will turn it over,\" but he must turn it over, and afterwards sow. How much must he plow?

[A field of] grain that an aftergrowth of <i>istis</i> sprouted, similarly, if on the threshing floor different species sprouted [which are harmful to threshing], or if among fenugreek different species have sprouted [which are harmful to the fenugreek] we do not require him to weed them out.

If his [field is sown] with wheat and his neighbor's [is sown] with a different species, it is permitted to sow close [to the neighbor's field] the same species [as the neighbor's field]. If his [field is sown] with wheat, and his neighbor's is [also sown] with wheat, he is permitted to sow close [to the neighbor's field] a furrow of flax [since flax is not ususally sown with wheat], but not a different species. Rabbi Shimon says, it is the same whether it is flax or any other species [they are all prohibited]. Rabbi Yose says, even in the middle of the [wheat], one may experiment with a furrow of flax [it is not considered <i>kilayim</i>].",

If [in a grain field] there are one or two patches [each less than a <i>beit rova</i>], he may sow them with mustard ; [if there were] three, he may not sow them with mustard for it will look like a mustard field, these are the words Rabbi Meir.  The Sages say, Nine patches [for each <i>beit se'ah</i>] are permitted [to be sown with whatever you desire], ten are prohibited . Rabbi Eleazar ben Yaakov says, Even if his entire field is a <i> beit kor</i> [specific unit of volume], he may not make [sow] in it more that one patch.",

Grains [planted next to] other grains [require a separating distance of] a <i>beit rova</i>. Herbs [planted next to] other herbs [require a separating distance of] six handbreadths. Grains [planted next to] herbs, or herbs  [planted next to] grains, [require a separating distance of] a <i>beit rova</i>.

If it [the bed] has a border [on all four sides] one handbreadth high [and one handbreadth wide, thus the bed measures 8 x 8]  thirteen different species may be sown in it; three on each border and one in the middle. One may not plant turnip heads in the border as they will fill it up [and it appears all intermingle]. Rabbi Yehudah says, six different species [may be sown] in the middle [for a total eighteen species].",
            "It is forbidden to sow [different] species [of seeds that are normally grown in large fields] in one bed, but [diffrent] species  of herbs may be sown in one bed. Mustard and small peas are [considered] seeds, [while] large peas are [considered] herbs. [If] a border [around a bed] that had been one handbreadth high was lowered, it remains valid, because it was originally valid. A furrow or a [dried up] water channel that are one handbreadth deep, one may sow three [different] species of seeds, one [species] on one side, and one [species] on the other side and one in the middle.",
            "If a triangular corner point of herbs enters into a field of a different herb it is permitted [it is not considered <i>kilayim</i>], because it is obvious that it is the end of the field. If the field was sown with [one species of] herbs and he wishes to plant in it one row of different herbs, Rabbi Yishmael says, [he may do so] providing that the furrow is open [runs through] from one end of the field to the other. Rabbi Akivah says, the length [of the furrow] must be six handbreadths and the width must be its fullsize [six handbreadths]. Rabbi Yehudah says, [the furrow must be] the width of a full footstep [one handbreadth].",
            "If one plants two rows of cucumbers, two rows of gourds and two rows of Egyptian beans [with furrows separating between them], it is permitted [because they are discernable]. [However, if he planted] one row of cucumbers, one row of gourds and one row of Egyptian beans, they are prohibited [they appear to have been planted together]. [If he planted] one row of cucumbers, one row of gourds and one of Egyptian beans, and [then ] a row of cucumbers, Rabbi Eliezer permits, and the Sages prohibit.",

            "If his field was sown with onions and he wishes to plant in it rows of gourds, Rabbi Yishmael says, he must uproot two rows [of onions; a row is four cubits, so a total of eight cubits is made empty] and plant one row [four cubits of gourds in the middle;  so two cubits on each side remain empty], he [then] leaves the standing crop of onions over a space of two rows [eight cubits wide] and uproots two rows [of onions] and plants one row [of gourds].  Rabbi Akivah says, he must uproot two rows [of onions] and plant two rows [of gourds], he [then] leaves the standing crop of onions over a space of two rows and uproots two rows [of onions] and plant two rows [of gourds]. The Sages say, If there is not between one row [of gourds] and the next twelve cubits, he may not maintain the seeds [of onions] between them.",

If his field was sown with grain, and he wishes to plant in it one row of gourds, we give it for its work space [for tillage] a space of six handbreadths. If it grew [spread into the six handbtbreadth area] he must uproot in front of it. Rabbi Yose says, we give it for its work space [for tillage] four cubits. The [Sages] said to him, Why do you apply more stringent rules to this  [gourds] than to a vine? Rabbi Yose said to them [the Sages], We indeed find that this is treated more stringently than a vine, [since] for a single vine we allow six handbreaths for its work space [for tillage] , and for a single gourd we give it a <i>beit rova</i> [for its tillage]. Rabbi Meir in the name of Rabbi Yishmael said, If there are three gourds in an area of a <i>beit se'ah</i> he may not bring [sow] any other [species of] seed  into the <i>beit se'ah</i>.

A vineyard that has been planted in an irregular fashion [not in sraight rows], if there are among them [five vines] two opposite three [two facing each other and one projecting like a tail], it is considered a vineyard, but if not, it is not considered a vineyard.

A winepress in a vineyard, ten [handbreadths] deep and four  [handbreadths] wide, Rabbi Eliezer says, one may sow in it, and the Sages say forbid it. A watch-mound [where the watchman stands]  in a vineyard ten [handbreadths] high and four  [handbreadths] wide, one may sow in it, but if the ends of the vine-branches became entwined [over the mound] it is forbidden.",

The <i> eirus</i> [plant with broad leaves, used for seasoning food], ivy like, the <i>shoshanat hamelekh</i> [king's lily] are not <i>kilayim</i> in a vineyard.

Biet Shammai say, [the four cubits are measured] from the body [trunk] of the vine to the field. Beit Hillel say, from the fence to the field.

Rather if there are [in the <i>aris</i>] four cubits from the body to the fence, [then] we give it  [six handbreadths] as work space [for tillage] and he may sow in the rest [up to the fence].

But if not [he cannot pick them from the field] it only prohibits [sowing] that which is directly beneath it.

There was an incident that Rabbi Yehoshua went to Rabbi Yishmael to Kefar Aziz, and he [Rabbi Yishmael] showed him a vine that was suspended over part of a fig-tree. He said to him [he asked Rabbi Yehoshua], \"May I bring seed under the rest?\" He [Rabbi Yehoshua] said to him, \"It is permitted,\" and he took him up to Beit Hamaganya, and he showed him a vine suspended over part of a branch [beam] of a sycamore tree, which had many branches. He [Rabbi Yehoshua] said, \"Under this [the branch over part of which the vine had been suspended] it is prohibited, and [under] the rest is permitted.",
