            "\tFrom which time may the Shema be recited in the evenings? From the time that the Cohanim have gone in to eat their terumah [Cohanim who became unclean and who immersed may not eat terumah until \"their sun has set\"; that is, until the stars have appeared. The reason \"From the time the stars have appeared\" is not stated is that we might thereby be apprised of an incidental learning, viz., if the Cohanim become defiled with the type of uncleanliness where their cleansing entails an offering (such as zav or metzora), the want of this expiatory offering does not prevent them from eating terumah, it being written (Leviticus 22:7): \"And when the sun has set vetaher ('and the day has ended'), he may eat of the holy things\" — the setting of the sun is a prerequisite for his eating terumah, but his expiatory offering is not], until the end of the first watch. [the first third of the night, the night being divided into three watches. From that point on, it is not considered the time of the recital of the Shema of reclining, and it does not satisfy (Deuteronomy 6:7): \"…when you lie down.\" And before the stars come out, too, it is daytime, and not the time of lying down. And those who are beforehand and recite the evening Shema while it is still day, rely in this on R. Yehudah, who says (26a) that the Minchah prayer may be recited until midway through the afternoon, an hour and a quarter before the night. And it is ruled that one may follow R. Yehudah in this regard — that immediately upon the expiration of the time for the Minchah prayer, the time for the recital of the evening Shema begins.] These are the words of R. Eliezer. And the sages say: Until midnight. R. Gamliel says: Until the appearance of the morning star. [For the entire night is considered the time of lying down. And the halachah is in accordance with R. Gamliel, the sages, too, agreeing with him, having said \"Until midnight\" only to keep one far from transgression. However, ab initio, when the time of the recital of Shema of the Mishnah arrives —- that is, when the stars appear — one is forbidden to repast, and, it goes without saying, to sleep, until he recites the Shema and prays.] It once happened that his sons came late from a feast [The sons of R. Gamliel heard that the sages had said: \"Until midnight,\" and this is what they said to him: Do the sages differ from you, saying: \"Until midnight,\" specifically, and not afterwards? (and \"one against many, the halachah is according to the many\"), or do the sages hold with you, but say \"until midnight\" to keep one far from transgression? And he answered: The sages hold with me, and say: \"Until midnight\" to keep one far from transgression; and you are obliged to recite it.], and they said to him: We did not yet recite the Shema. He told them: If the morning star has not yet appeared, it is incumbent upon you to recite it. And not this alone [(This is still R. Gamliel speaking to his sons)] did they say, but wherever the sages say \"until midnight,\" the mitzvah obtains until the appearance of the morning star. The mitzvah of burning the fats [of the offerings] and the pieces [of the daily afternoon burnt-offering — It is a mitzvah to offer up the pieces the entire night, viz. (Leviticus 6:2): \"It is the burnt-offering upon its firewood on the altar all the night until the morning.\"] obtains until the appearance of the morning star. And the mitzvah of eating all of those offerings which must be eaten in one day [such as a thank-offering, a sin-offering, a guilt-offering, and the like, which are eaten a day and a night — the time for eating them is until the appearance of the morning star; and it is that which brings them to the status of nothar (left beyond the designated time and requiring to be burned)], (\"the mitzvah, etc.\") obtains until the appearance of the morning star. If so, why did the sages say: \"Until midnight\"? [in respect to the recital of the Shema and the eating of offerings. But they did not say \"until midnight\" at all in respect to the burning of the fats and the pieces, having mentioned this here only to apprise us that the mitzvah of all things designated for the night obtains the entire night.] To keep one far from transgression. [that he not come to eat them after the appearance of the morning star and incur kareth (\"cutting-off\"); and, similarly, with the recital of the Shema, that he not say \"I still have time\" and miss the designated time].",
            "\tFrom which time may the Shema be recited in the morning? When it is possible to distinguish between the tcheleth (blue) and the white. [between the strands of tcheleth and the strands of white in the tzitzith. That is, after the shearing of the wool, which is dyed tcheleth, there are places where the dye does not take well and which remain white.] R. Eliezer says: Between tcheleth and leek-green. [The color of tcheleth is close to the green of leeks.] And the time of its recital is until sunrise. R. Yehoshua says: Until the third hour [of the day. Until the end of the third hour, which is one-quarter of the day when the days and the nights are equal. And the time of the recital of the Shema is always until one-quarter of the day, whether the days are long or short. Similarly, in (Chapter 4, Mishnah 1): \"The time of the morning prayer is until the fourth hour of the day,\" the meaning is until one-third of the day, \"the fourth hour\" being mentioned because one-third of the day is four hours long when the days and nights are equal. Whenever the Mishnah mentions \"thus and thus hours of the day,\" it is to be understood along these lines. I understand this to be Rambam's interpretation and I accept it. The rationale for R. Yehoshua's \"Until the third hour of the day\" is that usually the sons of kings do not rise from their beds until the end of the third hour; and the intent of the Torah in \"and when you rise\" is until the time when all men have risen from their beds. And the halachah is in accordance with R. Yehoshua. However, ab initio, one should attempt to synchronize the recital of Shema with sunrise, as the vatikim (\"the early saints\") did.], it being the custom of the sons of kings to rise at the third hour. One who recites it after this time does not forfeit anything thereby [that is, he does not forfeit the blessing before and after; but even though he goes beyond its time, he recites it along with the blessing before and after], as one who reads in the Torah. [Even though he did not recite the Shema in its designated time, he receives reward as one who reads in the Torah.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: In the evening all men recline [on their sides, it being written: \"when you lie down\" — in the manner of lying down] and in the morning they stand, [it being written: \"and when you arise\" — in the manner of rising], as it is written (Deuteronomy 6:7): \"and when you lie down and when you arise.\" And Beth Hillel say: Each man recites it in his own way, [either standing, sitting, reclining, or walking] it being written (Ibid.): \"and in your walking on the way.\" If so, why is it written \"when you lie down and when you arise\"? The time when men lie down, and the time when men arise. R. Tarfon said: \"Once, while on the road, I reclined to recite it in accordance with Beth Shammai, and I came close to being set upon by robbers\" — whereupon they said to him: \"You would have deserved to be killed [(and if you had died, your blood would have been upon your own head)] for having transgressed the words of Beth Hillel.\"",
            "\tIn the morning he recites two benedictions before it (the Shema) [\"yotzer or\" and \"ahavah\"], and one after it [\"emeth veyatziv\"]; and in the evening he recites two benedictions before it [\"ma'ariv aravim\" and ahavath olam\"] and two after it [\"emeth ve'emunah\" and \"hashkiveinu\"], one long and the other short. [This refers to the two benedictions before it. \"Yotzer or\" is long, opening with \"Baruch\" and closing with \"Baruch,\" as does \"ma'ariv aravim.\" \"Ahavah\" is short, closing with \"Baruch,\" but not opening with \"Baruch.\"] Where the sages prescribe the lengthening of a benediction, it is not permitted to shorten it. Where they prescribe shortening, it is not permitted to lengthen. Where they prescribe closing [with \"Baruch\"], it is not permitted not to close. Where they prescribe not closing [as in the blessings over fruits and over mitzvoth], it is not permitted to close.",
            "\tThe exodus from Egypt is mentioned at night. [The section of tzitzith is recited in the evening Shema even though the night is not a time for tzitzith, it being written (Numbers 15:39): \"And you shall see it\" — to exclude a night garment; it is recited at night because of the exodus of Egypt which it includes.] R. Elazar b. Azaryah said: \"I am as one who is seventy years old [i.e., I looked old. He was not really old, but his hair turned white on the day he was appointed Nassi, so that he appear old, and qualified for the Nassiate. And on that day, Ben Zoma expounded this verse.] velo zachithi [I did not prevail over the sages. A similar instance (Niddah 38b): \"In this, zichnahu R. Elazar over the rabbis\" — that is, he prevailed over them] that the exodus from Egypt be recited at night, until Ben Zoma expounded it (Deuteronomy 16:3): \"…so that you remember the day that you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life\": \"the days of your life\" — the days; \"all the days of your life\" — the nights. And the sages say: \"the days of your life\" — this world; \"all the days of your life\" — to include the days of the Messiah."

            "\tIf one were reading [the section of the Shema] in the Torah and the time for the recital [of the Shema] arrived — if he concentrated, [According to the view that mitzvoth require intent, \"If he concentrated\" is understood as: if he were intent upon fulfilling his obligation; and according to the view that mitzvoth do not require intent it is understood as: if he concentrated upon reciting it with the correct vocalization (as opposed to reciting it for proof-reading purposes, where he does not read the words as they are vocalized, but as they are written in order to discriminate between defective and plene forms, in which instance he does not fulfill his obligation). And we rule that mitzvoth require intent.], he has fulfilled his obligation, and if not, he has not fulfilled his obligation. Between sections [\"Between sections\" is explained later in our Mishnah.] he extends greeting out of honor [He extends greeting to one whose honor warrants it, such as his father, or his teacher, or one superior to him in wisdom], and he returns greeting. [It goes without saying that he returns greeting to them if they greet him first.] And in the middle [of a section], he extends greeting out of fear [i.e., where he is afraid that the other might otherwise kill him. And it goes without saying that he returns greeting to him. But he may not do so out of honor], and he returns greeting. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Yehudah says: In the middle [of a section] he extends greeting out of fear, and returns greeting out of honor [i.e., in deference to one it is incumbent upon him to honor]. Between sections he returns greeting to all men [who greet him. And the halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah. And wherever it is forbidden to interrupt the recital, it is forbidden to speak in the holy tongue as in any other language.]",
            "\tThe following constitutes \"between sections\": between the first blessing and the second, between the second and Shema, between Shema and vehaya im shamoa, between vehaya im shamoa and vayomer, between vayomer and emeth veyatziv. R. Yehudah says: It is forbidden to interrupt between vayomer and emeth veyatziv. [For it is written (Jeremiah 10:10): \"And the L-rd G-d is emeth.\" Therefore, it is forbidden to interrupt between ani hashem elokeichem and emeth. And this is the halachah.] R. Yehoshua b. Karcha said: Why was Shema placed before vehaya im shamoa? So that one first take upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven, and thereafter the yoke of mitzvoth. Why was vehaya im shamoa placed before vayomer? For vehaya im shamoa obtains both by day and by night [it being written therein (Deuteronomy 11:19): \"And you shall teach them to your sons\"; and the mitzvah of Torah study obtains both by day and by night.], whereas vayomer obtains only by day. [For it contains the section of the mitzvah of tzitzith, which does not obtain at night, it being written (Numbers 15:39): \"And you shall see it.\"]",
            "\tOne who recites the Shema without causing himself to hear it fulfills the obligation. R. Yossi says: He does not fulfill the obligation. [For it is written (Deuteronomy 6:4): \"Hear\" — Let your ear hear what your mouth utters. And the first tanna holds: \"Hear\" — in any language that you are accustomed to hear. And the halachah is according to the first tanna.] If he recited it without being precise with its letters [to enunciate them clearly, in an instance of two words where the second word begins with the same letter with which the first letter ends, as in \"al levavcha,\" \"esev besadecha,\" \"va'avadetem meherah.\" If he does not leave space between them to separate them, it sounds as if he is pronouncing two letters as one.] — R. Yossi says: He has fulfilled his obligation. [And the halachah is according to R. Yossi. However, ab initio, he must enunciate the letters. Likewise, he must take care not to rest the mobile sheva and not to move the quiescent, and not to weaken (by pronouncing without a dagesh) a strong form and not to strengthen a weak one. And he must accentuate the zayin of \"tizkeru,\" so that it does not sound like \"tiskeru,\" that is, \"so that you amass reward.\" For it is not fitting to serve the Master for the sake of reward.] R. Yehudah says: He has not fulfilled his obligation. If one recites it in inverted order [If he recites the third verse before the second, the second before the first, and the like], he has not fulfilled his obligation [it being written (Deuteronomy 6:6): \"and these words shall be\" — they shall remain in their original form, i.e., as they are ordered in the Torah. However, if he advances the section, reciting vayomer before vehaya im shamoa, and vehaya im shamoa before Shema, it would seem that this is not considered \"inverted,\" and he fulfills his obligation; for they are not thus arranged, one after the other, in the Torah.] If he recited it and erred, he returns to the point of the error. [If he erred between one section and another, not knowing with which section he left off and to the beginning of which section he should return, he returns to the first verse, vehaya im shamoa. (Rambam says: Veahavta eth Hashem.) And if he stopped in the middle of a section, knowing which section, but not knowing where in that section he left off, he returns to the beginning of that section. If he recited \"uchethavtam,\" but did not know whether it were that of Shema or that of vehaya im shamoa, he returns to the \"uchethavtam\" of Shema. And if he were in doubt after he began leman yirbu, he does not return, for he can rely on \"the habit of his tongue.\"]",

Though they are apprehensive of falling and cannot concentrate, the sages did not require them to descend; for only the first verse of the Shema requires concentration], something they are not permitted to do for tefillah (Shemoneh Esreh) [for prayer is the imploration of mercy, and it requires concentration, so that they must descend to pray.]",
            "\tA bridegroom is exempt from the recital of the Shema the first night, until motzai Shabbath if he had not performed the act. [A bridegroom who married a virgin is exempt from the recital of the Shema the first night, being preoccupied lest he not find her to be a virgin. And I have heard that (his preoccupation is) the fear that he might become kruth shafchah (mutilated) through intercourse, this being \"preoccupation of a mitzvah.\" And Scripture states (Deuteronomy 6:7): \"and in your walking upon the way\" — It is in your (mundane) \"walking\" that you are obliged to recite it, but not in that entailed by a mitzvah. \"if he had not performed the act\": if he had not had intercourse until motzai Shabbath, his \"preoccupation\" lasting four nights [from the customary day (Wednesday) of the wedding for a virgin]. After that time, he is \"familiar\" with her and no longer preoccupied, so that even if he had not yet performed the act, he must recite the Shema.] It happened that R. Gamliel recited the Shema on his wedding night, at which his disciples said to him: \"Did our master not teach us that a bridegroom is exempt from the Shema?\" He answered: \"I will not heed you to divest myself of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven for even a short while!\"",

He would suffer if he did not bathe, and only bathing for pleasure is forbidden a mourner.]",

Gamliel said: \"Not all who wish to take the Name may do so.\" [If he is not recognized as a sage and a porush (saintly) in other matters, this is nothing but pride, pluming oneself on exemplary powers of concentration. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel. We find some of our rabbis saying that today all men should recite the Shema on their wedding night. For since in these generations we do not recite it with much concentration on all the other days, if a bridegroom did not recite the Shema on his wedding night, he would seem even more haughty, giving the impression that he concentrated at all other times except this, being preoccupied with the mitzvah.]"

And the mitzvah of tefillin is a time-oriented positive commandment, for it does not obtain at night and on the Sabbath; but we would think that since it is likened to mezuzah, it is binding upon women. We must, therefore, be apprised otherwise. \"Minors\": A father is not obligated to train in the recital of the Shema even a minor who had arrived at the age of training; for the son is not always to be found with his father at the time of recital. And a father was not obligated to train a minor in the mitzvah of tefillin, for he cannot be expected to guard himself against expelling air while wearing them.] And tefillah, mezuzah, and the recital of grace are binding upon them. [For tefillah is the imploration of mercy, and a rabbinical ordinance; and it was instituted for women, too, and for the training of minors. \"Mezuzah\": We might think, since mezuzah is likened to Torah study, that just as women are exempt from Torah study, it being written (Deuteronomy 11:9): \"And you shall teach them to your sons\" — and not to your daughters, they should, likewise, be exempt from mezuzah, even though it is not a time-oriented positive commandment; we are, therefore, apprised otherwise. \"The recital of grace\": It is open to question whether the recital of grace is Scripturally binding upon women, it being written (Deuteronomy 8:10): \"And you shall eat, and you shall be sated, and you shall bless\" — so that it is a non time-oriented positive commandment — or whether it is not Scripturally binding upon women, it being written (Ibid.): \"for the good land which He has given you\"; and the land was not given to females.

One-fiftieth of that is subject to the Cohein's terumah gedolah; and so long as the terumah gedolah has not been separated, even though the terumah of ma'aser has been separated, no zimun is made over it.

Therefore, he may not place the towel on the table, lest the water in the towel become tame via the table and, in turn, impart tumah to the food. If he places it on the pillow, however, the only cause for concern is that tumah might be imparted to his hands — Better that his hands become tame (there being no Scriptural basis for such tumah, the Torah not requiring washing of hands for non-consecrated food) than that food become tame, there being Scriptural basis for this, first-order tumah imparting second-order tumah to non-consecrated food.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: the house is swept [The place where they ate is swept of crumbs], and then the hands are washed [for grace. For sometimes the waiter is an am ha'aretz and leaves over olive-size food particles; and if you say that the hands are washed first, food will be spoiled. For the waters of this latter washing will drip upon them and \"sully\" them.] And Beth Hillel say: The hands are washed and then the house is swept. [Beth Hillel hold that it is forbidden to employ a waiter who is an am ha'aretz; and a waiter who is a talmid chacham (a Torah scholar) will not leave over olive-size food particles, but will remove them. And if the water drips upon particles less than the size of an olive, there is no cause for concern. For such particles may be voided to being with. The halachah in this instance is in accordance with Beth Shammai, it being permitted to employ a waiter who is an am ha'aretz.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: [If one were eating on Sabbath afternoon and it got dark, and he had not yet finished his meal and he had enough wine for only one cup] (the order for blessing is:) candle, grace, spices, and havdalah. Beth Hillel say: candle, spices, grace and havdalah. [All agree that havdalah is last, the departure of the (Sabbath) day being delayed, so that it not appear burdensome to him. They differ only in respect to candle and spices, Beth Shammai saying: candle, grace, and then spices; and Beth Hillel saying that candle and spices go together, for blessings that we can make, which do not give the impression of burdensomeness, such as candle and spices, we recite before grace. Beth Shammai say: \"Who created the light of the fire.\" [\"who created,\" in the past; and not \"who creates,\" which implies the future. \"the light of the fire,\" and not \"the lights of the fire,\" there being only one light in the candle.] And Beth Hillel say: \"Who creates\" [the past, too, being implied] \"the lights of the fire\" [many shades being found in the flame: red, white, and greenish.]",
            "\tOne does not make the blessing over the candle or the spices of idolators [Not over the candle, because it did not \"rest,\" the idolator having worked by its light; and it is forbidden to make a blessing over a candle that did not rest, a transgression having been committed by it. And not over the spices of idolators. The reference is to spices used in a festive gathering of idolators. And this is the intent of the latter part of the Mishnah: \"And not over the candle and not over the spices before idolatry,\" i.e., Why does one not make a blessing over the spices of idolators? For it may be assumed that a festive gathering of idolators is for idolatrous proposes and it is forbidden to make a blessing on spices used for idolatry.] and not over the candle and the spices used for the dead, [the candle (for the dead) being used for honorific purposes, and the spices being used to dispel odor.] And not over the candle and not over the spices before idolatry. One does not bless over the candle until he benefits by it [by its light. Not that he benefit by it, per se, but that he be close enough to benefit by it if he wishes to.]",
            "\tIf one ate and forgot to say grace, Beth Shammai say: He returns to his place and blesses; and Beth Hillel say: Until the food in his stomach is absorbed. [So long as he is not hungry because of that repast, it is a sign that the food has not yet been absorbed. And it is only in an instance of one's having forgotten, that Beth Hillel says he does not return; but, where his omission is deliberate, all agree that he returns to his place and says grace.]",
            "\tIf wine were brought to them after the meal, and only that cup were there, Beth Shammai say: He blesses on the wine and then he says grace [for grace does not require a cup]; and Beth Hillel say: He says grace and then blesses on the wine, [Beth Hillel holding that grace requires a cup.] One answers \"Amen\" after a Jew who has made a blessing [even if he did not hear the \"Name,\" but only the end of the blessing; for it may be assumed that the blessing was \"for Heaven\"]; but one does not answer \"Amen\" after a Cuthite who has made a blessing unless he has heard the entire blessing [lest he made the blessing to Mount Gerizim.]"

(Jeremiah 10:13): \"To the sound of His pouring hoards of water in the heavens\"], and over winds [which blow tempestuously and which occur only occasionally], he says: \"Blessed is He whose power and might fill the world.\" [And if he wishes he says: \"Blessed is He who makes the creation,\" all of these being acts of creation, viz. (Psalms 135:7): \"He made lightnings for the rain.\" But over mountains and hills, etc., he says \"Who makes the creation,\" specifically; for he cannot say: \"Whose power and might fill the world,\" these not being seen in all the world, but each in its own place.] Over mountains, hills, seas, rivers, and deserts, he says: \"Blessed is He who makes the creation.\" R. Yehudah says: If he sees the great ocean [Oceanus, which surrounds the world], he says: \"Blessed is He who made the great ocean\" [it being accorded a blessing in itself because of its vastness and significance.] This is so when he sees it upon occasion [after thirty days]. Over rains and good reports, he says: \"Baruch hatov vehametiv\" (\"Blessed is He who is good and does good\") [This is so when he has land in common with another, the implication being: \"who is good (to him) and does good (to others)\"; but if he has no land at all, he says: \"We thank You, O L-rd our G-d, for every drop that You brought down for us, etc.\" And if he has land by himself, he blesses: \"shehecheyanu.\"], and over bad tidings he says: \"Baruch dayan ha'emeth\" (\"Blessed is the true Judge\").",

Though the soil is saturated and the field made more fertile for the years to come, now, however, it is evil, and he blesses \"dayan ha'emeth\"], and over a good in which an evil inheres [as when one finds a lost object. Even though it is evil for him, for if the king hears of it, he will be beaten and tortured and the object taken from him, now, however, it is good, and he blesses \"hatov vehametiv\"]. Crying out over what is past constitutes a vain prayer. [If one prays for what has already taken place, this is a vain prayer, for \"what has been has been\"], as in one's praying: \"May it be Your will that my wife bear a son,\" when she is already pregnant; or, as in one's returning from a journey and hearing wailing within the city, praying: \"May it be Your will that it not be coming from my house.\"",

When he is about to leave, he says: \"…that You lead me from this town in peace.\" Once he has left, he says: \"I give You thanks for having led me from this town in peace.\"] And he gives thanks for the past and cries out for the future.

[When he blesses \"dayan ha'emeth\" for the ill, he must do so with joy and with goodness of heart, just as he does when he blesses \"hatov vehametiv' for the good], viz. (Deuteronomy 6:5: \"And you shall love the L-rd your G-d with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your might.\" \"with all your heart\" — with both of your inclinations, the good and the evil.\" \"and with all your soul\" — even if he takes your soul. \"and with all your might\" — with all your wealth.

[All of the gates were aligned with one another: the eastern gate, the gate of the ezrath nashim, the gate of ezrath Yisrael, the entrance of the Ullam, the sanctuary, and the holy of holies — in the days of the first Temple.] One may not enter the Temple Mount with his staff, his shoe, his punda [a hollow belt where money is kept. Another interpretation: a garment worn on one's flesh to absorb sweat so that it not soil his other garments. It is demeaning for one to go out in that garment alone.], and with the dust on his feet. And he should not make it kapandaria [to go in by that entrance and to come out by the opposite one, thereby shortening the distance. \"kapandaria\" - \"ademakifna dari, a'ol beha,\" i.e., \"Instead of circuiting rows of houses, I shall (shorten my walk and) enter here.\"] And spitting [is forbidden in the Temple Mount] a fortioti [from shoes, viz.: If the wearing of shoes, which is not a demeaning act, is forbidden there, how much more so, spitting, which is a demeaning act!] All (prayer leaders) in the Temple would close blessings with \"from the world\" [The prayer leader says at the end of every blessing: \"Blessed is the L-rd the G-d of Israel from the world until the world, the Bestower of knowledge\"; and so with all. And the answerers say: \"Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingdom forevermore.\" For \"Amen\" is not answered after every blessing in the Temple, it being written (Nechemiah 9:5): \"Arise and bless the L-rd your G-d from the world until the world,\" and, afterwards (Ibid.): \"And they shall bless the name of Your glory.\" That is, they answer: \"Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingdom forevermore.\" And we are apprised here that in the first Temple they said only: \"Blessed is the G-d of Israel from the world,\" and not more. They did not say: \"until the world.\"] When the heretics, [who do not believe in the resurrection] distorted this, [saying: There is no world but this one], they [Ezra and his beth-din] instituted that they say: \"from the world until the world\" [i.e., there are two worlds, this world and the world to come.] And they instituted that one greet his fellow in the name [of the L-rd, this not being regarded as denigrating the honor of the L-rd for the honor of men, \"taking\" the name of the L-rd for their sake]. For it is written (Ruth 2:4): \"And, behold, Boaz came, of Bethlehem, and he said to the harvesters: 'The L-rd be with you,' and they said to him: 'The L-rd bless you,'\" and (Judges 6:12): \"And he (the angel) said to him (Gideon): 'The L-rd be with you, O man of valor!'\" and (Proverbs 23:22): \"Do not scorn ki zakna imecha,\" and (Psalms 119:126): \"It is time to act for the L-rd; they have voided your Torah,\" which R. Nathan expounded: \"They have voided your Torah at a time of acting for the L-rd.\" [If it be contended that Boaz used this blessing of his own volition and that this cannot be taken as a precedent, this is negated by the angel saying to Gideon: \"The L-rd be with you, O man of valor.\" And if it be contended that the angel is not saying this by way of greeting, but apprising him by the L-rd's embassy, that the Shechinah is with him, so that it, too, cannot serve as a precedent — this is countered by: \"Do not scorn ki zakna imecha,\" viz.: Do not scorn Boaz, saying that he acted of his own volition; but learn miziknei umathecha (\"the elders of your people\"). He has authority to reply upon, viz.: \"It is time to act for the L-rd; they have voided your Torah,\" which R. Nathan interpreted, etc., i.e.: Sometimes words of Torah are voided in order to act for the L-rd. — as in the instance of one greeting his fellow (in the name of the L-rd). This, indeed, is the will of the L-rd, viz. (Psalms 34:15): \"Seek peace and pursue it.\" It is permitted to \"void\" Torah and to do something which seems forbidden.]"
