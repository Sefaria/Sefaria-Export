            "Until when is plowing done in a field with trees in the pre-Sabbatical year? According to Beit Shammai, as long as the plowing contributes to the growth of the fruit. According to Beit Hillel, until Shavuot [festival at the end of the wheat harvest]. These two measures are almost identical.",
            "What is considered an orchard? Any [field which has at least] three trees per <i>Beit Se'ah</i> [area of land large enough to be planted with a <i>Se'ah</i> of grain]. If they are able to produce a block of pressed figs of sixty Italian <i>Maneh</i> [specific unit of weight], one can plow the whole <i>Beit Se'ah</i> on their account. Less than this, one can only plow for them an area [that would be needed to be] filled by the gatherer with his basket at his side.",

If they are able to produce a block of pressed figs of sixty Italian <i>Maneh</i>, one can plow the whole <i>Beit Se'ah</i> due to their presence. Less than this, one can only plow [what the trees] need.",
            "If one [tree] makes a block of pressed figs and two do not, or two make and one does not, one cannot plow for them except for their needs, as long as there are between three and nine [trees]. If there are at least ten, from ten and up, [regardless of] whether they produce or do not produce,  the entire <i>Beit Se'ah</i> can be plowed because of their presence. As it says (Exodus 34:21), \"From the plowing and the reaping you shall rest\"; [this verse] is not needed to discuss the plowing and reaping of the Sabbatical year, rather the plowing of the pre-Sabbatical year that enters the Sabbatical year, and the reaping of the post-Sabbatical year that leaves the Sabbatical year. Rabbi Yishmael says, [this verse is needed to say that] just as [the prohibition extends only to] optional plowing, so too to optional reaping, excluding reaping the <i>Omer</i> [barley offering].",
            "If three trees belong to three different people, they combine and the whole <i>Beit Se'ah</i> can be plowed for them. And how much [distance] needs to be between them? Rabban Gamliel says, [enough distance] that a [pair of] oxen can pass [between them] with a plow.",
            "Where ten saplings are scattered in a <i>Beit Se'ah</i>, one may plow the whole <i>Beit Se'ah</i> on their account up until <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> [New Year's festival]. If they are arranged into a row or surrounded by a border, then one may only plow on their account what is necessary for them.",

            "For how long are they called saplings?  Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says, until they become unconsecrated.  Rabbi Yehoshua says, [until they are] seven years old.  Rabbi Akiva says, a sapling is like its name. A tree that was cut down and has put out branches -- [if it was cut] lower than a handbreadth is like a sapling, and higher than a handbreadth is like a tree, [these are the] words of Rabbi Shimon."

Rabbi Shimon said: You have entitled each person to make his own ruling! Rather, in a vegetable field until Passover, and in an orchard until Shavuot.",
            "One may fertilize and aerate cucumbers and gourds up until Rosh Hashanah. And [one may do] similarly in an irrigated field. One may remove wounds [from trees], remove withered leaves, apply nutrient powder, and fumigate plants until Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Shimon says that one may additionally remove certain leaves from grape clusters during the seventh year.",
            "One may clear stones until Rosh Hashanah. One can prune, thin, and remove decay [from trees] until Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Yehoshua says, just as the thinning and cutting of the fifth [going into the sixth], so too the sixth [going into the seventh]. Rabbi Shimon says, as long as I am permitted to cultivate the tree, I am permitted to deal with its decay.",
            "One may apply a foul-smelling dressing to the saplings, and wrap them, and trim them, and make housing for them, and water them until Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok said, one may even water the crown and branches during the Sabbatical year, but not the roots.",
            "Unripe figs may be oiled and pierced until Rosh Hashanah.  The unripe fruit of the pre-Sabbatical year once the Sabbatical year has begun, or of the Sabbatical year once the post-Sabbatical year has begun, may not be oiled and may not be pierced. Rabbi Yehudah says, Where it is customary to oil, they may not oil, because it is work; but where it is not customary to oil, they may oil. Rabbi Shimon permits [working] trees [after the Sabbatical year, though they still bear fruit], because because one is permitted [then] to work the tree [itself].",
            "One may not plant, bend [a plant so that it takes root], or graft [by attaching two plants] on the eve of the Sabbatical year, less than thirty days before Rosh Hashanah. And if he did plant, bend [a plant so that it takes root], or graft [by attaching two plants], he must uproot. Rabbi Yehudah says, Any grafting which hasn't taken hold within three days will not take hold thereafter. Rabbi Yossi and Rabbi Shimon say, within two weeks.",

            "Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says, Egyptian beans which were originally planted for seed are treated similarly. Rabbi Simon says, thick beans are similar to them. Rabbi Elazar says, thick beans when they developed pods before Rosh Hashanah.",
            "If one witheld water from seedless onions and Egyptian beans for thirty days prior to Rosh Hashanah, they are tithed according to the preceding year, and are permitted in the Sabbatical year. If not, they are forbidden in the Sabbatical year, and are tithed according to the following year. [The same is true for seedless onions and Egyptian beans planted] in a non-irrigated field, if one withheld [from those plantings] water for two watering cycles, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: [This is only true for] three [cycles].",
            "Gourds grown for seed, if they hardened before Rosh Hashanah and became unsuitable for human consumption, they are permitted to be kept during the Sabbatical year. If not, they are forbidden to be kept during the Sabbatical year. Their sproutings are forbidden in the Sabbatical year. One may water the soil of a vegetable field according to Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov forbids it. One may flood rice during the Sabbatical year. Rabbi Shimon says, however one may not trim."

Three dung-heaps to every <i>Beit Se'ah</i> [an area of 50 x 50 cubits] [consisting of a minimum of] ten baskets of a <i>Letekh</i> [specific unit of volume] each. One may add to the [number of] baskets, but not to the [number of] heaps. Rabbi Shimon says, even to the [number of] heaps.",

The sages forbid [more] unless he has lowered [the surface] three [handbreadths] or raised [the surface] up three [handbreadths]. A person may heap up his manure into one great heap. Rabbi Me'ir forbids, unless he has deepened three [handbreadths] or raised up three [handbreadths]. If he has a small amount, he may continue adding to it. Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah forbids, unless he has deepened three [handbreadths] or raised up three [handbreadths] or places it on rock.",

[He may later] uproot three sides, and leave the middle [fence, and then re-fence on the other side of that remaining fence]. So it turns out, he has penned in cattle in [an area of] four <i>Beit Se'in</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says, [an area of] eight <i>Beit Se'in</i>. If his entire field is four <i>Beit Se'in</i>, he should leave aside a portion of it, on account of <i>mar'it ha'ayin</i> [an action or situation which might be misinterpreted by the casual viewer, who might think it involves a transgression where there is none, or come to permit forbidden actions based on what he has seen]. [When the penned-in area is full,] he may remove [the manure] from the enclosure and put it in his field in the manner of those who deposit manure.",

Less than this, and he should chisel and raze until it is less than one handbreadth from the ground. When is the aforementioned true? When dealing with one's own [field]. However, within that of one's neighbor, what one wants one may take. When is the aforementioned true? When one didn't start [removing the stones] prior to the seventh year. But if one started prior to the Sabbatical year, what one wants one may take [even on one's own field into the Sabbatical year].",
            "Stones which were disturbed by the plow, or were covered and are now exposed - if there are [at least] two of them that are two-person loads - these may be removed. One who is removing stones from his field may remove the upper ones, but must leave those lying on the ground. Similarly, regarding piles of pebbles or of stones, one may remove the upper ones, but must leave those lying on the ground. If, however, the ground beneath them is rock or stubble, these [lowest] ones may be removed.",

However, one may build during the Sabbatical year once the rains have ceased, as this is [merely] improving [the land] for the post-Sabbatical year. One may not cement [the wall] with an earthen [mixture], but one may make a [rock] partition [without mortar]. Any stone which one can reach out with one's hand and take [while building], [such a stone as] this may be taken.",

Pile it in the public domain and use it for improvements; thus says Rabbi Yehoshua. Rabbi Akiva says, just as we don't put obstacles in the public thoroughfare, so too we do not make improvements to it. [Rather] what should be done with the soil?

The house of Shammai says the fruit of the seventh year may not be eaten while [expressing] gratitude [to the original owner], while the house of Hillel says they may be eaten either while [expressing] gratitude [to the original owner] or not.

But an old [rose] in new [oil] requires <i>Bi'ur</i>. New carobs that were pickled in old wine or old [carobs] in new [wine], require <i>Bi'ur</i>. This is the rule: anything [from the Sabbatical year] that is [of an amount that] transfers taste [to another food] requires <i>Bi'ur</i> [if] it is a species in a different species. But a species in its own species, for any amount [it requires <i>Bi'ur</i>]. The Sabbatical prohibitions apply to any amount of a species in its own species, and [in a case of a species] not in its own species, [they only apply] when [the amount is enough to] transfer taste.

And anything that is not specifically [considered] human food can be made into a plaster for people but not for animals. And anything that is neither specifically [considered] human food nor animal food: [if] he intended it [at the time of picking] to be both human food and animal food, it takes on the stringencies of human food and the stringencies of animal food. [If] he intended it for wood, it is considered wood [and can therefore only be used to feed fire].

Wages owed to a worker are not canceled, but if it was made into a loan, it is canceled.
