            "An unspecified pair of birds, from which one  flew off, or that flew among birds designated to die, or if one of the pair died, a second bird should be bought for the remaining bird.  If it flew off among birds that were set to be brought as sacrifices, it becomes invalid and invalidates its matching bird [the other bird of its pair], since a bird that flies away from its pair is invalid and makes its matching bird invalid. ",
            "How is it?  If there are two women, this one has two pairs and this one has two birds and one bird flew from this woman's [pair]  to the other woman's [pair] , it invalidates one bird by its leaving.  If it then returned [to its original pair] it invalidates one by returning.  If it flew back and forth multiple times it does not cause further invalidation since even if they are mixed up, there are at least two [valid] birds remaining. ",
            "If this one [woman] has one [pair of birds], and this one [woman] has two [pairs of birds], this one has three [pairs], this one has four [pairs], this one five [pairs], this one six [pairs] and this one seven [pairs], and one bird flew from the first [group] to the second ]group] and one [flew from the second group] into the third [group], and one [flew from the third group]into the fourth [group], and one [flew from the fourth group] into the fifth [group], and one [flew from the fifth group] into the sixth [group], and one [flew from the sixth group] into the seventh [group],  and then one returned [to its previous group], it invalidates one pair [for each woman] when it leaves and one pair [for each woman] upon its return.  [Therefore], the first and second [groups of women] have no valid birds left, the third [group] has one [valid pair], the fourth [group] has two [valid pairs], the fifth [group] has three[valid pairs],  the sixth [group] has four [valid pairs],  and the seventh [group] has six [valid pairs].  If it [a bird] flew back and fourth ]through the remaining sets of birds], it invalidates one set when it leaves and one set upon its return. [Therefore] the third and fourth [group] have nothing [no valid pairs], the fifth [group] has one [valid pair], the sixth [group]  has two [valid pairs] and the seventh [group] has five.  If a bird flew back and forth,  it invalidates one pair when it leaves and one upon its return.  The fifth and sixth [group] have no valid birds and the seventh [group] has four. Others say the seventh woman did not lose anything and if a bird that is left to die flew into their group they all must be left to die.  ",
            "An unspecified pair of birds [one of which is a burnt-offering and the other is a sin offering] and a pair of specified birds, if a bird from the unspecified birds flew into the pair of specified birds he [the owner] must bring a second bird for the second one [remaining unspecified bird].  Or if  a bird flew from the original specified birds [to the unspecified birds], they must all be left to die.",
            "If there were sin-offering [birds] on one side and burnt-offering [birds] on another side and [an] unspecified [pair] in the middle, and then from the middle [pair] one bird flew to one side and one bird to the other, he [the ownwe]  has not lost anything, rather he should say, the one [bird] that flew to the sin-offering should be a sin offering and the one [bird] that flew to the burnt offering should be a burnt-offering.  If they then returned to the middle,  the birds in the middle must be left to die, and these [the sin-offering birds] are to be brought as sin-offerings and these [the burnt offering birds] are to be brought as burn-offerings. If once again it [a bird] flew from the middle [back] to the sides, they must all be left to die.   One may not bring turtledoves paired with pigeons or pigeons  paired with turtledoves.  How so? A woman who brought as her sin-offering a turtledove and as her burnt-offering a pigeon, she must do it over and bring as her burnt-offering a turtledove. If she brought as her burnt-offering a turtledove and as her sin offering a pigeon she must do it over and bring for her burnt-offering a pigeon.  Ben Azzai said we follow whichever bird is offered first.   A woman who brought her sin-offering and died, her heirs must bring her burnt-offering. [If she brought] her burnt-offering and died, her heirs do not have to bring her sin offering. "

            "In what case are the previously stated [rulings] said?  If the <i>Kohen</i> consulted [the authorities about what to do when birds got mixed up].  But if the <i>Kohen</i> did not consult [the authorities], if there was one [pair] for this one [woman] and one [pair] for this one [woman] or two [pairs] for this one [woman] and two [pairs] for this one [woman] or three [pairs] for this one [woman] and three [pairs] for this one [woman], if he did all [the birds] above [the Altar's mid-line] half will be valid [offerings] and the other half will be invalid.  If he did all [the birds] below [the Altar's mid line], half will be valid and the other half will be invalid. [If he did] half above and half below, those done above half will be valid and the other half will be invalid, among those done below half will be valid and the other half will be invalid. ",
            "One [pair] from this one [woman] and two [pairs]  from this one [another woman] and three [pair]  from this one [another woman] and ten [pairs]  from this one [another woman] and one hundred [pairs]  from this one [another woman] if he [the <i> Kohen</i>] did all of them above [the Altar's mid-line], half are valid and half are invalid. If he did all of them below [the Altar's mid-line], half will be valid and the other half will be invalid. If he did half above and half below, the number of birds in the largest group are valid.  This is the rule: Any place [situation] where you can divide the pairs  so that one woman's birds will not be both above [the mid-line] and below [the mid-line] half will be valid and half will be invalid.  Any place [situation] where you cannot divide the pairs other than one woman's [birds] can be entirely above and below [the mid-line] the number of birds in the largest group are valid.",
            "The sin offering from this one [woman] and a burnt-offering from this one [woman], and he [the <i>Kohen</i> in error] did all of them above [the mid-line] half are valid and half are invalid.  If he [the <i>Kohen</i> in error] did all of them below [the mid-line], half are valid and half are invalid. If he  [the <i>Kohen</i> in error] did half above [the mid-line] and half below [the mid-line], both are invalid, because we can say that the sin-offering was brought above [the mid-line] and the burnt-offering was brought below [the mid-line]. ",
            "[If two women brought three pairs. [The first pair they specified one bird] as a sin-offering [and specified for which woman], [and the other] as a burnt-offering  [and specified for which woman], [the second pair they left] unspecified, [and the third pair they]  specified [the type of offering but did not specify for which woman], if he [the <i>Kohen</i> did all of them above [the mid-line of the Altar] half are valid and half are invalid.  If he [the <i>Kohen</i>] did all of them below [the mid-line of the Altar], half are valid and half are invalid.  If he did half above and half below only the unspecified birds are valid and they are split between them [the women].  ",
            "Sin-offering birds that  got mixed with an [equal number of] obligatory pairs [of sin-offerings and burnt offering] they are not valid, except for the number of sin-offering birds within the obligatory pairs.  If the number of obligatory pairs are twice as many as the sin-offering birds, half are valid and half are invalid.  If the sin-offering birds are twice as many as the obligatory [pairs] only the number of birds in the obligatory pairs are valid.  Similarly, a burnt-offering that got mixed with an obligatory pair only the number of burnt-offering birds in the obligatory pairs are valid.  If the number of obligatory [pairs] are twice as many as the burnt-offering [birds], half are valid and half are invalid.  If the burnt-offering [birds] are twice as many as the obligatory [birds] only the number [of birds] in the obligatory pairs are valid.",
            "A woman who said, I will bring a pair of birds when I give birth to a boy, if she gave birth to a boy she brings two pairs, one for her vow and one for her obligation.  When she gives them to <i>Kohen</i>, he [the <i>Kohen</i>] must do  three of the birds above [the mid-line  of the Alter] and three below. [If] he did not do so , but instead did two above and two below and did not ask [her the purpose of the offerings], she [the woman] must bring one more bird and he [the <i>Kohen</i>]  offers it above [the mid-line].  [This  is true]  if both birds were from the same species.  [If they were] of different species, she must bring two [additional] birds. If she specified [which species would be used for] her vow, she must bring three more birds of the same species, [this is the rule if they were all from] the same species.  [If they were] from two species she must bring four [additional] birds.  If she attached her vow to her obligatory offering, she must now bring five additional birds, if they were of one species, and six if they were from two species.  If she gave them to the <i>Kohen</i>, but did not know what species she gave to him and the <i>Kohen</i> brought the birds, but does not know how he brought them,  she must bring four more birds for her vow and two for her obligation and one as a sin-offering.  Ben Azzai says, she must bring two sin-offerings. Rabbi Yehoshua says:, This is [similar] to what is said,  when it[a ram]  is alive it has one voice, but once it's dead it has seven.  How does it have seven?  Its two horns can become two trumpets, its two thighs would become two flutes, its hide can become a drum, its stomach can become parts of lyres, its innards for harp strings, and some say its wool can be used for <i>Tekhelet</i> [blue-dyed wool used for tzitit  and priesty garments].  Rabbi Shimon son of Akashia said: Unlearned elderly men as they get older their mind gets more confused as it says (Job 12:20), \"He removes the speech of the capable and takes away the reasoning of the elders.\"  But the elders of Torah are not that way, rather as they get older their mind becomes more settled as it says (Job 12:12) \"In the aged is wisdom and in lengthy days understanding.\""
