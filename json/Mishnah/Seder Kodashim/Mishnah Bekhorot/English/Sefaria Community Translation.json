As it is written (Numbers 3:13): \"in Israel\", but not by others. Priests and Levites are also exempt, for if they could exempt a Israelite [while the Jewish people were] in the desert, then they would certainly exempt themselves.",
            "If a cow gives birth to [a creature which] looks like a donkey or a donkey gives birth to [a creature which] looks like a horse, it is exempt from the laws of the firstborn, for it is written (Exodus 34:20\": \"firstborn donkey\" and (Exodus 13:13) \"firstborn donkey\"--two times, [to teach that] the birthing [mother] must be a donkey, and the born [creature] must be a donkey. And what about eating them? If a pure species gives birth to [a creature which] looks like an impure species, it is permissible to eat [the offspring]; if an impure species gives birth to [a creature which] looks like a pure species, it is forbidden to eat [the offspring], for that which comes from an impure species is impure and that which comes from a pure species is pure. If an impure fish swallows a pure fish, [the pure fish found inside] is permissible to eat; if a pure fish swallows an impure fish, [the impure fish found inside] is forbidden to eat, for it is not its product.",

[If it gives birth to] a male and a female, one sets apart a lamb for oneself. If two donkeys that both have not previously given birth now give birth to two males, one must give two lambs to a priest. [If they give birth to] a male and a female, or to two males and a female, one must give a lamb to a priest. [If they give birth to] two females and a male, or two males and two females, the priest gets nothing.",

[If they gave birth to] a male and a female, one sets apart a lamb for oneself. A firstborn donkey is redeemed with a lamb, [whether the lamb or kid is] from sheep or goats, male or female, large or small, perfect or blemished. One can use it to redeem many times, and if it dies one can benefit from it.",
            "One may redeem neither with a calf, nor with an undomesticated animal, nor with a slaughtered animal, nor with a <i>treifah</i> [animal which cannot live another 12 months], or with a mixed species [i.e., from sheep and goat parents], nor with a <i>koi</i> [animal of ambiguous status, exhibiting characteristics of wild and domesticated animals]. Rabbi El'azar permits [redeeming] with a mixed species because it is still [considered] a lamb; But he forbids a <i>koi</i>, because it is of doubtful [status]. If one gives a donkey to a priest, the priest does not have permission to keep it, until [the priest] separates a lamb for it.",
            "If one separates the redemption for a firstborn donkey, and it dies, Rabbi Eli'ezer says: One is liable for it, just like the five <i>selaim</i> [coins of a specific value] for [the redemption of] a son. The sages say: One is not liable for it, just like the redemption of <i>Maaser Sheini</i> [second tithe of produce, which must be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there]. Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Tzadok testified regarding the redemption of a firstborn donkey that died, that the priest receives nothing in such a case. If a firstborn donkey dies, Rabbi Eliezer says: It is buried and it is permissible to benefit from the lamb. The Sages say: One need not bury it, and the lamb goes to the priest.",
            "If one does not want to redeem it, one breaks its neck from behind with an ax and buries it. The commandment of redeeming it precedes the commandment of breaking its neck, as it is written (Exodus 13:13, Exodus 34:20) \"If you will not redeem it, break its neck.\" The commandment of designating it precedes the commandment of redeeming it, as it is written (Exodus 21:8): \"That you have not designated it -it shall be redeemed.\" The commandment of Levirate marriage preceded the commandment of <i>chalitzah</i> [ceremony releasing the widow of a childless man from the obligation to marry his brother] at first, when they had intention for the sake of the commandment, but now that they do not have intention for the sake of the commandment, we say that the commandment of <i>chalitzah</i> precedes the commandment of Levirate marriage. The commandment of redeeming [an animal devoted to general Temple usage] is on the master before any other person, as it is written (Leviticus 27:27): \"If it is not redeemed, it shall be sold for its estimated worth.\""

            "If one buys an animal from a non-Jew and it is not known whether it had given birth or had not given birth, Rabbi Yishma'el says: [The offspring of] a goat in its first year certainly belongs to the priest. From that point on it is questionable. [The offspring of] a two-year-old ewe certainly belongs to the priest. From that point on it is questionable. [The offspring] of a three-year-old cow or donkey certainly belongs to the priest. From that point on it is questionable. Rabbi Akiva said to him: If an animal were exempted only with the birth of offspring, you would be correct. Rather they said: The sign of offspring in small cattle is filth [from the womb]. In large cattle [the sign is] the after-birth. In a woman [the sign is] the fetus and the after-birth. This is the general rule: When it is known that [the animal] has given birth, the priest receives nothing. When it has never given birth, it belongs to the priest. If there is a doubt, it is eaten blemished by the owners. Rabbi Eli'ezer ben Jacob says: If a large domestic animal discharges a clot of blood, [the clot] is buried, and [the mother] is exempt from [the obligations of] the firstborn. ",

If one entered his pen and saw those who had previously given birth nursing and those that had not previously given birth nursing, he need not be concerned that the child of this mother is nursing from that mother or that the child of that mother is nursing from this mother.

Rabbi Yossi says: It is not in this case that Akavya permits it. Rather, when the hair of a blemished firstborn falls out and one places it in the window and then it dies, 'Akavya ben Mahalalel permits it but the Sages forbid it. The wool hanging off a firstborn that appears [as though it is] from shearing is permitted. [Wool] that does not appear [as though it is] from the shearing is forbidden.  "

            "How long must an Israelite tend to the first born? Thirty days for a sheep or goat, and fifty days for a cow. Rabbi Yossi says: Three months for a sheep or goat. If the priest says to [the owner] during that time: \"Give it to me\", [the owner] does not give it to [the priest].  If it was blemished and [the priest] says to [the owner]: \"Give it to me so I can eat it\", it is permitted [to give it to the priest]. During the time of the Temple, if it is unblemished, and [the priest] says to [the owner]: \"Give it to me so I can offer it\", it is permitted [to give it to the priest]. The first born is eaten year by year, whether unblemished or blemished, as it is said (Deuteronomy 15:20): \"You will eat it before God year by year\". ",

            "If one slaughters a first born and reveals its blemish, Rabbi Yehudah permits it [to be eaten]. Rabbi Meir says: Since it was not slaughtered by word of an expert, it is forbidden.",

If one judges a case and declared a liable [animal] innocent, an innocent [animal] liable, a pure [animal] impure, or an impure [animal] pure, what is done is done, and one pays from one's own funds. If one is an expert of the court one is exempt from paying. It once happened that Rabbi Tarfon fed a cow whose womb was taken out to the dogs. The case came before the Sages and they permitted it. Todos the doctor said: No cow or pig leaves Alexandria until they cut out its womb so it cannot give birth. Rabbi Tarfon [then] said: Your donkey has left you, Tarfon! Rabbi 'Akiva said to him: Rabbi Tarfon, you are exempt because you are an expert of the court, and experts of the court are exempt from payment.  ",

[If one takes a fee] to sprinkle [ashes of the red heifer] or to mix [them with water], the water is like cave water and the ashes are the ashes of a regular fire. If a priest was made impure to eat <i>Terumah</i> [by the one who took the fee], one must feed him, give him drink and anoint him. If the person was old, one must transport him on a donkey give him his wages like a worker [idled from his work]. ",

One who is suspect regarding tithes is not automatically suspect regarding <i>Shevi'it</i>. One who is suspect on both is suspect on regarding purity. There is one who is suspect regarding purity but is not suspect regarding either of the others. The rule is that anyone who is suspect regarding something may not judge or give testimony about it. "

If a firstborn is seized by [excess] blood, we do not let its blood even if it will die, according to Rabbi Yehudah. The sages say: One may let its blood, but one may not make a blemish.  If one did make a blemish, one cannot slaughter it on that [basis].  Rabbi Shim'on says: One should let its blood even if he will make a blemish. ",
            "If one slits the ear of a firstborn it may never be slaughtered, according to Rabbi Eli'ezer. The sages say: Once it develops another blemish it may be slaughtered on that [basis]. It once happened that a Roman official saw an old ram with its wool matted and asked: \"What is with this one?\" They answered: \"It is a firstborn and it may not be slaughtered unless it develops a blemish.\" He took a dagger and slit its ear. It came before the sages, and they permitted it. Once he saw that [the sages] permitted it, he went and made slits in the ears of other firstborns, and [the sages] forbade them. It once happened that children were playing in a field, and they tied the tails of two lambs to each other. One of the tails, belonging to a firstborn, was detached. This case came before the sages and they permitted it. Once [the people] saw that [the sages] permitted it, [the people] went and tied the tails of other firstborns together, but [the sages] forbade them.

Israelite shepherds are trusted [regarding] all blemishes which could come about by human [causation] but priests [who are] shepherds are not trusted.  Rabban Shim'on ben Gamliel says: [The priest] is trusted regarding [the firstborn of] a friend but is not trusted regarding [the priest's] own.

Of what was not eaten, the meat should be buried, and one must return the money. Similarly, if one slaughters and sells a cow, and then becomes informed that it was torn, what was eaten was eaten and one must return the money.

[Who is a <i>ba'al pikah</i>?] If a bunion extends from his thumb or big toe. [If] his heel juts out backward, or if his sole is as wide as that of a goose.  If his fingers or toes lie on top of each other, or they are webbed up to the joint - he is valid; beyond the joint and he cut it - he is valid.  If he had an extra [digit] and he cut it off, if there was a bone in it, he is invalid, but if not he is valid.  If he had extra [digits] on his hands and feet - [if he has] six digits each [for a total of] twenty-four, Rabbi Yehuda validates him, but the Sages invalidate him.  One who is ambidextrous - Rabbi [Yehudah HaNasi] invalidates him but the sages validate him.  A dark-skinned person, or red-skinned or an albino or a very tall person or a dwarf or a deaf-mute or a <i>shoteh</i>, or one who is drunk or one who has lesions [deemed] pure, these invalidate a person but are valid for an animal.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:  An insane animal is not considered choice [for sacrificial use], Rabbi Eliezer says also those with dangling [appendages of] flesh - this is invalid in a person but valid for an animal.

One and one's child [one the same day], a <i>treifah</i> [possession an organic condition which will cause death within one year], one born through cesarean section, (or if a sin [of bestiality] was committed with or by them or if it killed a person).  One who marries women who are forbidden to him is unfit until he takes a vow not to receive benefit from her.  One who touches dead bodies is invalid until he accepts upon himself to not touch dead bodies."

Who is a firstborn for the portion and the priest?  One who miscarries a fetal sac full of blood, water, or worm[like tissue], or if she miscarried [something that] resembles fish, locust, insects or reptiles, or one who miscarries on [or before] the fortieth day, the one that comes after them is a firstborn for the portion and the priest.

If the father died within thirty days it is assumed [the son] was not redeemed until he brings proof that he was redeemed.  After thirty days, it is assumed he was redeemed until (they testify) that he was not redeemed.  If he has to redeem [both] himself and his son - he comes before his son.

            "The animal tithe applies both in Israel and outside Israel, both when the Temple stands and when the Temple does not exist, for non-sacred animals but not for sacred animals.  And it applies to cattle and flock [i.e., sheep and goats], but they cannot be tithed one for the other.  [It applies to] sheep and goats, and they may be tithed one for the other.  It applies to both new and old animals but they are not tithed one for the other.  Because we could have said: If old and new animals which do not make a mixed breed, are not tithed one for the other, all the more so sheep and goats,  which do create a mixed breed, certainly should not be tithed one for the other! Therefore it says (Leviticus 27) \"and flock\" which means all [types of] flock [animals] are one. ",
            "Tithed animals join together as long as they are within grazing distance [of one another].  And what is grazing distance? Sixteen [Roman] miles.  If there was between these [animals] and these [animals] thirty-two mils, they do not combine.  If [however] he had one [animal] in the middle he brings them into the middle and tithes them. Rabbi Meir says: the [river] Jordan is divides for matters of tithing animals. ",

[Orphaned] brothers [who are are still] partners who are obligated in the <i>kalbon</i> [surcharge added, in certain cases, to the yearly half-shekel Temple dues] are exempt from the animal tithe and those who are obligated in the animal tithe are exempt from the <i>kalbon</i>.  If they bought it with what they inherited they are obligated but if not they are exempt.  If they divided [their jointly-held inheritance] and then became partners once again, they are obligated in the <i>kalbon</i> but exempt from the animal tithe. ",

When its mother has died during its birth or was slaughtered [and subsequently gave birth.]  Rabbi Joshua says: even if its mother has been slaughtered, if the [mother's] hide is still intact the offspring is not an orphan.",
            "There are three <i>granot</i> [calving season cut-off date, after which it is prohibited to sell or slaughter, before tithing them, animals born during that period]for animal tithes: before Pesach, before Shavuot and before Sukkot, [these are] the words of Rabbi Akiva.  Ben Azzai says: on the twenty-ninth of Adar, on the first of Sivan and on the twenty-ninth of Av.  Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: on the first of Nisan, on the first of Sivan and on the twenty-ninth of Elul.  And why did they say the twenty-ninth of Elul and not the first of Tishrei?    Because it is a holy day and it is impossible to tithe on a holy day. Therefore, they moved it up to the twenty-ninth of Elul.  Rabbi Meir says: the first of Elul is the New Year for the animal tithe.    Ben Azzai says: those born in Elul are tithed by themselves. ",
            "All animals born from the first of Tishrei till the 29th of Elul joint together [for tithing].  Five from before Rosh Hashanah and five from after Rosh Hashanah do not join together.  Five before a <i>goren</i> and five after <i>goren</i> join together.  If so why did they say there are three <i>granot</i> for the animal tithe?  Because until the <i>goren</i> has arrived, it is permitted to sell and slaughter [without tithing], once it has arrived one may not slaughter [without tithing] but if he did, he is exempt [from punishment].",
            "How does one tithe animals?  He brings them to a pen and makes for them a small opening so that two cannot go out at the same time.  And he counts them with a rod: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  And the one that comes out tenth he marks with red chalk and he says: “Behold, this is the tithe.”  If he did not mark it, or if he did not count them with a rod, or if he counted them while they were crouching or standing [still], they are [nevertheless] tithed.  If he had one hundred [lambs] and he took ten or if he had ten and he took one [without counting], this is not [a valid] tithe.    Rabbi Yose bar Judah says: this is a [valid] tithe.  If one of the [animals] already counted jumped back into the [uncounted] flock, they are all exempt. If one of the [animals] already tithed [jumped back] into the flock, they all go to pasture until they become blemished, and [then] the owners may eat them due to their blemish.  ",
            "If two came out at the same time, he counts them two at a time.    If he counted [the two] as one, the ninth and the tenth are spoiled.    If the ninth and the tenth came out at the same time, the ninth and the tenth are spoiled. If he called the ninth \"tenth\", the tenth \"ninth\" and the eleventh \"tenth\", all three are holy: the ninth may be eaten when it becomes blemished, the tenth is the tithe and the eleventh is sacrificed as a <i>shelamim</i> offering, and it can make a <i>temurah</i>- [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Judah said: can one <i>temurah</i> make another <i>temurah</i>?  They said in the name of Rabbi Meir: if it were a <i>temurah</i>, it would not have been sacrificed. If he called the ninth \"tenth\", tenth \"tenth\" and the eleventh \"tenth\", the eleventh is not holy.   The following is the general rule: wherever the name of the tenth [animal] has not been uprooted, the eleventh is not holy.  "
