            "Everyone can substitute a dedicated animal for another, both men and women. Not that a one is allowed to substitute, but rather, that if he did substitute, the substitution takes effect, and he absorbs forty lashes. Priests can substitute their own [offerings] and Israelites can substitute their [own offerings]. Priests cannot substitute for <i>chata'ot</i> [sin-offerings], or <i>Ashamot</i> [guilt-offerings], or for the firstborn. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri said: Why can they not substitute it for a firstborn? Rabbi Akiva said to him: the <i>Chatat</i> and <i>Asham</i> are gifts to the priest and the firstborn is a gift to the priest, just as he cannot substitute for the <i>Chatat</i> and <i>Asham</i>, so too he cannot substitute a for a first-born. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri said to him: But why does it matter that he cannot substitute for the <i>Chatat</i> and <i>Asham</i>? He does not have rights to them while they are alive -  should the same law apply to the firstborn, to which he has rights while it is alive? Rabbi Akiva responded to him: Does it not say (Leviticus 27:10): \"It and its substitution will be holy\"? Where does holiness takes effect [on a dedicated animal? While it is] in the owners possession; so too the substitution must be [while the animal is] in the owner's possession.",
            "Cattle can be substituted for sheep and sheep for cattle, sheep for goats and goats for sheep, males for females and females for males, unblemished [animals] for blemished [animals] and blemished ones for unblemished ones, as it says (Leviticus 27:10): \"Do not switch it and do not substitute it - good for bad or bad for good.\" What is 'good for bad'? Blemished ones whose sanctification preceded their blemish. One [animal] can be substituted for two, and two for one, one for one hundred, and one hundred for one. Rabbi Shimon says: We only substitute one for one, as it says (Leviticus 27:10): \"it and its substitution\" - just as 'it' is particular so too its substitution is particular.",
            "We do not substitute limbs for fetuses nor fetuses for limbs, and neither limbs nor fetuses for intact animals, nor  intact animals for them. Rabbi Yose says: Limbs can be substituted for intact animals, but not intact animals for limbs. [for] Rabbi Yose said: And is it not the law regarding sanctified animals that if one says: the leg of this one is an <i>Olah</i> [burnt-offering], all of it [becomes an <i>Olah</i>? So too, if one says the leg of this one in place of that one, all of it is an substitution in its place.",
            "<i>Meduma</i> (a mixture of <i>terumah</i> and non-sacred food) does not render [its admixture] <i>meduma</i> except according to reckoning [i.e., the amount of <i>terumah</i> in the initial mixture], and leavened foodstuffs [leavened by leavening which  is <i>terumah</i>] does not render [its admixture] <i>chamets</i> except according to reckoning, and drawn water does not render a <i>mikveh</i> invalid except according to reckoning.",
            "The purification-water cannot become purification-water except through the deposition of ash. A field in doubt [as to whether it contains a grave] cannot create a [secondary] field of the same status, tithes cannot come after other tithes, and an substituted animal cannot make a substituted animal, and the offspring [of a dedicated animal] cannot make a substituted animal. Rabbi Judah says: The offspring can make a substituted animal. They said to him: Dedicated animals can make a substituted animal , but neither the offspring [of a dedicated animal] nor a substituted animal can make a substituted animal.",
            "The bird [offerings] and the flour-offerings cannot make a substitution, for [the rule of substitution] was only stated regarding animals. Neither the public nor [business] partners can created a substitution, for it is said (Leviticus 27:10): \"He shall not substitute it\" - an individual can create an substitution but neither the public nor partners can create a substitution. Offerings [donated] to the maintenance fund of the Temple cannot create a substitution. Rabbi Shimon said: Wasn't the tithe [animal] included in the rule [for substituted animals]? Why did it leave [the rule to be dealt with separately]? [In order] to compare [to it]: Just as the tithe is the offering of an individual, [so too are all subject offerings the offering of an individual] - public offerings are excluded. Just as the tithe is an offering for the altar, [so too are all subject offerings offerings for the altar] - offerings [donated] to the maintenance fund of the Temple  are excluded."

            "There are [aspects] of individual sacrifices  which are not [aspects] of public sacrifices, and there are [aspects] of public sacrifices which are not [aspects] of individual sacrifices, [namely,] that individual sacrifices can make a substituted animal, and public sacrifices cannot make a substituted animal; Individual sacrifices can be made with male or female [animals], and public sacrifices can only be made with males; [regarding] individual sacrifices and their libations,  one is financially liable, [while regarding] public sacrifices and their libations, one is not financially liable. However, once is financially liable for their libations once the sacrifice has been offered. There are [aspects] of public sacrifices  which are not [aspects] of individual sacrifices, [namely,]that [offering] public sacrifices sets aside Shabbat [prohibitions] and [priestly] impurity, and individual sacrifices do  set aside neither Shabbat [prohibitions] nor [priestly] impurity. Rabbi Meir said: and are not the High Priest's grain-offering and [his] cow-offering on Yom Kippur individual sacrifices, yet they set aside Shabbat [prohibitions] and [priestly] impurity? Rather, [the reason that certain offering set aside Shabbat and impurity is] because their time [for their offering] is fixed.",
            "An individual's <i>chattat</i> [sin-offering]  whose owners atoned [otherwise, i.e., via another sin-offering] is [secluded until it] dies; the public's <i>chattat</i> [of similar circumstances] is not [secluded until it] dies. Rabbi Yehuda said: they will [both be secluded until they] die. Rabbi Shimon said: what do we find regarding the offspring of a <i>chattat</i>, and the substitute for a <i>chattat</i>, and a <i>chattat</i> whose owner has died? These matters were spoken of regarding an individual [<i>chattat</i>], but not regarding a public [<i>chattat</i>] - likewise, regarding a <i>chattat</i>  whose owners atone [otherwise] and <i>chattat</i> which has passed one year [of age], these matters were spoken of regarding an individual [<i>chattat</i>], but not regarding a public [<i>chattat</i>].",
            "[Original] holy [sacrifices] are more stringent [in some ways] than a substitute, and a substitute is [more stringent] than [original] holy [sacrifices] , as [original] holy [sacrifices] can make a substitute, yet a substitute cannot make a substitute. The public and partners can dedicate an animal, but they cannot substitute, and [one can] dedicate limbs and fetuses, but one cannot substitute [for them]. A substitute is more stringent, [in that] the holiness [imposed by the act of substitution] applies [even] to an animal with a permanent blemish, and it cannot be redeemed to be sheared or worked. Rabbi Yose bar Rabbi Yehuda said: They equated unintentional [action] with intentional action regarding substitution, but not with regards to [dedicating original] holy [sacrifices]. Rabbi Eliezer said: <i>Kilayim</i> [the products of forbidden crossbreeding], <i>terefot</i> [animals with a mortal condition such that they would die within one year], those born via Caesarian section, the <i>tumtum</i> [person (or animal) with recessed sexual organs whose gender is therefore impossible to determine, presently, by external examination. It is halachically uncertain whether such is male or female], or the <i>androginos</i> [person (or animal) with both male and female sexual organs. It is halachically uncertain whether such is male, female or, perhaps, has a uniquely defined halachic gender] - they neither can become sacred [offerings] nor [where already sacred] can they make [other animals] sacred [via substitution].

            "These are the holy [sacrifices] whose offspring and substitutions [are offered and thus] are similar to them: the offspring of a <i>shelamim</i> [An offering whose various parts are consumed by its owners, the Kohanim and the fire on the altar], and those exchanged for it, their offspring and their offspring's offspring until the end of the world, behold they are like <i>shelamim</i>, and they require <i>semichah</i> [placing both hands  on the head of a sacrificial animal and leaning with all once's force, an action required for many sacrifices] and libations and waving and [giving] the breast and the leg [to the priests]. Rabbi Eliezer says: the offspring of a <i>shelamim</i> is not offered as a <i>shelamim</i>, [while] the Sages say: it is offered. Rabbi Shimon said: they did not disagree about the offspring of the offspring of a <i>shelamim</i> or about the offspring of the offspring of a substitute, that it is not offered. Regarding what did they disagree? [Regarding the immediate] offspring: Rabbi Eliezer says: it is not offered, and the Sages said: it is offered. Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Pappis testified regarding the offspring of a <i>shelamim</i> that it is offered as a <i>shelamim</i>. Rabbi Pappis said: I testify that we had a cow offered as a <i>shelamim</i> which we ate on [the day of] Pesach, and we ate its offspring as a <i>shelamim</i> during the [ensuing] holiday.",
            "The offspring of a <i>todah</i> [thanksgiving offering] and its substitute, its offspring and the offspring of its offspring until the end of the world, behold these are like a <i>todah</i>, except they do not require [the accompanying] bread [offerings]. The substitute for an <i>olah</i> [offering that is entirely burnt], the offspring of that substitute, and the offspring of its offspring until the end of the world, behold they are like the <i>olah</i>, and require skinning,  sectioning and are [consigned] entirely to the fire.",
            "One who designated a female [animal] as an <i>olah</i> and it gives birth to a male, shall graze until it becomes blemished, and shall be sold and he shall bring an <i>olah</i> with its money. Rabbi Eliezer said: the offspring itself is offered an <i>olah</i>. One who designated a female as an <i>asham</i> [offering brought to alleviate guilt], let it graze until it becomes blemished, and then let it be sold and he shall bring an <i>asham</i> with its money. If he [already] offered his <i>asham</i>, its money falls [to the Temple fund] for a free-will offering. Rabbi Shimon said: it is sold though not blemished. The substitute for an <i>asham</i>, and the offspring of the exchange, and the offspring of the offspring until the end of the world, are left to graze until they becomes blemished, and are then sold and their money falls [to the Temple fund] for a free-will offering. Rabbi Eliezer said:  [they shall be secluded until] they die. And Rabbi Eleazar said: he shall bring <i>olot</i> with their money. An <i>asham</i> whose owners have died, or whose owners have atoned [using another animal] shall graze until they become blemished and they shall be sold, and their money falls [to the Temple fund] for a free-will offering. Rabbi Eliezer said: [they shall be secluded until] they die. And Rabbi Eleazar said: he shall bring <i>olot</i> with their money.",
            "But is not a free-will offering also an <i>olah</i>? [Then] what is there between the words of Rabbi Eleazar and the words of the Sages? Rather, when [an <i>olah</i>] is brought as an obligation, he lays his hands on it and bring [accompanying] libations, [for] its libations [come] from his own [funds]. And if he is a priest, its [sacrificial work and skin are his; [but] when it is brought as a free-will offering, he does not lay his hands on it, and he does not bring libations, for its libations [come] from the public. Even if he is a priest, its [sacrificial] work and skin are [given] to the priest of [that day's] watch.",

What is the difference between the firstborn and the tithe and all the [other] holy [sacrifices]? All the [other] holy [sacrifices] are sold in the meat marketplace, and are slaughtered in the meat marketplace, and are weighed on a scale - except for the firstborn and the tithe; they are redeemed [when blemished], and their substitutes are redeemed - except for the firstborn and the tithe; they [may] come from outside the Land [of Israel] - except for the firstborn and the tithe, [but] if they [nevertheless] came [from outside the Land of Israel, if] unblemished, they are offered; and if blemished, they shall be eaten due to their blemishes by their owners. Rabbi Shimon said: what is the reason? The firstborn and the tithe have a provision [if they become blemished] in their place; all the [other] holy [sacrifices], should they become blemished, they remain holy [and cannot be provided for outside the Land of Israel]."
