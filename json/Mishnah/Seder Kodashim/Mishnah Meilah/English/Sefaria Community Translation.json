            "[Offerings of]<i> Kodshei kodashim</i> [sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity, they may be slaughtered only on the north-west corner of the altar, and consumed only within the Temple compound by male priests, or burnt entirely.]  that were slaughtered in the south [of the Temple Courtyard]  one is liable for  <i> me'ilah</i> [misuse of consecrated property]. If they were slaughtered in the south [side], but their blood was gathered in the north [side]; if they were slaughtered in the north, but their blood was gathered in the south; if they were  slaughtered during the day, and their blood was sprinkled at night; [if they were slaughtered] at night, and their blood was sprinkled during the day; or one slaughtered them [with the intent to eat it] after its [designated] time or outside its [permitted] place,  one is liable for <i> me'ilah</i>.  Rabbi Yehoshua stated a general rule: Any [offering] that had even a brief period of time when it was permitted to the <i>kohanim</i> [priests], one is not liable for <i> me'ilah</i>. [However] anything which did not have a brief period of time when they were  permitted to the <i>kohanim</i>, one is liable for <i> me'ilah</i>. What is it [an example of a sacrifice] that had a brief permitted time  to the <i>kohanim</i>? If it was left past its [permitted] time, or which became impure, or went out [was removed from the Temple Courtyard]. What is it [an example of a sacrifice] that did not have a brief permitted time to the <i>kohanim</i>? If it was slaughtered [with the invalid intent to eat it] beyond its [designated] time or outside its [permitted] place, or an invalid one [<i>kohen</i>] gathered and sprinkled its blood.",
            "The meat of <i> Kodshei kodashim</i> [sacrifices] that was removed [from the Courtyard] before their blood was sprinkled, Rabbi Eliezer says: One is liable for <i> me'ilah</i> but   they are not liable for <i>pigul</i> [a sacrifice that becomes unfit due to the intention to be eaten beyond its time], <i>notar</i> [a sacrifice that was leftover beyond the time of consumption] and <i>tamei</i> [a sacrifice that becomes unfit because it became defiled]. Rabbi Akiva says: One is not liable for <i> me'ilah</i>,  but they are  liable for  <i>pigul</i>, <i>notar</i> and <i>tamei</i>. Rabbi Akiva said: Why in the case when someone sets aside a sin offering and it got lost and he then sets aside another one in its place [and it was slaughtered], and then the first one was found [and was slaughtered], and now they [the blood] of both are in front of us [ready to be sprinkled], is it not so that just as the  [sprinkling] the blood of the first one  exempts its meat [from <i>me'ilah</i>], so too it should exempt the meat of the second one? And if the [sprinkling] of the blood of one exempts the meat of  the other one from  <i> me'ilah</i>, is it not logical [through  fortiori reasoning] that it should exempt its own meat [from <i>me'ilah</i>].",
            "The limbs of  [sacrifices] <i> kodashim kalim</i> [sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, they may be slaughtered anywhere in the Temple courtyard and consumed by most anyone, anywhere in Jerusalem] that were removed [out of the Courtyard] before the sprinking of the blood, Rabbi Eliezer says, one is not liable for <i> me'ilah</i>  and one is not liable for <i>pigul</i>, <i>notar</i> and <i>tamei</i>. Rabbi Akiva says one is liable for <i> me'ilah</i>  and  is liable for  <i>pigul</i>, <i>notar</i> and <i>tamei</i>.",
            "The of sprinkling the blood of  <i>kodshei kodashim</i> may have  a lenient [affect] and a stringent [affect], but with <i>kodashim kalim</i>, it affects them all stringently. How so? [With respect to] <i>kodshei kodashim</i>, before the sprinkling of the blood, the laws of <i> me'ilah</i> apply to both the limbs [of the animal to be burned on the altar] and the meat; after the sprinkling of the blood, the laws of <i> me'ilah</i> apply to the limbs but the laws of <i> me'ilah</i> do not apply to the meat. With respect to this [limbs] and this [meat], one is liable for <i>pigul</i>, <i>notar</i> and <i>tamei</i>. It is thus evident that the sprinkling of the blood  has a lenient and stringent affect. [But with respect to] <i>kodashim kalim</i> it has only a stringent affect. How so? <i>Kodashim kalim</i>, before the sprinkling of the blood, the laws of <i> me'ilah</i> do not apply neither to the  limbs  nor to the meat. After sprinkling of the blood, the laws of <i> me'ilah</i> apply to the limbs, but the laws of <i> me'ilah</i> do not apply to the meat. With respect to this [limbs] and this [meat],  one is liable for <i>pigul</i>, <i>notar</i> and <i>tamei</i>. It is thus evident, that with respect to <i>kodashim kalim</i>, it has only a stringent effect. "

If they are loose he [the money changer] may use them, therefore if he spent them he has not violated <i>meilah</i>.  [If he deposited the money] with private owner, in either case he [the private owner] may not use them.  Therefore if he spent [the money], he [the private owner] violated <i>meilah</i>. A storekeeper is considered a private owner, says Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Yehudah says, he is considered a money changer. ",
            "If a <i>peruta</i> belonging to the Temple fell into one's pouch or if he said that a <i>peruta</i> that is in this pouch  belongs to the Temple [thus mixing it with his private coins], as soon as he takes out the first one [<i>peruta</i>], he has violated <i>meilah</i>,  so says Rabbi Akiva.  The Sages say he has not violated <i>meilah</i> until he has spent all the coins in the pouch.  Rabbi Akiva [however] agrees with the Sages in the case where he said one <i>peruta</i> that is in this pouch belongs to the Temple, that he can spend the coins until he has spent the entire contents of the pouch [before committing <i>meilah</i>].
