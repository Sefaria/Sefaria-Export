            "When one brings a meal offering to the Temple, the priest removes a handful from it, places the handful into a service vessel, conveys it to the altar, and burns it. At that point, the remainder is permitted to the priests for consumption and the owner has fulfilled his obligation. In this context, the mishna teaches: <b>All the meal offerings</b> from <b>which a handful was removed not for their sake</b> but for the sake of another meal offering <b>are fit</b> for sacrifice. <b>But</b> these offerings <b>did not satisfy the obligation of the owner,</b> who must therefore bring another offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all meal offerings <b>except for the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy,</b> which is brought as part of the rite of a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>]. In those cases, if the priest removed the handful not for its own sake, the offering is disqualified. With regard to <b>the meal offering of a sinner and the meal offering of jealousy</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful not for their sake,</b> or where <b>he placed</b> a handful from them <b>in a vessel, or conveyed</b> the handful to the altar, <b>or burned</b> the handful on the altar, <b>not for their sake, or for their sake and not for their sake, or not for their sake and for their sake,</b> they <b>are disqualified.</b> The mishna elaborates: <b>How</b> are these rites performed <b>for their sake and not for their sake?</b> It is in a case where one removed the handful with two intentions: <b>For the sake of the meal offering of a sinner and for the sake of a voluntary meal offering.</b> How are these rites performed <b>not for their sake and for their sake?</b> It is in a case where one removed the handful with two intentions: <b>For the sake of a voluntary meal offering and for the sake of the meal offering of a sinner.</b>",
            "<b>Both the meal offering of a sinner and all</b> other <b>meal offerings</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the one who <b>removed their handful</b> was <b>a non-priest,</b> or a priest who was <b>an acute mourner,</b> i.e., whose relative died and was not yet buried, or a priest who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and was waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed, or a priest <b>lacking</b> the requisite priestly <b>vestments,</b> or a priest <b>who had not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, or a priest <b>who did not wash his hands and feet</b> from the water in the Basin prior to performing the Temple service, or <b>an uncircumcised</b> priest, or <b>a ritually impure</b> priest, or a priest who removed the handful while <b>sitting,</b> or while <b>standing</b> not on the floor of the Temple but <b>upon vessels,</b> or <b>upon an animal,</b> or <b>upon the feet of another</b> person; in all these cases the meal offerings are <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice. If the priest <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand the meal offering is <b>unfit. Ben Beteira says: He must return</b> the handful to the vessel that contains the meal offering <b>and again remove the handful,</b> this time <b>with</b> his <b>right</b> hand. If a priest <b>removed the handful</b> of flour, <b>and a stone, a grain of salt, or a pinch [<i>koret</i>] of frankincense emerged in his hand,</b> the meal offering is <b>unfit due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said: The handful that is outsized or that is lacking</b> is <b>unfit.</b> The existence of one of these foreign items in the handful means that the requisite measure of flour is lacking. <b>And which is the outsized</b> handful? It is one <b>where he removed the handful overflowing [<i>mevoratz</i>]</b> in a manner in which his fingers do not hold the flour. <b>And</b> which is the <b>lacking</b> handful? It is one <b>where he removed the handful with the tips of his fingers.</b> <b>How does</b> the priest <b>perform</b> the removal of a handful? <b>He extends his fingers onto the palm of his hand.</b> ",
            "If <b>one increased its oil, decreased its oil,</b> or <b>decreased its frankincense,</b> beyond the appropriate measures, the meal offering is <b>unfit.</b> With regard to <b>one who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake</b> of <b>its remainder outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or</b> to partake of <b>an olive-bulk of its remainder outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>to burn its handful outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or</b> to burn <b>an olive-bulk</b> of <b>its handful outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>or to burn its frankincense outside</b> the Temple courtyard, in all these cases the offering is <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i></b> for one who partakes of <b>it.</b> If one had the intent <b>to partake</b> of <b>its remainder on the next day or</b> to partake of <b>an olive-bulk of its remainder on the next day, to burn its handful on the next day or</b> to burn <b>an olive-bulk of its handful on the next day, or to burn</b> its <b>frankincense on the next day,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of the remainder of that meal offering. <b>This is the principle:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who removes the handful, or places</b> the handful <b>in the vessel,</b> or <b>who conveys</b> the vessel with the handful to the altar, or <b>who burns</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, e.g., the remainder, <b>or to burn an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>burns</b> it on the altar, e.g., the handful or the frankincense, <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the meal offering is <b>unfit but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>.</b> If his intent was to do so <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> on account of it, provided that the permitting</b> factor, i.e., the handful, <b>was sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b> If the permitting factor was not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva, although the meal offering is unfit, the prohibition of <i>piggul</i> does not apply to it. <b>How</b> is <b>the permitting factor</b> considered to have been <b>sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva?</b> If one <b>removed the handful in silence,</b> i.e., with no specific intent, and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> with the intent to partake of the or burn the handful or frankincense <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, and conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar <b>in silence,</b> with no specific intent; <b>or</b> if one <b>removed the handful</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>in the vessel, conveyed</b> it, <b>and burned</b> the handful on the altar, with the intent to partake of the remainder <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, that is</b> the case of an offering <b>whose permitting factor was sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva,</b> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for partaking of it due to <i>piggul</i>.",

            "In the case of a priest <b>who removes a handful from the meal offering</b> with the intent <b>to partake of its remainder or to burn its handful</b> on <b>the next day, Rabbi Yosei concedes in this</b> instance <b>that it is</b> a case of <b><i>piggul</i> and he is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of <b>it.</b> But if the priest’s intent was <b>to burn its frankincense the next day, Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The meal offering is <b>unfit but</b> partaking of it <b>does not include</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i>.

            "On <i>Shavuot</i> there is an obligation to sacrifice burnt offerings, a sin offering, and peace offerings together with the offering of the two loaves. The burnt offerings consists of a bull, two rams, and seven sheep. A goat is brought for the sin offering. Two sheep are brought as peace offerings and waved together with the two loaves. Failure to sacrifice <b>the bull, the rams, and the sheep,</b> which are all brought as burnt offerings, <b>and the goat</b> that is brought as a sin offering, <b>does not prevent</b> the bringing of <b>the</b> two <b>loaves,</b> and they are sacrificed nevertheless. Failure to bring <b>the</b> two <b>loaves does not prevent</b> sacrifice of the accompanying animal offerings. Failure to bring <b>the</b> two <b>loaves prevents</b> sacrifice of <b>the</b> accompanying peace offering of two <b>sheep, but</b> failure to sacrifice <b>the</b> two <b>sheep does not prevent</b> the bringing of <b>the</b> two <b>loaves;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas says: No, rather</b> the opposite is true. Failure to sacrifice <b>the</b> peace offering of two <b>sheep prevents</b> the bringing of <b>the</b> two <b>loaves, but</b> failure to bring <b>the</b> two <b>loaves does not prevent</b> sacrifice of <b>the</b> accompanying peace offering of two <b>sheep. As we found that when the Jewish people were in the wilderness</b> for <b>forty years</b> after the exodus from Egypt, <b>they sacrificed</b> the two <b>sheep</b> as a peace offering on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>without</b> the two <b>loaves,</b> as the two loaves may be brought only from wheat grown in Eretz Yisrael after the Jewish people entered the land. <b>Here too,</b> whenever wheat is unavailable, <b>they</b> should <b>sacrifice</b> the two <b>sheep</b> without the two <b>loaves.</b> However, the two loaves are not sacrificed without the peace offering of two sheep. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Nannas</b> that failure to sacrifice the two sheep prevents the bringing of the two loaves but failure to bring the two loaves does not prevent sacrifice of the accompanying peace offering of two sheep, <b>but the reason</b> for that ruling <b>is not in accordance with his statement.</b> <b>As all</b> the offerings that must be sacrificed on <i>Shavuot</i> <b>that</b> are <b>stated in the book of Numbers</b> (see 28:27), i.e., two bulls, one ram, and seven sheep as additional offerings and a goat as a sin offering, were <b>sacrificed</b> when the Jewish people were <b>in the wilderness. But all</b> the offerings <b>stated in Leviticus</b> (see 23:18–20), i.e., the offerings accompanying the two loaves, were <b>not sacrificed</b> when the Jewish people were <b>in the wilderness.</b> Not only were the two loaves not sacrificed, but the accompanying offerings, including the peace offering of the two sheep, were also not sacrificed, because it was only <b>when they arrived in Eretz</b> Yisrael that <b>these</b> additional offerings <b>and those</b> offerings accompanying the two loaves <b>were sacrificed.</b> Neither the additional offerings of <i>Shavuot</i> nor the two loaves, and the offerings that accompany them, were sacrificed in the wilderness, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas. Rather, <b>for what</b> reason <b>do I</b> nevertheless <b>say that the sheep should be sacrificed without</b> the <b>loaves,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the sheep permit themselves,</b> as the sprinkling of their blood and the burning of the portions consumed on the altar renders it permitted to partake of their meat. <b>And</b> why are <b>the loaves not</b> sacrificed <b>without the sheep?</b> It is <b>because there is no</b> item <b>to permit</b> the loaves, as the loaves are permitted only after the sheep are sacrificed.",
            "Failure to sacrifice <b>the daily offerings does not prevent</b> sacrifice of <b>the additional offerings, and</b> likewise, failure to sacrifice <b>the additional offerings does not prevent</b> sacrifice of <b>the daily offerings.

If the priests <b>did not sacrifice a lamb in the morning</b> as the daily offering, nevertheless, <b>they should sacrifice</b> a lamb <b>in the afternoon</b> as the daily offering, as failure to sacrifice one daily offering does not prevent sacrifice of the other. In all of these cases, if they failed to sacrifice one offering, they should still sacrifice the other. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: When</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply?

The meal offering of a sinner does not require them, as it is written: “He shall not put oil upon it, neither shall he give any frankincense upon it; for it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11). With regard to the meal offering brought by a <i>sota</i>, it is similarly written: “He shall pour no oil upon it, nor give frankincense upon it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance” (Numbers 5:15).",

This requirement applies to peace offerings belonging <b>both</b> to <b>men and</b> to <b>women, by</b> male <b>Jews and not by others.</b> The Gemara will explain this seemingly contradictory statement on 61b.

The loaves that accompany the offering that the nazirite brings upon completion of his period of <b>naziriteship would come</b> with only <b>two parts</b> of the three types of <i>matza</i> that accompany the thanks offering, namely, <b>loaves and wafers, but there is no</b> <i>matza</i> <b>poached</b> in water (see Numbers 6:15). <b>Consequently,</b> the loaves of the offering of a nazirite are from <b>ten <i>kav</i></b> of fine flour according to the <b>Jerusalem</b> measure, as taught in the previous mishna that each type of the loaves of <i>matza</i> comes from five <i>kav</i> of flour, <b>which</b> equal <b>six-and-two-thirds tenths</b> of an ephah according to the wilderness measure, as each type of the loaves of <i>matza</i> comes from three-and-one-third tenths of an ephah. <b>From all</b> of the four types of loaves accompanying the thanks offering, <b>one takes one</b> loaf <b>from</b> each set of <b>ten as <i>teruma</i>,</b> to be given to a priest, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall present from it one of each offering as a <i>teruma</i> unto the Lord;</b> to the priest that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings against the altar it shall be given” (Leviticus 7:14). The verse is analyzed: <b>“One”</b> indicates <b>that one should not take a sliced</b> loaf; <b>“of each offering”</b> indicates <b>that all the offerings should be equal,</b> i.e., <b>that one should not take</b> a loaf <b>from</b> one type of <b>offering for another</b> type; <b>“to the priest that sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings against the altar it shall be given,” and the rest</b> of the loaves are <b>eaten by the owner.</b> ",
            " In the case of <b>one who slaughters the thanks offering</b> in its proper place <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> at that time <b>its</b> forty <b>loaves were outside the wall, the loaves were not consecrated.</b> Likewise, <b>if he slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>before the surface</b> of the loaves <b>formed a crust in the oven, and even</b> if the surface of all the loaves <b>formed a crust except for one of them, the loaves were not consecrated.</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering with the intent to partake of it or to burn the sacrificial portions <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> and the offering was rendered <i>piggul</i> or was disqualified, respectively, <b>the loaves were consecrated</b> and either rendered <i>piggul</i> or disqualified. If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>and it was discovered</b> that it was <b>an animal with a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], the loaves were not consecrated,</b> as the cause of the animal’s disqualification preceded its slaughter. If one <b>slaughtered</b> the thanks offering <b>and it was discovered</b> that it is <b>a blemished</b> animal that may not be sacrificed <i>ab initio</i> but if it ascended the altar it may be sacrificed, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He has <b>consecrated</b> the loaves, since if the offering ascends the altar it is sacrificed. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> He has <b>not consecrated</b> the loaves, since it may not be sacrificed <i>ab initio</i>.

            "<b>There are three</b> harvests of <b>olives</b> each year, <b>and in each</b> of <b>them, three</b> different grades of <b>oils</b> are produced.

After the oil ceases to seep from the crushed olives, <b>one then presses down with</b> a wooden <b>beam</b> upon them, causing additional oil to flow from the basket into the vessel. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The excessive pressure produced by pressing down with a beam would cause some of the flesh of the olives to get mixed in with the oil, compromising its quality. Rather, one applies pressure <b>by</b> placing <b>stones</b> upon the olives. <b>This is the second</b> grade of oil. <b>One then ground</b> the olives with a millstone <b>and pressed down</b> with a beam on those olives to extract any remaining oil; <b>this is the third</b> grade of oil. <b>The first</b> grade is fit <b>for</b> kindling <b>the Candelabrum,</b> which requires: “Refined olive oil” (Leviticus 24:2), <b>and the rest</b> are fit <b>for</b> use in <b>meal offerings.</b> How is <b>the second</b> olive harvest processed? <b>One picks</b> the crop of olives that is accessible while one is standing <b>on the rooftop.</b> This was the second lot of olives to ripen. <b>And one crushes</b> it in a mortar <b>and places</b> those olives <b>into</b> a wicker <b>basket,</b> allowing the oil to drip through the holes into a vessel underneath. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One positions the olives on the walls, <b>surrounding the basket.

Accordingly, <b>even</b> if one brings <b>a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, <b>one adds to it sixty <i>log</i></b> of oil. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Each meal offering, irrespective of its volume, <b>even a meal offering of sixty tenths</b> of an ephah of flour, requires <b>only its</b> single <b><i>log</i></b> of oil, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the offering brought by a poor leper on the day of his purification: “And a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil <b>for a meal offering, and a <i>log</i> of oil”</b> (Leviticus 14:21). The juxtaposition of “a meal offering” with “a <i>log</i> of oil” teaches a principle for all meal offerings: Each offering requires only one <i>log</i> of oil. The mishna lists the quantities of oil and wine that were required for the meal offerings and libations that accompanied the sacrifice of an animal. <b>Six</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one<b>-</b>half of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a bull; and four</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-third of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a ram; and three</b> <i>log</i>, i.e., one-quarter of a <i>hin</i>, <b>for</b> those of <b>a lamb.</b> In addition, <b>three and a half</b> <i>log</i> of oil were required <b>for the Candelabrum,</b> as there were seven lamps and <b>a half-<i>log</i></b> was required <b>for each lamp.</b> ",
            "Many animal offerings are brought together with a meal offering and a wine libation. These additions are collectively referred to as libations. <b>One may mix together the libations of bulls with the libations of rams;</b> the meal offerings may be mixed as they both share the same ratio of flour to oil, i.e., two <i>log</i> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour. Likewise, one may mix together <b>the libations of lambs with the libations of</b> other <b>lambs,</b> as the meal offerings both share the same ratio of three <i>log</i> of oil for each tenth of an ephah of flour.

And one may mix together the libations <b>of</b> an offering brought on one <b>day with</b> those <b>of the day before,</b> if the meal offerings have the same ratio of oil to flour. <b>But one may not mix together the libations of lambs with the libations of bulls or</b> the libations of <b>rams,</b> as the meal offerings have different ratios of oil to flour. <b>And</b> nevertheless, <b>if one intermingled</b> the flour and oil of <b>these</b> lamb offerings <b>by themselves and</b> the flour and oil of <b>these</b> bull or ram offerings <b>by themselves, and</b> only then <b>were they mixed together,</b> then they remain <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed. <b>If</b> they were mixed together <b>before</b> the oil and flour of each offering <b>were</b> independently <b>intermingled</b> to form the meal offering, then they are <b>disqualified.</b> With regard to <b>the lamb</b> offering <b>that comes with the <i>omer</i></b> meal offering, which is accompanied by another meal offering and a wine libation, <b>even though</b> the quantity of flour used in <b>its meal offering is doubled,</b> i.e., one uses twice the amount that is generally used for meal offerings that accompany the sacrifice of a lamb, <b>its</b> oil and wine <b>libations were not doubled;</b> rather, three <i>log</i> of oil and three <i>log</i> of wine were used, per the standard quantities used for a lamb.

            "<b>All measuring vessels that were in the Temple were</b> such that they held the volume that they measured when their contents were <b>heaped</b> above the rim, <b>except for</b> the measuring vessel used to measure the flour for the griddle-cake offering <b>of the High Priest, as its heaped</b> measure, i.e., the quantity of flour held by a tenth of an ephah measuring vessel when heaped, <b>was contained within its</b> walls when the flour was leveled with the rim. This was due to the fact that the measuring vessel for the griddle-cake offering was slightly larger than the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel. With regard to <b>measuring vessels for liquids, their overflows,</b> i.e., that which flows onto the outside of vessel’s walls, <b>are sacred, but</b> with regard to <b>measuring vessels for dry</b> substances, <b>their overflows are non-sacred.</b> <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the reason for this difference is that since the <b>measuring vessels for liquids</b> are themselves <b>sacred, therefore their overflows are sacred,</b> and since the <b>measuring vessels for dry</b> substances are <b>non-sacred, therefore their overflows are non-sacred.

The publicity was to underscore that the sixteenth of Nisan was the proper time for the <i>omer</i> harvest.",
            "After <b>they harvested</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>and placed it in</b> the <b>baskets, they brought it to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. And they would singe in</b> the <b>fire</b> the kernels of barley while they were still on the stalks, <b>in order to fulfill the mitzva of parched</b> grain, as it is written: “And if you bring a meal offering of first fruits to the Lord, you shall bring for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire” (Leviticus 2:14). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Prior to parching the kernels, they would remove them from the stalks by <b>beating</b> them <b>with</b> soft, moist <b>reeds and with cabbage stalks,</b> not with sticks, <b>so that</b> the kernels <b>would not be crushed.</b> <b>They</b> then <b>placed</b> the grain <b>into a hollow vessel [<i>le’abuv</i>], and</b> this <b>vessel was perforated so that the fire would take hold of</b> the grain <b>in its entirety.</b> After parching the kernels, <b>they</b> would <b>spread</b> the kernels <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard and the wind would blow upon</b> the kernels, cooling and drying them. <b>They</b> then <b>placed</b> the kernels <b>in a mill</b> used <b>to</b> grind <b>grits,</b> so that the barley would not be ground so fine that the shell would be mixed with the grain. <b>And they produced from</b> the ground barley <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah of barley flour <b>that was sifted through thirteen sifters, and the rest is redeemed and</b> may be <b>eaten by any person.

            "<b>Once the <i>omer</i> was sacrificed</b> people would <b>emerge and find the marketplace of Jerusalem full of the flour</b> from the <b>parched grain</b> of the new crop that was permitted by the waving and the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering. That filling of the marketplace with the new crop was performed <b>not with the approval of the Sages;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.

From</b> the time <b>that the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i>, the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>is entirely prohibited,</b> i.e., one may partake of the new crop only the next day. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: But isn’t it forbidden by Torah law, as it is stated:</b> “And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh grain, <b>until this selfsame day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14)? This means that the new crop is prohibited on the day of the waving unless permitted by sacrifice of the offering. <b>And</b> if so, <b>for what</b> reason is it <b>permitted</b> for those <b>distant</b> to eat the new crop <b>from midday and beyond,</b> when the Temple is standing? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they know that the</b> members of the <b>court are not indolent in its</b> sacrifice, and certainly by midday the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering has been completed.",
            "Sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>would permit</b> consumption of the new crop <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country</b> outside the Temple, <b>and the two loaves</b> offering would permit the sacrifice of the new crop <b>in the Temple.

",
            "Even before the <i>omer</i> offering is brought, <b>one may reap</b> a crop that grows in <b>an irrigated field in the valleys, but one may not arrange</b> the reaped stalks in <b>a pile.

One may</b> reap crops in any field <b>for fodder</b> and <b>feed it to an animal. Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> may one do so? <b>At a time when he begins</b> reaping <b>before</b> the crop reaches <b>one-third</b> of its potential growth. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One may reap and feed</b> the crops to animals <b>even after they reached one-third</b> of their potential growth.

            "<b>And one may reap</b> crops prior to the <i>omer</i> <b>due to</b> potential damage to <b>saplings</b> growing alongside the crops; and <b>due to the place of mourning,</b> i.e., to create room for those consoling mourners, who would bless them upon their return from the cemetery; and <b>due to</b> the need to create room for students to study, as failure to do so would lead to <b>dereliction of</b> Torah study in <b>the study hall.</b> After reaping the crops for any of these reasons, <b>one may not fashion them</b> into <b>sheaves, but he leaves them unbound.</b> <b>The mitzva of the <i>omer</i></b> is for the barley <b>to come from standing grain.</b> If <b>one did not find</b> standing grain, <b>he brings from sheaves.

If <b>one did not find</b> moist grain, <b>he brings from dry</b> grain. <b>Its mitzva is</b> for one <b>to reap</b> the grain <b>at night,</b> but if <b>it was reaped during the day,</b> it is <b>fit.

With regard to the loaves of <b>shewbread, their length is ten handbreadths, their width is five handbreadths, and</b> each loaf’s hornlike <b>protrusions</b> is <b>seven fingerbreadths</b> high. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The following letters are a mnemonic so <b>that you will not err</b> and forget the dimensions of the two loaves: <b><i>Zayin</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>dalet</i>.</b> The numerical value of the letter <i>zayin</i> is seven and the numerical value of the letter <i>dalet</i> is four. The mnemonic therefore represents the length of seven handbreadths, the width of four handbreadths, and the height of four fingerbreadths, respectively. The following letters are a mnemonic for the dimensions of the shewbread: <b><i>Yod</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>zayin</i>,</b> which stand for the length of ten handbreadths, the width of five handbreadths, and the height of seven fingerbreadths, respectively. <b>Ben Zoma says</b> that it is written: <b>“And you shall set upon the Table shewbread [<i>leḥem panim</i>] before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30).

            "As for <b>the Table, its length is ten</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is five</b> handbreadths, as the Torah states that the Table is two cubits long and one cubit wide (see Exodus 25:23), and Rabbi Yehuda holds that the cubit used as the unit of measurement for the construction of the Temple vessels was equal to five handbreadths. With regard to <b>the shewbread, its length is ten</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is five</b> handbreadths. The priest <b>places the length</b> of the two shewbread arrangements <b>across the width of</b> the <b>Table,</b> which leaves five handbreadths of each loaf protruding from the Table. <b>And he folds</b> the protruding <b>two and a half handbreadths</b> upward <b>on this</b> side of the Table, <b>and</b> the protruding <b>two and a half handbreadths</b> upward <b>on that</b> side of the Table. One <b>finds,</b> therefore, that <b>the length</b> of the shewbread <b>covers the width of the Table.</b> Similarly, since the width of each loaf is five handbreadths, the width of the two loaves filled the entire length of the Table. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>the Table, its length is twelve</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is six</b> handbreadths, as the measure of a cubit used in the construction of the Temple vessels was equal to six handbreadths. Concerning <b>the shewbread, its length is ten</b> handbreadths <b>and its width is five</b> handbreadths. Rabbi Meir continues: The priest <b>places the length</b> of the shewbread <b>across the width of</b> the <b>Table,</b> which leaves four handbreadths of each loaf protruding from the Table. <b>He folds</b> the protruding <b>two handbreadths</b> upward <b>on this</b> side of the Table, <b>and</b> the protruding <b>two handbreadths</b> upward <b>on that</b> side of the Table. The width of the two arrangements of shewbread occupies only ten of the twelve handbreadths of the length of the Table, <b>and</b> this leaves <b>a space of two handbreadths in the middle,</b> between the two arrangements, <b>so that the wind will blow between them</b> and prevent the loaves from becoming moldy. <b>Abba Shaul says: There,</b> in the space between the two arrangements, the priests <b>would place</b> the <b>two bowls of frankincense that</b> accompany <b>the shewbread.</b> The Sages <b>said to him: But isn’t it already stated: “And you shall place pure frankincense upon [<i>al</i>] each arrangement,</b> that it may be for the bread as a memorial part, an offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 24:7)? The verse indicates that the frankincense is placed upon the shewbread and not next to it. Abba Shaul <b>said to</b> the Sages in response: <b>Isn’t it already stated: “And next to him [<i>alav</i>] shall be the tribe of Manasseh”</b> (Numbers 2:20)? Just as the preposition “<i>alav</i>” in this verse means that the tribe of Manasseh pitched camp next to the tribe of Ephraim and not upon it, so too, the preposition “<i>al</i>” means that the frankincense was placed next to the arrangements of the shewbread.",
            "The mishna continues to describe the shewbread Table: <b>And there were four panels of gold there,</b> which stood on the ground and rose above the height of the Table, and <b>they split up at their upper ends,</b> above the Table, so <b>that</b> the rods upon which the shewbread was placed could rest upon the panels. In this manner the panels <b>would support</b> the shewbread. There were <b>two</b> panels <b>for this arrangement and two</b> panels <b>for that arrangement, and</b> there were <b>twenty-eight rods,</b> each of which was shaped <b>like half of a hollow reed.</b> There were <b>fourteen</b> rods <b>for this arrangement and fourteen</b> rods <b>for that arrangement.</b> <b>Neither</b> the <b>arranging of</b> the <b>rods</b> for the new shewbread, <b>nor their removal</b> from the arrangement of the old shewbread, <b>overrides Shabbat. Rather,</b> a priest <b>enters</b> the Sanctuary <b>on Shabbat eve,</b> i.e., Friday before sundown, <b>and removes</b> each of the rods from between the loaves. <b>And</b> according to Rabbi Meir he then <b>places</b> each rod in the space between the two arrangements, <b>along the length of the Table.</b> Then, on Shabbat, he places the new shewbread on the Table without the rods, and he inserts the rods between the loaves at the conclusion of Shabbat. The mishna concludes: <b>All the vessels that were in the Temple,</b> including the Table, were placed so that <b>their length was</b> from east to west, <b>along the length of</b> the <b>Temple.</b>",
            "<b>There were two tables in the Entrance Hall, on the inside</b> of the Entrance Hall, next <b>to the entrance to the Temple,</b> i.e., next to the entrance to the Sanctuary. <b>One</b> was <b>of marble and one</b> was <b>of gold. On</b> the table <b>of marble,</b> the priests <b>place the</b> new <b>shewbread</b> that has been baked, <b>before its entrance</b> into the Sanctuary, so that the loaves may cool a little from the heat of the oven and not spoil. <b>And</b> when the old shewbread is removed from the shewbread Table it is placed <b>on</b> the table <b>of gold upon its exit</b> from the Sanctuary, where it remains until the frankincense is burned on the altar. The reason the shewbread is placed on a gold table when it is removed, rather than on a marble or silver table, is <b>that one elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and one does not downgrade.</b> Since it is set on the gold shewbread Table all week, it cannot be downgraded to a marble or silver table upon its removal. <b>And</b> there was <b>one</b> Table <b>of gold within</b> the Sanctuary, <b>upon which the shewbread</b> is <b>always</b> found. The mishna describes the manner in which it is ensured that the shewbread is constantly on the Table: <b>And four priests enter, two</b> with the <b>two arrangements</b> of the new shewbread <b>in their hands and two</b> with the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense <b>in their hands. And four</b> priests <b>precede</b> them, entering the Sanctuary <b>before them, two to take</b> the <b>two arrangements</b> of the old shewbread from the Table, <b>and two to take</b> the <b>two bowls</b> of frankincense. <b>Those bringing</b> the new shewbread <b>into</b> the Sanctuary <b>stand in the north and their faces are to the south, and those removing</b> the old shewbread <b>stand in the south and their faces are to the north. These</b> priests <b>draw</b> the old shewbread from the Table <b>and those</b> priests <b>place</b> the new shewbread on the Table, <b>and for</b> each <b>handbreadth of this</b> old shewbread that is removed from the Table a <b>handbreadth of that</b> new shewbread is placed upon the Table, so that the Table is never without loaves upon it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall set upon the Table shewbread <b>before Me always”</b> (Exodus 25:30). <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> if <b>these</b> priests were to <b>remove</b> the shewbread from the Table entirely, <b>and</b> only afterward <b>those</b> priests were to <b>place</b> the new shewbread upon the Table, this <b>too would</b> fulfill the requirement that the shewbread <b>always</b> be on the Table. It is unnecessary to ensure the uninterrupted presence of the shewbread upon the Table, as long as it does not remain a single night without shewbread upon it. The mishna describes the manner in which the shewbread is distributed: The priests who carried the old shewbread loaves <b>came out</b> of the Sanctuary <b>and placed them on the table of gold that was in the Entrance Hall.</b> The priests then <b>burned</b> on the altar <b>the</b> frankincense that was in the <b>bowls. And the loaves were</b> subsequently <b>distributed to the priests.</b> This occurred on Shabbat, the day that the priestly watch that served in the Temple during the preceding week was replaced by the priestly watch that would serve during the following week. The shewbread was distributed to the priests of both watches. If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat, the loaves are distributed at night,</b> at the conclusion of the fast, since they may not be eaten during the day. If Yom Kippur <b>occurs on Friday,</b> i.e., when the holy day begins on Thursday evening, <b>the goat</b> sin offering <b>of Yom Kippur is eaten</b> by the priests <b>at night,</b> i.e., on Friday night, as it may be eaten only on the day that it is sacrificed or during the following night, until midnight. <b>And</b> since there is no possibility of cooking the meat, as one may not cook on Yom Kippur or Shabbat, <b>the Babylonians,</b> i.e., priests who had emigrated from Babylonia, <b>eat it when it is raw, due to</b> the fact <b>that they are broad-minded</b> with regard to their food, i.e., they are not particular and will eat meat even when it is not cooked.",
            "If one <b>arranged the bread</b> on the Table <b>on Shabbat but</b> arranged <b>the bowls</b> of frankincense only <b>after Shabbat,</b> then if he subsequently <b>burned</b> the frankincense placed in <b>the bowls on the</b> following <b>Shabbat,</b> the loaves are <b>unfit</b> for consumption, since the frankincense had not been on the Table for the entire week. Since the burning of the frankincense did not render the loaves permitted for consumption, <b>one is not</b> ever <b>liable for</b> eating <b>them due to</b> violation of the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i></b> or <b><i>notar</i>, or</b> for partaking of the shewbread when one is <b>ritually impure.</b> One violates these prohibitions only if the frankincense is burned in a manner that permits consumption of the shewbread. If one <b>arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense <b>on Shabbat but</b> then <b>burned</b> the frankincense that was in <b>the bowls after the</b> following <b>Shabbat,</b> that burning of the frankincense is <b>not valid</b> and the shewbread is unfit for consumption. <b>And</b> since the frankincense was not burned in a manner that permits consumption of the shewbread, <b>one is not</b> ever <b>liable for</b> eating <b>them due to</b> violation of the prohibitions of <b><i>piggul</i></b> or <b><i>notar</i>, or</b> for partaking of the shewbread when one is <b>ritually impure.</b> If <b>one arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense <b>after Shabbat and burned</b> the frankincense that was in <b>the bowls on the</b> subsequent <b>Shabbat,</b> the burning of the frankincense is <b>not valid</b> and the shewbread is unfit for consumption. <b>How should</b> one <b>act</b> to prevent the shewbread from being rendered unfit?

If he says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>sixty-one</b> tenths of an ephah, <b>he brings sixty</b> tenths <b>in one vessel and one</b> tenth <b>in another vessel, as</b> the greatest number of tenths of an ephah that <b>the community brings</b> as meal offerings in one day is <b>on the first festival day of <i>Sukkot</i> when</b> it <b>occurs on Shabbat,</b> when <b>sixty-one</b> tenths of an ephah of fine flour are brought.

Three tenths of an ephah are brought for each bull, two tenths for each goat, and a tenth for each lamb. Altogether, that is sixty-one tenths of an ephah. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> What is the relevance of the tenths of an ephah sacrificed on <i>Sukkot</i> that occurs on Shabbat? <b>Aren’t these</b> meal offerings <b>for bulls and those for lambs, and they are not mixed with each other</b> (see 89a)? <b>Rather,</b> the reason that one may not bring more than sixty tenths of an ephah in one vessel is because <b>up to sixty</b> tenths of fine flour can <b>be mixed</b> with one <i>log</i> of oil. The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Is it so that <b>sixty</b> tenths of flour <b>can be mixed</b> with a <i>log</i> of oil, <b>but sixty-one</b> tenths <b>cannot be mixed?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: All the measures of the Sages</b> are <b>so:</b> For example, <b>in</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>one immerses</b> for purification, <b>and in</b> a ritual bath with <b>forty <i>se’a</i> less</b> the small measure of <b>a <i>kortov</i>, one cannot immerse in it</b> for purification. <b>One does not pledge</b> a libation of one <b><i>log</i>, two</b> <i>log</i>, <b>or five</b> <i>log</i> of wine, because there are no existing libations with those measures of wine. <b>But one pledges</b> a libation of <b>three</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a lamb, <b>or four</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a ram, <b>or six</b> <i>log</i>, which is the measure of wine brought with a bull. <b>And</b> one may pledge a libation of <b>six</b> <i>log</i> <b>and beyond,</b> as any greater amount can be composed of combinations of these three.

            "<b>One may pledge</b> to bring independent libations of <b>wine, but one may not pledge oil</b> alone; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Tarfon says: One may pledge oil</b> as well. <b>Rabbi Tarfon said: Just as we found that wine comes</b> as <b>an obligation and comes</b> as <b>a gift offering</b> independent of any offering, <b>so too,</b> we find <b>that oil comes</b> as <b>an obligation and comes</b> as <b>a gift</b> offering. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: No, if you said</b> that this is true <b>with regard to wine, as</b> it is <b>sacrificed with its obligatory</b> offering <b>by itself, shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is also the case <b>with regard to oil, which is never sacrificed with its obligatory</b> offering <b>by itself but only</b> mixed with the flour? The mishna concludes with a ruling concerning a voluntary meal offering: <b>Two</b> people <b>do not pledge</b> a meal offering of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah as partners, <b>but they may pledge a burnt offering and a peace offering.
