If he took the handful with his left [hand], it [the offering] is invalid. Ben Betera says: he should return it and take the handful again with his right. If he took the handful, and a stone or a chunk of salt or a remnant of frankincense came with it in his hand, it is invalid, because they said: one who takes too much or too little [as] the handful, it is invalid.

But the sages say, both are rejected due to piggul and he is liable for extirpation for both of them.

But the libations cannot render the animal-offering rejected due to piggul.  One who slaughters an animal-offering intending to eat part of it on the next day, both it and the libations are rejected due to piggul; if he intended to offer the libations the next day, the libations are rejected due to piggul but the animal-offering is not.

The sages agree with Rabbi Meir with regard to a sinner’s grain offering or a grain offering of jealousy, that if he had an intention which renders something rejected due to piggul during the [burning of the] handful, [the remainder] is rejected due to piggul and he is liable for extirpation for it, since the handful is the entire thing that causes it to be permitted.  If he slaughtered one of the lambs intending to eat the two loaves the next day, or if he burned one of the dishes of frankincense intending to eat the two rows [of the shewbread] on the next day:  Rabbi Meir says: it is rejected due to piggul and he is liable for extirpation for it;  But the sages say: it is not rejected due to piggul, unless he had an intention that renders something rejected due to piggul during the service of the whole of the thing that causes it to be permitted.

If the handful of one grain offering was mixed with the handful of another, or with a priest’s grain offering, or with the grain offering of the anointed [high] priest, or with the grain offering [offered with] the libations, it is valid.   Rabbi Judah says: if [it was mixed] with the grain offering of the anointed [high] priest or with the grain offering [offered with] libations, it is invalid, for since the consistency of the one is thick and the consistency of the other is thin, each absorbs from the other.

If he did burn it, then the grain offering from which the handful had been taken fulfills the owner's obligation while the other from which the handful had not been taken does not fulfill the owner's obligation.  If the handful was mixed with the remainder of the grain offering or with the remainder of another grain offering, it must not be burned;  If he did burn it does fulfill the owner's obligation. If the handful had become unclean and yet he offered it, the forehead plate [worn by the High Priest] renders it acceptable,   But if it went out [of the Temple Court] and  afterwards he offered it, the forehead plate does not render it acceptable. For the forehead plate renders acceptable only an offering which was unclean but not that which was taken out. ",

Simon said: The law is [according to] the words of Ben Nanos, but the grounds are not [according to] his words, [because] all the [offerings] stated in Numbers were offered in wilderness, but all the [offerings] stated in Leviticus were not offered in the wilderness. When they came to the land, they offered both [sets of offerings]. And why do I say [nevertheless] they offer the lambs without the bread-offering? Because the lambs render themselves permissible without the bread-offering [via the burning of their innards on the altar], but the bread-offering without the lambs - there is nothing [offered] that would permit it.",

Even if they did not offer the lamb in the morning, they must offer it towards evening. Rabbi Shimon said: When is this so? Only when they had acted under duress or in error, but if they acted deliberately and did not offer the lamb in the morning they may not offer it towards evening.  If they did not burn the incense in the morning, they burn it towards evening.   Rabbi Shimon said: all of it was burned towards evening [in such a case] - for the golden altar is dedicated only by the incense of spices, and the altar for the whole burnt offering [is dedicated only] by the daily offering of the morning, and the table [is dedicated only] by the showbread on Shabbat, and the menorah [is dedicated] only by [the kindling of] seven lamps towards evening.",

If a [high] priest offered half in the morning and then died and they appointed another priest in his place, [the successor] may not bring a half-tenth from his house, neither [may he use] the remaining half-tenth of the first [high priest]. Rather, he must bring a whole tenth and divide it, and offer one half and leaving the other half goes to waste.  It turns out that two halves are offered and two halves go to waste.

He should leave it to the following Shabbat because even if it is on the table for many days, there is nothing wrong.",
            "The Two Loaves were eaten on no less than the second day [from their baking] and no greater than the third day. How so, they were baked on the day before Yom Tov [Shavuot] and eaten on Yom Tov which is the second day. If Yom Tov fell after Shabbat, then they were eaten on the third day. The Panim bread were eaten no less than nine days [after their baking] and no greater than eleven. How so, they were baked on Friday and eaten the following Shabbat, which is nine days. If Yom Tov fell on Friday then they would be eaten on the tenth day. If the two days of the New Year fell before Shabbat then they were eaten on the eleventh day. And they do not override Shabbat or Yom Tov. Raban Shimon Ben Gamliel said in the name of Rabbi Shimmon son of the Deputy High-Priest, they do override Yom Tov but not the Fast Day [Yom Kippur]."

            "The grain offerings and libations that became impure before they became sanctified in a vessel, they can be redeemed.  Once they have become sanctified in a vessel, they can no longer be redeemed.  Birds, wood, frankincense and temple vessels cannot be redeemed because redemption was only stated regarding beasts [cattle, sheep and goats].  ",

[If he committed] to bring this [grain offering prepared] in a frying pan but he brought [one prepared] in a deep-frying pan or to bring this [grain offering prepared] in a deep-frying pan but he brought [one prepared] in a frying pan, it is invalid.  If he said I will bring two <i>esronim</i> [specific dry volume measure] [of flour] in one vessel, but he brought it in two vessels or he said in two vessels but he brought in one, what he brought, he brought, but he did not fulfill his obligation.

If he said I will bring two <i>esronim</i> in one vessel and he brought them in two vessels, and they said [to him] \"you vowed regarding one vessel\", if he [subsequently]brought it in one vessel, it is valid; in two vessels it is invalid.  If he said I will bring two <i>esronim</i> in two vessels and he brought them in one vessel and they they said [to him] \"you vowed regarding two vessels\", if he [subsequently]brought it in two vessels, it is valid; in one vessel it is as if two grain offerings became mixed.

If he said, \"I will bring one of 61 <i>issaron</i>\", he may bring 60 in one vessel and one in another vessel: since the community brings 61 <i>issaron</i> on the first day of Sukkot that falls on Shabbat , it is enough that the individual should be less than then congregation by one.  Rabbi Shimon says: but some of these [Sukkot grain offerings] are for the bulls and others for the sheep and they cannot be mixed with one another! Rather, [the reason for the limitation is that] until 60, they can be mixed well.  They said to him: 60 can be mixed but 61 cannot?  He said to them: all of the measurements of the Sages are this way: In forty <i>se'ah</i> [a specific liquid volume measure] one immerses; in 40 <i>se'ah</i> minus a <i>kortov</i> [a minute volume measure] one may not immerse.  One may not vow one, two or five <i>log</i> [of wine for libations],  but one may vow three, four, six, or more than six. ",
            "One may vow wine [alone], but not oil [alone], [these are] the words of Rabbi Akiva; Rabbi Tarfon says: one may vow oil.  Rabbi Tarfon said: just as we see regarding wine that it comes both as an obligation and as a free-will vow, so too oil comes as an obligation and as a free-will vow.  Rabbi Akiva said to him, not so! If you say regarding wine, which is brought as an obligation on its own, can you say the same thing regarding oil which is not brought as an obligation on its own?  Two people may not vow one <i>issaron</i> but they may vow an <i>olah</i> [an offering burnt entirely upon the altar] or a <i>shelamim</i> [an offering whose various parts are consumed by its owners, the Kohanim and the fire on the altar], and regarding birds - even one bird.
