            "All offerings which are not offered for their own sake are valid, but they have not fulfilled the obligations of [their] owners.  [This is true] except for the Passover offering and the  <i>Chattat</i> [an offering brought to expiate sin]. The Passover offering [is invalid if not slaughtered for its own sake] at its appropriate time, and the <i>Chattat</i> [is invalid if not slaughtered for its own sake] at any time.  Rabbi Eliezer says: Even the <i>Asham</i> [an offering brought to alleviate guilt]. The Passover offering [is invalid if not slaughtered for its own sake] at its appropriate time, and the <i>Chattat</i> and the <i>Asham</i> [are invalid if not slaughtered for their own sake] at any time.  Rabbi Eliezer said: The <i>Chattat</i> comes [to atone] for sin and the <i>Asham</i> comes [to atone] for sin.  Just as the <i>Chattat</i> that is not [offered] for its own sake is invalid, so too the <i>Asham</i> that is not [offered] for its own sake is invalid.",
            "Yose ben Choni says: Those [animals] which are slaughtered for the sake of a Passover offering and for the sake of a <i>Chattat</i> are invalid. Shimon Achi Azariah says: if they were slaughtered for the sake of a higher-level offering they are valid; for the sake of a lower-level offering they are invalid. How so? <i>Kodshai Kodashim</i> [sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity.  They may be slaughtered only on the north-west corner of the altar, and consumed only within the Temple compound by male priests, or burnt entirely] that were slaughtered for the sake of <i>Kodashim Kalim</i> [sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity.  They may be slaughtered anywhere in the Temple courtyard and consumed by most anyone, anywhere in Jerusalem] are invalid. <i>Kodashim Kalim</i> that were slaughtered for the sake of <i>Kodshai Kodashim </i> are valid.  The <i>Bechor</i> [first-born offering] or a <i>Ma'aser</i> [animal tithe] that were slaughtered for the sake of a <i>Shelamim</i> [an offering whose various parts are consumed by its owners, the Kohanim and the fire on the altar] are valid. And <i>Shelamim</i> that were slaughtered for the sake of a <i>Bechor</i> or for the sake of <i>Ma'aser</i> are invalid.",
            "[If] a Passover offering was slaughtered in the morning of the fourteenth [of Nisan, but not for its own sake, Rabbi Yehoshua deems it valid, as if it had been slaughtered on the thirteenth [of Nisan]. Ben Beteira invalidates it, as if it had been slaughtered in the afternoon. Shimon ben Azzai said: I received a tradition from the mouths of seventy-two elders on the day they appointed Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah as [head of the] academy, that all offerings that are eaten which were not slaughtered for their own sake are valid, but they have not fulfilled the obligations of [their] owners. [This is true] except for the Passover offering and the <i>Chattat</i>. And Ben Azzai did not add [to this tradition] except [to include] the burnt-offering, but the sages did not agree with him.",
            "[If] the Passover offering and the <i>Chattat</i> were not slaughtered for their own sake, [or if the priest] did not collect [the blood from these sacrifices] for its own sake, or did not carry [the blood to the altar] for its own sake, or did not sprinkle [the blood] for its own sake; or [if he performed these acts both] for their own sake and not for their own sake; or [both] not for their own sake and for their own sake - they are invalid. How can it be both for their own sake and not for their own sake? [The priest acted] for the sake of a Passover offering and for the sake a <i>Shelamim</i>. [A priest acting] not for its own sake and for its own sake [would be if he acted] for the sake of a <i>Chattat</i> and for the sake of a Passover offering. For an offering can be invalidated through four things: through slaughtering, and through collecting [the blood], and through carrying [the blood to the altar], and through dashing [the blood on the altar]. Rabbi Shimon validates carrying [regardless of intent], for Rabbi Shimon used to say: It is impossible [to offer a sacrifice] without slaughtering, and without collecting [the blood], and without dashing [the blood], but it is possible [to offer a sacrifice] without carrying [blood] - one slaughters at the side of the altar and dashes [it from where he stands]. Rabbi Eliezer says: [If] one carries [blood] in a case where he needs to carry it, [improper] thought invalidates [the offering]; [if] he carries it in a case where he does not need to carry, [improper] thought does not invalidate [the offering]."

Beit Hillel say: Even a <i>Chattat</i> that had just one application atones.  Therefore, if one sprinkled the first [application] properly, but the second one after its time - it atones. If the first [application] was sprinkled after its time, and the second [application was done] outside its place, it is <i>Piggul</i> [a sacrifice that becomes unfit due to the intention of the officiating priest, while offering it, to consume it outside its permitted time] and it subjects him to <i>Karet</i>[excision at the hands of Heaven].

And [with regard to] the <i>Chattat</i> and the <i>Asham</i>, [these are also brought] for the sake of the sin [for which they atone].

Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: No, you refer to a <i>Chattat</i> which was [performed] for the sake of an <i>Olah</i> [and is subject to <i>Me'ilah</i>] because he changed its objective to something which is subject to <i>Me'ilah</i>; will you say [the same] for an <i>Olah</i> where he changed his objective to a <i>Chattat</i> [considering] he has changed the objective to something not subject to <i>Me'ilah</i>?

They may be slaughtered anywhere in the Temple courtyard and consumed by most anyone, anywhere in Jerusalem] - these prove the point, because he changed their objective to something that is not subject to <i>Me'ilah</i> and yet one is subject to <i>Me'ilah</i> over them. Thus you should not be surprised [with regard to] a <i>Chattat</i> [where] even though one has changed its objective to something that does not make one subject to <i>Me'ilah</i>, one can still be subject to <i>Me'ilah</i> [over it].  Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: No, you refer to <i>Kodshai Kodashim</i> that were slaughtered on the south [side of the altar] and were slaughtered for the sake of <i>Kodashim Kalim</i>, and that he changed their objective to something that comprises both forbidden and permitted things; would you say the same thing regarding a <i>Olah</i> whose objective was changed to something that is entirely permitted?",

Rabbi Yehudah says: It does render a person impure through swallowing.  Said Rabbi Meir: If the slaughtering of an animal [which if it were a] <i>Nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] would transmit impurity via touch and carrying, [nevertheless] loses its ability to transmit impurity [if it were a] <i>Terefah</i>, then a bird [which if it were a] <i>Nevelah</i> would not transmit impurity through touch or carrying, should certainly [cause] a <i>Terefah</i>, if slaughtered, to lose its ability to transmit impurity. Just like we find that slaughtering [a bird] permits it to be eaten, and removes the ability of a <i>Terefah</i> to transmit impurity, so too piercing [a bird's neck] permits it to be eaten [should] remove the ability of a <i>Terefah</i> to transmit impurity. Rabbi Yose says: It is sufficient [to compare a <i>Terefah</i> bird] to a <i>neveilah</i> animal [such that] slaughtering removes its ability to transmit impurity, but piercing [its neck] does not. "
