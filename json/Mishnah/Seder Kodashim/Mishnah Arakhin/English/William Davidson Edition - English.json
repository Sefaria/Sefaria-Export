            "The halakhic status of a house in <b>a city whose</b> houses are attached and their <b>rooftops</b> constitute the top of <b>its wall, and</b> likewise, the status of a house in a city <b>that is not surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun,</b> even if a surrounding wall was constructed during a later period, <b>is not like</b> that <b>of the houses of walled cities. And these are the houses of walled cities:</b> Any city in which there are at least <b>three courtyards,</b> each containing <b>two houses,</b> and which is <b>surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun, e.g., the ancient fort [<i>katzra</i>] of Tzippori, and the fortress [<i>ḥakra</i>] of Gush Ḥalav, and ancient Yodfat, and Gamla, and Gedod, and Ḥadid, and Ono, and Jerusalem, and likewise</b> other <b>similar</b> cities.",
            "With regard to the <b>houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards</b> mentioned in the Torah (see Leviticus 25:31), i.e., houses in villages that are not surrounded by walls, <b>one accords them the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to houses of walled cities and the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to fields.</b> Therefore, <b>they are redeemed immediately and</b> for <b>the entire twelve months</b> following the sale, <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> sale of <b>houses</b> of walled cities, and not like fields, which may be redeemed only after two years. <b>And they leave</b> the possession of the buyer <b>during the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with</b> a per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price, <b>like the</b> sale of <b>fields.</b> By contrast, houses of walled cities become the possession of the buyer in perpetuity after one year, and if they are redeemed within the year, one pays the full sale price. <b>And these are the houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards</b> whose <i>halakha</i> was taught in the previous mishna: Any city in which there are <b>two courtyards</b> each containing <b>two houses, although it is surrounded by a wall from the era of Joshua, son of Nun, their</b> halakhic status <b>is like that of the houses of</b> the unwalled <b>courtyards.</b>",
            "<b>An Israelite who inherited</b> a house in a walled city from <b>his mother’s father</b> who was <b>a Levite does not redeem</b> the house <b>in accordance with this procedure</b> delineated in the previous <i>mishnayot</i>; rather, if he sold the inherited house, he may redeem it always, like a Levite. <b>And likewise, a Levite who inherited</b> a house in a walled city from <b>his mother’s father</b> who was <b>an Israelite does not redeem</b> the house <b>in accordance with this procedure</b> delineated in the previous <i>mishnayot</i>. The mishna provides the source for these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>As it is stated:</b> “And if a man purchases from the Levites, the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out during the Jubilee Year; <b>as the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession</b> among the children of Israel” (Leviticus 25:33). The verse indicates that the ability to always redeem the house of a Levite does not apply <b>unless</b> the one selling the house <b>will be a Levite and</b> the house is located in <b>the cities of the Levites.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: These matters are stated only</b> with regard to a house <b>in the cities of the Levites,</b> even if the owner was not a Levite. The Levites received two thousand cubits surrounding their cities, one thousand cubits of empty lots and one thousand cubits for fields and vineyards. <b>One may neither render a field</b> an empty <b>lot nor</b> an empty <b>lot a field.</b> Similarly, one may neither incorporate an empty <b>lot</b> into <b>a city nor</b> render part of <b>a city</b> an empty <b>lot.</b> <b>Rabbi Elazar said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It applies <b>in the cities of the Levites. But in the cities of the Israelites one may render a field</b> an empty <b>lot but not</b> an empty <b>lot a field,</b> and one may incorporate an empty <b>lot</b> into <b>a city but not</b> render part of <b>a city</b> an empty <b>lot,</b> in order to ensure <b>that they will not</b> thereby <b>destroy the cities of Israel. The priests and the Levites may sell</b> their fields and houses <b>always and may redeem</b> them <b>always, as it is stated: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption”</b> (Leviticus 25:32). Priests are also members of the tribe of Levi."
