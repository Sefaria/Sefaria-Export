But all who slaughter while others are watching them: their slaughter is valid. The slaughter of a non-Jew is a <i>nevelah</i> [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species] and renders impure through carrying. One who slaughters at night, and so too a blind person who slaughters, his slaughter is valid. One who slaughters on Shabbat, or on Yom Kippur, even though he is liable for death, his slaughter is valid.",

All [may] slaughter, they may slaughter at any time, and they may slaughter with anything, except a reaping sickle, a saw, teeth, or a finger nail, because they strangle. One who slaughters with a reaping sickle along the direction [of the teeth], Beit Shammai invalidates, but Beit Hillel validated. If its teeth were smoothed, it is like a knife.",

One who slaughters from the throat, his slaughter is valid. One who performs <i>melikah</i> from the throat, his <i>melikah</i> is invalid, for the entire back of the neck is valid for <i>melikah</i>, and the entire throat is valid for slaughtering.

The majority of one [of the trachea or esophagus] is like [all of] it. Rabbi Yehuda says, \"[Not] until he cuts the jugular veins.\" [If he cut] one half of one for a bird, and one and a half for cattle, his slaughter is unfit.

[If] one was slaughtering and cut off two heads in one blow, if the knife has a neck's width [outside of the cut necks], it is valid. What case is being discussed? At a time when one extends [the knife] but does not bring it back [down the throat], or one brings it back but does not extend. But, if one extended and brought it back, any amount [of knife], even with a surgeon's knife, it is valid. A knife that falls and slaughters, even if it slaughtered in its [proper] manner, [the slaughter] is invalid. For it is said \"Then you shall slaughter and then you shall eat,\" (Deuteronomy 27:7). That which you slaughter, you eat. If the knife fell and he picked it up; or his clothes fell and he picked them up; or he sharpened the knife and became weary; and then his fellow came and slaughtered: if he delayed the amount of time it takes to slaughter, [the slaughter] is invalid. Rabbi Shimon said, \"If he delayed the amount of time it takes to investigate [the knife].\"",

A general principle said by Rabbi Yishbav in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: “Anything invalidated in its slaughtering is a <i>nevelah</i>; anything where its slaughtering is proper but another issue caused it to become invalid is a <i>terefah</i>.” Then Rabbi Akiva agreed with him.",
            "One who slaughters cattle, a wild animal, or a bird, and no blood came out, they are valid and are eaten with unclean hands for they are not made fit to contract impurity by blood. Rabbi Shimon says, they are made fit by the slaughter.",

What case is being discussed? When it is previously held to be gravely ill. But if it was previously held to be healthy, even if did not have one of these signs, it is valid.",

Said Rabbi Eliezer, “Even if  he slaughtered it so that the non-Jew will eat from the edge of its liver, it is invalid, for the usual thought of a non-Jew is towards  idolatry.” Said Rabbi Yose, “These matters are [solved by] an a fortiori argument. Just as in a place where thought invalidates for <i>mukdashim</i> [animals or food which are holy and not available for general consumption] everything only follows the work, in a place where thought does not invalidate for <i>chulin</i> [produce or food permitted for general consumption], should it not be the rule that everything only follows the slaughtering?”",

[If] two grasp the knife and slaughter, one for the sake of one from all of these and one for the sake of something fitting, his slaughter is invalid.",
            "We may not slaughter into seas, nor into rivers, nor into vessels. But one may slaughter into a pool of water, and onto vessels [when] on a boat. We do not slaughter into a pit at all, but one makes a pit within his house so that the blood will go into it. But in the marketplace, one may not do as such so as to not imitate the heretics.",
            "One who slaughters for the sake of an <i>olah</i> [offering that is entirely burnt], for the sake of other sacrifices, for the sake of an <i>asham talui</i> [an offering brought to expiate a sin one is unsure of committing], for the sake of the <i>pesach</i> sacrifice, or for the sake of a thanksgiving offering, his slaughtering is invalid; and Rabbi Shimon validates. [If] two hold the knife and slaughter, one for the sake of one of these and one for the sake of something fitting, his slaughter is unfit. One who slaughters for the sake of a sin offering, for the sake of a guilt offering, for the sake of a first born offering, for the sake of a tithe, for the sake of <i>temurah</i> [an animal which has been substituted, wrongfully, for a sacrificial animal, and which thereby becomes sanctified for certain purposes], his slaughter is permitted. This is the general principle: anything which is vowed or voluntarily offered, when one slaughters for its sake, it is prohibited. For that which is neither vowed or voluntarily offered, when one slaughters for its sake, it is permitted."

An unfit animal is forbidden for eating [and] so too a <i>terefah</i> is forbidden for eating. Just as an impure animal is not purified by its slaughter, so should a <i>terefah</i> not be purified by its slaughter?

Take away what [the argument] you brought. Behold, if it is born as a <i>terefah</i> from the womb, from where would we derive this? [Rather], no.
