If <b>a majority of</b> the fetus <b>had</b> already <b>emerged,</b> it is considered to have been born and is therefore consecrated; consequently, if one cut it up <b>it must be buried, and</b> the mother animal is <b>exempted from</b> having <b>firstborn</b> status conferred on any future offspring.",

            "If <b>an animal was encountering difficulty giving birth and</b> as a result <b>the fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the mother’s womb, <b>and</b> someone <b>severed it and afterward slaughtered the mother</b> animal, <b>the flesh</b> of the fetus is <b>ritually pure.</b> If one first <b>slaughtered the mother</b> animal <b>and afterward severed</b> the foreleg, <b>the flesh</b> of both the mother animal and the fetus are ritually impure due to having been in <b>contact with a carcass.</b> Since the foreleg was not permitted to be consumed through the act of slaughtering, it is regarded as a carcass with the associated ritual impurity. The rest of the flesh, which was permitted to be consumed by the slaughter, was in contact with it and so was rendered ritually impure from it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The flesh has the ritual impurity of having been in <b>contact with a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered,</b> as the limb is regarded as a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered. By Torah law, although it is prohibited to consume it, it does not impart ritual impurity. Nevertheless, the Sages decreed that a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered, as well as anything that comes in contact with it, is regarded as ritually impure to the extent that it disqualifies sacrificial foods that come in contact with it. The Rabbis explain the rationale behind their opinion: <b>Just as we found in</b> the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> that its slaughter renders it ritually pure</b> according to Torah law, i.e., ritual slaughter prevents it from having the ritual impurity of a carcass despite not rendering the animal permitted for consumption, <b>so too, the slaughter of</b> the mother <b>animal should render the limb</b> of its fetus that left the womb <b>ritually pure,</b> despite the fact that its consumption is prohibited. <b>Rabbi Meir said to them: No, if the slaughter of a <i>tereifa</i> renders</b> the body of the animal <b>ritually pure,</b> it is because the slaughter is performed on <b>something that is</b> part of <b>its body,</b> i.e., its throat. Does it necessarily follow that <b>you should</b> also <b>render the limb</b> that left the womb <b>pure,</b> given that it is <b>something that is not</b> part of the mother’s <b>body?</b> Certainly not. The mishna asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i> that its slaughter renders it ritually pure,</b> i.e., prevents it from having the ritual impurity of a carcass? The mishna notes there is a reason to say the slaughter should not render it pure, as one can compare a <i>tereifa</i> with a non-kosher animal: <b>A non-kosher animal is prohibited for consumption; so too, a <i>tereifa</i> is prohibited for consumption.</b> Therefore, conclude: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a non-kosher animal, its slaughter does not render it ritually pure, so too</b> with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, its slaughter should not render it ritually pure.</b> The mishna questions the comparison: <b>No, if you said</b> that slaughtering cannot prevent an animal from having the ritual impurity of a carcass <b>in</b> the case of <b>a non-kosher animal, which</b> is distinct in that it <b>did not have a period of</b> potential <b>fitness</b> when slaughtering it could have rendered its consumption permitted, does it necessarily follow that <b>you should</b> also <b>say</b> this <b>in</b> the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, which did have a period of</b> potential <b>fitness?</b> Perhaps, since the animal had a period of potential fitness its slaughter remains effective in preventing it from having the ritual impurity of a carcass. The mishna rejects this distinction: <b>Take</b> back <b>to yourself</b> this claim <b>that you brought,</b> as it is insufficient. What about a case <b>where</b> an animal <b>was born as a <i>tereifa</i> from the womb,</b> and so it never had a period of potential fitness? For such a case, <b>from where</b> is it derived that its slaughter renders it ritually pure? The mishna reformulates the distinction: <b>No, if you say</b> that slaughtering cannot prevent a prohibited animal from having the ritual impurity of a carcass <b>with regard to a non-kosher animal, which</b> is distinct in that <b>there are no</b> animals <b>of its kind</b> that are permitted through <b>slaughtering,</b> as the Torah states the concept of slaughtering only with regard to kosher animals, does it necessarily follow that <b>you should</b> also <b>say</b> this <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i></b> kosher animal, given <b>that there are</b> other animals <b>of its kind</b> that are permitted through <b>slaughtering,</b> i.e., kosher animals that are not <i>tereifa</i>? Perhaps, since the concept of slaughtering is relevant to that kind of animal it can serve to prevent the animal from having the ritual impurity of a carcass even if the slaughter cannot render it permitted for consumption. The mishna notes: Based on this reasoning, one must conclude that with regard to <b>an eight-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus that was born <b>alive, slaughter does not render it ritually pure, as there are no</b> animals <b>of its kind</b> that are permitted through <b>slaughtering.</b> The Torah applies the concept of slaughter only with regard to animals that were born full term.",
            "In the case of <b>one who slaughtered an animal and found within it an eight-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, i.e., one that was not full term, whether it was <b>alive or dead, or a nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, i.e., one that was full term, that was <b>dead,</b> that fetus is permitted by virtue of the slaughter of its mother, as it is considered part of its mother. Therefore, its blood is considered part of its mother’s blood and is prohibited, so one must <b>tear</b> the fetus <b>and remove its blood</b> before it may be consumed. If <b>he found</b> within it <b>a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, <b>it requires</b> its own <b>slaughter,</b> as it is considered an independent full-fledged animal, <b>and</b> if one slaughters both the mother and fetus on the same day, <b>one is liable for</b> violating the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> on the same day; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Even when the fetus is nine months old, it is still considered part of its mother, and <b>the slaughter of its mother renders it permitted</b> for consumption. <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even</b> if the fetus emerged alive and <b>is</b> now <b>five years old and plowing in the field,</b> the earlier <b>slaughter of its mother rendered it permitted</b> and it does not require slaughter before it is eaten. But if <b>one tore</b> an animal, i.e., he killed it without slaughtering it, <b>and</b> inside <b>he found a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, everyone agrees that the fetus <b>requires</b> its own <b>slaughter because its mother was not slaughtered.</b>",
            "With regard to <b>an animal whose hind legs were severed,</b> if they were severed <b>from the leg joint and below,</b> the animal is <b>kosher; from the leg joint and above,</b> the animal is thereby rendered a <i>tereifa</i> and is <b>not kosher. And likewise,</b> an animal <b>whose convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh <b>was removed</b> is a <i>tereifa</i> and is not kosher. If <b>the bone</b> of a limb <b>was broken</b> but the limb was not completely severed, and the animal was then slaughtered, <b>if the majority of the flesh</b> surrounding the bone <b>is intact, the slaughter of</b> the animal <b>renders it permitted; but if not, its slaughter does not render it permitted.</b>",
            "In the case of <b>one who slaughters an animal and finds a placenta in its</b> womb, one with <b>a hearty soul [<i>nefesh hayafa</i>],</b> i.e., who is not repulsed by it, <b>may eat it,</b> as its consumption was permitted by virtue of the slaughter of the mother. Nevertheless, since generally speaking, people do not consume such placentas, it is not regarded as food <b>and</b> so it <b>cannot become impure</b> with <b>the ritual impurity of food</b> even were it to come into contact with a source of impurity. <b>And</b> furthermore, it does <b>not</b> impart <b>the ritual impurity of animal carcasses</b> as it was permitted by virtue of the slaughter of the mother. But if <b>one intended to</b> eat <b>it,</b> one thereby elevated it to the status of food, and the placenta <b>becomes impure</b> with <b>the ritual impurity of food</b> if it comes into contact with a source of impurity. <b>But</b> even so, it still does <b>not</b> impart the <b>ritual impurity of animal carcasses.</b> With regard to <b>a placenta, part of which emerged</b> from the womb before the mother was slaughtered, its <b>consumption</b> is <b>prohibited</b> even after the mother animal is slaughtered because the emergence of the placenta is <b>an indication of a fetus in a woman and an indication of a fetus in an animal.</b> Accordingly, there is a concern that the head of the fetus might have emerged in that part of the placenta, thereby rendering the fetus as having been born, a status that precludes it from being permitted by the slaughter of its mother. Since the offspring is prohibited, its placenta is likewise prohibited. If <b>an animal that was giving birth to its firstborn expelled a placenta, one may cast it to the dogs,</b> and one does not need to be concerned that the placenta came from a male fetus that has the consecrated status of a firstborn. <b>But in</b> the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals the placenta <b>must be buried,</b> because it came from a fetus that is assumed to have been sacred. The mishna adds: <b>But one may neither bury it at an intersection, nor may one hang it on a tree,</b> superstitious rites intended to prevent the animal from miscarrying again, <b>due to</b> the prohibition against following <b>the ways of the Amorite,</b> which prohibits Jews from practicing the superstitious rites observed by gentiles."

            "The mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool</b> that every Jew must give to the priest, as stated in the verse: “And the first sheared wool of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>] shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), <b>applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>in the presence of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> and <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals. <b>But</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to sacrificial</b> animals. There are more <b>stringent</b> elements <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw</b> (see 130a) <b>than</b> in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the first sheared wool</b> in <b>that</b> the mitzva of <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw applies to cattle and to sheep,</b> as it is written: “Whether it be ox or sheep, that he shall give unto the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3); and it applies <b>to numerous</b> animals <b>and to few</b> animals. <b>But</b> by contrast, the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool applies only to sheep</b> and not to goats and cattle, <b>and applies only to numerous</b> animals.",
            "<b>And how many are numerous? Beit Shammai say:</b> It is at least <b>two sheep, as it is stated: “That a man shall rear a young cow, and two sheep [<i>tzon</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 7:21), indicating that two sheep are characterized as <i>tzon</i>; and the mitzva of the first sheared wool is written using the term “your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>].” <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is at least <b>five</b> sheep, <b>as it is stated: “And five sheep [<i>tzon</i>] made”</b> (I Samuel 25:18). <b>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas says:</b> When shearing <b>five sheep,</b> the <b>sheared</b> wool of each sheep weighing <b>one hundred dinars</b> each <b>and half [<i>peras</i>]</b> of one hundred dinars each, i.e., one hundred and fifty dinars each, <b>are</b> subject to the <b>obligation of the first sheared wool,</b> i.e., they render the owner obligated to give the first sheared wool to the priests. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Any <b>five sheep,</b> each of whose <b>sheared</b> wool weighs <b>any amount,</b> render the owner obligated in the mitzva. <b>And how much</b> of the sheared wool <b>does one give to</b> the priest? One gives him sheared wool of the <b>weight</b> of <b>five <i>sela</i> in Judea, which are</b> the equivalent of <b>ten <i>sela</i> in the Galilee,</b> as the weight of the Galilean <i>sela</i> is half that of the Judean <i>sela</i>. Furthermore, although one may give the wool to the priest without laundering it, this must be the weight of the wool once <b>laundered and not</b> when <b>sullied,</b> as is characteristic of wool when sheared. The measure that must be given to the priest is <b>enough to fashion a small garment from it, as it is stated: “Shall you give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), indicating <b>that</b> the sheared wool <b>must contain enough for</b> a proper <b>gift.</b> If the owner of the shearing <b>did not manage to give it to</b> the priest <b>until he dyed it,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of the first sheared wool, as this constitutes a change in the wool by which means he acquires ownership of it. If he <b>laundered it but did not dye it,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to give the first sheared wool, as laundering does not constitute a change in the wool. <b>One who purchases the fleece of the sheep of a gentile</b> is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of giving <b>the first sheared wool</b> to the priest. With regard to <b>one who purchases the fleece of the sheep of another</b> Jew, <b>if</b> the seller <b>kept</b> some of the wool, then <b>the seller is obligated</b> to give the first sheared wool to the priest. If the seller <b>did not keep</b> any of the wool, <b>the buyer is obligated</b> to give it. If the seller <b>had two types</b> of sheep, <b>gray and white,</b> and he <b>sold</b> the buyer the <b>gray</b> fleece <b>but not</b> the <b>white</b> fleece, or if he sold the fleece of the <b>male</b> sheep <b>but not</b> of the <b>female</b> sheep, then <b>this</b> one, the seller, <b>gives</b> the first sheared wool <b>for himself</b> to the priest from the wool that he kept, <b>and that</b> one, the buyer, <b>gives</b> the first sheared wool <b>for himself</b> to the priest from the wool that he bought."
