            "\tOaths are two [i.e., Two are explicitly written in the Torah, viz. (Leviticus 5:4): \"Or if a soul swear, to pronounce with the lips, to do ill or to do good\": \"I shall eat\" — to do good; \"I shall not eat\" — to do ill, to deprive himself. The same applies with all things to be done or not to be done in the future, \"to do ill or to do good\" connoting the future.], which are four. [Another two, which are not written, are to be added: having done or not done in the past, e.g., \"I ate\" (when he did not eat); \"I did not eat\" (when he did eat)]. Awarenesses of uncleanliness [(Leviticus 5:2): \"Or if a soul touch any unclean thing,\" in respect to defiling the sanctuary and its sanctified objects] are two [Two are explicitly written (Ibid.): \"And it be hidden from him, and he is unclean,\" the implication being that his uncleanliness is \"hidden\" from him, for which reason he eats sanctified flesh — one; or enters the sanctuary — two], which are four. [Another two liabilities are to be added: \"hiddenness\" of sanctified flesh, and \"hiddenness\" of the sanctuary, when he is aware that he is unclean.] The yetzioth (forbidden acts of carrying) of Shabbath are two, which are four. [Carrying from the private to the public domain is derived from (Exodus 36:6): \"And Moses commanded and they passed a call through the camp, saying, etc.\" — Do not carry out from the private to the public domain. (\"two\":) one, for the man standing outside, who puts his hand inside, takes an object, and places it outside; and one for the man standing inside, who takes an object from its place and puts it outside. (\"which are four\":) There are to be added another two for placing inside, even though they are not written. For just as Scripture interdicted (transfer from) one domain to another by way of carrying out, so it interdicted placing within; one, for a man standing inside, stretching his hand outside, taking an object, and bringing it inside, and one for a man standing outside, taking an object from its place, and putting it down inside.] Observations of plague-spots are two [Two are explicitly written (Leviticus 13:2): \"se'eth\" and \"bahereth\"], which are four [the toldah (derivative) of se'eth and the toldah of bahereth, which are not explicitly written.]",
            "\tWherever there is awareness in the beginning, awareness in the end, and hiddenness in the middle, there is oleh veyored (\"sliding scale\") liability. [(\"Wherever there is awareness, etc.\":) This refers to \"Awarenesses of uncleanliness\" (above). Since their provisions are few, they are adduced first, after which oaths are adduced, their provisions being many. And the yetzioth (of Shabbath) and observations (of plague-spots) are treated individually in their respective tractates, for which reason they are not discussed here. They are included here (above) only because they are similar to the others in being \"two which are four.\" (\"awareness in the beginning\":) awareness that he has become unclean. (\"awareness in the end\":) After eating the sanctified food in \"hiddenness\" or entering the sanctuary in \"hiddenness\" and leaving, it becomes known to him that he ate or entered in uncleanliness. (\"and hiddenness in the middle\":) When he eats the sanctified food, his uncleanliness or its being sanctified food is hidden from him. Or he enters the sanctuary, and his uncleanliness or its being the sanctuary is hidden from him. (\"oleh veyored liability\":) \"oleh\" (\"rising\") for a rich man; \"yored\" (\"descending\") for a poor man. A rich man brings a beast sin-offering, and a poor man, a bird sin-offering; and the poorest of the poor, a tenth of an ephah (of flour), the \"sinner's meal-offering\" mentioned in many places.] Where there is awareness in the beginning and not at the end, the he-goat [of Yom Kippur] which is presented within [i.e., whose blood is presented within (the holy of holies)] and Yom Kippur suspend (his judgment) [protecting him from affliction] until he becomes aware [of having eaten sanctified food in a state of uncleanliness], whereupon he brings an oleh veyored offering.",
            "\tIf there were no awareness in the beginning [(i.e., If he never knew of this uncleanliness, this never becomes subject to an offering, an offering obtaining only where there was awareness in the beginning)], but there was awareness in the end, the kid presented outside [on the outer altar, with the additional Yom Kippur offerings] and Yom Kippur [itself] atone [with the kid], it being written (Numbers 29:11): \"…aside from the offering of atonement.\" Whatever the latter atones for, the former atones for. Just as the inner (altar sacrifice, \"the latter\") atones only where there was awareness, so the outer (altar sacrifice, \"the former\") atones only where there was awareness. [It is written of the kid presented outside: \"One kid of goats as a sin-offering, aside from the sin-offering of atonement.\" The sin-offering of atonement is the kid presented within. Scripture likens them to teach us that what one atones for, the other atones for, viz.: Just as the inner is presented only where there was awareness, (in that instance,) awareness in the beginning, as derived from (Leviticus 16:16): \"…for all of their sins,\" the implication being: for all that would be subject to a sin-offering if there were awareness at the end; and there is no sin-offering without awareness in the beginning — so the kid presented outside does not atone unless there was awareness, (in this instance,) awareness at the end, but not in the beginning, where it would never be subject to a sin-offering. And this atonement is absolute, without \"suspension\" (see 1:2)].",
            "\tAnd where there is no awareness, neither in the beginning nor in the end, the kids of the festivals [(Kids for sin-offerings are prescribed for the additional (mussaf) offerings of all the festivals)] and the kids of Rosh Chodesh atone, [it being written in respect to the kid of Rosh Chodesh (Numbers 28:15): \"as a sin-offering to the L rd\" — For a sin that only the L rd knows of, this kid atones. That is, where there is awareness neither in the beginning nor in the end. And the kids of the festivals are derived by identity from the kid of Rosh Chodesh. For \"kid\" could have been written in respect to all the festivals, and it is written (in respect to the festivals) \"and a kid,\" to add to what precedes (i.e., the kid of Rosh Chodesh), to liken them, i.e., These atone for the same thing that the first atones for.] These are the words of R. Yehudah. R. Shimon says: The kids of the festivals atone (for non-awareness in the beginning and in the end), but not the Rosh Chodesh kids. And for what do the kids of Rosh Chodesh atone? For a tahor (one who is clean) eating (unwittingly) something unclean. R. Meir says: The atonement of all of the kids is the same, (all atoning for) defiling the sanctuary and its holy objects. [All of the additional kids, whether the kids of the festivals, or the kid of Rosh Chodesh, or the kid presented outside on Yom Kippur — their atonement is the same. They atone both for unawareness in the beginning and awareness in the end, unawareness neither in the beginning nor in the end, and for a tahor eating something unclean. The (only) difference is in respect to uncleanliness occurring between one (offering) and the other. But as regards the kid presented inside on Yom Kippur, all agree that it \"suspends\" where there is awareness in the beginning but not at the end, as stated.] R. Shimon was wont to say: The kids of Rosh Chodesh atone for a tahor eating something unclean; those of the festivals atone for unawareness neither in the beginning nor in the end; and that of Yom Kippur, for awareness in the beginning, but not in the end. [This is repeated for the sake of what follows, viz.: \"They asked him, etc.\"] They asked him: May this be offered up for the other? [If the kid designated for Yom Kippur were lost, and atonement was made with another, and the first were found on a festival or on Rosh Chodesh, may it be used as the kid offering of the day?] He answered: They may be offered. They asked him: But if their atonement is not the same, how can one be substituted for the other? [R. Meir asks this of R. Shimon: If you grant that their atonement is the same, he can do so, for they all effect the same atonement. But, according to you, this one (the kid of Yom Kippur), which was designated to atone for unawareness in the beginning and awareness in the end — how can it be offered on the festival to atone for unawareness both in the beginning and in the end? Or on Rosh Chodesh, to atone for a tahor eating something unclean?] He answered: They all come to atone for defiling the sanctuary and its objects. [And since they are the same in this respect, even though there are differences in the type of atonement, it may be substituted.]",
            "\tR. Shimon b. Yehudah said in his [R. Shimon's] name [\"R. Shimon,\" unqualified, is R. Shimon b. Yochai]: The kids of Rosh Chodesh atone for a tahor eating something unclean. Over and above them are those of the festivals, which atone for a tahor eating something unclean and for unawareness in the beginning and in the end. Over and above them are those of Yom Kippur, which atone for a tahor eating something unclean, for unawareness in the beginning and in the end, and for unawareness in the beginning and awareness in the end. They asked him: May this be offered up for the other? He answered: Yes. They asked: If so, let those of Yom Kippur be offered on Rosh Chodesh; but how can those of Rosh Chodesh be offered on Yom Kippur for an atonement which is not of their kinds? (see 1:4) He answered: They all come to atone for defiling the sanctuary and its objects.",
            "\tAnd for willful defiling of the sanctuary and its sanctified objects [(This is a generic teaching)], the kid presented within and Yom Kippur atone, [it being written (Leviticus 16:16): \"and from their offenses for all of their sins.\" \"offenses\" (peshaim) — these are acts of rebellion.] And for the other transgressions of the Torah: light and stringent, willful and unwitting, known and unknown, positive commandment and negative commandment, krithoth and judicial death penalties, the sent-away kid atones. [The Gemara explains the entire Mishnah thus: whether light or stringent; whether he transgressed willfully or unwittingly; (Of those which he transgressed unwittingly,) whether their doubtful status was known to him or unknown to him (e.g., whether it was known or not known to him that it might be forbidden fat and he ate it). Which are the \"light\"? Positive and negative commandments. Which are the \"stringent\"? Those punishable by krithuth (cutting-off) and by judicial death penalty.]",
            "\tBoth Israelites, Cohanim, and the anointed priest (i.e., the high-priest) [are atoned for by the sent-away kid for the other transgressions (see above), there being no difference between them.] It is just that the blood of the bullock atones for the Cohanim for defiling of the sanctuary and of its sanctified objects. [i.e., Whatever the inner kid (of Yom Kippur) atones for on behalf of Israelites, i.e., suspending judgment for Israelites where there is awareness in the beginning but not at the end, and willful defiling of the sanctuary and its objects — likewise, whatever the outer kid atones for (on behalf of Israelites) — the bullock of the high-priest sacrificed on Yom Kippur atones for on behalf of the Cohanim.] R. Shimon says: Just as the blood of the kid presented within atones for Israel, so, the blood of the bullock atones for Cohanim. Just as the confession over the sent-away kid atones for Israel, so the confession over the bullock atones for the Cohanim. [i.e., You concede that the blood of the inner kid atones for Israel without confession, there being no confession over the inner kid, but over the sent-away kid — so the blood of the bullock atones for the Cohanim, without any confession, for defiling of the sanctuary and its objects, leaving the confession over the bullock (in place of the confession over the sent-away kid) to atone on behalf of the Cohanim for the other transgressions, and they have no atonement through the sent-away kid.]"

            "\tAwarenesses of uncleanliness are two, which are four. If he became unclean and knew [that he was unclean, at the time of contact or afterwards], and the uncleanliness was (afterwards) hidden from him, and he remembered the sanctity, [and because of that \"hiddenness\" (of the uncleanliness) he ate sanctified food — one; or entered the sanctuary — two. These are the two that are written. (Leviticus 5:2): \"And it be hidden from him and he is unclean\" implies that the uncleanliness is hidden from him. And because he is not liable unless he is aware in the beginning that he became unclean, after which it was hidden from him, we have \"awarenesses.\"] If the sanctity were hidden from him [i.e., the fact of its being sanctified food or the fact of its being the sanctuary, and he ate the one or entered the other], and he remembered his uncleanliness [—These are the two others, which are not written.] If both were hidden from him and he ate sanctified food unawares, and after he ate he became aware, he is liable for an oleh veyored offering. [This is not part of the number. We are just being apprised that even though when he ate the sanctified food or entered the sanctuary he remembered neither the uncleanliness nor the sanctuary, he is liable for an oleh veyored offering.] If he became unclean and knew it, and the uncleanliness was hidden from him, and he remembered the sanctuary; if the sanctuary were hidden from him, and he remembered his uncleanliness; if both were hidden from him, and he entered the sanctuary unawares, and when he left he became aware, he is liable for an oleh veyored offering.",
            "\t(He is liable for the offering) whether he enters the azarah [the first Temple court] or its [later]addition; for no addition is made to the city and to the azaroth without authorization [(for which reason it is sanctified as the first)] of the king, the prophet, the urim vetumim, the sanhedrin of seventy-one, the two thank-offerings, and song. The beth-din go, and the two thank-offerings behind them, and all of Israel behind them. The inner is eaten, and the outer burned. And if all of these do not obtain, if one enters there (in a state of uncleanliness), he is not liable (for an oleh veyored offering). [(\"with a king\":) it being written (Exodus 25:9): \"According to all that I show you: the form of the tabernacle, and the form of all its vessels, and thus shall you do.\" This (\"and thus shall you do\") is a superfluous verse, to be expounded as relating to future generations. And in the days of Moses, he was the king and the prophet, and his brother, the high-priest. And there were also the urim vetumim and the seventy elders — and thus for future generations. (\"two thank-offerings\":) two breads of thanksgiving. They would carry them in a circle until the end of the sanctified bound, where the first would be eaten, and the second burned. This is derived from (the rite of) Nechemiah ben Chachalyah, viz. (Nechemiah 12:31): \"Then I presented two great thanksgivings.\" (\"song\":) they would chant (Psalms 30) \"I shall extol You, O L rd, for You have uplifted me.\" And in the second Temple, even though there was neither king nor urim vetumim, the original sanctification of the Temple by Solomon \"took\" for its time and for the future, and what Nechemiah did was by way of commemoration alone.] And all (additions) that were made without all these (ceremonies) — If one (who were tamei) entered there, they (beth-din or the anointed high-priest as the case may be) are not liable (for a bullock of forgetfulness.)",
            "\tIf one became unclean in the azarah [and knew that he had become unclean], and his uncleanliness became \"hidden\" from him, and he remembered (that it was) the sanctuary; or if the sanctuary became \"hidden\" to him, and he remembered his uncleanliness; or if both became hidden from him, and he bowed down [in this interval of hiddenness towards the inside, even if he did not wait], or if he waited the amount of time for bowing down, [i.e., or if he bowed down towards the outside; this, if he waited the amount of time for bowing down, that being the amount of time it takes one to recite the following verse at moderate speed (II Chronicles 7:3): \"And they kneeled down with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and prostrated themselves to give thanks to the L rd. For He is good; for His lovingkindness endures forever.\"]; or if he left the long way, [and not the shorter way, even if he did not wait in the beginning], he is liable. And by the shorter way [when he did not bow down or wait], he is not liable. This is a positive commandment in the sanctuary [(Numbers 5:2): \"And they shall send out of the camp … everyone that is unclean\"] for which they [beth-din] are not liable [to offer a \"bullock of forgetfulness.\" That is, if they erred in this and instructed him to leave by the longer way, they do not bring for this mistaken ruling a bullock for forgetfulness of the congregation (see Leviticus 4:14)].",
            "\tAnd which is a positive commandment of niddah [comparable to that of the sanctuary, where the uncleanliness occurs after permitted entrance], where they [beth-din] are liable [for a bullock of forgetfulness if they erred in the ruling]? If he were cohabiting with a clean (non-niddah) woman [having \"entered\" permittedly], and she said to him: \"I have become unclean\" [now], and he withdrew immediately [with erect organ], he is liable, for his withdrawal is pleasurable to him as is his entry. [But he should wait without movement until the organ \"dies\" and withdraw when he has lost his erection. This is the positive commandment of niddah.]",

Akiva says: \"…and it be hidden from him and he is unclean\": He is liable for hiddenness of uncleanliness, but he is not liable for hiddenness of the sanctuary. R. Yishmael says: \"and it be hidden\" is written twice (verses 2 and 3), to make one liable for hiddenness of uncleanliness and for hiddenness of sanctuary. [R. Akiva holds that since he knew for a certainty that he had become unclean, even though the specific type of uncleanliness — sheretz or neveilah — is not known to him, he is liable. And both (R. Eliezer and R. Akiva) exempt him for hiddenness of sanctuary, and R. Yishmael holds him liable. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yishmael.]"

These are the words of R. Akiva. They asked him: Where do we find that one who eats any amount is liable, that this one should be liable! He countered: And where do we find that one who speaks brings an offering [for breaking his word] that this one should speak and bring an offering! [And since it is because of breaking his word (that he is liable), this, too, is breaking his word. For when one says \"I shall not eat,\" he means any amount.] \"I swear that I shall not eat,\" and he ate and drank, he is liable only for one (offering). [Even though drinking is included in eating, he is liable only for one, for it is as if he eats, and eats again, in one act of forgetfulness.] \"I swear that I shall not eat and that I shall not drink,\" and he ate and drank, he is liable for two. [This constitutes two oaths. And even though when he said \"I shall not eat,\" drinking (too) was forbidden to him, drinking being included in eating, so that when he then said \"I shall not drink,\" there is reason to say that one oath does not \"take\" on another (of the same kind), it is different here. For since he first said \"I shall not eat,\" and then, \"I shall not drink,\" it is made manifest that by \"eat\" he meant eating alone.]",

[His repeating \"loaf,\" \"loaf,\" indicates that he intended a distinct oath for each. For if he intended no more than to forbid these kinds to himself and no more, he would have said \"a loaf of wheat, and also of barley, and also of spelt.\"]",
            "\t\"I swear that I shall not drink,\" and he drank many (different kinds of) drinks, he is liable only for one. \"I swear that I shall not drink wine, and oil, and honey,\" and he drank, he is liable for each one. [The Gemara construes this as an instance of one's urging him: \"Come and drink with me wine, oil, and honey.\" (If he intended one oath,) he would have said \"I swear I shall not drink with you,\" and no more, the oath applying to what was being urged upon him. Why \"wine, oil, and honey,\" if not to render them distinct?]",

[For they are fit for eating; it is just that the Torah forbids them.] R. Shimon rules not liable. [For he is already besworn (by the Torah) against them. And the dispute between R. Shimon and the first tanna obtains where he includes permitted things with forbidden ones, as where he says \"I swear that I shall not eat slaughtered meat and treifoth.\" The first tanna holds that since the oath \"takes\" with slaughtered meat, it also takes with treifoth, for one prohibition takes effect upon another in the instance of an inclusive prohibition. And R. Shimon holds that it does not. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.] If one says: \"I bevow my wife benefit from me if I have eaten today,\" and he had eaten carrion and treifoth, forbidden animals and reptiles, his wife is forbidden (to benefit from him). [For he had eaten foods. And even R. Shimon (agrees in this.) For the reason he rules not liable in the first instance is not that they are unfit for eating but because an oath does not take on something forbidden.]",

[Two types are implied: Things like sleeping and things devoid of benefit, e.g. \"I shall throw a stone into the sea.\"] How so? I swear that I shall give that man or that I shall not give. That I have given or that I have not given. That I shall sleep or that I shall not sleep. That I have slept or that I have not slept. That I shall throw a rock into the sea or that I shall not throw. That I have thrown or that I have not thrown. R. Yishmael says: He is liable only for the future, it being written (Leviticus 5:4): \"to do ill or to do good.\" R. Akiva said to him: If so (he should be liable) only for things involving ill or good. Whence do I derive (that he is also liable for) things not involving ill or good? He answered: From the amplification of the verse, [(Ibid.): \"…for all that a man will pronounce.\"] R. Akiva: If the verse was amplified for this (i.e., all things), it was also amplified for that (i.e., to include the past). [The (rationale) of the dispute between R. Akiva and R. Yishmael: In all the Torah, R. Akiva expounds amplification and limitation, and R. Yishmael, general and particular. R. Akiva expounds: \"Or if a soul swear\" — amplification; \"to do ill or to do good\" — limitation; \"for all that a man will pronounce\" — reversion to amplification. Amplification - limitation - amplification — Everything is included. What is included? All past things are included (for oath liability) just as future (things are indicated.) And what is excluded? Oaths involving mitzvoth. And R. Yishmael expounds: \"Or if a soul swear\" — general; \"to do ill or to do good\" — particular; \"for all that a man will pronounce\" — reversion to general. General - particular - general — What is derived must accord with the nature of the particular. Just as the particular is explicitly in future state, so all must be in future state.

Betheira he should be liable [by reason of an oath of pronouncement.] (For) R. Yehudah b. Betheira said: Now if with something optional, for which he is not besworn from Mount Sinai, he is liable for it — a mitzvah, for which he is besworn from Mount Sinai, does it not follow that he should be liable for it! They said to him: No, it is so with an oath for something optional, where not doing is equated with doing, [it being written \"to do ill or to do good,\" implying something which may either be done or not done], as opposed to an oath for a mitzvah, where not doing is not equated with doing, so that if he swears to refrain from doing and does not do so, he should not be liable.

But if he first said: \"I shall not eat it,\" and then: \"I shall not eat,\" and he ate the whole thing, he is liable for two. For when he says: \"I shall not eat it,\" he is not liable until he eats the whole thing, and when he then says: \"I shall not eat,\" once he eats an olive-size of it, he is liable. Therefore, the second oath takes, and he is liable when he eats an olive-size of it. And when he then eats the whole thing, he is liable by reason of the first oath. (\"I swear that I shall not eat it. I swear that I shall not eat it\":) Even though the second oath, \"I shall not eat it,\" is enough to apprise us that one oath does not \"take\" on the other, the third is still taught to apprise us that even though there is no liability for the latter oaths, they are nonetheless oaths, and not vain words, and if they can \"find a place,\" they take effect. For if a sage absolves him of the first, the second takes effect and it is forbidden to him by reason of the second oath. Likewise, if he is absolved of the first two, the third takes effect. For the sage uproots the vow completely, so that it is as if he had never vowed, and the second \"takes\" retroactively, the first being regarded as non-existent once he has been absolved of it.] This is an oath of pronouncement, where for willful transgression one is liable to stripes, and for unwitting transgression, to an oleh veyored offering. With a vain oath, for willful transgression one is liable to stripes, and for unwitting transgression, he is not liable.",

And it answers that our Mishnah is speaking of an instance where the witnesses in the second set were kin through their wives, not being kasher to testify when the second set denied, and their wives were gosesoth (at the point of death).

One who is liable to a Torah mandated oath must hold an object in his hand (e.g., a Torah scroll or teffillin) when he swears; and one who is liable to a shvuath heseth does not hold an object in his hand, but the beadle of the congregation or the one who beswears him holds an object in his hand while the oath is being taken. There are only three Torah mandated oaths, and no more: (the oath for) one who admits part of the claim, (the oath administered) where one witness testifies against him and he swears in refutation of the witness, and the oath of the watchers (shomrim). All of the other oaths mentioned in the Mishnah are rabbinically prescribed, and are similar to Torah oaths in that an object is held.

And one is not besworn for hekdesh, it being written (Ibid. 9): \"If a man give to his neighbor\" — and not (property) of hekdesh.] They are not subject to double payment (kefel), [kefel being paid only for those things which are included in that section as being of the nature of the particular] and they are not (subject to) four and five payment. [For wherever kefel does not obtain, there is no four and five payment. For the absence of kefel makes it a payment of three and four; and the Torah specifies \"four and five\" payment, and not \"three and four.\"], a shomer chinam (an unpaid watcher) does not swear (for those things) [The only thing to which a shomer chinam is liable is an oath, it being written (Exodus 22:7): \"Then the master of the house (the shomer chinam) shall draw near to the judges (to take an oath) that he did not send his hand, etc.\"; and that section speaks of a shomer chinam. And he is not besworn for bondsmen, land, and bills, it being written (Ibid. 6): \"If a man give to his neighbor\" — general; \"money or vessels\" — particular; \"to watch\" — reversion to the general. \"General-particular-general\" — The ruling follows the nature of the particular, viz.: Just as the particular is explicitly something movable and of intrinsic monetary value, so all, etc.: to exclude land, which is not movable, etc. And for all of the aforementioned he is not subject to a Torah mandated oath, but he is always liable for a shvuath heseth.], a nosei sachar (a paid watcher) does not pay (for those things). [(He does not pay) for theft and loss for which Scripture makes him liable, viz. (Ibid. 11): \"If stolen it shall be stolen from him, he shall pay to its owner.\" But for bondsmen, land, and bills, he does not pay, it being written in respect to a shomer sachar (Ibid. 9): \"If a man give to his neighbor\" — general; \"an ass or an ox or a lamb or any beast\" — particular; \"to watch\" — reversion to the general, etc., as stated above. \"his neighbor\" is written both in respect to shomer chinam and shomer sachar, implying his neighbor, and not hekdesh. Shoel (a borrower and socher (a hirer) are not mentioned here to exclude bondsmen, land, bills, and hekdesh. For borrowing generally does not obtain with land and bills; much more so hiring, which cannot apply to bills. Likewise, borrowing and hiring do not obtain with hekdesh, which it is forbidden to borrow or to hire.] R. Shimon says: Kodshim (sanctified objects) which the owner is bound to restore (if they are lost) are subject to an oath; those which he is not bound to restore are not subject to an oath.",
            "\tR. Meir says: There are things which are like land and which are not like land; and the sages do not concur with him. How so? (If one says:) \"I gave you ten laden vines,\" and the other says: \"They are only five,\" R. Meir requires an oath, and the sages say: Whatever is attached to the ground is like the ground. [Grapes awaiting harvest are the point of difference between the sages and R. Meir. According to R. Meir, grapes awaiting harvest are regarded as harvested, and according to the sages, they are not regarded as harvested. The halachah is in accordance with the sages. And this, only in respect to watchers (shomrim), but in respect to buying and selling and ona'ah (overcharging), and admitting part of the claim — in all of these they hold that what awaits harvesting is regarded as harvested. And this is the halachah.] An oath is taken only on something that can be measured or weighed. How so? (If one says:) \"I gave you a house full (of produce),\" or: \"I gave you a pouch full (of money),\" and the other says: \"I don't know, but take what you put down,\" he is exempt (from an oath). If one says: \"Until the ziz\" [a beam of the upper story projecting from inside the house], and the other: \"Until the window,\" he is liable.

If the pledge were lost or stolen, and it were as much as the (amount of) the debt, the (loss of) the pledge cancels the debt and neither has a claim against the other. If the debt were more than the pledge, the borrower pays the lender the difference. If the pledge were more than the debt, the lender pays the borrower. And if it were lost by accident, in which instance a shomer sachar is not liable, the lender, too, is not liable. He swears that it was lost by accident and collects the entire debt.] — If the pledge were lost: If he said: \"I lent you a sela for it, and it (the pledge) was worth a shekel [half a sela],\" and the other said: \"No, you lent me a sela and it was worth a sela,\" he is exempt (from an oath). (If one said:) \"I lent you a sela for it, and it was worth a shekel,\" and the other said: \"No, you lent me a sela for it and it was worth three dinars,\" he is liable.

(If one said:) \"You lent me a sela for it, and it was worth two,\" and the other said: \"No, I lent you a sela for it, and it was worth five dinars,\" he is liable. And who swears [first]? The one who held the pledge. [i.e., The lender, who held the pledge, swears that he no longer has it], lest this one (the borrower) swear, and the other (the lender) produce the pledge. [Since the borrower must swear how much his pledge was worth, and the lender must swear that he does not have the pledge, even if he pays for it, (for we are afraid that he might have \"cast his gaze upon it\"), beth-din beswear the lender first that he does not have it, and then they beswear the borrower as to its worth, lest the borrower swear first without being particular about its true worth, and the lender then produce the pledge and disqualify him for testimony and oath.]"

            "\tAll of those who are besworn by Torah mandate swear and do not pay. [The Torah did not mandate that the claimant swear and take, but that the claimee swear and not pay, it being written (Exodus 22:10): \"And its master shall take it, and he shall not pay\" — He who is being asked to pay takes the oath.] And these swear and take [The sages ordained that they swear and take. They are all explained later in the Mishnah:] a hired laborer, one who has been robbed, one who has been struck, one whose opposite is not trusted to take an oath, and a shopkeeper over his ledger. A hired laborer — how so? [The sages ordained that a hired laborer swear and take; for the employer is busy with his workers and may not remember. This, when he claims within the prescribed time: a day-laborer, all of the night following, and a night-laborer, all of the day following. But if he claimed after his time, the employer takes a shvuath heseth that he paid him and he is exempt. Also, if he did not hire him in the presence of witnesses, the hired laborer does not swear and take. For since he can tell him: \"I never hired you,\" he can also tell him: \"I hired you and I paid you.\"] If he said to him: \"Give me the pay that you owe me\" — If the other said: \"I gave it to you,\" and he: \"I did not receive it,\" he (the hired laborer) swears and takes it. [But if the laborer said to him: \"You stipulated that you would give me two,\" and the employer: \"I stipulated only one,\" the employer swears a Torah mandated oath that it is as he says, and he gives him only one.] R. Yehudah says: (He does not swear) unless there is partial admission. How so? As when he said: \"Give me my pay, fifty dinars, that you owe me,\" and the other said: \"You received a golden dinar (twenty-five silver dinars).\" [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah, neither in the instance of a hired laborer, nor in that of one who has been robbed or beaten.]",
            "\tOne who has been robbed — how so? If they testified against him that he entered the other's house to take a pledge from him without being authorized to do so, [as when witnesses saw him enter the other's house with nothing in his hand and he left with vessels projecting from the folds of his garment] — He says: \"You took my vessels\"; the other says: \"I did not,\" he (the claimant) swears and takes. [For the indications are (that he did steal). For the witnesses testify that he took a pledge without authorization. This, when he claims something which he is likely to own, but if he claims \"a silver chalice,\" or the like, which he is not likely to own, it is not for him to swear and take (in all instances), but the claimee swears and exempts himself.] R. Yehudah says: (He does not swear) unless there is partial admission. How so? As when he said: \"You took two vessels,\" and the other said: \"I took only one.\"",
            "\tOne who has been struck — how so? If they testified that he went into him whole and came out with a wound, and he said: \"You struck me,\" and the other said: \"I did not,\" he (the claimant) swears and takes (compensation). [This, only where the wound is in a place where it could have been self-inflicted, for which reason an oath is required. But where this is not possible, and it is evident that another must have caused it, as when tooth marks appear on his back and no one else (but the accused) was there, he collects without an oath.] R. Yehudah says: (He does not swear) unless there is partial admission. How so? As when he said: \"You struck me twice,\" and the other said: \"I struck you only once.\"",

(The other swears) whether (his opposite had transgressed in) an oath of testimony, or in an oath over a pledge, or even with a vain oath. [i.e., Not only where he has transgressed in an oath of testimony or in an oath over a pledge, where there is denial of money — \"evil to Heaven and evil to man\" — but even with a vain oath, where there is only evil to Heaven, his opposite swears and takes. An oath of pronouncement is not included, for it may be future-directed, such as \"I shall eat\" or \"I shall not eat,\" where the oath is a truthful one, his intent being to fulfill it, so that even though he is overcome by his evil inclination and transgresses, this does not render him not trusted to take an oath. But an oath of pronouncement concerning the past, such as \"I ate\" or \"I did not eat,\" is like a vain oath, for he swears falsely.] If one of them were a gambler, or a lender on interest, or a pigeon-flyer, or a dealer in [the fruits of] the sabbatical year (shevi'ith), his opposite swears and takes. [(If one of them were, etc.\":) First those unfit by Torah law are taught, and then those who are unfit by rabbinical ordinance. (\"a pigeon-flyer\":) some understand this as: \"If your pigeon comes in before mine, I will give you so much and so much,\" i.e., gambling. Others understand it as training a pigeon to fly other pigeons to one's coop, this being \"theft in violation of the ways of peace.\" (\"a dealer in shevi'ith\":) It is written (Leviticus 25:6): \"to eat\" — and not for trade.] If both of them were suspect (i.e., not trusted to swear), the oath returns to its place. These are the words of R. Yossi. [In the Gemara, some explain this as \"it returns to Sinai,\" i.e., to the oath of Mount Sinai, where the Holy One Blessed be He beswore Israel: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" and He will exact payment from the one who denies it to his neighbor; but beth-din need not resort either to oath or to (enforcement of) payment. And others explain it as: \"it returns to the one who is liable to it,\" i.e., the one who admits part; and since he is not trusted to swear, he pays.] R. Meir says: They divide.",
            "\tAnd a shopkeeper over his ledger — how so? Not that he says to him: \"Write in my ledger that you owe me a hundred zuz,\" but (we are speaking of an instance in which) he said to him (the shopkeeper): \"Give my son two sa'ah of wheat,\" or \"Give my workers change of a sela.\" He says: \"I gave,\" and they say: \"We did not receive,\" he swears and takes, and they swear and take (from the employer). [For the shopkeeper says to him: \"I do not trust the workers to take an oath. You trusted them for you did not tell me to give it to them in the presence of witnesses.\" And the workers, likewise, say to the shopkeeper: \"We do not trust you to swear.\" And when they both swear and take from the employer, they swear before each other, so that either the shopkeeper (will be deterred) by shame before the workers, or the workers before the shopkeeper.] Ben Naness said: How can this be done? These will utter a vain oath or those will utter a vain oath! [For, perforce, one will swear falsely, and the Name of Heaven will be desecrated.] Rather, he takes without an oath and they take without an oath. [The halachah is not in accordance with Ben Naness.]",
            "\tIf he said to the shopkeeper: \"Give me fruits for a dinar,\" and he gave them to him, [and the fruits are piled in the public domain, with neither of them in possession] — If he said: \"Give me the dinar,\" and the other said: \"I gave it to you, and you put it in your money-bag,\" the customer swears, [an oath similar to that of the Torah, and he takes (the fruits). For since the shopkeeper admits that he made the sale and the fruits are outside his shop, the customer swears and takes.] If he gave him the dinar and said: \"Give me the fruits,\" and he said: \"I gave them to you and you took them home, [and these piled up fruits are mine; I put them here to sell.\" And the other: \"These are the fruits that you sold me for a dinar,\" since the buyer admits the sale, and the shopkeeper denies having sold these], the shopkeeper swears an oath similar to that of the Torah and he takes (the fruits). R. Yehudah says: Whoever has possession of the fruits has the upper hand. [R. Yehudah differs with the last ruling, saying that in both cases the customer swears and takes. For since the fruits are outside the shop, it is as if they are in the customer's hand. And whoever has possession of the fruits has the upper hand, and he swears and takes.] If he said to a moneychanger: \"Give me change of a dinar,\" and he gave it to him — If he said to him: \"Give me your dinar,\" and he said to him: \"I gave it to you and you put it in your money-bag,\" the customer swears. If he gave him the dinar and he said: \"Give me the change,\" and he said: \"I gave it to you and you threw it into your pouch,\" the moneychanger swears. R. Yehudah says: It is not the way of a moneychanger to give an issar (small coin) before he takes the dinar. [The tanna apprises us of the difference between R. Yehudah and the rabbis both in respect to the change of the moneychanger and the fruits of the shopkeeper. For if he apprised us only of the latter, I might think that it is only with fruits that the rabbis said that if he said: \"I gave them to you and you took them home,\" the shopkeeper swears and takes, for a shopkeeper is wont to give the fruits before he takes the dinar; but with a moneychanger, who is not wont to give issarin before he takes the dinar, perhaps they would concur with R. Yehudah that the customer always swears and takes. And if he apprised us only of the former, I might think that the customer always swears and takes because the moneychanger is not wont to give issarin before he takes the dinar; but with a shopkeeper, who is wont to give the fruit before he takes the money, I might say that he concurs with the rabbis. We must, therefore, be apprised of both. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",
            "\tJust as they said (Kethuvoth 9:7) that a woman who \"impairs\" her kethubah [i.e., who produces her kethubah and admits that she has received partial payment] exacts payment only with an oath [if her husband claims that she has received the whole], and that if one witness testifies that it has been paid, she exacts payment only with an oath, and (that if she came to claim her kethubah) from bound property or from the property of the orphans, she exacts payment only with an oath, or that if she is paid not in his (her husband's) presence, she exacts payment only with an oath [(All revert to \"Just as\" (above), i.e., Just as none of these exacts payment without an oath)], so the orphans exact payment only with an oath. That is, orphans who exact payment from other orphans do so only with an oath. Our Mishnah speaks of an instance where the orphans who are being asked to pay say: We do not know whether or not our father paid this debt. But if they claim: Our father told us that he never borrowed this money and had never incurred this debt, then the orphans who produce the bill against the others exact payment without an oath. For saying \"I did not borrow\" is tantamount to saying \"I did not pay,\" and they cannot refute the witnesses who testify that their father did borrow this money. And we are taught that with an oath these orphans do exact payment from the others only in an instance where the creditor died in the debtor's lifetime; but if the debtor died in the creditor's lifetime, the creditor is already obliged to swear to the sons of the debtor that he received nothing. For one who exacts payment from orphans, even with a bill (of indebtedness) must swear. And one does not bequeath to his sons money for which he is obliged to swear, the sons not being able to take an oath for which their father is liable. But though this is the halachah, if a judge ruled that the orphans swear \"Our father did not charge us, etc.\" in order to exact payment from the other orphans thereby, what is done is done.[ (What is the oath?) \"We swear that father did not charge us [at the time of his death], and did not inform us [before that time, that the bill was paid], and we did not find among our father's bills (any indication) that this bill was paid.\" R. Yochanan b. B'roka says: Even if the son was born after the father's death, he swears and takes. [He swears that he did not find among his father's bills (any indication) that this bill was paid. This is the halachah.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel said: If there are witnesses that the father said at the time of his death: \"This bill has not been paid,\" he (the son) takes without swearing. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel.]",
            "\tAnd these swear without a [definite] claim(against them) [but only with a tentative one, i.e., \"Is it possible that you withheld something of mine?\" And because all of these (that follow) are inclined to rationalize (appropriating things for themselves) in that they exert themselves with the property, the rabbis imposed an oath upon them]: partners, tenant-farmers, caretakers, [who manage one's money for him. But with a caretaker of orphans — if beth-din appoints him he swears; if the father of the orphans appoints him, he does not swear.], a woman who carries on trade in the house, [her husband having made her a shopkeeper or a caretaker for his property], and a \"son of the house\" [one of the brothers, who deals with the property after the father's death.] If he asks: \"What are you claiming from me\"? (and the other replies:) \"I want you to swear to me,\" he is liable (to do so). If the partners or the tenant-farmers divided [and did not make him swear at the time of the division], they cannot make him swear [thereafter]. If an oath were \"rolled on\" to him [by them, afterwards], for something else, they can \"roll\" everything [including this] upon him. [And just as \"rolling on\" obtains with a Torah mandated oath, and with an oath similar to a Torah oath, so does it obtain with a shvuath heseth.] And shevi'ith (the sabbatical year) \"releases\" the oath. [Not the oaths of partners, for shevi'ith dissolves neither partnership nor its oath. It is, rather, a loan and its oath that it releases.]"
