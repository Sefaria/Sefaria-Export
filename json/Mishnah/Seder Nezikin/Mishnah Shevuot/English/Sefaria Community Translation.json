If he gave him the <i>dinar</i>, he said to him, give me the coins, he said to him, I gave it to you, and you threw them into your pouch, the money changer should swear. Rabbi Yehudah says, it is not the way of the money changer to give an <i>issar</i> [a coin worth eight <i>perutah</i> until he takes his <i>dinar</i>.",
            "Just as they said, the one who impairs [the value of] her <i>ketubah</i> [marriage contract] it can only be paid by oath, and one witness testifies that it has been paid, it can only be paid by oath, from mortgaged property or from property of orphans, it can only be paid by oath, and she who collects [her <i>ketubah</i>] not in the presence[ of her husband], it can only be paid by oath. So too orphans, they can only be paid by oath, an oath that our father did not advise us, an oath that our father has not said anything to us,  and we did not find [anything] among the documents of father, that this document is paid. Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah says, even the son who was born after the death of the father, swears and receives. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, if there are witnesses, that the father said at the time of his death, this document has not been paid, he receives without an oath.",
            "And these swear without a claim, the partners, tenant-farmers, administrators, and the woman who does transactions in the house, and the son of the house [member of the household]. If he said to him, what do you claim of me? It is my desire that you swear to me, he is liable. If the partners or tenant-farmers divide, he is not able to make them swear, if the oath was transferred from another claim, they transfer upon him everything. And the Sabbatical year cancels the oath."

            "There are four types of guardians: an unpaid guardian, a borrower, a paid watchmen and a renter.  An unpaid guardian swears for all types of cases [to exempt himself from payment], the borrower pays in all cases.  A paid guardian and a renter take an oath in the case of the animal breaking a limb, being captured [by an army] or if it dies but pay in the case of the animal being lost of stolen.  ",
            "If he said to the unpaid guardian where is my ox and he said it died, but in reality it broke a limb or was captured or was stolen or was lost.  Or he claimed it broke a limb but in reality it died or was captured or stolen or was lost.  It was captured, but in reality it died or broke a limb or was stolen or was lost. It was stolen but in reality it died or broke a limb or was captured or was lost.  It was lost but in reality it died or was broken or captured or stolen, and the owner said swear to me and he said <i>Amen</i>, agreed, the guardian is exempt (from an <i>asham</i> sacrifice). ",
            "If he asked where is my ox? and [the unpaid guardian] said to him I dont know what you're talking about but in reality it died or broke a limb or was captured or was stolen or was lost, and the owner said swear to me and he said <i>Amen</i>, agreed, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].  If he asked, where is my ox and he answered it was lost, if he said swear to me and he said <i>Amen</i>, agreed, but witnesses testify that in reality he  ate it, the guardian pays the value of the ox.  If he admitted on his own, he pays the value of the ox plus a fifth of its value and must bring an <i>asham</i>.  If he asked, where is my ox and he answered it was stolen, he said swear to me and the guardian said <i>Amen</i>, agreed, but witnesses testify that in reality he really stole it, he must pay double the value of the ox.  If he admitted on his own he pays the value of the ox plus a fifth of its value and must bring an <i>asham</i>.",
            "If he said to someone in the marketplace where is my ox that you stole?  And he says I did not steal it and witnesses testify that he did steal it, the thief must pay double [the value of the ox].  If he slaughtered it and sold it he pays four or five times [its value].  If he saw witnesses coming and he said I stole it but did not slaughter or sell it, he only pays the principle.  ",
            "If he asked the borrower where is my ox? and he answered it died, but in reality it broke a limb or was captured or was stolen or lost.[He said] it broke a limb but in reality it died or was captured or was stolen or was lost. [He said] it was captured but in reality it died or it broke a limb or it was stolen or it was lost.  [He said] it was stolen but in reality it died or broke a limb or was captured or lost. [He said] it was lost but in reality it died or broke a limb or was captured or lost and he said swear to me and he said <i>Amen</i>, agreed, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].",
            "If he asked [the borrower] where is my ox, and he said I don't know what you're talking about, but in reality it died or broke a limb or was captured or was stolen or lost and he said swear to me and the borrower said <i>Amen</i>, agreed, he is obligated [to bring a sacrifice].  If he said to the paid guardian or the renter where is my ox? and he said it died, but in reality it broke a limb or was captured.  [He said] it broke a limb but in reality it died or was captured. [He said] it was captured, but in reality it died or broke a limb. [He said] it was stolen but in reality it was lost. [He said] it was lost but in reality it was stolen if he says swear to me and he says <i>Amen</i>, agreed, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].  [He said] it died or broke a limb or was captured but in reality it was stolen or lost and he said swear to me and he said <i>Amen</i>, agreed, he is obligated [to bring a sacrifice].  [He said] it was lost or stolen but in reality it died or broke a limb or was captured and he said swear to me and he said  <i>Amen</i>, agreed, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].  This is the rule, any claim that changes from one obligation [to pay] to another obligation or from one exemption to another exemption, or from an exemptin to an obligation, he is exempt [from a sacrifice].
