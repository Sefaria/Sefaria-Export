            "With regard to <b>oaths</b> on an utterance of the lips, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types. The Torah specifies only two types of oaths whose violation renders one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering to atone for his transgression (see Leviticus 5:4): Where a person takes an oath to perform some action, and where he takes an oath to refrain from performing some action. With regard to both types, the Torah explicitly mentions liability only for an oath pertaining to one’s future behavior. Nevertheless, the Sages derive that one is also liable for a violation of both types of oaths when they pertain to one’s past behavior. Accordingly, although only two types are explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the Sages derive that there are actually four types. The mishna lists similar groups of <i>halakhot</i>. With regard to cases of <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple by entering it while one is ritually impure, or defiling its sacrificial foods by partaking of them while one is ritually impure, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> It is prohibited for an impure person to enter the Temple (see Numbers 19:20) or to partake of its sacrificial foods (see Leviticus 7:19–20). If one transgressed either prohibition during a lapse of awareness, then upon becoming aware of his transgression, he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering (see Leviticus 5:2). The Torah specifies that one is liable to bring the offering only in the case in which he had a lapse of awareness of the fact that he was impure. The Sages derive that one is liable not only in these two cases, but also where he was aware of his personal status but had a lapse of awareness concerning the identity of the place he was entering or the status of the foods he ate. With regard to acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> On Shabbat, it is prohibited to transfer an item from domain to domain. The Torah explicitly refers to only two cases, both of which involve an item being transferred from a private domain to a public domain: Where the transfer is made by a person who remains in the public domain, and where the transfer is made by a person who remains in the private domain. The Sages derive that liability is incurred in these cases also if the item is transferred from the public domain to the private domain. Although only two types are mentioned by the Torah, the Sages derive that there are actually four types. With regard to <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks</b> on a person’s skin, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> The Torah specifies that if a leprous mark appears on a person’s skin, the afflicted person must undergo a process of purification and then bring various offerings. Part of the classification of these types of leprosy is based on their shade of white. Two types of marks are explicitly mentioned in the Torah, and the Sages derive that each of these two types has a secondary mark.",
            "The mishna returns to the subject of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods. It elaborates on which offerings atone for different cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods: In cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness,</b> i.e., he knew he was ritually impure and was aware of the sanctity of the Temple or foods involved <b>at the beginning,</b> i.e., before he transgressed, <b>and</b> had <b>awareness at the end,</b> i.e., after the transgression, <b>but</b> had <b>a lapse of awareness</b> of one of those two components <b>in between,</b> while he actually transgressed, <b>this</b> person is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering. For cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning,</b> transgressed during a lapse of awareness, <b>and</b> still <b>had no awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>suspend</b> any punishment that he deserves <b>until he becomes aware</b> of his transgression; <b>and</b> then to achieve atonement <b>he brings a sliding-scale</b> offering.",
            "For cases in which one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but had awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., the goat of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>atone, as it is stated</b> with regard to the offerings brought on Yom Kippur: “One goat for a sin-offering <b>aside from the sin-offering of the atonements”</b> (Numbers 29:11). The verse juxtaposes the internal and external goats together to teach that <b>for that which this</b> one <b>atones, that</b> one <b>atones. Just as the internal</b> goat, i.e., the one whose blood presentation is performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones only for a case in which there was awareness</b> of the components of the transgression at some point, i.e., at the beginning, <b>so too, the external</b> goat, i.e., the goat of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur, <b>atones only for a case in which there was awareness</b> at some point, i.e., at the end.",
            "<b>And for</b> cases in <b>which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end,</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as sin-offerings for the additional offerings <b>of the Festivals and</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as sin-offerings for the additional offerings <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons atone.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The <b>goats of the Festivals atone</b> for cases in which one never had awareness of the transgression, <b>but</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons</b> do <b>not. But</b> if so, <b>for what do</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone?</b> They atone <b>for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>all the goats</b> offered as additional offerings, those of the New Moons, Festivals, and Yom Kippur, <b>their atonement,</b> i.e., the atonement that they effect, <b>is the same;</b> they all atone <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple</b> by entering it while impure, <b>or</b> for the defiling of <b>its sacrificial</b> foods by partaking of them while impure. <b>Rabbi Shimon would say,</b> delineating his opinion as the mishna expresses it above: The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. <b>And</b> with regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals atone for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, and</b> the goats of the additional offerings <b>of Yom Kippur atone for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether</b> goats consecrated for different days <b>may be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? For example, if a goat was initially consecrated to be sacrificed as part of the Yom Kippur additional offerings, may it be sacrificed as part of the Festival additional offerings instead? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: They may be sacrificed. They said to him: Since,</b> according to you, <b>their atonement is not the same, how could they</b> possibly <b>be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> They can be interchanged, since ultimately <b>all of them come to atone for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods.",
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of</b> Rabbi Shimon a tradition of his opinion that differs from the way the mishna expresses it above: The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. The goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals exceed them, as they atone</b> both <b>for a pure</b> person <b>who partook of impure</b> sacrificial food <b>and</b> also <b>for</b> cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end.</b> The goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> further <b>exceed them, as they atone</b> both <b>for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food <b>and for</b> cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end; and</b> they also atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether</b> goats consecrated for different days <b>may be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one?

            "<b>And for</b> the <b>intentional defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, both the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>atone.</b> The mishna delineates how atonement is effected for other transgressions: <b>For</b> all <b>other transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah,</b> whether they are <b>the minor</b> ones <b>or the major</b> ones, whether they were <b>intentional or unwitting,</b> whether <b>one became aware</b> of them before Yom Kippur <b>or did not become aware</b> of them until after Yom Kippur, whether they involve <b>a positive mitzva or a prohibition,</b> whether the transgressors are subject to <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>] or</b> to one of the <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death penalties,</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> sent to Azazel on Yom Kippur <b>atones.</b>",
            "<b>Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, achieve atonement from the scapegoat equally. <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest?</b> The difference is <b>only that the priests achieve atonement for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods through <b>the bull</b> that the High Priest offers on Yom Kippur, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for defiling caused by them through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat, whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests.</b> And for all other transgressions, <b>just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests.</b>"

            "With regard to cases of <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple by entering it while one is ritually impure, or defiling its sacrificial foods by partaking of them while one is ritually impure, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> How so? If <b>one became ritually impure and he was aware</b> that he was impure, <b>but</b> afterward his <b>impurity was hidden from him, though he remembered</b> that he was partaking of <b>sacrificial</b> food, which is forbidden to one who is in a state of ritual impurity; this is one of the four types of awareness of impurity. If the fact that he was partaking of <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>was hidden from him, though he remembered the ritual impurity</b> that he had contracted; this is the second of the four types of awareness of impurity. And the same <i>halakha</i> applies if both <b>this and that were hidden from him,</b> both the fact that he was impure and the fact that he was partaking of sacrificial food. In all these cases, if <b>he partook of the sacrificial</b> food <b>and was unaware</b> either that he was impure, or that the food was sacrificial food, or both, <b>and after he partook of</b> it <b>he became aware</b> of that which he had forgotten, <b>he is</b> required to bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering. In this type of offering, the sinner sacrifices an animal, bird, or meal-offering, depending on his financial status. And similarly with regard to entering the Temple: If <b>one became ritually impure and he was aware</b> that he was impure, <b>but</b> afterward his <b>impurity was hidden from him,</b> though <b>he remembered</b> that he was entering <b>the Temple,</b> which is prohibited for one who is in a state of ritual impurity; this is the third of the four types of awareness of impurity.

And the same <i>halakha</i> applies if both <b>this and that were hidden from him,</b> both the fact that he was impure and the fact that he was entering the Temple. In all these cases, if <b>he entered the Temple and was unaware</b> either that he was impure, or that he was entering the Temple, or both, <b>and after he left he became aware</b> of what was hidden from him, <b>he is</b> required to bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering.",
            "As for the boundaries of the Temple with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, <b>the same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>one who enters the</b> area that was part of the original Temple <b>courtyard and</b> to <b>one who enters the</b> later <b>addition to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> because the additional section is sanctified with the full sanctity of the Temple courtyard. The mishna notes: <b>As, additions can be made to the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or to the</b> Temple <b>courtyards only by</b> a special body comprising the <b>king, a prophet, the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, and the Sanhedrin of seventy-one</b> judges, <b>and with two thanks-offerings and with</b> a special <b>song.</b> Once the addition to the courtyard is made by this body and this process, it is given the full sanctity of the original courtyard area. The mishna provides certain details of the consecration ceremony. <b>And the court</b> would <b>move</b> forward, <b>and two thanks-offerings</b> would be brought <b>after them, and all of the Jewish people</b> would follow <b>behind them.</b> When they would reach the end of the place that they desired to consecrate, <b>the inner</b> thanks-offering would <b>be eaten and the outer one</b> would <b>be burned.</b> The details of this ceremony will be described in the Gemara. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>any</b> addition to the Temple <b>that was not made with all these</b> ceremonial procedures, <b>one who enters there</b> while ritually impure <b>is not liable</b> to bring an offering if his entry was unwitting, nor to be punished with <i>karet</i>, excision from the World-to-Come, if his entry was intentional.",
            "The first part of the mishna discussed one who became ritually impure before entering the Temple. The mishna proceeds to consider a case involving one who was ritually pure when he entered the Temple but <b>who became impure</b> while <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, and</b> afterward, his <b>impurity was hidden from him</b> but <b>he remembered</b> that he was standing in <b>the Temple,</b> or the fact that he was standing in <b>the Temple was hidden from him</b> but <b>he remembered</b> his <b>impurity,</b> or both <b>this</b> fact <b>and that</b> fact <b>were hidden from him.</b> In all these cases, if <b>he bowed</b> down, <b>or he tarried</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>long enough to bow down</b> even though he did not actually bow, <b>or he went out</b> by way of <b>a longer</b> route when he could have taken a shorter route, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering. But if he left the Temple via <b>the shortest</b> way, he is <b>exempt.</b> <b>This</b> mitzva that the ritually impure must be sent out of the Temple <b>is the positive mitzva concerning the Temple for which,</b> as is taught elsewhere in the Mishna (<i>Horayot</i> 8b), the Sanhedrin <b>is not liable</b> to bring an offering for an erroneous ruling. A communal bull sin-offering is brought because of the unwitting transgression of a prohibition involving an action by the Jewish people resulting from an erroneous halakhic decision handed down by the Sanhedrin. But if the Sanhedrin mistakenly ruled that one who became impure while in the Temple may leave by way of a longer route, they do not bring this offering, as it is brought only for an erroneous ruling on a matter that requires the bringing of a fixed sin-offering, and not a sliding-scale offering, for its unwitting violation.",
            "<b>And which is the positive mitzva with regard to a menstruating woman for which,</b> as is taught in <i>Horayot</i> there, the Sanhedrin is <b>liable</b> to bring a bull offering for an erroneous ruling? If a man <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and</b> during the course of their act of intercourse <b>she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, and</b> unwittingly <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from her and did not wait until his penis became flaccid, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman, <b>because his withdrawal</b> from her <b>is as pleasant to him as his entry.</b> If the Sanhedrin mistakenly ruled that one may withdraw immediately, they bring a bull offering for their erroneous ruling.",
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to the sliding-scale offering the verse states: “Or if a person touches any impure thing, whether it is the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher <b>creeping animal, and it is hidden from him”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). A precise reading of this verse indicates that in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted ritual impurity by touching <b>a creeping animal,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering for having defiled the Temple or the sacrificial food, <b>but he is not liable</b> to bring such an offering in a case where he has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it is hidden from him, so that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), thereby teaching that in a case when one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>but</b> one <b>is not liable</b> to bring such an offering in a case when he has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:2), and it states: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:3), <b>twice,</b> in order <b>to render one liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering both in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted <b>ritual impurity and</b> in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple.</b>"

            "With regard to <b>oaths</b> attesting to the truth about an utterance, which, when violated, render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types. The initial two oaths, which relate to utterances about the future and are explicitly prohibited in the Torah, are: On my <b>oath I will eat, or:</b> On my oath <b>I will not eat.</b> These are expanded to four, to include oaths concerning utterances about the past: On my oath <b>I ate, or:</b> On my oath <b>I did not eat.</b> If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he</b> then <b>ate any amount,</b> even less than an olive-bulk, he is <b>liable;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Akiva: Where do we find that</b> one who <b>eats any amount is liable,</b> leading you to say <b>that this</b> person is <b>liable? Rabbi Akiva said to them: And where do we find one who speaks and</b> is liable to <b>bring an offering</b> for it, <b>as this</b> oath taker merely <b>speaks,</b> i.e., takes an oath, <b>and brings an offering</b> for it? If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate and drank, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering, because an oath to refrain from eating includes refraining from drinking. If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat and I will not drink, and</b> then he <b>ate and drank,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> offerings.",
            "If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate wheat bread and barley bread and spelt bread, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat wheat bread or barley bread or spelt bread, and</b> then he <b>ate</b> all of them, he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every one.</b> ",
            "If he said: On my <b>oath I will not drink, and</b> then he <b>drank several</b> kinds of <b>liquids, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering.

            "If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he ate foods that are inedible or drank liquids that are not potable,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate</b> the meat of unslaughtered <b>carcasses or <i>tereifot</i>, repugnant creatures or creeping animals,</b> he is <b>liable.

            "If one unwittingly takes a false oath about the past or breaks an oath he made about the future, <b>both</b> if it is an oath that addresses <b>matters that concern oneself and</b> if it is an oath that addresses <b>matters that concern others,</b> he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for an oath on an utterance. <b>And</b> likewise, an oath on an utterance may address <b>both tangible matters and intangible matters.</b> <b>How so?</b> Examples of oaths about future actions that concern others are if one <b>said:</b> On my <b>oath I will give so-and-so</b> a particular item, <b>or:</b> On my oath <b>I will not give</b> it to him. Examples of such oaths about the past are if one said: On my oath <b>I gave</b> another a particular item, <b>or:</b> On my oath <b>I did not give</b> it to him. Examples of oaths about the future that address intangible matters are where one said: On my oath <b>I will sleep, or:</b> On my oath <b>I will not sleep.</b> Examples of such oaths about the past are where one said: On my oath <b>I slept, or:</b> On my oath <b>I did not sleep.</b> Other examples of oaths about intangible matters are when one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will throw a stone into the sea, or: I will not throw</b> it, or: <b>I threw</b> it, <b>or: I did not throw</b> it. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One is liable only</b> for an oath on an utterance taken <b>about the future, as it is stated:</b> “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good,</b> whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath” (Leviticus 5:4). The Torah refers explicitly only to oaths about what one will do in the future. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: If so,</b> and one is liable only for oaths explicitly mentioned in the verse, then <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply.

            "<b>All</b> those <b>who take an oath that</b> is legislated <b>by the Torah take an oath and do not pay.</b> By Torah law, one takes an oath only in order to exempt himself from a monetary claim. <b>And these</b> litigants <b>take</b> a rabbinically instituted <b>oath and receive</b> possession of the disputed funds or property, i.e., their claim is upheld by means of the oath, even though they are not in possession of the property in question: <b>A hired worker</b> who claims that he has not received his wages; <b>and one who was robbed</b> and sues the person who robbed him; <b>and one who was injured,</b> who claims compensation from the person who injured him; <b>and one whose opposing</b> litigant is <b>suspect with regard to the</b> taking of an <b>oath.</b> When a person suspected of taking false oaths is liable to take an oath in order to exempt himself, the claimant takes an oath instead and receives payment. <b>And a storekeeper</b> relying <b>on his ledger</b> also takes an oath and is paid. <b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>the hired worker?</b> The case is where one <b>says to</b> his employer: <b>Give me my wages that are</b> still <b>in your possession.</b> The employer <b>says: I</b> already <b>gave</b> them to you. <b>And that</b> worker <b>says: I have not received</b> them.

            "These cases of taking an oath are <b>just like</b> other cases where the Sages <b>said</b> that one takes an oath and receives payment.

And likewise, orphans may collect</b> a loan <b>with</b> a promissory note inherited from their father <b>only by</b> taking <b>an oath.</b> Orphans who wish to collect payment of money owed to their father must take the following oath: On our <b>oath our father did not direct us</b> on his deathbed not to collect with this promissory note, <b>and our father did not say to us</b> that this note was paid, and <b>we did not find among our father’s documents</b> a record showing <b>that this</b> promissory <b>note was paid.</b> After taking that oath, they may collect the money. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: Even</b> if <b>the son was born after the father’s death, he</b> needs to <b>take an oath</b> in order to <b>receive</b> the money owed to his father. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: If there are witnesses that the father said at the time of his death: This</b> promissory <b>note has not been paid,</b> the son <b>collects</b> the debt <b>without</b> having to take <b>an oath.</b>",
            "<b>And these</b> people are sometimes required to <b>take an oath</b> that they do not owe anything even <b>when</b> there is <b>no</b> explicit <b>claim</b> against them: <b>Partners, sharecroppers, stewards [<i>apotropin</i>], a woman who does business from home,</b> where she manages the property of orphans, <b>and the member of the household</b> appointed to manage the household’s affairs.

            "<b>There are four</b> types of <b>bailees,</b> to whom different <i>halakhot</i> apply.

In the event that one of these bailees is unable to return the deposited item to its owner, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to liability is dependent upon what happened to the item, and upon the type of bailee: <b>An unpaid bailee takes an oath</b> attesting to the fact that he was not negligent with the care of the item and is then exempt from liability <b>for everything,</b> meaning for all types of damage, whether the item was lost, stolen, damaged, or if the animal died. Conversely, <b>a borrower</b> does not have the option of taking an oath, and <b>pays for everything,</b> whether the item was stolen, lost, damaged, or the animal died, even if it was by unavoidable accident. The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a paid bailee and a renter</b> are the same: They <b>take an oath concerning an injured</b> animal, <b>and concerning a captured</b> one, <b>and concerning a dead</b> animal, attesting to the fact that these mishaps were not caused by negligence, but rather by unavoidable accident, and then are exempt from liability. <b>But they must pay</b> if the deposit cannot be returned due to <b>loss or theft,</b> even if these were not caused by negligence.",
