Rebbi Shimon ben Yehudah said in the name of Rebbi Shimon [bar Yochai]: He is not liable until he writes a name [of idolatry] there.

Chananya ben Chachinai says: Also he may have been wearing [while plowing] a garment of mixed [wool and linen] fabrics (in violation of Leviticus 19:19 and Deuteronomy 22:11).  They said to him: This is not in the same category [as the other violations].  He said to them: Neither is the Nazirite in the same category [as the other violations]."
