            "There are <b>four primary categories of damage: The</b> category of <b>Ox; and the</b> category of <b>Pit; and the</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i>,</b> which, based on a discussion in the Gemara refers either to the tooth of an animal that causes damage or to a person who causes damage; <b>and the</b> category of <b>Fire.</b> Each of these categories is unique; therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of one cannot be derived from another. The defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i>, and</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i> is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox. And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> category of Ox <b>and that</b> category of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>in which there is a living spirit</b> that causes damage, <b>are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire, in which there is no living spirit.</b> The mishna continues: <b>And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> primary category of Ox and <i>Maveh</i> <b>and that</b> primary category of Fire, <b>in which</b> the <b>typical manner</b> of their components is <b>to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage, are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Pit, in which</b> the <b>typical manner</b> of its components is <b>not to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage;</b> rather, it remains in place and the damage is caused by the injured party proceeding and encountering the obstacle. <b>The common denominator of</b> the components in all of <b>these</b> primary categories is <b>that</b> it is <b>their typical manner to cause damage, and</b> the responsibility for <b>their safeguarding</b> to prevent them from causing damage is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> the owner of the animal or generator of the fire or the pit. <b>And when</b> a component of any of these categories <b>causes damage, the</b> owner or generator of the component that <b>caused</b> the <b>damage is obligated to pay</b> restitution <b>for damage with best</b>-quality <b>land.</b>",
            "With regard to <b>anything</b> for <b>which I became responsible for safeguarding it</b> to prevent it from causing damage, if it in fact causes damage, it is considered as if <b>I</b> actively <b>facilitated that damage,</b> and accordingly I must pay for it. In any case in which <b>I facilitated part of the damage it</b> caused, <b>I am liable for payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage it</b> caused, <b>as</b> if I were the <b>one who facilitated the entire damage it</b> caused. One is liable only with regard to damage caused to <b>property</b> for <b>which,</b> were he to use it for a non-sacred purpose, he <b>would not be</b> liable <b>for</b> the <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property; with regard to damage caused to <b>property that belongs to members of the covenant,</b> i.e., Jews; and with regard to <b>assigned property,</b> the meaning of which the Gemara will explain. <b>And</b> one is liable for damage caused <b>in any place except for a domain designated</b> exclusively <b>for</b> the use of <b>the one responsible for the damage.</b> <b>And</b> one is liable for damage caused in <b>a domain</b> designated for the joint use <b>of the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage.</b> <b>When</b> an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <b>causes damage, the one liable for the damage</b> caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <b>is obligated to pay payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage with</b> his best-quality <b>land.</b>",
            "The determination of payment of damages is made by <b>monetary appraisal.</b> One pays with items <b>worth money.</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>before a court. And</b> it is <b>based upon</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses</b> who are <b>free men,</b> i.e., men who are not Canaanite slaves, and who are <b>members of the covenant,</b> i.e., Jews. <b>And women are included in the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>damages</b> in the same way as men. <b>And</b> both <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage</b> are involved <b>in</b> the <b>payment.</b> The Gemara will explicate each of these principles.",
            "There are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts that an animal can perform twice and remain <b>innocuous</b> even when its owner was warned each time to prevent it from doing so. After the third time, the animal is rendered forewarned. In such cases, the owner is liable to pay only half of the damages. <b>And</b> there are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts for which an animal is considered <b>forewarned,</b> at times even if it had never caused damage in that manner. In such cases the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage. <b>An animal is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to Goring, i.e., <b>not for goring</b> with its horns, <b>nor for pushing</b> with its body, <b>nor for biting, nor for crouching</b> upon items in order to damage them, <b>nor for kicking.</b> In these cases the animal is considered to be innocuous and its owner is liable for only half of the damages. Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the tooth,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to eating that which is fitting for it</b> to eat. Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the foot,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to breaking</b> items <b>while walking. And</b> there is <b>a forewarned ox,</b> which gored three times and each time his owner was warned to safeguard his ox from doing so. <b>And</b> there is <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party. <b>And</b> there is <b>the person,</b> i.e., any damage done by a person. In all of these cases the one who caused the damage is considered to be forewarned, resulting in the obligation to pay the full cost of the damage. The mishna presents the <i>halakha</i> for wild animals: <b>The wolf; the lion; the bear; the leopard; the <i>bardelas</i>,</b> the meaning of which the Gemara will discuss; <b>and the snake. These are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> even if they had never previously caused damage. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: When these</b> animals <b>are domesticated they are not</b> considered <b>forewarned. But the snake is always</b> considered <b>forewarned.</b> <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the liability incurred for damage caused by an ox that is considered <b>innocuous and</b> the liability incurred for damage caused by an ox that is <b>forewarned?</b> The <b>only</b> differences are <b>that</b> for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox, the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> exclusively <b>from</b> proceeds of the sale <b>of the body</b> of the ox, <b>and</b> for <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>he pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage from</b> his <b>higher</b> property."
        ],
        [
            "The mishna in the previous chapter (15b) teaches that the owner of an animal is always forewarned with regard to the category of Trampling. The mishna elaborates: For <b>what</b> damage caused with <b>the hoof</b> is the animal deemed <b>forewarned?</b> It is deemed forewarned with regard <b>to</b> trampling objects and <b>breaking</b> them <b>in the course of its walking. An animal is</b> deemed <b>forewarned with regard to walking in its</b> typical <b>manner and,</b> by doing so, <b>breaking</b> objects as it proceeds. By contrast, if the animal <b>was kicking</b> while it was walking, <b>or</b> it transpired <b>that pebbles were</b> inadvertently <b>propelled from under its feet and</b> those pebbles <b>broke vessels,</b> cases of that kind do not fit precisely into the primary category of Trampling. In both of these cases the owner of the animal <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> If an animal <b>trod upon a vessel and broke it and</b> then a shard of that vessel <b>fell upon</b> a second <b>vessel and broke it,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the first</b> vessel, as its action is classified under the primary category of Trampling, <b>and he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the latter</b> vessel, as the damage caused by the shard is tantamount to damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled by the foot of an animal. <b>Chickens are</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to walking in their</b> typical <b>manner and breaking</b> objects, and therefore, the owner of a chicken pays the full restitution for the damage done to any objects broken by his chicken. If there <b>was a string [<i>delil</i>] tied to</b> a chicken’s <b>leg</b> as an indication of ownership and it wrapped around a vessel and broke it, <b>or</b> if the chicken <b>was hopping</b> in an atypical manner <b>and breaking vessels,</b> its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>",
            "Within the context of the primary category of Eating, for <b>what</b> damage caused with <b>the tooth</b> is an animal deemed <b>forewarned?</b> It is deemed forewarned with regard <b>to eating</b> food items <b>fit for its</b> consumption. <b>The domesticated animal is</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to eating fruits and vegetables.</b> If the animal <b>ate garments or vessels,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> As these are not items fit for its consumption, the animal is not deemed forewarned in this case. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> applied, that one pays the full value of the food eaten by the animal? It is a case where the animal ate the food <b>on the property of the injured</b> party; <b>but</b> if the animal ate food <b>in the public domain,</b> the owner of the animal is <b>exempt</b> from liability. <b>And</b> even if the animal ate food in the public domain, <b>if</b> the animal <b>derives benefit</b> from eating another’s produce in the public domain, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that it derives,</b> just not for the full cost of the food. <b>Under what</b> circumstances does the owner of the animal <b>pay</b> for <b>the benefit that it derives?</b> If the animal <b>ate</b> produce <b>in</b> the public <b>square</b> in the area before the storefronts, the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that it derives.</b> If the animal ate <b>from</b> food placed at <b>the side of</b> the public <b>square,</b> which is not a public thoroughfare, the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged,</b> as the legal status of that area is like that of the property of the injured party. If the animal ate produce <b>from the entrance of the store,</b> its owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that it derives,</b> as the status of a store entrance is like that of the public domain. If the animal ate produce <b>from inside the store,</b> its owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged.</b>",
            "With regard to <b>a dog or a goat that jumped from a rooftop and broke vessels</b> while doing so, their owners <b>must pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> to the vessels <b>because</b> these animals <b>are</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> concerning to jumping. With regard to <b>a dog that took a cake</b> that had been baked directly on hot coals, <b>and went to a stack</b> of grain to eat it, <b>and it ate the cake</b> and at the same time <b>ignited the stack</b> of grain with a coal that it had taken along with the cake, the owner of the dog must <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the cake, and</b> he must <b>pay for half</b> the cost of <b>the damage to the stack</b> of grain.",
            "<b>Which</b> type of ox <b>is</b> deemed <b>innocuous and which</b> is deemed <b>forewarned?</b> An ox is deemed <b>forewarned</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> witnesses <b>testified about it</b> that it gored on <b>three</b> different <b>days. And</b> it reverts back to its previous <b>innocuous</b> status <b>from when it reverses its</b> behavior and refrains from goring for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> It is deemed <b>forewarned</b> in any case <b>where</b> witnesses <b>testified</b> that <b>it</b> gored <b>three times,</b> regardless of the number of days on which this behavior occurred. <b>And</b> it reverts back to its previous <b>innocuous</b> status in <b>any</b> case <b>where children pet it</b> and play with it <b>and it does not gore</b> them.",
            "<b>And what is</b> the case of the <b>ox that causes damage</b> while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, mentioned in an earlier mishna (15b) that listed animals that are forewarned? If the animal <b>gored, pushed, bit, squatted</b> upon, or <b>kicked</b> another animal <b>in the public domain,</b> the owner is liable to <b>pay half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> if the ox was innocuous, but if it acted while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, <b>Rabbi Tarfon says:</b> He must pay the <b>full</b> cost of <b>the damage, and the Rabbis say:</b> He must pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> as in any other case classified as Goring. <b>Rabbi Tarfon said to the</b> Rabbis: <b>If in a place where</b> the Torah <b>was lenient with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Eating and with regard to Trampling,</b> specifically <b>in the public domain, as</b> the owner <b>is exempt</b> from liability, nevertheless the Torah was <b>strict with regard to these</b> forms of damage if they occurred <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, requiring him <b>to pay</b> the <b>full</b> cost of <b>the damage,</b> then in <b>a place where</b> the Torah <b>was strict with regard to</b> cases of damage classified as <b>Goring,</b> specifically <b>in the public domain,</b> requiring the owner liable <b>to pay for half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, is it not right that we</b> should <b>be strict with regard to this</b> form of damage if it occurs <b>on the property of the injured</b> party to likewise require the owner of the animal <b>to pay</b> the <b>full</b> cost of <b>the damage?</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Although there is an <i>a fortiori</i> inference being applied here, still <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source,</b> meaning that the <i>halakha</i> cannot be stricter with the inference than it is with the case that serves as the source of the inference. Therefore, <b>just as</b> one is liable to pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> classified as Goring <b>in the public domain, so too,</b> for damage classified as Goring <b>on the property of the injured</b> party he is liable to pay only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to them:</b> If that is your opinion, then <b>I as well</b> <b>will not derive an inference</b> with regard to <b>Goring from</b> a different case of <b>Goring. I will</b> instead <b>derive an inference</b> with regard to <b>Goring from Trampling: And if in a place where</b> the Torah <b>was lenient with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> specifically <b>in the public domain,</b> as the owner is exempt from liability, nevertheless the Torah was <b>strict with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Goring,</b> requiring him to pay half the cost of the damage, then in <b>a place where</b> the Torah <b>was strict with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> specifically <b>on the property of the injured</b> party as the animal’s owner is obligated to pay the full cost of the damage, <b>is it not right that we</b> should <b>be</b> equally <b>strict with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Goring</b> and require payment of the full cost of the damage in this case as well? The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Here as well, <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source,</b> and therefore, <b>just as</b> one is liable to pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> classified as Goring <b>in the public domain, so too,</b> for damage classified as Goring <b>on the property of the injured</b> party he will be liable to pay only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> as ultimately your inference still depends on the fact that for Goring in the public domain one pays half the cost of the damage.",
            "The legal status of <b>a person</b> is <b>always</b> that of one <b>forewarned.</b> Therefore, <b>whether</b> the damage was <b>unintentional or intentional, whether</b> he was <b>awake</b> while he caused the damage <b>or asleep,</b> whether <b>he blinded another’s eye or broke vessels, he must pay the full</b> cost of <b>the damage.</b>"

            "In the case of <b>one who places a <i>kad</i>,</b> a type of vessel, <b>in the public domain and another</b> person <b>comes and stumbles on it and breaks it,</b> the other person is <b>exempt</b> from paying for what he broke. <b>And if</b> the one who stumbled <b>incurred damaged by</b> it, <b>the owner of the <i>ḥavit</i>,</b> a type of vessel, <b>is liable</b> to pay restitution <b>for his damage.</b> If one’s <b>jug broke in the public domain and</b> another person <b>slipped in the water</b> from the jug and was injured from the fall, <b>or</b> if he <b>was injured by the shards</b> of the broken jug, the owner of the jug is <b>liable.

            "<b>One who injures another is liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for that</b> injury <b>due to five types</b> of indemnity: He must pay <b>for damage, for pain, for medical costs, for loss of livelihood, and</b> for <b>humiliation.</b> <b>How</b> is payment <b>for damage</b> assessed? If <b>one blinded</b> another’s <b>eye, severed his hand, broke his leg,</b> or caused any other injury, the court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a slave</b> being <b>sold in the</b> slave <b>market, and</b> the court <b>appraises how much he was worth</b> before the injury <b>and how much he is worth</b> after the injury. The difference between these two sums is the amount that one must pay for causing damage. How is payment for <b>pain</b> assessed? If <b>one burned</b> another <b>with a skewer [<i>beshapud</i>] or with</b> a hot <b>nail, or even</b> if one burned another <b>on his fingernail,</b> which is <b>a place where he does not cause a bruise</b> that would affect the victim’s value on the slave market, the court <b>evaluates how much</b> money <b>a person</b> with <b>a similar</b> threshold for pain <b>as</b> the victim <b>is willing to take</b> in order to be made <b>to suffer in this way.</b> The one who burned the victim must then pay this amount. How is payment for <b>medical costs</b> assessed? If one <b>struck</b> another, then he is <b>liable to heal him</b> by paying for his medical costs. In a case where <b>growths,</b> e.g., blisters or rashes, <b>appeared on</b> the injured party, <b>if</b> the growths are <b>due to the blow,</b> the one who struck him is <b>liable;</b> if the growths are <b>not due to the blow,</b> the one who struck him is <b>exempt.</b> In a case where the wound <b>healed, and</b> then <b>reopened,</b> and again <b>healed, and</b> then <b>reopened,</b> the one who struck him remains <b>liable to heal</b> the injured party by paying for his medical costs, as it is apparent that the current wound resulted from the original injury. If the injury <b>healed fully,</b> the one who struck him <b>is not liable to heal him</b> by paying for any subsequent medical costs. How is payment for <b>loss of livelihood</b> assessed? The court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a watchman of cucumbers,</b> and the one who caused him injury must compensate him based on that pay scale for the income that he lost during his convalescence. This indemnity does not take into account the value of the standard wages of the injured party <b>because</b> the one who caused him injury <b>already gave him compensation for his hand or compensation for his leg,</b> and that compensation took into account his professional skills. How is payment for <b>humiliation</b> assessed? <b>It all depends on</b> the stature of <b>the one who humiliates</b> the other <b>and the one who is humiliated.</b> <b>One who humiliates a naked person,</b> or <b>one who humiliates a blind person, or one who humiliates a sleeping person</b> is <b>liable, but a sleeping person who humiliates</b> another is <b>exempt.</b> If one <b>fell from the roof</b> onto another person, <b>and</b> thereby <b>caused</b> him <b>damage and humiliated</b> him, then the one who fell is <b>liable for the</b> indemnity of <b>damage,</b> since a person is always considered forewarned, <b>and exempt from the</b> indemnity of <b>humiliation, as it is stated: “and putting out her hand, she takes hold of his private parts”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11); a person is not liable for humiliation <b>unless he intends</b> to humiliate the other person.",
