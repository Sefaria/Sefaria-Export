            "\tBeth Shammai says: \"All women — their time is sufficient.\" [All women who see blood, their time is sufficient to render unclean levitically clean food (taharoth) which they had touched, from the time of sighting (blood) and thenceforward. And we do not say that there was also blood before them, but the walls of the woman had prevented it from coming out, and that she was unclean even before her sighting. For all women render taharoth unclean (when they find blood) in the outer orifice, even though the blood has not come out. The reason that Shammai is not concerned that blood may have been there before her examination is that one would always be worried during intercourse that blood had issued forth and he would separate from his wife, thereby keeping the daughters of Israel from having children.] Hillel says: \"From examination to examination, even for many days.\" [i.e., If she examined herself today and found herself clean and examined herself again at the end of the week and found herself unclean, we are concerned about what she had touched from the first examination on. Perhaps with the withdrawal of her hands (from the first examination) blood had appeared and had been prevented from coming out by the walls of the womb. And we are not concerned about suspension of cohabitation. For it is only in resepct to taharoth that we render (them) unclean from one examination to the next. But (we do) not (render her unclean) in respect to (cohabitation with) her husband. And Shammai holds that if you render her unclean in respect to taharoth, he will be uneasy and will also separate from intercourse.] And the sages say: \"Neither like the one nor like the other.\" [Neither like Shammai, who is too lenient and does not make a fence for his words; nor like Hillel, who is overly stringent. For the womb does not hold in the blood for so long a period of time.] But \"me'eth le'eth\" [i.e., twenty-four hours] (sometimes) shortens al yad (i.e., after) \"examination to examination,\" and \"examination to examination\" (sometimes) shortens al yad \"me'eth le'eth\" [i.e., Two time periods are mentioned in respect to a woman relative to rendering taharoth unclean retroactively, and the more lenient option is followed in both instances. That is, if \"examination to examination\" is longer than \"me'eth le'eth,\" \"me'eth le'eth\" is followed and only the taharoth that she touched at this time yesterday are rendered unclean. And if \"me'eth le'eth\" is longer than \"examination to examination,\" as when she examined herself in the morning and found herself clean, and in the evening and found herself unclean, only those taharoth from the first examination to the second are rendered unclean. And the halachah is in accordance with the sages. (\"al yad\" here is to be understood as \"after,\" as in Nechemiah 3:8, 10, 12)]. Every woman who has a [regular] period, [established by three sightings; and she examined herself at her expected time and found herself unclean], her [expected] time is sufficient [and we do not fear that her flow had come before her time, for, certainly, the \"guest\" comes on time.] And if one uses cloths, this is considered an examination. [We are taught two things here, viz.: It is a mitzvah for every woman to use two examination cloths for intercourse, one before and one after. \"This (the second cloth) is considered an examination,\" viz.] It \"shortens\" through \"me'eth le'eth\" or \"examination to examination\" (respectively). [For I might think that there might have been a drop of blood the size of a mustard-seed, which had been covered by semen, so that this would not constitute an examination; the Mishnah, therefore, apprises us that the ed (cloth) after intercourse is considered an examination. But the ed before intercourse is not considered an examination. For, in her haste for cohabitation, she may not be careful to insert the ed into all the crevices].",
            "\tShammai says: \"From a kav, for challah\" [i.e., a kav of dough is subject to challah (the Cohein's share of the dough)]. Hillel says: \"From two kavim.\" And the sages say: \"Neither like the one nor like the other; but a kav and a half are subject to challah.\" [\"a kav and a half\" — seven logs, an egg, and a fifth of an egg by the measure of the desert, this being the omer for a head\" (Exodus 16:16), half of an ephah, which is subject to challah, as it is written (Numbers 15:20): \"The first of your dough, challah, etc.\" according to the dough of the desert.\" And they added a sixth in Yerushalmiyoth. It is found, then, that six desert logs are contained in five Yerushalmiyoth; and the remaining log, and an egg, and a fifth of an egg add up to a Yerushalmi log. For the desert log was six eggs. Place them in five big eggs and you find that the log is lacking a big egg. Give an egg and a fifth for the big egg, the fifth of the egg being a sixth in addition to the egg, we find six big eggs, which are a big log, so that (altogether) we find six big logs — a kav and a half (which are subject to challah.)] And when the sizes were enlarged [to the Sepphoris standard, a sixth more than the Yerushalmith, so that the six logs became five, which are five quarters of a kav, a kav being four logs,] they said: \"Five quarters of a kav are subject (to challah\"). R. Yossi says: \"Five (quarters) are exempt (from challah), five and above are subject to it.\" [R. Yossi holds that the desert measure was (eggs) larger than ours, one-twentieth of an egg for each egg. And the halachah is in accordance with the sages, that the shiur (the minimum measurement) for challah is a Yerushalmith kav and a half; that is, six Yerushalmith logs, which, by the desert standard, are seven logs, and an egg and a fifth of an egg — altogether, forty-three eggs and a fifth of an egg. And the Rambam weighed and searched and adjusted and examined and found that the weight of five hundred and twenty derahams of wheat flour is the shiur of flour subject to challah. And the deraham weight is known in Egypt today and in Eretz Yisrael to be the weight of about sixty-one barley grains.]",
            "\tHillel says a whole hin [twelve logs] of drawn water invalidates a mikveh [if they fall into it before its shiur (its minimum amount of non-drawn water) has been completed. But after it has been completed, even if he threw into it all the drawn water in the world, it is not invalidated.] One must use the terminology of his teacher [i.e., \"hin\" is not Mishnah terminology but Torah terminology. But this is what he heard from his teachers, Shemayah and Avtalyon. And the Rambam received it from his father, of blessed memory, that Shemayah and Avtalyon, being righteous converts (gerei tzedek) could not pronounce \"hin\" and said \"in\" instead, (like [many] people today, who cannot enunciate aleph, cheth, heh, and ayin), so that Hillel also said \"in,\" as his teachers, the gerei tzedek, Shemayah and Avtalyon did.] Shammai says nine kavin. And the sages say: Neither like the one nor like the other; but until there came two weavers from the Dung Gate in Jerusalem and testified in the name of Shemayah and Avtalyon that three logs of drawn water invalidate the mikveh, and the sages substantiated their words. [\"the Dung Gate\": The Tanna mentioned their occupation and their locality to teach that one should not keep himself from the house of study. For there is no trade more menial than that of a weaver, who is not appointed a king or a high-priest. And there is no gate in Jerusalem inferior to the Dung Gate, and yet, they outweighed in their testimony all the sages of Israel.]",
            "\tAnd why are the words of Shammai and Hillel mentioned in vain? To teach future generations that one should not stand fast upon his words, [i.e., that he should not be intransigent in his opinion]; for \"the fathers of the world\" [Hillel and Shammai] did not stand fast upon their words.",
            "\tAnd why do we mention the words of the one, among the many, if the halachah is only in accordance with the many? So that if beth-din holds with the view of the one, and relies upon it [against the view of the many], a [future] beth-din cannot annul the words of its fellow beth-din unless it be greater in wisdom than that of the first], and in number [i.e., that the number of disciples in the second be greater than the number of disciples in the first.] If it were greater in wisdom but not in number, or in number but not in wisdom, it cannot annul its words unless it be greater (than the first) both in wisdom and in number.",
            "\tR. Yehudah said: If so, why do we mention in vain the words of the individual, [in accordance with whose view no beth-din has acted], among the many? So that if a man say [in wonderment, when he sees that he is not being upheld by beth-din]: \"But so have I received it,\" they can say to him: \"You have received it according to this and this man's view,\" [but it has been rejected.]",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: A quarter [of a kav] of the bones [of the dead], whether from two or three, [cause tent-uncleanliness. And fewer than a quarter cause uncleanliness only by touching or carrying, but not in a tent. And Beth Shammai hold that a quarter of a kav cause tumah (uncleanliness) even if they are from many dead.] And Beth Hillel say: A quarter (of a kav) of the bones of the body. [That is, from the body of one dead man and not from many dead. And, even from one dead man, there is no tumah unless there be in the quarter of a kav either] the majority of the built [i.e., the majority of the built of the body] or the majority of the number [of the bones of a man — one hundred and twenty-five, a man's bones numbering two hundred and forty-eight.] Beth Shammai say: Even one bone. [i.e., If one bone of the dead man fills a quarter of a kav, it causes tent-uncleanliness. The halachah is in accordance with Beth Hillel.]",
            "\tKarshinim (vetch) of terumah — [In Arabic they are called \"karshena.\" They are camel feed, and are used for human consumption only in a famine year. Terumah is separated from them, since men sometimes eat them, when forced to do so. And they are not sanctified, as other terumoth are] — Beth Shammai say: They are soaked [in water] and rubbed [on one's skin] in cleanliness [i.e., after cleansing one's hands, (netilath yadayim), according to the din of all other terumah food. For hands have the status of second-degree uncleanliness, and invalidate terumah]; and they are fed [to animals] in uncleanliness, [there being no concern about his making them unclean with his hands when feeding them to animals. But when they are not fed to animals, it is forbidden to render them unclean by the hands.] Beth Hillel say: They are soaked, in cleanliness, [for soaking them in water renders them susceptible to acquiring uncleanliness; and if he soaks them in uncleanliness, their tumah and their susceptibility come together. And this alone is what Beth Hillel forbid, as a sign, so that it be known that they are terumah], and they are rubbed (on the skin) and fed (to animals) in uncleanliness. Shammai says: Let them be eaten tzarid, [\"dry,\" as in \"tzarid of menachoth,\" there being a place in the meal-offerings where the oil did not reach. Here, too, let them be eaten dry, so there not be liquid upon them when they are eaten, so that it not be recognized that they were made susceptible of acquiring uncleanliness.] R. Akiva says: All that is done with them [even soaking] may be done in uncleanliness. [The halachah is in accordance with Beth Hillel.]",
            "\tOne who exchanges a sela-worth of second-tithe money [i.e., one who has copper coins of second-tithe (ma'aser sheni) money, and he comes to exchange them for a silver sela to take up to Jerusalem because of the burden of the way] — Beth Shammai say: For the whole sela, coins. [i.e., If he comes to exchange them, he exchanges all of them, and he gives (copper) coins for the whole sela.] And Beth Hillel say: (He should take with him) a shekel [half a sela] in silver, and a shekel in (copper) coins. [For when he comes to Jerusalem, he will need coins immediately to buy what he needs to eat; and if all run to the money changer to change (a whole sela for copper coins), the coins will become dear and ma'aser sheni will suffer a loss. Therefore, they should take (copper) coins with them for their immediate needs, and, when they give out, he should exchange the silver that he has, little by little.] R. Meir says: Silver and fruits are not to be redeemed for silver [i.e., if one has half a silver dinar of second-tithe money and second-tithe fruits worth half a dinar, he should not combine them to redeem them for a dinar.] And the sages permit it [in such an instance, by combining it with fruits, since he has only half a dinar of silver. But to redeem a silver dinar and fruits worth a dinar for half a sela, which is worth two dinars — the sages agree that this is not to be done. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tOne who exchanges a sela of second-tithe money in Jerusalem [i.e., if he exchanged a sela that he had for copper coins to expend them for the needs of a second-tithe meal — Beth Shammai say: For the whole sela, coins [i.e., if he wishes to exchange all the selaim that he has for coins, he may do so.] And Beth Hillel say: A shekel in silver and a shekel in coins. [i.e., he should exchange only half, lest he not remain in the city until he has spent all of them and he deposit them in the city until the next holiday and the coins deteriorate. And if he re-exchanges them for selaim, the money changer will profit twice, and ma'aser sheni will lose.] Those who deliberate in the presence of the sages, [i.e., Shimon b. Azzai, Shimon b. Zoma and Chanan Hamitzri] say: For three dinars, silver, and for one dinar, coins. [i.e., he should take coins only for one dinar, and three silver dinarim should remain.] R. Akiva says: For three dinars, silver; and for the fourth, a quarter in coins. [i.e., For the fourth silver dinar, he should take only a fourth in copper coins, and three-quarters, silver, so that he ends up with one-sixteenth of a sela in copper coins alone.] R. Tarfon says: Four esperi, silver. [A silver dinar equals five esperi (a Greek coin, which is still called by the same name), so that a sela equals twenty esperi. Therefore, in exchange for a dinar, he receives four silver esperi and one espero of copper (coins), and he ends up with one-twentieth of a sela in copper coins alone.] Shammai says: Let him leave it in the shop and eat in accordance with it. [i.e., He should not exchange it for coins at all, lest he forget and render them chullin (i.e., non-sanctified); but let him leave the sela with the shopkeeper and eat corresponding to its worth, until it is used up. The halachah is in accordance with Beth Hillel alone.]",
            "\tA bridal chair whose chipuyim were removed — Beth Shammai rule it unclean (if sat upon by a zav), and Beth Hillel rule it clean. [(\"whose chipuyim were removed\":) Our rabbis understand \"chipuyim\" as in \"chafei pothachath\" (Shabbath 81a), which are teeth (i.e., projections) protruding from keys that they make in the Arab lands. Here, too, they make projections on the bridal chair on which to lean. The Rambam understands it as carvings and figures made of wood or stone affixed upon the bridal chair. \"Beth Shammai rule it unclean\" (tamei): for it is still fit for sitting. \"And Beth Hillel rule it clean\" (tahor): for it is unfit for a bride and considered broken.] Shammai says: Even the frame (malbein) of the chair is tamei. [That is, even the frame itself without the seat is tamei; how much more so the seat itself without its appurtenances. (\"malbein\":) the form of a square brick made upon the seat, on which one sits.] A seat affixed to a kneading trough [If one brought a seat from a different place and affixed it to a kneading trough to be sat upon (and a kneading trough itself is not rendered tamei if sat upon, for it is made for kneading and not for sitting)] — Beth Shammai rule it tamei, [for the seat is not \"neutralized\" (batel) by the kneading trough.] And Beth Hillel rule it tahor [if sat upon, for the seat is neutralized by the kneading trough. (But if the seat is built into the kneading trough itself, both Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel agree that it is tahor)]. Shammai says: Even if it were built into it [i.e., even if the seat were built into the kneading trough itself, it is tamei if sat upon by a zav.]",
            "\tThese are the cases where Beth Hillel reversed (their ruling) to teach in accordance with Beth Shammai: If a woman came from abroad and said: \"My husband died,\" she may remarry; \"my husband died,\" she may perform levirate marriage. And Beth Hillel say: We did not hear (that she is permitted to remarry) except when she came from the wheat harvest) [as in the event that occurred, where men went to harvest wheat, and a snake bit and killed one of them, and his wife came and apprised beth-din of it, whereupon they sent and found her account to be correct. And they permitted it only in like circumstances; but she was not believed (to testify) about what had happened abroad.] (At this,) Beth Shammai said to them: (She may remarry) whether she came from the wheat harvest or the olive harvest, and from abroad. The sages stated \"wheat harvest\" only in that this happened to be the case, [but the same applies to all places] — whereupon Beth Hillel retracted (their ruling) to rule according to Beth Shammai. Beth Shammai say: She marries and she takes her kethubah (payment). Beth Hillel say: She marries, but does not take her kethubah — whereupon Beth Shammai said to them: You permitted an ervah (i.e., remarrying), which is more stringent, and you did not permit money, which is less stringent! Beth Hillel answered: We have found that her brothers do not enter the inheritance [of her husband] by her testimony, [it being written (Deuteronomy 19:15): \"By word of two witnesses, etc.\", but vis-à-vis her marrying, the rabbis were lenient, so that she not remain an agunah.] Beth Shammai responded: But should we not learn (the ruling) from the scroll of her kethubah [i.e., from the formula of the kethubah deed], where he writes to her: \"If you marry another, take what is written (over) to you\" [and she did remarry, wherefore she should take her kethubah (payment)!] — whereupon Beth Hillel retracted (their ruling) to rule according to Beth Shammai.",
            "\tIf one were half-slave, half-free, [as the slave of two partners, who was freed by one of them, or as one whose master received from him half of his (redemption) money, by which half of him was freed], he serves his master one day and himself another day. These are the words of Beth Hillel. Beth Shammai said to them: You have aided his master, [who loses nothing], but you have not aided him! He cannot marry a maidservant, [because of the part of him that is free], and he cannot (marry) a free woman, [because of the part of him that is slave]. Shall he abstain (from marriage)? Was the world not created for having children? viz. (Isaiah 5:18): \"Not for naught did He create it; to be settled did He form it!\" But, for the world's amendment (tikkun haolam), we force his master to free him, and he writes (his master) a note (of indebtedness) for half his worth. [(The same applies if he were the slave of a hundred partners; all of them are forced to free him)] — whereupon Beth Hillel retracted, to rule in accordance with Beth Shammai.",
            "\tAn earthenware vessel [whose cover is (completely) fastened upon it] protects all that is in it (from tent-uncleanliness) according to Beth Hillel, [it being written (Numbers 19:15): \"And every open vessel whose cover is not fastened upon it is unclean.\" But if its cover is fastened upon it, it and what is in it, whether vessels or food and drink, is clean. And the verse speaks of an earthenware vessel, it being written: \"And every open vessel,\" connoting a vessel that contracts tumah through its opening and not through its back (i.e., an earthenware vessel).] And Beth Shammai say: It protects only food and drink and earthenware vessels (that are in it), [but not other vessels]. Beth Hillel asked them: Why? Beth Shammai answered: Because it (the earthenware vessel containing them) is tamei through an am ha'aretz (ignoramus) [For everything found with an am ha'aretz, both vessels and food and drink, are all in a status of tamei, because they are not versed in the halachoth of tumah and taharah, and think that what is tamei is tahor], and an unclean vessel does not intervene [i.e., it does not protect against tumah, but only a clean vessel does. An unclean vessel does not protect what is in it (from tent-uncleanliness). And the vessels of an am ha'aretz, since they are in a status of tamei, do not protect.] (At this,) Beth Hillel asked them: But did you not rule \"tahor\" the food and drink in it? Beth Shammai answered: When we ruled the food and drink in it \"tahor,\" we did so for him, [the am ha'aretz himself. And we have no fear that a Torah scholar will come to use them, for they separate themselves from them. And even without this, all of their food is tamei. Therefore, as to food and drink and earthenware vessels, which cannot be purified in a mikveh, which were in the vessel of an am ha'aretz, whose cover was (completely) fastened — we tell them that they are tahor. And we have no fear that a Torah scholar will borrow from them and use them, for they are in the status of tamei to them and can never be made tahor. But with vessels that can be immersed (in a mikveh), we fear that a Torah scholar may borrow from them and use them without haza'ah (sprinkling the purification waters) on them the third and seventh days, not knowing that they had become tamei in a tent of the dead and thinking that immersion (in a mikveh) itself is sufficient for them, to free them of their tumah that they had contracted through the am ha'aretz], but when you (Beth Hillel) ruled the vessel \"tahor,\" you did so for you and for him. [For a Torah scholar might come to use it. Therefore, they (Beth Shammai) ruled the same for all, that a vessel that could be immersed is not protected by a sealed covering, neither for a Torah scholar nor for an am ha'aretz. If they came to decree that the earthenware vessel of an am ha'aretz never \"protects\" (even) with a fastened cover, because it is in the status of tamei, the amei ha'aretz would never accept this, thinking that they are expert (in these laws) and that they keep their vessels tahor, and that their vessels \"protect.\"] And Beth Hillel retracted, to rule in accordance with Beth Shammai."

            "\tR. Chanina, the adjutant high-priest, testified as to four things: In all the days of the Cohanim they did not refrain from burning flesh that had become tamei through the \"offspring\" (velad) of tumah together with flesh that had become tamei through an av hatumah (proto[\"father\"]-tumah,) even though they thereby added tumah to its tumah. [(\"offspring\":) velad of velad is meant, i.e., flesh of third-degree tumah, having become tamei through a velad of a velad, having touched second-degree tumah and become third-degree tumah. They did not refrain from burning it together with flesh that had become tamei through an av hatumah (and had thus become first-degree tumah). And when this flesh, which in the beginning had been third-degree tumah, touches the flesh which had touched the av hatumah, it becomes second-degree tumah, having touched first-degree tumah. It is found, then, that tumah has been added to its tumah, it first having been third-degree, and now being second-degree — in spite of which they did not refrain from burning it together with a higher degree of tumah. For since this lesser degree is also to be burnt they were not concerned if it thereby became a higher degree of tumah. And even though, according to the Torah, food does not render other foods tamei¸ it being written in this regard: \"It is tamei\" — it is tamei, but it does not render tamei food like it — still, the Rabbis decreed that food does render other food unclean.]",
            "\tR. Chanina, the adjutant high-priest, testified: In all of my days I never saw the hide (of a bechor [a first-born animal]) going out to the burning site [after it had been flayed, if it were found to be treifah, even though the p'sul (the disqualifying factor) were in it before the flaying — since it was not recognized until after the flaying]. R. Akiva said: From his words we learn that if one flays a bechor and it is found to be a treifah, the Cohanim may enjoy its hide, and it is not burned. [R. Akiva comes to let us hear that even a blemished bechor, which is slaughtered outside of the sanctuary because of its blemish, the Torah (not having allowed it to be sacrificed but) only to be eaten, it being written (Deuteronomy 15:21): \"In your gates (i.e., outside of the sanctuary) shall you eat it\" — if it died, its hide is forbidden and it requires burial. And R. Akiva apprised us that when its being a treifah is not recognized until after it is flayed, its shechitah and its flaying permits its hide as if its blood had been sprinkled in the sanctuary.] The sages say: \"We have not seen\" is no proof [i.e., perhaps it never happened in his days that it was found to be treifah after flaying, and if it happened and they burned it, he did not see it]; but it goes out to the burning site.",

[i.e., If a tevul yom touches the egg, even though it is chullin (i.e., non-terumah), terumah not obtaining with an egg, and a tevul yom not invalidating chullin, still it is considered \"chibbur\" (a connection of the egg with the green) and the green is invalidated as if he had touched it.] And if it were like a dome [i.e., If the egg had \"swollen\" and become like a dome over the green (nothing intervening between it and the green)], it is not chibbur.",

[For it is \"a labor that is not needed for its own sake\", (the labor being the opening.)

Yishmael says: [since he has weighted and crushed them before Sabbath,] he may finish [and eat them] after dark, [on the Sabbath. And these are not like juices that flowed (from fruits), which are forbidden (to be eaten on the Sabbath) lest he come to squeeze (the fruit). For here, even if he does squeeze it, he does not transgress a Torah issur, since the juice flows out, of itself.] And R. Akiva sys: He may not finish, [in order to eat it after he sanctified the day, for they are forbidden like all juices that have flowed out (of fruits). The halachah is in accordance with R.

(He said) about the shoe of those who work in lime [(The lime workers wore wooden shoes to protect their feet from being burnt by the lime)], that it (the shoe) contracts midras (\"treading\"-) uncleanliness [if worn by a zav]. And (he said) about what was left of an oven [that was very large and became tamei and was afterwards broken, that it does not become tahor unless what was left over was less than] four [(tefachim) in height. (An \"oven\" in the Mishnah was made like a big pot without a bottom, connected with clay to the ground, which was its \"bottom.\")] For they (the sages) (originally) had said (\"less than) three,\" and (now) they concurred with him.",

Because the nature of the son is likely to be similar to that of the father, from the beginning of his creation he is endowed with beauty, strength, wisdom, and years; and wealth is bequeathed him by his father. To me, the Mishnah seems to mean that if a man merits it, his sons come to acquire all of these things], and (he endows him) with the number of generations before him. [Sometimes, the Holy One Blessed be He assures the father that He will grant some favor to his children in the third or fourth generation, and it is the father's merit that secures that favor for his children]; and that is the \"ketz\" (\"ending\").

The judgment of the wicked in Gehinnom — twelve months, viz.

If one touches or carried two half-olive sizes of neveilah (carrion) [(He opens with \"tent-\" (uncleanliness) and explains \"neveilah,\" to teach that just as R.

Dossa holds that even in \"compressed tumah\" they do not combine.)], or if he touches a half-olive size, and a half-olive size tents over him; or if he tents over two half-olive sizes, tenting over a half-olive size, and a half-olive size tenting over him — R.

Meir) saying that even in such an instance the sages disagree with R. Dossa, holding that \"touching\" and \"tent\" are one name, wherefore they combine to make the (required) minimum size (for tumah), and they rule tamei. (The halachah is not in accordance with R. Meir)]. Everything is tamei, except \"touching\" with \"moving,\" [as when he \"touched\" a half-olive size and \"moved\" (heset) a half-olive size], and \"carrying\" with \"tent\", [as when he moved a half-olive size and tented over a half-olive size.] This is the rule: Everything which is of \"one name\" [as in \"touching\" with \"touching,\" \"moving\" with \"moving,\" \"tent\" with \"tent\"] is tamei; of two names, tahor.",

            "\tIn three things R. Gamliel takes the stringent view, according to the words of Beth Shammai: Hot foods are not stored from Yom Tov to Shabbath. [Beth Shammai hold that one may not bake (from Yom Tov to Shabbath) unless he has made an eruv tavshilin with a loaf. And he may not cook unless he has made an eruv tavshilin with something cooked. And he may not store food (for warmth) unless he had stored something from the eve of Yom Tov). And Beth Hillel hold that one may bake and cook and store on an eruv of cooked food alone], and a menorah is not assembled on Yom Tov [i.e., a menorah whose parts have been disassembled may not be restored, this being like \"building,\" which obtains with vessels. And Beth Hillel hold that \"building\" does not obtain with vessels], and thick loaves are not baked (on Yom Tov), but only thin ones. [Beth Shammai hold that much bread is not baked on Yom Tov because of \"exertion.\" And Beth Hillel say that it is baked, for when there is more bread it bakes better.] R. Gamliel said: From the days of Beth Shammai they did not bake thick loaves but only thin ones. They said to him: What shall we do for your father's house, who were stringent with themselves and lenient with Israel, allowing them to bake thick breads and chari? [(ample dough baked over coals.) The halachah is not in accordance with R. Gamliel in all of his stringencies according to the words of Beth Shammai.]",
            "\tHe (R. Gamliel) also stated three leniencies: It is permitted (on Yom Tov) to sweep between the beds [on which they used to recline to eat], and mugmar (frankincense) may be placed [on coals, to be inhaled] on Yom Tov. [But all hold that it is forbidden to do so to \"scent\" the vessels], and it is permitted to eat a \"helmeted\" (mekulass) goat on Pesach night. [Its legs and innards hung at its side when they roasted it. They would do this as a remembrance of the Pesach offering, in respect to which it is written (Exodus 12:9): \"its head with its legs with its innards.\" (\"mekulas\":) like a warrior, whose weapons are at his side. The targum of \"a copper helmet\" is \"kulsa denachsha.\"] And the sages forbid [all three: sweeping, because of the making of holes; mugmar, because it is not needed by all, but only by the very delicate or those with body odor; a \"helmeted\" goat, because it gives the impression of consecrated food being eaten outside (the sanctuary). The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tThree things were permitted by R. Elazar b. Azaryah and forbidden by the sages: His cow went out (into the public domain on Shabbath) with the strap between her horns [for adornment. And the sages said that it is a \"burden\" and not \"adornment\" to her. (It was not the cow of R. Elazar b. Azaryah, but that of his neighbor, but because he did not protest, it was called by his name.)], and a beast may be curried on Yom Tov [with a kind of iron comb with small teeth. One may comb and scratch a beast with it even though he thereby makes a sore], and he may crush peppers with their [small] mills [made for this purpose]. R. Yehudah says: A beast is not curried on Yom Tov because he thereby makes a sore; but he may scrape [it with a wooden comb, whose teeth are large and do not make a sore.] And the sages say: They are not curried and also not scraped, scraping being decreed against because of currying. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Elazar b. Azaryah, except in the instance of currying a beast alone; for in this he follows the view of R. Shimon, who says that something not intended (like making a sore, in this instance) is permitted, and we rule according to him. And the sages who differ with him hold with R. Yehudah, who says that something not intended is forbidden, and this is not the halachah.]"

Beth Hillel says that it may not be eaten, for every egg that is hatched today is completed the day before, so that Shabbath is found to have \"prepared\" for Yom Tov.

Another interpretation: Beth Shammai say that it is not shikchah even with a sheaf that he did no take hold of at all. For since he placed it next to a particular object, he will come to remember it; and Beth Hillel say that it is shikchah, so long as he did not take hold of it.

Which is \"an old get\"? A get, after the writing of which he continued living with her. [The halachah: One may not divorce his wife with an old get. And if he divorced her and went to a different country, she may remarry by it ab initio.] If one divorced his wife, and she spent the night with him at an inn, [there being witnesses to their having been alone together, but not to their having cohabited], Beth Shammai say: She does not require a second get from him.

[For ma'amar is not sufficient to give her (the first) the status of a married woman, and the other (the second) is forbidden by reason of \"the sister of his linked one.\" A get is necessary because of the ma'amar, which is partial betrothal (and betrothal is not dissolved without a get.) and she also requires chalitzah, for since the ma'amar is not bona fide betrothal, she is still linked to him (for yibum) and requires chalitzah to dissolve that linkage; so that first he gives her a get, and then chalitzah.] and this is the instance of which they said (13:7): \"Woe to him by reason of his wife, [whom he must divorce], and woe to him by reason of his brother's wife!\" [whom he must give chalitzah]",

[For thus do we find with respect to a niddah, that she is unclean for seven days; and we derive what is common (a man's becoming angry with his wife and forbidding her by vow) from what is common (niddah, which is a common occurrence) — as opposed to childbirth, which is not that common. And Beth Shammai hold that we derive something which he causes (the vow of the man, which causes her to desist), from something that he causes (childbirth, which comes through him) — as opposed to niddah, which comes of itself. If (he forbids her) more than one week according to Beth Hillel, or more than two weeks according to Beth Shammai, he must send her away and give her her kethubah — even if he were a camel driver, whose conjugal time is once in thirty days, or a mariner, whose conjugal time is once in six months.] If a woman miscarried on the eve of the eighty-first day [of her having given birth to a female, in which instance she brings an offering of atonement on the eighty-first day (for the first birth)], Beth Shammai exempt her from an offering [for the second (miscarried) birth, even though it took place after the \"consummation\" (of her days of purification [viz. Leviticus 12:6]) since it took place at night, when an offering may not be brought, it being written (Ibid. 7:38): \"…on the day that He commanded… to present their offerings,\" wherefore, in respect to the offering, it (the eighty-first day) is considered the day of \"consummation.\"] And Beth Hillel rule it liable (for a second offering) [since she miscarried after the time of \"consummation.\"] A (linen) night-garment with tzitzith, [(which contain a cord of tcheleth, (wool dyed in the (purple) blood of a chilazon)] is kilayim (a forbidden admixture [wool and linen]).

As in an instance of a bahereth with a white hair in it. If the bahereth departed and left (i.e., \"deposited\") the white hair in its place and then it (the bahereth) returned — Akavya ben Mehalalel rules it unclean.

And the sages rule them clean, [it being written (Leviticus 13:10): \"…and it (the bahereth) turned the hair white\" — only if it turned it white, and not its neighbor. And (Akavya ben Mahalalel) declared unclean the 'green' blood of a niddah, holding it to be like the color of the bright-colored crocus, one of the \"unclean\" colors, which had faded (from the red)]. And he would permit derivation of benefit to a Cohein of the wool of a first-born blemished animal, that had fallen (to the ground) and which he had placed on the window, after which he slaughtered it.

[For if you permit to him its wool that falls (to the ground) while it is alive, they will come to delay (the slaughtering of) a firstling so that its wool fall always, and they will (also) come to shear and work with it; and it is forbidden to shear and to work with unfit consecrated animals, it being written (Deuteronomy 12:11): \"…you shall slaughter and eat flesh\" — you shall slaughter, and not shear. And Akavya permits it. For since shechitah avails for (enjoyment of) the wool, which is attached to it, afterwards, it also avails for the wool that has been torn off and placed in the window.] He would say: [The sotah's draught] is not administered to a proselytess or an emancipated maidservant, [it being written (in the oath administered to the sotah [Numbers 5:21]): \"May the L rd render you a curse and an oath in the midst of your people,\" excluding those who are not \"in the midst of your people.\"] And the sages say: They do make them drink. They said to him: There was once an incident of this kind in Jerusalem involving a freed maidservant, Carcamith, and the draught was administered to her by Shemaya and Avtalyon!, whereupon he (Akavya) said to them: \"They made her drink the like!\" [i.e., they did so because they were (proselytes) like her, and not because this was the law. Another interpretation: They gave her the impression that they were giving her the bitter waters to drink, but they were not really doing so.] And they excommunicated him (Akavya), [for having cheapened the honor of Shemaya and Avtalyon]. And he died in his state of excommunication and beth-din stoned his coffin. R. Yehudah said: G d forbid that Akavya was excommunicated. For the (doors of the) azarah (the Temple court) closed on no man in Israel [on Pesach eve, when they went in to slaughter their Pesach offerings, (viz.: \"When the first contingent went in, they closed the doors of the azarah, etc.\")] greater in wisdom and fear of sin than Akavya ben Mahalalel.

Eliezer says: They (the sages) said [that body parts have no (minimum) size (for tumah] only about a part from a living animal, [but a part from a dead animal requires a (minimum) size for tumah]. They said to him: Is it not derivable by kal vachomer (a fortiori) [that a part from a dead animal (even less than an olive-size) is tamei, viz.] If from a living animal, which is tahor (clean), a part (even less than an olive-size) which separates from it is tamei — a dead animal, which is tamei, does it not follow (a fortiori) that a part which separates from it is tamei? He said to them: They spoke only about a part from a living animal. And, furthermore, [in rebuttal of the kal vachomer], the tumah of the living is greater than that of the dead! For the living [i.e., a zav, when he is alive,] renders unclean via mishkav and moshav (couch and seat uncleanliness) [all of the vessels] beneath him, [even one hundred of them] to render a man unclean and to render garments unclean, [viz. (Leviticus 15:5): \"And a man who touches what he (a zav) lay upon shall wash his clothes.\"] And he renders what is above him \"madaf\" [All the vessels above the zav, though they be a hundred, one above the other, acquire madaf uncleanliness; that is \"light\" tumah, not rendering men and vessels unclean, as do mishkav and moshav which are beneath him, but (only) food and drink. (\"madaf\" as in Leviticus 26:36: \"the sound of a driven [nidaf] leaf\") — that is, \"light\" tumah. Or, as in \"its open nodef (spreads),\" the \"odor\" of the tumah of the zav spreading far to render unclean all of the vessels above him, even though he did not touch them] —- which is not effected by a dead body. [For of the vessels beneath a dead body, only the first, second, and third acquire uncleanliness, by maga (contact). The vessel touching the dead body becomes like the dead body itself, rendering the vessel that touches it \"av\" (a \"father\" of uncleanliness.) And the third that touches becomes a rishon (\"first\"), after which vessels are not rendered tamei in turn, vessels acquiring tumah only from the av of tumah. Likewise, of the vessels above the dead body, only the first, second, and third are tamei, by way of maga, (contact), and not by way of mishkav and moshav.]",

And when it is separated from the limb of a living man, R. Nechunia rules it tamei, etc.] They said to R. Eliezer: Why did you see fit to rule tamei an olive-size of flesh which separates from the limb of a living man?

Just as with a dead body, an olive-size of flesh which separates from it is tamei, so with a limb (separated) from a living man — an olive-size of flesh which separates from it should be tamei. They: No, it follows that an olive-size of flesh separated from a dead body is tamei, for [it (a dead body) has another stringency, viz.] a bone the size of a barley-corn, separated from it is [also] tamei. But would you, therefore, rule tamei an olive-size of flesh separated from a living man [which lacks such a stringency] when you have ruled tahor a bone the size of a barley-corn which separates from it? [viz. above: \"A bone the size of a barley-corn which separates from the limb of a living man — R. Nechunia rules it tamei and R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua, tahor.\" From his own words they challenge his inference; and thus with R. Nechunia.] They said to R. Nechunia: Why did you see fit to rule tamei a bone the size of a barley-corn that separates from the limb of a living man? He answered: We find a limb (separated) from a living man to be like a dead body. Just as with a dead body, a bone the size of a barley-corn that separates from it is tamei, so with a limb (separated) from a living man — a bone the size of a barley-corn that separates from it should be tamei. They: No, it follows that a bone the size of a barley-corn that separates from a dead body is tamei, for an olive-size of flesh separated from it is [also] tamei. But would you, therefore, rule tamei an olive-size of flesh separated from the limb of a living man, when you have ruled tahor an olive-size of flesh that separates from it? They said to R. Eliezer: Why did you see fit to divide your rulings (to rule tamei an olive-size of flesh separated from the limb of a living man and to rule tahor a bone the size of a barley-corn separated from the limb of a living man?) It should be either tamei in both case or tahor in both cases. He answered: Greater is the tumah of the flesh than the tumah of the bones. For flesh (uncleanliness) obtains with carrion and creeping things (sharatzim), as opposed to bone (uncleanliness), [it being written (Leviticus 11:36): \"And one who touches their carcass\" — their carcass, and not their bones, and not their horns, and not their hooves — whence we see that bones are not subject to carrion (neveilah) uncleanliness]. Another proof [that the tumah of flesh is more prevalent than that of bones]: A limb that has upon it sufficient flesh causes tumah by maga, masa, and ohel. If it is lacking flesh it is tamei; if it is lacking bone, it is tahor. [A limb does not cause tumah unless it has flesh, sinews, and bones, it being written (Numbers 19:16): \"or the bone of a man\" — Just as a man has flesh, sinews, and bones, so, all that has flesh, sinews, and bones. And if it were deficient in the flesh that was upon it, but there were left on it enough flesh that would heal if it were connected to a living man, it would cause tumah by reason of \"a limb.\" And this is the intent of \"If it is lacking flesh it is tamei.\" But if it is missing anything of the bone in the limb, it no longer causes tumah by reason of \"limb.\" And this is the intent of \"If it is lacking bone, it is tahor.\" That is, it is tahor by reason of \"limb,\" but tamei by reason of \"flesh.\" We therefore find the tumah of \"flesh\" to be more prevalent than that of \"bone.\"] They said to R. Nechunia: Why did you see fit to divide your rulings? It should be either tamei in both cases or tahor in both cases. He answered: Greater is the tumah of the bones than the tumah of the flesh. For the flesh that separates from a living man is tahor, but if a limb separates from him, and it is in its natural state, [having flesh, sinews, and bones], it is tamei. Another proof (that the tumah of bones is more prevalent than that of flesh) is that an olive-size of flesh causes tumah by maga, masa, and ohel [(Because the beginning of the creation of a man is an olive-size, his tumah is an olive-size)], and the majority [125] of a man's bones [248] cause tumah by maga, masa, and ohel. If the flesh is lacking [an olive-size], it is tahor [entirely, from causing tumah — either by maga, or by masa, or by ohel.] If the majority of the bones are missing, even though he is tahor from causing tumah by ohel, he causes it by maga and masa. [For a bone the size of a barley-corn causes tumah by maga and masa — whence we see that the tumah of bones is more prevalent than that of flesh. For bones, (even) when their quantity (125) is lacking, tumah remains in them, whereas flesh, when its (minimum) size is lacking, is absolutely tahor.] Another proof: All the flesh of a dead body which is less than an olive-size is tahor, but the rov (majority) of the (bony) structure of a dead body [such as two forelegs and one thigh, (all of his structure being two forelegs and the thighs and the ribs and the spine)], and the rov of its number, though they lack a rova (a quarter), [(a rova of a kav of the bones of a dead body causes tumah in an ohel), still, even if they have neither the majority of the number nor the majority of the structure (but they have a rova); or if they have a majority of the number or a majority of the structure, but they lack a rova], they cause tumah. They said to R. Yehoshua: Why did you see fit to rule tahor in both cases? He answered: No, it follows that an olive-size of flesh [and a bone that separate from a dead body be tamei] for it has [stringencies like] \"rov,\" \"rova,\" and \"rakav.\" Would you say the same thing about a living man, who does not have [the stringencies of] \"rov,\" \"rova,\" and \"rakav\"? [It does not follow that an olive-size of flesh or a barley-corn size of bone which separate from a living man should be tamei, but they are tahor. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehoshua. (\"rakav\":) the dead body, when its moisture dissipates, becomes a kind of rotten (rakuv) earth, a full tarod of which (about a full hand-hollow of the average man) causes tumah. A full tarod causes tumah only (when taken) from a body buried naked in a marble coffin and covered with a marble cover, until it be known of a certainty that there is no admixture of the rottenness of a garment or of wood or of other earth. But a dead body that is buried in its garment or in a coffin of wood or earth has no rakav, and, likewise, a dead body buried without a limb.]"

Eliezer says: He (the owner) is liable to restore it, as [he is liable to restore (if they were lost)] the five selaim for [the redemption of his (first-born) son.] And the sages say: He is not liable to restore it, but it is like the (lost) redemption (money) for the second tithe, [which the Torah required him (to spend on food) to eat in Jerusalem — but he has lost it! The rationale of R. Eliezer: We find that the Torah compared the redemption of the firstling of an ass to (that of) the first-born son of a man, it being written (Exodus 34:20): \"And the firstling of an ass shall you redeem with a lamb … All the first-born of your sons shall you redeem.\" And the sages say: It is written (Numbers 18:15): \"But redeem shall you redeem the first-born of the man, and the first-born of the unclean beast (an ass) shall you redeem\" — I have likened it (to a man) for purposes of redemption, and not for other things.]",

For an earlier Mishnah (taught): Unclean locusts which were pickled with clean locusts do not invalidate their brine. [They were lenient in respect to unclean locusts not to forbid their admixture, for they have no blood, but only a kind of moistness. This was the first Mishnah. And the testimony of R. Tzaddok added to this Mishnah to say that it is clean. Not only does it not forbid its admixture, but it itself is clean.]",
            "\tR. Tzaddok testified — that they are kosher — about running waters [zochalin viz. (Deuteronomy 32:24): \"zochalei afar\" (\"the 'crawlers' in the dust\"), which, halachically, are equivalent to a well, which purifies with any amount of running water, and which are kosher for the consecration of the waters of the sin-offering (the red heifer) and for the immersion of zavim], which (zochalin) (intermixed with and) \"outnumbered\" the notfim [\"dripping waters,\" like rain water, which, halachically, is like a mikveh, which purifies, with forty sa'ah and in an eshboren (a water collection pit), and which are unfit for the consecration of the waters of the sin-offering, not being \"living waters,\" and likewise, for the immersion of zavim — When the running waters have mixed with the dripping waters and \"outnumbered\" the dripping waters, they are halachically like running waters and are kosher for the consecration of the waters of purification (of the red heifer) and for the immersion of zavim, and they cleanse, as running waters do, with any amount.] It (such an \"outnumbering\") once occurred in Biryath Hapilya, and they brought it to the attention of the sages, who pronounced them (the waters) kosher.",

If, when it was moist, he made it like a tube through which the zochalim would run and jet outside of it, the jetted waters are halachically zochalim, and they are kosher for the waters of purification (the red heifer), and the immersion of zavim. And we do not say that since they entered through this shell, which acts as a receptacle through which they are jetted out, they are not halachically zochalin — for that shell is not considered a vessel.] This once happened in Ahalya, and it came before the lishkath hagazith (the seat of the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem), and they ruled it kosher.",

Yakim Ish Hadar testified about the [earthen] pitcher of the (ashes of) purification (of the red heifer), which was placed upon a sheretz (a creeping thing), that it [i.e., what it contains, (the ashes)] is tamei. [The pitcher itself does not become tamei, for an earthenware vessel does not contract tumah from the outside. Still, the ashes are tamei, it being written (Numbers 19:9): \"And he shall place it outside the encampment in a clean place.\" [(For R. Eliezer had ruled it clean, holding that since the vessel containing it was clean, it could be called \"a clean place.\" The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.)] R. Papiyas testified about one who resumed two [unqualified] Naziritisms [and every unqualified Naziritism lasts for thirty days] that if he shaved for the first on the thirtieth day, he shaves for the second on the sixtieth day. [For ab initio, he should shave on the thirty-first day, so that his Naziritism be thirty whole days; but if he shaved on the thirtieth day, he has satisfied his Naziritism for we say that \"part of the day is like the whole day.\" And if he shaves on the fifty-ninth day, he has satisfied (his Naziritism), for the thirtieth day is reckoned as part of the counting (for the second Naziritism). [That is, the thirtieth day of the first Naziritism counts for both reckonings. And since the thirtieth day of the first Naziritism is counted also as (the first day of) the second Naziritism, it is found that the thirty days of the second Naziritism end on the fifty-ninth day.]",

And the sages say (that the offspring of a shelamim) is sacrificed. R. Papyas said: I testify that we had a cow for a shelamim (sacrifice), which we ate on Pesach, and we ate its offspring as a shelamim on the festival [of Shavuoth. For if he waited until Succoth he would be in transgression of the positive commandment, viz. (Deuteronomy 12: 5-6): \"…and you shall come there… and you shall bring there,\" the implication being that the first festival that you come there (after the vow), bring there all the vows binding upon you.

For though, according to the Torah, flat boards are not thus susceptible, the Rabbis decreed that they are (viz. Kelim, Chapter II)]. For R. Eliezer ruled them clean, [holding that they are not considered vessels at all, not even like flat wooden vessels. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.]",

[The olive boilers and the dyers used to have large vats on whose rims they placed a border of clay to contain the water when it boiled over. That (i.e., the rim) of the olive boilers was tamei because that addition was needed for the vessel and was used; and the Torah stated in respect to an oven or a stove (Leviticus 11:31): \"They shall be unclean to you\" — \"to you,\" to all that you need; that is, the thing in the vessel that you need and use — it is that which is susceptible of tumah.

For a woman can be divorced perforce, so that her consent is not required.]; and (he testified) that the minor daughter of an Israelite [an orphan, whose marriage is rabinically (and not Scripturally) sanctioned] eats terumah [rabbinically mandated terumah, this not being decreed against by reason of (the possibility of her coming to eat) Scripturally mandated terumah]; and that if she died, her husband inherits her; and that if one built a beam that he had stolen into a building, monetary reimbursements is sufficient, [for the good of the penitent; for if he were required to raze his building and return the beam itself, he would be deterred from repenting.]; and that a stolen sin-offering which was not known to the public [as being stolen] atones [and another need not be brought], for \"the good of the altar,\" [that the Cohanim not be distressed by (the thought of) having eaten chullin (non-consecrated food) from (an animal) slaughtered in the azarah (the Temple court) and the altar be \"deserted,\" the Cohanim refraining from performing the (sacrificial) service.]"

For there is nothing but the sheretz (a creeping thing) which causes tumah with (the same quantity of) its blood as with (that of) its flesh. As to our having learned above (5:1): \"The blood of neveiloth — Beth Shammai rule it tahor\" — Beth Shammai ruled it tahor entirely. \"And Beth Hillel ruled it tamei\" — but not as (the flesh of) a neveilah, an olive-size of which is tamei, but only with a revi'ith.]",

[It is added here that once she enters the chupah, even though she had not yet had conjugal relations, (she may eat terumah). For from the preceding testimony, we can conclude that she eats terumah only when she has had conjugal relations]. R. Yossi Hakohen and R. Zecharyah ben Hakatzav testified about a minor who was taken as a pledge [by gentiles] in Ashkelon and whose family \"distanced\" her (from marrying a Cohein), and whose witnesses (to her having been taken as a pledge) testify that she had not been secreted and had not been violated — the sages said to them (the family): If you believe (the witnesses) that she had been taken as a pledge, then believe that she had not been secreted and had not been violated. And if you do not believe that she had not been secreted and not been violated, then do not believe that she had been taken as a pledge. [And it is only of this one, about whom the witnesses testify that she had not been violated, that the rabbis said — \"Believe her,\" and that she had been wrongfully distanced by her family. But if she had no witnesses (that she had not been violated), then a woman who had been taken as a pledge for money at a time when the gentiles had the upper hand is forbidden to her husband, a Cohein, whether she had been taken willingly or forcibly.]",

And if a woman married one of that family and her husband died, she is called an \"issah\" widow. For just as dough is kneaded and intermixed, so this widow is \"mixed\" with (i.e., compounded of) doubts: one, her husband might not be that safek chalal; and,(the other), even if he is, perhaps he is not a chalal in reality. R. Yehoshua permits her to the priesthood, for we have a \"a doubt of a doubt,\" in which instance we rule leniently.] And R. Gamliel holds that even though generally we rule leniently in \"a doubt of a doubt,\" here it is different, for \"a special eminence is accorded to family lineage.\"] (And they testified) that an issah (family) is kosher both for (declaring) tamei or declaring tahor, for distancing or for drawing near. [That is, a family in which a safek chalal has become intermixed is in a status of kashruth as are all of the pedigreed families. And just as the other families may say: \"This one is tamei,\" and they distance themselves from her, and: \"This one is tahor,\" and they draw her near, so, (about) this family in which a safek chalal has become intermixed, we cannot say that since a safek has become intermixed in it they need no longer examine, when they marry women, which is tamei and which is tahor in order to distance her who is tamei and to draw near her who is tahor.] R. Gamliel said: We have accepted your testimony, but what can we do? For R. Yochanan b. Zakkai has decreed not to convene batei-din for this [i.e., for permitting an issah widow ab initio. For] the Cohanim will heed you to distance her [if you rule her forbidden], but not to draw her near [if you rule her permitted.

[According to one view they are entirely clean; for the tumah of liquids is not Torah-based, but of rabbinic decree, and in this instance they did not decree thus. According to another view they are \"clean\" in that they do not defile others; but they are tamei in themselves, for the tumah of liquids in themselves is Torah-based, and the Rabbis cannot permit what the Torah has proscribed]; and (he testified) that one who touches a dead body becomes tamei. [That is, one who, of a certainty, touches a dead body becomes tamei, but, in an instance of doubt (safek), even vis-à-vis the stringent tumah of a dead body, he is tahor — how much more so does he come to permit the lesser tumah of a sheretz and a safek of tumah in the public domain. And even though a safek of tumah in the public domain is tahor (even) according to the Torah — for the entire issur of safek tumah is derived from sotah, viz. (Numbers 5:13): \"…and she had secreted herself and she be defiled,\" Scripture telling us that she is forbidden in an instance of doubt (\"secreted, etc.\"), and just as sotah obtains only in the private domain, there being no \"secreting\" in the public domain, so the tumah of safek obtains only in the private domain — still, before the ruling of Yossi ben Yoezer, they said: \"It is a halachah (that tumah does not obtain in the public domain), but we do not teach it.\" And he came and testified that we do teach it ab initio, to render tahor every safek of tumah in the public domain.] And they called him \"Yossi, the permitter.\" [For he permitted three things vis-à-vis which they deported themselves as being forbidden. For every beth-din which permits three things whose heter (permit) is not apparent is called \"a permitting beth-din.\"]",

It was in the northeast corner of the ezrath nashim. Some bones of dead bodies were found there) ]: The sages said: They are removed bone by bone and all is tahor [i.e., We do not fear that men or vessels may have become tamei through them, for this constitutes \"safek tumah in the public domain,\" which is tahor. And in the last chapter of Zevachim the Gemara adduces that they wished to decree tumah in all of Jerusalem because of the bones which were found in the wood compartment, but R.

R. Yehoshua said: I heard that sacrifices are offered even when there is no Temple, and that holy of holies are eaten even where there are no curtains; lesser order sacrifices and second tithe, even when there is no wall. For the first consecration [of the Temple by Solomon] was for that time and for future time.

(But a family that had been \"infiltrated\" because the p'sul was not known will be left in its status of kashruth)], and [he will come] to draw near all who had been (wrongly) distanced by force. The family of Beth Tzerifah was across the Jordan and Ben Tziyon [a man of violence] distanced it [i.e., proclaimed it pasul] by force. And another family was there [which was pasul], and Ben Tziyon drew it near by force [i.e., he proclaimed them to be kosher for marriage. The tanna was solicitous of men's honor and did not mention the name of the family that Ben Tziyon drew near by force as he did mention the name of the family that was kasher, to teach how much one should take care not to speak in denigration of his friend and \"to cover shame.\" If thus with those who are pasul, how much more so with those who are kasher!] Such as these [whose kashruth and p'sul are known but who have been distanced by force or drawn near by force] Eliyahu will come to pronounce tamei and tahor, to distance and to draw near. R. Yehudah says: (He will come) to distance, but not to draw near. [He will draw near the kosher family, which was distanced by force, but he will not distance the family that was drawn near by force.] R. Shimon says: He will come to resolve disputes (among the sages). And the sages say: Neither to distance nor to draw near, but to make peace, as it is written (Malachi 3:24): \"Behold, I am sending to you Eliyahu the prophet… and he will return the heart of the fathers to the sons and the heart of the sons to their fathers.\" [He (Eliyahu) is destined to say through the Holy Spirit: \"This one is a descendant of that one.\" And according to R. Shimon, \"fathers\" are the sages, and \"sons,\" the disciples — their hearts will be attuned to each other and dispute (machloketh) will not befall them.]"
