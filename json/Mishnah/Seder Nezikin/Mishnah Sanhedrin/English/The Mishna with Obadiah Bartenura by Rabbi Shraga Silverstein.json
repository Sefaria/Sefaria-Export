            "\tMonetary litigations (are presided over) by three (judges) [(even) non-experts, the rabbis not requiring three experts, so that \"the door not be closed to loans,\" (i.e., lest the debtor deny (the loan) and he (the creditor) not find experts to force him to law. But one expert or three non-experts suffice.] Thefts and injuries (are presided over) by three, [\"elohim\" (\"judges\") being written three times in the section on shomrim (caretakers) (Exodus 22), whence we derive that three experts are required.] (Litigations of) nezek (damage), [a man or a mued (\"habitual damager\") ox, which pay a complete nezek for damaging], a half-nezek, [a tam (\"non-habitual damager\") ox, which caused damage. (Even though nezek comes under chavaloth (injuries), since \"double payment\" (kefel) and \"four and five\" payment are to be taught, where the payment is not equal to the damage, but more, half-nezek is also taught, where the payment is, likewise, not equal to the damage, but less. And since half-nezek is taught, nezek is also taught)], double payment, and \"four and five\" payment (are presided over) by three. (Litigations of) ravishment and seduction and imputation of \"an evil name\" [viz.: (Deuteronomy 22:17): \"I did not find your daughter to be a virgin,\" (Ibid. 19): \"Then they shall fine him a hundred (shekels of) silver\"] (are presided over) by three. These are the words of R. Meir. And the sages say: Imputations of an evil name (are presided over) by twenty-three, for they may involve capital punishment. [For if it were (found to be) true that she was adulterous, then she is stoned; and capital cases are tried by twenty-three (1:4).]",
            "\t(Adjudications of) [forty] stripes (are presided over) by three, [it being written (Deuteronomy 25:1): \"And they shall draw near to judgment, and they (two judges) shall judge them,\" and since beth-din cannot be evenly balanced, a judge is added, making three.] R. Yishmael says: \"Twenty-three. [He derives it by identity: \"wicked\"-\"wicked,\" it being written here (in respect to stripes) (Deuteronomy 25:1): \"And they shall incriminate the wicked one,\" and, elsewhere, (Numbers 35:31): \"…who is a wicked one (condemned) to die.\" Just as there, twenty-three, so here, twenty-three.] Intercalation of the month [i.e., sanctification of the new moon (Since \"intercalation of the year\" follows, \"intercalation of the month\" is taught.)] (is presided over) by three. Intercalation of the year (is presided over) by three. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: They begin with three, deliberate with five, and end with seven. [They begin with three to see if it is necessary to seat a beth-din for this. If one of the three says that beth-din must sit and see if it is necessary to intercalate the year because of the season, the spring, or the fruits, and two say that it is not necessary, that there is no doubt here, that of a certainty, intercalation is not called for, the one is in the minority and he is overruled. If two say to sit, and one, not to sit, the two are followed, and two more are added to deliberate the matter, so that now there are five. If two say that it is necessary to intercalate, and three, that it is not, the two are in the minority and they are overruled. If two say that it is not necessary, and three, that it is, the majority is followed and another two are added, making seven, who intercalate the year. The Gemara explains that these \"three, five, and seven\" correspond to the priestly blessing, there being three words in the first verse, five in the second, and seven in the last. The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel.] And if they ended with three, it is (nevertheless) intercalated.",
            "\tThe placing of the hands of the elders (semichath zekenim) [on the bullock of he'elam davar, (communal transgression through judicial error)] (required three judges.) [Also implied is the appointment of a judge — the senior, ordained judge requiring two to join him when he wishes to ordain a sage to be called \"Rebbi\" and to rule in penalty (knass) judgments. The term \"semichah\" is used by reason of (Numbers 28:23): \"And he (Moses) placed his hands upon him\" (Joshua). It is not necessary (in our instance) that he place his hands upon him but that he add the title \"Rebbi\" to his name. There is no semichah outside of Eretz Yisrael, but both the ordainer and the one to be ordained must be in Eretz Yisrael. If this condition is satisfied, he has the authority to rule in knass judgment even outside of Eretz Yisrael, Sanhedrin functioning both in Eretz Yisrael and outside it following ordination in Eretz Yisrael. Rambam writes that it seems to him that at the present time, when there is no ordination, one man by another back to Moshe Rabbeinu, if all of the sages in Eretz Yisrael agreed to ordain one or many, they are duly ordained, and they are authorized to rule in knass judgments and to ordain others. The matter requires determination.] (\"the placing of the hands of the elders\") and the breaking of the neck of the heifer (see Deuteronomy 21:2) require three judges, [it being written (Leviticus 4:15): \"the elders of the congregation.\" The minimum of elders is two, and a beth-din cannot be evenly balanced, so that another is added, making three.] These are the words of R. Shimon. R. Yehudah says: Five are required, [viz.: \"And they shall place\" — two; \"the elders\" — two, and a beth-din cannot be evenly balanced, so that another is added, making five. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah.] Chalitzah (levirate refusal) and miunin (refusals) require three. [(\"Chalitzah\":) It is written (Deuteronomy 25:9): \"Then his yevamah shall draw near to him before the eyes of the elders\": \"elders\" — two; and a beth-din cannot be evenly balanced, so that another is added, making three. The two others that are added are (added in order) to publicize the matter. (\"miunin\":) If a minor orphan girl were married to a man by her mother and brothers with her consent, and she (later) wished to leave him by miun (\"refusal\"), the miun must be before three judges. (In Yevamoth it is indicated that miun before two suffices.)] Neta revai (planting of the fourth year) [if he comes to redeem it for money] and [similarly] second-tithe, whose monetary value is not known [e.g., rotted fruit, which has no fixed price], and (Temple) dedications, [if one comes to redeem them] require three judges. Valuations in movables require three [i.e., If one said: \"the valuation of that man is upon me\" (to give to the Temple), and he had no money to give as per the monies specified in the section (on valuations), and he desired to give it in movables, three judges are required to assess those movables.] R. Yehudah said: One of them must be a Cohein, [it being written in respect to valuations (Leviticus 27:12): \"as the Cohein valuates it for you.\"] And (valuations) in land require nine and a Cohein. [If he has no movables and he comes to give land, ten men, one of them a Cohein, must assess that land for the imposed valuation.] And the same applies for (the worth of) a man. [If he said: \"The worth of that man is upon me\" (to give to the Temple), in which instance the man's market value is assessed and the monies given, that assessment, likewise, requires ten men, one of them a Cohein.]",
            "\tCapital cases require twenty-three judges. (Judgment of) the active and the passive participant in sodomy requires twenty-three, it being written (Leviticus 20:16): \"And you shall kill the woman and the beast,\" [the active participant, which is likened to the woman. Just as the woman (is judged) by twenty-three, so is the beast in this instance], and it is written (Ibid. 15): \"and the beast (in this instance, the passive participant) shall you kill\" — whence we derive (twenty-three judges for) the active and the passive participant.] An ox facing stoning requires twenty-three judges, it being written (Exodus 21:29): \"The ox shall be stoned, and also its owner shall die\" — As the death of the owner, so is the death of the ox [i.e., Just as the owner in capital cases is judged by twenty-three, so, etc.] The death (by stoning) of the wolf, the lion, the bear, the tiger, the leopard, and the snake requires twenty-three judges. R. Eliezer says: Whoever is first to kill them merits it, [and it is not necessary to bring them to beth-din.] R. Akiva says: Their death requires twenty-three judges. [The Gemara explains that the first tanna and R. Akiva differ with respect to a snake. The first tanna requires twenty-three judges for putting a snake to death, whereas R. Akiva requires that number for wolf, lion, bear, tiger, and leopard, whereas with a snake — \"Whoever comes first merits it\"; for he rids the world of a scourge. The halachah is in accordance with R. Akiva.]",
            "\tA tribe and a false prophet and a high-priest are not judged except by a beth-din of seventy-one. [(\"a tribe\":) the majority of a tribe that served idols, it being written (Deuteronomy 17:5): \"Then you shall take that man or that woman … to your gates\": A man or a woman you take out to your gates (of judgment), but you do not take out a tribe to your gates, but to the Great Beth-din (of seventy-one judges.) (\"a false prophet\":) This is derived by identity: \"thing-thing\" from a rebellious elder, it being written here (in respect to a false prophet (Deuteronomy 18:20): \"…who shall presume to speak a thing,\" and in respect to a rebellious elder (Ibid. 17:8): \"If there be hidden from you a thing.\" Just as a rebellious elder is judged by the Great Beth-din, viz. (Ibid.): \"Then you shall arise and go up to the place, etc.\", so a false prophet is judged by the Great Beth-din. (\"a high-priest\":) it being written (Exodus 18:22): \"The great thing shall they bring to you\": The things of the \"great one\" (i.e., the high-priest) shall they bring to you (Moses)\", and Moses was in place of seventy-one.] And the people are not taken out to a \"permitted\" war. [(Every war except the war with the seven nations and the war with Amalek is called a \"permitted\" war)] except by a beth-din of seventy-one, [it being written in respect to David (I Chronicles 27:34): \"and after Achitofel came Benayahu ben Yehoyada\": Achitofel — the counselor; Benayahu ben Yehoyada — the Sanhedrin, of which he (Benayahu) was the mufla (the \"elect\"), whom all followed.] Additions to the city, [Jerusalem, whose sanctity is greater than that of the rest of Eretz Yisrael] and to the azaroth (the Temple courts), [whose sanctity is greater than that of Jerusalem] are made only by a beth-din of seventy-one. [It is not permitted to originate sanctity except through a beth-din of seventy-one, it being written (Exodus 25:9): \"According to all that I show you … and thus shall you do,\" for (subsequent) generations, viz.: Just as the tabernacle was sanctified through Moses, who was in place of the Great Sanhedrin, so, for (subsequent) generations, additions to the city and to the azaroth are made by the Great Sanhedrin.] Sanhedraoth (of twenty-three judges) are not made for the tribes except by a beth-din of seventy-one, [as we find with Moses, who established sanhedraoth, Moses being in place of seventy-one.] A \"condemned city\" is declared only by a beth-din of seventy-one, [it being written (Deuteronomy 17:5): \"Then you shall take out that man or that women … to your gates\": You take out the man or woman to your \"gates,\" i.e., to the beth-din (of twenty-three) in your gates; but you do not take out the entire city to your gates, but to the \"distinctive gate,\" (i.e., the Great Sanhedrin)]. And a \"condemned city\" is not made in a border city, [one between Eretz Yisrael and the land of the nations, it being written (Deuteronomy 13:14): \"from your midst,\" and not from a border city. The rationale: Lest the nations hear and come and ravage Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, the city is not made \"a heap forever,\" as indicated for a condemned city, but its inhabitants are killed alone.] And not three, but they make one or two. [i.e., One beth-din does not make three cities \"condemned cities\" in one place, close to one another. But they do make them in two or three places.]",
            "\tThe Great Sanhedrin was composed of seventy-one judges, and the lesser sanhedrin, of twenty-three. Whence is it derived that the Great Sanhedrin consisted of seventy-one? From (Numbers 11:16): \"Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel,\" and Moses over them, [viz. (Ibid 17): \"And they shall bear with you\" — together with you], making seventy-one. R. Yehudah says: Seventy. [He expounds \"with you\" as \"similar to you,\" and not that he must sit with them in judgment. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] And whence is it derived that the lesser consisted of twenty-three? From (Ibid. 35:24-25): \"And the congregation shall judge … and the congregation shall rescue.\" The congregation judges [i.e., Ten rule guilty], and the congregation rescues [i.e., Ten rule innocent], making twenty. [i.e., We derive from this that there must be twenty. If they are split, ten rule guilty, and ten, innocent.] And whence is it derived that a \"congregation\" is ten? From (Ibid. 14:27): \"How long for this evil congregation\" (of the spies), Yehoshua and Calev being excluded (from the twelve). And whence are the three additional derived? From (Exodus 23:2): \"Do not be after many for ill,\" I understand that I should be with them for good. Why, then, need I be told (Ibid.): \"After many to incline\"? (To be taught:) Not as your inclining for good (acquittal) is your inclining for ill (conviction). Your inclining for good is with (a majority of) one; your inclining for ill requires (a majority of) two (beyond the minimum ten). And since we cannot have a split beth-din, we add another one, making twenty-three. [The verse is understood thus: \"Do not be after many for ill,\" to convict by a majority of one over those ruling for acquittal; but \"after many to incline\" — with two, even for ill, when there are two more for conviction than for acquittal. Therefore, perforce, twenty-three are required. For there cannot be fewer than ten ruling for acquittal — viz.: \"And the congregation shall rescue,\" so that conviction cannot obtain with fewer than twelve. (\"and since we cannot have a split beth-din\":) Beth-din cannot be even-numbered; for if (it were, and) they were split (in their decision), we would have half against half, so that \"Your inclining for good is with one\" could not obtain. Therefore, an additional judge is added, making twenty-three.] And how many must there be in a city so that it qualify for a sanhedrin (of twenty-three)? One hundred and twenty. [The Gemara explains: Twenty-three, the small sanhedrin; three rows of twenty-three each sitting before them, from which to add to the judges if this becomes necessary (see 4:4); ten \"idlers\" (i.e., ten who are idle from all work and sit constantly in the house of study; two scribes to record the words of those who rule for acquittal and those who rule for conviction; two chazanim, sextons of beth-din, to administer stripes where prescribed and to summon the litigants; two litigants; two witnesses; two who declare them zomemin (\"scheming\"); two who declare the zomemin, zomemin; two (charity)collectors and a third to distribute the charity (charity being collected by two and being distributed by three); a blood-letter, a scribe; and a teacher of young children — making one hundred and twenty.] R. Nechemiah says: Two hundred and thirty, corresponding to \"officers of tens\" [i.e., twenty-three tens — so that each judge be an officer of ten, less than that not being regarded as \"authority.\" The halachah is not in accordance with R. Nechemiah.]"

Yehudah expounds: \"And from the sanctuary (mikdash), he shall not go out\" — at all. R. Meir expounds: \"And from his sanctity (kedushatho), he shall not go out,\" i.e., He should take care to avoid contact (with the body). And within the city, where there are alleyways, there is a distinguishing) sign, so that he takes care. The halachah is in accordance with R.

[For the memunah walks to the right of the high-priest, and all the people to his left, so that the high-priest is found to be in the middle.] And when he is consoled by others, all the people say to him: \"We are your atonement\" [i.e., You will receive atonement through us, and we are in your place for all that should come upon you], and he says to them: \"Be blessed by Heaven!\" And when they give him the mourner's meal, [for a mourner is forbidden to eat the first meal of his own food, and his kin and friends provide it for him], everyone sits on the ground [constricting themselves, and mourning for his suffering], and he sits [in (regard for his) dignity] on a bench.",

He does not administer chalitzah and his wife does not receive chalitzah. He does not perform yibum and his wife is not taken in yibum. R. Yehudah says: \"If he wishes to perform chalitzah or yibum, let him be remembered for the good!\" They said to him: He is not heeded, [for a king may not \"waive\" his honor, and it is demeaning for him to perform chalitzah and have her spit in his face; and if chalitzah does not obtain with a woman, neither does yibum.] And his widow is not wedded. R. Yehudah says: A king may marry a king's widow. For thus do we find with David, who married Saul's widow, viz.

Yehudah says: He may take more [than eighteen], so long as they do not turn his heart astray. R. Shimon says: He may not marry even one who turns his heart astray.] If so, why is it written (Deuteronomy 17\"7): \"And he shall not multiply for himself wives\"? Even such as Avigayil. [There are three different views on the matter: The first tanna holds that he may marry eighteen, even if they are immodest, and not more than eighteen, even if they are modest, this being the Scriptural decree. R. Yehudah holds that he may marry eighteen, even if they are immodest, but not more than eighteen of such; and he may marry as many modest, virtuous ones as he likes. He differs with the fist tanna on one count. R. Shimon holds that he may not marry even one immodest one, and not more than eighteen modest, virtuous ones. He differs from the first tanna on one count, and from R. Yehudah on both counts. The halachah is in accordance with the first tanna.] (Ibid. 16): \"He shall not multiply for himself horses,\" but (may take) only as many as he needs for his chariot.

One [of the litigants] selects for himself one [judge], and one selects for himself another, and the two [litigants together] select for themselves another, [a third judge. In this way, a true judgment is secured. For the litigants accept the verdict, saying: \"They judged us fairly.\" For the one found liable says: \"I myself selected one judge, and if he could have found something in my favor, he would have.\" And the third judge himself is inclined to find something in favor of both, both having selected him.] These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say: The two judges select a third, [without the knowledge of the litigants, so that the third judge not be inclined to either one of them. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] Each (of the litigants) may disqualify the judge of the other. [He may say to him: \"I do not wish the case to be tried by the beth-din that you chose.\"] These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say: When is this so? When he brings proof against them [(the judges that the other selected)] that they are kin or (otherwise) unfit. But if they were kasher or expert, he cannot disqualify them. [This is the intent: But if they were kasher, i.e., neither kin nor (otherwise) unfit, even if they were \"corner-sitters,\" they are regarded as experts, and he cannot disqualify them. The halachah: If the litigants accept someone to judge their case (whether one or many), and he rendered a decision, his ruling stands and they cannot controvert it, even if he is not \"an expert for the many.\" And if it were found that he erred — If he erred in a ruling of the Mishnah or in something adduced in the Gemara, the case is returned and judged as per the halachah. And if it cannot be returned (as when the one who was awarded money erroneously, went abroad), the judge is exempt from payment; for even though he contributed to the (financial) loss, he did not do so intentionally. And if he erred in his judgment, in something where tannaim, amoraim, or geonim differ, the ruling being in accordance with one, and this judge ruling in accordance with that gaon whose ruling is not the accepted one — If he had not taken (money from one) and placed (it) into the hand (of the other), the case is returned. And if it cannot be returned, he pays from his pocket. And if had \"taken and placed in hand,\" what is done is done, and he pays from his pocket. And a judge who had not been accepted by the litigants, but who arose (to judge) of himself, or one who had been appointed by the king or by some of the elders of the congregation — If he is not \"an expert for the many,\" even if he was granted permission by the Exilarch, his ruling is no ruling, whether or not he erred, and he is not in the class of the judges, but in that of the \"despots.\" And either of the litigants, if he wishes, may controvert his ruling and return the case to beth-din. And if he erred, and did not \"take and place in hand,\" the case is returned. And if it cannot be returned, he pays from his pocket, as per the halachah for all who contribute to (monetary) loss. And if he \"took and placed in hand,\" he pays from his pocket and he then takes (the money back) from the litigant he awarded it to contrary to the halachah. And \"an expert to the many\" who was accepted by the litigants or who was granted permission by the Exilarch — Even if he was accepted by the litigants; or if he were granted permission by the Exilarch, even if the litigants did not accept him — since he is an expert, if he erred, whether in a ruling of the Mishnah or in his judgment, and the case cannot be returned, he need not pay. And an expert who was granted permission by the Exilarch may compel the litigants to try their case before him, whether they wish to or not, both in Eretz Yisrael and outside it. And if one were granted permission by the Nassi in Eretz Yisrael, he can compel the litigants only in Eretz Yisrael. An \"expert\" is one who is versed in the written and the oral law and who can reason, draw comparisons, and understand one thing from another. And when he is recognized and acknowledged by the men of his generation, he is called \"an expert to the many,\" and he may judge alone, even without having been granted permission by the Exilarch.] Each (of the litigants) may disqualify the witnesses of the other. These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say: When (may he do so)? When he brings proof against them that they are kin or (otherwise) unfit. But if they were kasher, he cannot disqualify them. [The Gemara construes the difference between R. Meir and the sages as obtaining in an instance where a litigant says: \"I have two pairs of witnesses in this case,\" and he brought the first pair, and the other litigant and one other (witness) arose and said: \"They are unfit.\" R. Meir says that they may do so, not being considered \"interested witnesses,\" the first litigant maintaining that he has another pair. And if he seeks (that pair) and cannot find them, it is his loss. And the rabbis hold that even though he says at first that he has two pairs of witnesses, he may retract and say: \"I have only these,\" so that the ones who come to disqualify them are considered \"interested witnesses\" and their testimony is invalid.

Shimon said: In the beginning they called them \"the gatherers of shevi'ith\" [The Gemara interprets R. Shimon thus: In the beginning they called them \"the gatherers of shevi'ith.\" That is, those who gathered the fruits of shevi'ith for themselves were unfit to testify, just as those who traded in the fruits of shevi'ith.] With the increase of the \"extorters\" [those who requisitioned the king's portion, e.g., so many and so many korin of grain each year, so that they had to gather the produce of shevi'ith to fill the king's quota], they reverted to calling them \"traders in shevi'ith\" [i.e., they reverted to saying that \"the traders\" in the fruits of shevi'ith alone were unfit to testify, but those who gathered the produce of shevi'ith to give it to the king are fit to testify, since they do not gather it to store it for themselves. As to the halachah: Whoever commits a transgression punishable by judicial death penalty, kareth (cutting-off) or stripes, is unfit to testify, for one who has incurred the death penalty is called \"an evildoer,\" viz. (Numbers 35:31): \"...who is an evildoer (condemned) to die,\" as is one who has incurred stripes, viz. (Deuteronomy 25:2): \"And it shall be, if liable to stripes is the evildoer,\" and it is written (Exodus 23:1): \"Do not place your hand with an evildoer to be a false witness,\" which is expounded: \"Do not make an evildoer a witness.\" And if he receives stripes, he reverts to his fitness, viz. (Deuteronomy 25:3): \"And your brother (in receiving stripes) shall be demeaned before your eyes\" — Once he has been smitten, he is as your brother. And if he took money unlawfully, even though he incurs neither the death penalty nor stripes, he is unfit to testify, e.g., a thief, a robber, and a lender on interest. And if he took money in violation of a rabbinic ordinance, he is unfit to testify by rabbinic ordinance, e.g., pigeon racers, and \"forcers,\" who give money and take things that the owners do not wish to sell, charity collectors and tax collectors who take for themselves, and those who accept charity from gentiles in public — these and their like are unfit to testify by rabbinic ordinance. And their testimony is not invalid until they are exposed and publicized; but those who are unfit to testify by Torah law need not be thus exposed. And all who are unfit to testify, whether by Torah law or by rabbinic ordinance, if it can be ascertained that they have fully repented, and returned the money that they took unlawfully, and made a \"fence\" for themselves in the matter in which they sinned, so as not to repeat it, they return to their (state of) fitness. And those who game with kuvia, even though they are not guilty of theft even by rabbinic ordinance, they are unfit to testify, for they do not engage in \"the habitation of the world\" and have no fear of Heaven. And (they are thus unfit) only when they have no occupation but that, as per R. Yehudah (below). And this is the halachah. And when are they considered to have repented? When they break their dice and take it upon themselves not to game even gratis.] R. Yehudah said: When (are they unfit to testify)? When they have no occupation but that. But if they have an additional occupation, they are fit.",

[Only sons and daughters that his brother-in-law has from his wife's sister.

And he may not testify for his stepson's wife, for a woman is like her husband. And brothers, one vis-à-vis the other, whether from the father or from the mother, are first (of kin) in (i.e., vis-à-vis) first. Their sons, vis-à-vis each other are second in second. And the sons of their sons, vis-à-vis each other, are third in third. Third in first is always kasher, and it goes without saying, third in second. But second in second, and, it goes without saying, second in first, are both pasul (unfit). And just as you reckon for males, so you reckon for females. And every woman that you are pasul to, you are pasul to her husband. And every man that you are pasul to, you are pasul to his wife.] R. Yossi said: This is the Mishnah of R. Akiva, but an earlier Mishnah (reckons as invalidated kin) his uncle and his uncle's son.

(\"all who are fit to inherit him:\") i.e., the father's kin. But the mother's kin, such as \"his mother's brother\" above, are kasher (to testify) for him. For his mother's brother is not fit to inherit him. He, however, is fit to inherit his mother's brother, for which reason he is pasul to testify for him.] and all who are kin to him at that time (the time of the testimony). If he were (once) kin [e.g., his son-in-law, who is fit to inherit him by reason of his (the son-in-law's) wife], and he became removed, [his wife having died before he witnessed this (matter of potential) testimony], he is kasher. R. Yehudah says: Even if his daughter died, but he had children from her, he is (considered) kin. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Akiva.]",

[He is pasul for him all the days of the wedding.] Hater — whoever does not speak with him for three days out of hatred. They said to him: Israel is not suspect of this [to testify falsely out of hatred or love. And this is the halachah. It is only in respect to testifying that the rabbis differ. But in respect to judging they agree that he is pasul. For if he loves him, he will not find anything in his disfavor; and if he hates him, he will not try to find anything in his favor.]",
            "\tHow are the witnesses examined (to ascertain that they are telling the truth)? They would bring them in and intimidate them. [They would apprise them that the hirers of false witnesses themselves scorn them and call them wicked, viz., in respect to Navoth (I Kings 21:10): \"And seat two worthless people opposite him, and let them testify (falsely),\" the king's counselors themselves, who counseled hiring them, calling them \"worthless.\"] And they would take everyone out and leave the senior (witness) there, and they would say to him: \"How do you know that this one owed that one?\" If he said: \"He (the borrower) told me that he owes him,\" \"That man told me that he owes him,\" he has said nothing. [for people are wont to say that they owe in order not to be thought rich.] (He is not accepted as a witness) until he says: \"Before us he admitted to him that he owes him two hundred zuz.\" [i.e., Both of them were before us and his intent was to acknowledge the debt and have them witness the acknowledgement.] Then the second one is brought in and he is examined. If their stories jibe, they (beth-din) deliberate. If two say \"Not liable,\" and one says \"Liable,\" he (the borrower) is not liable. If two say \"Liable,\" and one \"Not liable,\" he is liable. If one says \"Not liable,\" and one says \"Liable\" — and even if two say \"Not liable\" or two say \"Liable,\" and one says \"I do not know\" — they add judges. [And even though if he had differed with the others, he, being in the minority, would be overruled, when he says \"I do not know,\" it is as if he had not sat in judgment, so it is as if the judgment were with two, and we require three.]",
            "\tWhen they (beth-din) finished the matter, they would bring them [the litigants] in. [For after hearing their claims, they would take them out so that they (beth-din) could deliberate and the litigants not hear who ruled liable and who not liable.] The senior judge would say: \"So and so, you are not liable; so and so, you are liable.\" And whence is it derived that when one of the judges goes out, he should not say: \"I found you not liable, but my colleagues found you liable. What can I do? They are the majority.\" From (Leviticus 19:16): \"Do not go as a tale-bearer among your people,\" and (Proverbs 11:13): \"He who reveals a secret is a tale-bearer.\"",
            "\tWhenever he brings proof (in his favor), he can overturn the verdict. If they said to him: \"Whatever proofs you have, bring them within thirty days\" — If he found (proof) within thirty days, he overturns it; if not, not. R. Shimon b. Gamliel asked: \"What is one to do if he did not find it within thirty days but did find it afterwards!\" If they (beth-din) said to him: \"Bring witnesses,\" and he said: \"I have no witnesses\"; if they said: \"Bring proof\" [a writ of credit], and he said: \"I have no proof,\" and afterwards he brought proof or found witnesses, it is of no account. [For he said \"I do not have,\" and we suspect him of forgery or of having hired false witnesses.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel said: \"What is one to do if he did not know that he had witnesses and he found witnesses, or if he did not know that he had proof and he found proof!\" [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel.] If they said to him: \"Bring witnesses,\" and he said: \"I have no witnesses\"; \"Bring proof,\" and he said: \"I have no proof,\" and then, seeing that he would lose the case, said: \"You and you come here and testify for me,\" or he produced proof from his afundah [(his belt; others say: a garment worn close to the skin)], it is of no account. [In this, even R. Shimon b. Gamliel concurs. For since he knew of them and denied it, he is certainly a liar. But if one says: I have witnesses or proof across the seas, he is not heeded to delay judgment until he sends abroad; but the ruling is given according to the evidence available at that time, and when he brings witnesses or proof, the ruling is overturned and the case is heard again as per the witnesses or proof that he brought.]"

            "\tBoth monetary litigations and capital cases require thorough cross-examination (of the witnesses), it being written (Leviticus 24:22): \"One judgment shall there be for you.\" [And, in respect to capital cases it is written (Deuteronomy 13:15): \"And you shall inquire and you shall search out.\" This is the law of the Torah. But the sages prescribed that the cross-examination not be drawn out in monetary litigations so that the door not be closed to loans (unless beth-din sense deceit). \"Cross-examination\" (drishah uchakirah) is on the issue itself, e.g., How much was lent? When was it lent? How was it lent? Where was it lent? And there is another line of questioning called \"examination\" (bedikah) not on the issue itself, e.g., What was he wearing? Were his clothes black or white? Was he standing or sitting when he lent him?] What is the difference between monetary litigations and capital cases. Monetary litigations (are judged) by three; capital cases, by twenty-three. [Deliberations in] monetary cases are opened either for non-liability or for liability. Capital cases are opened for acquittal and not for indictment. Monetary judgments are decided by (a majority of) one, both for non-liability or for liability. Capital cases are decided by one for acquittal, and by two, for liability. [Rulings found to be mistaken in] monetary cases are overturned both for non-liability and for liability. Capital cases are overturned for acquittal, but not for indictment. (In) monetary litigations all can register a plea for non-liability or for liability. (In) capital cases, all can register a plea for acquittal, but not for indictment. [If one of the disciples says: \"I have something to say for indictment,\" he is not heeded.] (In) monetary litigations the one (i.e., the judge) who argues for liability can (retract and) argue for non-liability, and the one who argues for non-liability can argue for liability. (In) capital cases, the one who argues for indictment can argue for acquittal, but the one who argues for acquittal cannot retract and argue for indictment. Monetary litigations are adjudicated in the daytime and concluded (even) at night. [viz. (Exodus 18:22): \"And they shall judge the people at every time,\" and (Deuteronomy 21:16): \"And it shall be on the day he causes his sons to inherit!\" How so? The day for the beginning of the judgment; the night for its conclusion.] Capital cases are adjudicated in the daytime and concluded in the daytime, [it being written (Numbers 25:4): \"And hang them up for the L rd against the sun.\"] Monetary cases are concluded on the day (of their adjudication) both for non-liability and for liability. Capital cases are concluded on the day (of their adjudication) for acquittal, and on the day afterwards for indictment, [viz. (Isaiah 1:21): \"She (Jerusalem) that was full of justice, where righteousness would lie over (i.e., where the judges would wait until the next day, hoping to find the defendant righteous) — now (they are) murderers!\" (i.e., they indict on the day of adjudication.)] Therefore, they (capital cases) are not adjudicated on the eve of a Sabbath or of a festival. [ For its conclusion would then be on the Sabbath. And it (the conclusion) cannot be left until after the Sabbath because of \"affliction (i.e., delay) of judgment.\" And to judge (i.e., to execute) him on the Sabbath is also not possible, for the four judicial death penalties do not override the Sabbath, it being written (Exodus 35:3): \"You shall not light a fire in all of your dwellings on the day of the Sabbath\" — to teach that those liable to burning are not burned on the Sabbath. The same applies to the other judicial death penalties.]",
            "\tCases of (ritual) uncleanliness and cleanliness begin from the senior (judge). Capital cases begin from the side [i.e., from those lesser in wisdom, who sat at the side, it being written (Exodus 23:2): \"Do not answer upon riv (written \"rav\") to deviate.\" That is, do not answer after the elect one in beth-din, to deviate from his words. For this reason, his words are heard only at the end.] All are kasher to adjudicate monetary litigations, [even a proselyte, if his mother were a Jewess. And a mamzer, too, is kasher to adjudicate monetary litigations.] But not all are kasher to adjudicate capital cases, but only Cohanim, Levites, and Israelites who can marry into the priesthood, [it being written (Exodus 18:22): \"And let them lighten your burden and bear with you (Moses)\" — they must be like you. Just as Moses our teacher was \"pedigreed,\" so beth-din must be pedigreed.]",
            "\tSanhedrin sat in a semi-circle, so that they could see each other, [it being written (Songs of Songs 7:3): \"Your navel is like the basin of the moon (sahar)\": \"Your navel is like the basin (agan)\" — this is Sanhedrin, which sits in the center of the world (the Temple site) and defends (maginah - similar to \"agan\") the entire world. And it is like the moon in that it sits in a circle like a half moon. (The Targum of moon is \"sihara.\") And they do not sit in a full circle because the litigants and the witnesses must come in and speak before all of them.] And two court scribes stood before them, one on the right; the other on the left, and they wrote down the words of the acquitters and the words of the indicters. R. Yehudah says: (There were) three. One wrote the words of the acquitters; another, the words of the indicters; and a third, the words of the acquitters and the words of the indicters, [so that there be two witnesses for the acquitters and two for the indicters. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",
            "\tAnd three rows of Torah scholars sat before them. [There were twenty-three in each row, lest the judges be split, the majority (i.e., a majority of one) indicting, and a minority acquitting, and \"inclination for ill\" is not with one, viz. (Exodus 23:2): \"Do not be after many for ill,\" so that two must be added, until seventy-one, that number never being exceeded. Therefore, forty-eight (Torah scholars) must be added for the complement of seventy-one. And because it is not respectful to make a row of Torah scholars more numerous than the judges, three rows are made.] And each of them knew his place. [For they were seated in order of their wisdom, so that each one had to know his place.] If they had to ordain (one as a judge) [as when one of the judges died], they would do so from the first (row). One from the second (row) would come to the first, and one from the third would come to the second. And they would pick another one from the congregation and seat him in the third (row). He would not sit in the place of the first, but in the place fit for him, [at the end of the third row. For the least of the scholars in the rows was greater than the greatest of the congregation.]",
            "\tHow are the witnesses intimidated [not to testify falsely] in capital cases? They would bring them in and intimidate them, viz.: Can it be that you are testifying (illegally) by conjecture or through hearsay, \"witness from witness\" (and not from direct observation), or (even) from a reliable person? Can it be that you do not know that we are going to cross-examine you thoroughly? Know that capital cases are not like monetary litigations. In monetary litigations, [where one testifies falsely to make another financially liable], he makes financial restitution and he is forgiven; but in capital cases, his (victim's) blood and the blood of his (unborn) descendants are on his head until the end of time. For thus do we find with Cain, who killed his brother, viz. (Genesis 4:10): \"The voice of your brother's bloods cries out to Me\": It is not written \"your brother's blood,\" but \"your brother's bloods\" — his blood and the blood of his children. (Another interpretation: \"your brother's bloods\" — his blood was bespattered on trees and stones). It is for this reason that man was created singly [to show that the entire world proceeded from one man] — in order to teach that if one causes a single Jewish soul to go lost, Scripture accounts it to him as if had caused an entire world to go lost; and if one sustains a single Jewish soul, Scripture accounts it to him as if he had sustained an entire world. And (man was created singly) for the fostering of peace, that one not say to his neighbor: \"My father (i.e., my original ancestor) was greater than yours,\" and that the heretics not say: \"There are many deities in heaven,\" [each creating man in its own image], and to declare the greatness of the Holy One Blessed be He; for man mints many coins from one die, and they are all the same, but the King of kings, the Holy One Blessed be He, mints every man from the die of the first man, and none of them is the same as his neighbor — for which reason every man must say: \"For my sake was the world created!\" And lest you (the witnesses) say: \"What need have we of this trouble!\" [to enter into this worry (by testifying) even truthfully] — Is it not already written (Leviticus 5:1): \"And he is a witness, or saw, or knew — if he does not tell, then he shall bear his sin!\" [so that you must testify to what you have seen.] And lest you say: \"Why have this one's (the defendant's) blood on our head?\" [i.e., It is better to stand in (violation of) \"if he does not tell\"] — it is already written (Proverbs 11:10): \"In the destruction of the wicked is joy,\" [so that if he is wicked, there is no sin (in testifying against him) at all.]"

And elsewhere (Ibid. 19:18): \"And the judges shall search out well\" (another two, making seven)]: Which seven year period [of the Jubilee]? Which year [of that seven year period]? Which month? On which date of the month? Which day [of the week]? Which hour [of the day?] In which place? [For all of these seven inquiries can lead to hazamah (having them declared \"scheming witnesses\"), and it may be that there are no witnesses who can do so for (the period of) the entire day, but who may be able to do so for that hour.] R. Yossi says: [Only three inquiries are needed:] Which day? Which hour\" In which place? [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yossi.

Perhaps he is a gentile. This is not one of the inquiries towards hazamah, but one of the general questions intended to catch the witnesses in a mutual contradiction, in which instance he (the accused) and they (the witnesses) are exempt (form punishment)].

With chakiroth, if one (of the witnesses) says: \"I do not know,\" their testimony is invalidated. [For they are no longer subject to hazamah through that chakirah.

[Even if all say: \"We do not know,\" the mitzvah of hazamah obtains. For hazamah is contingent only upon chakirah, (leaving the witnesses open) to the claim: \"You were with us at that time in a different place.\"] Both with chakiroth and with bedikoth, if they (the witnesses) contradict each other, their testimony is invalidated.

This, only until half of the month (has passed). But from half of the month on, their testimony is invalidated.

            "\tWhen the verdict was reached, he was taken out to be stoned. The stoning site was outside of beth-din [far from beth-din, so that when they were conducting him there something might be found in his defense and he be exonerated], viz. (Leviticus 24:14): \"Take the curser outside, etc.\" One man would stand at the entrance of beth-din with the scarves in his hand [to wave as a sign to return him], and another would ride on a horse (as) far from him as he could (still) see him. If someone says: \"I have something to say in his defense,\" the first waves the scarves and the rider runs and stops (the execution). And even if he says: \"I have something to say in my defense,\" he is returned, even four or five times, so long as there is substance in what he says. [And if there is no substance in what he says, he is returned only the first and second times, on the possibility that his fright had \"stopped up\" his defense and that he might regain his self-possession and formulate his claims. But he is not returned more than this. And he is provided with two Torah scholars to determine whether there is substance in his words, in which instance he is returned four or five times.] If they found something in his favor, he was acquitted. If not, he is taken out to be stoned. And a crier goes out before him, (proclaiming): \"This man is taken out to be stoned because he committed this and this transgression, and so and so are his witnesses\" [that he committed this and this transgression at this and this time at this and this place — this, to render them subject to hazamah.]",
            "\tAt a distance of ten cubits from the stoning site he is told: \"Confess.\" [For when he is close to it, he might panic and not be able to confess.] For all who are to be put to death confess. For all who confess have a share in the world to come, viz., Achan, who was told by Joshua (Joshua 7:19): \"My son, confer, now, glory upon the L rd, the G d of Israel, and make confession to Him [(And even though one is not executed by his own confession, the execution of Achan was dictated by the circumstances.)] …And Achan answered Joshua and said: 'In truth, I have sinned to the L rd, the G d of Israel and as thus and as thus have I done.'\" [The Gemara explains that he misappropriated the spoils in the time of Moses.] And whence do we derive that his confession atoned for him? From (Ibid. 25): \"And Joshua said: 'How you have sullied us! May the L rd sully you on this day!'\" — you are sullied on this day, but not for the world to come. And if he does not know how to confess, he is told: \"Say: 'Let my death be an atonement for all of my sins.'\" R. Yehudah says: If he knows that he was falsely testified against, he says: \"Let my death be an atonement for all of my transgressions except this one.\" This was countered: If so, all men (sentenced to death) will say this in order to acquit themselves [in the eyes of their fellows and thus come to discredit the judges and the witnesses. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",
            "\tAt a distance of four cubits from the stoning site, they remove his clothing, [it being written (Leviticus 24:23): \"And they stoned him\" — without his garment.] A man is covered in front [i.e., a small section in front (his genitals)], and a woman (is covered) in front and in back. These are the words of R. Yehudah. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] And the sages say: A man is stoned naked (except for that one region), but a woman is not stoned naked, (i.e., she must be fully clothed)].",
            "\tThe stoning site [from which he was thrown to the ground] was two (men's) heights. If he turned over on his heart, (facing the ground), he is turned over on his back, [for lying prone is more demeaning.] If he dies from it (i.e., from the fall), the requirement (of stoning) is satisfied; and if not, the second (witness) takes the stone and casts it at his heart. If he dies from that, the requirement is satisfied. If not, he is stoned by all of Israel, viz. (Deuteronomy 17:7): \"The hand of the witnesses shall be against him first to kill him, and the hand of all the people afterwards.\" All of those who are stoned are (afterwards) hung up. These are the words of R. Eliezer. And the sages say: Only the blasphemer [of the L rd] and the idolator are hung up, [the idolator also being a blasphemer, viz. (Numbers 15:30): \"And the soul who acts with a high hand … it is the L rd whom he blasphemes.\" And that section speaks of idolatry.] A man is hung up facing the people, and a woman facing the wood. These are the words of R. Eliezer. The sages say: A man is hung up and a woman is not hung up. R. Eliezer countered: \"Did not Shimon b. Shetach hang up women in Ashkelon?\" They answered: He hung up eighty women, and two are not judged [in one beth-din] in one day. [For it is not possible to seek a defense for each of them (in one day). So that the hanging up of those women must have been dictated by the circumstances, and cannot serve as a precedent. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.] How is he hung up (after he is executed)? A pole is sunk in the ground with a beam projecting from it, and his two hands are joined (and bound) together, and he is hung up [by his hands]. R. Yossi says: The beam is placed against the wall, and he is suspended upon it, as butchers do (with slaughtered animals). [It was not rooted in the ground, but one of its ends was on the ground, and the other inclined against the wall. The rationale of R. Yossi: The wood on which he was suspended was buried with him, and the Torah states (Deuteronomy 21:23): \"But bury shall you bury him\" — he who lacks only burying; to exclude that which lacks digging up, uprooting, and burying. And the (rationale of the) rabbis: Digging up is of no import. The Torah excluded only its being rooted from the beginning. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] And he is let down immediately. And if he is allowed to remain there overnight, he (the one who allows it) transgresses a negative commandment, viz. (Deuteronomy 21:23): \"You shall not leave his body overnight on a tree, but bury shall you bury it on that day; for killelath G d is suspended, etc.\" That is, why is this one suspended? Because he \"blessed\" (a euphemism for \"cursed\" - killel) the L rd, so that the name of Heaven is desecrated (by leaving him — a reminder of the curse — hanging there.)",
            "\tR. Meir says: When a man suffers [punishment because of his transgression], what does it (the Shechinah) say, (as it were) [i.e., How does it utter plaint and grievance over him?] \"Kalani meroshi\" [\"My head is heavy upon me\"], Kalani mizro'i\" [\"My arm is heavy upon me\" (as one who is fatigued;) \"kalani\" = \"I am not 'light'\"] If the L rd is thus aggrieved over the blood of the wicked that is spilled, how much more so over the blood of the righteous! And not only this [i.e., not only one who leaves an executed man hanging overnight transgresses], but whoever leaves his dead one (unburied) overnight transgresses a negative commandment. If he left him overnight for his honor, to bring a casket or shrouds for him, he does not transgress. And they would not bury him (one executed by beth-din) in the crypts of his forefathers, [for an evildoer is not buried next to a righteous man], but there were two burial grounds allotted to beth-din, one for those killed by the sword or by strangulation, and the other, for those killed by stoning or burning. [For one who was liable to a very severe death is not buried next to one who was liable to a lesser one. It is a received law: two, and not four.]",
            "\tWhen the flesh decays [and he has already received atonement through his death and debasement], the bones are gathered and buried in their place [in the ancestral crypts], and the kin (of the deceased) come and solicit the well-being of the judges and of the witnesses, viz.: \"We have nothing in our hearts against you, for you judged a righteous judgment.\" And they would not mourn them (publicly), [so that their debasement be an atonement for them. Others say: Because mourning (aveiluth) obtains when the grave is closed with the top-stone, and at that time they are not mourned, for their atonement is not complete until the flesh is decayed; and since mourning was pushed off, it remains so.] But they would lament them, for \"lamentation\" (aninuth) is in the heart alone."

[Stoning is more severe than burning, and both, than decapitation; and the three of them (are more severe) than strangulation. This is of significance where one is liable to two death penalties, the ruling being that he incurs the more severe.] R. Shimon says: Burning, stoning, strangulation, and decapitation. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.] This [(the foregoing)] is execution by stoning.",
            "\tExecution by burning: They would steep him in refuse until his thighs [so that he not turn back and forth and the brand fall on his flesh.] They would place a hard cloth into a soft one and tie it around his throat, [the hard one to choke him; the soft one, to shield.] One would pull on one end; another, on the other, until he opened his mouth. Then he (another) would take the [leaden] brand and drop it into his mouth. It would descend to his innards and burn out (chomereth) his intestines, [as in (Eichah 2:11): \"My intestines have been burned out\" (chamarmaru). This is derived from the death of the sons of Aaron, viz. (Leviticus 10:6): \"And let your brothers, the entire house of Israel, bewail the burning which the L rd has burned,\" where their bodies were not burned, viz. (Ibid. 5): \"And they drew near and they carried them in their tunics.\" Here, too, the mitzvah of burning is satisfied even though their innards alone are burned. And this (form of burning) is preferred, it being written (Leviticus 19:18): \"And you shall love your neighbor as yourself\" — Choose a humane death for him.] R. Yehudah says: But if he died by their hands [i.e., by strangulation, before the dropping of the brand], they would not have performed the mitzvah of burning! Rather, [they do not choke him, but] they force his mouth open with tongs, kindle a brand, and throw it into his mouth. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] R. Elazar b. R. Tzaddok said: But once the daughter of a priest committed adultery and they encircled her with twigs and burned her alive! They answered: That beth-din was not versed in the law. [They were Sadducees, who do not expound identities (gezeirah shavah), but who interpret the verse literally.]",
            "\tExecution by decapitation: They would cut off his head with a sword, in the manner of (execution by) the monarchy. R. Yehudah says: This is degrading. [For he is killed standing and he falls.] Rather, his head is placed on a block and it is chopped off with a hatchet. [The baraitha explains that R. Yehudah disagrees with the rabbis by reason of (Leviticus 18:3): \"And in their statutes you shall not walk.\" And the rabbis counter: Since death by the sword is alluded to in the Torah, viz. (Exodus 21:20): \"Vengeance shall be taken,\" they (their statutes) are not our source. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] Execution by strangulation: They would steep him in refuse until his thighs, place a hard cloth in a soft one, and tie it around his throat; and one pulled from one end, and another from the other, until he died.]",
            "\tThese are the ones executed by stoning: [Stoning is explicitly stated in respect to some; and where it is not stated, it is written \"His blood is in him,\" \"Their blood is in them,\" which alludes to stoning. The halachah is derived from what is stated in respect to necromancers and soothsayers (Leviticus 20:27): \"With stones shall they stone them; their blood is in them.\"] a man who lives with his mother, with his father's wife, with his daughter-in-law, with a male, and with a beast; a woman who brings a beast upon herself, a blasphemer, an idolator, one who gives of his seed to the Molech [This tanna holds that Molech is not idolatry, but a gentile practice, the two (idolatry and Molech) being separately adduced], Ba'al Ov and yidoni (see 7:7), one who desecrates the Sabbath, one who curses his father and his mother [This is more severe than striking them, two (sins) obtaining: shaming one's father and mother and uttering the L rd's name in vain, it being ruled that he is not liable until he curses them with the Name], one who lives with a betrothed maiden, one who turns [an individual] astray (to idolatry), one who turns [a city] astray, a witch, [viz. (Exodus 22:17): \"A witch you shall not allow to live,\" followed by (Ibid. 18): \"Anyone who lies with  beast shall be put to death.\" Just as there, stoning is indicated, here, too, stoning (is understood)], and a rebellious son (ben sorer umoreh). One who lives with his mother is liable on the count of his mother and on the count of his father's wife. [He is liable for two sin-offerings — kareth (cutting-off) and discreteness of sin-offering (even in one body) being stated in respect to all of the arayoth (illicit relations)]. R. Yehudah says: He is liable only on the count of his mother alone. One who lives with his father's wife is liable on the count of his father's wife and on the count of another man's wife, whether in his father's lifetime or after his death, whether she were betrothed or married. [(\"whether she were betrothed\":) For once he betroths her, she is regarded as his wife, viz. \"If a man takes a wife.\" From the time of \"taking,\" she is called his wife. This \"taking\" is betrothal, as is derived by identity, \"taking\" - \"taking,\" from the field of Efron (Genesis 23:13)]. One who lives with his daughter-in-law is liable on the count of his daughter-in-law and on the count of another man's wife, whether in his son's lifetime or after his death, whether she were betrothed or married. A man who lives with a male or with a beast, and a woman who brings a beast upon her: If the man sinned, how has the beast sinned? But because a man was \"undone\" by it, Scripture commands that it be stoned. Another interpretation: So that the beast not walk through the marketplace and people say: \"This is the one for which that man was stoned.\"",

Yehoshua b. Karchah said: The entire day [of deliberation] they would examine the witnesses (to blaspheming) with an epithet (kinui) [A \"substitute object\" of a curse is called \"kinui\" by the sages; and, in Scripture (Job 32:22): \"Ki loyadati achaneh\" (\"For I know now how to mince words.\")] — \"May Yossi smite Yossi.\" [I have heard that the Tetragrammaton is alluded to by \"Yossi\" for it (Yossi) has four letters, the gematria of which (86) is \"Elokim.\"] When the judgment was concluded [and beth-din came to pronounce him liableb], they could not execute him [on the basis of the testimony that they heard, for they had heard from their mouths only a curse] by epithet.] But everyone is sent out, [it being demeaning to utter a \"blessing of the Name\" in public], and they ask the senior witness (what he heard) and say to him: \"Repeat what you heard explicitly,\" and he does so. And the judges stand upon their feet, and they rend (their garments) and do not resew them [in a \"finished\" manner, with Alexandrine stitching, where the rent is not noticeable; but other stitching is permitted.], and the second witness says: \"I, too, heard as he did.\" [and he need not repeat it explicitly], and the third says: \"I, too, heard as he did.\" [This is in accordance with the view that just as two (witnesses) constitute one testimony, so do three.]",

And with all other modes, he is not liable unless it be the usual one.)], taking it upon oneself as a god, [even by speech alone, this being likened to slaughtering, viz. (Exodus 32:8): \"And they slaughtered to it and said: 'This is your god, etc.'\"], and saying to it: \"You are my god\" [before it. This \"sheds light\" on what precedes. For if we learned the former alone, we would think that one were liable (for worship) only before it, but not otherwise. We, therefore, learn the latter — \"before it\" — implying that the former (speaks of worship) not before it, in spite of which he is liable.] But if one embraces it, kisses it, sweeps before it, sprinkles before it, washes it, anoints it, clothes it, or shods it, he transgresses a negative commandment, [there being a superfluous \"and you shall not serve them\" (to this end.)] If one vows in its name [e.g., \"I forbid to myself all the fruits in the world in the name of that idolatry\"], or if one swears in its name, he transgresses a negative commandment, [viz. (Exodus 23:13): \"And the names of other gods you shall not mention.\" If one defecates before Ba'al Peor, this is its conventional mode of worship, [so that even if his intent were to shame it, he is liable for a sin-offering.] If one casts a stone at Markulis, this is its conventional mode of worship. [And one who removes a stone from before it is also liable, it being served in this fashion, too.

[(\"yidoni\":) an animal called \"yidoa,\" whose face, arms, and legs are like those of a man. It is tied by a cord from its navel to a root in the ground, which gives it life. In hunting it, they shoot arrows at the cord until it is severed and it dies immediately. In the language of the sages it is called \"the man of the mountain.\"] And one who inquires of them [to inform him of the future (as in the instance of Saul)] is in violation of an exhortation, [viz.

(Leviticus 20:14): \"and if a man takes a woman and her mother … in fire shall they be burned,\" and all the others are derived from this)] (are) his daughter [from his \"ravished one,\" who is not the daughter of his wife, for whom he is liable by reason of \"his wife's daughter\"], the daughter of his daughter or the daughter of his son [from his ravished one], his wife's daughter, [whether she be his daughter or his stepdaughter], her daughter's daughter or her son's daughter, and his mother-in-law.

A murderer: If one struck his neighbor with stone or iron, or pressed him down in water or fire, so that he could not rise [e.g., if he held his head underwater so that he could not raise it], and he died, he is liable. If he pressed him into water or fire, but he could have escaped, he is not liable. If he incited a dog or a snake against him, he is not liable. If he caused a snake to bite him, [i.e., if he held a snake in his hand and placed its teeth against another's body], R. Yehudah rules him liable [He holds that a snake's venom is in its teeth, so that when he places its teeth against one's body, it is as if he kills him, and he is liable], and the sages rule him not liable. [They hold that the snake brings up its venom of itself, so that it is not as if the man killed him directly but only indirectly, and he is not liable. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] If one struck his neighbor, whether with a stone or with his fist, and they predicted that he would die, [(but if they predicted that he would live, even the rabbis hold that he is not liable)], and his condition improved, [whereupon they predicted that he would live], and then it worsened and he died, he is liable. R. Nechemiah says that he is not liable, for there are indications [that he did not die because of this blow.]",

If his intent were to strike him a non lethal blow on his hips, and it went to his heart, where it was lethal, and he died, he is not liable. [For both must be satisfied: that he intend to kill and that the blow be sufficient to kill.] If his intent were to strike him a lethal blow on his heart, where it would be lethal, and it went to his hips, where it was not sufficient to kill, and he died, he is not liable. If his intent were to strike an adult, but the blow would not suffice to do so, and it went to a child, where it would suffice, and he died, he is not liable. If his intent were to strike a child, and the blow would suffice to kill him, and it went to an adult, whom it would not suffice to kill, and he died, he is not liable. But if his intent were to strike one on his hips, where the blow would suffice to kill him, and it went to his heart and he died, he is liable. If his intent were to strike an adult, whom the blow would suffice to kill, and it went to a child, who died, he is liable. R. Shimon says: Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, he is not liable. [This does not refer to the latter statement of the first tanna, viz.: \"If his intent were to strike an adult, whom the blow would suffice to kill, and it went to a child, who died, he is liable\"; for if it did, it should simply have been stated: \"R. Shimon says that he is not liable.\" And why repeat: \"Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, etc.\"? The first tanna states this explicitly. Why the \"Even\"? R. Shimon, rather, refers to the first statement, viz.: \"If one's intent were to kill a beast and he killed a man, he is not liable,\" the implication being that if it were his intent to kill a man and he killed another man, he is liable. It is in this regard that R. Shimon says: \"Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, he is not liable.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon.]",

And even if one of them were known for saintliness, so that it is certain that he did not shoot the arrow, still, the other is not made liable on this presumption.] R. Yehudah says: They are incarcerated. [Our Mishnah is defective. It was taught thus: \"And if an ox whose judgment (for killing a man) were pronounced became intermixed with other oxen, they are all stoned.\" For, perforce, it is forbidden to derive benefit from all of them — even if they were a thousand — because of the one intermixed with them. Therefore, they are all stoned, so that the mitzvah of stoning be satisfied with the one liable to it.] R. Yehudah says: They are incarcerated. It is not necessary to stone them, but they are all gathered into a room and they die of hunger. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] All those liable to judicial death penalty who became intermixed with one another are given the lesser penalty. If men sentenced to be stoned became intermixed with others sentenced to be burned, R. Shimon says: They are stoned, for burning is more severe. The sages say: They are burned, for stoning is more severe. R. Shimon said to them: \"If burning were not more severe, it would not be administered to a Cohein's daughter who committed adultery.\" They said to him: If stoning were not more severe, it would not be administered to a blasphemer and an idolator!\" If men sentenced to decapitation became intermixed with others sentenced to strangulation, R. Shimon says (they are to be decapitated) with the sword, [strangulation being more severe.] The sages say: They are to be strangled, [decapitation begin more severe].",

[i.e., If one committed a lesser (capital) transgression, and the verdict were reached on that, and then he committed a more severe (capital) transgression, I might think that since the verdict had been reached for the lesser transgression, he is a \"killed man\"; we are, therefore apprised otherwise.] If he committed a transgression punishable by two judicial death penalties, [e.g., If he lived with his mother-in-law, another man's wife], he is given the more severe, [i.e., burning, by reason of mother-in-law, and not strangulation by reason of another man's wife.] R. Yossi says: He is judged according to the first relationship [that he must shun, and not according to the latter, even if it is more severe. For R. Yossi holds that one prohibition does not \"take\" upon another, even one that is more severe upon one that is less severe. So that if he wed the daughter of a widow, who was first his mother-in-law when she was single, and then she married, he is sentenced to burning (if he lives with her). And if she were married and then she became his mother-in-law, he is sentenced to strangulation, the penalty for living with a married woman, which she was first (before she became his mother-in-law).

If one kills someone without witnesses, [i.e., in the absence of testimony that would make him liable to the death penalty — though it is known to beth-din that it is true, that he certainly killed; but the witnesses were refuted in cross-examination or sufficient warning was lacking], they place him in a cell and feed him scant bread and \"water of distress\" [first, and then they feed him barley until his stomach bursts.

[Those who are zealous for the honor of the L rd would slay him. This, if the woman is the daughter of idolators, (if it be) in the midst of the act, and in the presence of ten Jews. In the absence of one of these conditions, it is forbidden to kill him. But his punishment is stated by the prophet (Malachi 2:12): \"The L rd will cut off from the man that commits this, etc.\" And he is given stripes four times by ordinance of the scribes: by reason of (cohabiting with) a niddah, by reason of a bondswoman, by reason of an idolatress, and by reason of a harlot.] If a Cohein officiates in a state of uncleanliness, his fellow Cohanim do not bring him to beth-din but the pirchei kehunah (the young priests) [whose beards have begun to sprout (lifroach)] take him outside of the azarah (the Temple court) and split his skull with clubs. If a zar (a non-priest) officiates in the Temple, R. Akiva says: (His death is) by strangulation, [it being written here (Numbers 18:7): \"And the stranger who draws near shall be put to death,\" and elsewhere (Deuteronomy 13:6): \"And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death.\" Just as there, by strangulation, here, too, by strangulation.] And the sages say: (His death is) at the hands of Heaven, [it being written here: \"He shall be put to death,\" and, elsewhere (Numbers 17:28): \"Everyone who draws near the tabernacle of the L rd must die.\" Just as there, at the hands of Heaven, here, too, at the hands of Heaven. The halachah is in accordance with the sages. Death at the hands of Heaven is less severe than kareth. For with kareth, one bears transgression after death if he did not repent adequately, whereas with death at the hands of Heaven, he bears nothing after death. Rashi writes in Shabbath (25a) that with death at the hands of Heaven, his days are shortened, but he does not go childless, whereas with kareth, both obtain: his days are cut off and he goes childless. Those liable to death at the hands of Heaven for (abuse of) the sanctuary and of sanctified objects are eleven: one who eats tevel (untithed produce), an unclean Cohein who eats clean terumah, a non-priest who eats terumah, a non-priest, an unclean (priest), and a tvul yom (one who immersed in the daytime and did not wait until sunset) who officiates, one lacking atonement, one lacking (the full complement of priestly) garments, one who did not lave his hands and feet, one who is drunk, and one with disheveled hair. Death is explicitly mentioned in respect to some, and some are derived by our rabbis (as subject to death) through the tradition by identity (gezeirah shavah) or by comparison (hekesh)]."

Yehudah says: Until he brings him into his domain and makes use of him, it being written (Deuteronomy 24:7): \"and he makes use of him and sells him.\" [\"use\" worth a perutah. And the first tanna rules him liable for \"use\" of even less than a perutah. The halachah is in accordance with the first tanna.] If one steals his son, R. Yishmael b. R. Yochanan b. B'roka rules him liable. The sages rule him not liable. [The rationale of the rabbis: It is written (Exodus 21:16): \"and he be found in his hand\" — a superfluous verse, for it is written (Deuteronomy 24:7): \"If there be found a man, etc.\" — to teach us: to exclude one who is already \"found\" (i.e., his son)]. If one steals a man who is half bondsman - half free, R. Yehudah rules him liable, and the sages, not liable. [(\"R. Yehudah rules him liable\":) it being written (Deuteronomy 24:7): \"of his brothers of the children of Israel\": \"of his brothers\" — to exclude bondsmen; \"of the children of Israel\": If it were written \"the children of Israel,\" we would exclude one who was half bondsman - half free. Now that it is written: \"of the children of Israel,\" this is an additional exclusion; \"and there is no exclusion after exclusion except for inclusion.\" And the rabbis hold that \"of his brothers\" does not exclude bondsmen, for they are his \"brothers\" in mitzvoth. Rather, \"the children of Israel\" — to exclude bondsmen; \"of the children of Israel\" — to exclude one who is half bondsman - half free. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]",
            "\tAn elder who rebels against beth-din (is put to death by strangulation), viz. (Deuteronomy 17:8): \"If there be hidden from you a thing of judgment, etc.\" There were three batei-din there [in Jerusalem, concerning which it is written (Ibid.): \"Then you shall arise and go up.\"], one at the entrance to the Temple mount, [the eastern gate, inside the Chel (a place within the fortification of the Temple), before the ezrath nashim (the women's compartment)], one at the entrance of the azarah (the Temple court) [above it, as they crossed the ezrath nashim and came to the entrance of the ezrath Yisrael], and one in the chamber of hewn stone, [built in the midst of the azarah, part in sanctified ground, part in non-sanctified.] They come to the one at the entrance to the Temple mount, [(this elder who ruled in his city and with whom the beth-din in his city differed, Scripture requiring them to come up to Jerusalem.) He and the beth-din of his city come up to this beth-din at the entrance to the Temple mount, arriving there first.], and he says: \"Thus did I expound. Thus and thus did my colleagues expound. Thus did I teach. Thus and thus did my colleagues teach.\" If they (that beth-din) had heard it (the halachah in that matter), they tell them, and if not they come to those at the entrance of the azarah. He says: \"Thus did I expound, and thus did my colleagues expound. Thus did I teach, and thus did my colleagues teach.\" If they had heard, they tell them. And if not, these and the others come to the great beth-din in the chamber of hewn stone, whence Torah goes out to all of Israel, viz. (Deuteronomy 17:10): \"…from that place which the L rd chooses.\" If he returned to his city and he ruled again as he had ruled before, he is not liable. And if he ruled \"to do,\" he is liable, it being written (Ibid. 12): \"And the man who shall do willfully\" — he is not liable until he rules to do. A disciple who rules to do is not liable. [A disciple who had not attained to (expertise in) ruling and the beth-din in his city differed with him — If they came to the great beth-din and inquired, and he returned to his city and ruled as at first, he is not liable, for they should not have relied upon his ruling. The Torah made liable only an expert of beth-din, as is derived from (Ibid. 8): \"If there be hidden (ki yipalei) from you.\" Scripture speaks of an expert (muflah) of beth-din.] His severity, then, is found to be his lenity! [The severity of his transgression — ruling though he is not qualified to rule, compounded with his rebelling against beth-din — becomes his lenity, exempting him from the death penalty. For if he were an elder qualified to rule and he rebelled against beth-din, he would be put to death.]",
            "\tA stringency of the words of the scribes over the words of the Torah: If one says that there are no tefillin, in transgression of the words of the Torah, he is not liable, [this not being \"ruling.\" For he is told (as it were): \"Go and learn!\"] (But if one says that) there are five frontlets (totafoth), adding to the words of the scribes, he is liable, [this constituting a ruling. And even though this only adds to the words of the scribes, he is liable. For in the medrash of the scribes it is written: The word \"letotafoth\" is written three times (Exodus 13:16, Deuteronomy 6:8, and Deuteronomy 11:18), twice defective and once plene, giving a total of four sections (in the head phylactery)].",
            "\tHe (a rebellious elder) is executed neither by the beth-din of his city nor by the beth-din in Yavneh [If they inquired of the beth-din in the chamber of hewn stone, and they ruled for him, and he returned to his city and remained there many days, until the great Sanhedrin was exiled to Yavneh, and then he ruled as at first, he is not executed in Yavneh, even though the great Sanhedrin is there, and even if the Temple still stands, the great Sanhedrin not sitting in its place in the chamber of hewn stone.], but he is brought up to the great beth-din in Jerusalem and kept there until the festival, it being written (Deuteronomy 17:13): \"And all the people shall hear and fear and not presume again.\" These are the words of R. Akiva. R. Yehudah says: His judgment is not delayed, but he is executed immediately, and it is written, and messengers are sent (to proclaim) in all places: \"This man, the son of this man, was found liable to the death penalty by beth-din.\"",
            "\tA false prophet — one who prophesies what he did not hear [i.e., what was not stated in prophecy to any prophet], and what was not said to him, [but to his colleague, from whom he heard it, and he came and said that it was said to him] — his death is at the hands of man. [Both of these are false prophets, and their death is by strangulation, it being written (Deuteronomy 18:20): \"But the prophet who shall presume to speak a thing in My name\" — this is one who prophesies what he never heard — \"which I did not command him\" — but which I commanded to his neighbor. This is one who prophesies what was not said to him but which was said to his neighbor — \"that prophet shall be put to death\"; and every death mentioned in the Torah, unqualified, is strangulation.] But if one suppresses his prophecy, or makes light of the words of a prophet, or transgresses his own prophecy, his death is at the hands of Heaven, it being written (Ibid. 19): \"I shall require it of him.\" [It is written (Ibid. 19): \"And it shall be, the man who shall not heed (lo yishma) My words.\" It can be read \"lo yishma\" (i.e., another) \"will not heed,\" and \"lo yashmia\" \"he will not make heard,\" and \"lo yishmah,\" i.e., he himself \"will not heed,\" so that all three are included, followed by \"I shall require it of him\" — at the hands of Heaven.]",
            "\tOne who prophesies in the name of idolatry, saying: \"Thus did this idolatry say\" (is put to death by strangulation), even if he (i.e., what he said) coincided with the halachah, to declare the unclean unclean, and the clean, clean. One who lives with a married woman, once she enters the groom's domain for marriage, [as when the father hands her over to the groom's messengers and she is still on the way to him, in which instance she is no longer regarded as being in \"her father's house\"], is put to death by strangulation. And the zomemin of the daughter of a Cohein and her consort (are put to death by strangulation). For all zomemin \"come forward\" for that death [that they would make the adjudged liable to], except the zomemin of the daughter of a Cohein and her consort [i.e., All who live (illicitly) with a woman are subject to the same death as she, except for the consort of the daughter of a Cohein, she being subject to burning, and he, to strangulation.]"
