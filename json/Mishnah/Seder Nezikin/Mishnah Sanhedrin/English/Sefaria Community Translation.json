            "Cross-examination of [witnesses] [occurs] in both monetary cases and capital cases, as it says, (Leviticus 24:22) \"You shall have one [i.e. the same] law.\" What is the difference between monetary cases and capital cases? Monetary cases [are tried] by three [judges], whereas capital cases by twenty-three. Monetary cases commence either [with arguments] to acquit or to render liable; whereas capital cases commence [with arguments] to acquit, but do not commence [with arguments] to convict. Monetary cases are decided by [a majority of] one, whether to acquit or to render liable; whereas capital cases are decided by [a majority of] one to acquit, but by [a majority of] two to convict. [In] monetary cases, [the verdict] may be reversed, whether to acquit or to render liable; whereas [in] capital cases, [the verdict] may be reversed to acquit, but may not be reversed to convict. [In] monetary cases, all may offer arguments to acquit or to render liable; [whereas in] capital cases, all may offer arguments to acquit, but not all may offer arguments to convict. [In] monetary cases, one who has offered an argument to render liable may [subsequently] offer an argument to acquit, and one who has offered an argument to acquit may [subsequently] offer an argument to render liable; whereas in capital cases, one who has offered an argument to convict may [subsequently] offer an argument to acquit, but one who has offered an argument to acquit may not retract [and subsequently] offer an argument to convict.  Monetary cases are tried in the day and may be completed at night; whereas capital cases are tried in the day and must be completed during the day. Monetary cases are completed on the same day [as they were started], whether to acquit or to render liable; whereas capital cases may be completed on the same day [as they were started] [if the verdict is] to acquit, but [must be completed] on the next day [if the verdict is] to convict. Therefore, [cases] are not tried on the eve of the Sabbath nor on the eve of a festival.",
            "Cases of impurity and purity begin [with arguments] from the greatest [judge]; [whereas] capital cases begin with [with arguments] from [the judges seated] on the side. Everyone is acceptable [i.e. qualified] to judge monetary cases, whereas not everyone is acceptable [i.e. qualified] to judge capital cases. Rather, [only] priests, Levites, and [ordinary] Jews whose daughters may marry into the priesthood [are qualified to judge].",
            "The Sanhedrin was [organized in the shape of a] semi-circular granary, so that every [judge] could see one another. Two court scribes stand before them, one on the right and one on the left, and they write the words of [judges arguing to] acquit and the words of [judges arguing to] convict. Rabbi Yehudah says, [there were] three; one writing the words of the [judges arguing to] acquit, one writing the words of the [judges arguing to] convict, and the third writing the words of [both] [the judges arguing to] acquit and words of the [judges arguing to] convict.",
            "And three rows of students sit before them, each recognizing his [proper] place. [When] they need to appoint [a new judge], they appoint [a student] from the first [row]. One [student] from the second [row] comes [i.e. moves up] to the first, and one [student] from the third [row] comes [i.e. moves up] to the second; and they select one more [student] from the community and seat him in the third [row]. He would not sit in the place of the original [student, whom he had replaced], but rather sits in the place appropriate for him.",
            "How do they instill fear [into the witnesses] in capital cases? They would bring them in and instill fear in them, [saying:] Lest you [offer testimony that includes] inductive inference, rumor, [information heard] from another witness, [or claim,] 'we heard [this] from a trustworthy individual,' or lest you did not know that we will interrogate you with cross-examination; you should know that capital cases are unlike monetary cases. [In] monetary cases, an individual  pays money and attains atonement. [However, in] capital cases, [the accused's] blood and the blood of his [potential] offspring until eternity are dependent on [the case's outcome]. For thus do we find with respect to Cain, who killed his brother, as it says, (Genesis 4:10) \"the bloods of your brother call out\"; it does not say \"the blood of your brother,\" but rather \"the bloods of your brother\"- his blood and the blood of his [potential] offspring. Another explanation [of the plural form]: \"the bloods of your brother\"- for his blood was splattered cast upon the trees and rocks. It was for this reason that man was created unique, to teach you that anyone who destroys one life from the Jewish people is considered by Scripture to have destroyed an entire world; and anyone who saves one life from the Jewish people is as if he saved an entire world. And also, to promote peace among people, that no one will say to his fellow, \"My ancestors are greater than yours.\" And also, so that sectarians will not say, \"There are many powers in Heaven.\" And also, to express the grandeur of The Holy One blessed be He: For a man strikes many coins from the same die, and all the coins are alike; whereas the King, the King of Kings, The Holy One blessed be He struck every man from the die of the First Man [Adam], and yet no man is quite like his fellow. Therefore, every person is obligated to say, \"For me the world was created.\" And lest you say, \"Why must we go through all this trouble?\" has it not already been said (Leviticus 5:1), \"he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he do not utter it, etc.\" And lest you say, \"Why must we [testify and thereby] be responsible for the [loss] of this person's life? has it not already been said, (Proverbs 11:10) \"And when the wicked perish, there is joy.\""

            "Once the verdict is reached, they bring him out to stone him. The stoning area was outside the courthouse, as it says, (Leviticus 24:14) \"Bring out he who has cursed.\" One would stand before the entrance to the courthouse, his scarf in his hand; and another would ride on a horse before them at a distance, in order to see him. [If] one says, \"I have an argument for acquittal,\" then he waves the scarf, and the horse runs to stop him. And even if [the accused] says, \"I have an argument for my [own] acquittal,\" then he is returned; and this may happen even four or five times, so long as there is substance to his words. If he is acquitted, he is dismissed; and if not, he is brought out to be stoned. And an announcer comes out before him and announces, \"So-and-so son of so-and-so is being brought out to be stoned for having committed such-and-such transgression, and so-and-so and so-and-so are his witnesses. Anyone who has any knowledge as to his innocence should come and argue for him.\"",
            "[Once the accused] was about ten cubit from the stoning area, they say to him, \"Confess,\" for such is the way of those sentenced to death to confess, for all who confess have a share in the World to Come. For thus we find with respect to Achan, to whom Joshua said, (Joshua 7:19) \"'My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and make confession unto Him.'... And Achan answered Joshua, and said: 'Of a truth I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel.'\" And from where [do we know] that his confession atoned for him? As it says, (Joshua 7:25), \"And Joshua said: 'Why hast thou troubled us? the Lord shall trouble thee this day,'\" today you are troubled, but you are not troubled in the World to Come. And if he does not know how to confess, they say to him: \"Say, 'May my death serve as an atonement for all my iniquities.'\" Rabbi Yehudah says, if he knows he was [convicted by] false testimony, he says, \"May my death serve as an atonement for all my iniquities, excepting this iniquity.\" [The Sages] said to him, if so, all [sentenced to death] will say this in order to cleanse themselves [i.e. clear their name].",
            "[Once] he was four cubits from the stoning area, they remove his clothing. [If it is] a man, his front is covered; [if it is] a woman, her front and her back are covered, according to Rabbi Yehudah. But the Sages say, a man is stoned naked, but a woman is not stoned naked.",
            "The stoning area's height was that of two men. One of the witnesses pushes him on his loins. If he is turned on his heart, they turn him [over,] on his loins. If he dies from this, [the court] has discharged [its obligation].  If not, the second [witness] picks up the stone and puts it on his heart. If he dies from this, [the court] has discharged [its obligation]. If not, he is pelted with stones by all of Israel, as it says, (Deuteronomy 17:7) \"The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.\" All who are stoned are hanged, according to Rabbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, the only [offenders] who are hanged are the blasphemer and the idolator. A man is hanged with his face toward the people, and a woman with her face toward the gallows, according to Rabbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, a man is hanged, but a woman is not hanged.  Rabbi Eliezer said to them, Did Shimon ben Shetach not hang women in Ashkelon?  They said to him, he hanged eighty women, and we do not [even] judge two [capital cases] in one day! How do they hang him?  They sink the beam into the ground, and [a piece of] wood protrudes from it, and one places his hands together, and hangs him. Rabbi Yose says, the beam leans on a wall, and they hang him the way that butchers do. And then they undo him [from the gallows] immediately. If he stayed there overnight, [the court] violates a negative commandment on his account, as it says, (Deuteronomy 21:23), \"His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a reproach unto God....\" That is to say: why has he been hanged?  Because he 'blessed' [i.e. cursed] God, and God's name has become desecrated.",
            "Said Rabbi Meir, when a human being is in distress, what expression does the Divine Presence use, as it were? \"My head is in pain, My arm is in pain.\" If so, the Omnipresent feels distress over the blood of the wicked that is spilled; how much more so [does He] over the blood of the righteous. And furthermore, anyone who leaves a dead body hanging overnight transgresses a negative commandment. But if one leaves a body hanging overnight for the sake of its honor, to bring it a coffin or shroud, he does not transgress [a negative commandment]. And such a body [i.e. that of one stoned to death] would not be buried in the grave of his ancestors. Rather, two grave-sites were set for the courthouse, one for those put to death by decapitation and strangulation, and one for those put to death by stoning and burning.",
            "When the flesh decomposed, they collect the bones and bury them in their proper place.  And the relatives come and greet the judges and the witnesses, as if to say, we hold nothing against you, since [we know that] your verdict was just. And they would not [observe rituals of] mourn[ing], but they would grieve, since grief is only in the heart."

            "Four [forms] of capital punishment were given over to the courts: stoning, burning, decapitation, and strangulation. Rabbi Shimon says, burning, stoning, strangulation, and decapitation. This is the law [i.e. procedure] concerning those to be stoned.",
            "The law [i.e. procedure] concerning those to be burned [is as follows]:  They would set him into manure up to his knees, and put a stiff scarf inside a soft one, and wrap it around his neck. One would pull [one end] towards him and one would pull [the other end] towards him, until he [who was being executed] opened his mouth. Then [one] would light a wick and throw it into his mouth, and it would descend into his bowels and burn his entrails.  Rabbi Yehudah says, if he died by their hands [e.g. were he strangled by the cloth], they would not have fulfilled the commandment of [execution by] burning; rather [the procedure should be carried out as follows]: they open his mouth with pincers by force, and light the wick, and throw it into his mouth, and it would descend into his bowels and burn his entrails. Rabbi Eliezer ben Tzadok said, there was once a priest's daughter who committed adultery; they placed bundles of branches around her and burned her. The [Sages] said to him, [this happened] because the court at that time was not expert.",
            "The law [i.e. procedure] concerning those to be decapitated [is as follows]: they would cut off his head with a sword as the government does.  Rabbi Yehudah says, this is disgraceful; rather [the procedure should be carried out as follows]: they rest his head on a block and cut it with a hatchet. The [Sages] said to him, there is no death more disgraceful than that. The law [i.e. procedure] concerning those to be strangled [is as follows]: They would set him into manure up to his knees, and put a stiff scarf inside a soft one, and wrap it around his neck. One would pull [one end] towards him and one would pull [the other end] towards him, until his soul departed.",
            "These are [executed by] stoning: [a male] who sleeps with his mother, with the wife of his father, with his daughter-in-law, with a male, [or] with an animal; a woman who causes an animal to sleep with her; the blasphemer; the idolater; one who gives of his children to <i>Molekh</i> [a particular form of idolatry], the <i>ba'al 'ov</i> [necromancer]  and <i>yid'oni</i> [soothsayer]; one who desecrates the Sabbath; one who curses his father or mother; one who sleeps with a betrothed maiden; the <i>mesit</i> [one who entices an individual to commit idolatry]; the <i>mediach</i> [one who entices a city to commit idolatry]; the sorcerer; and the wayward and rebellious son. One who sleeps with his mother - [he] is liable [for violating two prohibitions, for the prohibition of sleeping with his] mother and for [the prohibition of sleeping with] his father's wife. Rabbi Yehudah says, he is only liable for [sleeping with] his mother. One who sleeps with his father's wife- [he] is liable for his father's wife and for a married woman, whether [the act occurs] in his father's lifetime or after his father's death, whether [she is his father's wife] through betrothal or through completed marriage. One who sleeps with his daughter-in-law- [he] is liable for his daughter-in-law and for a married woman, whether in his sons's lifetime or after his son's death, whether [she is his son's wife] through betrothal or through completed marriage. One who sleeps with a male or with an animal, or a woman who causes an animal to sleep with her- [even] if a person has sinned, how has the animal sinned [such that it also receives execution by stoning]? Rather, since [the animal] caused a person to commit an offense, Scripture therefore said, [the animal] should be stoned. Another explanation: [the animal is stoned] so that the animal not be passing through the market-place and [lead people to] say, \"This is the one that caused so-and-so to be stoned.\"",
            "The blasphemer - [he] is not liable until he [explicitly] utters the name [of God]. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah said, every day the witnesses testify using a substitute name [in place of the actual Divine Name uttered by the blasphemer]: \"May Yossi smite Yossi.\" Once the verdict has been reached, they would not execute [the defendant] [on the basis of testimony] using a substitute name. Rather, [the judges] send everyone outside, and inquire of the greatest [witness] among them, saying to him: \"State explicitly what you heard,\" and he states [the blasphemy verbatim]. And the judges stand upon their feet and rend [their clothing]. And they may not [ever] mend [the rended clothing]. And the second [witness] says, \"I also [heard] like him,\" and the third [witness] says, \"I also [heard] like him.\"",
            "The idolator - [this includes the following:] one who worships, sacrifices, offers incense, pours libations, bows, accepts it as a god, and one who says to it, \"You are my god.\" But one who embraces, kisses, sweeps, sprinkles, washes, anoints, dresses, or puts shoes on it, [merely] transgresses a negative commandment [that does not warrant capital punishment]. One who takes a vow in its name or takes an oath in its name [merely] transgresses a negative commandment [that does not warrant capital punishment]. One who relieves himself to <i>Ba'al Be'or</i> [is liable, for] such is its worship. One who throws a stone at <i>Merkulis</i> [is liable, for] such is its worship. ",
            "One who gives of his children to <i>Molekh</i> - he is not liable until he gives over [the child] to <i>Molekh</i> and passes [the child] through the fire. [If he] gave over [the child] to <i>Molekh</i>, but did not pass [the child] through the fire; [or he] passed [the child] through the fire, but did not give [the child] over to <i>Molekh</i>, the man is not liable; [for he is not liable] until he gives over [the child] and passes [the child] through the fire. A <i>ba'al 'ov</i>- this is the magician who [causes the dead] to speak from his armpit; a <i>yid'oni</i>- this is the one who [causes the dead] to speak through his own mouth. These are executed by stoning, and one who consults them is [merely liable for] a negative commandment [that does not warrant capital punishment].",
            "One who desecrates the Sabbath- through an act for which a wanton violation renders him liable to spiritual excision, and a violation in error obligates him [to sacrifice] a sin-offering. One who curses his mother or father- he is not liable unless he curses them using the name [of God]. If he curses them using a substitute name, Rabbi Meir [maintains he is] liable, but the Sages exempt him.",
            "One who sleeps with a betrothed maiden- he is not liable unless she is a maiden, a virgin, betrothed, and in her father's household. If two sleep with her, the first is [executed] by stoning, and the second is [executed] by strangulation.",
            "The <i>mesit</i> - this is a layman who entices a layman, saying to him, \"There is a deity in such-and-such place; it eats thus, it drinks thus, it does good thus, it does evil thus.\" [Regarding] all [transgressions  that] incur capital punishment in the Torah, we do not conceal [witnesses to coax the defendant into transgressing], except for this one. If he said [i.e. enticed] to two, they are his witnesses, and they bring him to court and stone him. If he said to one, [the witness] says, \"I have friends who are interested.\" If [the <i>mesit</i>] is cunning and cannot speak before them, they conceal witnesses behind the fence, and [the original witness] says to [the <i>mesit</i>], \"Say [again] what you said to me in seclusion.\" [If] this one [the <i>mesit</i>] says it to him, [the witness] says, \"How can we forsake our God in Heaven and go and worship wood and stone!\" If [the <i>mesit</i>] retracts, all is good [i.e. he is not culpable]. [But] if he says, \"This is our obligation and this is good for us,\" those standing behind the fence bring him to court and stone him. One who says [any of the following is liable as a <i>mesit</i>:], \"I will serve\"; \"I will go and I will serve\"; \"we will go and we will serve\"; \"I will sacrifice\"; \"I will go and I will sacrifice\"; \"we will go and we will sacrifice\"; \"I will offer incense\"; \"I will go and I will offer incense\"; \"we will go and we will offer incense\"; \"I will pour libations\"; \"I will go and I will pour libations\"; \"we will go and we will pour libations,\" \"I will bow\"; \"I will go and I will bow\"; \"we will go and we will bow.\" The <i>mediach</i> - this is one who says, \"We will go and we will worship idols.\"",
            "The sorcerer - if he does an act of sorcery, he is liable, but not one who [merely] tricks the eyes. Rabbi Akiva says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua, two people harvesting cucumbers, one harvests and is liable, while the other harvests and is exempt. The one who [gathers the cucumbers through] an act of sorcery is liable, [while] the one who [gathers cucumbers in the natural manner and merely] tricks the eyes is exempt."

As it says, (Deuteronomy 21:18) \"If a man have a son\": \"a son,\" and not a daughter; \"a son,\" and not a man.

If one of [the parents] had a hand cut off, or was lame, mute, blind, or deaf-mute, he does not become a wayward and rebellious son.

They said to him, if stoning were not the more severe, it would not be given to to the blasphemer and the idolator! [If] those to be decapitated become mixed with those to be strangled, Rabbi Shimon says, [they are to be executed] with a sword [i.e. decapitated]. And the Sages say, by strangulation.",
            "One who is liable for two [forms of] execution is given the more severe. [If] he commits a transgression which incurs two death penalties, he is given given the more severe. Rabbi Yosi says, he is given [the one that accords with] the first obligation that comes upon him [i.e. he is given the form of execution warranted by the first transgression he committed].",
            "One who is lashed [as punishment for a transgression] and then repeats [that transgression], the court puts him in the dome and feeds him barley until his stomach bursts. One who kills someone in the absence of witnesses, they put him in the dome and feed him sparing bread and scant water.",
            "One who steals a <i>kasvah</i> [a vessel for use in the Temple]; one who curses [God] by enchantment; and one who sleeps with an Aramean woman—zealots may attack him. A priest who served while ritually impure, his fellow priests do not bring him to the court. Rather, the young priests take him outside the Temple courtyard, and split his skull with logs. A non-priest who served in the Temple: Rabbi Akiva says, [he is executed] by strangulation; and the Sages say, [his is executed] by Heaven's hands [and not by the court]."

Rabbi Akiva says: also one who reads outside books, and one who whispers [an incantation] over a wound, saying, (Exodus 15:26) “I will bring none of these diseases upon thee that I brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that healeth thee.” Abba Shaul says, also one who utters the Divine Name as it is spelled.",
            "Three kings and four commoners have no share in the World to Come. The three kings are: Jeroboam, Ahab, and Manasseh. Rabbi Yehudah says, Manasseh does have a share in the World to Come, as it says (II Chronicles 33:13), \"And [Manasseh]  prayed unto Him; and He was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom.\" [The Sages] said to him, to his kingdom He brought him back, but He did not bring him back to life in the World to Come.

Rabbi Nechemiah says , neither will stand in judgment, as it says, (Psalms 1:5) \"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.\" \"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment,\" this is the generation of the Flood; \"nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous,\" this is the people of Sodom.

The generation of the wilderness has no share in the World to Come and will not stand in judgment, as it is written, (Numbers 14:35) \"In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die,\" according to Rabbi Akiva.

[If] women or minors led them astray; or they only led a minority [of the city] astray; or the ones leading them stray were from outside [the city]—[those led astray] are [considered as] individuals [who each committed idolatry], and [they consequently] require two witnesses and warnings for every one [for them to be liable for execution by the court].

As it says, \"And you shall burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, unto the Lord thy God.\" Its spoils, not the spoils of Heaven. From here they said: the <i>hekdeshot</i> [property consecrated to the Temple] within it must be redeemed; and the <i>terumot</i> [portions given to the priest] must be allowed to rot; <i>ma'aser sheni</i> [the second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem] and Holy Scriptures should be buried. \"Every whit [<i>kalil</i>], unto the Lord thy God\": Rabbi Shimon says, said God, if you make judgment on a wayward city, I will consider it as if you offered a complete [<i>kalil</i>] burnt-offering before Me. \"And it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again\": you may not make [it even] gardens or orchards, according to Rabbi Yosi Hagalili.
