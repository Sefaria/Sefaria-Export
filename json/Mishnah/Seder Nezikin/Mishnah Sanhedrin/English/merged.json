[Cases of] rape, seduction, and slander [are judged] by three [judges]- these are the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, [a case of] slander [is judged] by twenty-three [judges], because this is a capital case.", 
            "[Cases regarding transgressions punishable by] lashing, by three. In the name of Rabbi Yishmael it was said, by twenty-three. Intercalating the month by three; intercalating the year, by three, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says, They begin with three, deliberate with five, and finish with seven. But if they finish with three, [the year] has been intercalated.",

Fourth year produce or the second tithe with unknown value, by three. [Redemption of] dedications [for the Temple], by three. Valuations of chattel, by three.

The wolf and the lion, the bear and the tiger, the leopard and the snake, are put to death by twenty-three.

It was comprised of 71 scholars who had received the full traditional rabbinical ordination, and its decisions fixed Jewish practice for subsequent generations.][was comprised of] seventy-one [judges], and a small [<i>Sanhedrin</i>] twenty-three [judges]. From where [do we derive] that the great [<i>Sanhedrin</i>] [comprises] seventy-one [judges]? As it says, (Numbers 11:16) \"gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel,\" and Moses [set] over them, behold, [the number of judges adds to] seventy-one. Rabbi Yehudah says: seventy. And from where [do we derive] that a small [<i>Sanhedrin</i>] [comprises] twenty-three [judges]? As it says, (Numbers 35:24-25) \"the assembly shall judge... the assembly shall deliver.\" The assembly judges and the assembly delivers- behold  [the number of judges adds to] twenty. From where [do we derive] that the assembly is ten? As it says, (Numbers 14:27) \"Until when shall I bear this wicked assembly.\" This excludes Joshua and Caleb. And from where [do we derive that we] add three more? This is implied by the [verse], as it says, (Exodus 23:2) \"Do not follow the many to do evil.\" Should I learn to follow them to do good? If so, why does it say (Exodus 23:2) \"Following the many to distort [justice]\" - your following to do good is not like your following to do evil. Following to do good [i.e. acquittal] is by one, following to do evil [i.e. conviction] is by two. Since a court cannot [contain an] even [number of members], we add [to the number of judges] one more- behold this is twenty-three. And how many [inhabitants] must a city have before it may have a <i>Sanhedrin</i>? One hundred and twenty. Rabbi Nechemiah says, two hundred and thirty, [each judge] corresponding to a chief of a group of ten."

These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says, he may not leave from the Temple, as it says, (Leviticus 21:12) \"And from the Temple, he may not leave.\" When he comforts other [mourners], it is the custom that all the people pass by one after one, and the appointed [substitute High Priest] interposes himself between [the High Priest] and the people.

Rabbi Yehudah says, if he wishes to perform <i>chalitzah</i> or marry through Levirate marriage, he is remembered for good [i.e. it is meritorious].

Rabbi Yehudah says, he may amass more, so long as they do not lead his heart astray. Rabbi Shimon says, even one who leads his heart astray he may not marry. If so, why does it say, (Deuteronomy 17:17) \"He may not amass too many wives\"? [This condition applies even if she is] like Abigail. \"He may not amass too many horses\" (Deuteronomy 17:16), only enough for his chariots. \"And excessive silver and gold he may not amass\" (Deuteronomy 17:17), only enough to pay his soldiers' wages. He must write a Torah scroll for himself. [When] he goes to war, he takes it out with him. [When] he enters, he brings it with him. [When] he sits in judgment, it is with him.

Rabbi Yose said, this is the teaching of Rabbi Akiva. But the original teaching [said]: his uncle, and the son of his uncle, all his potential heirs, and anyone related to him at that time. One who used to be related to him but is no longer- behold, he is acceptable.

Then they would send every man outside, but keep the eldest among them and say to him: \"Say how you know that the one owes the other.\" If he says, \"He told me, 'I owe him,'\" or, \"So-and-so told me that he owes him\" - this means nothing. Only if he says, \"In front of us, he told him that he owes him two hundred <i>zuz</i>\" [is his testimony meaningful]. After this, they would bring in the second [witness] and examine him.

[If] they said to him: \"All evidence that you have, bring it here within thirty days.\" If he finds [evidence] within thirty days, it overturns [the previous verdict]. After thirty days, it does not overturn. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what could he have done, for he did not find [evidence] within thirty days, but [only] after thirty days! [If] they said to him, \"Bring witnesses,\" and he says, \"I have no witnesses\"; [or] they say to him, \"Bring evidence,\" and he says, \"I have no evidence\"; and after a time he brings evidence or finds witnesses, behold this means nothing.

Monetary cases are opened either [with arguments] to acquit or to convict, and capital cases open [with arguments] to acquit but do not open [with arguments] to convict. Monetary cases are decided by one either to acquit or to convict; capital cases are decided by one to acquit or by two to convict. In monetary cases, [the verdict] can change between acquittal and conviction; in capital cases [the verdict] can change to acquittal but cannot change to conviction. In monetary cases, all can rule for acquittal or conviction; in capital cases, all can rule for acquittal but all cannot rule for conviction. In monetary cases, one who convicts can acquit and one who acquits can convict; in capital cases, one who convicts can acquit, but one who acquits cannot turn and convict. Monetary cases can be tried in the day and can finish in the night; capital cases are tried in the day and must finish in the day. Monetary cases finish on the same day for either acquittal or conviction; capital cases finish on the same day for acquittal and the next day for conviction, therefore there cannot be trials on Friday evening or the evening before a holiday.",

We bring them in [to the court's chambers] and press them: \"Perhaps what you say [isn't eyewitness testimony] is but your own assessment, or from rumors, or your witnessing an actual witness testify, or your reporting what a trustworthy said. Or perhaps you were unaware that by the end we'd interrogate you, with examination and inquiry. Know that capital cases are not like monetary ones. In monetary cases, [a false witness] can return the money and achieve atonement. But in capital cases, the blood of [the victim [and all his future offspring hang upon you until the end of time. For thus we find in regard to Cain, who killed his brother, \"The bloods of your brother scream out!\" (Genesis 4:10) - the verse does not say blood of your brother, but bloods of your brother, because it was his blood and also the blood of his future offspring [screaming out]! [Another explanation of the verse: for his blood was splattered over the trees and rocks  [there was more than one pool of blood].

But the King, the King of Kings, The Holy One [blessed be He] strikes every man from the die of the First Man, and yet no man is quite like his friend. Therefore, every person must say, “For my sake ‎the world was created.”‎ [The judges' speech continues:] \"Maybe you [the witnesses] will now say, 'What do we need this, and all this anxiety for [let's not come forward even with true testimony]!' But Scripture has already spoken: \"If he be a witness - having seen or known - if he does not express it, he shall bear his sin.\" (Lev. 5:1) Maybe you will now say, 'What do we need this, to be responsible for another man's death?'

If he dies from that, the requirement is satisfied. If not, he is stoned by all of Israel, viz. (Deuteronomy 17:7): \"The hand of the witnesses shall be against him first to kill him, and the hand of all the people afterwards.\" All of those who are stoned are (afterwards) hung up.

Shetach hang up women in Ashkelon?\" They answered: He hung up eighty women, and two are not judged [in one beth-din] in one day.

[It was not rooted in the ground, but one of its ends was on the ground, and the other inclined against the wall. The rationale of R. Yossi: The wood on which he was suspended was buried with him, and the Torah states (Deuteronomy 21:23): \"But bury shall you bury him\" — he who lacks only burying; to exclude that which lacks digging up, uprooting, and burying. And the (rationale of the) rabbis: Digging up is of no import. The Torah excluded only its being rooted from the beginning. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] And he is let down immediately. And if he is allowed to remain there overnight, he (the one who allows it) transgresses a negative commandment, viz. (Deuteronomy 21:23): \"You shall not leave his body overnight on a tree, but bury shall you bury it on that day; for killelath G d is suspended, etc.\" That is, why is this one suspended? Because he \"blessed\" (a euphemism for \"cursed\" - killel) the L rd, so that the name of Heaven is desecrated (by leaving him — a reminder of the curse — hanging there.)", 
            "\tR. Meir says: When a man suffers [punishment because of his transgression], what does it (the Shechinah) say, (as it were) [i.e., How does it utter plaint and grievance over him?] \"Kalani meroshi\" [\"My head is heavy upon me\"], Kalani mizro'i\" [\"My arm is heavy upon me\" (as one who is fatigued;) \"kalani\" = \"I am not 'light'\"] If the L rd is thus aggrieved over the blood of the wicked that is spilled, how much more so over the blood of the righteous! And not only this [i.e., not only one who leaves an executed man hanging overnight transgresses], but whoever leaves his dead one (unburied) overnight transgresses a negative commandment. If he left him overnight for his honor, to bring a casket or shrouds for him, he does not transgress. And they would not bury him (one executed by beth-din) in the crypts of his forefathers, [for an evildoer is not buried next to a righteous man], but there were two burial grounds allotted to beth-din, one for those killed by the sword or by strangulation, and the other, for those killed by stoning or burning. [For one who was liable to a very severe death is not buried next to one who was liable to a lesser one. It is a received law: two, and not four.]", 
            "\tWhen the flesh decays [and he has already received atonement through his death and debasement], the bones are gathered and buried in their place [in the ancestral crypts], and the kin (of the deceased) come and solicit the well-being of the judges and of the witnesses, viz.: \"We have nothing in our hearts against you, for you judged a righteous judgment.\" And they would not mourn them (publicly), [so that their debasement be an atonement for them. Others say: Because mourning (aveiluth) obtains when the grave is closed with the top-stone, and at that time they are not mourned, for their atonement is not complete until the flesh is decayed; and since mourning was pushed off, it remains so.] But they would lament them, for \"lamentation\" (aninuth) is in the heart alone.", 
            "Said Rabbi Meir, when a human being is in distress, what expression does the Divine Presence use, as it were? \"My head is in pain, My arm is in pain.\" If so, the Omnipresent feels distress over the blood of the wicked that is spilled; how much more so [does He] over the blood of the righteous. And furthermore, anyone who leaves a dead body hanging overnight transgresses a negative commandment. But if one leaves a body hanging overnight for the sake of its honor, to bring it a coffin or shroud, he does not transgress [a negative commandment]. And such a body [i.e. that of one stoned to death] would not be buried in the grave of his ancestors. Rather, two grave-sites were set for the courthouse, one for those put to death by decapitation and strangulation, and one for those put to death by stoning and burning.", 
            "When the flesh decomposed, they collect the bones and bury them in their proper place.  And the relatives come and greet the judges and the witnesses, as if to say, we hold nothing against you, since [we know that] your verdict was just. And they would not [observe rituals of] mourn[ing], but they would grieve, since grief is only in the heart."

This is of significance where one is liable to two death penalties, the ruling being that he incurs the more severe.] R. Shimon says: Burning, stoning, strangulation, and decapitation.

Then he (another) would take the [leaden] brand and drop it into his mouth. It would descend to his innards and burn out (chomereth) his intestines, [as in (Eichah 2:11): \"My intestines have been burned out\" (chamarmaru). This is derived from the death of the sons of Aaron, viz. (Leviticus 10:6): \"And let your brothers, the entire house of Israel, bewail the burning which the L rd has burned,\" where their bodies were not burned, viz. (Ibid. 5): \"And they drew near and they carried them in their tunics.\" Here, too, the mitzvah of burning is satisfied even though their innards alone are burned. And this (form of burning) is preferred, it being written (Leviticus 19:18): \"And you shall love your neighbor as yourself\" — Choose a humane death for him.] R. Yehudah says: But if he died by their hands [i.e., by strangulation, before the dropping of the brand], they would not have performed the mitzvah of burning! Rather, [they do not choke him, but] they force his mouth open with tongs, kindle a brand, and throw it into his mouth. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] R. Elazar b. R. Tzaddok said: But once the daughter of a priest committed adultery and they encircled her with twigs and burned her alive! They answered: That beth-din was not versed in the law.

Yehudah disagrees with the rabbis by reason of (Leviticus 18:3): \"And in their statutes you shall not walk.\" And the rabbis counter: Since death by the sword is alluded to in the Torah, viz. (Exodus 21:20): \"Vengeance shall be taken,\" they (their statutes) are not our source.

(Exodus 22:17): \"A witch you shall not allow to live,\" followed by (Ibid. 18): \"Anyone who lies with  beast shall be put to death.\" Just as there, stoning is indicated, here, too, stoning (is understood)], and a rebellious son (ben sorer umoreh). One who lives with his mother is liable on the count of his mother and on the count of his father's wife. [He is liable for two sin-offerings — kareth (cutting-off) and discreteness of sin-offering (even in one body) being stated in respect to all of the arayoth (illicit relations)]. R. Yehudah says: He is liable only on the count of his mother alone. One who lives with his father's wife is liable on the count of his father's wife and on the count of another man's wife, whether in his father's lifetime or after his death, whether she were betrothed or married. [(\"whether she were betrothed\":) For once he betroths her, she is regarded as his wife, viz. \"If a man takes a wife.\" From the time of \"taking,\" she is called his wife. This \"taking\" is betrothal, as is derived by identity, \"taking\" - \"taking,\" from the field of Efron (Genesis 23:13)]. One who lives with his daughter-in-law is liable on the count of his daughter-in-law and on the count of another man's wife, whether in his son's lifetime or after his death, whether she were betrothed or married. A man who lives with a male or with a beast, and a woman who brings a beast upon her: If the man sinned, how has the beast sinned? But because a man was \"undone\" by it, Scripture commands that it be stoned. Another interpretation: So that the beast not walk through the marketplace and people say: \"This is the one for which that man was stoned.\"",

Yehoshua b. Karchah said: The entire day [of deliberation] they would examine the witnesses (to blaspheming) with an epithet (kinui) [A \"substitute object\" of a curse is called \"kinui\" by the sages; and, in Scripture (Job 32:22): \"Ki loyadati achaneh\" (\"For I know now how to mince words.\")] — \"May Yossi smite Yossi.\" [I have heard that the Tetragrammaton is alluded to by \"Yossi\" for it (Yossi) has four letters, the gematria of which (86) is \"Elokim.\"] When the judgment was concluded [and beth-din came to pronounce him liableb], they could not execute him [on the basis of the testimony that they heard, for they had heard from their mouths only a curse] by epithet.] But everyone is sent out, [it being demeaning to utter a \"blessing of the Name\" in public], and they ask the senior witness (what he heard) and say to him: \"Repeat what you heard explicitly,\" and he does so. And the judges stand upon their feet, and they rend (their garments) and do not resew them [in a \"finished\" manner, with Alexandrine stitching, where the rent is not noticeable; but other stitching is permitted.], and the second witness says: \"I, too, heard as he did.\" [and he need not repeat it explicitly], and the third says: \"I, too, heard as he did.\" [This is in accordance with the view that just as two (witnesses) constitute one testimony, so do three.]",

And with all other modes, he is not liable unless it be the usual one.)], taking it upon oneself as a god, [even by speech alone, this being likened to slaughtering, viz. (Exodus 32:8): \"And they slaughtered to it and said: 'This is your god, etc.'\"], and saying to it: \"You are my god\" [before it. This \"sheds light\" on what precedes.

[And one who removes a stone from before it is also liable, it being served in this fashion, too.

In hunting it, they shoot arrows at the cord until it is severed and it dies immediately.

But one pursuing a beast, [though this is similar to arayoth], and one who would desecrate the Sabbath or serve idolatry [though both of these deny the Deity] are not saved (from transgression) by their lives. [And, it goes without saying that the other would-be transgressors who are liable to kareth and judicial death penalties not related to arayoth, are not saved by their lives. It is not permitted to kill them at all until they commit the transgression in the presence of witnesses and become liable to judicial death penalty.]"

[She is also put to death by burning.] Included in \"a woman and her daughter\" [(i.e., burning is explicitly indicated for \"a woman and her daughter,\" viz. (Leviticus 20:14): \"and if a man takes a woman and her mother … in fire shall they be burned,\" and all the others are derived from this)] (are) his daughter [from his \"ravished one,\" who is not the daughter of his wife, for whom he is liable by reason of \"his wife's daughter\"], the daughter of his daughter or the daughter of his son [from his ravished one], his wife's daughter, [whether she be his daughter or his stepdaughter], her daughter's daughter or her son's daughter, and his mother-in-law. [Even though this is taught explicitly above and is not derived from a derashah, since there are taught in this context \"the mother of his mother-in-law\" and \"the mother of his father-in-law,\" which are derived from a derashah, \"his mother-in-law\" is taught in passing, along with them.] And these are the ones who are put to death by the sword: a murderer, and the men of an idolatrous city. A murderer: If one struck his neighbor with stone or iron, or pressed him down in water or fire, so that he could not rise [e.g., if he held his head underwater so that he could not raise it], and he died, he is liable. If he pressed him into water or fire, but he could have escaped, he is not liable. If he incited a dog or a snake against him, he is not liable. If he caused a snake to bite him, [i.e., if he held a snake in his hand and placed its teeth against another's body], R. Yehudah rules him liable [He holds that a snake's venom is in its teeth, so that when he places its teeth against one's body, it is as if he kills him, and he is liable], and the sages rule him not liable. [They hold that the snake brings up its venom of itself, so that it is not as if the man killed him directly but only indirectly, and he is not liable. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] If one struck his neighbor, whether with a stone or with his fist, and they predicted that he would die, [(but if they predicted that he would live, even the rabbis hold that he is not liable)], and his condition improved, [whereupon they predicted that he would live], and then it worsened and he died, he is liable. R. Nechemiah says that he is not liable, for there are indications [that he did not die because of this blow.]", 
            "\tIf one's intent were to kill a beast and he killed a man; a gentile and he killed a Jew; a premature child (who would not survive) and he killed one who would have survived, he is not liable. If his intent were to strike him a non lethal blow on his hips, and it went to his heart, where it was lethal, and he died, he is not liable. [For both must be satisfied: that he intend to kill and that the blow be sufficient to kill.] If his intent were to strike him a lethal blow on his heart, where it would be lethal, and it went to his hips, where it was not sufficient to kill, and he died, he is not liable. If his intent were to strike an adult, but the blow would not suffice to do so, and it went to a child, where it would suffice, and he died, he is not liable. If his intent were to strike a child, and the blow would suffice to kill him, and it went to an adult, whom it would not suffice to kill, and he died, he is not liable. But if his intent were to strike one on his hips, where the blow would suffice to kill him, and it went to his heart and he died, he is liable. If his intent were to strike an adult, whom the blow would suffice to kill, and it went to a child, who died, he is liable. R. Shimon says: Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, he is not liable. [This does not refer to the latter statement of the first tanna, viz.: \"If his intent were to strike an adult, whom the blow would suffice to kill, and it went to a child, who died, he is liable\"; for if it did, it should simply have been stated: \"R. Shimon says that he is not liable.\" And why repeat: \"Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, etc.\"? The first tanna states this explicitly. Why the \"Even\"? R. Shimon, rather, refers to the first statement, viz.: \"If one's intent were to kill a beast and he killed a man, he is not liable,\" the implication being that if it were his intent to kill a man and he killed another man, he is liable. It is in this regard that R. Shimon says: \"Even if his intent were to kill one and he killed another, he is not liable.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon.]", 
            "\tIf a murderer were mixed in with others, all are not liable. [e.g., If two men were standing and an arrow went out from between them and killed someone, both are not liable. And even if one of them were known for saintliness, so that it is certain that he did not shoot the arrow, still, the other is not made liable on this presumption.] R. Yehudah says: They are incarcerated. [Our Mishnah is defective. It was taught thus: \"And if an ox whose judgment (for killing a man) were pronounced became intermixed with other oxen, they are all stoned.\" For, perforce, it is forbidden to derive benefit from all of them — even if they were a thousand — because of the one intermixed with them. Therefore, they are all stoned, so that the mitzvah of stoning be satisfied with the one liable to it.] R. Yehudah says: They are incarcerated. It is not necessary to stone them, but they are all gathered into a room and they die of hunger. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.] All those liable to judicial death penalty who became intermixed with one another are given the lesser penalty. If men sentenced to be stoned became intermixed with others sentenced to be burned, R. Shimon says: They are stoned, for burning is more severe. The sages say: They are burned, for stoning is more severe. R. Shimon said to them: \"If burning were not more severe, it would not be administered to a Cohein's daughter who committed adultery.\" They said to him: If stoning were not more severe, it would not be administered to a blasphemer and an idolator!\" If men sentenced to decapitation became intermixed with others sentenced to strangulation, R. Shimon says (they are to be decapitated) with the sword, [strangulation being more severe.] The sages say: They are to be strangled, [decapitation begin more severe].", 
            "\tIf one were liable to two judicial death penalties, he is given the more severe. [i.e., If one committed a lesser (capital) transgression, and the verdict were reached on that, and then he committed a more severe (capital) transgression, I might think that since the verdict had been reached for the lesser transgression, he is a \"killed man\"; we are, therefore apprised otherwise.] If he committed a transgression punishable by two judicial death penalties, [e.g., If he lived with his mother-in-law, another man's wife], he is given the more severe, [i.e., burning, by reason of mother-in-law, and not strangulation by reason of another man's wife.] R. Yossi says: He is judged according to the first relationship [that he must shun, and not according to the latter, even if it is more severe. For R. Yossi holds that one prohibition does not \"take\" upon another, even one that is more severe upon one that is less severe. So that if he wed the daughter of a widow, who was first his mother-in-law when she was single, and then she married, he is sentenced to burning (if he lives with her). And if she were married and then she became his mother-in-law, he is sentenced to strangulation, the penalty for living with a married woman, which she was first (before she became his mother-in-law). The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yossi.]", 
            "\tIf one were given stripes and repeated, [i.e., if he were given stripes twice for a transgression punishable by kareth (for all who are liable to kareth are given stripes), when he commits the same transgression a third time,] beth-din place him into a cell, [containing the space of a man's stature and not more, and they feed him first scant bread and \"water of distress\" until his intestines shrink] and (then) they feed him barley, which swells his intestines until his stomach bursts. If one kills someone without witnesses, [i.e., in the absence of testimony that would make him liable to the death penalty — though it is known to beth-din that it is true, that he certainly killed; but the witnesses were refuted in cross-examination or sufficient warning was lacking], they place him in a cell and feed him scant bread and \"water of distress\" [first, and then they feed him barley until his stomach bursts.

[Those who are zealous for the honor of the L rd would slay him. This, if the woman is the daughter of idolators, (if it be) in the midst of the act, and in the presence of ten Jews. In the absence of one of these conditions, it is forbidden to kill him. But his punishment is stated by the prophet (Malachi 2:12): \"The L rd will cut off from the man that commits this, etc.\" And he is given stripes four times by ordinance of the scribes: by reason of (cohabiting with) a niddah, by reason of a bondswoman, by reason of an idolatress, and by reason of a harlot.] If a Cohein officiates in a state of uncleanliness, his fellow Cohanim do not bring him to beth-din but the pirchei kehunah (the young priests) [whose beards have begun to sprout (lifroach)] take him outside of the azarah (the Temple court) and split his skull with clubs. If a zar (a non-priest) officiates in the Temple, R. Akiva says: (His death is) by strangulation, [it being written here (Numbers 18:7): \"And the stranger who draws near shall be put to death,\" and elsewhere (Deuteronomy 13:6): \"And that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death.\" Just as there, by strangulation, here, too, by strangulation.] And the sages say: (His death is) at the hands of Heaven, [it being written here: \"He shall be put to death,\" and, elsewhere (Numbers 17:28): \"Everyone who draws near the tabernacle of the L rd must die.\" Just as there, at the hands of Heaven, here, too, at the hands of Heaven. The halachah is in accordance with the sages. Death at the hands of Heaven is less severe than kareth. For with kareth, one bears transgression after death if he did not repent adequately, whereas with death at the hands of Heaven, he bears nothing after death. Rashi writes in Shabbath (25a) that with death at the hands of Heaven, his days are shortened, but he does not go childless, whereas with kareth, both obtain: his days are cut off and he goes childless. Those liable to death at the hands of Heaven for (abuse of) the sanctuary and of sanctified objects are eleven: one who eats tevel (untithed produce), an unclean Cohein who eats clean terumah, a non-priest who eats terumah, a non-priest, an unclean (priest), and a tvul yom (one who immersed in the daytime and did not wait until sunset) who officiates, one lacking atonement, one lacking (the full complement of priestly) garments, one who did not lave his hands and feet, one who is drunk, and one with disheveled hair. Death is explicitly mentioned in respect to some, and some are derived by our rabbis (as subject to death) through the tradition by identity (gezeirah shavah) or by comparison (hekesh)]."

            "\tA stringency of the words of the scribes over the words of the Torah: If one says that there are no tefillin, in transgression of the words of the Torah, he is not liable, [this not being \"ruling.\" For he is told (as it were): \"Go and learn!\"] (But if one says that) there are five frontlets (totafoth), adding to the words of the scribes, he is liable, [this constituting a ruling. And even though this only adds to the words of the scribes, he is liable. For in the medrash of the scribes it is written: The word \"letotafoth\" is written three times (Exodus 13:16, Deuteronomy 6:8, and Deuteronomy 11:18), twice defective and once plene, giving a total of four sections (in the head phylactery)].", 
            "\tHe (a rebellious elder) is executed neither by the beth-din of his city nor by the beth-din in Yavneh [If they inquired of the beth-din in the chamber of hewn stone, and they ruled for him, and he returned to his city and remained there many days, until the great Sanhedrin was exiled to Yavneh, and then he ruled as at first, he is not executed in Yavneh, even though the great Sanhedrin is there, and even if the Temple still stands, the great Sanhedrin not sitting in its place in the chamber of hewn stone.], but he is brought up to the great beth-din in Jerusalem and kept there until the festival, it being written (Deuteronomy 17:13): \"And all the people shall hear and fear and not presume again.\" These are the words of R. Akiva. R. Yehudah says: His judgment is not delayed, but he is executed immediately, and it is written, and messengers are sent (to proclaim) in all places: \"This man, the son of this man, was found liable to the death penalty by beth-din.\"", 
            "\tA false prophet — one who prophesies what he did not hear [i.e., what was not stated in prophecy to any prophet], and what was not said to him, [but to his colleague, from whom he heard it, and he came and said that it was said to him] — his death is at the hands of man. [Both of these are false prophets, and their death is by strangulation, it being written (Deuteronomy 18:20): \"But the prophet who shall presume to speak a thing in My name\" — this is one who prophesies what he never heard — \"which I did not command him\" — but which I commanded to his neighbor. This is one who prophesies what was not said to him but which was said to his neighbor — \"that prophet shall be put to death\"; and every death mentioned in the Torah, unqualified, is strangulation.] But if one suppresses his prophecy, or makes light of the words of a prophet, or transgresses his own prophecy, his death is at the hands of Heaven, it being written (Ibid. 19): \"I shall require it of him.\" [It is written (Ibid. 19): \"And it shall be, the man who shall not heed (lo yishma) My words.\" It can be read \"lo yishma\" (i.e., another) \"will not heed,\" and \"lo yashmia\" \"he will not make heard,\" and \"lo yishmah,\" i.e., he himself \"will not heed,\" so that all three are included, followed by \"I shall require it of him\" — at the hands of Heaven.]", 
            "\tOne who prophesies in the name of idolatry, saying: \"Thus did this idolatry say\" (is put to death by strangulation), even if he (i.e., what he said) coincided with the halachah, to declare the unclean unclean, and the clean, clean. One who lives with a married woman, once she enters the groom's domain for marriage, [as when the father hands her over to the groom's messengers and she is still on the way to him, in which instance she is no longer regarded as being in \"her father's house\"], is put to death by strangulation. And the zomemin of the daughter of a Cohein and her consort (are put to death by strangulation). For all zomemin \"come forward\" for that death [that they would make the adjudged liable to], except the zomemin of the daughter of a Cohein and her consort [i.e., All who live (illicitly) with a woman are subject to the same death as she, except for the consort of the daughter of a Cohein, she being subject to burning, and he, to strangulation.]"
