            "On the <b>three days before the festivals of gentiles</b> the following actions are prohibited, as they would bring joy to the gentile, who would subsequently give thanks to his object of idol worship on his festival: It is <b>prohibited to engage in business with them; to lend</b> items <b>to them or to borrow</b> items <b>from them; to lend</b> money <b>to them or to borrow</b> money <b>from them;</b> and <b>to repay</b> debts owed to <b>them or to collect repayment</b> of debts <b>from them. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may collect repayment</b> of debts <b>from them because this causes</b> the gentile <b>distress.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Even though he is distressed now,</b> when he repays the money, <b>he is happy afterward</b> that he is relieved of the debt, and therefore there is concern that he will give thanks to his object of idol worship on his festival.",
            "<b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> On <b>the three</b> days <b>before</b> the festivals of gentiles <b>and</b> on <b>the three</b> days <b>after them,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage in business with those gentiles. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>prohibited</b> to engage in business with them <b>before their festivals,</b> but it is <b>permitted</b> to engage in business with them <b>after their festivals.</b>",
            "<b>And these are the festivals of gentiles: Kalenda, Saturnalia, and Kratesis, and the day of the festival of their kings, and the birthday</b> of the king, <b>and</b> the anniversary of <b>the day of the death</b> of the king.

And the Rabbis say: Every death that includes</b> public <b>burning</b> is a festival that <b>includes idol worship, and</b> any death <b>that does not include</b> public <b>burning</b> is <b>not</b> a festival that <b>includes idol worship. But</b> in the case of <b>the day of shaving his,</b> i.e., a gentile’s, <b>beard and his locks, and the day of</b> his <b>ascent from the sea, and the day that he left prison, and</b> also in the case of <b>a gentile who prepared</b> a wedding <b>feast for his son</b> and celebrates on that day, engaging in business <b>is prohibited only</b> on <b>that day and</b> with <b>that man.</b>",
            "In the case of <b>a city in which there is</b> active <b>idol worship,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to engage in business transactions with gentiles who live <b>outside of</b> the city. If the <b>idol worship</b> is <b>outside</b> the city, it is <b>permitted</b> to engage in business <b>within</b> the city. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>traveling there,</b> a place where a pagan festival is being celebrated? <b>When the road is designated</b> only <b>for that place,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to use the road, as onlookers will assume that the traveler intends to join the festival. <b>But if one were able to travel on it to</b> arrive at <b>another place,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to use the road to reach the place that is observing the festival. With regard to <b>a city in which idol worship</b> is practiced <b>and in which there are stores that are adorned</b> for the sake of idol worship <b>and</b> there are others <b>that are not adorned, this was</b> in fact <b>an incident</b> that occurred <b>in Beit She’an, and the Sages said:</b> With regard to <b>the adorned</b> shops, it is <b>prohibited</b> to buy from them, <b>but</b> in the case of <b>those that are not adorned</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>",

Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>permitted to sell a white rooster to</b> a gentile provided that it is sold <b>along with</b> other types of <b>roosters. But when it is</b> sold <b>by itself, one</b> should <b>cut off its toe and sell it to</b> the gentile, <b>because</b> they <b>do not sacrifice a defective</b> animal <b>to</b> their object of <b>idol worship.

            "<b>One may not sell bears, or lions, or any item that can cause injury to the public, to</b> gentiles. <b>One may not build with them a basilica [<i>basileki</i>], a tribunal [<i>gardom</i>], a stadium [<i>itztadeyya</i>], or a platform.

            "<b>One may not keep an animal in the inns [<i>befundekaot</i>] of gentiles because they are suspected of bestiality.</b> Since even gentiles are prohibited from engaging in bestiality, a Jew who places his animal there is guilty of violating the prohibition: “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” (Leviticus 19:14). <b>And a woman may not seclude herself with</b> gentiles <b>because they are suspected of</b> engaging in <b>forbidden sexual relations.

            "This mishna discusses the halakhic status of various items that belong to gentiles. <b>These are items</b> that <b>belong to gentiles</b> and <b>are prohibited</b> to Jews, <b>and their prohibition is</b> that of <b>an item from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited: Wine, and vinegar belonging to gentiles that was originally wine, and Hadrianic earthenware, and hides</b> with a tear opposite the <b>heart.

            "<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Yishmael asked Rabbi Yehoshua</b> a series of questions <b>while they were traveling along the road.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>prohibit</b> the <b>cheeses of gentiles?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Because</b> gentiles <b>curdle</b> cheese <b>with the stomach</b> contents <b>of</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass,</b> and as the carcass of an unslaughtered animal is not kosher, cheese that is curdled with it is likewise prohibited. In response, Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: But aren’t the stomach</b> contents <b>of a burnt-offering</b> subject to a more <b>stringent</b> prohibition <b>than the stomach</b> contents <b>of</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass?</b> And yet <b>they said: A priest who is open-minded [<i>shedato yafa</i>]</b> with regard to what he eats <b>may swallow [<i>shorefah</i>]</b> the stomach contents of a burnt-offering while they are <b>raw, and</b> the other Sages <b>did not agree with him. But</b> the Sages <b>said: One may not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the stomach contents of a burnt-offering <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> if one did derive benefit from them, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. According to both opinions, deriving benefit from the stomach contents of a burnt-offering is not prohibited by Torah law. Since the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a burnt-offering is more stringent than that of an animal carcass, why would deriving benefit from the carcass be prohibited, while deriving benefit from the burnt-offering is permitted? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: The cheese of gentiles is prohibited <b>because they curdle it in the stomach</b> contents <b>of calves</b> used for <b>idol worship.</b> Since it is prohibited to derive benefit from such calves, cheese curdled in their stomach contents is also prohibited. Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: If</b> that is <b>so, why didn’t</b> the Sages <b>prohibit</b> deriving any <b>benefit</b> from the cheese, instead of merely prohibiting its consumption? Instead of answering Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>diverted his</b> attention <b>to another matter</b> and <b>said to him: Yishmael, how do you read</b> the following verse in the Song of Songs (1:2)? Do you read it as: <b>For Your love [<i>dodekha</i>] is better than wine,</b> or as: <b>For your love [<i>dodayikh</i>] is better</b> than wine? The first version, which is in the masculine form, would be a reference to God, whereas the second version, in the feminine, would be a reference to the Jewish people. Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him</b> that it should be read in the feminine: <b>For your love [<i>dodayikh</i>] is better</b> than wine. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: The matter is not so, as another</b> verse <b>teaches with regard to it: “Your ointments [<i>shemanekha</i>] have a goodly fragrance”</b> (Song of Songs 1:3). This phrase, which appears in the next verse, is written in the masculine form, and therefore it is determined that the preceding verse can also be understood in the masculine form.",
            " This mishna lists items belonging to gentiles which it is prohibited to consume, but from which it is permitted to derive benefit. <b>And these are items</b> that belong <b>to gentiles</b> and are <b>prohibited, but their prohibition is not</b> that of <b>an item from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited: Milk that was milked by a gentile and a Jew did not see him</b> performing this action, <b>and their bread and oil.</b> The mishna notes that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and his court permitted the oil</b> of gentiles entirely. The mishna resumes its list: <b>And boiled and pickled</b> vegetables, <b>whose</b> usual <b>manner</b> of preparation involves <b>adding wine and vinegar to them, and minced <i>tarit</i></b> fish, <b>and brine that does not have a <i>kilbit</i> fish floating in it, and <i>ḥilak</i>, and a sliver of <i>ḥiltit</i>, and <i>salkondit</i> salt</b> (see 39b); all <b>these are prohibited, but their prohibition is not</b> that of <b>item from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited.</b> ",

            "<b>All statues are forbidden,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to derive benefit from them, <b>because they are worshipped</b> at least <b>once a year;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.

            "A wise gentile, <b>Proclus ben Plospus,</b> once <b>asked</b> a question <b>of Rabban Gamliel in</b> the city of <b>Akko when he was bathing in the bathhouse of</b> the Greek god <b>Aphrodite.</b> Proclus <b>said to him: It is written in your Torah:</b> “And <b>nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). <b>For what reason do you bathe</b> before an idol <b>in the bathhouse of Aphrodite?</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: One may not answer</b> questions related to Torah <b>in the bathhouse. And when he left</b> the bathhouse, Rabban Gamliel gave him several answers. <b>He said to him: I did not come into its domain; it came into my domain.</b> The bathhouse existed before the statue dedicated to Aphrodite was erected. Furthermore, people <b>do not say: Let us make a bathhouse</b> as <b>an adornment for Aphrodite; rather,</b> they <b>say: Let us make</b> a statue of <b>Aphrodite</b> as <b>an adornment for the bathhouse.</b> Therefore, the main structure is not the Aphrodite statue, but the bathhouse. Rabban Gamliel continued: <b>Alternatively,</b> there is another answer: Even <b>if</b> people would <b>give you a lot of money, you would not enter</b> before <b>your</b> object of <b>idol worship naked, or</b> as <b>one who experienced a seminal emission</b> who comes to the bathhouse to purify himself, <b>nor</b> would you <b>urinate before it. This</b> statue <b>stands upon the sewage pipe and all the people urinate before it.</b> There is no prohibition in this case, as <b>it is stated</b> in the verse <b>only: “Their gods”</b> (see Deuteronomy 12:2), which indicates that a statue <b>that</b> people <b>treat as a deity</b> is <b>forbidden,</b> but one <b>that</b> people <b>do not treat</b> with the respect that is <b>due to a deity</b> is <b>permitted.</b>",
            "With regard to the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>the gentiles who worship the mountains and the hills,</b> the mountains and hills <b>are permitted, but what is upon them is forbidden.</b> It is not prohibited to derive benefit from the mountains and hills themselves, and they can be used for planting, harvesting, and the like. But if gentiles coated them with gold or silver, it is prohibited to derive benefit from the coating, <b>as it is stated:</b> “The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire; <b>you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them,</b> nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared by it; for it is an abomination to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 7:25). <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> with regard to the verse: “You shall destroy all the places where the nations that you are to dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every leafy tree” (Deuteronomy 12:2): The mitzva to destroy objects of idol worship applies to <b>“their gods, upon the</b> high <b>mountains,” but not</b> to <b>the mountains</b> themselves that are <b>their gods.</b> Similarly it applies to <b>“their gods…upon the hills,” but not</b> to <b>the hills</b> themselves that are <b>their gods.</b> The mishna asks: <b>And for what reason,</b> then, is <b>an <i>ashera</i> forbidden?</b> Doesn’t the verse also state: “And under every leafy tree,” which indicates that the mitzva to destroy objects of idol worship does not apply to the trees themselves? The mishna answers: It is <b>because it</b> is the product of <b>human involvement</b> and did not grow by itself, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>anything that</b> is the product of <b>human involvement</b> is <b>forbidden.</b> <b>Rabbi Akiva says: I will explain and decide</b> the matter <b>before you.</b> The verse does not indicate limitations to the halakhic definition of idols; rather, it is simply giving indicators of prevalent idolatrous practice: <b>Everywhere that you find a high mountain, or an elevated hill, or a leafy tree, know that there is idol worship there.</b>",

In talmudic times, external walls to homes were often built in two parts, with a functional space between them. If the space between the two parts of the wall <b>belonged to him and to</b> the house of <b>idol worship,</b> the area <b>is treated</b> as <b>half and half</b>  with regard to withdrawing into his property before rebuilding the wall; he may build the wall four cubits from the middle of that space. <b>The stones of</b> the fallen wall, <b>its wood, and its dust, transmit impurity like a creeping animal,</b> i.e., one who touches them becomes impure like one who touches a creeping animal, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and be accursed like it; <b>you shall detest it [<i>shakketz teshakketzennu</i>],</b> and you shall abhor it; for it is a proscribed item” (Deuteronomy 7:26). The term <i>shakketz</i> is used in a different form, <i>shekketz</i>, with regard to creeping animals. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Those items transmit impurity <b>like a menstruating woman, as it is stated: “You will put them far away as a menstruating woman; you shall say to it: Go away”</b> (Isaiah 30:22). <b>Just as a menstruating woman transmits impurity by carrying,</b> as one who moves a menstruating woman, even without touching her, becomes impure, <b>so too,</b> objects of <b>idol worship transmit impurity by carrying.</b>",

If one <b>brought</b> an object of <b>idol worship into</b> a house temporarily <b>and</b> then <b>removed it,</b> the house <b>is</b> then <b>permitted.</b> With regard to idol worship <b>there are three</b> types of <b>stones,</b> each with its own <i>halakhot</i>. <b>A stone that</b> one <b>initially hewed for</b> use in <b>a platform [<i>bimos</i>]</b> for an idol <b>is forbidden.</b> If one <b>plastered</b> a stone <b>or cemented it for the sake of idol worship, one removes that which he plastered or cemented and</b> the stone <b>is permitted.</b> If one <b>erected</b> an object of <b>idol worship upon</b> a stone <b>and</b> subsequently <b>removed it,</b> the stone <b>is</b> then <b>permitted.</b> <b>There are three</b> types of <b>trees</b> that were used as part of idolatrous rites <b>[<i>ashera</i>]: A tree that one initially planted for the sake of idol worship is forbidden,</b> and one may not derive benefit from any part of the tree. If one <b>lopped</b> off part of the trunk of a tree <b>or trimmed</b> its branches <b>for the sake of idol worship,</b> i.e., to worship that which would regrow there, <b>and</b> the tree’s trunk or limbs <b>regrew, one removes that which has regrown</b> and burn it. The remainder of the tree is then permitted. If one <b>erected</b> an object of <b>idol worship beneath</b> a tree <b>and</b> subsequently <b>removed it, it is permitted</b> to derive benefit from the tree. <b>Which</b> tree <b>is</b> deemed forbidden as <b>an <i>ashera</i>? Any</b> tree <b>that has</b> an object of <b>idol worship beneath it. Rabbi Shimon says: Any</b> tree <b>that</b> people <b>worship. And</b> there was <b>an incident in Tzaidan involving a tree that</b> people <b>would worship, and</b> Jews <b>found beneath it a heap</b> of stones. <b>Rabbi Shimon said to them: Examine this heap</b> of stones. <b>And they examined it and found in it</b> an idolatrous <b>image.</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: Since</b> it is <b>the image</b> that <b>they worship, we can permit</b> use of <b>the tree to</b> those who wish to derive benefit from it.",

            "If one <b>took wood from</b> an <i>ashera</i>, it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. In a case where one <b>kindled</b> a fire in <b>an oven with</b> the wood, <b>if</b> it is <b>a new</b> oven and by kindling the fire he hardened the oven and made it stronger for use in the future, then the oven <b>must be shattered.</b> Since forbidden items were used in the process of forming the oven, one may not derive benefit from the use of the forbidden items. <b>But if</b> it is <b>an old</b> oven <b>it may be cooled;</b> it is prohibited to use the oven only while it is still hot. If one <b>baked bread with</b> wood from the <i>ashera</i> as the fuel, it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the bread.
