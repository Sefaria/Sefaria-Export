            "During the three days preceding the festivals of the non-Jews, it is forbidden to do business with them, to lend them something or to borrow something from them, to lend [money] to them or to borrow [money] from them, to resolve your debt to them or to have them resolve their debt to you. Rabbi Yehuda says: One can have them resolve their debt since it causes him distress. They [the Sages] said to him: even though he might be in distress at the outset, eventually he will be joyful.", 
            "Rabbi Yishmael says: [the above] is forbidden for three days before the festivals and three days after the festivals. The Sages say: before the festivals it is forbidden, after the festivals it is permitted.", 
            "And these, according to Rabbi Meir, are the festivals of the non-Jews: Kalendae, Saturnalia, Kratesim, kings' days of accession, the day of birth, and the day of death. And the Sages say: every funeral in which a conflagration is present [thereby] involves idol worship. One that has no conflagration does not involve idol worship. [A celebration of] the day on which a [non-Jewish] man cuts his beard or his hair, the day that he came ashore from the sea, and the day he was released from prison, and a pagan who made a feast for his son, [for all these] the prohibition extends only to that day and that man alone.", 
            "It is permitted [to do business, etc.] outside of a city that has idolatry within it. If there is idolatry outside the city, it is permitted [to do business, etc.] within the city. Is one permitted to travel to such a place [on the days of their festivals]? If road leads to this place alone, it is forbidden; but if one can walk along this road to another location, it is permitted. Regarding a city which has idolatry within it, and has both ornamented and un-ornamented shop fronts, this was the case in Beit Sh'an, and [there] the Sages said: The ornamented shops are forbidden and those shops without ornamentation are permitted.", 
            "It is forbidden to sell the following items to non-Jews: pine-cones, white figs and their stalks, frankincense, and white chickens. Rabbi Yehuda says: one is permitted to sell them a white chicken amongst a group of chickens; and if it is alone he must clip its toe and sell it, since they do not sacrifice blemished animals for idolatry. As for all remaining items, if [their intention was] not specified one is permitted [to sell them], but if specified, it is forbidden. Rabbi Meir says: fine palm dates, sweet dates, and the Nikolaos dates are also forbidden to be sold to non-Jews.", 
            "In a place in which it is customary to sell small livestock to non-Jews, one may sell. In a place in which it is customary not to sell, one may not sell. And in all places it is forbidden to sell them large livestock, calves or foals, healthy or broken. Rabbi Yehuda permits in the case of a broken one. Ben Beterah permits in the case of a horse.", 
            "One may not sell to them bears, lions, or anything that may cause harm to the public. One cannot build with them a basilica, a gallows, a stadium, or a dais. But one can build with them public bathhouses, as well as [private] bathhouses. [In the building process,] when they reach the arched chamber in which they erect an object of idolatry, it is forbidden to [help] build.", 
            "One may not make jewelry for purposes of idolatry: necklaces, nose rings, or rings. Rabbi Eliezer says: It is permissible to do so for a salary. One may not sell them produce that is connected to the ground. But it may be sold once it is picked. Rabbi Yehuda says: One may sell [unpicked produce] with an agreement that it will be picked. One may not rent them houses in the Land of Israel, and we need not even mention fields [which are certainly forbidden to rent]; and in Syria [conquered land North of Israel, treated like Israel only with regard to some laws], one may rent them houses, but not fields; and outside of the Land one may sell them houses and rent them fields; these are words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: In the Land of Israel it is permitted to rent them houses but not fields; and in Syria it is permitted to sell them houses and rent them fields; and outside of the Land, one may sell them either one.", 
            "Even in the cases in which they permitted renting out [to a non-Jew], they did not say this regarding permanent residence, for he will bring an idol into it, as it is said (Devarim 7:26): You shall not bring an abomination into your house. And one is always forbidden to rent him a [private] bathhouse, because it will still be called by his [the Jew's] name."

A man should not be alone with them, for they are suspect regarding the spilling of blood. A Jewess should not be a midwife to a non-Jewish woman, for she is birthing one for [a life of] idolatry. But a non-Jewish woman may be a midwife to a Jewess. A Jewess may not suckle a child of a non-Jewish woman, but a non-Jewish woman may suckle the child of a Jewess, within her domain.", 
            "One may accept their [non-Jew's] healing for one's property, but not healing for people. And one should not have one's hair cut by them under any circumstances, according to Rabbi Meir.

Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says: If [the hole is] round then it is prohibited, but if it is stretched it is allowed. Meat that is entering [a place of] idolatry is allowed, but leaving, it is prohibited, because it is like sacrifices of the dead, according to Rabbi Akiva. Those who are going on an idolatrous pilgrimage, it is prohibited to do business with them, but with those who are coming back, it is permitted.",

The Sages say: Their prohibition is not against deriving benefit from them. The grape pits and grape skins of non-Jews are prohibited and it is prohibited to derive any benefit from them, according to Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: If they are moist, they are prohibited, if dry, they are permitted. The fish-brine and Bithynian cheese of non-Jews are prohibited and it is prohibited to derive any benefit from them, according to Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: Their prohibition is not against deriving benefit from them.", 
            "Rabbi Yehuda says: Rabbi Ishmael asked Rabbi Yehoshua [a question] as they were walking along the road. He said to him, \"What is the cause for the prohibition against the cheese of non-Jews?\" He said to him, \"Because they curdle it inside the stomach of carrion.\" He said to him, \"But is not [the law regarding] the stomach of a burnt offering more stringent than the stomach of carrion?! And they [the Sages] said: [It was proposed that] a priest with a good disposition may burn [a burnt offering after sucking out the fat from its stomach] while it it still raw [and has not yet been burnt with the offering, which would forbid one form deriving any benefit from it]. And they [the sages] did not agree with him [who proposed this opinion], but they said: One may not derive benefit [from the fats of the stomach], nor is one [who does so] liable for <i>meilah</i> [deriving prohibited benefit from from a sanctified object].\" [Implying that one should therefore not be liable for the less stringent case of a stomach of carrion.] He [Rabbi Yehoshua] retracted, and [instead] said, \"Because they curdle it in the stomachs of calves that were used for idolatry.\" And he [Rabbi Ishmael] said, \"If so, why is there no prohibition to benefit from it?\" He [Rabbi Yehoshua] redirected him to another topic. He said to him, \"Ishmael, my brother, how do you read (Shir HaShirim 1): 'For <i>dodechah</i> [Heb. masc: \"your love\"] is better than wine,' or 'For <i>dodayich</i> [Heb. fem: \"your love\") is better than wine'? He said to him:, \"'For <i>dodayich</i> is better than wine.'\" He said to him, \"The matter is not so. For its fellow [the following verse] teaches about it: 'For the fragrance of <i>shemaneikha</i> [Heb. masc: \"your oils\"] is good.'\"", 
            "These are the items of non-Jews that are prohibited, yet their prohibition is not against deriving benefit from them: milk that was milked by a non-Jew without a Jew watching, and [their] bread, and their oil [although] Rabbi and his court permitted [their] oil, and stewed vegetables, and pickled vegetables to which it is their custom to add wine and vinegar, and minced fish, and fish-brine that does not have kilbit [a kind of small fish] floating in it, and the chilaq fish, and a [cut] piece of asafoetida, and seasoned salt, all of these [items of non-Jews] are prohibited yet their prohibition is not against deriving any benefit from them.", 
            "The following are permitted to be eaten: milk that was milked by a non-Jew with a Jew watching, and honey, and bunches of grapes [alt. honeycombs], even though they drip they are not considered primed [for impurity] by a liquid, and pickled vegetables to which it is not their custom to add wine and vinegar, and fish that is not minced, and brine that has fish in it, and [whole] asafoetida leaves, and rolls of [heated] olives. Rabbi Yose says: the [olives that became] very soft are forbidden. Locusts that come from the [shopkeeper's] basket are prohibited, from but those from the stock-room are allowed, and so too regarding the priestly tithe."

            "All images are prohibited, because each one is worshiped once a year, according to Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: Only that which has in its hand  a stick, or a bird, or an orb is prohibited. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Any that has anything in its hand [is prohibited].",

            "If one finds vessels with a drawing upon it of the sun, or a drawing of the moon, or a drawing of a dragon, he should bring them to the Salt Sea [to dispose of them there]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Those upon those [vessels] which are treated with honor are forbidden; those upon those [vessels] treated disrespectfully are permitted. Rabbi Yose says: One should grind [the vessel with the drawing] and disperse it to the wind or cast it into the sea. They [the Sages] said to him: Even that might become fertilizer, as it is said (Devarim/Deuteronomy 13:18): \"And let nothing of the condemned cling to your hand.\"", 
            "Proklos son of Plosfos asked Rabban Gamliel [a question] in Akko, while he was bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite.  He said to him: \"It is written in your Torah (Deuteronomy 13:18): 'And let none of the condemned cling to your hand;' why then are you bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite?  He said to him: one does not respond [to halakhic questions] in the bathhouse. When he left, he said to him:  \"I did not come into her territory; she came into my territory.  They did not say [when they built this bathhouse]: 'Let us make a beautiful bathhouse for Aphrodite.'  Rather, they said: 'Let us make Aphrodite for the beauty of the bathhouse.' Another reason: [even] if they gave you a lot of money, you would not enter before your idolatry naked and defiled and urinating in front of it.  Yet she stands on the sewer pipe and the entire nation urinates in front of her. The verse (Deuteronomy 12:3) only applies to \"their gods;\" that which he treats like a god is prohibited, and that which he does not treat like a god is permitted.\"", 
            "Non-Jews who worship the mountains and hills, they [the mountains and hills themselves] are permitted, but that which is upon them is forbidden, as it says (Deuteronomy 7:25): You shall not covet the gold and silver that is upon them and take it. Rabbi Yose the Galilean said (Deuteronomy 12:2): \"Their gods upon the mountains,\" but the mountains are not their gods; their gods \"upon the hills,\" but the hills are not their gods. And why are Asherah trees forbidden? Because humans hands were involved in [planting] them, and any [idolatrous] thing that human hands were involved in is forbidden. Rabbi Akiva said: I will expound [the verse] and rule before you, everywhere that you find a tall mountain, a raised hill, or a verdant tree know that there is idol worship there.", 
            "One whose house abuts [a house of] idolatry, and [his own house] collapses, it is prohibited to rebuild it. How should he proceed? He should gather it four cubits into his own [space] and build. If it [the wall that collapsed] belonged both to him and to the [house of] idolatry, the [respective] law applies to each half [and only his own half may be rebuilt]. The stones, wood, and dust [of a house of idolatry] have a ritual impurity like that of vermin [i.e. through contact], as it says (Deuteronomy 7:26): You shall utterly detest it. Rabbi Akiva says: like that of a menstruating woman, as it says (Isaiah 30:22): \"You will banish them like a menstruating woman. ‘Get out!’ you will say to it.” Just as a menstruating woman renders objects impure through carrying, so too does idol worship render objects impure through carrying.", 
            "There are three [types of] houses. A house that is initially built for idolatry: this is prohibited. If it was painted and the molding was put in for idolatry, or if it was renewed [for idolatry], what is new is removed [and the rest is permitted]. If idols are brought inside and removed: this [house] is permitted. There are three [types of] stones. A stone initially hewed to be a pedestal [for an idol]: this is prohibited. If it was painted or molded for idolatry, or renewed [for idolatry], what is new is removed. If an idol was erected on top of it and removed: this [stone] is permitted. There are three [types of] <i>asherot</i>. A tree initially planted for idolatry: this is prohibited. If it was pruned and trimmed for idolatry and it sprouted, the new growth is removed. If an idol is erected under it and taken away: this [tree] is permitted. What is an <i>asherah</i>? Every [tree] that has idolatry below it. Rabbi Shimon says: Every [tree] that is worshiped. It happened in Tzidon, regarding a tree that was worshiped, that they found below it a pile of stones. Rabbi Shimon said to them: \"Examine this pile.\" They examined it and found an image. He said to them: \"Because the image is what was worshiped, we shall permit the tree for them.\"",

If it encroaches on the public [domain], one who passes beneath it is pure. Vegetables may be sown beneath it in the rainy season but not in the sunny season. Lettuces may [be sown there] neither in the sunny season nor in the rainy season.

If one baked bread in it, it is prohibited for benefit. If [the bread] became mixed up with others, they are all prohibited for benefit.  Rabbi Eliezer said: Let him cast [a sum equivalent to the worth of their] benefit into the Dead Sea!  They said to him: There is no redemption when it comes to idolatry.  If one took wood from it for a loom, it is prohibited for benefit. If he wove a garment with it, the garment is prohibited for benefit. If that garment became mixed up with others, and then those others became became mixed up with others, they are all prohibited for benefit.

The bimusioth of kings [hewn stones fixed on the road for the king as pedestals for idolatry, so that when he passes by there he may bow down to it] are permitted because they are placed there when the kings pass by. The Gemara explains: \"Because they place it down.\" That is, they are not fixed there for all times, but only when the kings pass by.

If he hired it to ride upon, even if the gentile placed his (wine) vessel upon it, his hire fee is permitted.[This Mishnah is adduced for its latter part, that if one hires an ass to ride upon, even though he apparently hired it also to place his wine vessel and food upon — so that one might think that this is to be considered as if he had hired it ab initio to transport yayin nesech and the hire fee is forbidden — we are apprised otherwise.]", 
            "\tIf yayin nesech fell on grapes, he rinses them [in cold water] and they are permitted. If they were split, they are forbidden. [(Our Mishnah is defective. It was taught (after \"they are forbidden\") thus: \"And if it imparts an unsalutary taste it is permitted.\"] And it happened [thus] with Baitus the son of Zonin that he transported dried figs in a boat, and a jug of yayin nesech broke and fell upon them, and he inquired [the halachah] of the sages and they permitted them. This is the rule: All which in its enjoyment involves the imparting of a [forbidden] flavor is forbidden. All which in its enjoyment does not involve the imparting of a forbidden flavor is permitted, as when [forbidden] vinegar falls upon permitted grits, [in which instance the flavor imparted is an unsalutary one. (And this, when the grits are boiling when the vinegar falls upon them, in which instance it spoils them from beginning to end. There are four types of imparted flavors: 1) a flavor which is salutary from beginning to end, such as that of (forbidden) wine in cooked flesh or fish. This is forbidden of a certainty. 2) a flavor which is unsalutary from beginning to end, such as that of (forbidden) fish fats or (forbidden) flesh in honey. This is permitted ab initio. 3) a flavor that is unsalutary in the beginning but salutary in the end, such as (forbidden) honey in wine, which spoils it at the outset, but which lends it aroma and flavor once the wine gains ascendancy over it. 4) a flavor that is salutary in the beginning, but unsalutary at the end, such as that of the fats of flesh with butter or that (i.e., the flavor of) a vessel, not (used) on the same day, which (flavor) when it entered was salutary, and later became unsalutary. These (last) two are forbidden out of doubt. Therefore, if these grits into which vinegar fell were not boiling, they are forbidden out of doubt. For vinegar in (unboiled) grits is (at first) unsalutary and (then) salutary. And even though, if he boils them afterwards, the flavor is spoiled, this is an instance of enhancing and then spoiling, and it is forbidden (out of doubt).]", 
            "\tIf a gentile, together with a Jew, were taking jugs of wine from place to place — if he (the gentile) were in the status of being watched, it (the wine) is permitted. [So long as he (the Jew) did not inform him that he is leaving, he (the gentile) is in the status of being watched, even if he went a mile away; for the gentile is always afraid that the Jew will return and see him.] If he informs him that he is going far off [and he walks away from him (the jugs being closed) — if he stays away] long enough [for him] to open [\"yistom\" (as in [Numbers 24:3] \"shethum ha'ayin\" — \"the open of eye.\") i.e., to bore a hole in the stopper of the jug], and to re-close it and [for the closing] to dry, [it is forbidden]. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: [It is not forbidden until he stays away long enough] for him to open it and make another stopper and [for the closing] to dry. [But they were not concerned about his boring a hole in the stopper of the jug, for this is recognizable. And it is only in relation to a lime stopper that the Rabbis differ with R. Shimon b. Gamliel, fearing that he might bore a hole in it, this not being recognizable, the lime being white, and the difference between the old and the new lime not being discernible. But with a clay stopper, the Rabbis concede to R. Shimon b. Gamliel that the wine is not forbidden until he stays away long enough for him to open the entire stopper and replace it and have it dry. The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel.]", 
            "\tIf one left his wine on a wagon or on a boat [with a gentile], and he took a short-cut, [leaving by one gate and returning by the opposite gate] — if he entered the city and bathed [in the bath-house], it (the wine) is permitted. [For since the gentile did not know that he would stay away, he would fear (his early return) and not touch the wine.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: [It is not forbidden until he stays away] long enough for him to open it and make another stopper and [for the closing] to dry. If one leaves a gentile in the shop, even if he (the Jew) goes in and out, it is permitted. And if he informs him that he is going far off [and he walks away from him, and stays away long enough [for him] to open and to reclose it and [for the closing] to dry, [it is forbidden]. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: [It is not forbidden until he stays away] long enough for him to open it and make another stopper and [for the closing] to dry. [The Mishnah apprises us of the dispute between R. Shimon b. Gamliel and the Rabbis in these three instances. For if it taught [only] the instance of a gentile transporting jugs of wine, I might think it is [only] then that we assume that the gentile will fear his imminent return, but in the instance of a boat or a wagon, he can sail away and do what he wishes without fear. And if it taught [only] the instance of a boat or a wagon and not that of leaving a gentile in his shop, I might think that the gentile would fear to do so only in the first instance, lest the Jew leave by one path and return by another and see him, whereas in the second instance, he might say I will close the shutter and do as I like. Therefore, all three instances must be stated, and in all, the halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel.]",

And if he said to him: \"Pour and drink,\" even that on the side table is forbidden. [Since he gave him \"carte blanche,\" even what is on the side table is forbidden, for he takes this as license to touch everything.] Open jugs [found in the house where he left him] are forbidden; closed ones [are forbidden if he stays away long enough] for him to open them and make another stopper and [for the closing] to dry.

If one sells his wine to a gentile — If he stipulates the price [so much wine for so much money] before he measures it out (into his vessels), its monies (received in exchange) are permitted. [For meshichah (drawing to oneself the object to be acquired) effects acquisition for a gentile as it does for a Jew. So that when the Jew measures it out into his vessels and the vessel enters the domain of the gentile, he acquires it with meshichah, so that the Jew is (already) owed money by the gentile as a loan; and it does not become yayin nesech until the gentile touches (the wine itself).] But if he measures it out (into his vessels) before he stipulates the price, its monies are forbidden. [For the gentile does not acquire it now with meshichah. For since he has not yet stipulated the price, he has not committed himself to acquire it with meshichah, lest the Jew overcharge him. Therefore, when he touches it, it is yayin nesech in the domain of the Jew, the gentile not acquiring it until the price is stipulated.] If he (the Jew) took his funnel and measured out (his wine) into the vessels of the gentile, if it (the funnel) [in which he first measured out the wine for the gentile has a rim of wine, [which prevents one or two drops from leaving its mouth], it is forbidden. [The wine of the Jew is forbidden because of that drop of yayin nesech in the funnel.] If he [a Jew] pours [wine] from his vessel into a vessel [in the hand of a gentile or into a vessel containing yayin nesech], what he poured from is permitted [i.e., the wine remaining in the upper vessel in the hand of the Jew is permitted,] and what he poured into it is forbidden [i.e., the flow that left the Jew's vessel, even though it did not reach the vessel in the hand of the gentile (and, it goes without saying, what did reach the vessel of the gentile), is forbidden. [For \"the flow is regarded as connected\" (to the vessel beneath it.) and our Mishnah, which permits the wine left in the vessel in the hand of the Jew, speaks of an instance where the flow from the upper vessel was cut off before it reached the lower vessel in the hand of the gentile, so that there was no flow here which would connect what was in the upper vessel to what was in the lower vessel. Or, (our Mishnah speaks of an instance) where he shakes out wine from the upper vessel, as from a sprinkling bowl, so that there was no flow which would connect the wine in the vessel in the hand of the Jew to the vessel in the hand of the gentile. But if there were such a connection, then everything remaining in the upper vessel in the hand of the Jew is forbidden as yayin nesech by the principle of the flow being regarded as a connection. This is the halachah.]",

Wine [yayin nesech, which became intermixed] with [permitted] wine, and water [used for idolatrous libations or which was itself worshipped, which became intermixed] with [permitted] water [forbids] by any amount. [There is no difference whether the permitted fall into the forbidden or the forbidden into the permitted — it forbids its own kind by any amount, so long as the forbidden that falls into the permitted falls from a wide-mouthed vessel, so that a large amount of wine leaves the vessel at one time. But if one pours yayin nesech from a small vessel, which emerges only drop by drop, and it falls into permitted wine even the whole day, we say of it \"the first drop that falls is cancelled\" (by what it falls into, etc.) And if he pours permitted into forbidden, everything that he pours into the forbidden is forbidden, even a full jug onto one drop.] Wine [which became intermixed] with water, and water [which became intermixed with wine — the criterion is] the producing of a flavor. This is the rule: kind into kind (forbids) by any amount; and kind into what is not its kind, by the producing of a flavor. The conclusion, according to the halachah: All that is forbidden by the Torah, whether (it became intermixed) with its kind or not with its kind (forbids) by producing its flavor — except for tevel (untithed produce) and yayin nesech, which (if intermixed) with its kind (forbids) by any amount; and, if not with its kind, by (producing) its flavor — yayin nesech, because of the stringency of idolatry, and tevel, \"As its permitting, so is its forbidding,\" i.e., Just as one grain (of tithe) permits the entire pile, so one (untithed) grain renders the entire pile tevel. And if an issur (something forbidden) of other types of issurin becomes intermixed with heter (something permitted) — if kind became intermixed with not its kind, so that it can be determined by taste whether it is terumah (tithe) which has become intermixed with chullin (untithed produce), let a Cohein taste it, and if it is a (generic) issur, let a gentile baker taste it. If he says that there is not in the intermixture, the flavor of terumah or the flavor of issur (respectively), all is permitted. And if kind became intermixed with kind, so that it is not possible to rule by flavor, or a kind (which became intermixed) with not its kind and no Cohein or reliable gentile (respectively) is available — then, if the issur is forbidden fats or blood, carrion or treifah, unclean animals or creeping things, and the like — the criterion for the mixture is sixty, i.e., If there are sixty parts of heter to one part of issur, all is permitted, and if not, all is forbidden. And if the issur is terumah, or challah, or bikkurim, the criterion (for permitting the mixture) is one hundred parts of heter; and if arlah and klai hakerem, the criterion is two hundred parts.]",

Kiddushin 2:8] and the hair of a Nazirite, [from which it is forbidden to derive benefit, viz.
