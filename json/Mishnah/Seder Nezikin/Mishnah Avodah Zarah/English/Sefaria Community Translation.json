            "All images are prohibited, because each one is worshiped once a year, according to Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: Only that which has in its hand  a stick, or a bird, or an orb is prohibited. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Any that has anything in its hand [is prohibited].",
            "If one finds shards of an image, these are permitted. If one finds the form of a hand or the form of a foot, these are prohibited, because equivalent ones are worshiped.",
            "If one finds vessels with a drawing upon it of the sun, or a drawing of the moon, or a drawing of a dragon, he should bring them to the Salt Sea [to dispose of them there]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Those upon those [vessels] which are treated with honor are forbidden; those upon those [vessels] treated disrespectfully are permitted. Rabbi Yose says: One should grind [the vessel with the drawing] and disperse it to the wind or cast it into the sea. They [the Sages] said to him: Even that might become fertilizer, as it is said (Devarim/Deuteronomy 13:18): \"And let nothing of the condemned cling to your hand.\"",
            "Proklos son of Plosfos asked Rabban Gamliel [a question] in Akko, while he was bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite.  He said to him: \"It is written in your Torah (Deuteronomy 13:18): 'And let none of the condemned cling to your hand;' why then are you bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite?  He said to him: one does not respond [to halakhic questions] in the bathhouse. When he left, he said to him:  \"I did not come into her territory; she came into my territory.  They did not say [when they built this bathhouse]: 'Let us make a beautiful bathhouse for Aphrodite.'  Rather, they said: 'Let us make Aphrodite for the beauty of the bathhouse.' Another reason: [even] if they gave you a lot of money, you would not enter before your idolatry naked and defiled and urinating in front of it.  Yet she stands on the sewer pipe and the entire nation urinates in front of her. The verse (Deuteronomy 12:3) only applies to \"their gods;\" that which he treats like a god is prohibited, and that which he does not treat like a god is permitted.\"",
            "Non-Jews who worship the mountains and hills, they [the mountains and hills themselves] are permitted, but that which is upon them is forbidden, as it says (Deuteronomy 7:25): You shall not covet the gold and silver that is upon them and take it. Rabbi Yose the Galilean said (Deuteronomy 12:2): \"Their gods upon the mountains,\" but the mountains are not their gods; their gods \"upon the hills,\" but the hills are not their gods. And why are Asherah trees forbidden? Because humans hands were involved in [planting] them, and any [idolatrous] thing that human hands were involved in is forbidden. Rabbi Akiva said: I will expound [the verse] and rule before you, everywhere that you find a tall mountain, a raised hill, or a verdant tree know that there is idol worship there.",
            "One whose house abuts [a house of] idolatry, and [his own house] collapses, it is prohibited to rebuild it. How should he proceed? He should gather it four cubits into his own [space] and build. If it [the wall that collapsed] belonged both to him and to the [house of] idolatry, the [respective] law applies to each half [and only his own half may be rebuilt]. The stones, wood, and dust [of a house of idolatry] have a ritual impurity like that of vermin [i.e. through contact], as it says (Deuteronomy 7:26): You shall utterly detest it. Rabbi Akiva says: like that of a menstruating woman, as it says (Isaiah 30:22): \"You will banish them like a menstruating woman. ‘Get out!’ you will say to it.” Just as a menstruating woman renders objects impure through carrying, so too does idol worship render objects impure through carrying.",
            "There are three [types of] houses. A house that is initially built for idolatry: this is prohibited. If it was painted and the molding was put in for idolatry, or if it was renewed [for idolatry], what is new is removed [and the rest is permitted]. If idols are brought inside and removed: this [house] is permitted. There are three [types of] stones. A stone initially hewed to be a pedestal [for an idol]: this is prohibited. If it was painted or molded for idolatry, or renewed [for idolatry], what is new is removed. If an idol was erected on top of it and removed: this [stone] is permitted. There are three [types of] <i>asheras</i>. A tree initially planted for idolatry: this is prohibited. If it was pruned and trimmed for idolatry and it sprouted, the new growth is removed. If an idol is erected under it and taken away: this [tree] is permitted. What is an <i>asherah</i>? Every [tree] that has idolatry below it. Rabbi Shimon says: Every [tree] that is worshiped. It happened in Tzidon, regarding a tree that was worshiped, that they found below it a pile of stones. Rabbi Shimon said to them: \"Examine this pile.\" They examined it and found an image. He said to them: \"Because the image is what was worshiped, we shall permit the tree for them.\"",
            "One should not sit in its shade, but if one did sit he is pure. One should not pass beneath it, and if one did pass he is impure. If it encroaches on the public [domain], one who passes beneath it is pure. Vegetables may be sown beneath it in the rainy season but not in the sunny season. Lettuces may [be sown there] neither in the sunny season nor in the rainy season. Rabbi Yose says: Not even vegetables in the rainy season, because the leaves [of the <i>ashera</i>] fall on them and become fertilizer.",
            "If one took some wood from it, it is prohibited for benefit.  If one stoked the oven with it: if [the oven] is new, it must be shattered; if old, it must be cooled.  If one baked bread in it, it is prohibited for benefit. If [the bread] became mixed up with others, they are all prohibited for benefit.  Rabbi Eliezer said: Let him cast [a sum equivalent to the worth of their] benefit into the Dead Sea!  They said to him: There is no redemption when it comes to idolatry.  If one took wood from it for a loom, it is prohibited for benefit. If he wove a garment with it, the garment is prohibited for benefit. If that garment became mixed up with others, and then those others became became mixed up with others, they are all prohibited for benefit. Rabbi Eliezer said: Let him cast [a sum equivalent to the worth of their] benefit into the Dead Sea!  They said to him: There is no redemption when it comes to idolatry.",
            "How does one annul [the idolatrous status of an <i>ashera</i>]? If one trims or prunes, removes a branch or a stick, or even a leaf, it is annulled.  If [after picking from it] one smooths it over for its tree's [aesthetic] sake, it is prohibited, but if not for its sake, then it is permitted."

            "Rabbi Yishmael says: Three stones side by side beside a Markulis [an idol worshiped by placing stones beside it] are prohibited; two [stones] are permitted. And the Sages say: Those that appear to be with it [and which may have fallen from idol] are prohibited, but those that do not appear to be with it are permitted.",
            "If one found on its [the idol's] head money, clothing, or vessels, these are permitted. [If one found there] grape vines, crowns of wheat stalks, wines and oil, or flours, or any type of thing which is brought on the alter, they are prohibited.",
            "An idol that had a garden or a bath house, one can benefit from it without giving payment in return, but one cannot benefit from it if one gives payment in return. If it belonged to an idol and to others, one can benefit from them regardless of whether or not one gives payment in return.",
            "The idol of a non-Jew is automatically prohibited [for benefit]. One belonging to a Jew, is not prohibited until it is worshiped. A non-Jew can nullify his idol and his friend's, but a Jew cannot nullify the idol of a non-Jew. One who nullifies an idol also nullifies its accouterments. If he nullified its accouterments, the accouterments are permitted, but it [the idol] is prohibited.",
            "How does one nullify [an idol]? If he cut off the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, the tip of a finger, or if he dented it even though he did not diminish it, he has nullified it. If he spat before it, urinated before it, dragged it, or threw excrement at it, it is not nullified. If he sold it or used it as collateral, Rebbi says: He has nullified it. But the sages say: He has not nullified it.  ",
            "An idol whose worshipers abandoned it during peaceful becomes permitted [for benefit]; if during war times, it is prohibited. Royal pillars [upon which idols would be placed] are permitted, because they are erected [only for] when the king is passing by.",
            "They asked the elders of Rome: If [Hashem] does not desire idolatry, why does He not destroy it[s objects]. They said to them: If only they were worshiping things which the world does not need, He would destroy them; but they worship the sun and the moon and the stars and the constellations--should the whole world be destroyed on account of the fools? They said to them: If so, let Him destroy those [idols] that the world does not need, and leave the ones that the world does need? They said to them: Then we would even be strengthening the faith of their worshipers, for they would say, \"This is the proof they are gods for they were not destroyed.\" ",
            "One may buy a stepped on wine press from a non-Jew even though he takes [the crushed grapes from there] with his hand and places them in the pile. It does not become libation wine until it drains to the pit. Once it has drained to the pit, [if the non-Jew touched it,] what is in the pit is prohibited and the rest is permitted. ",
            "One can press grapes with a non-Jew in the wine press, but he cannot harvest with him. A Jew who makes [his wine] while impure, one may not press or harvest with him, but one may send barrels with him to the wine press and bring them from the wine press with him. A baker who makes [his bread] while impure, one may not knead or shape the dough with him, but one can bring bread with him to the seller. ",
            "A non-Jew who was found next to a pit of wine, if he has a lien, it is prohibited; if he does not have a lien, it is permitted. If he fell into the pit and climbed out, or he measured it with a reed, or he flicked out a bug with a reed, or if he was tapping [the foam] on a barrel that was boiling over, each of these cases happened, and they said the wine should be sold. But Rabbi Shimon permits [the wine in such cases]. If he took the barrel and threw it into the pit in his anger--this case happened and they allowed it. ",
            "One who prepares wine in purity for a non-Jew and places it in his domain in a house that is open to the public domain, in a city that had both Jews and non-Jews, it is permitted; in a city that is entirely non-Jews, it is prohibited, unless he places a guard. But the guard does not have to be sitting and guarding [constantly]; even if he is leaving and entering, it is permitted. Rabbi Shimon son of Elazar said: all domains of non-Jews are like one [another].",
            "One who prepares wine in purity for a non-Jew and places it in his domain, and the latter writes for him a receipt that he received the money, it is permitted. But if the Jew wanted to remove the wine [from his property] and the non-Jew will not allow him until he receives his payment--this case happened in Beit She'an and the sages prohibited it.  "

            "One who hires a worker to work with him with <i>yayin nesech</i> [Wine used for idolatrous libations – prohibited for consumption and benefit], his salary is prohibited.  If one hired him to perform a different task, even if he said to him move that barrel of <i>yayin nesech</i> from one place to another, his salary is permitted.  One who rents a donkey in order to transport <i>yayin nesech</i> , its rental fee is prohibited.  If it was rented to ride on, even though the non-Jew placed his flask [of <i>yayin nesech</i> ] upon it, its rental fee is permitted.",

(If they fell on figs or dates, if there is enough wine to impart its flavor [into the fruit] it is prohibited.) It once happened that Baytus Son of Zonin brought dried figs on a boat and a barrel of <i>yayin nesech</i> burst and fell on them and he asked the sages and they permitted [the figs]. This is the rule: if there is increased benefit due to the imparted flavor it is prohibited, but if there is no increased benefit due to the imparted flavor it is permitted, like in the case of vinegar that fell on grits.",
            "A non-Jew who was transporting jugs of wine with a Jew from one place to another, if it could be assumed [by the non-Jew] that  they were being guarded, then they are permitted. If he let him know that he was going away, [they are prohibited] if there elapsed enough time [for the non-Jew] to puncture [the seal], patch it, and dry it.  Rabbi Shimon son of Gamliel says: Enough time for him to open it, put in a new seal, and allow it to dry.",

If he said to him \"please pour and drink,\" even what is on the side table is prohibited.  Open barrels are prohibited, and also closed ones if there elapsed enough time for him to open it, put in a new seal, and allow it to dry. ",
            "A troop of non-Jewish investigating soldiers that enter a city at a time of peace, all open barrels are prohibited but sealed barrels are permitted.  In a time of war, both are permitted, since there is no time to pour libations.  ",
            "Jewish craftsmen whom a non-Jew paid in <i>yayin nesech</i>, they are permitted to say to him, give us its value; but once it enters their domain, it is prohibited. One who sells his wine to a non-Jew, if he set the price before measuring out [the wine], the money is permitted; but if he measured it out before setting the price, the money is prohibited. If one took a funnel and measured [wine] into a non-Jew's container, and then [using the same funnel] measured into a Jew's container, if the funnel has wine residue in it it is prohibited. One pouring from one vessel into another [when the latter has <i>yayin nesech</i> in it], the one he poured from is permitted, but the one he poured into is prohibited.  ",
            "<i>Yayin nesech</i> is prohibited, and even a minute amount makes other things prohibited. Wine in wine or water in water, even a minute amount [of the prohibited substance renders it all prohibited]. Wine in water or water in wine, an amount [of the prohibited substance] sufficient to impart flavor [renders it prohibited].
