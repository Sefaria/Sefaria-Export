            "<b>Partners who wished to make a partition [<i>meḥitza</i>] in</b> a jointly owned <b>courtyard build the wall</b> for the partition <b>in the middle</b> of the courtyard. What is this wall fashioned from? In <b>a place where it is customary to build</b> such a wall with <b>non-chiseled stone [<i>gevil</i>],</b> or <b>chiseled stone [<i>gazit</i>],</b> or <b>small bricks [<i>kefisin</i>],</b> or <b>large bricks [<i>leveinim</i>], they must build</b> the wall with that material. <b>Everything is in accordance with the regional custom.</b> If they build the wall with <b>non-chiseled stone, this</b> partner <b>provides three handbreadths</b> of his portion of the courtyard <b>and that</b> partner <b>provides three handbreadths,</b> since the thickness of such a wall is six handbreadths. If they build the wall with <b>chiseled stone, this</b> partner <b>provides two and a half handbreadths and that</b> partner <b>provides two and a half handbreadths,</b> since such a wall is five handbreadths thick. If they build the wall <b>with small bricks, this</b> one <b>provides two handbreadths and that</b> one <b>provides two handbreadths,</b> since the thickness of such a wall is four handbreadths. If they build <b>with large bricks, this</b> one <b>provides one and a half handbreadths and that</b> one <b>provides one and a half handbreadths,</b> since the thickness of such a wall is three handbreadths. <b>Therefore, if the wall</b> later <b>falls,</b> the assumption is that <b>the space</b> where the wall stood <b>and the stones belong to both of them,</b> to be divided equally.",
            "<b>And similarly with regard to a garden,</b> in <b>a place where it is customary to build a partition</b> in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court <b>obligates</b> his neighbor to join in building the partition. <b>But with regard to</b> an expanse of <b>fields [<i>babbika</i>],</b> in <b>a place where it is customary not to build a partition</b> between two people’s fields, and one person wishes to build a partition between his field and that of his neighbor, the court <b>does not obligate</b> his neighbor to build such a partition. <b>Rather, if</b> one person <b>wishes</b> to erect a partition, <b>he must withdraw into his own</b> field <b>and build</b> the partition there. <b>And he makes</b> a border <b>mark on the outer side</b> of the barrier facing his neighbor’s property, indicating that he built the entire structure of his own materials and on his own land. <b>Therefore, if the wall</b> later <b>falls,</b> the assumption is that <b>the space</b> where the wall stood <b>and the stones</b> belong only <b>to him,</b> as is indicated by the mark on the wall. Nevertheless, in a place where it is not customary to build a partition between two people’s fields, <b>if they made</b> such a partition <b>with the agreement of the two of them, they build it in the middle,</b> i.e., on the property line, <b>and make</b> a border <b>mark on the one</b> side <b>and on the other</b> side. <b>Therefore, if the wall</b> later <b>falls,</b> the assumption is that <b>the space</b> where the wall stood <b>and the stones</b> belong <b>to both of them,</b> to be divided equally.",
            "With regard to <b>one who surrounds another on three sides,</b> that is, he owns parcels of land on three sides of the other person’s field, <b>and he built a partition</b> on <b>the first, the second, and the third</b> sides, the court <b>does not obligate</b> the neighbor who owns the inner field to contribute to the construction of the partition if he does not wish to do so. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If he arose and built a partition</b> on <b>the fourth</b> side of the field, the court <b>imposes upon</b> the owner of the inner field the responsibility to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions.",
            "In the case of a dividing <b>wall</b> in a jointly owned <b>courtyard that fell,</b> if one of the owners wishes to rebuild the wall, the court <b>obligates</b> the other owner <b>to build</b> the wall with him <b>up to</b> a height of <b>four cubits.</b> If after the wall was built one of the neighbors claims he alone constructed it and the other did not participate in its building, the latter is nevertheless <b>presumed to have given</b> his share of the money, <b>unless</b> the claimant <b>brings proof that</b> the other <b>did not give</b> his part. The court <b>does not obligate</b> the reluctant neighbor to contribute to the building of the wall <b>higher than four cubits.</b> But if the reluctant neighbor <b>built another wall close</b> to the wall that had been built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court <b>imposes upon him</b> the responsibility to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the rebuilt wall, <b>even though he has not</b> yet <b>set a roof over it.</b> Since he has demonstrated his desire to make use of what his neighbor built, he must participate in the cost of its construction. If the builder of the first wall later claims that he did not receive payment from his neighbor, the neighbor <b>is presumed not to have given</b> his share of the money, <b>unless he brings proof that he did</b> in fact <b>give</b> money for the building of the wall.",
            "The residents of a courtyard <b>can compel</b> each inhabitant of that courtyard <b>to</b> financially participate in the <b>building of a gatehouse and a door to the</b> jointly owned <b>courtyard. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says: Not all courtyards require a gatehouse,</b> and each courtyard must be considered on its own in accordance with its specific needs. Similarly, the residents of a city <b>can compel</b> each inhabitant of that city <b>to</b> contribute to the <b>building of a wall, double doors, and a crossbar for the city. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says: Not all towns require a wall.</b> With regard to this latter obligation, the mishna asks: <b>How long</b> must one live <b>in the city to be</b> considered <b>like</b> one of <b>the people of the city</b> and therefore obligated to contribute to these expenses? <b>Twelve months.</b> But if he <b>bought</b> himself <b>a residence in</b> the city, <b>he is immediately</b> considered <b>like</b> one of <b>the people of the city.</b>",
            "The court <b>does not divide a courtyard</b> at the request of one of the joint owners <b>unless there will be</b> in it four by <b>four cubits for this one and</b> four by <b>four cubits for that one,</b> i.e., this minimum area for each of the joint owners. <b>And</b> the court does <b>not</b> divide <b>a</b> jointly owned <b>field unless there is</b> space <b>in it</b> to plant <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for this one and nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for that one. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The court does not divide a field <b>unless there is</b> space <b>in it</b> to plant <b>nine half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for this one and nine half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for that one. And</b> the court does <b>not</b> divide a jointly owned <b>garden unless there is</b> space <b>in it</b> to plant <b>a half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for this one and a half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for that one. Rabbi Akiva says</b> that half that amount is sufficient, i.e., the <b>area required for sowing a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed [<i>beit rova</i>].</b> Similarly, the court does <b>not</b> divide <b>a hall [<i>hateraklin</i>], a drawing room, a dovecote, a cloak, a bathhouse, an olive press, and an irrigated field unless there is enough for this one</b> to use the property in the usual manner <b>and enough for that one</b> to use the property in the usual manner. <b>This is the principle: Anything</b> for <b>which</b> when it <b>is divided,</b> each of the parts is large enough to <b>retain the name</b> of the original item, the court <b>divides</b> it. <b>But if</b> the parts will <b>not</b> retain the original name, the court <b>does not divide</b> it. <b>When</b> does this rule apply? It applies <b>when</b> the joint owners <b>do not both wish</b> to divide the item; when only one of the owners wishes to divide the property, he cannot force the other to do so. <b>But when both of them wish</b> to divide the item, <b>they may divide</b> it, <b>even</b> if each of the owners will receive <b>less than</b> the amounts specified above. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>sacred writings,</b> i.e., a scroll of any of the twenty-four books of the Bible, that were inherited by two people, <b>they may not divide</b> them, <b>even if both of them wish</b> to do so, because it would be a show of disrespect to cut the scroll in half."

            "With regard to the <b>presumptive ownership of houses; and</b> of <b>pits; and</b> of <b>ditches; and</b> of <b>caves,</b> which are used to collect water; <b>and</b> of <b>dovecotes; and</b> of <b>bathhouses; and</b> of <b>olive presses; and</b> of <b>irrigated fields,</b> which must be watered by people; <b>and</b> of <b>slaves; and all</b> similar property <b>that constantly,</b> i.e., throughout the year, <b>generates profits, their presumptive ownership</b> is established by working and profiting from them for a duration of <b>three years from day to day.</b> If the one in possession of the property can prove that he worked and profited from it for the previous three full years, there is a presumption that it belongs to him, and would remain in his possession if another were to claim that the property belonged to him or to his ancestors. With regard to <b>a non-irrigated field,</b> i.e., one that is watered by rain, in which produce grows during certain seasons during the year, <b>its presumption</b> of ownership is established in <b>three years, but they are not from day to day,</b> since the fields are not worked and harvested continually throughout the three-year period. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Three months</b> of possession <b>in the first</b> year, <b>three</b> months of possession <b>in the last</b> year, <b>and twelve months</b> of possession <b>in the middle, which are eighteen months,</b> suffice to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to a non-irrigated field. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: A month</b> of possession <b>in the first</b> year, <b>and a month</b> of possession <b>in the last year, and twelve months</b> of possession <b>in the middle, which are fourteen months,</b> suffice to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to a non-irrigated field. <b>Rabbi Yishmael said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that eighteen months are required for a non-irrigated field, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a white field [<i>bisdeh lavan</i>],</b> i.e., a grain field. <b>But with regard to a field of trees,</b> once <b>he gathered his produce, and</b> then <b>harvested his olives,</b> and then <b>gathered his figs, these</b> three harvests <b>are</b> the equivalent of <b>three years.</b> Since he harvested three types of produce, this is equivalent to having possessed the field for three years.",
            "There are <b>three</b> independent <b>lands</b> in Eretz Yisrael <b>with regard to</b> establishing <b>presumptive ownership: Judea, and Transjordan, and the Galilee.</b> If the prior owner of the field <b>was in Judea and</b> another <b>took possession</b> of his field <b>in the Galilee,</b> or if he was <b>in the Galilee and</b> another <b>took possession</b> of his field <b>in Judea,</b> the possessor does <b>not</b> establish <b>presumptive ownership until</b> the one possessing the field <b>will be with</b> the prior owner <b>in one province. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that establishing presumptive ownership requires <b>three years only in order that</b> if the owner <b>will be in Spain [<i>Aspamya</i>], and</b> another <b>possesses</b> his field for <b>a year,</b> people <b>will go and inform</b> the owner by the end of the next <b>year, and</b> the owner will <b>come</b> back <b>in</b> the <b>following year</b> and take the possessor to court.",
            "<b>Any possession that is not accompanied by a claim</b> explaining how the possessor became the owner <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>How so?</b> If the prior owner <b>said to</b> the possessor: <b>What are you doing in my</b> land? <b>And</b> the possessor <b>said to him</b> in response: I am in possession of the land <b>because no person ever said anything to me</b> about my being here, i.e., he states no valid claim as to why he would be the owner of the land, his mere use <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. But if the possessor claimed: I am in possession of the land <b>because you sold</b> it <b>to me,</b> or: <b>Because you gave</b> it <b>to me as a gift,</b> or: Because <b>your father sold it to me,</b> or: Because <b>your father gave it to me as a gift,</b> these are valid claims to ownership. In these cases, his possession <b>is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>And one who comes</b> to claim the land <b>based on inheritance does not need a claim</b> explaining why his ancestors had a right to the land. <b>Craftsmen</b> who are in possession of items that they are repairing, <b>and partners, and sharecroppers, and stewards [<i>veha’apotropin</i>] do not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership with regard to property in their possession, as their possession is not indicative of ownership. Similarly, <b>a man does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to his wife’s property, and a wife does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to her husband’s property.

Possession is therefore not indicative of ownership. The mishna continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one establishes the presumption of ownership after profiting from the property for a certain duration, with the exception of the above people, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> a case of one who <b>has</b> mere <b>possession</b> of the property, which does, in some cases, serve as proof of ownership. <b>But in</b> a case where another person <b>gives</b> one <b>a gift, or</b> there are <b>brothers who divided</b> their inheritance, <b>or</b> there is one who <b>takes possession of</b> the <b>property of a convert</b> who died without heirs and his property is now ownerless, as soon as one <b>locked</b> the door of the property, <b>or fenced</b> it <b>or breached</b> its fence even <b>a bit, this is</b> considered <b>taking possession</b> of the property, and it effects acquisition.",

The mishna delineates the standard dimensions for various other structures. <b>A small house</b> is <b>six by eight</b> cubits. <b>A large</b> house is <b>eight by ten</b> cubits. <b>A banquet hall [<i>teraklin</i>]</b> is <b>ten by ten</b> cubits. The standard <b>height</b> for each of these structures is <b>equal to</b> the sum of <b>half its length and half its width.</b> There is <b>a proof of the matter; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The proportions are <b>like the building of the Sanctuary;</b> it was forty cubits wide and twenty cubits long and its height was thirty cubits, which is the sum of half the width and half the length.",

Consequently, when ruling in this matter the Sages did not act in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, but allowed the mother of the sons of Rokhel to give this valuable piece of jewelry to their sister without an act of acquisition having been performed. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: On Shabbat, the</b> verbal <b>statement</b> of a person on his deathbed <b>stands, as</b> he <b>cannot write,</b> and the Sages instituted that he can effect the transaction verbally lest the inability to do so exacerbate his condition. <b>But</b> a verbal instruction does <b>not</b> stand if stated <b>on a weekday. Rabbi Yehoshua says: With regard to Shabbat,</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that his verbal instruction is sufficient, even though writing is prohibited. One can infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that the same applies <b>with regard to a weekday,</b> when writing is permitted. <b>Similarly, one can acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of a minor, but one cannot acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of an adult,</b> since he can perform the act of acquisition himself; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The Sages <b>stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a minor,</b> and one may infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that this also applies <b>with regard to an adult,</b> who is able to perform the act of acquisition himself.",
            "<b>A house collapsed on</b> a son <b>and upon his father, or upon</b> a certain person <b>and upon those</b> from <b>whom he stands to inherit,</b> and it is unknown who died first.

Since it cannot be determined who died first, <b>Beit Shammai say: They divide</b> the property between them so that the father’s heirs receive half of his property and the son’s creditors receive the other half. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The <b>property</b> retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status.</b> Since the last known owner of the property was the father, the property is given to the father’s heirs.",
            "If <b>the house collapsed upon</b> a husband <b>and upon his wife,</b> and it is unknown who died first, if the wife did not have any children from her husband, then the following claims arise: <b>The husband’s heirs say:</b> The <b>wife died first</b> and was inherited by her husband, <b>and afterward the husband died,</b> and therefore the husband’s heirs inherit both his and her property. The <b>wife’s heirs say:</b> The <b>husband died first and afterward</b> the <b>wife died,</b> and her heirs inherit the property that she brought with her to the marriage and the payment of her marriage contract. <b>Beit Shammai say: They divide</b> the property under dispute between them. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The guaranteed <b>property</b> that the wife brought with her to the marriage retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status.</b> The sum of the <b>marriage contract</b> remains <b>in the possession of the husband’s heirs,</b> since the marriage contract is collected from the husband’s property. <b>Property that is brought into and taken out</b> of the marriage <b>with her,</b> i.e., usufruct property that remains in the wife’s possession during her marriage, remains <b>in the possession of the heirs of the</b> woman’s <b>father.</b>",
            "If <b>the house collapsed on</b> a son <b>and upon his mother,</b> and it is unknown who died first, the following claims arise: The mother’s paternal family claims that the son died first, and therefore they inherit from the mother, and the son’s heirs claim that the mother died first and her son inherited from her, and therefore they inherit from the son. In this case, both <b>these</b> Sages <b>and those</b> Sages, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>concede that they divide</b> the property between them. <b>Rabbi Akiva said: In this</b> case <b>I concede that the property</b> retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status.

One who tells the creditor before the loan takes place: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him, and I will give you</b> the repayment, <b>as</b> in that case the creditor <b>did loan</b> the money <b>based on his trust</b> of the guarantor. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael</b> thereupon <b>said: One who wants to become wise should engage in</b> the study of <b>monetary law, as there is no greater discipline in the Torah, and it is like a flowing spring.
