            "\tIf partners wished to make a partition in a courtyard, they build the wall in the middle. [The \"courtyard\" here is one for which there is no law of partition, there not being four cubits for each of the partners, for which reason we have \"if they wished,\" i.e., It is only if they both wished it that they do so, but one cannot compel the other to do so. For in a courtyard subject to the law of partition, each one can compel his neighbor to divide. And now we are being apprised that since they wished to divide and each one appropriated the section accorded him by mutual consent, they build the wall in the middle, each providing from his section half the space of the thickness of the wall.] In a place where it was the custom to build with untrimmed stones, planed stones, laths, [half (the width) of a brick, one and a half handbreadths to a brick's three handbreadths], or bricks, they do so — all according to the custom of the land [\"all,\" to include a place where it was the custom to make a partition with vine sprouts and tree branches. The custom of the land is followed so long as the partition is thick enough to keep each from looking into his neighbor's domain, for \"gazing damage\" is called damage. And the height of the wall or the partition may not be less than four cubits.] For (a partition of) untrimmed stone, each provides three handbreadths. For planed stones, each provides two and a half handbreadths. [A wall of untrimmed stones requires a handbreadth more than a wall of planed stones to allow for rough, projecting stone heads.] For laths, each provides two handbreadths. For bricks, each provides one and a half handbreadths. [A lath wall is a handbreadth thicker than a brick wall, for a lath is placed on either side, three handbreadths, and a handbreadth (is left) in the middle, where clay is placed to join them. The thickness of a brick wall is that of a whole brick, three handbreadths, no clay being required in the middle.] Therefore, if the wall fell, the space and the stones belong to both. [We are hereby being apprised that even if the stones fell into the domain of one of them, or if one of them came forward and cleared them into his domain — I might think that \"the burden of the proof is upon him who would exact (payment) from his neighbor\"; we are, therefore, apprised otherwise.]",
            "\tAnd so with a garden, a place where the custom is to fence, he is obligated to do so. [This is the intent: And so with a garden. It is regarded as a place that it is the custom to fence, and one who took a place there is required to fence it.] But in a valley, a place where the custom is not to fence, he is not obligated to do so. [A valley is regarded as a place where the custom is not to fence, and he is not obligated to do so.] But if he (his neighbor) wishes (to fence) he moves into his (own domain) and builds and makes a border-mark on the outside [a sign that the wall is his. The sign is described in the Gemara. He coats a cubit of the top of the wall with lime on his neighbor's side, and not his own, lest his neighbor coat his side, too, and claim that the wall belongs to both. But when he coats it only on his neighbor's side and not on his own, this is a sign that the wall is his; and if his neighbor peels it, it is noticeable (as having been peeled)]. Therefore, if the wall fell, the place and the stones are his. If they both agreed to build, they build the wall in the middle and make the border-mark on the outside, [as a sign that they both built it.] Therefore, if it fell, the place and the stones belong to both.",
            "\tIf one surrounded his neighbor (with fields) from three sides, and he fenced the first, the second, and the third, he (the neighbor) is not obligated (to share the fencing expenses), [for he (the first) did not benefit him at all, his land still being open. But if he (the first) fenced the fourth side, in which instance he definitely benefits him, he (the neighbor) is obligated to pay, nominally, half the cost of reeds (i.e., of a reed fence), but not half of his (the first's expenses. For he (the neighbor) can say to him: For me, a reed partition is sufficient, and I do not want the expense of a stone fence.] R. Yossi says: If he (the first) arose and fenced the fourth (side), all is imposed upon him (the neighbor) [that is, half of the actual fencing expenses. And this is the difference between the first tanna and R. Yossi. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi. And it goes without saying that if the surrounded one fenced the fourth side, making it evident that he favors his neighbor's fencing, all is imposed upon him, and he pays half of his neighbor's expenses.]",
            "\tIf a courtyard wall [of partners] fell, he (i.e., each one of the partners) is required to rebuild it until (a height of) four cubits, [this sufficing to prevent \"gazing damages\"]. He is deemed to have given unless it is proved that he has not given. [i.e., If one claims half the expenses and the other says that he has already given his share, he is believed, unless the claimant can bring witnesses that he claimed and the other did not give. For all know that each must give his share, and the other would not have built alone (without the first having contributed), but he would have brought him to beth-din.] From four cubits and above, he (the second) is not obligated (for half the additional height). If he adjoined another wall to it, even if he did not roof it, all is imposed upon him. [i.e., If after the first built well above four cubits and the second did not wish to assist him in it, he (the second) adjoined another wall to it in order to roof it from wall to wall — even if he had not yet roofed it, all is imposed upon him, he having made it evident that he favors the additional height.]",
            "\tHe [an occupant of a courtyard who does not wish to assist the others] is compelled to build a gate-house for the courtyard, [where the gate guard can sit in the shade and keep the passersby in the public domain from looking into the courtyard], and (he is compelled to build) a door [for the courtyard gate]. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Not all courtyards require a gate-house. [A courtyard not adjoining the public domain does not require a gate-house. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel. For even if it does not adjoin the public domain, sometimes there is a press of people and they converge upon the courtyard.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Not all cities require a wall. [A city not close to the border of the enemy does not require a wall. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel. Even if it is not close to the border of the enemy, it requires a wall, for armed bands sometimes come there.] How long must someone be in a city to be regarded as one of its inhabitants [to share in community responsibilities]? Twelve months. [But nowadays, that there is greater movement, the customary period is thirty days.] If one bought a dwelling, he is immediately regarded as a city inhabitant.",
            "\tThe courtyard is not divided until there are four cubits to each (partner). [One partner in the courtyard cannot compel the other to divide it until each has four cubits aside from the doors, each house in the courtyard requiring four cubits before the door for unloading an ass. Aside from those four cubits, an additional four cubits are required for their other purposes before the courtyard becomes subject to partition.] And a field (is not divided) until there are nine measures to each. R. Yehudah says: Until there are nine half-measures to each. [Each speaks of his own place, and they do not differ. For a nine half-measure field in the place of R. Yehudah yielded as much as a nine measure field in the place of the rabbis.] And not a garden until there is a half-measure to each. R. Akiva says: A space to sow a quarter measure. [The halachah is that fields awaiting plowing or sowing are not subject to partition until there remains for each of the partners enough land for one day of plowing, or sowing, or the like.] Nor (do they divide) a traklin or a moran [spacious dwellings], nor a pigeon coop, nor a garment, nor a bath-house, nor an olive press, until there is enough for each. [As explained below: so that after they divide and each takes his share there remains enough for each that it be called \"traklin\" or \"moran\" (or the like), i.e., that there remain in the part the name by which the whole was called.] This is the rule: Something which retains its name when it is divided, is divided; if not, it is not divided. When is this so? When both do not wish to divide. [One cannot compel the other to divide against his will; but he can compel \"god or agod,\" i.e.: Buy my part or sell me your part for what it is worth.] But when both wish (to divide), even with less than this (i.e., what is stipulated above) they may divide. And with The Holy Scriptures [Torah, Prophets, and Writings], even if they both wish to do so, they may not divide. [This, only with one volume; but with many separate books, they may divide if they so wish.]"

            "\tOne may not dig a bor [(round)] near his neighbor's bor, nor a shiach [(long and narrow)], nor a ma'arah [(roofed)], nor a water canal, nor a wash-pond [a square pit in which rain water is collected for washing clothes], unless he distances it three handbreadths from his neighbor's wall [i.e., from the wall of his hole. And the thickness of the wall of a hole is not less than three handbreadths, so that the distance from his hole to that of his neighbor is found to be six handbreadths. And one may not place one of the \"damagers\" alongside his neighbor's boundary unless he removes it the required distance, even if there is no wall there, lest his neighbor decide to build there and he cause damage to him.] And he coats [the walls of his hole] with lime. One distances olive-peel peat, and manure, and salt, and lime, and flint three handbreadths from his neighbor's wall. [For all of these \"undermine\" a wall. (The \"wall\" here is not that of a hole.)] One distances sowing, plowing, and urine three handbreadths from a wall. [(\"plowing\":) Plowing even without sowing (as when one plows for trees) undermines a wall. (\"urine\"): It erodes bricks, which are of dried clay. Therefore, if one urinates near a brick wall, he must move back three handbreadths. With a stone wall, one handbreadth suffices; and with hard stone, such as granite, he need not move back at all.] And a mill must be removed (from a wall). [(Its \"rattling\" undermines the wall's foundation)] three (handbreadths) from the shechev (the lower part), which are four from the rechev (the upper part). [The rechev \"rides\" on the shechev, and is a handbreadth narrower.] And an oven (must be removed) three from the kilya which are four from the surface. [The kilya is the base, built of clay and stones, on which the oven is placed. It is broad below and narrow above. The upper surface of the kilya, on which the oven is set, is of the same width as the oven. This base must be removed three handbreadths from the wall, four handbreadths from its upper surface, for the heat of the stove damages the wall.]",
            "\tOne may not stand an oven inside a house unless there is a height above it [from the mouth of the oven until the ceiling] of four cubits, [so that the ceiling not catch fire.] If he stood an oven in an upper story, there must be below it a [clay] paving of three handbreadths, [so that the lower ceiling (i.e., the floor) not catch fire; and a height above it of four cubits.] And with a kirah, [upon which a pot is placed, no large fire being made within it as in a stove], one handbreadth. And if he caused damage [after having observed all of the above regulations], he pays the amount of the damage, [in spite of which he is compelled to observe these regulations, lest he cause fire damage to his neighbors and not have what to pay.] R. Shimon says: All of these regulations were stated only so that if he caused damage (after having observed them), he be exempt from paying. [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]",
            "\tOne may not open a bakery or a paint shop under his neighbor's store room; nor a stable. In truth, with (a store room of) wine it was permitted, [the vapors rising from the bakery or the paint shop not harming the wine, heat improving (the quality) of wine in Eretz Yisrael. But in a place where it is known that heat harms wine, one may not open up such shops even under a store room of wine.] A shop in a courtyard may be protested against. [If one of the courtyard occupants wished to open a shop there, the others can stop him.] (He may be told:) \"I cannot sleep because of those going in and going out.\" One may make vessels (in the courtyard) and go out and sell them in the marketplace. But one may not protest and say I cannot sleep: neither because of the sound of the hammer, nor the sound of the mill, nor the sound of the schoolchildren [who learn Torah. And even though it is a sound produced by others (and not by the courtyard occupant himself), one cannot protest, because of the greater glory of Torah. And if he does not teach the children Torah, but a trade or arithmetic or fractions, one can protest and say: \"I cannot sleep because of the children going in and out.\"]",
            "\tIf one's wall were close to his neighbor's wall, [forming a right angle with it], he may not put another wall close to it unless he places it four cubits distant. [If he came to put a second wall against his neighbor's wall so that the three walls formed a kind of beth, his neighbor may stop him until he moves it four cubits away so that there be enough room between the two walls for people to walk in. For treading the ground near the wall strengthens and firms up the walls' foundations. This, only with a garden wall or a wall in the courtyard of a new city, where not many have trodden, and where the ground has not been sufficiently strengthened. But with a wall in the courtyard of an old city, he may join the walls and need not distance them. Likewise, if his neighbor's wall were shorter than four cubits, he need not distance (his wall), for a wall shorter than four cubits requires no strengthening.] And the windows — above, below, and opposite, four cubits. [If he had a window above on his wall, and his neighbor built a wall opposite his window, below it — if there were fewer than four cubits from the top of the wall that he built until the window, he may compel him to lower it, so that he not stand on top of it and look into the window. If he had a window below on his wall, he may compel him to raise the wall that he built opposite four cubits higher than the window, so that he not look into it. And opposite: He must distance the wall four cubits from the window so that he not block its light.]",

[If one had a pigeon coop in his courtyard near a wall separating two courtyards, and his neighbor came to place a ladder against the wall, he must distance the ladder four cubits from the coop so that a marten not jump from the ladder to the coop and kill the pigeons.] And a wall (must be distanced) four cubits from a mazchilah, so that he can stand a ladder (there). [A mazchilah is a large gutter running along the side of a wall for the roof water to drain into. If one's wall with a mazchilah upon it runs along his neighbor's courtyard, he (his neighbor) must distance himself four cubits from it if he comes to build a wall alongside it, so that he (the other) can stand a ladder there to go up to repair the mazchilah, to clean it of the dirt and rocks that collect there and impair the flow of the water.] A coop is distanced fifty cubits from the city, [for the pigeons spoil the roof gardens]; and he may not set up a coop in his own (field) unless he has fifty cubits on all sides [so that the pigeons not spoil his neighbor's field.] R. Yehudah says: (He must have a distance of) four korin, [a beth kor on all sides. (A kor is thirty sa'ah)], a full [single] flight of a pigeon. But if one bought it (the coop) [as it is, with the land,] even if [there were around it] only [the distance of] a quarter [kav], it remains as it was, [the first having maintained it thus.]",

If the city were first, he [the city owner] cuts it down and does not compensate (the owner of the tree); and if the tree were first, he cuts it down and compensates. If it were in doubt (which came first), he cuts it down and does not compensate. [For since it must be cut down no matter which came first, after it is cut down its owner is told: \"Prove that it was there first and you will be paid.\"]",

And a goren which does not have a large pile, where the chaff need not be winnowed with a winnowing shovel but is dispersed by the wind blowing through the pile, is called a non-fixed goren.] One may not set up a fixed goren in his own (field) unless he has fifty cubits on all sides. And he distances (it) from his neighbor's plants, and from his nir so that he not harm (them). [A nir is the plowing of the summer days aimed at killing the roots of thorns and weeds. (\"so that he not harm\":) This is the reason (for distancing) — so that the chaff not harm his plants and his nir. For it (the chaff) moulders and spoils the nir and dries up the plants.]",

Akiva says: He may set them up in all directions at a remove of fifty cubits, except west, [where he may not set them up at all, for the Shechinah is in the west.

If the pit were (there) first, he (the pit owner) cuts (down the tree) and compensates (its owner). [For since he was permitted to plant, not causing damage until after much time, the sages did not oblige him to cut (down his tree) without compensation because of the damage it might cause to an individual.] And if the tree came before the plant, he (the pit owner) may not cut it down. If it were not known which came first, he may not cut it down. R. Yossi says: Even if the pit came before the tree, he may not cut it down; for the one digs in his own (land), and the other plants in his own (land). [The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.]",

This, in Eretz Yisrael and other lands where the plow is long. But in Bavel and other lands where the plow is short, two cubits suffice. And it is only between vines and vines, and trees and trees that two cubits suffice. But if one comes to plant a tree field near vines, even in Bavel and the like, he must distance himself four cubits.] If there were a fence between them, each can plant until the fence on either side. If roots went out into his neighbor's (field), he may go down three handbreadths, so that they not stop the plow. [The owner of the field into which the roots of his neighbor's trees intruded may cut them up to a depth of three handbreadths without any reservations.] If he were digging a bor, a shiach, or a ma'arah, (see 2:1), he cuts (the intruding roots) as he goes (i.e., digs) down, and the wood belongs to him [the owner of the field. This, if the place where he were digging were sixteen cubits or more from his neighbor's tree. But if it were less than that, the wood belongs to the owner of the tree.

[If one lost his bill (of purchase), and he brought witnesses that he was in possession in each of the instances adduced in our Mishnah, he is believed to state that he is the purchaser, and he is not told: \"Bring your bill of purchase.\" For up to three years one takes care of his bill (of purchase), but not longer than that. And the claimant is told: If you had not sold it to him, you should have protested before two (witnesses): \"Know that that man is 'eating' my land in theft,\" and the matter would have come to his ears, and he would have been heedful with his bill (of purchase). For \"Your friend has a friend, and your friend's friend has a friend.\" And since you did not protest, it is your loss. (\"an irrigated field\":) Since it is constantly superintended for purposes of irrigation, it is constantly productive. And the chazakah of something which is constantly productive is three years from day to day. (\"bondsmen\":) And though we rule: \"Godroth (sheep, as in Numbers 32:16: 'gidroth tzon,' (i.e., sheepfolds) have no chazakah,\" and the same applies to all living things — it is an immediate chazakah that they do not have. That is, if the sheep or the bondsman were known to belong to one man and they entered the house of another, and the second claimed that he had bought them and was in possession of them, this is no chazakah, for they are accustomed to go from house to house. But if he held a bondsman for three years, this is a chazakah and he needs no bill of purchase.] The chazakah of a rain-fed field, [which is productive only once a year] is three years, [not requiring \"from day to day.\"] R. Yishmael says: Three months the first (year), three months the last, and twelve months in the middle — eighteen months.

Akiva says: One month in the first, one month in the last, and twelve months in the middle — fourteen months. [Some things grow in thirty days, such as young corn and greens. Therefore, if he ate from it fourteen months, it is a chazakah.] R. Yishmael said: [(R. Yishmael holds that the eating of young corn and greens does not establish a chazakah, but only the eating of real grain and fruit.)] When is this so?

And even a time which is not one of danger or war is regarded as such a time relative to them, (i.e., It is assumed that) if the owner protested, no one could apprise the holder of the land thereof. Therefore, the holder of the land should have held on to his bill(of purchase), and since he failed to do so, the loss is his.] If he (the owner) were in Judah and he (the other) held (land) in the Galil — if he were in the Galil, and he held in Judah, it is not a chazakah; but he must be with him in the same land, [e.g., both in Judah or both in Trans-Jordan, even if one were in one city, and one in another. For caravans being frequent, he should have protested; and since he did not protest, he is the loser.] R. Yehudah said: They posited three years only, in consideration of: one year for his (the owner's) being in Spain, and his (the other's) holding it, one year for their (messengers') going and apprising him (the owner), and the next year for his (the owner's) coming (and protesting). [R. Yehudah holds that the rationale for chazakah is not that one guards a bill (of purchase) for three years but not longer. For a man does not allow his land to be eaten even for one hour without protesting. Rather, the reason three years were posited is that if the owner were in Spain, etc. But if he (the owner) were with him (the holder) in the same city, then it is a chazakah immediately.

But if he said: \"You sold it to me,\" You gave it to me as a gift,\" \"Your father sold it to me,\" \"Your father gave it to me as a gift,\" this is a chazakah. And what comes through inheritance, [his having held it three years as his father's inheritance, it having belonged to his father on the day of his death] requires no claim [justifying his father's holding it. However, proof is required of his father's having lived there (at least) one day.] Craftsmen, partners, tenant-farmers, and caretakers have no chazakah. [Artisans, who repair vessels, have no chazakah. If they hold the vessels of others, they cannot claim to have acquired them, even if they are not the type of vessels which are wont to be lent or rented. This, when the vessel is before us in the hand of the craftsman. But if the vessel is not before us in the hand of the craftsman, but one came and claimed that he had given the craftsman a vessel to repair and asked that it be returned, and the craftsman replied that he had it, but that the other had sold it to him, the craftsman is believed with a miggo, viz. Had he wished, he would have denied ever having received it; or he could have claimed that he had returned it. Likewise, if the craftsman claimed that the other had agreed to pay him a certain amount and the other said that it was less, if the vessel is before us in the hand of the craftsman, the owner of the vessel is believed. And if not, the craftsman is believed with an oath, even if he (the owner) had given it to him with witnesses — miggo: Had he wished, he could have said: \"I returned it to you.\" (\"partners\":) If two hold land in partnership, and one of them ate all of the fruits for three years, this is no chazakah. This, when there is no law of division for the land (see 1:6); but if there is, and one of them ate for three years, it is a chazakah. (\"tenant-farmers\":) who go down (to get a portion) of the (produce of the ) land — a half, a third, or a fourth. If they ate all of the fruits for three years, this is not a chazakah. And this, only with the tenant-farmers of fathers' houses, who are like caretakers for the children. But others, whom the owners themselves brought down (to the land) — If they ate all of the fruits for three years, it is a chazakah.] A man has no chazakah in the property of his wife. [Even if he wrote her while she were still betrothed: \"I have no rights to your property nor to its produce,\" in which instance he does not eat the fruits by right, and then he brought proof that he ate fruits for three years, it is not a chazakah. For women tend to allow their husbands to eat the fruits of their property, whether by right or not by right.] And a woman has no chazakah in the property of her husband. [Even if he set aside land for her sustenance and she ate fruits form other lands of her husband for three years, still, it is not a chazakah. For men tend to allow their wives to eat of their property even if they have no rights to it.] And a father has no (chazakah) in the property of his son, and a son, in the property of his father. [For they are like caretakers vis-à-vis each other.] When is this so? [that it is not a chazakah] With holding, [i.e., with one's holding under protest, his neighbor claiming it to be stolen.] But one who gives a gift [(before us and says to the receiver: \"Go, take hold and acquire,\" etc.) All of those mentioned above in the Mishnah as not having a chazakah, when they \"take hold\" (of the object) they are as all receivers of gifts; they do acquire, and the giver cannot retract. And a woman who gave or sold to her husband her melog property (see Yevamoth 4:3) — when the husband \"takes hold\" of it, he acquires it, and she cannot say: \"I was just giving pleasure to my husband.\" For it is only with tzon-barzel property, or with land that her husband set aside for her kethubah that we say her sale is no sale and her gift is no gift in that she can say: \"I was just giving pleasure to my husband.\" For her husband has some connection with those lands. But with melog property with which he has no essential connection whatsoever, she cannot say: \"I was just giving pleasure to my husband.\" Likewise, a man who sold some of his property to his wife — If the money whereby she acquired it were not \"secreted with her,\" the sale stands; the property reverts to the woman, and the husband eats fruits. And if that money were secreted with her, the sale is void. For he can say: \"I 'concocted' the sale only to 'ferret out' the money secreted with her.\"] (\"But one who gives a gift\") and brothers who divide (the inheritance), [ (each, \"taking hold\" of his portion, cannot retract.) ] and one who \"takes hold\" of the property of a proselyte, [(who died without heirs, in which instance whoever is first to take hold of his property acquires it)] — If he made somewhat of a door, or of a wall, or of a breach [in it], this is a chazakah.",
            "\tIf two testified that he had eaten (from the field) three years, and they were found to be zomemim (scheming witnesses - See Deuteronomy 19:19), they pay him (the field's owner) everything. If two (testified for the first year, two for the second, and two for the third (and they were found to be zomemim), they \"third\" it among themselves. [Each pair gives a third, for they are three pairs for three years.] If they were three brothers, [one brother for each year], and another joining them [i.e., testifying with each of them] they constitute three testimonies [For what one (pair) testifies, the other does not, for which reason their testimony is kasher], and they constitute one testimony for [purposes of] hazamah (scheming witness), [so that if they are found to be zomemim, they \"third\" it among themselves.

[This tanna is speaking of a courtyard of partners, where they do not object to (the other's) keeping a beast or the like. For this reason, it is not a chazakah even if one held it for this purpose for three years.] But if he made a partition for his beast ten handbreadths high, and so for an oven, and so for a mill; and if he brought chickens into his (neighbor's) house, or made a place for his fertilizer three (handbreadths) deep or three (handbreadths) high, it is a chazakah. [For in such an instance one would certainly object, so that if he remained silent for three years and did not protest, it is certainly a chazakah. Maimonides explains that with a partner, who objects to the erecting of a partition, if his partner made a partition and he did not object, it is a chazakah immediately. But with one in general (i.e., not a partner), even if he made a partition and the other did not protest, it is not a chazakah until after three years.]",

But if he came to turn it around, e.g., if it were positioned in the south, and he came to position it in the north, the owner of the marzev cannot stop him, for he loses nothing thereby, and he has no chazakah that it was always positioned on one side. \"marzev\" — the place whence the drop of rain flows. \"mar\" = a drop, as in (Isaiah 40:15): \"Behold, nations are as a drop (mar) out of a bucket.\"] Chazakah does obtain with a mazchilah [a roof gutter. Being a fixed object, it has a chazakah.] Chazakah does not obtain with an Egyptian ladder. [Since it is small and not fixed, one does not object to another's placing it in his courtyard in order to go up to his (own) roof or dove-cote, for which reason it has no chazakah.] Chazakah does not obtain with an Egyptian window. [A small aperture, not large enough for a man's head to go through has no chazakah. And if the owner of the courtyard wishes to build opposite the window and block it, the owner of the window cannot tell him: \"I already have a chazakah in it, and you may not block it.\" For the other can tell him: \"I allowed it only because it caused me no damage.\" And even so, if he wished, he could have stopped him from making it in the first place, even if it were higher than four cubits. For he could have told him: \"(I object), for you might put a bench under the window to gaze at me.\" And after having allowed him to make it, too, he has no chazakah.] And chazakah obtains with a Tyrian window, [an aperture through which a man's head can fit, even if it is higher than four cubits. Or an aperture made to admit light, even if it is very small. Or a window below four cubits. All of these three apertures — If one allowed them to be made, chazakah obtains with them, and he (the owner of the courtyard) can no longer build opposite them and block them. For chazakah obtains where there is (acquiescence in) damages, with the exception of (damages of) smoke, dust, and privy (i.e., a foul odor), chazakah not obtaining with these three, even after the passage of many years. But chazakah does obtain with (acquiescence in) sight damages. And three years of chazakah are not required for damages; but it obtains as soon as he (the \"damager\") can tell the damaged one: \"You experienced the damage and did not protest.\"] Which is an Egyptian window? Whatever a man's head cannot fit through. R. Yehudah says: If it has a frame, [such as a lintel above and a cross-piece below], even if a man's head cannot fit through, chazakah obtains with it. A ziz [wood or stone projecting from a wall into the courtyard of one's neighbor], until a handbreadth, chazakah obtains with it. [If it is a handbreadth or more, chazakah obtains with it and the owner of the courtyard may not build against it and block the ziz, the other having a chazakah in it.] And he can protest. [If the owner wishes to insert a ziz, a handbreadth or more, the owner of the courtyard may protest against his doing so.] With less than a handbreadth chazakah does not obtain, and he cannot protest. [If it is less than a handbreadth, it is not a fixed object, for which reason chazakah does not obtain with it, so that the other may build against it and block it.

But if he wishes, he may build a room inside his house, [in which instance he adds nothing, but simply divides his house in two.

R. Yochanan b. B'roka says: If he says this about one who is fit to inherit him, his words stand. And if about one who is not fit to inherit him, his words do not stand. [e.g., If he said it about one son among the other sons, or about one daughter among the other daughters, his words stand, it being written (Deuteronomy 21:16): \"Then it shall be, on the day that he causes his sons to inherit\" — The Torah granted the father authority to cause whichever of his sons he wishes, to inherit him. And R. Yochanan concedes that with a brother, where he has a daughter, or with a daughter, where he has a son, he has said nothing. For a daughter is not fit to inherit where there is a son; or a brother, where there is a daughter. Likewise, R. Yochanan concedes that if he made the bechor equal to the other brothers, he has said nothing, it being written (Ibid.): \"He shall not be able to grant primogeniture, etc.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Yochanan b. B'roka.] If one writes his property over to others, passing over his children, what he did is done, but the sages do not look favorably upon it, [even if his children to not deport themselves properly, for good children might issue from them.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: If his children did not deport themselves properly (and he disinherited them thus), he is \"remembered for the good.\" [The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel.]",
            "\tIf one says: \"This is my son,\" he is believed, [to cause him to inherit and to exempt his (own) wife from yibum (levirate marriage)]. (If one says:) \"This is my brother,\" he is not believed, [to cause him to inherit with his brothers, for they do not recognize him.] And he (the one called \"my brother\") takes (i.e., shares) with him (the one who calls him his brother) in his portion. [So that if there were two brothers aside form the safek (the \"doubtful\" one), and there were three fields for them to divide, one takes one and a half, and the other takes one and a half, and the one who calls the safek his brother gives him half the field, and the other gives him nothing, saying: \"Bring proof and take.\"] If he [the safek] dies, the property [given to him by his brother] returns to its place, [i.e., to the one who gave it to him; but the other brothers do not inherit him.] If property fell to him [the safek] from elsewhere [in his lifetime, or if he bought property and then died], his brothers inherit with him [the one who testified about him. For he (the safek) admitted to them that he is their brother. This, when the other brothers do not absolutely deny that he is their brother, but only say that they do not recognize him. But if they do deny it, only the one who testified for him inherits him.] If one died, and a daitiki [a deathbed will (\"daitiki\" - \"da tehei lemeikam ulemehevei\" — \"This shall be to establish and to confirm\")] were found tied to his thigh, [in which instance it cannot be maintained that another wrote it and placed it there, even so], it is nothing, [for acquisition is effected only with transference of the writ, and \"there is no writ after death.\"] If he invested another with it, whether one of the heirs, or one not an heir, his words stand.",
            "\tIf one writes over his property to his sons, he must write: \"from today and after death,\" [connoting: The land itself is acquired by you from today, and you shall not eat its fruits until after (my) death. And if he does not write \"from today,\" he gives him nothing, for there is no giving after death.] These are the words of R. Yehudah. R. Yossi says: He need not [write \"from today.\" For since it is written in the deed: \"On this and this day of the week, so and so said to us: 'Be witnesses for me, etc.'\", the date indicates that the gift \"began\" on that day. For if this is not so, why need the date be written at all? The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.] If one writes over his property to his son after his death, [i.e., \"from today and after death\"], the father cannot sell it [without the son], for it is written over to the son, [i.e., the land itself is owned by the son], and the son cannot sell it [without the father], for it is in the father's domain [i.e., the fruits are owned by the father.] If the father sold it [without qualification], they [the fruits] are sold (to the buyer) until he [the father] dies. If the son sold it [in the father's lifetime], the buyer does not have them [the fruits] until the father dies. The father [who wrote over his property to his son \"from today and after death\"] tears off and feeds [the fruits] to whomever he wishes [in his lifetime. But as to what was left in the ground at the time of his death, even though it stands to be torn out, it belongs to his son, the receiver of the gift. However, if one writes over his property to another, even what is left in the ground at the time of his gift belongs to the heirs. For a man is more favorably disposed towards his son than towards another.] And what was left over, torn (from the ground) belongs to the heirs. If he left sons, grown and small, the grown ones are not clothed at the expense of the small [(The clothing expenses of the grown ones are greater than those of the small)], and the small ones are not fed at the expense of the grown ones. But they share equally. [(The food expenses of the small ones are greater than those of the grown, for they eat more often and leave over more.) Therefore, the small ones keep the grown ones from being clothed by the estate, and the grown ones keep the small ones from being fed by it, but each is clothed and fed from his own share.] If the grown sons married [and took their wedding expenses from the estate after the death of their father], the young ones may also marry [i.e., they may also take their wedding expenses from the estate.] And if the younger ones said [after the death of their father]: \"We shall marry as (i.e., in the same style that) you did\" [in our father's lifetime], they are not heeded, but whatever their father gave them [in his lifetime], he gave.",
            "\tIf he left over daughters [and not sons], the grown ones are not clothed at the expense of the small, and the small are not fed at the expense of the grown, but they share equally. If the grown daughters married, the young ones may also marry. And if the younger ones said: \"We shall marry as you did,\" they are not heeded. This is a stringency of daughters over sons: Daughters are fed [as a condition of the kethubah] at the expense of the sons, whereas they [small daughters] are not fed at the expense of the [grown] daughters. [For where sons do not inherit, the daughters are not fed by condition of the kethubah, but they share equally, and each is fed from her own portion.]"

        [
            "\tIf one died and left sons and daughters — When the inheritance is ample, [sufficient to feed the sons and the daughters until the daughters are grown], the sons inherit and the daughters are fed (by them). When the inheritance is scant, [i.e., insufficient for the above], the daughters are fed (from it) and the sons go soliciting at the doors. Admon says: \"Because I am a male shall I lose out!\" [i.e., I should not lose out; we should all be fed together.] R. Gamliel said: \"I concur with Admon.\" [The halachah is not in accordance with Admon. And they (the sages) made a widow in respect to a daughter with scant property like a daughter in respect to brothers, viz.: Just as with a daughter in respect to brothers, the daughter is fed and the sons solicit at the doors, so with a widow in respect to a daughter. The widow is fed and the daughter solicits at the doors.]",
            "\tIf one left sons and daughters and a tumtum [one whose gender, male or female, is in doubt], the males \"push him off\" to the females, [saying to him: \"Prove that you are a male and share\" (with us in the inheritance)]. Where there is scant property, the females \"push him off\" to the males, [saying to him: \"Prove that you are a female and be fed with us.\"] If one says: \"If my wife bears a male, let him get one hundred,\" if she bore a male, he gets one hundred. [And even though we rule that \"if one endows a fetus, it does not acquire,\" here we are speaking of a deathbed gift to one's son, a man being (more) favorably disposed towards his son (than to others)]. (If one says: \"If my wife bears a female, (let her get) two hundred,\" if she bore a female, she gets two hundred. (If she said:) \"If a male, one hundred; if a female, two hundred,\" if she bore a male and a female [twins], the male gets one hundred and the female, two hundred. If she bore a tumtum, it does not get anything. [This Mishnah is rejected, and the halachah is that a tumtum gets the least (amount) of the two.] If he said: \"Whatever my wife bears, let him get…\" (and it turns out to be a tumtum), it gets. And if there is no other heir, it inherits everything. [We might think that a tumtum is a distinct type of being and not fit to inherit; we are, therefore, apprised otherwise.]",
            "\tIf one left over sons, grown and small — If the grown ones improved the property [while it was still part of the estate, they have improved it for all (i.e., all share equally in the improvement). [This, when the property improved through the property itself, the brothers not having spent anything of their own, but having hired workers from (the proceeds of) their father's property, the property improving \"of itself.\" But if they themselves dug and planted and spent what was theirs, then what they improved, they improved for themselves.] If they said: \"See what our father left us! We shall work (the land) and eat!\", they have improved it for themselves. Likewise, if a woman improved the property, she has improved it for all. If she said: \"See what my husband left me! I shall work (the land) and eat!\", she has improved it for herself. [The Gemara construes this as an instance of a woman's having inherited, e.g., Reuven married the daughter of Shimon, his brother, and died without children, and the daughters of Shimon, his (deceased) brother, inherit him (Reuven). It is found, then, that his (Reuven's) wife, the daughter of Shimon, his brother, inherits him with her other sisters. We might think that because of the reputation she receives as a woman who can \"manage (property) and improve (it),\" even if she said: \"See what my husband left me, etc.!\", she is willing to waive what she expended and to share the improvement with the others; we are, therefore, apprised that she has improved it for herself.]",

But if he secured it through his sharpness, his eminence, or his wisdom, then his profit is his.] If he fell ill and were healed, he is healed at his own expense. [If he fell ill accidentally, i.e., if he were not neglectful of his health, he is healed from the common fund. But if he fell ill through (excess) of cold or heat, and the like, of which it is written (Proverbs 22:5): \"He who guards his soul will stay far from them,\" of this it is stated in the Mishnah that he is healed at his own expense.] If some of the brothers provided shushbinuth in the father's lifetime — if the shushbinuth returns, it returns to all; for shushbinuth is exacted in beth-din. [\"Shushbinuth\" — one's taking a meal and a gift to the chuppah (the marriage ceremony) and eating with the groom — who reciprocates when the other takes a wife. And if the father sent shushbinuth, without qualification, with one of his sons, and it returned after the father's death, it returns to all. For it is regarded as a loan, being exactable in beth-din. For one who takes shushbinuth to his neighbor can return and claim it from him in beth-din in corresponding circumstances, i.e., that the marriage of the second be as that of the first — if (marriage with) a virgin, a virgin; if a widow, a widow; if in public, in public; if in private, in private. For the second can say to the first: \"I shall do with you only as you did with me.\"] But if one sends to his neighbor pitchers of wine or pitchers of oil [without a chuppah, or with a chuppah, but without going to eat with him], it is not exacted in beth-din, for it is (an act of) lovingkindness (alone) [i.e., It is not shushbinuth, but a gift.]",

But if he ate less than that, he is not presumed to have waived them and he reclaims them.] If he did not eat the groom's feast there, they are reclaimed. If he sent many betrothal gifts, to return with her to her husband's house, they are reclaimed. [And even if he sent few, but specified that they were to be returned with her to her husband's house, they are reclaimed. The common instance is stated, it being the custom to send many gifts to be returned with her to her husband's house; and those that were sent her to adorn herself with in her father's house were generally few.] If he sent a few, to be used in her father's house, they are not reclaimed.",

If he did not leave over any land, his gift does not stand. [The same applies if he left over movables. And if he rose (from his sickbed), he cannot retract. This, if he (the recipient) acquired that gift from his hand. For a limited gift of a sh'chiv mera requires a kinyan (an act of acquisition), whether or not he recovers. And if the recipient did not acquire it from his hand, he does not acquire it even if he died. This, only when he wishes to confer the gift while alive; but if he instructed that something be given to someone after his death, a kinyan is not required, even if he reserved something for himself. And a sh'chiv mera who wished to confer a gift while alive, if he reserved nothing for himself, and he recovered, he may retract, even if it was acquired from his hand. And when he so instructs because of (what he thinks is his) impending death (as when we hear him say: \"Woe unto me, for I am going to die!\"), he may always retract, whether or not he reserved something for himself, and even if it were acquired from his hand. And if he died, the other acquires the gift, even without a kinyan.] If he did not write him (in the deed of gift) \"sh'chiv mera\" [i.e., \"when he was sick in bed,\" or an expression connoting health, e.g., \"when he was walking on his feet in the marketplace,\" and he left over nothing] — If he says: \"I was a sh'chiv mera\" [and I retract], and the other says: \"You were well\" [and you cannot retract], he must bring proof that he was a sh'chiv mera. [For we follow the present state. Since he is well now, he must bring proof that he was a sh'chiv mera at the time of the gift.] These are the words of R. Meir. And the sages say: [We do not follow the present state, but we say that] the burden of proof is upon him who would exact (payment) from his neighbor.

[R. Eliezer does not hold that the words of a sh'chiv mera are \"as written and transmitted,\" so that even if one instructs (that his property be given to another) because of his impending death, his gift is no gift without a kinyan, just as that of one in good health. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Eliezer.] They (the sages) said to him: Once, the mother of the sons of Rochel was sick, and she said: \"Give my daughter my k'veinah; [(The Targum of (Isaiah 3:23): \"redidim\" (veils) is \"k'veinata\"] it is worth twelve maneh,\" and she died; and they acted upon her words! He (R. Eliezer) said to them: \"The sons of Rochel — let their mother bury them!\" [i.e., No proof is to be adduced from them, for they were wicked, and the rabbis penalized them by upholding their mother's gift to the daughter, though it was not halachically valid.] And the sages say: On Shabbath, his (the sh'chiv mera's) words stand, for he cannot write; but not on a weekday [i.e., if he divided his property on a weekday.] R. Yehoshua says: They stated it for Shabbath — a fortiori (that it obtains) for a weekday. [And this is the halachah — that both on Shabbath and on a weekday, the words of a sh'chiv mera are \"as written and transmitted\" and require no kinyan. And if he requests that they acquire it from his hand, they do so both on a weekday and on Shabbath so that he not become delirious.] A parallel instance: One can effect acquisition for a minor, but not for a grown person.

Yossi said to him: \"It is better for him [the lender] thus\" [that the borrower be required to guard his receipt, so that he hasten to repay the (entire) debt], and this one's [the lender's] power should not be weakened [by having to write another bill ( of indebtedness). For the date of his (original) debt was earlier, and now (with a new bill), it will be later, and he will be able to seize bound property only from the time of the second bill. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi, that a receipt is written.]",
            "\tIf there were two brothers, one poor and one rich, and their father left them a bathhouse and an olive press — If he made them for profit, the profit falls between them; if he made them for personal use, the rich brother may tell the poor one: \"Get yourself bondsmen and let them bathe in the bathhouse; get yourself olives, and come and press them in the olive press.\" [(\"Get yourself bondsmen\": to heat the bathhouse for you. For just as our father left it, so will it be forever. And though it was taught in the first chapter that with something for which there is no law of division, one can say: \"You sell me\" (your share) \"or I will sell you\" (my share), it is different here, for the poor brother cannot say that he will buy the other's share, having nothing with which to buy it.] If there were two men in one city called \"Yosef ben Shimon,\" they cannot issue a bill of indebtedness against each other, [for each can claim: \"This bill in your hand — I returned it to you when you paid me the money that I lent you.\"], and another cannot issue a bill of indebtedness against them. [For each can \"shunt him off\" to the other.] If among one's bills there were found a paid bill of \"Yosef ben Shimon,\" the bills of both are (accounted) paid. What can they do? (to avoid this confusion)? They \"third.\" [i.e., they write the name of the grandfather.] And if they were \"thirded\"? [i.e., if their names, their fathers' names, and their grandfathers' names were the same], they write a sign, [e.g., \"the one who is red-spotted,\" or \"long,\" or \"short.\"] And if they were alike in their signs, they write \"Cohein\" [if one were a Cohein, and the other, an Israelite.] If one says to his son: \"A bill among my bills is paid, and I do not know which one,\" the bills of all (his debtors) are paid. If there were found for one (borrower) two (bills, from two loans that he made of him), the larger is (considered) paid, and the smaller, not paid. [For he said \"one bill\" among his bills, and not two.] If one lends his neighbor through a guarantor (arev), he does not exact payment from the guarantor [first] [before claiming (payment) from the borrower first and having him declared liable in beth-din, after which — if he has nothing to pay with — he exacts from the guarantor.] And if he said: \"on condition that I exact payment from whom I wish,\" he exacts payment form the guarantor. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: If the borrower has property, in either event, he does not exact payment from the guarantor. [Not that the first tanna says that if the borrower has property he does exact payment from the guarantor. But the Mishnah is defective, and this is what was taught: \"If one lends his neighbor through a guarantor, he does not exact payment from the guarantor. And if he said: 'On condition that I exact payment from whom I wish,' he exacts payment from the guarantor. When is this so, when the borrower has no property; but if the borrower has property, he does not exact payment from the guarantor. And a kablan (one who undertakes to pay a debt for another) — Even though the borrower has property, he exacts payment from the kablan. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Both with a guarantor and a kablan — If the borrower has property, he does not exact payment from them.\" The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel. (\"arev\" - a guarantor, one who says: \"Give him (a loan) and I guarantee for him.\" \"kablan\": one who says: \"Give him and I will give you.\")] And, likewise, R. Shimon said: If one were a guarantor for a woman's kethubah, and her husband divorced her [and he had no property, and the guarantor has to pay for the kethubah], he (the husband) should vow to withhold benefit from her, lest they (the man and his wife) scheme against this one's property and he take back his wife. [He (the guarantor) should not pay for the kethubah until her husband vows to withhold benefit from her on public cognizance, a vow from which there is no release, so that he not be able to take her back. For we fear that he might have the intention of taking her back and eating from (the property she received for) her kethubah after having collected it from the guarantor. As to the halachah: The guarantor for a kethubah, does not commit himself and he is not bound to pay, even if the husband has no property. Why so? For he did a mitzvah, and caused her no loss. And if he guaranteed for the kethubah of his son, he does commit himself, a father \"binding\" himself for the sake of his son. And a kablan for a kethubah does commit himself (for payment), and the woman may claim it from him first, even if the husband has property — this, on condition that the husband first vows to withhold benefit from her on public cognizance.]",
            "\tIf one lends his neighbor on a bill (of debt), he (the creditor) collects from bound property. [Even if property commitment is not included therein, he collects from bound property; for we rule that (omission of) commitment is an error of the scribe, and it is as if it were included.] (If one lends his neighbor) through witnesses, he collects from free property. If he issues a writ of indebtedness [without other witnesses], he collects from free property [and not from bound property. For since witnesses are lacking, there is no \"report\" (of the debt), and (prospective) buyers (of the property) have no knowledge of it to guard themselves (from buying the property)]. If a guarantor comes forth after the signing of the bill [i.e., if after the witnesses have signed the bill, he writes: \"I, so and so, son of so and so, am a guarantor\"], he (the creditor) collects from the [guarantor] from the free property [alone. For since the witnesses are not signed on the guarantee, it is like a verbal loan]. Once, such a case came before R. Yishmael, and he said: He collects from the free property. Ben Naness said to him: He collects neither from the bound property nor from the free property. R. Yishmael: Why? Ben Naness: If one man were choking another in the marketplace and someone came along and said: \"Let him go\" (and I will pay you), he is exempt (from payment) — for he (the creditor in our instance) did not lend him on his trust (in the guarantor). But who is a guarantor who is liable? If one says: \"Lend him, and I will pay you,\" he is liable. R. Yishmael said: If one would grow wise, let him occupy himself with monetary law, for there is no department of Torah transcending that. It is like a bubbling fount. And one who would occupy himself with monetary law, let him pay attendance upon Shimon ben Naness [(\"Ben Naness said to him, etc.\":) Ben Naness holds that every guarantor (who comes forward) after the money has been given is not a guarantor, for he (the creditor) did not lend him on (the basis of) his trust in the guarantor. And even though R. Yishmael praised Ben Naness, the halachah is in accordance with R. Yishmael. And a guarantor after the money has been given requires a kinyan (an act effecting acquisition), lacking which he does not commit himself. And before the giving of the money, he does not require a kinyan.]"
