            "[If] joint owners agreed to make a division in a courtyard, they build the wall in the middle. They can build with rough stone, smooth stones, half-bricks, or bricks depending on the custom of the land. If  [the division is made of] rough-stones, each person gives three hand- breadths. If [the division is made of] smooth stones, each person gives two and a half hands-breadths. If [the division is made of] half-bricks, each person gives two hands-breadths. If [the division is made of] full bricks, each person gives one and a half handbreadths. Therefore, if the wall falls, the place where the wall and the materials were will belong to both of them.",
            "Similarly in a garden; In a place where the custom is to build a fence, one can obligate him to build one. However, in a grain field, in a place where there isn't a custom to build a fence, one cannot obligate him. Rather, if one wants [to do so], one goes within one's own [property] and builds, and makes a sign facing outwards.  Therefore, if the wall falls, the space [where the wall stood] and the bricks belong to that person. If the wall was created according to the will of both people, they build the wall in the middle, and create a sign on both sides. Therefore, if the wall falls, the space [where the wall stood] and the bricks belong to both people:",
            "If someone surrounds [the property of] his neighbor on three sides, and builds a fence on the first, second, and third side, he  [the neighbor] is not obligated [to contribute to the cost of the fence].  Rabbi Yose says, if [the neighbor] then builds a fence on the fourth side [of his property], we obligate him to contribute to the whole [fence].",
            "If the wall of a courtyard falls, we obligate him to build up to four cubits. One is assumed to have given, until one brings proof that he has not given. From four cubits and up, we do not obligate him. If he built an adjacent wall, even if he did not put the ceiling above it, we make it all incumbent upon him. One is assumed not to have given, until one brings proof of having given.",

We force a person to build for a city a wall, doors, and a deadbolt.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all cities are suitable for a wall.  How long must a person live in a city to be counted among the people of that city?  Twelve months.  If a person bought a house, he is immediately considered to be a person of that city.",
            "One may not divide a courtyard unless [it is large enough that] one person will have four cubits and the other person will have four cubits. And not a field, unless one person will have nine <i>kab</i>   [a measure of how much grain could be produced in that amount of land] and the other person will have nine <i>kab</i>. Rabbi Yehudah says: Unless one person will have nine and a half <i>kab</i> and the other person will have nine and a half <i>kab</i>. And not in a garden, unless one person will have half a <i>kab</i> and the other person will have half a <i>kab</i>. Rabbi Akiva says: A <i>beit rova</i> [a fourth of a <i>kab</i>].  And not a hall, and not a palace, and not a dovecote, and not an outer garment, and not a bathhouse, and not a oil press, unless there is a sufficient amount in [each of] them for this one person, and a sufficient amount in [each of] them for the other person. This is the general principle: Anything which may be divided and [still retain, as before] its name upon it, they may divide it. And if not, they may not divide it. When [does this apply]? When they do not both want to [divide], but when they both want to [divide], even with less than that, they may divide.  But if [the shared object is] the Holy Scriptures, even if both parties want to [divide], they may not divide. "

If it is in doubt if this came first or if this came first, one may not cut down the tree.

The legal period of possession [in order to establish ownership] for a field irrigated by rain water is three years and they need not be completed.

Rabbi Akiva says:  One month during the first year and one month during the last year and twelve months during the middle year, which makes fourteen months. Rabbi Yishmael said:  When does this apply?  With regards to a grain field, but when it comes to a field of trees , if he brought in his produce (grapes), harvested the olives and gathered in his fig harvest, this counts as three years.   ",
            "There are three separate areas of land for the purposes of <i>chazakah</i>; [obtaining land through demonstrating ownership for an extended period of time]: Judea, The Eastern Side of the Jordan and the Galilee. If the owner of a piece of land in the Galilee was currently living in Judea and someone occupied on that person's land in the Galilee, that person would not acquire said land and vice versa.  One can only acquire the land if they are living in the same region.  Rabbi Yehuda says, the reason it takes three years to acquire land through occupying it is so that if the owner were in Spain the squatter could squat for one year, people traveling to inform the owner would take one year and then one year to return with the owner's objection.

One who comes due to inheritance [from the previous owner], does not need to make a claim. Craftsmen, partners, sharecroppers and guardians cannot establish ownership through <i>chazakah</i>. A man cannot establish ownership through <i>chazakah</i> regarding his wife’s property, nor may a wife establish ownership through <i>chazakah</i> regarding her husband’s property, nor a father of his son’s property, nor a son of his father’s property. When is this so? When the person attempts to acquire the land through <i>chazakah</i>. But, when the property was given as a gift, or when brothers shared a piece of their inheritance, or when one claimed title by <i>chazakah</i> of a convert [who died without inheritors], and then he locked up, walled up or broke down anything, behold, this is <i>chazakah</i>.",

If a 2 witnesses testify about the first year, 2 about the second year and 2 about the third year, then they split the value between them.  If the witnesses were 3 brothers [who cannot testify as relatives cannot testify together], and one other witness joined them, they are considered to be 3 separate sets of witnesses but they must all be found to be false witnesses to require them to pay.

But if he built for his beast a partition ten hand-breadths high, so too for an oven, so too for a stove, so too for a mill-stone, [or] he brought fowl inside the house, or prepared for his manure a place three hand-breadths deep or three hand-breadths high, this is <i>chazakah</i>.

And the niches -  their length is four cubits long, their height is seven [handbreadths], and their width is six [handbreadths]. Rabbi Shimon says: He makes the interior of the tomb six cubits by eight, and makes thirteen niches that open up into it, four from this side, and four from the other side, and three across from [the opening] and one to the right of the opening, and one to the left. And he makes an antechamber across the face of the cave that is six [cubits] by six – like the size of a coffin and it's buriers.

A woman relative to her sons, and a wife relative to her husband, and brothers of one's mother - these bequeath [to] but do not inherit [from]. And brothers from the [same] mother [but not father] neither inherit [from] nor bequeath [to]. ",
            "The order of inheritance is thus: “If a man dies without leaving a son, you shall transfer his property to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8)—the son precedes the daughter, and all the son’s offspring precede the daughter. A daughter precedes [a man's] brothers and the daughter's offspring precede the brothers. Brothers precede the father’s brothers and the brothers’ offspring precede the father’s brothers. This is the general rule: whosoever has precedence in inheritance, his offspring also have precedence, and the father has precedence over all his offspring. ",

            "One who says, “So-and-so, who is my firstborn, shall not receive a double portion,\" [or] “So-and-so, my son, shall not inherit with his brothers,\" has said nothing, for he has stipulated against what is written in the Torah. [If] one apportioned his property to his sons by word of mouth, and [either] increased for one and decreased for another or made the first-born equal to them, his words stand. But if he stated it \"as an inheritance,\" he has said nothing. [However, if] he had written down, whether at the beginning or in the middle or at the end [of the sentence] \"as a gift,\" his words are valid. One who says, “That man So-and-shall inherit from me,” and he has a daughter; or “My daughter shall inherit from me,\" and he has a son, he has said nothing, for he has stipulated against what is written in the Torah. Rabbi Yohanan ben Baroka says:  If he refers to one who is qualified to inherit from him, his words are valid, but if he refers to one who is not qualified to inherit from him, his words his words are not valid.” One who wrote his property off to others and passed over his sons, what he has done is done, but the sages are not pleased  with him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  If has sons did not behave properly, he should be remembered for good.   ",
            "One who says “this is my son” is believed. \"This is my brother\" -  he is not believed, though [his supposed brother] does share a claim on his portion. If [the supposed brother] died, the property returns to its source. If [the supposed brother] inherited property from elsewhere, his [known] brothers inherit it together with him. [If] someone died and a will was found bound to his thigh, this counts as nothing. But if, through it, he had granted title to another, whether from among his heirs or from among those who are not his heirs, his words are valid. ",
            "Regarding one who signs his property [over] to his sons, it is necessary for him to write \"from today and after death\" - these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah.  Rabbi Yose says: He need not do so. Regarding one who signs his property [over] to his son     \"[from today and] after his death\", the father is not able to sell it because it is signed [over] to the son; and the son is not able to sell it because it is in the father's possession. If the father sells it, [the fruits] are sold until he dies. If the son sells it, the buyer has no claim on it until after the father dies. The father may pick [from the produce of that property] and feed anyone he wishes [with it], and that which he left behind that was already picked shall surely belong to the inheritors. If one left sons of the age of adulthood [as well as] minors, those who are of age are not financed at the expense of the minors, and the minors are not fed at the expense of those of age. Rather, they divide it equally.  Just as those of the age of adulthood [draw on the estate to] marry, the minors [draw on the estate to] marry. But if, [after the father died,] the minors said, \"We will marry in the manner that you married [while father was alive],\" we do not listen to them.

But if, [after the father died,] the minors said, \"We will marry in the manner that you married [while father was alive],\" we do not listen to them.
