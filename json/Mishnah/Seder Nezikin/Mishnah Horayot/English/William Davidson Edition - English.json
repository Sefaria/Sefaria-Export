            "If <b>a court</b> erroneously <b>issued a ruling</b> permitting the Jewish people <b>to violate one of all the mitzvot that are stated in the Torah, and an individual proceeded and performed</b> that transgression <b>unwittingly on the basis of</b> the court’s ruling, then <b>whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>with them,</b> or <b>whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>after them,</b> or <b>whether</b> the judges <b>did not perform</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it alone, in all these cases the individual is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering. This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he associated</b> his action <b>with</b> the ruling of the <b>court.</b> If the <b>court issued a ruling and one of</b> the judges <b>knew that they erred,</b> despite the fact that the majority ruled against his opinion, <b>or</b> if he was <b>a student and he</b> was <b>qualified to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings, and</b> that judge or student <b>proceeded and performed</b> that transgression <b>on the basis of its</b> ruling, then <b>whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>with them,</b> or <b>whether</b> the judges <b>performed</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it <b>after them,</b> or <b>whether</b> the judges <b>did not perform</b> the transgression <b>and he performed</b> it alone, in all these cases, the judge or the student <b>is liable</b> to bring an offering. This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he did not associate</b> his action <b>with</b> the ruling of the <b>court. This is the principle: One who associates</b> his action <b>with himself</b> is <b>liable, and one who associates</b> his action <b>with</b> the ruling of the <b>court</b> is <b>exempt.</b>",
            "In a case where the judges of the <b>court issued</b> an erroneous <b>ruling and they discovered that they erred and reversed their</b> decision, <b>whether they brought their atonement</b> offering for their erroneous ruling <b>or whether they did not bring their atonement</b> offering, <b>and</b> an individual who was unaware of the new ruling <b>proceeded and performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of their</b> first ruling, <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering, <b>and Rabbi Elazar says:</b> There is <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to his status and he is liable to bring a provisional guilt-offering. <b>Which is</b> the case of <b>uncertainty</b> for which one is liable to bring a provisional guilt-offering? If one <b>sat inside his house</b> and performed the transgression he is <b>liable</b> to bring a provisional guilt-offering, as he could have learned of the change in the court’s ruling. If he <b>went to a country overseas</b> and is relying on the initial ruling, he is <b>exempt.</b> <b>Rabbi Akiva said: I concede in that</b> case of one who went overseas <b>that he is closer to exemption than</b> he is to <b>liability. Ben Azzai said to him:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is this</b> person who went overseas <b>different from one who sits in his house?</b> Rabbi Akiva said to him: The difference is <b>that</b> with regard to <b>one who sits in his house it would have been possible for him to hear</b> of the court’s reversal, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>that</b> person who went overseas, <b>it would not have been possible for him to hear</b> of the court’s reversal.",
            "The mishna explains for which type of unwitting transgression based on the ruling of the court there is liability to bring an offering. In a case where the judges of the <b>court issued</b> an erroneous <b>ruling to abolish the entire essence</b> of a mitzva, not only a detail thereof, e.g., <b>they said: There is no</b> prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman</b> written <b>in the Torah,</b> or <b>there is no</b> prohibition against performing prohibited labor on <b>Shabbat</b> written <b>in the Torah,</b> or <b>there is no</b> prohibition against engaging in <b>idol worship</b> written <b>in the Torah, these</b> judges <b>are exempt,</b> as this is an error based on ignorance, not an erroneous ruling. If the judges <b>issued a ruling to nullify part</b> of a mitzva <b>and to sustain part</b> of that mitzva, <b>these</b> judges <b>are liable.</b> <b>How</b> so? An example of this is if the judges <b>said: There is</b> a prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman</b> written <b>in the Torah, but one who engages in intercourse with</b> a woman <b>who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> she experiences a discharge is <b>exempt.</b> When the woman sees a discharge of blood for one or two days during the eleven days between the end of one menstrual period and the expected start of another, the blood is assumed to not be menstrual blood. If after the second day, the next day passes without any discharge of blood, she may immerse immediately and she is ritually pure. The judges ruled erroneously that it is permitted to engage in intercourse with her on the day that she is observing a clean day, even without the day having passed and her having immersed. Another example is if they said: <b>There is</b> a prohibition against performing prohibited labor on <b>Shabbat</b> written <b>in the Torah, but one who carries out</b> objects <b>from the private domain to the public domain</b> is <b>exempt.</b> Another example is if they said: <b>There is</b> a prohibition against engaging in <b>idol worship</b> written <b>in the Torah, but one who bows</b> to the idol but does not sacrifice an offering is <b>exempt.</b> In all of these cases, <b>these</b> judges <b>are liable, as it is stated: “And the matter is hidden”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that there is liability only if <b>a matter,</b> a single detail, is hidden, <b>but not</b> if <b>the entire essence</b> of a mitzva is hidden.",
            "If the <b>court issued a ruling, and one of</b> the judges <b>knew that they erred and he said to them: You are mistaken; or if the most distinguished [<i>mufla</i>]</b> member <b>of the court was not there</b> for that session of the Sanhedrin, <b>or if one of</b> the judges <b>was</b> disqualified from serving as a judge, e.g., because he was <b>a convert, or a child born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzer</i>], or a Gibeonite, or an old man no</b> longer <b>able to</b> father <b>children, this</b> court <b>is exempt,</b> because they have not rendered a full-fledged ruling. This is derived by means of a verbal analogy, <b>as “assembly” is stated here</b> with regard to a court that issues an erroneous ruling: “And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly” (Leviticus 4:13), <b>and “assembly” is stated there</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of one who commits murder unwittingly: “And the assembly shall judge between the one who struck and the blood redeemer” (Numbers 35:24). <b>Just as</b> in the <b>“assembly” stated there,</b> with regard to the unwitting murderer, <b>all</b> the judges must be <b>fit to issue rulings, so too,</b> in the <b>“assembly” stated here,</b> with regard to the court that issued an erroneous ruling; the court will not be liable <b>unless all</b> the judges <b>will be fit to issue rulings.</b> If the judges of the <b>court issued</b> an erroneous <b>ruling unwittingly and the entire congregation performed</b> a transgression <b>unwittingly</b> on the basis of their ruling, the court <b>brings a bull,</b> as it is stated in the Torah with regard to an unwitting communal sin-offering. If the court issued the erroneous ruling <b>intentionally,</b> as they knew that their ruling was incorrect, <b>and</b> the congregation <b>performed</b> a transgression <b>unwittingly</b> on the basis of the ruling of the court, each member of the congregation <b>brings a female lamb or a female goat</b> as an individual sin-offering. If the court issued the erroneous ruling <b>unwittingly and</b> the congregation <b>performed</b> a transgression <b>intentionally,</b> i.e., with the knowledge that the ruling of the court was erroneous, <b>these</b> people <b>are exempt</b> from bringing an offering.",
            "If the judges of <b>the court issued</b> an erroneous <b>ruling and the entire congregation or a majority thereof performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of their</b> ruling, the judges <b>bring a bull</b> as an unwitting communal sin-offering. <b>And</b> if the erroneous ruling <b>involved idol worship,</b> the judges <b>bring a bull and a goat,</b> as it is written in the Torah (see Numbers 15:24); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is not the court that brings the offering, it is the people. <b>Twelve tribes,</b> each of which performed a transgression, <b>bring twelve bulls,</b> i.e., each tribe brings one, <b>and for idol worship they bring twelve bulls and twelve goats,</b> as each tribe is a congregation. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> They bring <b>thirteen bulls; and for idol worship</b> they bring <b>thirteen bulls and thirteen goats, a bull and a goat for each and every tribe and a bull and a goat for</b> the <b>court.</b> The mishna continues: If the judges of the <b>court issued a ruling, and</b> at least <b>seven tribes, or a majority of</b> each of those tribes, <b>performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of their</b> ruling, the judges <b>bring a bull; and for idol worship they bring a bull and a goat.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The <b>seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls,</b> i.e., each tribe brings one bull, <b>and</b> each of <b>the rest of the tribes,</b> i.e., those <b>that did not sin, brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of</b> the sin of the other tribes, <b>as even those who did not sin bring</b> an offering <b>on the basis of</b> the actions of the <b>sinners. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> When seven tribes sin <b>eight bulls</b> are brought as offerings, one bull for each and every tribe and one bull for the court. <b>And for idol worship, eight bulls and eight goats</b> are brought, one <b>bull and</b> one <b>goat for each and every tribe</b> and one <b>bull and</b> one <b>goat for</b> the <b>court.</b> If the <b>court of one of the tribes issued a ruling and</b> the majority of <b>that tribe performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of its</b> ruling, <b>that tribe is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>and the rest of all the tribes</b> are <b>exempt;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: One is liable</b> to bring an offering for an unwitting communal sin <b>only for rulings of the High Court alone, as it is stated: “And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that there is liability only for a ruling of the assembly, i.e., the court, of the entire people, <b>but not</b> for a ruling of <b>the assembly of that</b> particular <b>tribe.</b>"
