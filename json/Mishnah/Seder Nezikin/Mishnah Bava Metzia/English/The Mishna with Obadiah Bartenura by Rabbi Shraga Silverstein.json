            "\tTwo are holding a garment. The first says: \"I found it\"; the second: \"I found it.\" [The Gemara construes the instance in our Mishnah as one where the first was holding the strands on one side of the garment, and the second, the strands on the other side. But if they were holding onto the garment itself, the first takes as far as his hand reaches, and the second, as far as his hand reaches. And the rest, they divide equally with an oath.] The first says: \"It is all mine\"; the second: \"It is all mine.\" [i.e., I bought it, and the seller sold it to me and not to you. And the seller sold it to one of them and took the money from both of them; one, by consent, and the other, against his will. And he does not know which is which. For if he did know and he said: \"I sold it to this one,\" one witness would obtain, in which instance a Torah oath would be imposed upon the other to refute the witness. Now that he does not know, both swear this oath specified in our Mishnah. By law, they should divide without an oath; but the sages ordained that neither of them takes anything without an oath, so that a man should not go and take hold of his neighbor's garment and say: \"It is mine!\" And it was necessary for the tanna to apprise us both of \"I found it\" — (an instance of) finding a lost object, and: \"It is all mine\" — (an instance of) buying and selling. For if only the first were taught, I would say that it is only in that case that the Torah imposed an oath, one being apt to rationalize to take a lost object unlawfully, viz.: \"My friend will lose nothing. I will go and seize it and divide it with him.\" But, in the instance of buying and selling, where if he did not need it, he would not pursue the seller to buy it, the one who comes to divide with him and give half the price causes him a loss unlawfully, without a rationalization — so that I might say (unless apprised otherwise) that the rabbis did not impose an oath upon him. And if we were apprised only of buying and selling, I would say that it is only in that instance that the rabbis imposed an oath, for in that instance he might say: \"My friend gave money and I, too, gave money. Now, that I need it for myself, I will take it, and let my friend go and buy another one.\" But in the instance of a lost object, where such (a rationalization) does not obtain, I might say not (i.e., that no oath is imposed.) We are, therefore, apprised otherwise.] The first swears that he has in it no less than a half, and the second swears that he has in it no less than a half, and they divide, [He does not swear that it is all his as per his original claim, for they will not give him all of it. And if he swears that half is his, in accordance with what he is given, he vitiates his original claim of \"It is all mine.\" Therefore, he swears that he has in it no less than a half, which implies: It is all mine, as I said in the beginning; and, according to you, who do not believe me for the whole, I take an oath that I have (possession) in it, and that I have in it no less than a half.] If the first says: \"It is all mine\"; and the second: \"Half of it is mine,\" the one who says \"It is all mine\" swears that he has no less than three quarters, and the one who says \"Half of it is mine\" swears that he has no less than one quarter. The first takes three quarters, and the second, one quarter.",
            "\tIf both were riding on a beast [We are hereby apprised that riding acquires, even if he (the rider) does not lead, the beast not moving from its place], or if one were riding and the other leading [It is only when the rider moves his feet to make the animal go that the rider is equated with the leader; but if not, the leader acquires, and not the rider.], the first says: \"It is all mine,\" and the second says: \"It is all mine,\" the first swears that he has in it no less than a half, and the second swears that he has in it no less than a half, and they divide. When they concede, or when there are witnesses, they divide without an oath. [If they concede, or if witnesses come, even after it has been ruled that they are to divide with an oath, they divide without an oath.]",
            "\tIf he were riding on a beast and saw a metziah (a lost object), and he said to his friend: \"Give it to me\" — If he (the friend) took it and said: \"I acquired it\" (for myself), he acquires it. [But if he the rider) said: \"Acquire it for me,\" the rider acquires it, and the other cannot say: \"I acquired it\" (for myself)]. If after he gave it to him he said: \"I acquired it first,\" he has said nothing. [For this one (the rider) who withdrew it from his hand, acquired it; and as long as it was in the hand of the one who picked it up, it was hefker (ownerless property)].",
            "\tIf he saw a metziah and fell upon it and another came and took hold of it, the latter acquires it. [This is so only when the metziah was in the public domain, for a man's four cubits do not acquire for him in the public domain. Therefore, the one who takes hold of it acquires it. But in an alleyway, which is a path for one person, or at the sides of the public domain, where there is no press of people, one's four cubits acquire for him any metziah and object of hefker close to him in that space, and no one else is permitted to seize it — a rabbinical ordinance to prevent contention.] If he saw them (men) running after a metziah, after a \"broken\" deer, [which cannot run and is \"guarded\" in the field if others do not take it, and which is like a metziah], and after birds which cannot fly, and he said: \"My field has acquired (them) for me,\" it acquires (them) for him. [This, provided that he is standing at the side of his field and can run after them and reach them before they leave the field.] If a deer were running normally or birds flying, and he said: \"My field has acquired (them) for me,\" he has said nothing.",
            "\tThe metziah of one's minor son and daughter (belong to him) [Whoever is dependent upon his father's \"table,\" even if he is an adult is considered a minor, and his metziah belongs to his father to prevent eivah (\"hatred\"). And the metziah of a daughter, whether a minor or a na'arah (a maiden), belongs to her father, the Torah having accorded all the gains of her maidenhood to her father.], the metziah of his Canaanite bondsman and bondswoman (belong to him), [their bodies belonging to him, viz. (Leviticus 25:46): \"And you shall hold them as an inheritance.\"], and the metziah of his wife belongs to him [(a rabbinical ordinance to prevent eivah)]. The metziah of his Hebrew bondsman and bondswoman, the metziah of his divorcée, though he has not given her her kethubah, belongs to them.",
            "\tIf one found bills of indebtedness, if they contain a lien on land [in insurance of payment of the debt], he does not return them (to the creditor), for beth-din exact payment from them (sold properties). [We fear \"payment and plotting,\" i.e., it may be that it is a paid bill which fell from the lender and that his admitting: \"I did not pay\" is part of a plot between him and the creditor to extract payment from the sold properties which were bought from the debtor without security (against seizure), those properties to be divided between them.] If they do not contain a lien on land, he returns it (to the creditor), for (in that instance) beth-din do not exact payment from them. These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say: In both instances he does not return it, for beth-din exact payment from them. [They exact payment even where the bill does not contain a lien on land, for this (omission of the lien) is an error of the scribe, and we fear \"payment and plotting.\" The halachah is in accordance with the sages, And it is only in a bill where a lien is not mentioned that the sages consider it an error of the scribe and collection is made from the bound property as if the lien were written therein. But if he stated explicitly in the bill that he does not take such a lien upon himself, the sages concede that he returns it (to the creditor), for in such an instance there is no apprehension of plotting.]",
            "\tIf one found gittin (writs of divorce) of women, writs of manumission, d'yatiki [death-bed wills, (acronymic for) \"da tehei lemeikam velihyoth\" (\"This stands to be fulfilled and to be.\")], bequests, or receipts [of creditor to debtor testifying to payment of debt], he does not return them. For I say (i.e., I suspect) that they were written and he (the writer) decided against giving them.",
            "\tIf one found writs of assessment, [beth-din having assessed the property of the debtor for the creditor towards payment of the debt], writs of sustenance, [wherein the husband takes it upon himself to feed his wife's daughter. Another interpretation: (writs wherein it is stated that land of the husband is to be sold to feed his wife and daughters], writs of refusal, [wherein it is written: \"Before us this and this woman refused (to remain married to) this and this man,\" this, in an instance of an (orphaned) minor whose mother and brothers married her off, in which instance she does not require a get], writs of selection, [one (litigant) choosing one (judge) and the other choosing one, to judge their case], and (any writ of) enactment by beth-din, he returns them (to the ones for whom they were written). If he found (bills) in a chafisah [a small leather bag], or in a dluskema [a leather bag where the elderly keep their necessaries so as not to have to search for them], or a pack of bills [three or more, folded together], or a bundle of bills [lying one atop the other, length to length], he returns them, [this being a thing that has a siman (an identifying sign). For the receptacle is a siman, the owner saying: \"In such and such a receptacle did I place them.\" Likewise, \"pack\" and \"bundle\" are a siman.] And how many are a \"bundle\" of bills? Three tied together. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: If one borrowed from three, they are returned to the debtor. [If the three bills are of one debtor, who borrowed from three different men, the finder returns them to the debtor, the bills definitely having fallen from him. For if they had fallen from them (the creditors), who would have gathered them together in one place? And this, only with bills that have been certified in beth-din. But with bills that have not been certified, we fear that the three creditors might have taken them to the scribe of beth-din to have them certified and they fell from the hand of the scribe. But it is not to be feared that they fell from the scribe's hand after he certified them, for men do not leave certified bills in the hand of the scribe.] If three borrowed from one, he returns it to the creditor, [it being obvious that they fell from him. And if they were all written by the hand of one scribe, we fear that they might have fallen from the hand of the scribe and that the loan had never been made, so that they are not returned.] If he found a bill among his bills, and he does not know the nature of it [i.e., whether the debtor deposited it with him or the creditor, or whether it is partially paid and it was given to him to act as an intermediary], it remains [in his hand without being returned to either] until Eliyahu arrives. If he finds among them (his bills) a receipt [written for one of his bills], he does what is (stated) in the receipt, [and the bill is assumed to have been paid. And even though this receipt should have been in the hand of the debtor and not in that of the creditor, we assume that the debtor trusted the creditor and said: \"Give it to me tomorrow,\" and he forgot. (This, when the creditor found the bill for which the receipt was written among torn-up bills, though it itself is not torn up)]."

            "\tWhich metzioth are his (the finder's) and which must he call out? These metzioth are his: If he found scattered fruits [(It may be assumed that the owner \"despaired\" of them, and they are hefker)], scattered money [(Since it has no distinct siman, the owner \"despairs\" of it, and it is hefker, and so with all of these)], small sheaves in the public domain, [where all tread upon them, so that even if it had a siman it is obscured], rounds of figs, loaves of a baker, [which have no siman, all of them being alike; but home-made loaves do have a siman.], strings of fish, pieces of meat, wool shearings that come from their provinces, [to exclude those that come from the tradesman's house, as taught below], bundles of flax, tongues of wool [dyed] purple — these are his. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Yehudah says: Whatever has a shinui (a distinguishing difference) must be called out. How so? If he found a round [of figs] and in it a shard; a loaf, and in it money. R. Shimon b. Elazar says: All anpuria vessels need not be called out. [(\"anpuria\":) new vessels, which are not familiar to the eye, so that the owner cannot identify them as his own by visual recognition. (For sometimes a lost object is returned on the basis of such recognition, as in the instance of a Torah scholar, who does not prevaricate.) And these vessels, about which it is known that the owner cannot identify them by visual recognition, need not be returned. The halachah is in accordance with R. Shimon b. Elazar. When is this so? When they are found individually. But if they are found in twos, they must be called out, for the number is a siman. And if one finds a metziah in a broad thoroughfare in a city, where the majority are gentiles, even something with a siman, he need not call it out. And in a city with a majority of Jews, he must call it out.]",
            "\tAnd these must be called out: If he found fruits in a vessel, [which has a siman], or a vessel as it is [i.e., empty], money in a pouch, or a pouch as it is, piled fruits [The number or the place is a siman], piled money, three coins [or more], one atop the other, [The finder calls out: \"I have found coins,\" and the loser comes and says: \"There were such and such a number and they were lying one atop the other.\"], small sheaves in a private domain, home-made loaves, wool shearings taken from the tradesman's house, pitchers of wine, and pitchers of oil — these must be called out.",
            "\tIf he found behind a gappah [a wall-filling of wood or reeds] or behind a fence [of stones], tied fledglings, [tied by their wings. Since all men tie them thus, this is not a siman.], or in paths in the fields, he should not touch them. [For we assume that they were secreted there, and if they are taken, the owners will not have a siman. Therefore, they should be left there until the owners come and take them.] If he found a vessel in the rubbish heap, if it is covered, he should not touch it, [this not being a lost object about which he is exhorted (Deuteronomy 22:3): \"You shall not be able to ignore it,\" for it is guarded.] If it is not covered, he takes it and calls it out. If he found it in a heap or in an old wall, it is his. [For he can tell the owner of the heap or of the wall that it belonged to the Emorites driven out by our ancestors. This, if it be extremely mouldy, indication of its having lain there for a very long time.] If he found it in a new wall — in the outer half, it is his; in the inner half, it is the (home) owner's. [In one of the holes of a wall close to the public domain, if he found it from half the thickness of the wall facing out, it is his. For we say that one of the men in the public domain placed it there and forgot it. And the mould upon it indicates its having been there a long time, so that the owner must certainly have despaired of it. This, only in the instance of a tongue of gold, a piece of silver, and the like. But if it were a vessel, and in it money — if the mouth of the vessel faces outwards, it is his; if inwards, it is the (home) owner's. If he rented it to others, even (if he found it) inside the house, it is his, [ it not being known whose it is, and the owner's having despaired.]",
            "\tIf he found (money) in a shop, it is his. [This, where there is no siman, the one who lost it despairing of it, the shop being frequented by many people.] Between the (shopkeeper's) chest and the shopkeeper, it is the shopkeeper's. [For the shopkeeper sits before it and always takes from it and places before it and sells, and the money that he receives he places therein, so that it must have fallen from the shopkeeper's hand.] Before the money changer, it is his (the one who finds it). [For we say that it must have fallen from those who came to change money. For the table intervenes between the money changer and the money that was found; and if it were his, it should have been found between him and the chair on which the table is mounted.] Between the chair and the money changer, it is the money changer's. If one buys fruits from his neighbor, or if his neighbor sends him fruits and he finds money in it, it is his. [This, when his neighbor is a merchant, who buys this produce or these fruits from many people, so that it is not known whose it is. And since there is no siman, the owner despairs. But if the one who sold the fruits picked them himself from his own land, the money is obviously his and must be returned to him.] If it (the money) were tied, he takes it and calls it out, [the tie or the amount being a siman.]",
            "\tA garment, too, was subsumed in all these, [i.e., in (Deuteronomy 22:3): \"every lost object of your brother.\"] Why was it singled out for special mention? [(Ibid.): \"And thus shall you do with his garment\"] To serve as a paradigm, viz.: Just as a garment is characterized by possessing simanim and claimants, so, all things that possess simanim and claimants must be called out. [A garment, in general, has a siman, and all garments have owners who claim them, their having been made by men and not coming from hefker. (\"so, all things that have claimants\":) to exclude something despaired of. \"Yeush\" (\"despair\") — hearing one say: \"Woe is me for my loss!\"]",
            "\tAnd until when must he call out? Until its neighbors know (about it) [the neighbors of the place where the lost object was found, it possibly being theirs.] These are the words of R. Meir. R. Yehudah says: Three festivals. And after the last festival, seven days, so that he can go to his house three, and return three, and call out one day. [(\"so that he can go to his house three days\":) after hearing it called out so that he can ascertain whether he has lost anything. And if he sees that he did lose something, he returns three, and calls out one day: \"I have lost it, and these are its simanim.\" The halachah is in accordance with R. Yehudah. And from the time of the destruction of the Temple, they ordained that it be called out in the houses of prayer and the houses of study. And with the increase of the \"ravishers,\" who say: \"All lost objects (that are found) go to the king,\" they ordained that he inform his neighbors and acquaintances, and this suffices.]",

And if he is (known as) a deceiver, even if he does give its simanim, it should not be returned to him, it being written (Deuteronomy 22:2): \"until you seek out your brother\" — until you seek out your brother to determine whether or not he is a deceiver. Whatever (animal) works and eats [i.e., If the lost animal is one whose work is worth the cost of its food, such as an ox or an ass], let it work and eat [and let the finder not sell it. For everyone prefers his own beast, with which he is familiar and which he has trained to its will. And he (the finder) need not care for it forever, but for a hen and a large beast, twelve months; for grazing calves and foals (i.e., those which are not raised for fattening), and, likewise, for kids and lambs, three months. For fattening calves, thirty days; for small ganders and roosters, thirty days; for large ones, which eat a lot, three days. From that point on, he takes them for himself at their estimated cost, or sells them to others and holds onto the money.]; whatever does not work and eat, let it be sold, it being written (Ibid.): \"Then you shall return it to him\" — See how to return it to him. What is to be done with the money? R. Tarfon says: He may use it. Therefore, if it is lost, he must make restoration. [Since the rabbis permitted him to use it, even if he does not use it, it is as if he did, and he must make restoration. R. Akiva says: He may not use it. Therefore, if it is lost, he need not make restoration. [The halachah is in accordance with R. Tarfon vis-à-vis the money received for the sale of the lost object; but found money itself, as when he finds money in a pouch, or three coins one atop the other, may not be used at all.]",
            "\tIf one found books, he reads in them once in thirty days, [for they become mouldy if they remain unopened. (All of their books were in the form of scrolls)]. And if he does not know how to read, he rolls them [from beginning to end, so that air enter.] But he should not learn in them ab initio [what he never learned before, for (in that instance) he must leave them (exposed) before him.] And another should not read with him. [For one pulls (the scroll) to him, and the other, to him, and it is torn.] If he found a garment, he shakes it out once every thirty days, and he spreads it out for its need [i.e., to air it out so that it not become moth-eaten.], but not for his honor. (If he found) vessels of silver or copper, he uses them for their need, [for they become mouldy in the ground, where he must keep them, this being their \"guarding.\" Therefore, he uses them from time to time], but not [so long as] to wear them out. (If he found) vessels of gold or glass, he may not touch them until Eliyahu comes. [Gold does not mould in the ground, and glass, too (does not). What is more, it is easily broken.] (If he found) a sack or a box, or anything else that he does not customarily carry, [i.e., something demeaning to him], he should not take it, [it being written (Deuteronomy 22:1): \"And you shall ignore them\" — Sometimes you are to ignore them, as in the instance of an elder whose dignity it does not befit.]",

[where it is evident that the owner is unaware if its whereabouts.] If he found an ass or a cow grazing on the road, this is not an aveidah [and he is not obliged to return it, it having been left there knowingly.] (If he found) an ass and its gear overturned, a cow running between the vineyards, [injuring its legs thereby], this is an aveidah. If he returned it and it ran away; returned it, and it ran away — even four or five times — he must keep on returning it, it being written (Deuteronomy 22:1): \"Return shall you return them.\" [The Torah added many \"returnings.\"] If he lost a sela (of working time in returning the aveidah), he may not tell him (the owner): \"Give me a sela,\" [for the other can tell him: \"Had you done your own work, you would have exerted yourself more. Take, then, the amount of your exertion.\"], but he gives him his wage as an idle worker, [i.e., the reduction in pay one would take to be idle from his regular, more difficult work, in order to do this work (of returning the aveidah)]. If there is a beth-din there, he makes a condition before beth-din. [If he does not wish to idle himself from his work, his wage being high, what does he do?

If you agree to my receiving my regular wage, I shall undertake to return this aveidah.\"] If there is no beth-din there, before whom shall he make a condition?

(Deuteronomy 22:1): \"Return shall you return them to your brother,\" and the uncleanliness of a Cohein (involves transgression of) the positive commandment of (Leviticus 21:6): \"Holy shall you be,\" and the negative commandment of (Ibid. 1): \"For a dead body he shall not become unclean among his people.\" And a positive commandment does not override a negative and a positive commandment. If his father said to him: \"Become unclean\" (to return an aveidah), or if he said to him: \"Do not return it\" [and the aveidah were in a place where it is a mitzvah to return it], he should not heed him, it being written (Ibid. 19:3): \"A man, his mother and his father you shall fear, and my Sabbaths you shall keep\": If your father tells you to desecrate the Sabbath, do not heed him. The same is true for all of the mitzvoth.] If he unloaded and loaded (a beast), unloaded and loaded, even four or five times, he is liable (to continue doing so), it being written (Exodus 23:5): \"Help shall you help.\" If he (the owner of the ass) went and sat down (doing nothing), telling him: \"Since it is your mitzvah, if you want to unload, unload,\" he is exempt, it being written (Ibid.): \"with him.\" But if he (the owner) were old or sick, he is obligated (to perform the mitzvah by himself.) It is a mitzvah of the Torah to unload [gratis], but not to load [gratis, but for pay]. R. Shimon says: Also to load [gratis. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.] R.

Likewise, if two made a claim against someone, each one saying: \"My father deposited a maneh with you,\" and he saying: \"The father of one of you did so, but I do not know which,\" each one of them swears that his father deposited a maneh with him, and he gives each one a maneh, being guilty of dereliction.

            "\tGold acquires silver, and silver does not acquire gold. Copper acquires silver, and silver does not acquire copper. [Everything which is regarded as currency and passes readily in trade has the status of money and does not acquire its counterpart which is not regarded as currency and does not pass as readily in trade. The latter has the status of fruit, and pulling it is an act of confirmation. Therefore, when one pulls dinars of gold, the other acquires dinars of silver wherever they are, and neither of them can back out. For dinars of gold are fruits relative to dinars of silver. And silver does not acquire gold. For dinars of silver, which pass readily in trade, have the status of money relative to dinars of gold. So that if one of them pulled dinars of silver, the other does not acquire a dinar of gold until he pulls it, for money does not effect acquisition. And this is the reason, too, that copper acquires silver. For p'rutoth of copper, which are not so readily accounted currency, are fruits relative to dinars of silver, and silver does not acquire copper.] Bad [i.e., invalidated] money acquires good money, and good money does not acquire bad money. An asimon [(a metal piece) shaped as a coin, but, as yet, unstamped with a design] acquires a coin, and a coin does not acquire an asimon. Mitaltelin (movable objects) acquire a coin, but a coin does not acquire mitaltelin. This is the rule: All mitaltelin acquire each other. [If one were exchanged for the other, pulling the one effects acquisition of the other. \"All\" comes to include even (an exchange) of one pouch full of money for another.]",

[This is an ordinance of the sages. For by Torah law money effects acquisition, as we find in respect to hekdesh (consecrated property): \"And he shall give the money and it shall be his.\" (see Leviticus 27:19). And why did they say that pulling effects acquisition, but not money? A decree, lest the buyer leave his purchase in the house of the seller a long time, and a fire break out in the vicinity of the seller, and he fail to exert himself to rescue it. Therefore, it was placed in his (the seller's domain), to back out of the sale if he wishes. So that if it rises in value, it does so in his domain, and he may back out of the sale and gain thereby. It being considered his, he will exert himself to rescue it.] But they said: \"He who exacted punishment of the men of the generation of the flood and the generation of the Tower of Babel — He is destined to exact punishment of him who does not keep his word.\" [Even though he may back out, (if he does so) he is cursed in beth-din and told: \"He who exacted punishment of the generation of the flood, and the generation of the Tower of Babel, and the men of Sodom and Amorah, and of the Egyptians, who drowned in the sea — He is destined to exact punishment of him who does not keep his word,\" after which he (the seller) returns his money.] R. Shimon says: Whoever holds the money has the upper hand. [R. Shimon refers here to the words of the first tanna, viz.: \"If he gave him money and did not pull fruits from him, he (either the seller or the buyer) can back out.\" R. Shimon comes to tell us that sometimes the one who holds the money (that is, the seller, who received the money) has the upper hand, and he can confirm the sale if he wishes, without the buyer being able to back out. As in an instance where the buyer's upper story is rented to the seller, in which instance, if the seller wishes that the sale be confirmed, the buyer cannot back out, even if he did not pull the money. For why did the rabbis say that pulling effects acquisition? A decree, lest the seller say to the buyer: \"Your grain was burned in the upper story.\" But here, where the upper story belongs to the buyer, if a fire breaks out, he himself will exert himself and retrieve it. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon. But even if the buyer's upper story is rented to the seller, so long as he did not pull it, both buyer and seller can back out.]",

[This, only between the wine pressing seasons. For since this was the custom, there is no misrepresentation here, all wines being of this nature.]",

Yehudah says: \"A shopkeeper should not hand out parched ears and nuts to children because he thereby accustoms them to come to him. The sages permit it. And he may not sell below the market price [because he thereby accustoms people to come to him and constricts his neighbor's livelihood.] The sages say: \"May he be remembered for the good!\" [For this brings the price down. And this is the halachah.] One may not sift (the chaff of) grisin (beans split in a mill, one into two. For their improved appearance enables him to raise the price beyond the worth of the chaff removal.] These are the words of Abba Shaul. And the sages permit it. [For the buyer can evaluate the cost of chaff removal by comparing them with others. And it is worth his while to pay more for these sifted ones to spare himself the trouble (of sifting). The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] And they concur that he should not do so (only) on the surface of the container [to enhance their appearance, without having sifted the chaff below], for he is only an \"eye-stealer\" [with this surface sifting.] One may \"touch up\" neither a man [a Canaanite bondsman awaiting sale], a beast, nor vessels."

            "\tWhich (form of forbidden interest) is neshech and which is tarbith? Which is neshech? Lending a sela (four dinars) for five dinars; two sa'ah of wheat for three, (called \"neshech\") because he \"bites\" (noshech), [taking from him what he did not give him.] And which is tarbith? Increasing [profit to oneself] through produce. [And both in lending money and lending produce there is ribith (increase), for his money increases, but the latter part (of the Mishnah) treats of ribith by rabbinical ordinance, through buying and selling.] How so? If he bought wheat from him at a golden dinar [twenty-five silver dinars] to a kor (of wheat), and this was the market price [(And he is permitted to give him money now to receive from him wheat the entire year at that price according to the amount of money that he gave him even though right now he does not have wheat. As we learned (5:7): \"If the market price were announced, they may transact (on that basis). And even though he (the seller) may not have (the produce), another has,\" and the seller can buy it now at that price)] — If he said to him: \"Give me my wheat, for I wish to sell it and buy wine for it,\" and he (the seller) said to him: \"I accept your wheat at thirty dinars (to the kor), and I will give you wine for it\" — If he has no wine (this is ribith). [It is permitted if he (the seller) gave him wheat, but if he transacted to give him wine for it, and he has no wine, it is forbidden, lest the price of wine rise. And even if he transacts with him according to the current, announced market price, since he (the buyer) does not give him money, in which instance we could say that he (the seller) could buy wine (now) for the money he received; but he (the seller) came to take upon himself the price of wheat as a debt and to transfer it to the wine debt — if he has no wine, this is forbidden. For if he had wine, it would be immediately acquired by this one (the buyer), wine having been stipulated as payment for the debt, and if wine increased in price, it would have done so in his domain.]",
            "\tIf one gives a loan to his neighbor, he (the lender) may not live in his (the borrower's) courtyard free, and he (the borrower) may not rent it to him for less (than its price), this being ribith. It is permitted to add to rent [for granting time to pay], but it is not permitted to add to the sale price [for granting time to pay]. How so? If he rented him his courtyard and said to him: \"If you pay me now, you can have it for ten selaim a year; and if by month, it is a sela for a month,\" this is permitted. If he sold him his field and said to him: \"If you pay me now, you can have it for a thousand zuz; and if by harvest time, it is twelve maneh (twelve hundred zuz),\" this is forbidden. [The rationale: Rent is paid only at the end (of the month). Therefore, if he takes from him a sela a month, twelve selaim (a year), this is not payment for waiting, for he was not obliged to pay him rent until the end of the month. As to his telling him: \"If you pay me now, you can have it for ten selaim a year,\" if he does pay him early, this constitutes the renter's waiving part of the rent and reducing it. But with selling, as soon as he (the buyer) pulls the object, he is obliged to pay for it; so that when the seller says to him: \"If you pay me now, you can have it for a thousand zuz,\" this is its price, and if he adds to it for waiting until harvest time, this constitutes \"payment for waiting.\" (\"If he sold him his field\":) The same applies with movables and all wares. To sell something at more than its worth because of waiting time is forbidden and is avak ribith (\"the dust of ribith\") by rabbinic ordinance. In all instances of avak ribith, if the money is given, it cannot be recovered by the court, as opposed to ribith ketzutzah (\"determinate ribith\"), which is recovered by the court.]",
            "\tIf he sold him the field and he gave him part of the money, and he (the seller) said to him: \"When you wish, bring the (rest of the) money and take what is yours,\" this is forbidden. [As when the seller said to the buyer: \"When you bring the rest of the money, acquire it from now.\" It is forbidden to do this, for if the seller eats fruits (of the field) in the interim, when the other brings the money, the field is found to have been acquired by him from the day of the sale, and the seller (is found) to have eaten fruits as payment for waiting. And if the buyer eats fruits from now, perhaps he will not bring the rest of the money and the seller will return what he had received from him, so that the field will be found not to have been sold to him (the seller having said: \"When you bring the rest of the money, acquire it from now,\" and he did not bring it), and the first payment would be (found to have been) a loan in general to the buyer, and the seller would be found to have eaten fruits in payment (for having granted a loan)]. If he gave him a loan for his field, and he (the lender) said to him: \"If you do not repay me from now until three years, it is mine,\" it is his. [As when he (the borrower) said to him: \"Acquire it from now if I do not repay you from now until three years.,\" For this is not an asmachta (a mere \"understanding\"), but a bona fide kinyan (act of acquisition), the lender taking possession of it now for this money (that he gave the borrower), and it (the field) becomes cheaper in his (the lender's) possession. And the fruits are deposited with a third person. If the borrower repays the loan within three years, the fruits are given to him. And if not, they are given to the borrower, the field having been acquired by him from the time of the loan, and that loan having been payment for the field.] And Baitos b. Zonin did so (i.e., He borrowed upon his field) by the counsel of the sages.",
            "\tA shopkeeper is not set up (in a transaction) for half-profits, and one may not give (him) money to buy produce for half-profits unless he gives him (the shopkeeper) his wage as a worker. [One may not tell a shopkeeper: \"This produce is sold in the market four sa'ah for a sela, and you sell it retail in your shop and profit a sa'ah. Take this produce and sit and sell it in your shop, and we shall share the profits.\" The rationale: We rule that such a transaction is half loan-half deposit. One who accepts wares for half-profits presumably accepts responsibility for accident and depreciation of half the principal. Therefore, that half, since he is liable for accident, is a loan to him, being appraised for him at the market price and yielding him half profit. It is found, then, that the shopkeeper looks after the other's half, which is deposited with him in payment for a time grant in returning the loan, for which reason it is forbidden — unless he pays the shopkeeper for looking after that half as a worker idled from his regular work, i.e., if he were a carpenter or a smith — how much he would take to be freed from this heavy work to engage in light work.] Hens are not set for half (profits) [i.e., One may not assess the value of eggs and give them to the owner of a hen to set it upon them to hatch chicks for half of the profit (the cost differential of chicks to eggs). For since the hen owner accepts responsibility for half the worth of the eggs if they are spoiled or if they (the chicks) die, half of the transaction is a loan, so that the hen owner is found to be looking after the other half in payment for a time grant (in returning the loan)]. And calves and foals are not assessed at half [i.e., \"Now, they are worth this and this — Take it upon yourself to raise them for two years for half-profits, and for half-liability if they die\"], unless he pays him for his work and for his food expenditure [(In the former instance,) what he pays to feed the chicks]. But small calves and foals may be accepted for half-profit [without assessment, (with the understanding) that if they die, he pays nothing, and if they live, they are divided.], and they are raised until they are a third [of their (anticipated full) height, at which point they divide.] And an ass, until it can bear a load. [This was their practice in raising them before dividing them.]",
            "\tAssessments are made of cow and ass [(large ones that are fit for labor, all of the labor going to the receiver)], and of everything that they do and eat, for half-profits [to divide their appreciation in worth and in offspring.] Where the custom is to divide the offspring immediately [when the time arrives; for a small beast, thirty days, and for a large one, fifty], they divide; where the custom is to raise them, they do so. R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: A calf is assessed together with its mother, and a foal together with its mother [and it is not necessary to provide payment for work and food for the calf (see 4:4), but only for the mother. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon b. Gamliel.] And mafrin on one's field without fear of ribith (transgression). [(\"mafrin\":) as in parah veravah (being fruitful and multiplying). Some read it \"mafriz,\" as in (Zechariah 2:8): \"P'razoth will Jerusalem be inhabited\" — That is, he \"expands\" upon his field. As when the renter of the field says to the owner: \"You are wont to take ten kor a year for renting your field. Lend me two hundred zuz for fertilizer so that I can sow and plow the field, and I will give you twelve kor a year for rent, and I will return your money.\" This is permitted, these two korim being added because he receives a better field, whose rental is higher than that of an inferior field.]",
            "\tTzon-barzel is not accepted from a Jew, it being ribith. [Tzon-barzel is property for which the receiver assumes full responsibility. Its value is assessed for him, and so long as he does not return the money, they share the profits. And even though this is a superfluous Mishnah, it already having been taught (5:4): \"A shopkeeper is not set up for half-profits\" because he takes half-liability upon himself — how much more so here! Still, it is taught because of what follows, viz.:] But tzon-barzel is accepted from a gentile. And they (gentiles) are borrowed from and lent to on interest. The same applies to a ger-toshav (a gentile living in Eretz Yisrael who abides by the seven Noachide mitzvoth). A Jew may lend the money of a gentile by warrant of the gentile, but not by warrant of a Jew. [As when a Jew borrowed money from a gentile and wished to return it to him. If another Jew found him and said: \"Give it to me and I will raise it (the repayment) for you as you raise it for him\" — If he (the original borrower) placed him next to the gentile — even if the Jew (himself) gives it to him at the behest of the gentile, it is permitted. And if he did not place him next to the gentile, it is forbidden, for he (the Jew himself) would be lending him upon interest.]",

And even though he (the seller) may not have (the produce), another has, (and the seller can buy it now at that price). If he (the buyer) were the first to harvest [and he had a grain stack, and the market price had not yet been announced], he may transact with him [at whatever price he wishes] for the stack. [For since he has produce, there is no ribith here, the stack being acquired by him from now (i.e., the time of the transaction). And even though he did not pull it (to effect acquisition), since even if he did not have produce, it would be only avak ribith by rabbinic ordinance, when he does have it they did not decree (against it)] (He may transact with him) for the avit of grapes and for the ma'atan of olives. [An avit is  a large vessel where grapes are stored before being trodden, being warmed there for the better exuding of their wine. The (comparable) vessel for olives is called a \"ma'atan.\"], and for the \"eggs\" of the potter [If he had collected earth and shaped it into \"eggs\" for the making of pots, he may transact with him for the pots at whichever price he wishes, though the market price had not yet been announced], and [he may transact with him] for lime [at whichever price he wishes] once they [the wood and the stones] have been steeped in the kiln [to be burned into lime]. And he may transact with him for (fertilizer) foliage all the days of the year. R. Yossi says: Foliage may not be contracted for unless he had foliage in his refuse heap. The sages permit it. [The difference between the sages and the first tanna: The first tanna says: \"All the days of the year.\" R. Yossi differs, saying: Whether it be the rainy season or the dry season, the seller must have foliage in his heap. And the sages permit it only in the dry season. For even though he may have none, others do have, all having foliage (in the dry season), it already having turned to mould and chaff in the rainy season — but they do not permit it in the rainy season. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.] And he contracts with him according to the \"high\" market price [i.e., \"If the market price falls below the present one, give it to me at the cheaper price.\" (\"high\":) i.e., \"cheap.\" He gives him \"high,\" abundant produce at low cost.] R. Yehudah says: even if he did not contract with him according to the \"high\" market price, he may tell him: \"Give it to me at this (\"high\") price, or return my money.\" [For he did not pull (to effect acquisition), and he can back out. And even \"He who exacted payment, etc.\" does not obtain here. For he had not given his money to acquire the produce then (i.e., at the time he paid), but afterwards; and in the interim the market price had changed. It is assumed that one contracts for the lowest market price. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]",
            "\tA man may lend his tenant-farmers wheat-for-wheat for sowing, but not for eating. [It is permitted to lend sa'ah-for-sa'ah to a tenant-farmer only when he wishes to sow it. The rationale: In a place where it is the tenant-farmer who supplies the seed, if he has no seed for sowing the field, the owner will send him away. And if the tenant-farmer borrows from the owner and sows and returns (a sa'ah of) wheat to him when the price of wheat has risen, this is not (return on) a loan, but it is as if he (the tenant-farmer) goes down to (work) it now on the understanding that the owner takes from the seed first from the share that reverts to the tenant-farmer, and the tenant-farmer takes what is left as pay for his work, having contracted to work it on this understanding — that he take less than other tenant-farmers according to the amount of the seed, and there is no ribith here.] For R. Gamliel would lend his tenant-farmers wheat-for-wheat for sowing. Whether it (wheat) were dear (when he lent it) and it were cheap (when returned), or it were cheap (when lent) and dear (when returned), he would take from them according to the cheaper price. Not because this is the halachah, but because he wished to be strict with himself. [That is, it was necessary to adduce this Mishnah because R. Gamliel was stringent, taking (the wheat back) according to the cheaper price if the price fell. The Mishnah apprises us that this is not the halachah, but that R. Gamliel wished to be strict with himself.]",

And even if he has only one sa'ah, he may borrow several kor upon it. For with each one we say, this will be its replacement, it not being acquired by the lender, and the borrower being permitted to sell it or eat it. And when he borrows each one, he does so licitly.] And thus did Hillel say: A woman may not lend a loaf to her neighbor until she \"converts\" it to money, lest wheat become dearer and they come to ribith (transgression).

Gamliel says: There is antecedent ribith and supervening ribith. How so? If he thought to borrow from him and he sent him a gift, thinking: \"So that you lend me,\" this is antecedent ribith. If he borrowed from him and returned his money and sent him a gift, saying: \"For the money that was 'idle' with me,\" this is supervening ribith. R.

How can a hired watcher exempt himself with an oath that he was not derelict? Even without being derelict he is also liable. For this (the breaking of the jug) is not an (outright) accident, but comparable to theft and loss, which are close to dereliction and accident. What is more, if it broke in a place which was not on a slant, how could even an unpaid watcher swear that he was not derelict? He certainly was! And R. Meir holds that this oath is not prescribed by law, but is a rabbinic ordinance. For if one carrying a jug from place to place were not absolved of payment by such an oath, no one would carry a jug for his neighbor from place to place.

The second (Ibid. 9): \"If a man give to his neighbor an ass or an ox or a lamb,\" speaks of a hired watcher, who is liable for theft and loss, it being written in that regard (Ibid. 11): \"And if stolen it will be stolen from him, he shall pay to its owner.\" This tells me only of theft. Whence do I derive (liability for) loss? From: \"If stolen it will be stolen\" — in any event (i.e., any manner of loss. What is more, it follows a fortiori, viz.: Now, if he is liable for theft, which is close to being an accident, how much more so for loss, which is close to being dereliction!

[This Mishnah cannot be understood as it stands, for the ruling is that if one says: \"You owe me a manah and the other says: \"I do not know,\" he swears a consuetudinal oath (shvuath heseth) that he does not know, and he is not liable. Therefore, the Gemara construes the instance as one in which he says to him: \"I gave you two cows, one day to be borrowed; the other day, to be hired, and both died in the borrowing time\" — and the other says: \"One died in the borrowing time; the other, I do not know\" — he admits part (of the claim) and is liable for an oath (that he does not owe the other part), and since he cannot swear, (not knowing), he pays. This is comparable to one's saying: \"You owe me a hundred,\" and the other's saying: \"I know (that I owe you) fifty, and I do not know (if I owe you another) fifty,\" in which instance he is liable for an oath, and, not being able to swear, he pays.] If the hirer says: The hired one died; on the day it was hired for, it died; in the time (i.e., the part of the day) that it was hired for, it died — and the other says: I do not know, he is not liable.

[This, too, cannot be understood as it stands, for the ruling is that if one claims wheat and the other admits barley, he is not liable — even for barley. And here, too, what was admitted was not claimed, and what was claimed was not admitted. What place is there, then, for this oath! The Gemara, therefore, construes this as an instance of an oath through gilgul (\"rolling\"), the one saying to the other: \"Swear to me the oath of the watchers, for which you are liable, that it died a natural death,\" and since he takes this oath, he also takes the other, through gilgul, that the hired one died.] If one says I do not know, and the other says I do not know, they divide. [This Mishnah is in accordance with Somchos, who says: Money whose status (i.e., ownership) is in doubt is divided. This is not the halachah.

[ Some understand this \"messenger\" of the borrower to be his hired laborer or retainer, who lives in his house, but not that he made him a messenger in the presence of witnesses; for if he had done so, the borrower would be liable for accidents as soon as it (the cow) were given him. And others say that even if he made him a messenger in the presence of witnesses, he would not thereby become liable for accidents. For he would (only) be saying, in effect: \"He is a reliable person; if you wish to send it with him, send it.\"] If the borrower said to him: Send it to me with my son; with my bondsman; with my messenger — or: with your son; with your bondsman; with your messenger — Or if the lender said to him: I am sending it with my son; with my bondsman; with my messenger — or: with your son; with your bondsman; with your messenger — and the borrower said: \"Send,\" and he sent it and it died, he is liable. And the same applies when he returns it. [(\"with your bondsman\":) This \"bondsman\" is a Hebrew bondsman. For if it were a Canaanite bondsman, \"the hand of the bondsman is as the hand of his master,\" and it would be as if it had not left the domain of the master, as if the master himself were bringing it; and the borrower would not be liable if it met with an accident on the road. (\"And the same applies when he returns it\":) If the borrower sent it with his son, with his bondsman, or with his messenger — or with the son, the bondsman, or the messenger of the lender, it does not leave the domain of the borrower until it reaches the lender; and if it met with an accident on the road, he (the borrower) is liable. If the lender said to him: Send it to me, or if the borrower said: I am sending it, etc., and the lender said: \"Send,\" and he sent it, and it met with an accident on the road, he is not liable. In our Mishnah, it is only when he returns it within the borrowing period that he is liable for accidents; but if he returns it thereafter, his status is that of a paid watcher (having benefitted from it) and not that of a borrower.

And it is not known whether he gave the money before she gave birth and the child is his (the buyer's) or after she gave birth, and the child is the (original) owner's. But a cow is not acquired by money, but by pulling. So that if he pulled it, he would know whether it had or had not given birth.

R. Yehudah said: What kind of measurement is kri? [The kri measurement is not appropriate for both a large and a small field, for the cultivation of the one is not comparable to that of the other.] Rather, (the criterion is) if there is enough (to equal) the dropping (of seed).

If it were not \"a plague of the land,\" he does not deduct from his rental, [for he (the owner) says to him: \"It's your hard luck.\"] R.

He returns it, and keeps the other with him, viz.:] He returns the pillow at night and the plow in the daytime. And if he (the debtor) dies, he (the creditor) does not return (the pledge) to his heirs, [there being no mitzvah to return it, it being written (Ibid. 13): \"Return shall you return to him the pledge\" — to him, and not to his heirs.] R. Shimon b. Gamliel says: Even to him (the debtor) himself, he returns it only until thirty days [the time of beth-din], and from the thirtieth day on it is sold in beth-din.

Gamliel.] A pledge is not taken from a widow, whether she be poor or rich, it being written (Deuteronomy 24:17): \"And you shall not take as a pledge the garment of a widow.\" [Because there is one who holds that it is a poor widow from whom a pledge is not taken, for since you must return it to her, and she comes and goes with you, you give her a bad name with her neighbors — but with a rich one, to whom this does not apply, we might think that a pledge is taken; we must, therefore, be apprised to the contrary, viz.: \"You shall not take the pledge of a widow\" subsumes both a poor and a rich widow.] If one takes a mill as a pledge, he transgresses a negative commandment, and he is liable (individually) for two implements, viz. (Ibid. 6): \"One shall not take as a pledge the nether millstone nor the upper millstone.\" And it is not only nether and upper millstone that were interdicted, but all things which are used for food processing, viz.

[He builds the house and the lower ceiling and dwells in it until he recovers his expenses, and then he vacates it and builds his upper story.] R. Yehudah says: This one, too, lives in his neighbor's (dwelling), and he must pay him!
