            "The early commentaries ask why this chapter, which discusses details of the <i>halakhot</i> of found items, precedes the second chapter, which discusses the fundamental <i>halakhot</i> of found items.<br><i>Tosafot</i> explain that as tractate <i>Bava Metzia</i> follows tractate <i>Bava Kamma</i>, the <i>halakhot</i> of found items are elucidated in this chapter as a continuation of the topics discussed in the last chapter of <i>Bava Kamma</i>, which discussed the division of items between litigants by means of an oath, which is also the ruling in the mishna here (see <i>Shita Mekubbetzet</i>). The Rosh explains that because there is a suspicion of theft in this case, these matters are juxtaposed with the <i>halakhot</i> of theft, which are described at length in <i>Bava Kamma</i>.<br><br>If <b>two</b> people came to court <b>holding a garment,</b> and <b>this</b> one, the first litigant, <b>says: I found it, and that</b> one, the second litigant, <b>says: I found it; this</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and that</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine;</b> how does the court adjudicate this case? <b>This</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than half of it, and that</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than half of it, and they divide</b> it. If <b>this</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and that</b> one <b>says: Half of it is mine,</b> since they both agree that half of the cloak belongs to one of them, the conflict between them is only about the other half. Therefore, <b>the one who says: All of it is mine, takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than three parts,</b> i.e., three-fourths, <b>of it, and the one who says: Half of it is mine, takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than one-quarter of it. This</b> one <b>takes three parts, and that</b> one <b>takes one-quarter.</b>",
            "If <b>two</b> people <b>were sitting</b> in a riding position <b>on</b> the back of <b>an animal,</b> e.g., a donkey or camel, <b>or one was sitting</b> in a riding position on the animal <b>and one was leading</b> it by its halter, and <b>this</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and that</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine,</b> how does the court adjudicate this case? <b>This</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than half of it, and that</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> ownership of <b>less than half of it, and they divide</b> it. <b>When they admit</b> to the validity of each other’s claims <b>or when they</b> each <b>have witnesses</b> attesting to their claims, <b>they divide</b> the disputed item <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath,</b> as an oath is administered only in a case where the parties have no other way to prove their claims.",
            "If one <b>was riding on an animal and saw a found item, and said to another</b> person who was walking beside him: <b>Give</b> it <b>to me,</b> if the pedestrian <b>took it and said: I have acquired it</b> for myself, <b>he has acquired it</b> by means of lifting it, even though he did not see it first. But <b>if, after giving it to</b> the one riding the animal, <b>he said: I acquired it</b> for myself <b>at the outset, he has said nothing</b> and the rider keeps the item.",
            "If one <b>saw a found item and fell upon it,</b> intending to thereby acquire it, but did not employ one of the formal modes of acquisition, <b>and</b> then <b>another came and seized it, the one who seized it acquired it</b> because he employed one of the formal modes of acquisition. If one <b>saw</b> people <b>running after a found</b> ownerless animal, e.g., <b>after a deer</b> crippled by <b>a broken</b> leg, or <b>after young pigeons that</b> have <b>not</b> yet learned to <b>fly,</b> which can be caught easily, <b>and he said: My field has effected acquisition</b> of this animal <b>for me, it has effected acquisition</b> of it <b>for him.</b> If the <b>deer were running in its</b> usual <b>manner, or</b> the <b>young pigeons were flying, and he said: My field has effected acquisition</b> of this animal <b>for me, he has said nothing,</b> as one’s courtyard cannot effect acquisition of an item that does not remain there on its own.",
            "With regard to <b>the found item of</b> one’s <b>minor son or daughter,</b> i.e., an ownerless item that they found; <b>the found item of his Canaanite slave or maidservant;</b> and <b>the found item of his wife, they are his.</b> By contrast, with regard to <b>the found item of</b> one’s <b>adult son or daughter; the found item of his Hebrew slave or maidservant;</b> and <b>the found item of his</b> ex-<b>wife, whom he divorced, even if he has not</b> yet <b>given</b> her payment of the <b>marriage contract</b> that he owes her, <b>they are theirs.</b>",
            "With regard to one who <b>found promissory notes, if they include a property guarantee</b> for the loan <b>he may not return</b> them to the creditor, <b>as,</b> if he were to return them, <b>the court</b> would then <b>use them to collect repayment</b> of the debts from land that belonged to the debtor at the time of the loan, even if that land was subsequently sold to others. If <b>they do not include a property guarantee, he returns</b> them to the creditor, <b>as</b> in this case <b>the court</b> will <b>not use them to collect repayment</b> of the debt from purchasers of the debtor’s land. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case <b>he should not return</b> the promissory notes to the creditor, <b>as,</b> if he were to return them, <b>the court</b> would in any event <b>use them to collect repayment</b> of the loan from purchasers of the debtor’s land.",
            "If <b>one found bills of divorce, or</b> bills of <b>manumission of slaves,</b> or <b>wills,</b> or deeds of <b>a gift, or receipts, he may not return</b> these items to the one who is presumed to have lost them, <b>as I say</b> it is possible that <b>they were written and</b> then the writer <b>reconsidered about them</b> and decided <b>not to deliver them.</b>",
            "If one <b>found documents of appraisal</b> of a debtor’s property for the purpose of debt collection; <b>or documents concerning food,</b> which were drawn up when one accepted upon himself to provide sustenance for another; <b>documents of <i>ḥalitza</i>; or</b> documents of <b>refusal</b> of a girl upon reaching majority to remain married to the man to whom her mother or brothers married her as a minor after the death of her father; <b>or documents of <i>beirurin</i>,</b> a concept that will be explained in the Gemara; <b>or any court enactment,</b> e.g., a promissory note that has been authenticated by the court, in all of these cases, the finder <b>must return</b> the document to its presumed owner. If one <b>found</b> documents <b>in a <i>ḥafisa</i> or in a <i>deluskema</i>,</b> both of them types of containers, or if he found <b>a roll of documents or a bundle of documents, he must return</b> them. <b>And how many</b> documents are considered to be <b>a bundle of documents?</b> It is <b>three</b> that are <b>tied together. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If the documents make reference to loans of <b>one</b> person <b>who borrowed</b> money <b>from three</b> people, the finder <b>must return</b> them <b>to the debtor,</b> as they were presumably in his possession before being lost. If the documents make reference to loans of <b>three</b> people <b>who borrowed</b> money <b>from one</b> person, <b>he must return</b> them <b>to the creditor,</b> as they were presumably in his possession before being lost. If one <b>found a document among his documents</b> that were given to him by other people as a trustee, <b>and he does not know what its nature is,</b> i.e., he does not remember who gave it to him or whether the debt mentioned in it has been paid, the document <b>is placed</b> aside <b>until Elijah</b> the prophet <b>comes</b> and clarifies the issue through his prophecy. <b>If there are cancellations of contracts [<i>simponot</i>] among them, he should do what</b> is stated <b>in the <i>simponot</i>.</b>"

            "In a case where one discovers lost items, <b>which found items</b> belong <b>to him, and</b> for <b>which</b> items is <b>one obligated to proclaim</b> his find so that the owner of the lost items can come and reclaim them? <b>These found items</b> belong <b>to him:</b> If one <b>found scattered produce, scattered coins, bundles</b> of grain <b>in a public area, round cakes</b> of pressed <b>figs, baker’s loaves, strings of fish, cuts of meat,</b> unprocessed <b>wool fleeces that are taken from their state</b> of origin directly after shearing, bound <b>flax stalks, or</b> bound <b>strips of</b> combed <b>purple wool, these</b> belong <b>to him,</b> as they have no distinguishing marks that would enable their owners to claim them. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one finds <b>any</b> lost item <b>in which there is an alteration,</b> he is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find. <b>How so?</b> If he <b>found a round</b> cake of pressed figs with an <b>earthenware</b> shard <b>inside it</b> or <b>a loaf</b> of bread <b>with coins inside it,</b> he is obligated to proclaim his find, as perhaps the owner of the item inserted them as a distinguishing mark by means of which he could reclaim his property in case it became lost. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If one finds <b>any <i>anpurya</i> vessels,</b> since their shape is uniform and they are indistinguishable, he is <b>not obligated to proclaim</b> his find.",
            "<b>And</b> for <b>these</b> found items, one is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find: If <b>one found produce inside a vessel, or a vessel by itself; coins inside a pouch, or a pouch by itself; piles of produce; piles of coins,</b> <b>three coins</b> stacked <b>one atop another; bundles</b> of grain <b>in a secluded area; loaves of a homeowner,</b> as each shapes his loaves in his own unique manner; <b>wool fleeces that are taken from the house of a craftsman,</b> as each craftsman processes the wool in his own unique manner; <b>jugs of wine; or jugs of oil.</b> If one finds any of <b>these,</b> he is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find.",
            "If one <b>found, behind</b> a wooden <b>fence or behind</b> a stone <b>fence, bound fledglings, or</b> if he found them <b>in the paths that</b> run <b>through fields, he may not touch them,</b> as they were certainly placed there intentionally. In a case where <b>one found a vessel in a garbage dump, if</b> it is <b>concealed, he may not touch it,</b> as a person certainly concealed it there. <b>If</b> it is <b>exposed,</b> the finder <b>takes</b> the item <b>and proclaims</b> his find. If one <b>found</b> lost items <b>in a heap</b> of stone rubble <b>or in an old wall, these</b> belong <b>to him.</b> If <b>one found</b> lost items <b>in a new wall from its midpoint and outward,</b> they belong <b>to him.</b> If he found the items <b>from its midpoint and inward,</b> they belong <b>to the homeowner. If</b> the homeowner <b>would rent</b> the house <b>to others</b> on a regular basis and there was a steady turnover of residents, <b>even</b> if one found lost items <b>inside the house, these</b> belong <b>to him.</b> Since the owner of the lost items cannot be identified based on location, he will certainly despair of recovering his lost items.",
            "If one <b>found</b> items without a distinguishing mark <b>in a store, those</b> items belong <b>to him,</b> as, since the store is frequented by the multitudes, the owner despairs of its recovery. If the items were found <b>between the</b> storekeeper’s <b>counter and the storekeeper,</b> the items belong <b>to the storekeeper;</b> since his customers do not typically have access to that area, presumably the items are his. If one found coins <b>before a money changer, those</b> coins belong <b>to him.</b> If the coins were found <b>between the</b> money changer’s <b>chair and the money changer, those</b> coins belong <b>to the money changer,</b> because his clients do not typically have access to that area. In the case of <b>one who purchases produce from another or</b> in a case <b>where another sent him produce</b> as a gift, <b>and he found coins</b> intermingled <b>with</b> the produce, <b>those</b> coins belong to <b>him. If</b> the coins <b>were bundled,</b> this serves as a distinguishing mark and the finder <b>takes</b> the coins <b>and proclaims</b> his find.",
            "This mishna is an excerpt from a halakhic midrash concerning lost items, based on the verse: “You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep wandering, and disregard them; you shall return them to your brother…And so shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with his garment; and so shall you do with every lost item of your brother, which shall be lost from him, and you have found it; you may not disregard it” (Deuteronomy 22:1, 3). <b>The garment was also</b> included <b>in the generalization</b> that one must return <b>all of these</b> items. <b>And why did it emerge</b> from the generalization that is should be specified? <b>To draw an analogy to it and to say to you: What</b> is notable <b>about a garment?</b> It is notable <b>in that there are distinguishing marks concerning it and it has claimants</b> asserting ownership, and its finder is obligated to proclaim his find. <b>So too</b> with regard to <b>any item concerning which there are distinguishing marks and it has claimants</b> asserting ownership, its finder is <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find.",
            "<b>And until when</b> is one who finds a lost item <b>obligated to proclaim</b> his find? He is obligated to do so <b>until</b> the moment <b>that the neighbors will know of its</b> existence; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is obligated to proclaim his find for <b>three pilgrimage Festivals and</b> for <b>seven days after the last</b> of the three <b>pilgrimage Festivals, so that</b> its owner <b>will</b> have time to <b>go to his home,</b> a trip lasting up to <b>three</b> days, and ascertain that he in fact lost the item, <b>and</b> he <b>will return</b> to Jerusalem, a trip lasting up to <b>three</b> days, <b>and proclaim</b> his loss for <b>one day.</b>",
            "If a claimant accurately <b>stated</b> what type of item <b>the lost item</b> that was found by another is, <b>but did not state,</b> i.e., describe, <b>its distinguishing marks,</b> the finder <b>shall not give</b> it <b>to him. And</b> in the case of <b>a swindler, even though he stated its distinguishing marks,</b> the finder <b>shall not give</b> the lost item <b>to him, as it is stated:</b> “And if your brother be not near you, and you know him not, then you shall bring it into your house, and it shall be with you <b>until your brother claims [<i>derosh</i>] it [<i>oto</i>],</b> and you shall return it to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2). Would it enter your mind that the finder would give it to him before he claims it? How can the finder return it if he does not know the identity of the owner? Rather, the verb <i>derosh</i> is not referring to the claim of the owner; it is referring to the scrutiny performed by the finder. You shall not return the lost item <b>until</b> you <b>scrutinize [<i>shetidrosh</i>] your brother</b> to determine <b>whether</b> he, the claimant, <b>is a swindler</b> or <b>whether he is not a swindler.</b> If one finds <b>any</b> living <b>being that works and</b> generates enough revenue to cover the costs of the food that it <b>eats,</b> it <b>shall work and eat</b> while in the finder’s possession. <b>And any</b> living <b>being that does not work but</b> it does <b>eat shall be sold, as it is stated:</b> “Then you shall bring it into your house, and it shall be with you until your brother claims it, <b>and you shall return it to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:2), indicating that the finder must <b>see how</b> best <b>to return it to him.</b> Since the owner must repay the finder for his expenditures, if feeding the animal costs more than its value, the finder’s keep-ing the animal in his possession will prevent the owner from recovering it. <b>What shall be</b> done <b>with the money</b> received from the sale of the animal? <b>Rabbi Tarfon says:</b> The finder <b>may use it; therefore, if</b> the money <b>is lost,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it. Rabbi Akiva says: He may not use</b> the money; <b>therefore, if it is lost,</b> he is <b>not liable</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it.</b>",
            "If one <b>found scrolls, he reads them once in thirty days</b> in order to ventilate them and prevent mold. <b>And if he does not know</b> how <b>to read, he rolls</b> and unrolls <b>them</b> in order to ventilate them. <b>But he shall not study</b> passages <b>in them for the first time,</b> as he would leave the scroll exposed to the air for a lengthy period, thereby causing damage. <b>And another</b> person <b>shall not read</b> the scroll <b>with him,</b> as each might pull it closer to improve his vantage point, which could cause the scroll to tear. If one <b>found a garment, he shakes it once in thirty days, and he spreads it</b> out <b>for its sake,</b> to ventilate it, <b>but</b> he may <b>not</b> use it as a decoration <b>for his</b> own <b>prestige.</b> If one found <b>silver vessels or copper vessels,</b> he <b>may use them for their</b> own <b>sake</b> to prevent tarnish and rust, <b>but</b> he may <b>not</b> use them <b>to</b> the extent that he will <b>erode them.</b> If he finds <b>gold vessels or glass vessels,</b> which are not ruined by neglect, <b>he may not touch them until Elijah will come</b> and identify the owner. If a person <b>found a sack or a basket or any</b> other <b>item that</b> it <b>is not his</b> typical <b>manner to take</b> and carry because it is beneath his dignity, <b>he</b> shall <b>not take</b> it, as one need not demean himself in order to return a lost item.",
            "<b>Which is</b> the item that is considered <b>lost property?</b> If <b>one found a donkey or a cow grazing on the path, that is not lost property,</b> as presumably the owners are nearby and are aware of the animals’ whereabouts. If one found <b>a donkey with its accoutrements overturned, or a cow</b> that <b>ran through the vineyards, that is lost property.</b> In a case where <b>one returned</b> the lost animal <b>and it fled,</b> and he again <b>returned it and it fled, even</b> if this scenario repeats itself <b>four or five times,</b> he is <b>obligated to return it</b> each time, as it <b>is stated:</b> “You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep wandering and disregard them; <b>you shall return them</b> to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1). If in the course of tending to and returning the lost item, the finder <b>was idle from</b> labor that would have earned him <b>a <i>sela</i>, he shall not say to</b> the owner of the item: <b>Give me a <i>sela</i></b> to compensate me for my lost income. <b>Rather,</b> the owner <b>gives him his wage as</b> if he were <b>a laborer,</b> a payment that is considerably smaller. <b>If there are</b> three men <b>there</b> who can convene as <b>a court,</b> he <b>may stipulate before the court</b> that he will undertake to return the item provided that he receives full compensation for lost income. <b>If there is no court there before whom can he stipulate</b> his condition, <b>his</b> financial interests <b>take precedence</b> and he need not return the lost item.",
            "If <b>one found</b> an animal <b>in a stable</b> belonging to its owner, he is <b>not obligated</b> to return <b>it</b> to its owner. If he found it <b>in a public area,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to return <b>it. And if</b> the animal <b>was</b> lost <b>in a graveyard</b> and a priest found it, <b>he may not become impure to</b> return <b>it. If his father said to him: Become impure; or</b> in a case <b>where</b> one was obligated to return the animal and his father <b>said to him: Do not return</b> it, <b>he may not listen to</b> his father, as one may not violate Torah law to honor his father. If <b>one unloaded</b> a burden from an animal collapsing under its weight <b>and</b> then later <b>loaded</b> it onto the animal, and later <b>unloaded and loaded</b> it again, <b>even</b> if this scenario repeats itself <b>four or five times,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to continue unloading and loading, <b>as it is stated:</b> “If you see the donkey of him that hates you collapsed under its burden, you shall forgo passing him by; <b>you shall release it [<i>azov ta’azov</i>]</b> with him” (Exodus 23:5). It is derived from the verse that one is obligated to perform the action as needed, even several times. If the owner <b>went, and sat, and said</b> to a passerby: <b>Since</b> there is <b>a mitzva</b> incumbent <b>upon you</b> to unload the burden, <b>if it is your wish to unload</b> the burden, <b>unload</b> it, in such a case the passerby is <b>exempt, as it is stated:</b> “You shall release it <b>with him,”</b> with the owner of the animal. <b>If</b> the failure of the owner to participate in unloading the burden was due to the fact <b>he was old or infirm,</b> the passerby is <b>obligated</b> to unload the burden alone. There is <b>a mitzva by Torah law to unload</b> a burden, <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> mitzva <b>to load</b> it. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> There is <b>even</b> a mitzva <b>to load</b> the burden. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: If there was</b> a burden <b>upon</b> the animal <b>greater than</b> its typical <b>burden, one need not attend to it, as it is stated: “Under its burden,”</b> i.e., the obligation is with regard to <b>a burden that</b> the animal <b>can bear.</b>",
            "If one finds <b>his lost item and his father’s lost item,</b> tending to <b>his</b> own <b>lost item takes precedence.</b> Similarly, if one finds <b>his lost item and his teacher’s lost item,</b> tending to <b>his</b> own lost item <b>takes precedence.</b> If one finds <b>his father’s lost item and his teacher’s lost item,</b> tending to <b>his teacher’s</b> lost item <b>takes precedence, as his father brought him into this world, and his teacher, who taught him</b> the <b>wisdom</b> of Torah, <b>brings him to life in the World-to-Come. And if his father is</b> a Torah <b>scholar,</b> then <b>his father’s</b> lost item <b>takes precedence.</b> If <b>his father and his teacher were</b> each <b>carrying a burden</b> and he wants to assist them in putting down their burdens, he first <b>places his teacher’s</b> burden down <b>and thereafter places his father’s</b> burden down. If <b>his father and his teacher were in captivity,</b> he first <b>redeems his teacher and thereafter redeems his father. And if his father is</b> a Torah <b>scholar,</b> he first <b>redeems his father and thereafter redeems his teacher.</b>"

            "In the case of <b>one who deposits an animal or vessels with another,</b> who is acting as an unpaid bailee, <b>and they were stolen or they were lost,</b> and the bailee <b>paid</b> the owner the value of the deposit, <b>and did not wish to take an oath</b> that he did not misappropriate the item and that he was not negligent in safeguarding it, that will effect who keeps the deposit if it is found or returned. The bailee may also choose to take the oath, <b>as</b> the Sages <b>said: An unpaid bailee takes an oath, and he is</b> thereby <b>released</b> from the liability to pay the owner.

Therefore, the bailee is entitled to any payment the thief presents for the item, be it compensation for the item’s value or a fine.

A renter is exempt in a case of damage due to circumstances beyond his control, including death, but a borrower is liable to compensate the owner even for damage due to circumstances beyond his control. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: How does the other</b> party, i.e., the renter, <b>do business with</b> and profit from <b>another’s cow?

            "In the case of <b>one who deposits produce with another,</b> and the bailee provides him with different produce in return, <b>that</b> bailee <b>deducts</b> from the produce that he returns an amount equal to the standard <b>decrease</b> of the produce. The decrease is calculated according to this formula: <b>For wheat and for rice,</b> he deducts <b>nine half-<i>kav</i> per <i>kor</i>,</b> which is 180 <i>kav</i>; <b>for barley and millet,</b> he deducts <b>nine <i>kav</i> per <i>kor</i>; for spelt and flaxseed,</b> he deducts <b>three <i>se’a</i>,</b> which total eighteen <i>kav</i>, <b>per <i>kor</i>. The entire</b> calculation is <b>according to the measure, and the entire</b> calculation is <b>according to the time</b> elapsed.

            "There is a halakhic principle that when one purchases an item, the payment of the money does not effect the transaction. The transaction is effected only by means of the buyer’s physically taking the item into his possession, e.g., by pulling the item. Payment of money by the buyer creates only a moral obligation for the seller to sell him the item. When two types of currency are exchanged for each other, one of the types will have the status of the money being paid, and the other will have the status of the item being purchased. Handing over the former will not effect the transaction, while handing over the latter will. The mishna teaches: When one purchases gold coins, paying with silver coins, the gold coins assume the status of the purchased item and the silver coins assume the status of money. Therefore, when one party takes possession of <b>the gold</b> coins, the other party <b>acquires the silver</b> coins. <b>But</b> when one party takes possession of <b>the silver</b> coins, the other party <b>does not acquire the gold</b> coins. In an exchange of silver coins for copper coins, when one party takes possession of <b>the copper</b> coins, the other party <b>acquires the silver</b> coins. <b>But</b> when one party takes possession of <b>the silver</b> coins, the other party <b>does not acquire the copper</b> coins. In an exchange of flawed coins for unflawed coins, when one party takes possession of <b>the flawed coins,</b> the other party <b>acquires the unflawed</b> coins. <b>But</b> when one party takes possession of <b>the unflawed</b> coins, the other party <b>does not acquire the flawed</b> coins. In an exchange of an unminted coin for a minted coin, when one party takes possession of <b>an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>],</b> the other party <b>acquires</b> a minted <b>coin.</b> But when one party takes possession of a minted <b>coin,</b> the other party <b>does not acquire an unminted coin.</b> In an exchange of a coin for movable property, when one party takes possession of the <b>movable property</b> the other party <b>acquires the coin.</b> But when one party takes possession of the <b>coin,</b> the other party <b>does not acquire the movable property.</b> <b>This is the principle:</b> With regard to those who exchange <b>all</b> forms of <b>movable property, each acquires</b> the property of <b>the other,</b> i.e., the moment that one of the parties to the exchange takes possession of the item that he is acquiring, e.g., by means of pulling, the other party acquires the item from the first party.

            "<b>How</b> so?

By contrast, once the buyer paid for the item he cannot renege on his decision and demand return of his money, even if he did not yet take possession of the purchase item. ",

If the seller <b>was first among the reapers,</b> having harvested his crop before the market rate was set, he <b>may set</b> a price <b>with</b> a buyer as he wishes <b>for a stack</b> of grain that is already in his possession, <b>or for</b> a large <b>basket of grapes</b> prepared for pressing into wine, <b>or for a vat [<i>hama’atan</i>] of olives</b> prepared for pressing into oil, <b>or for the clumps [<i>habeitzim</i>]</b> of clay prepared for use <b>by a potter, or for plaster</b> nearing the end of the manufacturing process at the point <b>after he has sunk it,</b> i.e., baked it, <b>in the kiln.</b> Although the market rate has yet to be set, the seller may nevertheless set a price now for their eventual delivery. The mishna continues: <b>And he may set</b> a price <b>with</b> a buyer <b>for manure</b> on <b>any</b> of <b>the days of the year,</b> as the manure will certainly be available and it is therefore viewed as if it is ready. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One may set</b> the price <b>of manure only if he</b> already <b>had</b> a pile <b>of manure in</b> his <b>dunghill</b> to which the sale can immediately be applied, <b>but the Rabbis permit it</b> in all cases. <b>And one may</b> also <b>set</b> a price <b>with</b> a buyer <b>at the highest rate,</b> i.e., a large amount of produce sold for the lowest price, stipulating with the seller that the sale price match the lowest market rate for this product during the course of the year. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even if he did not set</b> a price <b>with him</b> beforehand <b>at the highest rate,</b> the buyer <b>may say</b> to the seller: <b>Give me</b> the produce <b>at this</b> rate <b>or give me</b> back <b>my money.</b> Since he did not formally acquire the produce, if the price changed he may withdraw from the transaction.
