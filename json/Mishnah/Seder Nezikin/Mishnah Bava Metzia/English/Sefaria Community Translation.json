He [the former] takes three quarters and he [the latter] takes one quarter.",

One says, \"all of it is mine,\" and the other one says, \"all of it is mine.\" This one shall swear that he owns no less than half of it, and the other one shall swear that he owns no less than half of it, and they will divide it.  In a situation where they agree, or they have witnesses, they divide it without an oath.",

However, if there is no mortgaged property mentioned, it may be returned, for the courts will not seize property from them - these are the words of Rabbi Meir.  The Sages say, in either case, it should not be returned, because the court may [nevertheless] seize property from them [because of the strength of the document].",

[However,] if one found them in a packet or a bag, wrapped together or as a bundle of documents, he should return [them]. And how is a bundle of documents [defined]? - three tied together.  Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says, if the document records a borrower from three lenders, it should be returned to the borrower; three borrowers from one lender, should be returned to the lender.  If one found a document in his files but doesn't know its history, it should be left until Eliyahu comes [and resolves it].

Rabbi Yehuda says, anything which has on it a change, one must announce. How so? If one found a cake with a clay shard in it, or a sheaf with money within it. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says, any merchandise, one does not need to announce.",

If one found a vessel in a trash-heap: if it was covered, one should not touch it, but if it was exposed, one should take and announce [it]. If one found [an object] in a stone-pile or in an old wall, these belong to him [the finder]. If one found [an object] in a new wall: from the middle [of the wall] to the outside, these belong to him [the finder], [but] from the middle [of the wall] to the inside, these belong to the owner of the house.

In front of the money-changer, these belong to him [the finder]. Between the seat and the money-changer, these belong to the money-changer. The one who buys fruits from another or who sent fruit to another, and within them found coins, these belong to him [the finder].

            "Even a garment is in the same general rule of all of these. Why [did the Torah] specify it? To compare to it, to say to you: just as a garment is special in that it has markings, and [if lost] there are claimants for it, so too anything which has markings and has claimants for it, one must announce [it].",
            "And until when must one announce [the object]? Until one's neighbors knew of it - these are the words of Rabbi Meir.  Rabbi Yehuda says, the three pilgrimage festivals, and after the last festival, seven days - in order that [someone] will go home - three, and will return - three, and will announce - one day.",

Anything which does work and eats, one may use it [to do work] and feed it. Something which does not work but does eat, [the finder] must sell it, as the Torah states, (Deuteronomy 22:2) \"You shall return it to him\": See how you shall return it to him.

Sometimes the intent is specifically Torah scrolls], one should read from them once every thirty days and if one does not know how to read, he should roll them.  However, one should not learn from them for the first time, nor may one read [from them] with someone else.  If one found clothing, one should shake it once every thirty days, and spread it out [according] to its need, but not to honor himself [by hanging it in his home]. Utensils of silver or bronze, one should use them [according] to their need, but not to wear them out. Utensils of gold or glass one should not touch them until Eliyahu comes. If one found a bag or a box, or anything which is undignified to pick up - one should not pick [it] up.",
            "What is a lost object? If one found a donkey or a cow grazing along the path, this is not a lost object; a donkey with its gear overturned, a cow running between vineyards, this is a lost object. If [the finder] returned the animal and it ran away, he returned it and it ran away, even four or five times, he is obligated to return it; as the Torah states, (Deuteronomy 22:1) \"You shall surely return them.\" If [the finder's] lost time is worth a sela, he should not say to him [the owner]: \"Give me a sela;\" but he should give him his wage like an idle laborer. If there is a court there, he may bring it before the court; if there is not a court there before which to bring it, his own [need] takes precedence.",

If it was in a cemetery, he may not impurify [himself] for it. If his father said to him 'impurify [yourself]', or 'do not return [a lost object]', he should not listen to him. If [a person] unloaded [an animal] and [the owner] reloaded [the animal], he unloaded and he reloaded, even four or five times, he is obligated [to unload]; as the Torah states, (Exodus 23:5): \"You shall surely relieve.\" If [the owner] went and sat down, and said to the passer-by: 'Since the mitsvah is upon you, if it is your will to unload [the animal], do so,' [the latter] is exempt; as the Torah states, (Exodus 23:5) \"With him.\" If he is old or sick, he is obligated. It is a mitsvah from the Torah to unload [an animal], but not to reload [it]. Rabbi Shimon says: \"Even to reload.\"  Rabbi Yosei the Galilean says: \"If [the weight] was more than it was able to carry, it is not necessary for him, as the Torah states, (Exodus 23:5): \"Under its burden\": a burden that it is able to withstand.",
            "If his lost object and his father's lost object [are to be attended to], his lost object takes precedence; his own lost object and his teacher's lost object, his own takes precedence; his father's lost object and his teacher's lost object, his teacher's takes precedence, because his father brought him into this world, but his teacher, who taught him wisdom, brings him to live [in] the world to come; if his father is a sage, [the object] of his father takes precedence. If his father and his teacher were carrying a burden, he should relieve his teacher, and afterward relieve his father. If his father and his teacher were in prison, he should redeem his teacher and afterward he should redeem his father; if his father was a sage, he should redeem his father and afterward he should redeem his teacher."

[If the thief] butchered or sold the object, he must pay four or fivefold. To whom does he pay? To him who [kept] the deposit with him. [If the guardian] swore the [prescribed oath] and did not want to pay, and [afterward] the thief is found, he must pay double.

Everything is according to the measure, [and] everything is according to the [length] of time. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri said: What do the mice care? Don't they eat [the same amount] whether from a lot or a little? Rather, he may only deduct a decrease of only one <i>kor</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says: If there was a large quantity, he may not deduct decreases, because [some] is left behind.",

If it was purified oil [stored], one cannot deduct [any] yeast; if the vessels were old, he cannot deduct [for] absorption. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even if the one who sells purified oil to his neighbor all the days of the year. [The purchaser] accepts a [loss of] <i>log</i> and one-half of yeast from one hundred [<i>logim</i> of oil.]",

If it was broken [while] it was in his hand [and it was] for his own need, he is liable; but [if it was] for the need of [the cask], he is exempt. If it broke, from when he placed it, either for his own need or for its need, he is exempt. [If] the owners assigned a place [for it] and he moved it and it broke, whether [it was] in his hand or from when he placed it, [if the move] was for his own need, he is liable, if it was for its need, he is exempt.",

Rabbi Akiva says: [He must pay the value from] the time it was demanded. The one who considers misusing the deposit, the Beit Shamai says: He is liable; and the Beit Hillel says: He is not liable until he misuses it; as the Torah states, (Exodus 22:10): \"that he has not stretched forth his hand against the property belonging to his neighbor\"; How? If he bent down the cask, and took a quarter [of a <i>log</i>] from it, and it was broken, he must pay only for the quarter; if he lifted up the cask and took a quarter from it, and it was broken, he must pay the entire value [of the cask]."

Up to the time it takes to show it to a merchant or to one's relative. Rabbi Tarfon taught in Lod: Fraud is eight silver per <i> sela</i>, [which is] one-third of the sale price, and the merchants of Lod were happy.

Yeast of one wine may not be mixed with that of another, but [the seller] may give the yeast [along with the wine].

He shall not say to [his fellow], “Plow with me in the dry season and I will plow with you in the rainy season.” Rabban Gamaliel says: There is advance interest and subsequent interest. How so? If he set his sights on borrowing from another and sent him [a gift] and says, “This is in order that you will lend to me,” this is advance interest. If one borrowed from another and repaid it to him, and then sent him [a gift] and said, “This is for your money that was value-less [while] it was with me,” this is subsequent interest.
