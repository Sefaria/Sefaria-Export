            "A worker hired by the day can collect [the worker’s wages] all of the [following] night. A worker hired by the night can collect it all of the [following] day. A worker hired by the hour can collect it all day and night. A worker hired by the week, month, year, or period of seven years, if his time expires by day, can collect [his wages] all of [that] day; [If the worker’s time] expires by night, he can collect it all [that] night and the [following] day.",
            "Whether it be the hire of person, the hire of a beast, or the hire of utensils, it is subject to [the commandment], “In the same day you shall give him his hire” [Deuteronomy 24:15], and it is subject to [the commandment], “The wages of a hired servant shall not stay with you all night until the morning.” [Leviticus 19:13.] When is that? When [the worker] claimed [the wages]; [But if] he did not claim [the wages], [the employer] does not violate [the commandment]. If [the employer] gave [the worker] a draft on a shopkeeper or a moneychanger, [the employer] does not violate [the commandment].  A hired worker, within the set time, swears [that he has not yet been paid] and is paid. But if the set time passed, [the worker] cannot swear and receive payment; Yet if there are witnesses that [the worker] claimed payment [within the set time], [the worker] can [still] swear and receive [payment].  A resident alien is subject to [the commandment], “In the same day you shall give him his hire,” But not to [the commandment], “The wages of a hired servant shall not stay with you all night until the morning.”"
