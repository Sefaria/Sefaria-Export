            "The Rabbis taught in the language (style) of the Mishnah: Rabbi Meir says: Anyone who involves himself in Torah for its own sake merits many things, and moreover the entire world is worthwhile for his sake;  He is called \"friend,\" \"beloved,\" \"lover of the Omnipresent,\" \"lover of [all] creatures,\" \"delighter of the Omnipresent,\" \"delighter of [all] creatures.\"  He is clothed in humility and reverence, and it prepares him to be righteous, devout, upright and trustworthy, and it distances him from sin, and draws him near to merit.  We enjoy from him counsel and comprehension, understanding and strength, as it is said (Proverbs 8:14): \"Mine is counsel and comprehension, I am understanding, mine is strength.\"  It gives him kingship and dominion, and [the ability to] investigate in judgement, and the secrets of the Torah are revealed to him, and he becomes like an ever-strengthening spring, and like a river that does not stop.  He is modest and long-tempered, and forgives insult to him;  And it enlarges him and raises him above all [that God] made.",
            "Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:  Each and every day a heavenly echo goes out from Mount Horeb, and announces and says: \"Woe to the creatures for disparaging the Torah;\"  for anyone who does not involve himself in the Torah is called \"rebuked,\" as it is said (Proverbs 11:22): \"A ring of gold in a swine's snout is a beautiful woman who turns from discretion,\" and it says (Exodus 32:16): \"And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tablets,\" do not read \"graven\" (<i>harut</i>) but rather \"freedom\" (<i>herut</i>), for there is no free man except one that involves himself in Torah learning;  And anyone who involves himself in Torah learning is elevated, as it is said (Numbers 21:19): \"and from Mattanah (a place name that means 'gift,' and so can refer to the gifting of the Torah), Nachaliel; and from Nachaliel, Bamot (a place name that means 'high places').\"",
            "One who learns from his fellow one chapter or one law or one verse or one utterance or even one letter must treat him with honor, and we found it to be thus with David, King of Israel, who learned only two things from Achithophel, [yet] called him his teacher, his guide, and his intimate, as it is said (Psalms 55:14) \"But it was you, a man my equal, my guide, and my intimate.\" And is it not a fortiori argument? If David, King of Israel, who only learned two things from Achithophel called him his teacher, his guide, and his intimate, how much more must one who learns one chapter or one law or one verse or one utterance or one letter from his fellow treat him with honor. And there is no honor except Torah, as it is said (Proverbs 3: 35) \"The wise shall inherit honor,\" and \"the whole-hearted shall inherit good\" (Proverbs 28: 10), and there is no good except Torah as it is said (Proverbs 4:2) \"I give you a good doctrine, do not forsake my Torah\".",

            "Greater is Torah than priesthood and kingship, for kingship is obtained with thirty levels, and priesthood with twenty-four, and Torah is obtained with forty-eight things.

            "Great is Torah, for it gives life to those who do it in this world and in the next world, as it says: \"For they are life to those that find them, and healing to all his flesh\" (Proverbs 4:22); and it says, \"It will be healing for your navel, and tonic to your bones\" (Proverbs 3:8). And it says, \"It is a tree of life to those who hold it, and those who grasp it are happy\" (Proverbs 3:18). And it says, \"For they are an accompaniment of grace for your head, and a necklace for your  throat\" (Proverbs 1:9). And it says, \"She will give your head an accompaniment of grace; with a crown of glory she will protect you\" (Proverbs 4:9). And it says, \"For by me your days will be multiplied, and you will be given additional years of life\" (Proverbs 9:11). And it says, \"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left is wealth and honor\" (Proverbs 3:16); and it says, \"For length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you\" (Proverbs 3:2); and it says, \"her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace\" (Proverbs 3: 17).",
            "Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, says: beauty, strength, riches, honor, wisdom, maturity, hoary head, and children are fitting for the righteous and fitting for the world, as it is written: \"The hoary head is a crown of glory, it will be found in the way of righteousness\" (Proverbs 16:31). And it says (Proverbs 20:29), \"The glory of young men is their strength; and the beauty of old men is the hoary head.\" And it says (Proverbs 14:24), \"The crown of the wise is their wealth.\" And it says (Proverbs 17:6), \"Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.\" And it says (Isaiah 24:23), \"Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the Lord of hosts will reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be honor.\" Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: These seven qualities enumerated by the sages about the righteous were all fulfilled in Rebbi (Yehuda haNasi) and his sons.

            "Five possessions has the Holy One, Blessed be He, declared His own in His world, And these are them: The Torah [is] one possession, Heaven and earth [are] one possession, Abraham [is] one possession, Israel [is] one possession, [and] the Sanctuary [is] one possession.  From where [do we infer that] the Torah [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, the first of His of old” (Proverbs 8:22).  From where [do we infer that] heaven and earth [are] one possession? For it is written: “Thus says the Lord: ‘The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. Which house might you build for Me? And which place might be My resting-place?’” (Isaiah 66:1). And it [also] says: “How manifold are Your works, O Lord! In wisdom have You made them all; full is the earth with Your possessions” (Psalms 104:24).  From where [do we infer that] Abraham [is] one possession? For it is written: “And [Melchizedek] blessed him, and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth’” (Genesis 14:19).  From where [do we infer that] Israel [is] one possession? For it is written: “Till Your people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over whom You have made Your own” (Exodus 15:16). And it [also] says: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all My delight” (Psalms 16:3).  From where [do we infer that] the Sanctuary [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Sanctuary, O Lord, that Your hands have established” (Exodus 15:17). And it is [also] said: “And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had possessed” (Psalms 78:54).",
            "Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in this world, He created only for His honor, as it says (Isaiah 43:7): \"Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My honor, I have formed him, yes, I have made him.\" And it also says (Exodus 15:18 ), \"The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.\"<br><br>(Makkot 3:16) Rabbi  Chananya ben Akashia says, The Holy One, Blessed be He, wanted to give Israel merit; therefore He multiplied for them Torah and commandments, as it said, \"The Lord desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and glorious,\" (Isaiah 42:21)."
