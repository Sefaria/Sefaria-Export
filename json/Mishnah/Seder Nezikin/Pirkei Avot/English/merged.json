And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one, for you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments. Also, weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it. And [weigh] the gain [that may be obtained through the committing] of a transgression against the loss [that may be sustained] by [committing] it.  Keep your eye on three things, and you will not come to sin: Know what is above you: An Eye that sees, and an Ear that hears, and all your deeds are written in a book.",

And all [study of the] Torah in the absence of a worldly occupation comes to nothing in the end and leads to sin.  And all who work for the community, let them work for the [sake of the] name of Heaven; for the merit of their ancestors sustains them, And their righteousness (<i>tsidkatam</i>) will endure forever. And as for you [who work for the community], [God says:] I credit you with a great reward, as if you [yourselves] had done it [on your own].",

Nullify your will to His will, so that He will nullify the will of others to your will. Hillel says: Do not separate yourself from the congregation. Do not believe in yourself until the day of your death. Do not judge your fellow until you come to his place. Do not say something that cannot be heard, for in the end it will be heard. Do not say, \"When I will be available I will study [Torah],\" lest you never become available. ",

Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai had five students: Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananya, Rabbi Yosi the Priest, Rabbi Shimon ben Netanel, and Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh. He would recount their praises: Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos is a pit covered in plaster that does not lose a drop. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananya--happy is the one who gave birth to him! Rabbi Yosi the Priest is pious. Rabbi Shimon ben Netanel fears sin. And Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh is an ever-strengthening fountain.

He said to them: I see the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh [as better than] all of yours, because your words are included in his. He said to them: Go out and see what is an evil path that a person should distance himself from. Rabbi Eliezer says: A bad eye. Rabbi Yehoshua says: A bad friend. Rabbi Yosi says: A bad neighbor.

Borrowing from a person is like borrowing from the Omnipresent blessed be He, as it says (Psalm 37, 21) \"The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous one gives graciously.\" Rabbi Elazar says: A bad heart.

From where [is there proof that] even [when there is only] one [person studying Torah], The Holy One, Blessed be He, determines a reward for him?

Or, he is liable for his soul because that learning was his protection, and now that he has forgotten it, he is no longer protected], it being written (Deuteronomy 4:9): \"Only take heed to yourself and heed your soul exceedingly, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw.\" I might think this were so even if his learning \"overcame\" him [i.e., even if it was difficult for him and because of its difficulty he forgot it]; it is, therefore, written (Ibid.): \"and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life\" — He is not liable for his soul unless he sits and (deliberately) removes them from his heart.",

[When one begins (a regimen of) separation and he fears lest he transgress, he takes it upon himself as a vow that he will not do such and such and thereby suppresses his inclination.] A fence for wisdom is silence. [What are we speaking of? If silence from words of Torah, it is written (Joshua 1:8): \"And you shall meditate (lit., \"speak\") in it day and night, etc.\" If silence from talebearing, slander, and cursing — this is (interdicted) by the Torah! We must be speaking then of silence from permitted speech between a man and his neighbor — that one should minimize such speech as far as possible.

            "\tR. Yossi b. Kisma said: \"Once I was walking along the road when a certain man met me and greeted me and I greeted him in return. He asked me: 'Rebbi, where are you from?' I answered: 'From a great city of sages and scribes.' He replied: \"Rebbi, please live with us in our place and I will give you thousands upon thousands of golden dinars and precious stones and pearls.' I said to him: 'My son, if you gave me all the silver and gold and precious stones and pearls in the world I would live only in a place of Torah. For when a man dies there accompany him neither silver nor gold nor precious stones nor pearls, but Torah and good deeds alone.'\" As it is written (Proverbs 6:22): \"In your going forth, it will lead you, in your lying down, it will guard you, and in your waking, it will be your converse.\" \"In your going forth, it will lead you\" — in this world; \"in your lying down it will guard you\" — in the grave; \"in your waking, it will be your converse\" — in the world to come. And thus is it written in the book of Psalms of David, king of Israel (Psalms 119:72): \"Better to me the Torah of Your mouth than thousands in gold and silver,\" and (Chaggai 2:8): \"Mine is the silver and Mine the gold, says the L rd of hosts.\"", 
            "Five possessions has the Holy One, Blessed be He, declared His own in His world, And they are: The Torah [is] one possession, Heaven and earth [are] one possession, Abraham [is] one possession, Israel [is] one possession, [And] the Sanctuary [is] one possession.  From where [do we infer that] the Torah [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, the first of His of old.” (Proverbs 8:22.)  From where [do we infer that] heaven and earth [are] one possession? For it is written: “Thus says the Lord: ‘The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. Which house might you build for Me? And which place might be My resting-place?’” (Isaiah 66:1), And it [also] says: “How manifold are Your works, O Lord! In wisdom have You made them all; full is the earth, Your possession.” (Psalm 104:24.)  From where [do we infer that] Abraham [is] one possession? For it is written: “And [Melchizedek] blessed him, and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth.’” (Genesis 14:19.)  From where [do we infer that] Israel [is] one possession? For it is written: “Till Your people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over whom You have made Your own” (Exodus 15:16), And it [also] says: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all My delight.” (Psalm 16:3.)  From where [do we infer that] the Sanctuary [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Sanctuary, O Lord, that Your hands have established” (Exodus 15:17), And it is [also] said: “And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had possessed.” (Psalm 78:54.)", 
            "\tEverything that the Holy one Blessed be He created in this world, He created only for His honor, as it is written (Isaiah 43:7): \"All that is called by My name and which I have created for My honor — I have formed it; I have also fashioned it.\" And (Exodus 15:18): \"The L rd will reign for ever and ever.\"", 
            "(Makkot 3:16) Rabbi  Chananya ben Akashia says, The Holy One, Blessed be He, wanted to give Israel merit; therefore He multiplied for them Torah and commandments, as it is written, \"The Lord desired, for the sake of his righteousness, to make the Torah great and glorious,\" (Isaiah 42:21)."
