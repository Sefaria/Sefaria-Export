            "\tMoses received Torah from Sinai. [I say that because this tractate is not founded on any explanation of a mitzvah of the mitzvoth of the Torah as are the other tractates of the Mishnah, but is entirely mussar and middoth, and the sages of the gentiles have also written books from the musings of their heart on the ways of mussar — how a man should deport himself with his neighbor — therefore, the tanna begins this tractate: \"Moses received Torah from Sinai,\" to teach us that the middoth and mussar in this tractate were not conjured up by the sages of the Mishnah, but these, too, were stated on Sinai, (i.e., by Him who revealed Himself on Sinai)]. And He gave it to Joshua; and Joshua, to the elders, [who lived on after Joshua, until the advent of the first prophets, Eli the high-priest and Shmuel Haramati]; and the elders, to the prophets; and the prophets gave it to the men of the great assembly (anshei knesseth hagedolah). [They were 120 elders: Zerubaval, Seraya, Re'elayah, Mordecai-Bilshan, who lived in the days of Ezra, when they went up from the exile to the second Temple, among them, Chaggai, Zechariah, Malachi, and Nechemiah ben Chachalyah and their colleagues. They were called \"the men of the great assembly\" for having restored the \"Crown\" to its pristine (greatness). For Moses said (Deuteronomy 10:17): \"The great, mighty, awesome, G-d.\" Jeremiah and Daniel came and (Daniel) did not say \"great,\" and (Jeremiah) did not say \"awesome,\" and they (the men of the great assembly) restored them (\"great  and awesome\") as at first,\" saying \"this (as stated there [Yoma 69b]) is precisely His greatness\"; \"this is precisely His awesomeness\"; \"for if not so (i.e., if He were not great and awesome), how could one nation endure against seventy nations (intent upon annihilating it, etc.)!\"] They were wont to say three things. [They said many things; but they were wont to say these three things to uphold the integrity of Torah]: Be patient (\"metunim\") in judgment [i.e., if something comes before you for judgment, do not say: \"Such a case has come before me two or three times before,\" but be patient; that is, \"wait\" ('mamtinim') before you rule upon it.] And set up many disciples, [(as opposed to the view of R. Gamliel, who says (Berachoth 28a): \"Let no disciple whose inside is not like his outside enter the house of study.\") We are hereby taught that Torah is taught to every man, and there is no need to \"search him out,\" so long as he is not known to be a man of ill conduct and of ill repute. Or, we are (hereby) being taught that if one set up disciples in his youth, he should continue doing so in his old age, as it is written (Koheleth 11:6): \"In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening let your hand not rest.\"] And make a fence for the Torah, [so that you not come to violate the issur of the Torah itself (e.g., the secondary class [shniyoth] of forbidden relations) and shvuth (rabbinically interdicted occupation) on Sabbath, as it is written (Leviticus 18:30): \"And you shall keep My charge\" — Make a \"keeping\" for My charge.]",
            "\tShimon Hatzaddik was the last of the men of the great assembly [and the tradition (hakabalah) remained in his hand. He was high-priest after Ezra.] He was wont to say [(And thus all \"R. Ploni says\" and \"He was wont to say\" in this tractate are understood as \"This is what he would say always.\")]: The world stands on three things [i.e., the world was created for these three things alone]: on Torah [(Shabbath 88a) If Israel had not accepted the Torah, heaven and earth would not have been created, as it is written (Jeremiah 33:25): \"If not for My covenant (of Torah), day and night, the statutes of heaven and earth I would not have made\"], on avodah [the sacrificial service. For thus did we learn in tractate Ta'anith (27b): If not for the ma'amadoth (the \"watches\" at the sacrificial services), heaven and earth could not endure. And we find that because of the sacrifices offered up by Noach, He swore that He would never again bring a flood over the world — whence we see that the world endures because of the sacrifices], and on lovingkindness, [as it is written (Psalms 89:3): \"The world is built on lovingkindness.\" Lovingkindness consists of: rejoicing the groom, consoling mourners, visiting the sick, attending upon the dead, and the like.]",
            "\tAntignos Ish Socho received it from Shimon Hatzaddik: He was wont to say: Do not be like servants who serve their master in order to receive pras [\"valuation,\" as in the targum of (Leviticus 5:15): \"your valuation\" — \"bepursaneh,\" what one gives one who serves him, though he is not required by law to give him anything, as what one gives his young son or his wife or his servant because of the pleasure that he gives him. One should not serve his Creator even in the expectation of such pras], but be like servants who serve their master not in order to receive pras, [but out of love alone]. And let the fear of the L rd be upon you. [Even though you serve Him out of love, serve Him also out of fear. For one who serves out of love is zealous in the performance of positive commandments, while one who serves out of fear is heedful in the observance of negative commandments, so that his service is found to be complete. And thus did our sages say: \"Serve out of love and serve out of fear. Serve out of love, so that if you are moved to hate, know that you love, and a lover does not hate. Serve out of fear, so that if you are moved to \"kick,\" know that you fear, and a fearer does not kick.\"]",
            "\tYossi ben Yoezer Ish Tzreidah [the Nassi] and Yossi ben Yochanan Ish Yerushalayim [the av beth-din] received it from them. [All the tannaim mentioned in this chapter by pairs — \"This and this tanna received it from these and these\" — the first is the Nassi and the second, the av beth-din.] Yossi ben Yoezer says Let your house be a house of gathering for the sages. [When the sages wish to convene somewhere, let your house be the designated place, that they be accustomed to say: Let us meet in this and this one's house. For it is impossible that you not learn of them (thereby) some article of wisdom. To what may this be compared? To one's entering a spice shop. Even if he takes nothing, he absorbs the aroma and it leaves with him], and be dusted by the dust of their feet. [That is, follow them. For a walker raises dust with his feet, and one who walks after him is dusted by this dust. Alternately, sit at their feet on the ground. For that was the practice. The teacher would sit on a bench and the disciples would sit at his feet on the ground], and drink their words with thirst, [as a thirsty man, who drinks to quench his thirst, and not as a sated man, who despises his food, even what is tasty and good.]",
            "Yossi ben Yochanan Ish Yerushalayim says: Let your house be open wide, [like the house of our father Abraham, may peace be upon him, which was open on all four sides, so that guests would not have to make a circuit to find the door], and let the poor [of Israel] be the dwellers of your house, [— that one not hire (gentile) servants to serve him. Better that Jews benefit from his possessions and not the seed of the accursed Canaan.], and do not overindulge in speech with the woman. [From \"the woman\" as opposed to \"a woman\" we derive that they said this] of one's own wife; how much more so (does this apply) with the wife of one's neighbor! [Others explain that this applies to his wife in a state of niddah, so that he not come to the sin itself; but the language of the Mishnah seems to imply that even his wife in a non-niddah state is intended. And thus have the sages (Chagigah 5b) said (Amos 4:13): \"And He tells a man what his converse is\" — Even superfluous converse between a man and his wife is recounted to a man at the time of judgment (and he is held accountable for it — unless he must predispose her to the act of mitzvah [i.e., cohabitation], as in the instance of Rav, who would converse and \"play\" (with her) and then live with her] — whence the sages derived: When a man engages in superfluous converse with his wife, he brings evil upon himself. [Rabbeinu Hakadosh, who codified the Mishnah, wrote: From the words of this sage, who said: \"And do not overindulge in speech with the woman,\" the sages taught that whenever a man engages in superfluous converse with his wife he brings evil upon himself. (I found it written that when a man relates to his wife: \"This and this is what happened to me with that man,\" she teaches him to stir up strife, as in the instance of Korach, who related to his wife that Moses had \"lifted up the Levites\" — her reply incited him to strife.) Or, when he tells her that his friends demeaned and humiliated him, she, too, scorns him in her heart, and he thereby brings evil upon himself], and, [by preoccupying himself with idle talk,] he neglects Torah study, and, in the end, inherits Gehinnom.]",
            "\tYehoshuah ben Prachya and Nitai Ha'arbeli received it from them. Yehoshua ben Prachya says: Make a teacher for yourself. [Rambam explains: Even if he is not fit to be your teacher, still make him your teacher, and do not learn by yourself. And I have heard: \"Make a teacher for yourself\" that you learn from constantly, and do not learn today from one and tomorrow from another. And even though they said (Avodah Zarah 19a): \"If one learns Torah from only one master, he never sees a sign of blessing,\" they have already explained: That is true of svara (sharpening in dialectics after the \"substance\" has been acquired), it being beneficial for one to hear the svara of the many; but in gemara (acquiring the \"substance\" itself), one master is preferable, to avoid differences in formulations of the same (oral learnings)], and acquire a friend for yourself, [even if it is very costly for you to do so, and you must spend much to acquire his love. But it cannot be stated \"Acquire a teacher for yourself,\" a teacher being obliged to teach gratis], and judge each man in the scales of merit. [This is so when the act is in the balance, it not being discernible from his deeds whether he is righteous or wicked and he performs a deed which permits of judging him in the scales of merit or in those of guilt; it is the way of lovingkindness to judge him in the scales of merit. But if one is confirmed in evil, it is permitted to judge him in the scales of guilt, their having stated only (Shabbath 97a): \"If one suspects the innocent he is smitten in his body,\" implying that if he suspects the wicked he is not smitten.]",
            "\tNittai Ha'arbeli says: Distance yourself from an evil neighbor, [so that you not learn from his deeds, and, also, so that you not share in his downfall, for \"Woe to the wicked and woe to his neighbor!\"], and do not befriend the wicked one. [For thus did the sages say: All who attach themselves to the wicked, even though they do not emulate them, receive recompense as they do. To what may this be compared? To one's entering a spice shop. Even if he takes nothing, he absorbs the aroma and it leaves with him], and do not \"despair\" of [the arrival of] punishment [i.e., do not say: \"I shall cleave to this wicked one, whose deeds are prospering, for fortune is favoring him.\" He, therefore, says: \"Do not despair of punishment.\" That is, know that punishment will quickly come upon him, his undoing overtaking him of a sudden.]",
            "\tYehudah ben Tabbai and Shimon ben Shetach received it from them. Yehudah ben Tabbai says: Do not you, [(a judge)], make yourself like [those] orchei hadayanim [(lawyers), who arrange (\"orchim\") cases for the litigants before the judges, it being forbidden for one (a judge) to reveal his judgments to one of the litigants, telling him: Do thus and thus so that you win your case — even if he knows that he is in the right. Alternately, \"ke'orchei hadayanin,\" like the great among the judges. This, in reference to a disciple sitting before his master, that he not make himself like the great among the judges, to speak before his master as a decisor of the law. \"Orchei\" as in \"the erkaoth of the gentiles,\" the erkaoth of the House of David.\" And from others I have heard: \"Do not make yourself as the great ones of the judges to force the litigants to come to judgment before you.] And when litigants stand before you, let them be in your eyes like wicked ones, [that you not favor one of them, saying \"This one is a distinguished man and will not make a false claim.\" For if you say this, you will see no guilt in him.], and when they take their leave of you, let them be innocent in your eyes when they have taken the judgment upon themselves. [Do not suspect the arraigned one as a thief but as one who erred and had no intention of stealing. Or, if an oath was imposed upon one of them and he swore, do not say that he swore falsely.]",
            "\tShimon ben Shetach says: Be thorough in cross-examining the witnesses, and be circumspect in your words, lest from them they learn to lie. [Let the judge not say: \"Perhaps this and this is what happened,\" or \"If this were the case, Ploni would be innocent.\" From such words, the litigant or the witnesses learn to say what never happened.]",
            "\tShmayah and Avtalyon received it from them. [Shmayah and Avtalyon were righteous converts, of the descendants of Sancheriv. I heard it said that because Avtalyon was the av beth-din he was called by this name, which means \"a father to the young ones,\" \"talya\" in Aramaic meaning \"young,\" as in (Megillah 5b): R. Yochanan said: \"When I was young (talya),\" (Yevamoth 114a): \"Let the young boy (talya) and the young girl (talyata) come.\" Here, too, \"Avtalyon,\" the father of young orphans.] Shmayah says: Love labor. [Even if one has enough for his livelihood, he should work, for \"idleness leads to lassitude\" (Kethuvoth 59b).], and hate high station. [Do not say I am a man of eminence and work is demeaning to me, viz. (Pesachim 113a): Rav said to R. Kahana: \"Flay a carcass in the marketplace and take pay (for it), and do not say: 'I am a distinguished personage and it is beneath me.'\" Alternately: \"And hate authority.\" Do not lord it over the people, for \"lordship buries its practitioners.\"], and do not ingratiate yourself with the authorities (rashut) [in order to assume authority thereby. Or: Do not do so, so that they not turn you from your faith, as happened with Doeg the Edomite. (The authorities are called \"rashut\" (lit., \"permit\"), for they are \"permitted\" to do as they will.)]",
            "\tAvtalyon says: Sages, take heed of your words [that leave an opening for heretics to stray through them], lest you incur the punishment of exile and you be exiled to a place of \"evil waters\" and the disciples that come after you drink them and die and the Name of Heaven be profaned. [That is, even though in the place in which you find yourselves there are no heretics, it is to be feared that you may incur the punishment of exile because of a sin of yours and you be exiled to a place where there are people who interpret the Torah at variance with the halachah (this being the \"place of evil waters\") and they will understand from your words improper things, and the disciples who come after you will \"drink\" from those things and die in their sin and the Name of Heaven will be profaned. For those vain ideas will remain in the world. As happened in the instance of Antignos Ish Socho and his disciples, Tzaddok and Baythus, whom he told (viz. 1:3): \"Do not be like servants who serve their master in order to receive pras\" and who said: \"Is it conceivable for a worker to labor and exert himself a whole day and not receive a wage at night!\" They subsequently succumbed to heresy (and their disciples are called \"Tzdokkim\" and \"Baythusim\" to this day.)]",
            "\tHillel and Shammai received it from them. Hillel says: Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving men and drawing them close to Torah. [They explained in Avoth d' R. Nathan how Aaron loved peace. When he saw two men quarreling, he would go to each one without the knowledge of the other and say to him: \"Look at your friend. See how he regrets what he has done and how he smites himself for having sinned against you. He asked me to come to you and beg you to forgive him.\" Afterwards, when they met, they would kiss each other. And how would he draw men close to Torah? When he knew a man to have transgressed, he would befriend him and look kindly upon him — whereupon the other would think, in shame: \"If that tzaddik knew of my evil deeds, how he would distance himself from me!\" As a result, he would repent. This is the testimony of the prophet (Malachi 2:6): \"In peace and justness did he (Aaron) walk with Me, and many did he turn from sin.\"]",
            "\tHe (Hillel) was wont to say: One who projects (\"negad\") his name loses his name. [One who \"stretches out\" his name (afar) in lordship and authority will soon lose his name, for \"lordship buries its practitioners.\" (The targum of \"mishchu\" is \"negidu.\")], and he who does not add [to his learning], there will end (yasif) [from his mouth what he has already learned and he will forget his learning. Others read it \"ye'asef (i.e., \"he will be gathered in\" to his people and he will die before his time.], and he who does not learn [(ab initio, which is more severe than not adding to one's learning,)] incurs the penalty of death. [That is, he deserves to be killed (viz. Pesachim 49b): \"It is permitted to rip an ignoramus open, like a fish — and from his back,\" (such \"ripping\" being mortal)], and one who \"uses\" (i.e., exploits) the \"crown\" (taga) [of Torah (as one who \"uses\" his dishes)] passes away [from the world. There are some who explain \"taga\" as \"talmid\" (disciple); \"gavra\" (a man); \"achrina\" (another) — i.e., it is forbidden for a man to employ for his benefit disciples who are not his own. And I have heard: \"And one who uses taga (the ineffable Name) passes away and is lost (from the world), not having a share in the world to come.]",
            "\tHe was wont to say: If I do not [acquire merit] for myself, who [will acquire it] for me? And [even] if I do [acquire it] for myself, what [is it, relative to what] I am [obliged to acquire (i.e., relative to my potential)?] And if not now [i.e., in this world], then when? [For after I die, I can no longer acquire merit. Alternately: If not now (in my youth), then when? (Perhaps, in my old age, I will no longer be able to acquire it)].",
            "\tBeth Shammai say: Make your Torah primary [i.e., let your principal endeavor, day and night, be in Torah. And when you tire from learning engage in some occupation; and do not make your occupation primary and your learning secondary. [I have found it written: \"Make your Torah consistent. Do not be stringent (in ruling) for yourself and lenient for others, or stringent for others and lenient for yourself. But make your Torah consistent — for yourself as for others. And thus is it written in Ezra (7:10): 'For Ezra set his heart to expound the Torah of the L rd and to do and to teach the children of Israel' — just as he set his heart to do, so did he teach the children of Israel (to do).], say little and do much, [as we find with our father Abraham, of blessed memory, who first said (Genesis 18:5): \"I will take a loaf of bread,\" and then (Ibid. 7): \"And he took a calf, tender and good.\"], and receive all men with a kindly countenance. [When you invite guests to your house, do not receive them with your face \"sunk in the ground,\" for if one does so, even if he bestowed upon them all the gifts in the world, it is accounted to him as if he gave them nothing. Shammai adduces three exhortations relating (respectively) to the three eminences mentioned by Jeremiah (9:22): wisdom, strength and wealth. Relative to wisdom he says: \"Make your wisdom primary\"; relative to wealth, \"Say little and do much\"; and relative to strength, \"Receive all men with a kindly countenance. That is, one should suppress his inclination not to give and wage war with his recalcitrant heart. And we learned: \"Who is strong? One who suppresses his (evil) inclination.]",
            "\tR. Gamliel was wont to say [in respect to hora'ah (halachic rulings): If a question comes before you and you are in doubt (as to the halachah),] make a rav for yourself, and remove doubt from yourself [(and do not rule alone) as in the instance of Rava (viz. Horiyoth 3b). When a question of treifah (ritually unfit meat) came before him, he would gather together all the butchers of Mata Mechasia, saying \"so that each take a chip of the beam\" (i.e., so that the entire onus not fall on him alone)]. And do not tithe overmuch by estimate. [For one who does so is not spared defect. If he tithes too little, his tithes are correct, but his fruits are \"defective\"; and if he tithes too much, his fruits are \"corrected,\" but his tithes are defective.]",
            "\tShimon, his son, says: All my days I have grown up among the wise, and I have found nothing better for (my) body than silence [i.e., hearing myself shamed and remaining silent.] And it is not the expounding which is primary but the act [i.e., and know that silence is good, for even for expounding and speaking in Torah, than which there is nothing greater, the primary reward is for the act (which follows from it); and if one expounds and does not act (upon what he says), it would be better if he remained silent and did not expound.] And all who increase words bring sin. [For thus do we find with Eve, who \"increased words\" in saying (Genesis 3:3): \"G-d said: 'You shall not eat of it and you shall not touch it.'\" She added \"touching,\" which had not been forbidden to her, and the serpent pushed her until she touched it. And he said to her: \"Just as there is no death in touching it, so there is no death in eating it.\" And this led to her sin of eating from the fruit. As Solomon says (Proverbs 20:6): \"Do not add to His words, lest He reprove you and you be proven false.\"]",
            "\tR. Shimon b. Gamliel says: On three things the world subsists [(This is not like \"the world stands on three things\" (viz. 1:2)]: on justice [to exonerate the innocent and incriminate the guilty], and on truth, [that one not cheat his friend], and on peace, as it is written (Zechariah 8:16): \"(With) truth and justice and peace shall you judge in your gates.\"]"
        ],
        [
            "\tRabbi says: Which is the just path that a man should choose for himself? All that is gratifying to its doer and that earns him the praise of man. [And this will obtain when he walks in all the middoth (character traits) in the middle path and does not incline to one of the two extremes. For if he is extremely stingy, this is gratifying to him, for he thereby amasses great wealth, but men do not praise him for this. And if he is vainly extravagant, the men who receive from him praise him, but this (extravagance) is not gratifying to its doer, for he thereby reduces himself to poverty. But the middah of generosity, which is the mean between stinginess and extravagance, is gratifying to its doer, for he thereby preserves his wealth and is not overly extravagant, and this earns him the praise of men for living as he should. The same is true of all of the middoth]. And take heed of a \"light\" mitzvah as of a \"heavy\" one, for you do not know the reward of mitzvoth. [The Torah does not specify the reward of one who fulfills a positive commandment nor the punishment of one who fails to fulfill it. For the punishments of the negative commandments are specific: stoning, burning, the sword, strangulation, cutting-off, death at the hands of Heaven, stripes — the light punishment for the \"light\" transgression, and the heavy punishment for the \"heavy\" one], and weigh the \"loss\" of (performing) a mitzvah [i.e., what you lose of your wares or your money by engaging in a mitzvah] against its reward [in this world or the next, which will exceed that loss], and the \"reward\" of a transgression [i.e., what you gain from it] against its loss [i.e., what you are destined to lose by it.], and contemplate these things and you will not come to transgression: Know what is above you — a seeing eye and a hearing ear and all of your deeds are recorded in a book.",
            "\tR. Gamliel, the son of R. Yehudah Hanassi says: Torah study is \"becoming\" with derech eretz [labor or business], for the toil of both causes sin to be forgotten. [For the Torah attenuates a man's strength and labor breaks the body, and, as a result, the evil inclination departs from him. And if you would ask: If so, let him toil in Torah always and its toil would banish sin. Why, then, is labor needed? It, therefore, must be stated:] And all Torah without labor is lost in the end and foments sin. [For one cannot live without a livelihood and his end will be to rob men, and his learning will be forgotten.] And all who toil with the congregation, let them toil with them for the sake of Heaven. For the merit of their [the congregation's] fathers and their righteousness (which) stands forever, [and not the exertions of the toilers] will help them, [the toilers, to bring their righteousness to light.] And you, [the toilers], I will bestow great reward upon you, as if you had done it. [Even though this good was effected not through your deeds, but through the merit of the fathers of the congregation, I will bestow reward upon you as if you had wrought this great salvation in Israel, since you toil for the sake of Heaven. Alternately: all who toil with the congregation to compel them to (the performance of) a mitzvah — to charity or the redemption of captives — let them do so for the sake of Heaven. For the merit of the fathers of the congregation will help them give what they (the toilers) impose upon them — even great wealth. And the charity that they (the congregation) do will stand for them forever. And you who compel the congregation towards this mitzvah — I shall bestow reward upon you as if you had performed the mitzvah with your very wealth. And Rambam explains: \"And I will bestow upon you reward as if you had done them\" — If in your toil with the congregation, you have omitted the performance of a certain mitzvah, I will bestow reward upon you as if you had performed that mitzvah.]",
            "\t[You, who toil with the congregation, even though you must ingratiate yourself with the authorities in order to see to the needs of the congregation,] take heed of the authorities, for they draw one near only for their own ends. They appear to be lovers when things are going well for them, but they do not stand by a man in the time of his distress.",
            "\tHe was wont to say: Make His will like your will [i.e., Spread your wealth for the \"desires\" of Heaven as if they were your will, as if you spread it for your desires], so that He make your will like His will [i.e., so that He grant you good with an open hand.] Void your will before His will so that He void the will of others before your will [i.e., so that He void the will of all who rise against you for evil. And I have heard that this is a euphemism for \"so that He void His will for your will.\" [As stated (Shabbath 63a): \"If one performs a mitzvah as ordained, even a seventy-year decree is voided for him.\"] Hillel says: Do not separate from the congregation, [but share in their sorrow, for all who separate from the congregation do not merit seeing the consolation of the congregation (Ta'anith 11a)], and do not trust in yourself until the day of your death. [For Yochanan Cohein Gadol served as high-priest for eighty years, and, in the end, became a Sadducee (Berachoth 29a)], and do not judge your friend until you arrive at his place [i.e., if you see your friend being tested and failing, do not judge him guilty until you are put to the same test and succeed.], and do not say a thing which cannot be heard, which can be heard in the end [i.e., let your words not be ambiguous ones, which cannot be understood in the beginning, at first hearing, assuming that if the hearer analyzes them, in the end he will understand them. For this will lead people to mistake your words and possibly to come to heresy because of you. Alternately: Do not reveal your secret, even between you and yourself, saying that there is no one here to hear you, for in the end it will be heard, \"for a bird of heaven will carry the voice, etc.\" (Koheleth 10:20). According to this interpretation, the reading is \"for in the end it will be heard.\" But Rashi reads it \"And do not say of a thing [words of Torah] which can be heard (now) that it can be heard in the end,\" but incline your ear like a hopper and hear it now.], and do not say: When I can free myself [of my affairs] I shall learn (Torah); perhaps you will not free yourself.",

[One who eats and drinks overmuch until he becomes fat and fleshy increases worms for himself in the grave, and \"worms are as painful to the dead as a needle in the flesh of the living.\" This tanna comes to apprise us that all indulgences are detrimental to a man except indulgence in Torah, in wisdom, and in charity.] He who increases possessions increases worry, [lest they rob him or lest highwaymen fall upon him and kill him. (A certain chasid would pray: \"May He preserve me from 'scattering my soul.'\" When he was asked: \"What is 'scattering of soul'?\" He answered: \"Having many possessions scattered in many places and having to 'scatter' one's soul to think in this direction and that.\"] He who increases wives increases witchcraft. He who increases maidservants increases lewdness. He who increases manservants increases theft. [The rationale for the sequence is as follows: First a man primps himself and eats and drinks and increases flesh. Then he seeks to increase possessions, and after he does so, he sees that he has enough to feed many wives. After he increases wives, each one needs a maidservant, which he supplies. Since he has many household members, he requires fields and vineyards to supply them with wine and food, and he increases servants to work the fields and the vineyards — thus the sequence.] He who increases Torah increases life, [as it is written (Deuteronomy 30:20): \"For it is your life and the length of your days.\"] He who increases sitting (and learning) increases wisdom. [Many disciples gather and come to hear his conjectures. Some understand it as: He who increases disciples increases wisdom, for they sharpen him and add to his wisdom.] He who increases (the taking of) counsel increases understanding [one thing from another through the counsels of his advisers]. He who increases charity increases peace, [as it is written (Isaiah 32:17): \"And the act of charity will be (i.e., will lead to) peace.\"] He who acquires a good name acquires it for himself.

Yehoshua ben Chananiah, R. Yossi Hakohen, R. Shimon ben Nethanel, and R. Elazar ben Arach. He was wont to cite their (respective) distinctions: R. Eliezer ben Hurkanos — a lime-coated pit, that does not lose a drop. [So, he too does not lose one item of his learning]. R. Yehoshua — [He was so replete in good middoth that all said about him: \"Happy is she who bore him!\" (Others say: They said this because it was she who caused him to be a sage. She would make the rounds of all the houses of study in her city and say to them (the disciples): \"Please, pray for this fetus in my stomach, that he be a sage!\" And from the day that he was born, she did not remove his crib from the house of study, so that only words of Torah enter his ears.] R. Yossi — chasid, [acting above and beyond the letter of the law.] R. Shimon ben Nethanel — a fearer of sin, [stringent with himself and forbidding to himself permitted things out of fear that he might come to sin. For if not so, what is special about this? Even an ignoramus can be a fearer of sin.] R. Elazar ben Arach — a resurgent well, [of broad heart, \"welling up\" dialectic and conjecture of his own.] He (R. Yochanan ben Zakkai) was wont to say: If all the sages of Israel were in one balance of the scale and Eliezer ben Hurkanos in the other, he would outweigh them all. Abba Shaul says in his (R. Yochanan b. Zakkai's) name: If all the sages of Israel were in one balance of the scale and R. Eliezer ben Hurkanos also with them, and R. Elazar (ben Arach) in the other, he would outweigh them all. [I have found it written that Abba Shaul does not disagree with the first tanna and that both things were said by R. Yochanan ben Zakkai and both are true. In comprehensive knowledge and memory, R. Eliezer (ben Hurkanos) outweighed them all, and in sharpness and dialectic R. Elazar ben Arach outweighed them all.]",

Yehoshua says: A good friend, [who reproves him if he sees him doing something improper.] R. Yossi says: A good neighbor, [who is there for him both day and night (whereas a good friend is not there for him at all times.)] R. Shimon says: One who foresees what is to come, and, in consequence, weighs the loss of a mitzvah against its reward and the reward of a transgression against its loss (see 2:1)]. R. Elazar says: A good heart. [For the heart activates all of the other faculties and is the source of all deeds. And even though there are distinct limbs for (distinct) activities, it is the heart which is the \"awakener\" of all. Therefore,] R. Yochanan ben Zakkai said to them: I see the words of R. Elazar ben Arach [to be more cogent than yours], for your words are included in his. He said to them: Go and see which is the wicked way which a man should distance himself from. [He was constrained to ask this and did not understand from their words (above) that the wicked way is the opposite of the good way because the opposite of the good is not necessarily evil. For (for example), the trait of chasiduth (saintliness), doing what is above and beyond the letter of the law, is good; but one who is not a chasid and bases his conduct on the law of the Torah, is not wicked. And it may be said that though satisfaction (with what one has), \"a good eye,\" is a good thing, a desire for superfluities is not \"the wicked way,\" for he hurts no one thereby, and the same for all the middoth. He must, therefore, ask them: \"Which is the wicked way which a man must distance himself from?\"] R. Eliezer says: A wicked eye. R. Yehoshua says: A bad friend. R. Yossi says: A bad neighbor. R. Shimon says: One who borrows and does not repay. [This is the opposite of foreseeing what is to come. For if he does not repay, he will find no one to lend him and he will languish in hunger. He does not simply say: \"One who does not foresee what is to come, for it is possible for such a man not to come to harm by rescuing himself when the contingency arrives)]. Borrowing from a man is like borrowing from the L rd, as it is written (Psalms 37:21): \"The wicked one borrows and does not repay, and the Tzaddik is gracious and gives.\" [The Holy One Blessed be He, who is the tzaddik of the world, is gracious and gives to the lender what this one borrowed from him and did not repay — whence it emerges that the borrower remains indebted to the L rd.] R.

[One who is profuse in good deeds is given a profusion of mercy, and to one who is sparse in good deeds, the Holy One is sparse in mercy. Alternately, \"And all is according to abundance of deed\": A man is judged according to the majority of his deeds. If the majority are merits, he is innocent; if the majority are sins, he is guilty. Rambam explains: \"All is seen\": All the deeds of a man, both what he has done and what he is destined to do — all is revealed before Him.

(Do not say this, for) permission is given him to do either good or evil and he is under no compulsion whatsoever. And, this being so, he is judged by the Good One of the world, to exact (punishment) of the wicked and to grant reward to the righteous. For the sinner, who sinned by his will, deserves to be punished; and the righteous one, who was righteous by his will, deserves to be rewarded. \"And all is according to the abundance of deed\": In accordance with one's increasing and persisting in the doing of good will be the abundance of his reward. For there is no comparison between one who distributes a hundred gold pieces to charity at a hundred different times, to one who gives them (all) at one time.

[i.e., Who is worthy of glorying in his wisdom?] One who learns from all men, [even from those lesser than he. For since he is not jealous of his honor and learns from the lesser, it is seen that his wisdom is for the sake of Heaven and not for personal glory], as it is written (Psalms 119:99): \"From all of my teachers I grew wise,\" [followed by \"for Your testimonies were conversation to me.\" i.e., I learned Torah from all of my teachers, even those lesser than I, not being solicitous of my honor. For Your testimonies were conversation to me, all of my intent being for the sake of Heaven. Likewise,] Who is strong, [and worthy of glorying in his strength]? One who subdues his (evil) inclination, as it is written (Proverbs 16:32): \"Greater is he who withholds his wrath than the hero, and the ruler of his spirit, than the conqueror of a city.\" [(What precedes is a superficial rendering.) It is to be understood thus: Great is the withholding of wrath that comes from the strength of subduing the (evil) inclination (and not from the weakness of one's nature). And, similarly, [great is] ruling one's spirit when it comes from the conqueror of a city, i.e., from a king, who after conquering a city has the rebels brought before him and \"rules his spirit\" and does not kill them.] Who is rich, [and worthy of glorying in his riches]? One who rejoices in his lot, as it is written (Psalms 18:2): \"When you eat the toil of your hands, you are fortunate and it is well with you\" — You are fortunate in this world and it is well for you in the world to come. Who is honored? One who honors others. [Because if one merits the three good things mentioned above (wisdom, strength, and riches), he is honored in himself in the eyes of G-d and man, even if men do not (manifestly) honor him because of them — the tanna, therefore, adds: If one possesses these three middoth and is honored in himself, what should he do to be (manifestly) honored by others? Let him honor them!] As it is written (I Samuel 2:30): \"For I shall honor those who honor Me, and those who scorn Me shall be cursed.\" [The rest follows a fortiori, viz.: If the Holy One Blessed be He, the King of honor, who created everything in this world for His honor, honors those who honor Him — how much more so (should) flesh and blood (do so)! \"And those who scorn me shall be cursed\" — whence we derive the humility of the Holy One Blessed be He. He did not say \"I shall curse My scorners,\" but they shall be cursed\" — of themselves. And He is more solicitous of the honor of tzaddikim than of His own! viz. (Genesis 12:3): \"And those who curse you (Abraham), I shall curse.\"]",

And, what is more,] the reward for a mitzvah is a mitzvah, and the \"reward\" for a sin is a sin. [For Heaven assists, and places in the hand of one who has done a mitzvah the wherewithal to do another, in order to reward him for both; and thus with the \"reward\" for a sin. Or: All that one earns or enjoys in the doing of a mitzvah is reckoned to him as a mitzvah itself, and he receives reward both for the mitzvah and for the pleasure and the benefit that he derived therefrom; and the \"reward\" and the enjoyment that one derives from sinning is reckoned to him as a sin itself, and he is smitten both for the sin and for the reward and the pleasure that he derived from it.]",

And, what is more, most men go astray in it, so that people are not disposed to separate from it, wherefore it requires especial distancing.] R.

[There are some who explain \"If one learns in order to teach,\" in order to be called \"Rabbi,\" and who read \"it is not given him to learn and to teach,\" but in most books I have found it as in the first version, which is the correct one.] Do not make them (words of Torah) a crown to aggrandize yourself with. [Do not say: I will learn in order to be called \"Rabbi\" and to sit at the head, but learn from love, and honor is bound to come], (and do not make them) a spade with which to dig. [Do not learn Torah in order to make a livelihood of it. For one who does so profanes the holiness of Torah and is liable to death at the hands of Heaven, as is one who derives (personal) gain from sacred property. And the teachers of schoolchildren take pay only for watching them alone, that they not damage things, and for teaching them cantillations, which a teacher is not obligated to exert himself to do. But it is forbidden to take pay for teaching Torah, as it is written (Deuteronomy 4:14): \"And the L rd commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments\" (Ibid. 5): \"as the L rd my G-d commanded me\" — Just as I, gratis, you, too, gratis. And a judge, too, is forbidden to take a fee for ruling, but only an \"absentee fee,\" that it be manifest that the fee represents what he loses by absenting himself from his work to hear the pleas of the litigants (provided that he takes an equal amount from both. If he takes more from one than from the other, his rulings are nullified.) As to the Torah permitting a Torah scholar to benefit from words of Torah, this applies to selling his works in the marketplace before others do and also to his exemption from all (personal) taxes, impositions, and property taxes. The congregation must pay even the head tax for him. And even if he is wealthy and has much money he may claim exemption by law. And if a Torah scholar is sick and steeped in affliction and the congregation proffer large gifts to him in honor of his Torah, it is a mitzvah for him to take them. And this is not in the category of profiting from words of Torah since it is impossible for him to sustain himself otherwise. And, likewise, a Torah scholar who was appointed a parnas (community leader) or rosh haseder by the congregation, and who occupies himself with the needs of the congregation, may take a wage from them, even what is far in excess of what he needs for a livelihood, so that he be great, and feared and awe-inspiring to them, as we said with the high-priest of whom it is written (Leviticus 21:10): \"who is greater than his brothers,\" which the sages expound: \"Make him great from his brothers.\" His brother Cohanim are to make him wealthy from what is theirs. As to the early sages, who abstained from this, this was out of their chasiduth but it is not the din.] And this is what Hillel was wont to say: \"One who 'uses' the crown (of Torah) passes away\" — whereby we are taught that one who exploits words of Torah \"takes his life\" from the world.",

Or perhaps the tanna calls a false oath a vain oath, as when he (the defendant) [vainly] swore that he did not borrow, when he really did.] And one who is \"haughty\" in judgment, [judging without adequate review or deliberation] is a fool, an evildoer, and a man of arrogance.",

And do not say [to your colleagues, who dissent with your judgments] \"Accept my opinion,\" [for I am an expert, and without you I could have judged alone,] for they are permitted (to assert their opinions) and not you, [for since you had them join you, it is proper that the majority view prevail.]",

[For all three require a good name. For if he is a Torah scholar, but of ill repute, it is permitted to shame him; and if he is a high-priest, it is stated (Yoma 71b): \"Let the sons of the nations (i.e., converts) go in peace, who follow the practice of Aaron (who pursued peace), but let the sons of Aaron not go in peace, who do not follow the practice of Aaron\"; and if he is a king, it is written (Exodus 22:27): \"And a prince in your people you shall not curse\" — when he does the deeds of your people.]",

(Exodus 14:29): \"And the children of Israel walked on the dry land in the midst of the sea\"; four — the sea floor that the Egyptians pursuing Israel trod upon dampened into clay and tar, viz.

(Psalms 74:13): \"You crumbled the sea with Your strength\" — the sea became pieces; six — the solidified water hardened and became as hard as rocks, viz. (Ibid.): \"You broke the head of sea-serpents (the Egyptians) against the waters\"; seven — the sea broke into twelve pieces, so that each tribe cross on its own path, viz. (Ibid. 136:13): \"To Him who cut the sea into pieces\"; eight — the sea froze into sapphire, onyx, and glass so that the tribes could see each other, the pillar of fire lighting them, viz.

[For if a psul were found before the (prescribed time of) their mitzvah, it was not possible to offer others in their stead. For the omer was harvested at night, and they did not harvest much; and the two loaves were baked on the eve of yom tov, and their baking does not override yom tov. And, similarly, the show-bread was baked on the eve of Sabbath]; they stood in constriction (tzfufuim) [as in \"tzaf (floating) on the face of the waters.\" There were so many of them that they were pressed against each other to the point that their feet left the ground and they \"floated\" in the air] and they bowed in expansion. [When they bowed a miracle was performed for them and they bowed in (ample) room, each one four ells removed from his neighbor, so that one not hear the other when he confessed his sins]; and a snake or a scorpion never harmed anyone in Jerusalem, and no one ever said to his neighbor \"Jerusalem is 'too tight' for me to live in.\" [because the place afforded them a livelihood, and there was no need for anyone to leave and say \"Things are 'too tight' for me and I cannot live in Jerusalem.\" Some editions have \"to sleep over\" (instead of \"to live in\"), the reference being to the festival pilgrims, none of them finding it too difficult to sleep over in Jerusalem because of lack of space (see Yoma 21b)].",
            "\tTen things were created on the eve of Sabbath at twilight, [i.e., on the eve of the Sabbath of the creation, before its completion]: the mouth of the earth [to swallow up Korach and his congregation], the mouth of the well [of Miriam, which accompanied Israel in the desert in all of its journeyings. (Some say that it opened its mouth and sang (Numbers 21:17): \"Arise, O, Well, sing to her!\"], the mouth of [Bilam's] ass, [At twilight it was decreed that it speak with Bilam], the rainbow, [as a sign of the covenant that a second flood would not occur], the manna [that descended for Israel forty years in the desert], the [sapphire] staff, [with which the signs were performed], the shamir [a type of worm the size of a barley grain. When they held it over the stones figured with ink, they split of themselves. With it they formed the stones of the ephod and the choshen, viz. (Exodus 28:20): \"With their (exact) fillings\"], the writing, [the form of the letters carved on the tablets], the inscription, [their being read from all four sides], and the tablets. [They were of sapphire. Their length was six (ells); their breadth was six, and their thickness was three, like one stone, whose length and breadth and thickness are uniform. It was divided into two. And they were rolled and hewn from the solar orb.] Some say, also the mazikkin, [the demons. After the Holy One Blessed be He created Adam and Eve, He was preoccupied with their creation, and when He created their spirits, He had not created their bodies by the advent of the Sabbath, so that they remained spirits without bodies], and the grave of Moses, and the ram of our father Abraham. [It was decreed at twilight that it be caught in the thicket by its horns]. Some say: Also the tongs, made from a tongs. [The tongs is made only from another tongs. And who made the first tongs? Perforce we must say that it was made by itself (i.e., by Heaven); and it was created at twilight. This is rejected by the Gemara (Pesachim 54a), which states that the first tongs could have been cast in a mold and forged at once.]",
            "\tSeven things characterize a golam, [from \"golmei kelim,\" \"unfinished vessels.\" So, a man who is not \"finished\" in mind, middoth, or wisdom is called a \"golam.\"], and seven characterize a sage: A sage does not speak in the presence of one who is greater than he in wisdom. [For thus do we find with Elazar and Itamar (Leviticus 10:16-19), who declined to speak in the presence of their father (Aaron) when Moses became angry with them, and Aaron answered], and he does not interrupt the words of his neighbor, [so as not to confuse him, viz. (Bamidbar 12:6): \"Hear, now, My words,\" i.e., Wait until I (the L rd) have finished speaking — a fortiori for a man (who can be confused)], and he is not hasty to answer, so that his answer be appropriate, as in the instance of Elihu, who said (Iyyov 36:2): \"Wait for me awhile and I will tell you.\"], he asks on the subject and he answers according to the halachah. [This is one of the seven. The disciple asks on the subject, i.e., the subject that is being discussed, and then the Rabbi answers according to the halachah. But if the disciple does not ask on the subject, he brings the Rabbi to answer not according to the halachah, as R. Chiyya says to Rav: \"When Rabbi is occupied with this tractate, do not ask him from a different tractate,\" and as in the instance of those men, who being unclean by reason of (contact with) a dead body, and seeing Moses occupied with the halachoth of the Pesach offering, asked him (the halachah) on that subject.], and he answers the first (question) first, and the last, last, [as we find with the Holy One Blessed be He, whom Moses asked (Exodus 3:11): \"Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should take the children of Israel out of Egypt?\", who answered the first question (Ibid. 12): \"For I shall be with you,\" and the second (Ibid.): \"When you take the people out of Egypt, you shall serve G-d, etc.\"], and of what he has not heard, he says \"I have not heard it.\" [If he renders a ruling on his own, he does not say \"Thus have I heard from my Rabbis.\" And we find with the men of Charan, that when Jacob asked them (Genesis 29:6): \"Is he (Lavan) well?\" they said to him: \"(He is) well, and, behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the flock.\" This (that he is well) we know. And if you would know more, behold his daughter is coming with the flock,\" and she will tell you; for we do not know more than this.], and he admits the truth, [even though he can argue for his view. And thus do we find with Moses (Leviticus 10:19) when Aaron refuted him, saying [If you have heard (from the L rd) that this (such eating) is permitted with kodshim for a particular occasion (the investiture), this is no license for permitting it in \"ongoing\" kodshim (such as the Rosh Chodesh goat). (Ibid. 20): \"And Moses heard and it was good in his eyes.\" He admitted (that he had heard this from the L rd but had forgotten instead of \"covering up\" (by saying that he had not heard)].

If (all) resolved not to tithe, a famine of tumult [(The harvest cannot be gathered because of invading armies)] and dearth comes. If (they resolved) not to take challah, a famine of destruction comes. [The heavens are like iron and the earth like copper.] Pestilence comes to the world for the death penalties in the Torah, which did not come to [adjudication in ] the beth-din and for the fruits of the sabbatical year, [with which business was done and which were not kept in the sanctity of the sabbatical year.] A sword comes to the world for delay of judgment, [when it is known where the din inclines] and for perversion of justice, [vindicating the guilty and incriminating the innocent], and for ruling in Torah (law) not in accordance with the halachah, [forbidding the permitted, and permitting the forbidden].",

Exile comes to the world because of idolators, illicit relations, bloodshed and (not) leaving the land idle [i.e., plowing and sewing on the sabbatical year]. In four periods pestilence increases: in the fourth year (of shemitah), and in the seventh year, and at the conclusion of the seventh year, and at the conclusion of the festival (of Succoth) of every year. In the fourth year, because of (omission of) the poor-tithe of the third year.

In the seventh year, because of (omission of ) the poor-tithe of the sixth year.

Some say: This is the middah of Sodom. [It approaches the middah of Sodom. For if one habituates himself to it, then even if his neighbor benefits (from what he gives him) and he lacks nothing, he will not want to give it to him. This was the middah of Sodom, their intent being to drive others away from them — even though their land was a rich one and they lacked for nothing.] \"Mine is yours and yours is mine\" — am ha'aretz (an ignoramus). [For he takes and gives equally, and this \"settles the land.\" But he does not (have the sagacity to) know that (Proverbs 15:27): \"the hater of gifts shall live.\" This is the general connotation of am ha'aretz, one who wants to make improvements but who lacks the wisdom to discriminate between what is and what is not an improvement.] \"Mine is yours and yours is yours\" — a chasid. [He benefits men with his possessions and he does not benefit from the possessions of others. He is a chasid, acting above and beyond the letter of the law.] \"Mine is mine and yours is mine\" — a wicked one.",

But if one is angered with difficulty, even though he has the evil middah of being pacified with difficulty, his (relatively) small loss, being pacified with difficulty, is negated by his (relatively) greater gain, being angered with difficulty, so that most of his acts are praiseworthy. Some versions are the opposite of this; but this seems to be the correct version.]; angered with difficulty and easily pacified — a chasid; easily angered and pacified with difficulty — a wicked one.",

A practical application. If there are two disciples before us and we can provide tuition only for one, the forgetter with difficulty takes precedence over the quick to understand.]; quick to understand and forgetting with difficulty — a wise (disciple);.

A sponge — it absorbs everything; a funnel — it takes in at one end and releases at the other. [So, there is a disciple who emits whatever he absorbs]; a strainer — it releases the wine and retains the lees. [So, there is a disciple who releases whatever he has learned in the house of study and retains only idle talk]; and a sieve — it releases the flour and retains the meal. [After the bran and the bruised grain are extracted from the ground flour, and there remain the thin flour with the thick meal, the desired part, it is put through a very thin sieve, so that there descends all that thin flour, like a white powder, and there remains only the thick, desirable, meal.

Yehoshua ben Levi said: \"Every day a Heavenly voice goes forth from Mount Chorev and proclaims: \"Woe unto the creations for the shame of Torah!\" For whoever does not occupy himself with Torah is called \"rejected,\" as it is written (Proverbs 11:22): \"As a golden ring in the snout of a pig, so is a beautiful woman from whom wisdom has departed,\" and (Exodus 32:16): \"And the tablets were the work of G-d and the writing was the writing of G-d, engraved (charuth) upon the tablets.\" Read it not \"charuth,\" but \"cheiruth\" (freedom), for no one is free but him who studies Torah. For whoever studies Torah is exalted, as it is written (Numbers 21:19): \"And from Matanah (the gift [of Torah]), Nachliel ('the inheritance of the L rd'); and from Nachliel, Bamoth ('the high mount').\"",
            "\tIf one learns from his friend one chapter or one halachah or one verse or one word or even one letter, he must accord him honor. For thus do we find with David, king of Israel, who learned from Achitofel two things alone and called him his master, his teacher, and his preceptor, as it is written (Psalms 55:14): \"And you (Achitofel), a man of my regard, my teacher and my preceptor.\" Now does this not follow a fortiori, viz.: If David, king of Israel, who learned from Achitofel only two things alone, called him his master, his teacher and his preceptor — then one who learns from his friend one chapter or one halachah or one verse or even one letter, how much more so should he accord him honor! And there is no honor but Torah, as it is written (Proverbs 3:35): \"The wise inherit honor,\" and (Ibid 28:10): \"And the perfect (in Torah) will inherit good,\" and there is no \"good\" but Torah, viz. (Ibid. 4:2): \"For a goodly acquisition have I given you — do not forsake My Torah.\"",
            "\tThis is the way of Torah: A loaf with salt shall you eat, and water by measure shall you drink, and on the ground shall you sleep, and a life of travail shall you live, and in Torah shall you toil. And if you do so — you are fortunate and it is good for you. You are fortunate in this world and it is good for you in the world to come. Do not seek greatness for yourself, and do not lust for honor. More than your learning, do! And do not lust for the table of princes. For your table is greater than theirs, and your crown is greater than theirs, and your Master is trusted to pay you the wage of your work.",
            "\tTorah is greater than priesthood and than kingship. For kingship is acquired with thirty eminences and priesthood with twenty-four, whereas Torah is acquired with forty-eight. They are: learning, the hearing of the ear, the articulation of the lips, the understanding of the heart, intuition, awe, fear, humility, joy, attendance upon the wise, the probing of the friends, the dialectics of the disciples, with deliberation, with Scripture, with Mishnah, with diminution of trade, of sleep, of pleasure, of laughter, (and) of cohabitation, with patience, with forbearance, with a good heart, with faith in the sages, and with the acceptance of afflictions.",

            "\tR. Yossi b. Kisma said: \"Once I was walking along the road when a certain man met me and greeted me and I greeted him in return. He asked me: 'Rebbi, where are you from?' I answered: 'From a great city of sages and scribes.' He replied: \"Rebbi, please live with us in our place and I will give you thousands upon thousands of golden dinars and precious stones and pearls.' I said to him: 'My son, if you gave me all the silver and gold and precious stones and pearls in the world I would live only in a place of Torah. For when a man dies there accompany him neither silver nor gold nor precious stones nor pearls, but Torah and good deeds alone.'\" As it is written (Proverbs 6:22): \"In your going forth, it will lead you, in your lying down, it will guard you, and in your waking, it will be your converse.\" \"In your going forth, it will lead you\" — in this world; \"in your lying down it will guard you\" — in the grave; \"in your waking, it will be your converse\" — in the world to come. And thus is it written in the book of Psalms of David, king of Israel (Psalms 119:72): \"Better to me the Torah of Your mouth than thousands in gold and silver,\" and (Chaggai 2:8): \"Mine is the silver and Mine the gold, says the L rd of hosts.\"",
