            "Leviticus 15 (text is found below) distinguishes between a woman who discharges blood during her menstrual period (vs. 19-24) and a woman who discharges blood not during her menstrual period (vs. 25-30). There are rules (these will get a bit more complicated) that distinguish between the two. Here they are briefly: When a woman first establishes her menstrual cycle, the blood is considered to be menstrual blood. She is now impure for seven days, no matter how many days she menstruates. As long as she stops bleeding by the seventh day she goes to the mikveh at the end of the seventh day and she is pure (actual practice differs, as we shall discuss later).  After seven days she now enters what are called \"the days of zivah\" meaning non-menstrual blood. If she bleeds on one of these days, she at first will observe one day of purity for every day of blood. So if she bleeds on the eighth day, she will go to the mikveh on the ninth day and observe purity for that day and then if she sees no more blood, she will be pure in the evening. The same is true if she sees blood on the ninth day as well. She will go to the mikveh on the tenth day and is pure at night. However, if she sees blood for three days in a row then she will need to go through \"seven clean days\" where she does not discharge blood. After seven clean days she goes to the mikveh and then brings a sacrifice and she is pure.  According to rabbinic calculation there are eleven days of \"zivah\" between a woman's menstrual period and her next period. During these eleven days, if she discharges blood it is considered \"zivah\" (non-menstrual blood) and she observes one day of purity for each day or seven days if she bleeds three straight days. After these eleven days are completed, she begins a seven day period during which any blood is considered menstrual blood. This pattern will then repeat itself. The above rules are according to the Torah's rules. Late in the tannaitic period some Jews began to act more stringently and treat all blood as if it was zivah. Functionally what this means is that a woman will always observe seven clean days after the end of her menstrual period. So, according to Torah law if a woman has menstrual blood for five days she would be clean after the seventh day. But according to post-talmudic practice, she will need to wait seven more days and will be clean only on the 12th day.  Tractate Niddah will also deal with the blood discharged by a woman after childbirth.  An important issue to remember while learning this tractate is that the practical significance of the laws of niddah was much broader than it is today. The mishnah portrays a world in which people observe the full array of purity laws. A woman who was unclean due to menstruation would defile terumah and hallah and other holy foods. Today, we think of these laws as limited to the permissibility of sexual relations between a man and a woman. While this was certainly an issue in mishnaic times as well, it is important to remember that it wasn't the only issue.   Finally, a note on my treatment of this material. A woman's menstruation can be a sensitive and personal issue. I will try to keep a \"clinical\" tone throughout my commentary, avoiding both apologetics and criticism. I believe that it is important for people to understand the technicalities of this system, before they attempt to delve into any greater socio-religious meaning. I also think that the rabbinic discussion of the material is in itself clinical, or perhaps mathematical. The rabbis are intensely interested in the intricacies of halakhah and spend little time discussing how such issues would affect a woman's life. This is simply the nature of the discussion.  Below are most of the verses relevant to the subject of menstrual and non-menstrual blood. We will make frequent reference to them throughout the commentary. ",
            "Leviticus Chapter 12 1 The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 2 Speak to the Israelite people thus: When a woman at childbirth bears a male, she shall be unclean seven days; she shall be unclean as at the time of her menstrual infirmity. — 3 On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. — 4 She shall remain in a state of blood purification for thirty-three days: she shall not touch any consecrated thing, nor enter the sanctuary until her period of purification is completed. 5 If she bears a female, she shall be unclean two weeks as during her menstruation, and she shall remain in a state of blood purification for sixty-six days.",
            "Leviticus Chapter 15 6 On the completion of her period of purification, for either son or daughter, she shall bring to the priest, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, a lamb in its first year for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering. 7 He shall offer it before the Lord and make expiation on her behalf; she shall then be clean from her flow of blood. Such are the rituals concerning her who bears a child, male or female. 8 If, however, her means do not suffice for a sheep, she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. The priest shall make expiation on her behalf, and she shall be clean. 19 When a woman has a discharge, her discharge being blood from her body, she shall remain in her impurity seven days; whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening. 20 Anything that she lies on during her impurity shall be unclean; and anything that she sits on shall be unclean. 21 Anyone who touches her bedding shall wash his clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening; 22 and anyone who touches any object on which she has sat shall wash his clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. 23 Be it the bedding or be it the object on which she has sat, on touching it he shall be unclean until evening. 24 And if a man lies with her, her impurity is communicated to him; he shall be unclean seven days, and any bedding on which he lies shall become unclean. 25 When a woman has had a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her impurity, or when she has a discharge beyond her period of impurity, she shall be unclean, as though at the time of her impurity, as long as her discharge lasts. 26 Any bedding on which she lies while her discharge lasts shall be for her like bedding during her impurity; and any object on which she sits shall become unclean, as it does during her impurity: 27 whoever touches them shall be unclean; he shall wash his clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. 28 When she becomes clean of her discharge, she shall count off seven days, and after that she shall be clean. 29 On the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, and bring them to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 30 The priest shall offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering; and the priest shall make expiation on her behalf, for her unclean discharge, before the Lord."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nToday's mishnah deals with a woman who discovers that she has had her menstrual period but is not sure when it began. The question is at what point does she have to assume that she was already impure such that the things that she touched must be considered impure?",
                    "<b>Shammai says: for all women it suffices [to reckon] their [period of uncleanness from their time [of discovering the flow]. Hillel ruled: [their period of uncleanness is to be reckoned retroactively] from the [previous] examination to the [last] examination, even if this was many days. The sages say: [the law is] not like the words of these or the words of those, but [the women are deemed to have been unclean] during [the preceding] twenty-four hours  when this  lessens the period from the [previous] examination to the [last] examination, and during the period from the [previous] examination to the [last] examination when this  lessens the period of twenty-four hours.</b>  There are three different opinions as to how far back a woman (who does not have a regular menstrual cycle) must assume she was impure after she has discovered her period. Shammai is most lenient. She is considered impure only from the moment in which she discovers that she has had her period. If, for instance, she discovered her period in the afternoon, the pure things that she touched in the morning remain pure. Hillel rules most strictly. She is reckoned impure from the last time that she checked herself, even if it has been many days. Hillel is concerned that immediately after her last clean check (when she didn't find that she was bleeding) she began to bleed and just didn't notice it. Therefore, anything she has touched since the last clean check must be considered defiled. The sages' opinion falls somewhere in between the two. There are two time periods that play into account twenty-four hours and the last clean examination. A woman cannot be retroactively considered unclean for more than 24 hours. She also is clean from the last time she had a clean examination. She is therefore considered unclean from whatever is the lesser of the two. If she examined herself in the morning and found herself clean and then discovered her period in the evening, anything she touched after the clean examination is unclean. But if she examined herself on Sunday morning and then found herself unclean on Monday evening, only the things that she touched over the last 24 hours are considered impure.",
                    "<b>For any woman who has a regular period it suffices [to reckon her period of uncleanness from] the time she discovers the flow.</b>  All of the above refers only to a woman who has not established a regular menstrual cycle. If she has a regular cycle, she defiles things only from the time in which she discovered that she was menstruating.",
                    "<b>And if a woman uses rags when she has marital intercourse, this is like an examination which lessens either the period of the [past] twenty-four hours or the period from the [previous] examination to the [last] examination.</b>  A woman who cleans herself with rags after sexual intercourse is considered to have examined herself. If she doesn't find blood on the rags, and then sees blood later, she defiles only the things that she has touched since she cleaned herself with these rags. In other words, although the purpose of these rags is not for self-examination, since blood would be noticed, it counts as an examination."

                    "<b>How [does the rule that] it suffices [to reckon her period of uncleanness from] the time she discovers the flow work?</b>  This refers to a woman that has a regular menstrual cycle. As we learned in yesterday's mishnah, she is considered to be impure only from the moment in which she observes a blood flow. She doesn’t retroactively defile anything.",
                    "<b>If she was sitting on a bed and was occupied with ritually clean objects and then she leaves [the bed] and then sees [blood flow] she is unclean but the objects are clean.</b>  Although in this case it is exceedingly likely that the blood flow started while she was still in bed, since she has a regular cycle, only the things that she touched after she discovered the blood flow are impure. The bed and any other pure things she touched earlier remain pure. This seems to be a case in which the rabbis rule created an intentional leniency, one that might even be seen as ignoring what likely happened.",
                    "<b>Even though they have said that she conveys uncleanness for a period of twenty-four hours [retroactively]   she counts [the seven days of her menstruation]   only from the time she observed the flow.</b>  This section addresses a woman who does not have a regular menstrual cycle and therefore retroactively defiles anything she touched in the 24 hour period before she discovered that she was bleeding. Nevertheless, when it comes to counting the days of her menstruation during which she is impure, she does not count from the earlier time period. She counts from when she noticed that she was bleeding. This is because the 24 hour period is a stringency she may have been bleeding as early at that period therefore anything she touched must be considered impure. But since she only knows that she began menstruating at a later time, she counts her days only from then."

A virgin, A pregnant woman, A nursing woman; And an old woman.</b>  According to Rabbi Eliezer, there are four types of women who, since it is not common for them to menstruate, need not be concerned lest their menstrual flow started earlier than they discovered it. They defile only the things they touch after they discovered that they were bleeding. The following mishnayot will elaborate more on each of these women.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Joshua says: I have only heard [the ruling applied to] a virgin, but the halakhah is in agreement with Rabbi Eliezer.</b>  Rabbi Joshua initially seems to adopt a traditional approach here. He restricts the halakhah to the tradition that he received this law applies only to a virgin. We should note that it is usually Rabbi Eliezer who acts as a traditionalist. However, if the last sentence of the mishnah is also the words of Rabbi Joshua, then he too admits that even though he only heard a limited ruling, the halakhah is in accord with the expanded version put forth by Rabbi Eliezer. We might surmise that if the original tradition referred only to a virgin (as R. Joshua claims), the expanded version (which includes all four categories) reasoned that if it is sufficient to reckon the uncleanness of a virgin from the time of discovery because she does not regularly menstruate, the same would be true of other women who don't regularly menstruate. And if you are surprised that a \"virgin\" doesn't regularly menstruate, the rabbinic definition will be in tomorrow's mishnah. Stay tuned."

It does not refer to a woman who has never had sexual intercourse. According to this definition of a \"virgin\" which probably should be translated as \"young girl\", even a married woman could be a virgin.",

According to Rabbi Meir, since she is no longer nursing, she is no longer in the category of a woman who does not need to be retroactively concerned that she defiled things. When she discovers that she is bleeding, everything that touched in the previous 24 hours is impure. The sages disagree and consider this woman to still be in the category of a nursing woman. It seems that they think that she probably won't resume menstruating for this period."

A woman who has stopped menstruating due to menopause is old for the issue discussed in this mishnah what type of woman does not regularly menstruate.",

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nToday's mishnah teaches that although women who have regular menstrual cycle do not retroactively defile things (see mishnah one), they should examine themselves at certain prescribed time regularly to make sure that they has not begun to menstruate.",
                    "<b>Although though they said [that for a woman who has a regular period] it suffices to reckon her period of uncleanness from the time she observes a flow, she should nevertheless examine herself [regularly],  except for a menstruant or one who is sitting over pure blood.</b>  Even a woman who has a regular menstrual cycle should still examine herself regularly to make sure she has not begun to menstruate. I should note here that most women might find this strange don't women know when they are menstruating, even without checking? Truthfully, I think this is a legitimate complaint against the rabbis, but if I were to offer a defense I might say two things. First of all, the rabbis were men who obviously knew nothing about what it might feel like to be menstruating. Second, women had frequent contact with the food and the instruments whose purity should be preserved. Therefore, a woman who was impure and didn't know that she was could defile a lot of terumah or vessels used with terumah. To avoid this serious problem, the rabbis mandated that all women examine themselves regularly. There are two types of women who don't need to examine themselves regularly. The first is obviously a woman who is already menstruating. The second is a woman who has recently given birth. Leviticus 12:4-5 prescribes 33 days following a seven day period of impurity for a boy or 66 days following a 14 day impurity period for a girl in which a woman's blood flow is pure. Since any such blood is considered pure, there would be no practical reason for her to examine herself.",
                    "<b>She should also use testing-rags when she has marital intercourse except when she is sitting over pure blood or when she is a virgin whose blood is clean.</b>  Generally, a woman should examine herself using examination rags both before and after sexual intercourse. Before intercourse she should examine herself because it is prohibited to have intercourse when she is menstruating. Afterwards she should examine herself to make sure that she has not defiled her husband. Obviously, a \"virgin\" referred to in this mishnah is not a woman who has never had sex. Rather, it is a woman who has not yet begun to menstruate, as we learned in mishnah four. A woman who is married before she begins to menstruate need not check herself.",

Without an examination, , she will defile everything which she had contact with during the previous twenty-four hours. Such a woman should examine herself in the morning to make sure that any pure things that she worked with at night were not defiled. She should also examine herself in the evening to make sure that the stuff that she worked with during the day was not defiled.",

Rabbi Judah said: [these must examine themselves] also after they have concluded eating terumah.</b>  Priestly women (either daughters of priests or wives of priests) who are regularly occupying themselves with terumah should examine themselves even more regularly. According to the first opinion, they should examine themselves before they eat terumah so that they do not defile the terumah that they are about to eat. Rabbi Judah says that they should examine themselves after eating as well. If she is found to be pure, then even the leftover crumbs are pure. In contrast, had she not checked herself afterward and then later that day (or night) found that she had begun to menstruate, the leftover terumah that she had touched would have to be considered impure."

Such frequent examinations would ensure that she didn't defile vessels and food and it would make sure that she didn't have intercourse while menstruating. However, the rabbis took quite a strict stance against male masturbation. \"Spilling the seed\" was a grave sin according to rabbinic halakhah. The rabbis feared that a man who frequently checked to see if he had ejaculated would cause himself (either intentionally or unintentionally) to ejaculate.

However, because she was in labor, we considered the blood to be menstrual blood, as we saw in section one. But then she ceased having pains. When she gives birth, we now can consider the blood to be zivah blood. In other words, since the pains stopped, the blood is considered to be zivah after all and not from the birth itself.

[This is frequently the case in rabbinic literature. The rabbis wish to discuss legally complex cases, not ones that actually happen most frequently]. A woman gave birth to a girl and then was impure for 14 days. After this time she went to the mikveh and then had relations with her husband (I know, a bit quick, but possible). She became pregnant and was already having pain and blood during the 66 day period in which the blood is considered pure. Note that she knows that this blood is from the new pregnancy, and not the old one. The rabbis hold that this blood is clean until she gives birth again. At this point, if we are sure it is a birth, then she will again be impure with birth uncleanness. Rabbi Eliezer says that since we know that this blood is not from the previous birth, in which case it would be clean, but rather from the difficult labor due to the subsequent birth, we must consider this blood to be unclean. She will have the uncleanness of a menstruant, as was the case in yesterday's mishnah.",

A woman who is pregnant and discharges blood but doesn't have any labor pains is considered a zavah. Her blood is not considered menstrual rather the greater stringency of zivah applies. Nevertheless, if she was in hard labor at the time, the blood would be considered birth blood, which would give her the status of a niddah and not a zavah. Therefore, in a case where the law is generally lenient, during the days of her purity (the 80 days after the birth of a girl), when all her blood is considered pure, so too we should be lenient with regard to blood that comes from labor pains. She should be a niddah and not a zavah.",

The leniency during pregnancy was that she was not a zavah she was only a niddah. So when we derive a law from this situation, we don't need to say that she is pure. It is enough to say that the derived status is the same as that from which it derived. Just as her blood had the status of niddah during her pregnancy, so too during the 80 days of purity, blood due to hard labor has the status of niddah."

At the core of this notion is their understanding of the physical consequences of intercourse for the first time namely the breaking of the woman's hymen. As we can see at the end of the mishnah, if a girl has intercourse (i.e. is raped) before the age of three her hymen will repair itself. After the age of three, it will not. This, to the rabbis, means that after the age of three, intercourse \"counts\" in a legal sense. Before the age of three, it does not.\nHaving taught this mishnah (and others like it) many times, I realize that this is a very sensitive issue. To talk about sex with young girls is very troubling.

It is unlikely that in reality a father stopped exerting his decision making authority over his daughters at such a young age even today father's authority over their children extends well past this age.

Section five: This somewhat complicated halakhah has to do with counting a woman’s menstrual cycle, in order to know the difference between menstrual blood (which causes a woman to be impure for 7 days, even if she continued to bleed all the way through the seventh and non-menstrual blood (which causes a woman to be impure for one day, unless she sees blood for three straight days, in which case she is impure for 7 full days after she stops seeing. The rabbis instituted an 18 day cycle to calculate when blood was menstrual and when it is non-menstrual. When a woman first sees blood she considers it to be menstrual blood and she is impure for seven days, from the time she saw the first blood. After these seven days, any blood seen over the next 11 days is considered to be zivah (non-menstrual. After these eleven days are over, she returns to counting seven days, during which any blood is considered to be menstrual blood. Our mishnah deals with a situation where a woman made a mistake in counting these days (i.e. she didn’t know whether she was in the seven days or in the and she saw blood. She doesn’t know whether the blood she saw is to be considered menstrual, in which case she is impure for seven days, or zivah, in which case she is impure for only one day, or a full seven days if she sees zivah for three straight days. Our mishnah teaches that the beginning of her days of menstrual blood cannot be less then seven days after she doesn’t see any more blood, nor more than seventeen days, all counted from the time she first saw blood. How this works out is a bit complicated, but I shall try to explain very briefly. Let’s say she saw blood for one day, if these were “days of niddah” she could begin to count her next days of niddah after seventeen days, which is the maximum amount. This would mirror the normal situation. However, if she sees blood for several straight days, it may be possible that she only has to wait seven more days after not seeing blood to begin counting her menstrual blood days. Let’s say she sees blood for three straight days, she can then begin counting her menstrual days after seven days without seeing blood, because it doesn’t matter if the blood she saw was menstrual or not, seven days are sufficient to begin counting again. I realize that this is all very complicated, and indeed entire books exist dedicated to these complicated calculations. We will learn much more about this subject when we learn Tractate Niddah.</b><br>Section one: According to Rabbi Meir, if a woman finds a blood stain on her clothing she is in a \"spoiled condition.\" What this means is that since she doesn't know when the blood stain got there she doesn't know when to begin counting the eleven days of \"zivah\" the eleven days in which blood is considered zivah and not menstruation. This is a complicated system of calculation that I explained in Arakhin 2:1. For your benefit I have put the explanation of this clause below.<br>Furthermore, if she sees the stain three days into her wearing the garment during the \"days of zivah,\" and the stain is large enough that it could contain three days of blood flow (this is not such a large amount, three split-beans worth of blood) she must be concerned that she had blood flow for three days and therefore she is a zavah.

Paradoxically, the aspersion he casts on Samaritan women (they don't even bother burying their miscarriages) serves to purify their homes, at least from corpse impurity. Since the miscarriages are no longer there, the houses do not defile by overshadowing."

The Samaritans evidently don't follow these rules. Therefore, they are not believed to say that such and such a place is pure. A \"bet ha-peras\" is a place that used to be a graveyard but has been plowed over such that it is difficult to tell what it used to be.

They won't just lie because they don't like us. However, they don't like the cases in which our laws disagree with their way of treating things. In those cases, we fear that they will intentionally lie to us so that we can't observe the system of purity as we understand it."

Instead of searching for a leniency, they feel that Rabbi Akiva should have ruled strictly. Indeed, it is not that likely that the blood came from a wound that had already healed. Rabbi Akiva responds to them that from the Torah, only an actual blood flow can make a woman impure. The fact that a blood stain counts as a sign of impurity is a ruling of the rabbis. In such a case, we can, and indeed should be, lenient. The blood stain is a sign of impurity only if it is certain that it is menstrual blood."

It is more likely, but not at all certain, that any blood she sees could be menstrual blood. Therefore, Bet Shammai says that only for one night do we say that the blood is virginal. If there is blood the second night, we must assume that it is menstrual. Bet Hillel says that we give her four nights. Since a virgin is married on Wednesday (see Ketubot 1:1) that means that through Saturday night the blood is considered virginal. After that, if she bleeds she will not be able to have relations.",

This is the rule that would govern any woman, assuming she marries after she begins to menstruate. Bet Shammai says that she is allowed to have intercourse one time, and that's it. The first blood is considered virginal but any blood after that is suspected of being menstrual. Bet Hillel says that the husband and wife can have intercourse as many times as they want that night. Any blood seen on the following night would be suspected of being menstrual blood."

She shouldn't touch the water itself, for the rabbis considered it disgraceful that the pesach sacrifice should be in contact with water touched by a t'vul yom.

Afterwards, assumedly by the time of Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai (1st century C.E.) they changed her status to be like a person who had contact with another person who had corpse impurity. Such a person has first degree impurity, and if she were to touch the water, she would defile it and the water would defile the pesah sacrifice.

They also might hold that the main immersion of a childbearing woman comes at the end of the full period, and not the first part of it (7 days for a boy, 14 for a girl).

This means they defile things they sit or lay on, even if they don't directly have contact. Bet Hillel says that they are exempt from a sacrifice, although they do defile, at least derabanan (rabbinically). The reason is that the eleventh day cannot be counted as part of  a three day period of zivah, the amount necessary for her to become a \"zavah gedolah.\" For if she had discharge on the 11th, 12th and 13th day, she would not become a zavah gedolah (who is impure for seven days and has to bring a sacrifice) because the latter two days are part of the days of niddah, in the next cycle.

As I always write, it is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Tractate Niddah was not an easy journey, I'll admit. A lot of discussion about private matters in a very graphic way. If there's one larger point I would like to make it is that in biblical and temple times the impurity of a niddah was just one of many forms of impurity, one part of a much larger system. Today, this is virtually the only part of the system that remains (because of the sex prohibition), and it might seem at time that women are being targeted for being women. I don't believe that this is the case and when one learns all of Seder Toharot, and if you've been following along, you're not very far from being one of those people, one can see that impurity occurs in many different ways. That's my two cents. In any case, as always, a hearty yasher koach upon completing the tractate and keep up the good work. Tomorrow we begin Makhshirin."
