            "Get ready to learn a tractate that is literally called \"Cow\"!  The cow referred to here is the red cow (often called the red heifer) whose ashes were used to purify a person that had contracted corpse impurity. The cow is often called \"hatat\" or \"sin-offering\" by the rabbis and the water into which the cow's ashes were put is called \"hatat waters.\" So too the ashes are called \"hatat ash.\" The putting of the ash into the water is called \"kiddush\" or sanctification and sometimes the waters are called \"holy waters.\"  The ritual of the red cow is described in chapter 19 of Numbers, which I have brought from the JPS translation below. It would probably be helpful to read through these verses before you begin to study the Tractate. We shall make reference to them quite frequently, much as we did throughout our study of Negaim. "

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nToday's mishnah discusses how old a \"heifer\" can be before it becomes a cow. This is relevant to two laws. In Deuteronomy 21 we read that in order to expiate for an unsolved murder a ritual with a \"heifer\" must be performed. In order to perform the ritual correctly, we must determine how old a heifer is. And determining how old a \"cow\" is relevant to the issue of our tractate the red cow.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: the heifer is no more than one year old and the cow no more than two years old. But the sages ruled: the heifer may be even two years old and the red cow even three or four years old. Rabbi Meir says: even five years old, though she is old. But they did not wait with it so long since it might in the meantime grow some black hairs and [thus] become invalid.</b>  According to Rabbi Eliezer the heifer whose neck is broken according to Deuteronomy 21 must be less than one year old. The cow must be less than 2 years old. The other sages add a year to both of these numbers. Rabbi Meir rules that a cow can even be 5 years old and still be valid to be used in the red cow ritual. However, if a red cow was born (a highly unusual event) they wouldn't wait five years to use it because if any of its hairs turn black, it becomes invalid.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Joshua said: I only heard of [a cow] that was three years old [shelashit]. They said to him: What does \"shelashit\" mean? He replied: thus have I heard it without any explanation. Ben Azzai said: I will explain: if you say \"shelishit\" the meaning is ‘the third’ in number to others, but when you say \"shelashit\" the meaning is one that is three years old.</b>  The mishnah now begins a series of discussion in which Rabbi Joshua and Ben Azzai participate and which hinge on the precise pronunciation of various words. The first of these discussions is pertinent to the issue of the red cow. Rabbi Joshua asserts that he heard that the cow must be \"shelashit.\" This seems to be an unusual spelling of the Hebrew word for the ordinal number of three third. The other sages ask him why did you say \"shelashit.\" Rabbi Joshua, interestingly, does not know why he pronounced the word in this unusual manner. He just heard \"shelashit\" and repeated what he was taught. Ben Azzai, the younger student, however, has an explanation. Had Rabbi Joshua said \"shelishit,\" the typical pronunciation of the ordinal number, we would have thought that the cow would have to be the third born to its mother. Now that he pronounced the word \"shelashit\" we learn that the cow must be three years old.",
                    "<b>Similarly they said a vineyard that is \"revai.\" They said to him: what does \"revai\" mean? He replied: thus have I heard it without any explanation. Ben Azzai said: I will explain: if you say \"revii\" the meaning is the fourth in number to others, but when you say \"revai\" the meaning is one that is four years old.</b>  The same argument now occurs with regard to a vineyard in its fourth year. This topic is covered in Maaser Sheni 5:1-5. The produce of such a vineyard must be brought to Jerusalem and consumed there. The word for fourth year as pronounced by Rabbi Joshua is \"revai\" instead of the more typical \"revii.\" Again, the other sages ask Rabbi Joshua why he pronounces it this way and he doesn't know how to respond. Ben Azzai explains that had he pronounced it \"revii\" we might have thought that it was fourth in number. This could mean that it is the fourth vineyard owned by the owners or that it is the fourth vineyard planted in this field. Now that it is pronounced \"revai\" we learn that the these laws refer to a vineyard planted in its fourth year.",
                    "<b>Similarly it was ruled: if a man ate in an afflicted house half a loaf, three of which can be made from a kav, he becomes unclean. They said to him: say rather \"eighteen of which are made of a se'ah.\" He replied: thus have I heard it without any explanation. Ben Azzai said: I will explain: when you say, three of which are made of a kav it would not contain hallah, but if you say, eighteen of which are made of a se'ah, it has been reduced by its hallah.</b>  The final issue has to deal with a halakhah that came up in the last tractate we learned Negaim. If a person goes into a house afflicted with some sort of scaly plague and stays there long enough to eat half of a loaf of bread, when three loaves are made of a kav of flour, becomes impure. The rabbis ask why he expresses the amount as \"three loaves in a kav\" instead of \"eighteen loaves in a seah.\" A seah is 6 kavs, so the ratio stays the same. Ben Azzai explains that had one made 18 loaves he would actually have to give some as \"hallah,\" dough offering, to the priest. This would reduce (by a small amount) the size of each loaf. But three loaves of bread is too small of an amount to be liable for hallah. Therefore, the amount of the loaf is precise."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThere are many occasions when the Torah mandates sacrificing a \"par\" or a bull. In today's mishnah there are three opinions as to how old the bull must be.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Yose the Galilean said: bulls must be no more than two years old, for it is said, \"And the second bull you shall take for a sin-offering\" (Numbers 8:8).</b>  Rabbi Yose the Galilean bases his halakhah on a midrash on Numbers 8:8. The verse says that one should take the \"second bull.\" Since the Torah states elsewhere said to take two bulls and one has already been sacrificed why does it need to say \"second.\" From this \"extraneous\" word Rabbi Yose the Galilean concludes that the word \"second\" refers to how old the bull must be two years.",
                    "<b>But the sages say: they may be even three years old.</b>  The sages say that the bull can even be three years old. There are some versions that don't include the word \"even.\" According to this, the rabbis hold that it must be three years old.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Meir says: even those that are four or five years old are valid, but old animals are not brought out of respect.</b>  Rabbi Meir again provides a much higher limit for the age of the animal being discussed (as he did in yesterday's mishnah). However, despite the fact that one can bring a relatively old animal, it is not respectful to do so because it looks as if he is offering this animal only because it will die soon anyway."

                [
                    "<b>Lambs no more than one year old, And rams no more than two years old.</b>  When the Torah mandates bringing a lamb-offering, it must be within its first year. This is explicit in the Torah, see for instance Numbers 7:17. Rams adult sheep must be at least within their second year.",
                    "<b>And all these years are reckoned from day to day.</b>  When counting the age of any of the animals listed in the first three mishnayot of this tractate, we count from the day the animal was born. We don't count from the beginning of the year, as we do for other matters. So a lamb born in the beginning of Elul is not considered to be one year old until the following Elul.",
                    "<b>One that is thirteen months old is not valid, neither as a ram nor as a lamb. Rabbi Tarfon called it palges. Ben Azzai called it noked. Rabbi Ishmael called it parakhrigma.</b>  A 13 month old sheep cannot be considered a lamb or a ram. It is too old to be a lamb and a sheep is not a ram until it is 30 days past its first birthday. The 30 days is likely to be a vestige of the notion that the life of anything born is considered precarious until it has reached thirty days old. It's almost as if we count the animal's days only from one month and on (although this is only in cases in which the rule is stringent when it comes to the limit of a lamb, it is one year, and not 13 months). The sages all have a special name for this 13 month old sheep. Palges is a Greek word which refers to something that is no longer a child but has not reached maturity (kind of like a teenager). Noked is a type of inferior sheep. And parakhrigma is a Greek word used to refer to a coin with a king's image that has been invalidated by the new king. The 13 month old has been disqualified from being a \"lamb\" but has not yet been validated as a \"ram.\"",
                    "<b>If a man offered it he must bring for it the libation of a ram, but it is not counted as his offering.</b>  If a person sacrifices a 13 month old sheep he must bring the libations that are brought for a ram. This means 2 tenths of an ephah of flour, a third of a hin of oil and a third of a hin of wine (see Numbers 15:6-7). However, offering this animal doesn't count as fulfilling his obligation. So if he vowed to bring a ram or a lamb, the thirteen month old doesn't count and he still has to bring another one.",
                    "<b>One that is thirteen months old behold it is a ram.</b>  Once it reaches 13 months and one day it is a ram."

If they were offered on the eighth day they are valid.</b>  The sin-offerings of the congregation are the goats that are brought on Rosh Hodesh and other holidays. These must be within their first year. The burnt-offerings are lambs (see Numbers 28). The sin-offering of an individual can be a lamb or goat (Leviticus 4:28ff). The guilt offering of a nazirite (Numbers 6:12) and the guilt offering of a metzora (Leviticus 14:12) are both lambs. Since all of these are mandatory offerings, it is mandated that one let them grow a little bit before they are brought. Although they are valid from the 8th day and onwards, they should not be brought until they are at least 30 days old. No animal can be slaughtered or sacrificed before the 8th day, as is stated explicitly in Leviticus 22:27.",
                    "<b>Vow-offerings and freewill-offerings, firstlings and the tithe of cattle and the pesach are valid from the eighth day onwards, and also on the eighth day.</b>  Vow offerings and freewill offerings are voluntary, therefore they can be offered on the eighth day and onwards. Since people are not mandated to bring them, we don't make them wait until the 30th day to do so. As far as the firstling (the first-born animal to its mother) goes, the Torah specifically says that that on the 8th day you should give it to the Lord (Exodus 22:29). The cattle tithe and the pesah are both compared to the firstling (see Zevahim 5:8). Therefore they too can be offered from the 8th day and onwards."

In mishnah four of this chapter we shall see a dispute as to whether a cow that has mated with a bull is valid. In contrast, the sages say that a pregnant cow is akin to two cows, which means it is not valid for the red cow hatat.",

All sacrifices, both public and private may be brought from animals raised outside the land of Israel, even if they are bought from non-Jews. The remainder of this mishnah is brought here from Menahot 8:1. My commentary here is the same as there. All menahot (grain offerings) can come from grain grown either in or outside the land of Israel. They can also come from new produce or aged produce. There are two exceptions: the omer barley offering brought on the second day of Pesah and the two loaves brought on Shavuot. With regard to the omer it is stated in Leviticus 23:10, “When you come into the land…you shall bring the omer, the first of your harvest.” With regard to the two loaves it states there in verses 16-17, “And you shall offer a new minhah to the Lord, from your dwelling places you shall bring it.” Both of these verses teach that the omer and the two loaves must come from the new harvest and from grain grown in the land of Israel."

Rabbi Eliezer says that it is valid, as it says, \"You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord your God,\" (Deuteronomy 23:19) and this was not brought into the house.</b>  Deuteronomy 23:19 forbids one from bringing as a sacrifice an animal that was used to pay a harlot or an animal that was sold to buy a dog. The first opinion in the mishnah states that if a red cow was used for either of these purposes, it too is invalid as a hatat cow. However, Rabbi Eliezer says that the verse only prohibits actually sacrifices to be brought from such animals. The red cow is not brought into the Temple and thus if used for either of these purposes, it is valid. In addition, there is a debate concerning a red cow that is born through a caesarean section literally in Hebrew one that is born from the side of its mother. In Bekhorot 7:7 we learned that an animal born through caesarean section cannot be sacrificed. Here we learn that it can also not be used as a red cow hatat, according to the sages.

One interpretation of this debate that makes sense to me is that the Pharisees wanted to diminish the power of the sun in matters of ritual purity due to the fact that other Jews of the time used a solar calendar. By making purity depend upon the setting of the sun, it was as if they gave purifying power to the sun itself.

The mishnah refers to a type of impurity called \"madaf impurity.\" This is a light form of impurity that only has relevance in the preparation of the hatat.\nThe mishnah also refers to \"midras impurity.\" Midras impurity is impurity conveyed by leaning upon or moving an object.\nMishnah Hagigah 2:7 taught: \"The garments of [those who eat] sacred things possess midras-impurity for [those who occupy themselves with the waters of] purification.\" What this means is that all garments, even those which have been cleansed enough so that they could be used with holy things, still convey midras impurity to anyone who wishes to perform an action in connection with the red cow ritual.

I shall attempt to explain them one at a time, based on Albeck's interpretation. The baskets of a pack-saddle:  A saddle made of wood placed on a donkey. There are baskets attached to both sides. The bed of a barrow: a vessel used for threshing produce. The corner of a bier: The head of a long bier for carrying a body or some sort of seat. The [drinking] horns of travelers: A vessel used by travelers to draw and store water. A key chain: Same thing you and I still use to this day! The loose stitches of laundry men: Washers loosely stitch clothing together while washing so that it doesn't get lost. And a garment stitched together with kilayim: Kilayim are mixed kinds. Someone stitched together a garment of flax using wool or vice versa. These stitches will have to be removed. All of these vessels are regarded as connected when it comes to the regular laws of purity. If one part is defiled, the other part is defiled as well. However, the laws of sprinkling are more stringent. These things are not considered to be connected. Therefore, if one sprinkles on one, the other part is not yet clean."

It is not limited to priests. However it does limit the following people who do not fall under the rabbinic classification of “ish.” A tumtum is a person who lacks the signs of either gender. A hermaphrodite has both male and female organs. A woman is excluded, according to the rabbis, from the category of “ish.” A child who is too young to intend to perform the sprinkling is also not considered an “ish.”",

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe final mishnah of Parah teaches that the dipping of the hyssop and the sprinkling of the waters must be done during the day. This is derived from the word \"day\" which is repeated in Numbers 19:19, \"The clean person shall sprinkle it upon the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day, thus cleansing him by the seventh day.\"",
                    "<b>If he dipped the hyssop during the day and he sprinkled during the day, it is valid.</b>  This is the proper way for the mitzvah to be performed both actions done during the day.",

                    "<b>But he himself may immerse at night and then sprinkle on the following day, for sprinkling is not allowed until the sun is risen.</b>  While the dipping of the hyssop into the waters and the sprinkling cannot be done at night, the person who is going to perform these rituals can immerse himself at night. This immersion is done in preparation for the hatat ritual.",
                    "<b>And if any of these was done as early as the rise of dawn it is valid.</b>  The dipping and sprinkling should be done during the day, meaning once the sun has risen. But if one did it at first light, at the rise of dawn, it is still valid. This is common to many mitzvoth they should be done after the sun has risen, but if they are done right after dawn, they are valid. See Megillah 2:4. Congratulations! We have completed Tractate Parah! As I always write, it is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Tractate Parah is all about one of the strangest rituals in the Torah. Indeed the rabbis categorize this as the quintessential \"hok\" a law that cannot be interpreted rationally. Nevertheless, despite the fact that we may not really be able to understand the rationale behind this cleansing ritual, I hope that by learning the Mishnah, we are at least able to understand how the rabbis imagined it being performed. Interestingly, qualitatively this tractate doesn't seem to be all that different from many other tractates. The rabbis take some passages in the Torah, interpret their details while using certain principles and explain mostly when something has been performed in a valid manner and when it has been performed in an invalid manner. Perhaps we could say in summary that Tractate Parah takes the admittedly irrational and makes it rational. Tomorrow our learning continues with Tractate Toharot. Good luck to everyone and congratulations on your amazing commitment to learning."
