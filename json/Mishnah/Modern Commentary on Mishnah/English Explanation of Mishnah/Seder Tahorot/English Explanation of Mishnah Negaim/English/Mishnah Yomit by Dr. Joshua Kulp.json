            "Leviticus 13-14 contains lengthy description of some sort of scaly disease that can inflict a person's skin, clothes or a home. Our tractate is an extended commentary, explanation and clarification of these laws. This is not the place for a critical commentary on these laws, why they occupy such an important place in the Torah, their parallels in other ancient cultures, and other such topics. For that I refer the reader to the JPS Commentary on Leviticus, or for more detailed reading, to the Anchor Bible Commentary on Leviticus. I strongly suggest reading these chapters carefully before beginning to learn the mishnaic material. ",
            "A note on my translation: many scholars doubt whether the Torah refers to the disease now known as leprosy. In my translation I have tried to use the transliterated terms as much as possible. This way the description the rabbis provide will speak for itself, rather than knowledge from the outside determining the meaning of these terms. Thus I will use the word \"nega\" or \"negaim\" to mean some sort of skin, clothing or house infliction. The Torah and the rabbis frequently use the word \"baheret\" or \"se'et\" to refer to these \"plagues.\" I will occasionally use these terms as well, but \"baheret\" will usually be translated as white spot.  This will, I hope, increase our familiarity with the Hebrew original as well.",
            "Let me just give a brief intro to how the \"nega\" process works. A nega is a white spot found on a person's skin. In order for the nega to be impure it must have one of three signs: 1) white hairs; 2) quick flesh, which means that there is some live flesh within the nega; 3) the spreading of the nega. If the nega doesn't have one of these signs, the person is isolated for a week. If after the first week he still doesn't have one of these signs he is isolated again. If after two weeks he doesn't have one of the signs, he is pronounced pure. If he is declared impure at any time, he must burn his clothes and he is sent away from the camp.  ",
            "The mishnah also talks about other skin problems, namely the boil (shekhin) and the burn (mikhvah). It also discusses negaim that occur on the head or beard, for they have their own rules and regulations.  ",
            "For the rabbis, since there are so many verses in the Torah on the topic, it is one that will quite obviously occupy them (and there are fourteen chapters in this tractate). What I am trying to say (in a bit of a roundabout manner) is that even if negaim (scale disease) was not familiar to them, and was of no practical concern, it is \"real\" to them because the Torah pays so much attention to it.  Chapter 13 1 The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: 2 When a person has on the skin of his body a swelling, a rash, or a discoloration, and it develops into a scaly affection on the skin of his body, it shall be reported to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests. 3 The priest shall examine the affection on the skin of his body: if hair in the affected patch has turned white and the affection appears to be deeper than the skin of his body, it is a leprous affection; when the priest sees it, he shall pronounce him unclean. 4 But if it is a white discoloration on the skin of his body which does not appear to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the affected person for seven days. 5 On the seventh day the priest shall examine him, and if the affection has remained unchanged in color and the disease has not spread on the skin, the priest shall isolate him for another seven days. 6 On the seventh day the priest shall examine him again: if the affection has faded and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a rash; he shall wash his clothes, and he shall be clean. 7 But if the rash should spread on the skin after he has presented himself to the priest and been pronounced clean, he shall present himself again to the priest. 8 And if the priest sees that the rash has spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.  9 When a person has a scaly affection, it shall be reported to the priest. 10 If the priest finds on the skin a white swelling which has turned some hair white, with a patch of undiscolored flesh in the swelling, 11 it is chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he need not isolate him, for he is unclean. 12 If the eruption spreads out over the skin so that it covers all the skin of the affected person from head to foot, wherever the priest can see — 13 if the priest sees that the eruption has covered the whole body — he shall pronounce the affected person clean; he is clean, for he has turned all white. 14 But as soon as undiscolored flesh appears in it, he shall be unclean; 15 when the priest sees the undiscolored flesh, he shall pronounce him unclean. The undiscolored flesh is unclean; it is leprosy. 16 But if the undiscolored flesh again turns white, he shall come to the priest, 17 and the priest shall examine him: if the affection has turned white, the priest shall pronounce the affected person clean; he is clean.  18 When an inflammation appears on the skin of one's body and it heals, 19 and a white swelling or a white discoloration streaked with red develops where the inflammation was, he shall present himself to the priest. 20 If the priest finds that it appears lower than the rest of the skin and that the hair in it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous affection that has broken out in the inflammation. 21 But if the priest finds that there is no white hair in it and it is not lower than the rest of the skin, and it is faded, the priest shall isolate him for seven days. 22 If it should spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is an affection. 23 But if the discoloration remains stationary, not having spread, it is the scar of the inflammation; the priest shall pronounce him clean.  24 When the skin of one's body sustains a burn by fire, and the patch from the burn is a discoloration, either white streaked with red, or white, 25 the priest shall examine it. If some hair has turned white in the discoloration, which itself appears to go deeper than the skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the burn. The priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous affection. 26 But if the priest finds that there is no white hair in the discoloration, and that it is not lower than the rest of the skin, and it is faded, the priest shall isolate him for seven days. 27 On the seventh day the priest shall examine him: if it has spread in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a leprous affection. 28 But if the discoloration has remained stationary, not having spread on the skin, and it is faded, it is the swelling from the burn. The priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar of the burn.  29 If a man or a woman has an affection on the head or in the beard, 30 the priest shall examine the affection. If it appears to go deeper than the skin and there is thin yellow hair in it, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scall, a scaly eruption in the hair or beard. 31 But if the priest finds that the scall affection does not appear to go deeper than the skin, yet there is no black hair in it, the priest shall isolate the person with the scall affection for seven days. 32 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the affection. If the scall has not spread and no yellow hair has appeared in it, and the scall does not appear to go deeper than the skin, 33 the person with the scall shall shave himself, but without shaving the scall; the priest shall isolate him for another seven days. 34 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scall. If the scall has not spread on the skin, and does not appear to go deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; he shall wash his clothes, and he shall be clean. 35 If, however, the scall should spread on the skin after he has been pronounced clean, 36 the priest shall examine him. If the scall has spread on the skin, the priest need not look for yellow hair: he is unclean. 37 But if the scall has remained unchanged in color, and black hair has grown in it, the scall is healed; he is clean. The priest shall pronounce him clean.  38 If a man or a woman has the skin of the body streaked with white discolorations, 39 and the priest sees that the discolorations on the skin of the body are of a dull white, it is a tetter broken out on the skin; he is clean.  40 If a man loses the hair of his head and becomes bald, he is clean. 41 If he loses the hair on the front part of his head and becomes bald at the forehead, he is clean. 42 But if a white affection streaked with red appears on the bald part in the front or at the back of the head, it is a scaly eruption that is spreading over the bald part in the front or at the back of the head. 43 The priest shall examine him: if the swollen affection on the bald part in the front or at the back of his head is white streaked with red, like the leprosy of body skin in appearance, 44 the man is leprous; he is unclean. The priest shall pronounce him unclean; he has the affection on his head.  45 As for the person with a leprous affection, his clothes shall be rent, his head shall be left bare, and he shall cover over his upper lip; and he shall call out, \"Unclean! Unclean!\" 46 He shall be unclean as long as the disease is on him. Being unclean, he shall dwell apart; his dwelling shall be outside the camp.  47 When an eruptive affection occurs in a cloth of wool or linen fabric, 48 in the warp or in the woof of the linen or the wool, or in a skin or in anything made of skin; 49 if the affection in the cloth or the skin, in the warp or the woof, or in any article of skin, is streaky green or red, it is an eruptive affection. It shall be shown to the priest; 50 and the priest, after examining the affection, shall isolate the affected article for seven days. 51 On the seventh day he shall examine the affection: if the affection has spread in the cloth — whether in the warp or the woof, or in the skin, for whatever purpose the skin may be used — the affection is a malignant eruption; it is unclean. 52 The cloth — whether warp or woof in wool or linen, or any article of skin — in which the affection is found, shall be burned, for it is a malignant eruption; it shall be consumed in fire. 53 But if the priest sees that the affection in the cloth — whether in warp or in woof, or in any article of skin — has not spread, 54 the priest shall order the affected article washed, and he shall isolate it for another seven days. 55 And if, after the affected article has been washed, the priest sees that the affection has not changed color and that it has not spread, it is unclean. It shall be consumed in fire; it is a fret, whether on its inner side or on its outer side. 56 But if the priest sees that the affected part, after it has been washed, is faded, he shall tear it out from the cloth or skin, whether in the warp or in the woof; 57 and if it occurs again in the cloth — whether in warp or in woof — or in any article of skin, it is a wild growth; the affected article shall be consumed in fire. 58 If, however, the affection disappears from the cloth — warp or woof — or from any article of skin that has been washed, it shall be washed again, and it shall be clean.  59 Such is the procedure for eruptive affections of cloth, woolen or linen, in warp or in woof, or of any article of skin, for pronouncing it clean or unclean.

Here it means that there are two types of negaim mentioned in the Torah baheret and se'et. Both of these have arch-categories and derived categories. The rabbis say that the \"derived categories\" are the \"sapachat\" referred to in Leviticus 13:2. \"Sapach\" can mean \"appended to\" these signs are \"appended to the main signs.",

The notion that these plagues were white like snow comes from Exodus 4:6, where Moses is afflicted with leprosy that is white as snow. Similarly, Miriam (Numbers 12:10) and Gehazi (II Kings 5:27) are afflicted with leprosy that is white as snow. Secondary to it is an affliction that is as white as the lime plaster found on the foundations of the Temple (see Middot 3:4).",

But the sages say: the rising (se' is white wool and secondary to it is like the white of the skin of an egg.</b>  According to Rabbi Meir, se'et is like the white of the peel of an egg, and secondary to it is bleached wool. The Talmud explains that this is the white of the wool of a newborn lamb. The other sages reverse which is the main type of nega and which is secondary."

If the red is found in such a nega, it must be the color of wine mixed with snow. But if it is found in the duller white spot, the one that is the color of the lime plaster in the Temple, it must be like the color of blood mixed with milk, which I would assume is brighter.",

If the nega doesn't get worse, then he is not impure, and if it gets worse then he is declared as having a nega. Here are the relevant verses: 4 But if it is a white discoloration on the skin of his body which does not appear to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the affected person for seven days. 5 On the seventh day the priest shall examine him, and if the affection has remained unchanged in color and the disease has not spread on the skin, the priest shall isolate him for another seven days. Our mishnah teaches that if a person has nega of one color at the beginning of this process and is then \"isolated\" for a week and then is re-examined and the nega is one of the other colors then he is isolated for a second week. We don’t consider it to be a new nega which would make the process start all over again.",

The same problem will occur if one examines the nega on Monday. The end of the first week will be on Sunday, and Sunday will count as both the end of the first week and the first day of the next week. Therefore, the end of the second week will fall on Shabbat.

However, he disagrees as to whether this means that we need to adjust the original exam. Rabbi Akiva prefers to conduct the original exam on the day upon which the person/house is brought to the attention of the priest. If the seventh day falls on Shabbat, we simply delay the examination until after Shabbat. Sometimes this will lead to a leniency and sometimes to a stringency.

There he claimed that sometimes delaying the examination of a nega can lead to a leniency. Our mishnah explains when this is so. The mishnah goes over numerous (and I'm not exaggerating) cases in which a nega would be declared impure had it been seen on Shabbat, but then changes to something that is not impure. Therefore, not seeing a nega Shabbat caused a leniency.\nWhat we now need to do is explain all of these scenarios.",

By the next day, there is only one white hair. If this was the end of the first week, the priest would isolate him for a second week and as long as the appearance stays the same, at the end of the second week he would be pure. Note that had the priest declared him impure, he would have had to bring a sacrifice and shaved the hair of his body. The mishnah now brings up various other scenarios in which on Shabbat there is a nega that would make him impure but then something happens to one of the hairs such that they are now no longer sufficient to make him impure. Only white hairs are impure and the hairs must be of sufficient length.",

If they are in a boil they are not a sign of impurity. If they were in some type of discoloration on Shabbat and then they were either adjoined by a boil or surrounded by a boil, they are pure. The final piece here is a parenthetical remark regarding the boil mentioned above. Such a boil can either be a boil, the quick flesh of a boil, a burn or the quick flesh of a burn, or \"white scurf.\" Now if you don’t know what \"white scurf\" is don't worry.

This would mean that he will be declared pure, even though he should not be. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a dull spot, which should not be impure, will look bright on an Ethiopian's skin. This will cause him to be isolated and then, if it remains, to be declared impure. The question is how do we deal with this situation?",

I suppose that this implies that a woman would only uncover part of her breasts in order to nurse.

And if the white hairs come before the bright spot, he is pure. If it is doubtful [what is the law]? And it was decided that Rabbah bar Nahmani should decide the case, for Rabbah bar Nahmani used to say that he was the only one who knew the law of Negaim and the only one who knew the law of Ohalot. They sent a messenger for him and the angel of death could not touch him, for he did not stop studying for one moment. In the meantime a wind blew and made noise with the trees of the forest, and Rabbah thought that a legion of soldiers was after him and he said: It is better for me to die through the angel of death than to be taken by the Government. When he was dying, he said \"he is pure, he is pure.\" Then a heavenly voice came forth, saying: Happy are you, Rabbah bar Nahmani, for your body is pure, and your soul left you body while you were saying \"pure.\" There are many interesting things about this story, but one of the tidbits I really find interesting is that only Rabbah bar Nahmani knew the laws of Ohalot and Negaim well enough to make decisions on these matters.

Once the quick flesh is smaller than a lentil, it is no longer a sign of impurity. However, if the quick flesh was larger than a lentil but then the inner nega (the bright spot) spread into it but the quick flesh remained at least the size of a lentil, the inside nega is impure.

The outer nega is also impure because the quick flesh is large enough to be a sign of impurity.

White scurf need not be the size of a lentil. If the inner nega spreads into the white scurf it is considered to have spread because white scurf is not a nega (it is not a sign of impurity, see 1:5), rather it is flesh. Thus even Rabbi Akiva would agree that the inner nega is impure.

The following are the relevant verses from Leviticus 13 that deal with the scall.\n29 If a man or a woman has an affection on the head or in the beard, 30 the priest shall examine the affection. If it appears to go deeper than the skin and there is thin yellow hair in it, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scall, a scaly eruption in the hair or beard. 31 But if the priest finds that the scall affection does not appear to go deeper than the skin, yet there is no black hair in it, the priest shall isolate the person with the scall affection for seven days. 32 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the affection. If the scall has not spread and no yellow hair has appeared in it, and the scall does not appear to go deeper than the skin, 33 the person with the scall shall shave himself, but without shaving the scall; the priest shall isolate him for another seven days. 34 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scall. If the scall has not spread on the skin, and does not appear to go deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; he shall wash his clothes, and he shall be clean. 35 If, however, the scall should spread on the skin after he has been pronounced clean, 36 the priest shall examine him.

When it comes to the white hairs that are a sign of impurity in a regular nega, one that appears on the body, they cause uncleanness only if they appear after the nega. For these hairs the rule is more stringent no other hair will \"afford protection\" for them. This means that if black hairs are also there, the nega is still impure, as long as there are at least two white hairs. The rule with regard to yellow hairs is more lenient other hairs of other colors \"afford protection\" such that if there are two yellow hairs and two black hairs, the nega is pure.

Rabbi Eliezer gives Rabbi Judah permission to answer his question, but only if his answer supports the halakhah found in section one. Rabbi Judah ben Batera says that the garment is impure not because of the spreading to the colored stripe but rather because the whole garment could be impure if the nega stays on the white stripe for two weeks. When the sages said \"it effectively spread from one to the other\" they did not mean literally that it can spread. Rather, it spreads in the sense that if the white stripe is impure because the nega remained there for two weeks, the whole garment becomes impure, even the colored stripes.

Rabbi Shimon says that there is no real reason to clear out bundles of wood and reeds from the house since they can't become impure. The purpose is not to protect their purity. Rather it is to keep the owner busy clearing out his house, for perhaps the nega will disappear while he is in the process of doing so.

If it is anything made of wood, cloth or metal, even if it becomes impure, it can be cleansed by immersion in a mikveh. So what exactly is it that the Torah is protecting? The answer is that it is protecting earthenware vessels, which are the cheapest, most dispensable type of vessels. Now, if the Torah goes so far out of its way to protect such small, not particularly valuable items, all the more so the Torah is concerned with protecting a person from larger financial loss. And if the Torah is concerned with financial loss, all the more so it is concerned with the loss of life, which is obviously much more valuable.

That is why the verse says \"into the palm of the priest's left hand.\" The Torah would not repeat the word \"priest\" if it didn't mean another priest.

The live metzora also can't simply bring new sacrifices because the sacrifice that was already offered may have been his own. In such a case, were he to bring a new sacrifice it would count as bringing non-sacred animals into the Temple Court, which is prohibited. The men of Alexandria asked Rabbi Joshua what to do in this situation.",

Now he can bring a new sin-offering, because he is a new person and he can bring a new offering.

As I always write, it is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. For me learning Negaim helped sort out those chapters in Leviticus that I've never understood all that well. What has fascinated me about Negaim is how much attention the rabbis pay to a subject that was not only not observed in their own time (this is true for large portions of Kodashim and Toharot) but may not have even been observed during the entire Second Temple period. The entire tractate did not contain even one historical memory of a person who actually had a nega. This just goes to show us that the rabbis main topic of interest is Torah and if something is covered extensively in the Torah, they will pay great attention to it, even if it had no practical implications upon their lives. Tomorrow our learning continues with Tractate Parah. Good luck to everyone and congratulations on your amazing commitment to learning."
