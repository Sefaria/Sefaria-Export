            "Today most people are familiar with the \"mikveh\" usually translated as a \"ritual bath.\" In modern halakhah it is mostly used for conversion and by women immersing after their menstrual period. Some men also have a custom of going to the mikveh but that is more as a custom. ",
            "Most people are not all that familiar with the laws of the mikveh which can be quite complicated. This is the topic of our tractate—what exactly constitutes a mikveh and who needs to immerse in a mikveh in order to become pure. ",
            "The Torah states that a zav, a person who has had an abnormal genital discharge must  \"bathe his body in fresh water; then he shall be clean\" (Leviticus 15:13). The \"fresh water\" is understood as a living stream, in Hebrew a \"maayan.\" In contrast, people with other forms of impurity must only \"bathe his whole body in water\" (Leviticus 15:16). This latter requirement is understood to be bathing in a mikveh. We shall talk throughout the tractate about what differentiates a \"mikveh\" from a \"maayan\" a living stream, how large a mikveh must be, and how the water must get into the mikveh. For now, I will merely quote the verses below that refer to what the rabbis call a \"mikveh.\" We shall reference these as we continue to learn.  Good luck with learning Mikvaot!",
            "Leviticus 11 31 Those are for you the unclean among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening. 32 And anything on which one of them falls when dead shall be unclean: be it any article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack — any such article that can be put to use shall be dipped in water, and it shall remain unclean until evening; then it shall be clean.",
            "Leviticus 15 13 When one with a discharge becomes clean of his discharge, he shall count off seven days for his cleansing, wash his clothes, and bathe his body in fresh water; then he shall be clean…16 When a man has an emission of semen, he shall bathe his whole body in water and remain unclean until evening. ",
            "Numbers 31 22\"This is the ritual law that the Lord has enjoined upon Moses: 22 Gold and silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead 23 — any article that can withstand fire — these you shall pass through fire and they shall be clean, except that they must be cleansed with water of lustration; and anything that cannot withstand fire you must pass through water. "

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nMikvaot begins with a list of \"six degrees\" of the purity of mikvaot. [We should note that many tractates begin with numbers. For instance, Shabbat, Shevuot, Kiddushin, Ohalot, etc. It seems that the tannaim liked starting mishnayot in this way].\n\"Mikveh\" here refers to any water gathered in the ground.\nOur mishnah deals with laws concerning water gathered in pools that don't have forty seah in them. This shall be the topic of the first five mishnayot of the chapter.",
                    "<b>There are six degrees of mikvaot, each superior to the other.</b>  This is the introduction to the entire first chapter.",
                    "<b>The water of pools [smaller than 40 seah]    if an unclean person drank of it and then a clean person drank of it, he becomes unclean;</b>  If an unclean person came and drank from a pool of water, and then a clean person came and drank from the same water, the clean person becomes unclean. This is because it is possible that the clean person drank from the exact water that the unclean person touched. Although water that is still \"connected to the ground\" by virtue of it being in a pool cannot become impure (see Leviticus 11:36) the mishnah considers the water that was removed from the pool and then put back in by the unclean person to be separate from the other water. This already-defiled water does not mix back in with the pool and become nullified. When the clean person removes some water, this water is now detached from the ground and since there will be some of the unclean water with it, all of the water is defiled. The water then defiles the clean person by contact.",
                    "<b>If an unclean person drank of it and then drew water from it in a clean vessel, [the vessel] becomes unclean;</b>  Similarly, a clean vessel is defiled by contact with this water. Again, the water inside does not become nullified.",

If the person who took it out first washed his hands off in the water, then he hands are unclean and he will defile the loaf. If, however, he does not first wash his hands off, then the loaf remains clean. The reason is a bit complicated. The water in the pool cannot become impure until it has been removed from the pool. When he removes this water, the clean water is greater in quantity than the unclean water and therefore the unclean water is nullified. In this case, we don't say that the unclean water defiles the clean water, as we said in section two because we hold that the unclean water has been absorbed by the loaf. Since this water cannot be seen, it is considered to be nullified by the clean water. I realize that this is complicated. Just remember I didn't write it."

A mikveh does not purify when its water is trickling on the ground. All forty seahs have to be gathered in one place for it to purify. In contrast, a spring generally purifies even if its water is trickling on the ground. However, in the case in our mishnah since the spring waters have been augmented with drawn water, they don't purify unless they have been gathered together, i.e. they are standing. In this way it is similar to the mikveh. This spring is similar to an ordinary spring, one whose water has not been augmented with drawn water, in that the fresh spring water purifies even if there are less than forty seahs. In contrast, a mikveh, water that has been gathered (we shall learn how in subsequent mishnayot) only purifies if there are forty seahs."

These waters are purer than the spring whose standing waters have been augmented with drawn water because the water of this spring purifies even when the water is flowing on the ground.

This is the level of purity required for the immersion of a zav, a person with an abnormal genital discharge (see Leviticus 15:13). The metzora is a person who had some sort of skin disease (we learned about this in Negaim; see Leviticus 14). This is also the type of water required to make the \"hatat waters\" the waters into which are put the ashes of the red heifer (see Leviticus 19:16; we learned about this in Parah)."

The mishnah gives a couple of examples of this. The first is when a person ate or drank something unclean. The second is concerning drawn water. The rabbis decreed that drawn water defiles if a person immerses his head and most of his body in them or if three log of drawn water falls on him (we shall learn more about this later). In both of these cases, the doubt is deemed pure because the impurity is only derabanan. The second part of this list is a repeat of the list in yesterday's mishnah.

If two or more together poured three logs into the mikveh, it is not invalid. The other sages have a different reading in their older mishnah.

A time period is either a day or a night. Rabbi Ishmael holds that a woman who has discharge on the third day is impure, but one who has discharge on the fourth day is pure. Therefore, sometimes there can be four time periods in which she is impure. For instance if she has relations on late Sunday afternoon, the discharge is impure through Wednesday morning, which is four full time periods (Sunday night, Monday day, Monday night, Tuesday day).

As I always write, it is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Tractate Mikvaot is one of the tractates of Seder Toharot that does have some practical significance in the modern world. Mikvaot are still used in the modern world, by women immersing after the menstrual periods, by those converting to Judaism and by men who have taken upon various immersion customs. I hope that learning the tractate has given you an appreciation of what a mikveh actually is, what disqualifies a mikveh and what disqualifies a valid immersion in a mikveh. As always, a hearty yasher koach upon completing the tractate and keep up the good work. Tomorrow we begin Niddah."
