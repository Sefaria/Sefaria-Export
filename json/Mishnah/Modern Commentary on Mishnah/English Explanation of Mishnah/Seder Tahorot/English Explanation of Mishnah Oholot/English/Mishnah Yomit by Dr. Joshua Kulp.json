            "The word \"Ohalot\" means \"tents\" and it refers to the halakhah found in Numbers 19 (quoted below) according to which a person or vessel found in a tent with a dead body is impure even without direct contact with the body. In other words, the tent causes the defilement of the corpse to spread throughout the tent and defile everything in the tent. The rabbis define \"tent\" in a very broad manner. Basically, any covering that hangs over a corpse (or piece thereof) can convey the impurity to anything else which it overhangs. Basically, the only requirement is that this \"overhanging\" or \"tent\" be at least one handbreadth long, one handbreadth wide and one handbreadth in height. And just as a \"tent\" (I will try to use the term \"ohel\" as well) conveys the impurity to that which is found beneath it, it also prevents the impurity from spreading to that which is above the tent. In other words it conveys and confines at the same time. If a corpse is above the ohel, that which is below the ohel is not defiled. ",
            "Tractate Ohalot also deals with other issues concerning the impurity of a corpse. The Torah specifically states that anyone that has contact with a corpse is impure for seven days. The rabbis add that carrying a corpse also defiles, even without contact. The Torah also states that a person who had contact with a dead body defiles others and vessels, but only for a period of one day. Thus the dead body itself is the \"father of the fathers of impurity\" and the person (or vessel) who had contact with a dead body is a \"father of impurity.\" ",
            "Tractates Ohalot and Negaim, the next tractate, were already famous in the Talmudic period for their difficulty. In a passage which I happened to have just taught a few days ago (Bavli Pesahim 50a) R. Yohanan says that these two tractates are difficult in this world, but will be easier in the world to come. In Bavli Hagigah 14a, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya scolds Rabbi Akiva for dealing in matters of aggadah and tells him to go study Ohalot and Negaim. He chooses these two tractates due to their depth and difficulty.  We are a bit luckier than Rabbi Akiva for we have many commentaries on which to base our study, including a relatively recent modern commentary by Professor Abraham Goldberg (whose son-in-law is a colleague of mine at the Conservative Yeshiva). These laws will be difficult, but perhaps by making them a bit easier than they were at first, we too can have a small taste of the world to come.  Below are the verses most relevant to our tractate.  Good luck!"

A peg is fixed into the ground next to a tent but it is not part of the tent and there is a corpse in the tent. According to Rabbi Akiva, the peg and the tent count as two separate items. The tent overshadows the peg causing it to be impure and Rabbi Akiva counts it like a vessel that overshadows a dead body or touches it. The person who touches the peg is impure and becomes a father of impurity. Any vessels that touch the person are all impure with seven day's impurity. That's four. The person or vessel that touches the aforementioned vessels is impure but only until the evening. The other sages respond that the tent itself does not count. Both the tent and the peg are impure for they are considered to have shadowed over the corpse, and the peg is not impure because of the tent. Therefore, we don't begin the count from the tent, but rather from the peg, in which case there are only four, not five, in this chain."

This includes clothing. This clothing will subsequently defile other people. However, if a zav lays or reclines on a person (without touching that person) that person does not defile other people.

The mishnah lists some consequences (besides his still being pure) for the fact that he still counts as being alive. If his brother died without offspring, the wife is liable for levirate marriage (yibbum) as long as he is alive. If his father died, his father's wife is exempt from yibbum as long as he was alive when his father died. If he is a kohen and his mother is an Israelite who was widowed from his father (also a kohen), his mother eats terumah as long as he is alive (assuming no other offspring).

According to Bet Hillel (at least at first) the pot protects the contents of the upper story from becoming impure.<br>Section two: Bet Shammai holds that the pot only protects things that cannot be purified in a mikveh, such as food, drink or earthenware vessels. Things that can be purified in a mikveh are not protected. The reason for this is a bit complicated and is explained more thoroughly in Eduyot 1:14. Below, to aid in understanding today's mishnah, I have replicated that mishnah in its entirety and I have also replicated my commentary (which I wrote over 8 years ago!). Note that in both mishnayot Bet Hillel changes their opinion and rules like Bet Shammai.<br>According to Numbers 19:15, a clay vessel that is covered with a lid prevents impurity from entering inside of it.  If this vessel is found in a room with a dead body, which would normally cause everything in the room to be impure, the clay vessel and all that is inside of it does not contract the impurity.  Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel argue about what types of things which may be inside the clay vessels are not impure.  According to Beth Hillel any object inside the vessel is pure.  Beth Shammai holds that only food, liquids and other clay vessels remain pure; non-clay vessels would be impure.<br>Beth Shammai explains that we can assume that the clay vessel has been touched by an ignoramus (am haaretz), a person who does not strictly know or observe the laws of ritual purity.  It is assumed that the am haaretz makes the vessel impure.  Since an impure vessel does not prevent the impurity from entering, the things inside of it are impure.<br>Beth Hillel responds to Beth Shammai by pointing out that they did indeed accept that the food and liquids inside the vessel were pure.  If the clay vessel does not prevent impurity from entering, why should anything inside of it remain pure?<br>To this question Beth Shammai responds that when they stated that the food and liquids were pure they meant for the am haaretz himself and not for the haver (a person who scrupulously observes the laws of purity and indeed eats only pure food). Beth Shammai assumes that a haver will not borrow any of these things from an am haaretz, since they cannot be made pure (a clay vessel cannot be cleansed of its impurity).  Therefore Beth Shammai can pronounce these things clean, knowing that they will never come into the hands of a haver.  However, when Beth Hillel pronounced everything inside pure, they were in essence declaring it pure for both the am haaretz and the haver.  Beth Hillel had implied that even metal vessels, inside the clay vessel, remained pure.  A haver might borrow metal vessels from an am haaretz, with the intent of immersing them to cleanse them of their impurities.  However, this immersion will only cleanse them from light impurities and not from impurity contracted from a dead body.  Therefore, a haver might borrow them thinking that he could cleanse them and in reality he could not.  Due to this problem, Beth Hillel retracted their opinion and taught like Beth Shammai."

It causes impurity only if one intended to eat the bird and it was rendered susceptible to impurity by coming into contact with water after it died.

This means that if one end overshadows a source of corpse impurity and the other end overshadows vessels, it conveys impurity from the corpse to the vessels. An ox-goad has a circumference of one handbreadth, but it does not have a width of one handbreadth. This is stated directly in Kelim 17:8.",

For a farmer was passing by and over his shoulder was an ox-goad, and one end overshadowed a grave. He was declared unclean on account of vessels that were overshadowing a corpse.</b>  Rabbi Tarfon bitterly objects to this halakhah, claiming that it is the result of a misunderstood story. A person heard that someone carrying an ox-goad which overshadows a dead body conveys impurity to the person carrying it, but he didn't properly understand the reason. The story goes as follows. A farmer was carrying an ox-goad and one end of the ox-goad overshadowed a grave. When he came in front of some sages, they declared him impure. However, this is not because a vessel that is less than a handbreadth conveys impurity to another vessel that it overshadows. Rather, the ox-goad itself was made impure by overshadowing a corpse. For this to happen, the ox-goad does not need to be a handbreadth. The farmer touched the ox-goad and was defiled because a vessel that has corpse impurity defiles a person (see 1:3). The person who heard that the farmer was impure thought that it was because the ox-goad overshadowed the person and therefore he said that a vessel need only be as thick as an ox-goad to convey impurity.",

He wishes to preserve the accuracy of the statement transmitted in section one, without changing the halakhah that for a vessel to convey uncleanness it must be a handbreadth wide. He now proceeds to outline three halakhot. If someone is carrying a vessel that is as thick as an ox-goad (less than a handbreadth) and the vessel overshadows a corpse, even though the person didn't actually touch the vessel and it only touched his clothes, and the person should only be impure until the evening as is the rule when a person touches a vessel that touched another vessel that had contact with a corpse (see 1:2), nevertheless the sages declared that such a person is impure for seven days due to the uncleanness of an ohel. In other words, Rabbi Akiva says that when the rabbis stated the halakhah in section one, it was a stringency related only to that situation. When it comes to the impurity of the vessel itself, a vessel that overshadows a corpse is impure even if it is less than a handbreadth in width. Finally, for the vessel to convey uncleanness from the source of corpse impurity to other vessels it overshadows, it must be at least a handbreadth in width. This shows clearly that there is no debate between him and Rabbi Tarfon."

Judah says: Near means there is none nearer than it, and old means that no one remembers [when it was made].</b>  This section deals with mounds that are found outside a city. It seems that women would bury their miscarried fetuses in these mounds, and lepers would bury their lost limbs. These fetuses and limbs are impure and therefore the mounds, under certain circumstances, must be treated as impure. The impurity of the mound depends on two factors: its proximity to the city and its age. The closer it is to the city, the more likely it is that people buried fetuses or limbs there. And the older it is, the more likely that people forgot whether or not anything was buried there. A mound that is close to the city whether or not it is old is impure; but if it is far from the city it is impure only if it is old. Rabbi Meir provides objective numbers for \"near\" and \"old.\" For a mound to be near, it must be within fifty cubits. And for it to be \"old\" it must be sixty years old, which probably is the upper end of how long a person might live during that period. Rabbi Judah provides relative numbers. A mound is close if it is the closest mound to the city, for people will be likely to bury their fetuses and limbs there. So if there is one mound that is 25 cubits away and another that is 35, only the one 25 cubits away is impure. Likewise, if the closest mound is 100 cubits away, it is impure.

The first step is to purify the person harvesting and his vessels. Seven days before the harvesting he goes through the purification process of having hatat water (those containing the ashes of the red heifer) sprinkled upon him on the third and seventh day. Generally this is done only for someone who has corpse impurity, but here it is done even if the person does not actually have corpse impurity. The point of the procedure is to demonstrate that the impurity of the bet peras is being taken with grave consideration (pun intended). After this, the person harvests the grapes and brings them out of the bet peras. It would seem that the grapes should be defiled by the person and the vessels for these are defiled once they are in the bet peras. However, since there is no other way to get the grapes out of the field, the rabbis didn't declare that they would impure. In other words, since the impurity of the bet peras is of rabbinic origin (and not from the Torah), the rabbis have room to dispense with this impurity when they feel the situation requires. The harvesters then give the grapes to pure people who had not gone into the field. Those who have received the grapes can take them to the winepress and press the grapes while they are pure. The harvesters should not because it is possible to pass the grapes on to people that were not in a winepress.

Alternatively, he harvests using stone, which is never susceptible to impurity. He then lets the grapes fall into a type of basket that cannot become impure.

His only option in this case would be to sell the grapes in the marketplace. These grapes have not become susceptible to impurity since they weren't harvested to be crushed."

Each of these different types of fields has different rules which govern it.<br>Section two: Plants such as trees can be planted in a field in which a grave was plowed because harvesting the fruit of these trees won't uproot the earth. In yesterday's mishnah we learned that Rabbi Yose forbade planting a vineyard, but the other sages seem to allow any type of plant to be planted.<br>Section three: It is permitted to sow seeds which yield produce that is reaped, meaning cut down.<br>Section four: However, it is problematic to plant seeds which yield produce that is plucked, meaning torn out of the ground. The fear is that a bone will get stuck to the bottom of the plant and the harvester will bring it into his house and thereby transmit impurity to other places. To remedy this problem he must pile up the produce in the field itself and not bring it to other places. In the field, Rabbi Meir says he must sift through the produce twice to clean off the dirt and any bones. The other sages say he needs to sift pulse (legumes) three times because more dirt is mixed in with it.<br>Section six: He must burn the stubble and stalks while they are still in the field, again because we are afraid that there is some bone mixed in with them.<br>Section seven: The field and pieces of dirt from the field convey impurity if one comes into contact with them or if one carries them. But the dirt of the field cannot cause impurity by overshadowing (an ohel) because a bone the size of a lentil does not transmit impurity by overshadowing."

Such a field may be planted with seed even if the produce will be plucked. We are not concerned lest a piece of bone get stuck to a plant when it is uprooted and that he will bring it into his home (as we were concerned in yesterday's mishnah) because in such a field the bones were not spread around by plowing. The roots of these types of plants will not reach down to where the body was buried, and therefore there is no concern that when they are uprooted, bones will be uprooted as well. However, one cannot plant trees there because their roots do reach down to the grave. It is even forbidden to leave fruit trees there because their roots receive nourishment from the grave. The only type of tree that can be left there is a tree that is meant just for shade and does not yield fruit.",

According to this reading, this type of field was on the way to the cemetery and people would stop there, put the biers down and wail over the dead. The fear is that a limb of the body might have fallen out onto the field (oops, there goes an arm!). The other interpretation (supported by the Tosefta) is based on the word \"kokhin\". The Tosefta asks: \"What is a kokhin field? Any field in which they dig in the ground and moved kokhin to the sides.\" Kokhin are burial niches. So a kokhin field is one in which the burial niches were moved to the sides of the fields. The fear is that they missed one of the kokhin. According to the first explanation, one cannot plant or sow seeds in such a field because the field was designated to be used as a \"mourner's field.\" According to the second explanation, even though the kokhin were removed, it retains the status of a burial ground and therefore it cannot be used for planting or sowing seed. However, earth taken out of the field is considered pure. The earth in the field is only impure because of a doubt, whether there was a grave there. Therefore the sages decreed that one who entered the field is impure. But they didn't decree that earth taken out of the field should be impure. Therefore, one can take earth out of the bet peras and use it to make a pure oven.",

If such a bone is found, he will be declared impure and he won't be allowed to offer the sacrifice, but if not, he can go on his merry way to Jerusalem. They also agree that the field is not checked if all that the person wants to do is eat terumah. The difference between the pesah sacrifice and the terumah seems to be that the sacrificing and eating the pesah on Pesah is a mitzvah and therefore they should do anything possible to allow him to do so. In contrast, eating terumah is not a mitzvah, it's just allowed to the kohanim. If he doesn't eat terumah, he can eat regular produce.",

According to Bet Shammai they do check the field on his behalf and if no bone is found, the Nazirite remains pure. Bet Hillel says that they do not check the field.

It is possible to remove 1.5 handbreadths of topsoil and then add 1.5 handbreadths of new topsoil. Note that in reality, when he plows he will plow into the old topsoil because the plow goes to a depth of three handbreadths. In other words, Rabbi Shimon's rule is basically a legal fiction.

In the case of the stones, since the stones cannot be moved, he won't move anything that is underneath.
