            "The word \"tevul yom\" refers to a person who has immersed in a mikveh but will not become pure until the evening. The concept is derived by the rabbis from the following two verses:",
            "Leviticus 11:32 And anything on which one of them falls when dead shall be unclean: be it any article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack — any such article that can be put to use shall be dipped in water, and it shall remain unclean until evening; then it shall be clean. ",
            "Leviticus 22:6-7 6 The person who touches such shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the sacred donations unless he has washed his body in water. 7 As soon as the sun sets, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the sacred donations, for they are his food. 8 He shall not eat anything that died or was torn by beasts, thereby becoming unclean: I am the Lord. ",
            "According to rabbinic law, a kohen goes to the mikveh before the sun sets but cannot eat terumah until after the sun has set. This is the meaning of Leviticus 22:7. So too a vessel which has become impure through a sheretz (a creepy crawly thing) is immersed in a mikveh and then can be used with terumah in the evening, when the sun has set. Until the sun has set, both the person and the vessel are called a \"tevul yom.\"",
            "A \"tevul yom\" is not actually impure. Once he or the vessel has been in the mikveh, he or the vessel is pure. If a tevul yom touches terumah he disqualifies the terumah from being eaten, but it is not impure. Indeed, there is a special leniency with terumah that has been disqualified because it was touched by a tevul yom. Generally, disqualified terumah will disqualify sacred food it touches. But in this case, the terumah does not disqualify sacred food.",
            "This tractate is highly technical, dealing with the nitty-gritties of impurity law. But by now, those of you who have been following along are real experts in these laws, so it shouldn't be difficult at all ☺. "

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe first mishnah in Tevul Yom deals with the issue of whether things that are loosely connected to each other are considered to be one thing, such that if a tevul yom touches one side the whole thing is impure, or many independent things, such that the other side is pure. The issue of \"connectives\" is something we saw several other times in the Mishnah, including chapters 18-21 of Kelim.",
                    "<b>If one had collected hallah  [portions] with the intention of keeping them separate, but in the meantime they had become stuck together: Bet Shammai say: they are connected in the case of a tevul yom. But Bet Hillel say: they are not connected.</b>  A priest collects pieces of hallah that he has been given by other people. He intends to keep them separate and bake them separately. However, they end up getting stuck together. According to Bet Shammai, since they are stuck together, if one of them is touched by a tevul yom, then they are all impure. Bet Shammai looks at the situation purely by what is going on physically. Since the pieces of hallah are touching each other, they count as one piece of dough. If the tevul yom touches one of them, they are all disqualified. Bet Hillel, in contrast, takes the person's intention into account. Since he intended to bake them separately, the fact that they temporarily made contact with each other does not mean they count as being connected. Only the piece that the tevul yom actually touched is impure.",
                    "<b>Pieces of dough [of terumah]  that had become stuck together, Or loaves  that had become joined, or one who bakes a batter-cake on top of another batter-cake before it could form a crust in the oven, or the froth  on the water that was bubbling, or the first scum  that rises when boiling groats of beans, or the scum of new wine (r. Judah says: also that of: Bet Shammai say: they are connected  in the case of a tevul yom. But Bet Hillel say: they are not connected.</b>  In all of the cases described here there are two or more things that could be looked at as connected or not. In all of these cases, the substance is of terumah and the question is if part was touched by the tevul yom, is it all impure? Some of these require a bit more explanation: Or one who bakes a batter-cake on top of another batter-cake before it could form a crust in the oven: This person will definitely separate the cakes because they will form a crust better when they are separate. Or if there was froth on the water that was bubbling: This refers to a case of a watery dish which is boiling and has bubbles rising from it. Since the dish is watery, the bubbles don't count as being attached to the dish, at least according to Bet Hillel. Or the first froth that rises when boiling groats of beans: the beans were crushed and made into groats. When they are boiled for the first time, a froth comes up. Rabbi Judah says: also that of rice: Boiled terumah rice. In all of these cases Bet Shammai says that all of the parts are considered to be connected. If a tevul yom touches one part, for instance the froth, the whole thing is disqualified. Bet Hillel says that they are considered separate and therefore the part that wasn't touched remains valid terumah.",
                    "<b>They agree [that they serve as connectives] if they come into contact with other kinds of uncleanness, whether they be of minor or major grades.</b>  The disagreement between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel is with regard to the tevul yom. As I stated in the introduction, the rabbis (at least Bet Hillel) treated a tevul yom somewhat leniently, since he had already been to the mikveh. However, when it comes to other forms of impurity, both serious and lenient forms, all of the things listed in this mishnah are considered to be connected. Bet Hillel was lenient only with regard to the tevul yom."

A \"lupine\" is a type of bean. One would not generally eat a lupine stuck onto his loaf of bread. If the piece of burnt crust is too big, he wouldn't eat that either. He wouldn't eat a pebble or a big lump of salt.

If the loaf is terumah, and a tevul yom or a person with another type of impurity touches them but not the loaf, the loaf remains pure. In other words, these things won't be eaten with the loaf so they are not part of the loaf. I admit that I don't know what some of these things are. But from what we can learn from this mishnah, they are not food commonly consumed. The other sages are lenient when it comes to a tevul yom, for he is not truly impure.

These foods will be eaten with the loaf. Therefore if even a tevul yom touches them, the rest of the loaf is defiled.

They are like liquids that he touches and a tevul yom does not defile liquid such in order to give it first degree impurity.

So a tevul yom who touches liquid in a pot, the liquids themselves are disqualified (if they are terumah), but they don't have the power to defile the pot.

In the above matter defiled hands were treated more stringently than the tevul yom. However, there is another halakhah in which tevul yom is treated more stringently than defiled hands. Any case of doubt regarding the tevul yom is treated stringently. For instance, if we are not sure if a tevul yom touched something of terumah, the terumah cannot be eaten.

The first version should read thusly: But with all other mashed foods which were mashed with liquids or those which are usually mashed with liquids and yet were mashed without liquids, though they formed one cohesive mass in the pot, are regarded as a cake of preserved figs. The explanation is that if there was a food that people don't usually mash up with liquids but he nevertheless did mash it up with liquid or if there was a food which is normally mashed up with liquids but he didn't mash it up with liquids, even if they form one cohesive lump in the pot, they are treated like a cake of preserved figs.

But those which are usually mashed with liquids and yet were mashed without liquids, though they formed one cohesive mass in the pot, are regarded as a cake of preserved figs. The explanation is that other mashed foods that he mashed with liquids are also treated like garlic mashed with oil. If they make a cohesive mass, they are treated as connected.

Later, they expanded the category to include one leaving for a sea voyage or a caravan journey.  These men would have wanted to write out a get that would go into effect should they not return, not an unlikely scenario.  This would prevent their wives from being left as “agunot” a woman who doesn’t know if her husband is alive or dead and therefore cannot remarry.

This man may want to divorce his wife in order to exempt her from levirate marriage (if he was to do childless and with a brother she would have to undergo yibbum or halitzah).

We can see here his deference to tradition, and yet his striving to understand it, and his sense of frustration when he cannot. This is an attitude that I believe is very typical among rabbis.

A person, after all, would only benefit from making such a statement. Congratulations! We have completed Tractate Tevul Yom! As I always write, it is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. One thing that you might have been wonder about while studying this tractate was what made the sages so interested in this category. Of course you probably know by the now that the answer will not be practical i.e. this was a commonly occurring issue. Rather, I think this is another example of the sort of topic that really interested the rabbis in-between or marginal cases. The tevul yom is sort of pure, for s/he has already been to the mikveh. But s/he is also impure because the sun hasn't set. This type of category seems to have immensely interested the sages, and although we tend to prefer to see practical ramifications for everything the rabbis said, the truth is that much of rabbinic literature, and especially the Mishnah, is interested in the theoretical and not the practical. As always, a hearty yasher koach upon completing the tractate and keep up the good work. Tomorrow we begin Yadayim."
