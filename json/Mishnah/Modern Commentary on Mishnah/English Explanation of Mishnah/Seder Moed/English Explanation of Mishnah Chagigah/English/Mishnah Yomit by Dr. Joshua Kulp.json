            "Tractate Hagigah deals with the three sacrifices that according to the rabbis a person had to bring on all three festivals, Sukkot, Pesah and Shavuot.  ",
            "The first of these sacrifices is called the “Hagigah.”  The rabbis derived the concept of the Hagigah from the word “hag” used in the context of the three festivals.  According to the rabbis, every person had to bring on the first day of the festival a Hagigah.  If they could not offer it on the first day, then they could bring it for the remaining seven days. The Hagigah is a type of thanksgiving sacrifice; some of the meat went to the owners and some of the fats were offered on the altar.",
            "The second type of sacrifice is a celebratory thanksgiving offering. This is meant to fulfill the commandment to celebrate on the festival (Deuteronomy 16:14).   Celebrating means eating meat (sorry if you’re a vegetarian).  People were supposed to eat these thanksgiving offerings for all seven days.    ",
            "The third sacrifice is called a “re’eyah” which means “to be seen.”  Deuteronomy 16:16 says that all males must “be seen” at the Temple three times a year, on the three festivals.  The rabbis understood that they were not to be seen empty-handed, but rather they had to bring a sacrifice.  This sacrifice is a whole burnt offering, an olah.   ",
            "Tractate Hagigah deals mostly with these three sacrifices.  Along the way there are some fascinating mishnayot that deal with sacrifices and purity and shed much light on certain historical aspects of the Second Temple and Mishnaic periods.  While some of these mishnayot may be a little difficult to understand, those who persist in learning them will find them quite intriguing.   \n"

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nOur mishnah delineates who is obligated to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem on the three festivals.  Exodus 23:17 says, “Three times a year all your male shall appear before the Sovereign, the Lord.”  Our mishnah elaborates on this verse.",
                    "<b>All are obligated to appear [at the Temple], except a deaf person,  an imbecile and a minor, a person of unknown sex [tumtum], a hermaphrodite, women, unfreed slaves, a lame person, a blind person, a sick person, an aged person, and one who is unable to go up on foot.</b>  I will explain each category of persons exempted from making the pilgrimage one at a time. A deaf person, an imbecile and a minor: These three people are usually lumped together because they are not considered to have “awareness/intelligence” (daat).  They are exempt from all commandments, this one included. A person of unknown sex [tumtum], a hermaphrodite, women:  Exodus 23:17 says that only males are obligated.  The mishnah therefore exempts anyone whose sex as a male is not certain.  A tumtum is a person with neither male nor female genitalia.  A hermaphrodite has both.  Since neither is a certain male, neither is obligated. Unfreed slaves:  Slaves are not obligated for any mitzvah from which a woman is exempt. A lame person, a blind person, a sick person, an aged person, and one who is unable to go up on foot:  Except for the blind person, the other people in this list will have great difficulty in walking up to the Temple Mount.  Since the word for festival is “regel” which also means “leg,” these people are exempt.  The blind person is exempt because the Torah says that the mitzvah is “to be seen” there. Since the blind person cannot see, he does not have to be seen.",
                    "<b>Who is a minor? Whoever is unable to ride on his father’s shoulders and go up from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, the words of Bet Shammai. But Bet Hillel say: whoever is unable to hold his father’s hand and go up from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, as it is said: “Three regalim” (Exodus 23:14).</b>  Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai debate the age at which a minor is obligated to make the pilgrimage.  According to Bet Shammai, as long as the child can ride on his father’s shoulders he must go to the Temple.  Shammai (and his eponymous house) is generally strict when it comes to the observance of commandments by children. For instance, Shammai made a sukkah for his infant son, and he wanted the same son to fast on Yom Kippur.  For Shammai, as long as the child can physically perform the commandment, he must do so. Bet Hillel holds that the child must be able to walk on his own.  This is derived from the fact that the Torah uses the word “regel” which also means leg. The Torah’s choice of this word, as opposed to “Three pa’amim” (three times) implies that the child must be able to walk on his own.  On a perhaps deeper level, Bet Hillel holds that the mitzvah is for the person to go there on his own, through the power of his own body.  Having someone else carry one there is simply not a fulfillment of the mitzvah."

                    "<b>Bet Shammai say: the pilgrimage-offering (re’eyah) must be worth [at least] two pieces of silver and the hagigah one piece (ma’ah) of silver. But Bet Hillel say: the pilgrimage-offering must be worth [at least] one ma'ah of silver and the hagigah two pieces of silver.</b> The pilgrimage offering is an olah, a wholly burnt offering, whereas the hagigah is a shelamim, a thanksgiving offering, part eaten by the priests, part by its owners and part offered on the altar.  According to Bet Shammai the sacrifice that is completely for God, the pilgrimage offering, is the more expensive offering.  If we extrapolate, we might say that when a person has a limited budget, he should spend more on God than on himself. Bet Hillel holds the opposite the hagigah offering, eaten by people, is to be the more expensive offering.  Extrapolating again, Bet Hillel seems to put humans at the center, focusing on enriching their religious experience by providing them more food."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nWhen people would make their pilgrimage festivals to Jerusalem, they would usually bring with them money which they had used to redeem their second tithe.  Second tithe can be eaten by its owners but only in Jerusalem. To make things easier for people the Torah allows them to redeem the produce for money, take the money to Jerusalem and use it there to buy food items. Our mishnah deals with which sacrifices one can buy from second tithe money and which have to be purchased with “hullin,” unconsecrated money.  It is in the best interests of the pilgrim to be able to use his second tithe money, money which he will have to spend in Jerusalem in any case.",
                    "<b>Burnt-offerings during the festival [week] are to be brought from [animals bought with] unconsecrated money, and thanksgiving offerings, from [animals bought with] tithe money.</b>  This section deals with hol hamoed, the middle of the week of Sukkot and Pesah.  Burnt-offerings, the pilgrimage offerings, which are obligatory, must be brought with animals purchased with unconsecrated money. This is the same rule as for all mandatory offerings they may not be purchased with tithe money. Celebratory thanksgiving offering, brought during the middle of the festival are not obligatory as are the other festival offerings.  A person has to eat meat during the week and while it was customary to use thanksgiving offerings, it was not mandated.  Since this sacrifice wasn’t mandated, one can use tithe money to purchase it.",
                    "<b>On the first festival day of Pesah: Bet Shammai say: [they must be brought] from [animals bought with] unconsecrated money. And Bet Hillel say: [they can be brought also] from [animals bought with] tithe money.</b>  On the first day of both Pesah and Sukkot, and on Shavuot, the thanksgiving offering, the hagigah, is obligatory.  Since it is a mandated offering, Bet Shammai holds that it must come from animals purchased with unconsecrated money.  Bet Hillel holds that one can still use tithe money because the hagigah is partially eaten by its owners. The Torah states that second tithe must be used to purchase food and the hagigah is food. According to the Talmud, second tithe cannot be used to purchase the whole animal, because some of the animal is offered on the altar.  It may only be used as part of the purchasing price."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nDuring the festival it was a mitzvah to celebrate by eating meat. This was done by bringing celebratory thanksgiving offerings to the Temple and eating them in Jerusalem.  Our mishnah teaches that both Israelites and priests can use animals and meat dedicated or made holy for other purposes in order to fulfill this obligation.",
                    "<b>Israelites fulfill their obligation with vow-offerings, freewill-offerings and cattle tithe.</b>  An Israelite can fulfill his obligation to bring/eat a celebratory thanksgiving offering by bringing vow-offerings and freewill-offerings that he had set aside during the year for other purposes. During the year a person might make an offering to the Temple for all sorts of reasons (as a supplication, to show gratitude).  He may take this animal with him on his pilgrimage and it can count as his celebratory thanksgiving offering.  Cattle tithe, the tenth animal born of cows, sheep and goats, is “holy to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This animal is brought to Jerusalem and eaten there.  An Israelite can use an animal that was set aside to be cattle tithe as his celebratory thanksgiving offering.",
                    "<b>And priests with sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, firstlings, the breast and the shoulder,   but not with bird-offerings, and not with meal-offerings.</b>  Pilgrims would also bring with them the various sin-offerings and guilt-offerings that they had become liable for during the year. They would also bring the “firstlings”, the first-born of every kosher animal.  All of these go to the priest and he may use them to fulfill his obligation for celebratory thanksgiving offerings.  The breast and the shoulder of thanksgiving offerings go to the priest.  This meat will count for him in order to fulfill his obligation for eating meat. However, bird-offerings and meal-offerings don’t count because one can only fulfill the obligation with mammal meat sheep, goats and cows."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nAs I have explained in the previous mishnayot, the pilgrimage offering is a wholly burnt offering and is not eaten, whereas the celebratory offering is a thanksgiving offering and is eaten.  Our mishnah gives four different possibilities for how much of each offering a person should bring.",
                    "<b>He that has many people to eat [with him] and little money, brings many thanksgiving-offerings and few burnt-offerings.</b>  If a person has a lot of people he needs to feed and not a lot of money with which to buy the animals to use as sacrifices, he should spend more money on the edible thanksgiving offerings and less on the burnt offerings.",

If he buys too many thanksgiving offerings (or too large of an animal) the meat will have to be burned (not as a sacrifice but as the remnant of uneaten sacrifice).",

Our mishnah makes reference to mishnah 2 above where Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel debated the minimum amount for each sacrifice.",

The mishnah quotes the verse which says that each brings according to his own blessing, meaning he can bring as many sacrifices as he wants."

This is derived from Leviticus 23:41 which says, “You shall observe it as a festival of the Lord for seven days” implying that the hagigah can be brought throughout the festival.",
                    "<b>He who did not bring his hagigah on the first day of the festival of Sukkot, may bring it during the whole of the festival, even on the last festival day of Sukkot.</b>  Even though the last day of Sukkot is a different festival called Shmini Atzeret, nevertheless even on this day one can bring his hagigah offering and have it count as his Sukkot hagigah.",

Of such a person it is said: “A twisted thing cannot be made straight, a lack cannot be made good” (Ecclesiastes 1:15).</b>  Once the festival is over, he cannot bring the hagigah offering.  Even if he set aside an animal to be a hagigah and then it was lost during the festival and found afterwards, he cannot offer that animal as a hagigah.  In such a case the animal would be offered as a freewill offering.  The mistake of not bringing the hagigah during the correct time is a “lack that cannot be made good.”"

Should you say that it applies to a thief or robber, he is able to restore [the stolen object] and make straight.</b>  Most transgressions can be “made straight,” that is to say they can be fixed. The damage is not irreparable. However, when a man has intercourse with a woman forbidden to him and they have a child, that child is a mamzer for life, there is nothing he can do to get out of this status.  He/she will forever be a mamzer, restricted in marriage. Other sins such as stealing can be repaired by returning the stolen object.",

A disciple of the sages who forsakes the Torah.</b>  Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai reads the verse slightly differently.  The verse does not relate simply to a wrong that cannot be corrected.  Something is only considered to be twisted if it was originally straight.  A mamzer was born “twisted” and hence is not referred to in the verse.  Rather the verse refers to a Torah scholar who rejects his Torah learning.  He was straight when he was dedicated to a life of Torah and became twisted when he separated from that life. The Talmud on this mishnah contains many of the legends about the famous Elisha ben Abuyah, the great Torah sage who later rejected his learning, professing, “there is no law and no judge.”  For a very interesting read, one which illuminates the mishnaic period better than any book I know, check out Milton Steinberg’s “As A Driven Leaf.”"

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah, and the first two mishnayot of the next chapter, do not deal with the hagigah. Rather they are loosely connected to the end of the previous mishnah concerning the Torah scholar who separates from the Torah.  Our mishnah deals with one issue which may have caused some rabbis to dismiss the Torah, especially the Oral Torah.  There are many halakhot in the Mishnah which seem to have little connection to the Written Torah.  Some rabbis may have rejected rabbinic learning claiming that the rabbis were just “making it up.”  This was a common anti-rabbinic claim made throughout Jewish history, most famously by the Sadducees and later by the Karaites.  Our mishnah acknowledges that some halakhot are indeed not well connected to Scripture and yet at the same time the mishnah seems to bequeath to these laws the same authority as those firmly anchored in the Written Torah.",
                    "<b>[The laws concerning] the dissolution of vows hover in the air and have nothing to rest on.</b>  According to the rabbis, a sage has the power to dissolve a vow.  This was a subject we covered when we learned Tractate Nedarim.  However, there is no scriptural basis, no verses in the Torah, that give the rabbis (or anyone else) such power.  These halakhot “hover in the air” meaning they are not grounded in the written Torah.",
                    "<b>The laws concerning Shabbat, hagigot, and trespassing are as mountains hanging by a hair, for they have scant scriptural basis but many halakhot.</b>  There are three categories of halakhah which have some scriptural basis, but not a lot and yet they have a lot of halakhot in the Mishnah and in other rabbinic works. The first of these is Shabbat.  There were 24 chapters in Mishnah Shabbat and another 11 in Eruvin and yet the Torah barely discusses what types of work are prohibited on Shabbat. Hagigah, the subject of our tractate, is also another case of a lot of halakhah with little scriptural basis.  The Torah only says the word “hag,” which the rabbis interpret to mean a sacrifice. This is not a lot of scriptural support for a whole tractate.  Finally, “trespassing” which means illicit use of Temple property. There is a whole tractate called Meilah dedicate to this subject, and yet it too has scant scriptural support.",
                    "<b>[The laws concerning] civil cases and [Temple] worship, purity and impurity, and the forbidden relations have what to rest on, and they that are the essentials of the Torah.</b>  The Torah is full of verses dedicated to civil laws, the main topic of all of Seder Nezikin, Temple worship, the main topic of Seder Kodashim, purity laws, the main topic of Seder Toharot and the laws of forbidden relations, the main topic of large parts of Seder Nashim.

There are some subjects which are, according to our mishnah, dangerous to speculate upon or to discuss in front of the masses.  Pondering upon the unknowable may have contributed towards apostasy.<br>Section one:  The danger of expounding upon the verses about forbidden relations in the Torah is either that people will be confused and make irreparable mistakes (i.e. create mamzerim) or that they will be titillated by the attention paid to these verses and they will not be able to control their urges and they will come to sin. Therefore, these verses are not expounded before even a group as small as three.<br>Section two: How the world was created and whether it was created from already existing material was a much debated and sensitive issue in the ancient world.  That there might have been material which pre-existed God would have been seen by the rabbis to be heretical.  Due to the speculative nature of this subject, it was forbidden to talk about it in front of even two people.<br>Section three: The study of the chariot, Ezekiel’s heavenly vision (Ezekiel 1) is the mystical study of God, God’s physical attributes and God’s unknowable mysteries.  The sages seem to have believed that God had a physical existence, perhaps even a body in a certain sense, but that God’s body was hidden from human beings.  It was forbidden for one sage to teach this subject to another sage unless the learning sage could understand things without really being explained to them.  What this seems to mean is that one sage could begin to discuss this topic with another sage but he shouldn’t reveal to him the secrets of God unless he sees that the sage understands and can proceed on his own.  However, we interpret this, what is clear is that the sages were extremely hesitant to engage publicly in mysticism.<br>Section four: There were some things that humans couldn’t know and therefore should not try to know. They are:  1) what is above the sky; 2) what is below the earth; 3) what came before the earth was created; 4) what will come after it is destroyed.  Again, these four subjects are (or at least were) completely speculative.  A person should spend their time in this world studying subjects that are knowable, such as the interpretation of Torah and halakhah.  Metaphysical speculation was ruled out by this mishnah.  The final line of the mishnah seems to be a continuation of the previous line.  Those who try to uncover God’s secrets and reveal them to the public are not acting with respect to God’s honor.  It is almost as if they are undressing God in public.  Had God wanted these secrets to be revealed they would have been revealed.<br>I should note that there do seem to have been rabbis in this period who did engage in such speculative study and even composed works dedicated to the topic.  There are two ways to justify this mishnah with those other works.  First of all, there were different groups of rabbis, some of which focused on halakhah/midrash and others who focused on mysticism.  The second possibility, which I believe to be more likely, is that the rabbis thought that mysticism was not an appropriate focus for most people’s study.  Mysticism, which they considered dangerous, should be reserved for the elite and not spread to the masses."

Hillel says that it may be performed.<br>The former [of each] pair were patriarchs and the latter were heads of the court.</b><br>Our mishnah is possibly the most unique mishnah in the entire Mishnah.  It contains a debate about whether or not a person can lay their hands on a sacrifice on Yom Tov, the first and last days of a festival.  According to Leviticus 1:4 and other parallel verses, when a person brings a sacrifice he lays his hands, or leans, on the sacrifice before it is slaughtered.  On Yom Tov it is forbidden to use an animal and leaning on an animal is considered to be use of an animal.  Therefore, the question could be asked, can one lean on the sacrificial animal on Yom Tov or must he do so the day before?<br>What is unique about our mishnah is that there are five pairs (zugot) of sages, each from a different generation, who debated this issue.  The sages here are early sages who lived during the Second Temple period, from the beginning of the Hasmonean period until close to the beginning of the millennium.  They might even be called proto-sages, or proto-rabbis.  With one exception, all of these sages are found in Avot 1:4-10, where each transmits a moral exhortation.  The final clause of the mishnah determines that of each pair the first was the patriarch and the second was the head of the court.  As far as I know, there are no other mishnayot that have this structure in which the same debate being repeated generation after generation.<br>The fact that they debate specifically this issue is significant.  We know that ancient Jews argued a lot about the laws of Yom Tov and Shabbat and that the Pharisees tended to be more lenient than the other two main sects, the Essenes and the Sadducees.  This seems to be the trend in this mishnah as well Hillel allows one to lean on the animal, whereas Shammai does not.<br>Section four:  Note that the mishnah switches order here.  In all three previous pairs, the first said that it may not be performed, whereas the second said that it should be performed.  It seems that there may have been some historical switch at this period, where the position of the patriarch changed.<br>Section five:  Little is known about Menahem from rabbinic literature, except that he seems to have separated from the fold.  Josephus, Antiquities 15:10, 5 relates a story about a certain Menahem who was an Essene.  This Menahem receives a divine revelation that Herod will become king and he relates it to him.  According to some scholars this is the same Menahem referred to in our mishnah.  In any case, it is interesting that he is replaced by Shammai.  It is as if the mishnah is letting us know that Shammai is not like Menahem. While Shammai’s opinions are usually not the accepted halakhah, he is still legitimate."

Bet Shammai states that wholly burnt-offerings cannot be brought on Yom Tov at all since they are not eaten. The Torah permits preparing food on Yom Tov (see Tractate Betzah) but since wholly-burnt offerings are not food, they may not be prepared on Yom Tov.  The wholly burnt offering which must be brought on account of the festival (re’eyah) should be sacrificed during the festival week. Bet Hillel allows the bringing of wholly burnt offerings because they hold that any work that is permitted when it is done in the preparation of food is also permitted when it is done for other reasons. Bet Shammai rules as did their eponymous leader in the previous mishnah, that it is forbidden to lay hands on the sacrificial animal on Yom Tov because that is considered to be making the animal work.

The Sadducees held that the Omer began to be brought on the day after Shabbat, hence Shavuot would always fall on Sunday, seven weeks later. The Pharisees/rabbis held that the Omer began to be brought on the second day of Pesah, and hence the day of the week of Shavuot would vary from year to year depending upon the day of the week upon which the first day of Pesah fell.  We just learned that if Atzeret fell on Shabbat, they would slaughter the wholly-burnt offerings on Sunday. The problem this creates is that people will think that the halakhah is like the Sadducees.  To avoid creating this impression, the rabbis distinguished between this day of slaughter and a normal festival in several ways which would have been evident to the public. First of all the high priest would not wear his eight special garments that he normally wears while performing his worship service. Second, mourning and fasting was permitted. People who saw these changes would understand that the only reason that they were offering the sacrifices on Sunday was that they could not be offered on Shabbat. They would not think that the sages were actually postponing Shavuot to Sunday."

The reason why these laws are here is that when Israel would come to Jerusalem and to the Temple for the festival they had to be pure in order to eat their sacrifices.  They would immerse their vessels to purify them before Yom Tov. During the festival all of the people of Israel acted like the Pharisees and were extra stringent on eating only while in a state of ritual purity.\nOur mishnah deals with the topic of washing hands versus washing one’s whole body. There are some foods which only required one’s hands to be washed while holier foods required one to immerse one’s entire body.",

There is nothing wrong with eating impure food but the Pharisees wished to preserve the laws of purity on a higher level than was required.  During the festival, in Jerusalem everyone was expected to purify their hands before eating, even unconsecrated food.  Second tithe and terumah are holy and therefore they certainly require one to wash one’s hands before being touched. The handwashing referred to here is done with water poured over one’s hands with a vessel.",

In the Talmud they debate what this section refers to. According to one opinion this clause refers only to hands which were certainly made impure.  Unless one knows that one’s hands had become impure, it would be sufficient to wash them with a vessel.  According to the other opinion, in all cases before one eats sacrificial meat one must wash hands by immersing them in the mikveh.",

But the sages say: because they were overlaid [with metal].</b>  There were two vessels in the Temple that did not require immersion, the two altars. The bronze altar was used for the sacrifices and the gold altar was used for the burning of the incense.  There is a debate between Rabbi Eliezer and the sages why these altars do not require immersion. According to Rabbi Eliezer because they are attached to the ground, they are treated like the ground which cannot become impure. According to the sages their metal covering prevents impurity from getting to the vessel itself. The metal covering itself cannot become impure because it is not a vessel. Congratulations!  We have finished Moed Katan and Seder Moed! It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. For those of you who have been following along with Mishnah Yomit from its beginning, you have now learned half of the entire Mishnah!  We began with Seder Nezikin, continued with Seder Nashim and now we have finished Seder Moed. This is quite an impressive amount of learning.  These are the three orders of Mishnah most learned and for which there exists both Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds.  You should feel really good about this accomplishment and hopefully, you are looking at the proverbial glass as half full. However, we still have half the Mishnah to go. Mishnah Yomit never lets up. Tomorrow we begin Seder Zeraim, Tractate Berakhot."
