            "﻿Tractate Eruvin is a continuation of tractate Shabbat.  Most of Eruvin deals with the different types of domains: public, private and two in-between domains, which we shall explain when they appear. The categorization of property into different domains is relevant for the laws of carrying.  The tractate also deals with the borders outside of a city which one may not go past on Shabbat.  ",
            "In order to understand Eruvin it is helpful to understand how a typical city was structured in the mishnaic period.  Houses shared a courtyard, each house opening up to a courtyard.  Alleys connected several courtyards to the public areas, and there were two different types of alleys, a closed one (mavoy satum) and an open one (mavoy mefulash). A closed alley opened to the public domain on only one side, whereas an open alley was open on both sides.  ",
            "Our tractate will deal with two different types of “eruvin”.  Literally “eruv” means to mix something.  This meaning will become apparent as we learn what an eruv is.  According to Torah law (deoraita) it is permitted to carry something out of a house and bring it into a courtyard and vice versa.  Similarly, one may, according to Torah law, carry something from a courtyard into a closed alley, provided that the open end of the alley had either a sidepost (lehi) or a beam (korah) over its top.  The pole and the beam serve symbolically to close off the alley such that it is in reality closed from three sides and symbolically closed from the fourth.  ",
            "The sages feared that if they allowed carrying from the courtyard or closed alley or house into one of the other of these areas (for instance from their house into the courtyard), people would forget and they would also carry into the public domain.  Therefore they forbade this unless one set up an “eruv”.  An “eruv” is a meal shared by all of the members of the courtyard, which turns the courtyard into a fictional private domain.  Similarly, if they wanted to carry in the closed alley, all of the members of the alley had to share in a meal set up in one of the houses.  The eruv for the courtyard is called “the courtyard eruv” (eruvei hatzerot) and the alley eruv is called “alley partnerships” (shitufei mevuot).   Tractate Eruvin deals with the details of how these eruvin work.",
            "The second (or really third) type of eruv is the “border eruv” (eruvei techumin). On Shabbat it is forbidden for a person to go more than 2000 cubits outside of the place where he is when Shabbat began.  However, if he is in a city, he may travel freely anywhere within that city, no matter how large it is.  The 2000 cubits are counted from outside of the city.  This halakhah is learned from Exodus 16:29-30, “‘Let everyone remain where he is; let no one leave his place on the seventh day.’ So the people remained inactive on the seventh day.”  “His place” is defined by the rabbis as his city, and not merely his house.  The border of two thousand cubits is derived midrashically from Numbers 35:5, a verse which deals with the fields surrounding the Levite cities.  ",
            "If a person needs to go beyond the Shabbat border for the purposes of a commandment, for instance to learn Torah or for a circumcision, the rabbis allowed him to set up an eruv that would allow him to extend that distance by another 2000 cubits. What he would do is put a meal someplace within his border and then from that point he could walk another 2000 cubits.  If, for instance, he were to put his meal 2000 cubits outside the city, he could then walk 4000 cubits on Shabbat.  However, if he does so, on the other side of the city he can not walk out at al.  The 2000 cubits on the one side means that his border is at that point and therefore he can’t walk out at all on the other side of the city.  However, if he left it 1000 cubits outside of the city on one side, he could then walk 3000 cubits on that side and 1000 cubits on the other side.  Our tractate deals extensively with the details these laws as well."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe first mishnah in Eruvin deals with the entrance to a closed alley.  As we mentioned in the introduction, Torah law allows one to carry within this alley.  However, the sages forbade this unless there is either a side-post or a cross-beam on top of the entrance.  The purpose of either the side-post or the cross-beam was so that people would recognize that the alley was not a public domain and they would realize that while it is permitted to carry in the alley, it is forbidden to carry in the public domain.",
                    "<b>[The crossbeam] of an alley [whose entrance] is more than twenty cubits high should be lowered. Rabbi Judah says: this is unnecessary.</b>  The crossbeam cannot be more than twenty cubits high, otherwise people will not notice it.  This is the same rule as the sukkah the sukkah’s roof (skhakh) cannot be more than twenty cubits high because people should notice that they are sitting in a sukkah.  In both cases, that of the crossbeam and the sukkah, Rabbi Judah rules that they may be more than twenty cubits high.",
                    "<b>And [any entrance] that is wider than ten cubits should be reduced [in width].</b>  An entrance to an alley may not be more than ten cubits wide for it to be allowed to carry within the alley.  If it is more than ten cubits, then it’s not truly an entranceway but a gap in the walls of the alley.  If it is more than ten cubits wide he can reduce it in order to carry in the alley.",
                    "<b>But if it has the shape of a doorway there is no need to reduce it even though it is wider than ten cubits.</b>  If the opening has the shape of a doorway, meaning there are poles on both sides and a beam on top of it, then it looks like an entrance and it may be wider than ten cubits.  According to the Rambam, if it has such an opening, the beam may even be more than twenty cubits high."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn this mishnah Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel debate how one validates an alley such that it is permitted to carry within it.",
                    "There are two levels of debates in this mishnah. There is a debate between Bet Shammai, Bet Hillel and R. Eliezer about how one validates an alley.  The second debate is between Rabbi Ishmael, as presented by one of his students, and Rabbi Akiva over what was the actual dispute between Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai.",
                    "<b>The validation of an alley: Bet Shammai says: a side-post and a crossbeam. And Bet Hillel says: either a side-post or a crossbeam. R. Eliezer says: two side-posts.</b>  In this version, Bet Shammai says that the alley must have the side-post and a crossbeam in order to carry in it, whereas Bet Hillel says that either is sufficient.  Rabbi Eliezer says that the crossbeam is irrelevant and that what are needed are two side-posts.",
                    "<b>In the name of Rabbi Ishmael one student stated in front of Rabbi Akiva: Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel did not disagree concerning an alley that was less than four cubits [in width], that it [may be validated] by either a side-post or a crossbeam. About what did they disagree?  In the case of one that was wider than four, and narrower than ten cubits:  Bet Shammai says: both a side-post and a crossbeam [are required] and Bet Hillel says: either a side-post or a crossbeam. Rabbi Akiva said they disagree about both cases.</b>  In this statement, a student of Rabbi Ishmael’s comes in front of Rabbi Akiva to present a more limited version of the debate.  According to this version, both houses agree that if the alley is less than four cubits wide, either a side-post or crossbeam is sufficient.  Probably the reason that Bet Shammai agrees in this case is that if the entrance is narrower it is clearer that this is not a public domain.  The debate is only when the entrance is between four and ten cubits wide. Rabbi Akiva rejects this version and rules that in both cases, Bet Hillel and Bet Shammai disagree.  The first section of the mishnah is therefore representative of Rabbi Akiva’s position. As an aside, we can learn a fair amount of rabbinic history from this mishnah.  Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Ishmael were the heads of competing academies, some time in the early part of the second century CE.  Both academies produced midrashic compilations that while similar to each, have notable differences.  This mishnah is one indicator that Rabbi Akiva’s academy became more dominant, perhaps especially so after Rabbi Ishmael’s demise.  Rabbi Ishmael’s students come in front of Rabbi Akiva to see if their traditions are acceptable in his eyes.  This is a sign of their turning to his authority, probably after their own master’s death.  Rabbi Akiva rejects the Ishmaelian tradition and the anonymous piece which opens the mishnah is taught according to Rabbi Akiva.  Indeed, the Mishnah is a work produced by the Akivan academy, a work in which Akiva’s students, most notably Rabbis Judah, Meir, Shimon and Yose dominate."

This way when the brick is placed on the cross-beam there will be a little space on each side (a finger on each side), where they can put the mortar to attach the brick to the beam.  Even if the cross-beam is not actually attached to the brick, at least it looks as if it will be. This lends it more of an air of permanence."

This is the minimum measurement for most things that need to be a certain height. For instance a sukkah must be ten handbreadths high. The mishnah uses the plural form of “side-posts” even though Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel require only one side-post, to teach that even those who follow Rabbi Eliezer, who does require two side-posts must still make them ten handbreadths high. According to the first opinion in the mishnah, there is no minimum measurement for their width and thickness.

It is called by the rabbis a “karmelit” and it is forbidden by rabbinic ordinance (derabbanan) to carry within one.  However, if the caravan which finds itself on Shabbat in a valley sets up there a makeshift fence by using the instruments used in caring for the cattle, they may carry within this area, if several conditions are met.  First of all, the instruments must be ten handbreadths high to be considered a “fence.”  This is because walls must be ten handbreadths high.  Second, the gaps between the instruments cannot be greater than the area covered by the instruments.  In other words, more must be closed than open. Thirdly, there can be no gap greater than ten cubits.  A ten or less cubit gap can be considered an entrance to this enclosed area.  More than that cannot be considered an entrance and thus turns the entire area into an unfenced area.  This is true even if the total area closed by the instruments is greater than the gaps.  However, if they put up two side-posts and a crossbeam over a more than ten cubit gap, this would turn the gap into an entrance and it would become permitted to carry within the area."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn yesterday’s mishnah we learned that a caravan that finds itself on Shabbat in a valley (which really just means any uninhabited area) may surround themselves with their cattle instruments to form a makeshift fence which allows them to carry within the fenced-in area.  One condition for this fence to be effective was that the closed part would be larger than the open gaps in this “fence”.  Our mishnah discusses another way of making a fence, one that requires even less material.\nIn order to understand this mishnah we need to understand the principle of “levud”.  This principle means that an open area of less than three handbreadths can be treated as if it was actually closed.  We shall see below how this works in our context.  When we learn Sukkah, we shall see that one can hang the sukkah’s walls down from the top and as long as they fall to within three handbreadths of the ground the sukkah is valid because a less than three handbreadth gap is treated as if it legally does not exist.",

The size of the ropes [must be such] that their [total] thickness is more than a handbreadth, so that the total height is ten handbreadths.</b> The mishnah says that they may encircle their encampment with three ropes, one above the other, to form a fence.  Each rope should not be more than three handbreadths apart from the rope on top of it.  This way there is no gap in the fence of three handbreadths or more, and as we learned above, a gap of less than three handbreadths can legally be considered to be closed. The total thickness of the ropes must be greater than one handbreadth, so that the caravan is left with a “fence” ten handbreadths high. To summarize, the caravan has a ten handbreadths high wall, up to nine of which is in reality empty space and a little over one of which is made up of rope.  Even though in this fence the gaps are certainly greater than the closed part, it is effective because all of gaps are less than three handbreadths and therefore don’t legally exist."

Today we see how a partition can be set up horizontally. This is done by setting up reeds (poles) around the encampment.  Between each reed there can be no more than three handbreadths, for less than three handbreadths is an amount that is legally considered as if it doesn’t exist.",

The rabbis now debate whether the same type of partition may be used in other cases as well.  According to Rabbi Judah, the previous mishnayot relate only to the situation of a caravan.  An individual stuck out in an uninhabited place for Shabbat would have to make a partition of both horizontal and vertical pieces in order to carry within.

Second, they need not wash their hands before eating.  Third, if they are eating doubtfully tithed produce (demai), they need not tithe it.  Tithing demai is only a rabbinic obligation and hence there is space to be lenient.  Fourth, to carry from tent to tent within the encampment, they do not need to set up an eruv (a communal meal).

Each corner post would have two pieces of wood set at a right angle so that it would look as if there were four walls. Rabbi Meir says that it is not sufficient for there to be four corner-posts.

In the Talmud it is explained that each cow is a cubit and two-thirds thick, making a total of 10 cubits.  Rabbi Judah is again more lenient and allows a gap large enough for two teams of four cows, which adds up to 13 1/3 cubits. The end of the mishnah notes that these teams of cattle are to be tied to each other, and not walking separately.  When they are untied the distance between them is even greater.  Furthermore, the reference is not to two teams entering simultaneously, but rather to one team coming in and one going out.  This is slightly larger than two teams of cattle going in the same direction."

This is about 5000 square cubits (about 50 meters by 25 meters), the size of the mishkan (the tabernacle). The other sages respond to Rabbi Judah that the measure of 5000 square cubits does not apply to the halakhah about the enclosure surrounding a well, but rather applies to a garden or a karpaf, neither of which are enclosed as living spaces but rather to keep out animals or thieves.  A karpaf is a large field behind a house or a courtyard or outside of a city which has been enclosed so that it can store wood.  Since these are fenced in only to keep things out and not to keep things in, they have a relatively small minimum measurement.  In contrast, things which are enclosed for those things which inhabit them, such as a pen, a sahar (a pen in the field to keep in the flocks), a backyard or a courtyard can be even the size of five or even ten bet kor.  A kor is 30 se’ah, so this measure is significantly larger. The final clause of the mishnah is a repeat of the last clause in yesterday’s mishnah.  Since the enclosure of a well is also enclosed for the use of those who wish to drink the water in the well, it to may be as large as one wants it to be. In summary, according to the sages there is a simple rule:  if it is enclosed as a living space for either people or animals, the enclosure may be as large as one wants it to be.  If it is enclosed to protect something stored inside, then the limit is two bet se’ah."

In such a situation it would be forbidden to draw water from the well on Shabbat.  Therefore, the public road must be diverted.

The fence around the enclosure is a special rabbinic enactment which permits carrying only while there is water in the well/cistern.  The waters of a well will not dry up.  Furthermore, since this cistern is owned by a private individual, she/he may forget that it is forbidden to carry into the public domain.

If one of the people did not participate in setting up the eruv (meaning he did not help pay for the meal) then it is generally forbidden for everyone to carry from their homes into the courtyard since all of those who own the courtyard did not participate in the eruv.

The Talmud explains that in the case described by the mishnah, the person who did not share in the eruv annuls his partial ownership of the courtyard, thereby granting those who did participate in the eruv full ownership over the courtyard. In such a case, all of the other people who share the courtyard may carry from their homes to the courtyard and even from his home to the courtyard, since he annulled his ownership.  However, he may not carry from his home to the courtyard because that would look like he is retracting his annulment, an act which would make carrying forbidden.

It is still prohibited from rabbinic law to take something from a karmelit to another domain.  However, when it comes to an eruv, it need only be in its place at twilight and the prohibition to carry at twilight is in itself only of rabbinic origin.

Probably, this is the most typical situation a person sets up an eruv before Shabbat and then checks it on Shabbat and sees that it has been ruined but does not know when it happened.  Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Judah use a proverb to describe this situation he is like a camel driver and a donkey driver.  A camel driver stands in front of the camel and pulls him along.  A donkey driver stands behind the donkey and whips him to go forward faster.  Someone who needs to drive both a camel and a donkey has a problem if he whips the donkey he’ll bump into the camel and if he pulls the camel he’ll go to fast for the donkey.  All he can do is go at a medium pace between the two animals.  This is the situation of one whose Shabbat border eruv may be invalid he loses in both directions.  To remember, an effective Shabbat border eruv extends his Shabbat limit in one direction by 2000 cubits, but causes him to lose 2000 cubits in the other direction.  If he sets it 2000 cubits to the west of the city, he can go 4000 cubits in that direction, but he can’t go any cubits to the east of the city.  In our situation, let’s say he set up the eruv 2000 cubits to the west and then discovered that it was invalid but does not know when it occurred.  He cannot go another 2000 cubits to the west because the eruv might be invalid.  However, he also cannot go 2000 cubits to the east of the city (or any other direction) lest his eruv is valid.  In other words, he loses in both directions. Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon say that a doubtful eruv is effective. This is because it was known to be existent before Shabbat and was only known to be nonexistent after Shabbat started.  We can presume that it existed until we know that it did not, and therefore, we can presume that it existed at twilight, the critical time.

If the sages agree that the two days are distinct entities of holiness, then they should agree that one could set up two different eruvin.  If they weren’t then the eruv which was good for the first day should also be good for the second, even if it has been eaten up. The mishnah does not provide an answer from the sages.  In the Talmud it is explained that the sages don’t know whether the two days are distinct or not, and therefore they are strict in both cases.  They don’t allow two different eruvin to be set up, lest they are not distinct.

This was decided by the testimony of witnesses who would come to the court in Jerusalem and testify that they had seen a new moon (we will learn about this in tractate Rosh Hashanah).  Therefore, before the calendar was fully fixed, on the 28th day of a month, a person would not know if the next day will be Rosh Hodesh (the first of the month) or the last day of the preceding month.  This was an especially significant problem on the last day of Elul, the month that precedes Rosh Hashanah.  Until witnesses came one would not know if the next day was Rosh Hashanah or not.

It is forbidden to eat the produce without separating the tithes and terumah but on Rosh Hashanah it is forbidden to separate them.  Rabbi Judah offers a halakhic solution to this problem, one that would at least allow him to eat the produce on the second day.  On the first day, he takes out the tithes and terumah and declares, “If today is not Rosh Hashanah and tomorrow is, then behold I am separating terumah and tithes for this produce.  But if today is Rosh Hashanah, then my declaring these to be tithes and terumah is invalid.”  On that day he cannot eat them, lest that day actually be Rosh Hashanah, in which case his declaration was invalid.

The prayer to which the mishnah refers is the Amidah, also called the Shmonah Esrei (the Eighteen).  On the first day he must mention “whether it be today or tomorrow” and on the second day “whether it be today or yesterday.” Again, the sages disagree because they hold that we don’t treat the two days as if one was certain and one was doubtful but rather we treat them as one long extended holiday. In the Talmud it teaches that this debate is not only about Rosh Hashanah but Rosh Hodesh (the first of the new month) as well.  The sages hold that prayer is not the time for making legal stipulations.  While the status of these two days may indeed be somewhat doubtful, at least to certain sages, it doesn’t seem appropriate to mention this doubt in prayer, at the point where a person is pouring one’s heart out to God and asking for strength. The expression of such doubts during prayer might lead to doubts concerning the rabbis’ ability in general to dictate when holidays are, or at least lead to doubts concerning the efficacy of the community’s prayers."

Despite the fact that this is not his fault, once outside his border he may not move more than four cubits in any direction. This is the same rule as for one who left his Shabbat border intentionally he may move only four cubits.

Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Akiva remained within four cubits, just as they held with regard to a person taken out of his town and brought to another town.  However, the mishnah notes that this is not the law but rather a stringency.  The halakhah itself distinguishes between a person who is taken from one town to another and one whose ship sets sail for two reasons.  First of all, Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Akiva were on the ship when Shabbat began and therefore when Shabbat began they could walk throughout the entire ship.   Secondly, a ship’s position is constantly changing such that no one can truly stay within four cubits in any case.  They probably wished to be strict upon themselves so that people wouldn’t think that in the case of a person brought to a pen or another city he too may walk throughout the entire area."

If the boat was out of the Shabbat limit of the harbor at dusk, then when the boat docks they may not disembark.  This is what the other rabbis asked Rabban Gamaliel.  He answered them that he had been observing carefully where they were when Shabbat began and he is certain that they were already within the limit of the harbor.  Therefore they may disembark. The relationship of this mishnah to the previous one is slightly tricky.  Above, Rabban Gamaliel held that one who was taken out of his city against his will and put into a second city becomes like the people of the second city.  Hence, we would think that in this situation, where Gentile sailors brought him into the port, even if they docked on Shabbat he should be allowed to disembark.  One answer to this problem is that Rabban Gamaliel is responding to Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Joshua according to their halakhah and not stating his own opinion.  They hold that if they were not within the border of the port before Shabbat began, that they cannot go more than four cubits, so he responds to them that they were within the Shabbat border.

The square’s total area is 4004 x 4004=16,032,016 cubits.  Note that the additional four cubits takes into account the person’s personal four cubits which his body occupies.

He may send some of his bread outside of the city and set his Shabbat place there, without him actually having to go there. However, bread is a leniency and not a requirement.

While on the way, his friend tells him that he will set up the eruv instead, but then his friend does not set up the eruv. According to Rabbi Judah, the person who went out to set up the eruv may go to the other town on Shabbat, even though his friend never set up the eruv for him and the rest of the town.  Since this person began to go on the way to where he wanted to set up his Shabbat place, his situation is like the person in mishnah seven who was traveling and saw a familiar point.  In other words, since he sees where he wants to go, he may establish his Shabbat place there at a distance.  This is an eruv set up by physical presence just at a distance.

The Talmud Yerushalmi explains that Rabbi Eliezer also disagrees with this clause and holds that if he is within two cubits of the border, he may enter. Rabbi Shimon holds that even if he is fifteen cubits outside of the border, he still may enter because when the surveyors set up their marks of Shabbat limits, they do not measure precisely.  This is explained in two different ways. One explanation is that the surveyors leave fifteen cubits extra so that if people take a few steps beyond the Shabbat limit, they can come back.

Rabbi Dostai says that we look at the mountains as if they were pierced.  In other words, their ascent and descent are not taken into account.  The Talmud explains how this is done.  They use a small rope of four cubits, and the person holding below puts the rope next to his heart and the person holding above puts the rope next to his feet.  In this way the four cubits are lessened a certain percentage for every four cubits.  This is the size of the mountain’s ascent and descent, according to the rabbis.  If you are having trouble picturing this, imagine a right triangle with its slope ascending, as if it was going up the mountain.  If the top line is four cubits (the length of the rope) and the person hold the rope below is 3 cubits (the size of an average person), then you have a triangle whose sides are 4, 3 and 5, the side of 5 being the slope going up the hill (all of this is remembered from 10th grade geometry thank you Mr. Formica!).  Thus the five cubits up the mountain are spanned with a four cubit rope, thereby gaining one cubit for every four.  [I hope this helped!]."

The previous mishnayot discussed measuring the city in order to determine the Shabbat border.  The topic is therefore “eruvei techumin” Shabbat border eruvin which allow one to travel an added 2000 cubits outside of the city.  The remainder of the chapter will also deal with this subject.  This mishnah, in contrast, deals with “eruvei hatzerot” courtyard eruvin, or “shitufei mevuoth” alley partnerships, which allow people to carry within the city on Shabbat.  Traditional commentators struggled to understand what this mishnah is doing here and offered various solutions.  Abraham Goldberg, in his modern commentary to Mishnah Eruvin, suggests that there is a certain affinity in language between this mishnah and the preceding mishnayot, but his suggestion is also not without its difficulties.\nIn any case, the mishnah deals with an eruv/shittuf (partnership) that allows one to carry within a city.  A city that has a wall ten handbreadths high, and a gate that is locked at night, is treated like an alley, and hence if there is an “alley partnership” meaning a shared meal (which for convenience sake I will call “an eruv” people can carry within the entire city.  However, there is a difference in this matter between a privately owned city where an individual owns the city and rents out houses to others, and a city owned by many of its residents.  In a privately owned city, they may set up an eruv and everyone may carry in the entire city.   However, in a publicly owned city, they must leave one area that does not participate in the eruv.  This is done so that people don’t forget that it is forbidden to carry in the public domain without an eruv.  The area that does not participate in the city’s eruv may set up its own eruv for its own area, and carry within that area, but not throughout the rest of the city.  The mishnah deals with a city owned by an individual that becomes a publicly owned city and vice versa.  Similarly it deals with the size of the area that cannot participate in a publicly owned city eruv.",

Its status is also not affected by its conversion.  Therefore, they may not set up an eruv to allow people to carry in the entire town.  Rather they must exclude from the area which participates in the eruv a section the size of the town Hadashah in Judea.  “Hadashah” means new, and is mentioned in Joshua 15:37.  Here the name of the city is read “midrashically” it is a new city which adds to the old city, sort of an appendage to the older city.  In this “New City”, there were 50 residents.  According to Rabbi Judah, by excluding an area this size, they may set up an eruv in the rest of the city. Rabbi Shimon disagrees and holds that the excluded part need only be an area the size of three courtyards, each of which has at least two homes.

The people of a large town, who have a small town entirely within their 2000 cubit Shabbat border, may walk throughout the entire small town and it counts only as four cubits toward their Shabbat limit.  The remaining 2000 cubits surrounding the large town continue on the other side.  For instance if there are 96 cubits from the large town to the small town, and the small town is 1800 cubits, he may walk through the whole small town and another 1900 cubits on the other side, since the town itself counts as only four cubits.<br>However, if the Shabbat border of a small town ends within a neighboring large town, the people from the small town can only walk within it up until their border ends.<br>We should note that according to this explanation, the size of the person’s original town does not seem to matter all that much.  All that matters is whether or not the Shabbat border ends within the neighboring town.<br>Section two:  The phrase “how is this so” does not seem to explain the previous clause in the mishnah.  Hence, the Yerushalmi removes the word, whereas the Bavli adds in an entire clause.  In any case, it seems that this is a new section and not a continuation of the previous one.  This section deals with a person from one city who puts his eruv in another city. According to the first opinion, if one puts his eruv in another city that is within the 2000 cubits of one’s own city, the eruv makes the person as if he was a full resident of that city.   Therefore, he may walk the full area of the city, plus 2000 cubits around it, just as can the residents of that city.<br>Rabbi Akiva disagrees and holds that the eruv in the other city works as do all normal eruvin they allow one to walk 2000 cubits beyond the eruv.  If the city in which the eruv was placed goes further, he may not walk in that area of the city."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah is a direct continuation of the second clause of yesterday’s mishnah.  To remind ourselves, Rabbi Akiva and the Sages had a debate concerning a person in one city who places his eruv in another city which is within the Shabbat border of his own city.  According to Rabbi Akiva, this is treated as a normal case he may go 2000 cubits from his eruv and no more.  The Sages hold that the city itself only counts as four cubits and that he may continue to go beyond the city the distance which remains to him after traveling from the first city.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Akiva said to them:  Do you not agree with me that one who puts his eruv in a cave may walk no further than two thousand cubits from the place of his eruv?</b>  One who puts his eruv in a cave outside of his city, may travel another 2000 cubits outside of the eruv, including the length of the cave.  The cave does not count for just four cubits rather each cubit within it counts.  Rabbi Akiva asks the sages why they agree concerning this halakhah but not concerning one who puts his eruv in a neighboring city.  In other words, why in the case of the city does the entire city only count as four cubits, no matter how large it is?",
                    "<b>They replied: when is this true? Only where no people dwell in it, but where people dwell in it one may walk through the whole of it and two thousand cubits beyond it.</b>  The sages respond that the rule regarding one who puts his eruv in a cave is true only if no one lives in the cave.  The situation regarding the city is different when he puts his eruv there he counts as one of its residents.  Just as the city’s residents may travel anywhere in the city and not have it count toward their 2000 cubits, so too he may travel anywhere in the city and not have it count towards his 2000 cubits.",
                    "<b>Thus [where an eruv is put] within [the cave] the law is more lenient than [where one is put] on top of it.</b>  This section is way of remembering the rule of the Sages in section two.  If the eruv is put on top of a cave which is in a city, then the eruv is in the city and he may walk within the entire city and not have it count toward his 2000 cubits.  However, if he puts the eruv in the cave below the city, the cave and certainly the city count toward his 2000 cubit limit. This means that the law is more lenient when the eruv is on top then when it is within.",
                    "<b>And to the measurer, of whom they spoke, they give him a distance of two thousand cubits even if the end of his measure terminates within a cave.</b>  In this section the sages agree with Rabbi Akiva concerning one who measures his Shabbat border, that he gets only 2000 cubits, even if this measure ends in the middle of a cave.  Even if there are residents in the cave, he still cannot go through to the end of the cave, because his original Shabbat limit ended before he got there.  This matches what we learned in the beginning of yesterday’s mishnah, concerning a Shabbat border that ends within a neighboring city.  In such a case, he may only go up to the end of his Shabbat border."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nFrom here until the end of the ninth chapter the Mishnah will discuss courtyard eruvin (eruve hatzerot) and alley partnerships (shittufe mevuoth). These allow people to carry in courtyards and common alleys respectively.  The eruv or shittuf is a common meal, which creates the legal fiction that the entire courtyard or alley is one person’s domain. For a more general introduction, see the introduction to the tractate.\nIn general, everyone who lives in the courtyard or alley must participate in the eruv, meaning they must contribute to the common meal.  If one does not, he causes the entire courtyard or alley to be prohibited from carrying for all of the residents. Our mishnah teaches about a case where one of the residents is a non-Jew or a Jew who doesn’t admit to the validity of eruvin in general.",
                    "<b>One who lives in a courtyard with a non-Jew or with one who does not acknowledge the [principle of] eruv, behold this one restricts him [from making use of the eruv], the words of Rabbi Meir.</b>  According to Rabbi Meir, if a non-Jew or a Jew who doesn’t believe in eruvin (perhaps a Sadducee or Samaritan) lives in a courtyard or alley with other Jews, his lack of participation in the eruv makes it forbidden for other Jews to use the eruv.  As stated above, the eruv must be jointly owned by all of the residents if even one resident does not own it, it doesn’t work.  The Talmud teaches a way to remedy this problem.  The non-Jew can rent to the Jew the part of the courtyard that he owns, and in this way it is as if on Shabbat he doesn’t own it.  Admittedly this is a legal fiction but if it did not exist, it would have been exceedingly difficult to set up eruvin in many, if not all towns, in the mishnaic period, since Jews did not live totally separate from non-Jews.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: one can never restrict another [from making use of the eruv] unless there are two Jews who restrict each other.</b>  According to Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, a non-Jew’s residence in the courtyard or alley does not affect the eruv for the other Jews.  Indeed, his residency doesn’t in essence count.  Only a non-participatory Jew can cause another Jew’s eruv to be ineffective.  If one of the Jewish residents does not participate in the eruv with the other residents, the eruv is ineffective for all of them."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nAccording to the Talmud, in this mishnah Rabban Gamaliel disagrees with the opinion in yesterday’s mishnah. There we learned that a Jew who doesn’t believe in the efficacy of eruvin causes the other Jews in his courtyard or alley to be prohibited from carrying, by making their eruv ineffective.  According to the Talmud, while the non-Jew can annul his partnership in the courtyard or alley, and thereby let the other Jews eruv be effective, a Jew who doesn’t believe in eruvin, such as a Sadducee or Samaritan cannot do so.  Rabban Gamaliel says that even a Sadducee can annul his share in the alley or courtyard.  Our mishnah deals with one who has already made such an annulment.  The question is, can his annulment be overturned by his actions?",
                    "<b>Rabban Gamaliel said: A Sadducee once lived with us in the same alley in Jerusalem and father told us:  “Hurry up and carry out all vessels into the alley before he carries out his and thereby restricts you”.</b>  According to the explanation provided above, this Sadducee who lived in the same alley (!) as Rabban Gamaliel’s father, Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, nullified his partial ownership in the alley such that the eruv of the Jews would be effective.  (A rather nice Sadducee if he was a Samaritan, we could call him the “Good Samaritan”!).  However, Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that if afterwards, on Shabbat, the Sadducee uses the alley to carry out his things then he has reneged on his renunciation and he again owns a share of the alley. Therefore, the Jews must use the alley to carry on Shabbat, so that they own the alley before he does.  Once they have demonstrated such ownership, even if he uses the alley, this does not make it prohibited for them to carry there.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah said [the instruction was given] in different language:  “Hurry up and perform all of your needs in the alley before he carries out his and thereby restricts you”.</b>  According to the Talmud, section one is Rabbi Meir’s version, of what Rabban Gamaliel said his father said.   Rabbi Judah agrees with Rabban Gamaliel, that a Sadducee can renounce his ownership.  However, he disagrees with Rabbi Meir concerning the precise language of Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel’s statement.  According to Rabbi Judah, even if the other Jews use the alley first, if the Sadducee then comes to use it, he will cause it to be prohibited for them to carry there.  Therefore, the Jews must carry all of the things that they need to carry before the Sadducee uses the alley.  Once he uses it, it is prohibited to them."

                    "<b>If one of the residents of a courtyard forgot to join in the eruv, his house is forbidden both to him and to them for the taking in or for the taking out of any object.</b>  The Talmud explains that this resident nullified his partial ownership in the courtyard and alley.  Hence, the other people can carry in those areas.  However, neither he nor they can carry in and out of his house.  They cannot carry in and out of his house because although he nullified his partial ownership in the courtyard and alley, he did not nullify ownership over his own house.  He too cannot carry in and out of his house because the courtyard is owned exclusively by them and his house is owned exclusively by him.",

However, even he can carry from the courtyard to their homes because he is a guest in both their courtyard and their home.  A guest in someone else’s home follows the same rules as does the homeowner himself if the homeowner carries from the courtyard into the home, so too does the guest.",

However, they may not carry from their homes into the courtyard because they are owned by different people. They are not considered to be his guests in his courtyard because many people cannot be considered the guests of one individual.",
                    "<b>If there were two [who forgot to join in the eruv], they restrict each other, because one may give his part and also acquire the part [of others] but two may give their parts but may not acquire the parts [of others].</b>  In this case there were two people who forgot to participate in the eruv.  There is no way for them to carry in the courtyard. Even if the other residents were to give them their share in the courtyard, they can’t carry there.  In such a case both would own the courtyard but neither set up an eruv, so neither can carry.  The Talmud explains that even if one of these now gives his partial ownership of the courtyard to the other, the other still can’t carry there.  When the others nullified their ownership, this nullification didn’t work to allow both of the others to carry there.  We therefore say that the courtyard is still owned by the others and therefore the individual cannot nullify his ownership over a courtyard which he doesn’t fully own. The mishnah summarizes these rules:  one person can annul his ownership and take ownership from others (sections one-three).  Two people can nullify their ownership over the courtyard, but not take ownership from the others (section four)."

Bet Hillel says that it is permitted even after Shabbat has begun.  In other versions of this mishnah Bet Hillel says “even after dusk”, a text that matches my explanation above.

He is not allowed to carry from his own home to the courtyard, which now doesn’t belong to them.  If he does carry his stuff out of his house and into the courtyard he is in essence reneging on his annulment of courtyard ownership.  He now regains his share in the courtyard and thereby prohibits the eruv’s effectiveness for the others (since he didn’t participate in the eruv).  Rabbi Judah says that he is only reneging on his annulment if he carries his things out intentionally.  Rabbi Meir says that his actions cause the others to be restricted whether he carried things out intentionally or unwittingly. He prohibits in the case of the latter, lest one come to permit even in the former.  In other words, if the law were lenient in a case where he carried out unwittingly, people would be lenient in a case where he carried things out intentionally."

The house in which the eruv is placed does not need to participate in the eruv because the fact that it is in his house and he is letting them put it in his house counts as his participation.  Therefore, if the eruv is in the father’s house his children need not participate in paying for the eruv, because they receive their support from their father. Furthermore, if there are no other residents in the courtyard besides the father and his children, then it is all one domain and there is no need for any eruv at all.  Think of it this way:  the meals that they eat at their father’s home are in essence the same as the eruv they make the entire courtyard into one domain. The word “partners” in the first clause of the mishnah means that the same laws which refer to the father and his children also refers to partners all of whom are receiving their food from one provider.  This is a situation exactly parallel to that of the father and the five sons.  Rashi and some other commentators did not have this word in the mishnah which was in front of them, but it appears in good manuscripts of the Mishnah."

There are a few differences between courtyard eruvin and alley partnerships.  A courtyard eruv must consist of bread, whereas any food will suffice for an alley partnership.

He then takes this jar of food and gives it to another person who will accept it on behalf of all of the residents of the alley.

A man’s adult children, wife and Hebrew servants are all independent of him and therefore he may transfer through them ownership of the food to the other people in the alley.  This is true even if he provides food and shelter for these people.  The mishnah need not state that he could confer ownership through other people to whom he is not related.

Therefore, the rabbis instituted courtyard eruvin so that children would remember that without an eruv one cannot carry things out of one’s house into the courtyard or alley, nor carry things within those two areas.

Everyone agrees that all types of food except salt and water may be used to set up an eruv.  The disagreement in our mishnah is about whether a broken loaf of bread may be used.  According to Rabbi Eliezer even a broken loaf is valid.  Rabbi Joshua disagrees and holds that only a full loaf is valid.  Even if it contains a large amount of dough, even a full seah, if it is broken it is not valid.  However, if it is a complete loaf, even if it small, it can count towards one’s eruv.  According to the Rambam, a full loaf can constitute an eruv even if it doesn’t meet the minimum requirements listed above in mishnah eight.

The coin acquires for him the food for the eruv and it is as if he is contributing directly toward the eruv.<br>Section two:  The sages disagree because money cannot acquire movable property (things see the first chapter of Kiddushin).  In order to acquire something, one must lift it up or at least pull it towards himself.  Therefore, he has not acquired the food that the shopkeeper gives for the eruv.  Therefore, he has not effectively contributed to the eruv.<br>Section three:  The sages agree with Rabbi Eliezer that if he gives the money to a different person, meaning some sort of agent, and the agent buys the food from the shopkeeper or baker, this is an effective means to set up an eruv.  This is effective because the person’s agent validly acquires the food from the shopkeeper or baker by actually taking it from him.  Similarly, a person can ask a shopkeeper to set up an eruv on his behalf, since the shopkeeper will give the food to another person, causing the other person to acquire the food, and therefore the shopkeeper is acting as the person’s agent.  The only problematic situation is if the person says to the shopkeeper that his money should acquire the eruv since money cannot effect acquisition, this type of eruv setup is invalid.<br>Section four:  Although this section seems attached to the previous one, it is actually separate.  According to the first opinion, one cannot set up an eruv without the consent of the person who will benefit from the eruv.  This is true, according to this opinion, for both Shabbat border eruvin and courtyard eruvin.  Rabbi Judah, on the other hand, says there is a difference between the two types of eruvin.  Consent is required to set up a Shabbat border eruv for someone because there is some “disability” in this as well.  Namely, if the Shabbat border eruv extends his ability to travel outside the city toward one direction, he loses a commensurate amount in the other direction.  Hence, one cannot set up a Shabbat border eruv for someone without his permission.  However, one only gains by having a courtyard eruv set up on his behalf and therefore, one can set up a courtyard eruv for someone without their consent."

He announces that this eruv will count for anyone who wishes to make use of it. However, unlike alley partnership eruvin, Shabbat border eruvin require the person to accept the eruv actively.  This is because by accepting the extension on one side of town, he loses on the other side of town. The person must accept the eruv before Shabbat begins, since this is the determinative moment for the establishment of eruvin.  He cannot accept the eruv after Shabbat has already begun. Note that the mishnah mentions two common reasons why one would set up a border eruv to pay a shivah call or to visit a house of feasting, a place where a wedding was being celebrated (a wedding which took place before Shabbat).

Even if the water should escape to the public domain, since the person didn’t intend to pour water from a private to a public domain, he has not transgressed any commandments.

The trough must be able to hold at least two se’ah of liquid (about 24 liters), which the sages estimated to be the average amount of water that a person would use in day. The drainage point was at the top of the trough, to allow overflowing liquid a way out.  The mishnah teaches that the trough can either be in or outside the courtyard’s walls.

The Talmud explains that the mishnah relates to a case where they did not set up an eruv.  Pouring out water into the drain is permitted even without an eruv, but the sages said that only the side that set up the eruv is allowed to do so lest the people from the other side take out their waste-water containers and carry them to the other side’s drainage ditches.

                    "<b>Rabbi Shimon says: he should pass them [the tefillin] to his fellow and his fellow should pass them to his fellow, and so on, until they reach the outermost courtyard.</b>  Rabbi Shimon is more lenient than the sages in the previous mishnah concerning bringing tefillin in from the public domain.  While he also obviously cannot just allow a person to carry them in himself since this would be a toraitic prohibition, he does allow one to pass them in from person to person. Since no single person carries the tefillin more than four cubits in the public domain (which would be a toraitic transgression) this is allowed in order to protect the tefillin.  Once the tefillin get to the outermost courtyard, where they will be protected, they shouldn’t pass them any further.",
                    "<b>The same is true in the case of his child:  he passes him to his fellow and his fellow passes him to his fellow, and so on, even if there are a hundred.</b>  This refers to a child who is born out on the field on Shabbat.  The father (or anyone else) may not just carry him, since carrying a child who cannot walk on his own is a violation of carrying on Shabbat.  Rather what he should do, according to Rabbi Shimon, is pass him from person to person until the child reaches the city. According to the Talmud, the other sages disagree with Rabbi Shimon and hold that in cases such as this, it would be better for one person to carry the child all the way back, as long as he stops to rest before he walks four cubits at one time.  In such a way, he does not commit a toraitic transgression of Shabbat.  This is preferred because this involves far less people than does Rabbi Shimon’s suggestion.  In contrast, Rabbi Shimon reasons that advising someone to carry for a distance of less than four cubits at a time is dangerous because he may easily walk too far and thereby commit a toraitic transgression.  We see here that there is a debate over what is worse the appearance of many people together carrying something on Shabbat, or the possibility that one person may commit an actual toraitic transgression.",

People from within the city may pass food or water out to him, even if it goes beyond the Shabbat limit.  The sages partially disagree and hold that one may not pass something beyond the place to which the object’s owner may himself go.  If the owner was dwelling in the city when Shabbat began, then just as he may not go beyond the Shabbat limit, so too his belongings may not be passed beyond that limit."

The threshold is considered a “karmelit” a place that is neither a public nor a private domain.  The scroll’s end rolls out of his hand and goes into the public domain.

According to the first opinion, if the scroll gets to within ten handbreadths of the ground he may not roll it back.  The area within ten handbreadths of the ground is considered to be part of the public domain, and it is forbidden to roll something back from the public domain into a private domain.  What he should do in such a situation is turn the scroll over on its face in order to protect the side which has the writing.

This term denotes an prohibition that the rabbis added to those of the Torah, the point of which is to preserve the character of Shabbat as a day of rest.  In this case, rolling the scroll back is only a violation of “Shabbat rest” and not a deoraita violation.  The reason for this is that he holds one end of the scroll in his hand when he rolls it back he is not taking something that is completely in the public domain and bringing it into the public domain.  According to Rabbi Shimon, the respect and concern for the Holy Writings outweighs the rabbinic prohibition, and therefore he may roll it back."

Since people didn’t regularly go in and out of the muktzeh and it was only used to store items which were not particularly valuable (like produce and wood) it did not have a regular door, with a hinge and lock. Rather the door was just propped up against the opening in the wall and when people went in, they would take the door down and lay it on the ground. The thorns referred to here were used to fill up holes in a wall. The mishnah says that it is forbidden to use these three things (the muktzeh door, the thorns and the reed mats) to make a door. The reason is that these are not actually doors (which have hinges and locks) and therefore one who puts them into the opening of the wall looks like he is building, and not just putting a door in its place.  In other words, this is prohibited because it looks too much like building.  However, if when placing them he raised them from the ground, then it is clearer that he is not building and it is permitted. Others explain differently.  They explain that these three things will make furrows in the ground when the door is opened and it is forbidden on Shabbat to make furrows.

For instance, if he is in the private domain and the door is in the public domain, he could make a partition ten handbreadths high in the public domain, in the area where the key is, so that he and the key would both be in private domains.

There are several explanations for this debate.  One is that Rabbi Eliezer holds that the bolt is not considered to be a “vessel” and hence it is muktzeh.  The knob, which is a vessel, is secondary to the bolt and hence it is not considered.  Rabbi Judah holds that the knob is primary and hence the entire contraption is considered to be a vessel.  Another explanation is that according to Rabbi Eliezer when he puts the bolt into the door, it looks as if he is building, because the bolt is not a “vessel.”  In contrast, Rabbi Joshua holds that since the bolt is a vessel, it does not look as if he is building.",

According to Rabbi Joshua, the people used to prohibit until Rabban Gamaliel came and permitted it. One thing I find interesting in this story (in either version) is the relationship of the rabbi to the synagogue and its customs.  In the beginning, the synagogue operates separately from the realm of the rabbis and in halakhic contradistinction to them.  There certainly is no “synagogue rabbi”, an invention which is rather modern.  However, according to the story, the rabbis seem to be periodically visiting the synagogues and when they get there they issue a halakhic ruling which is followed.

Nevertheless, in contrast to all other cisterns outside of the Temple it was permitted to draw from it using a wheel on festivals. The Hakar cistern was used by the pilgrims during the Second Temple period that came for the festivals.  The prophets and Jewish leaders at the time allowed the Jews to draw from it by means of a wheel on the festival because of the necessity for large quantity of waters for the many pilgrims.

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe final mishnah deals with removing a dead creeping thing, which is a primary source of impurity, from the Temple.",
                    "<b>If a [dead] creeping thing was found in the Temple, a priest should carry it out in his girdle in order not to keep the impurity there any longer than is necessary, the words of Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Judah says: [it should be removed] with wooden tongs in order that uncleanness shall not increase.</b>  In this section we see two different strategies concerning how to respond to a dead creeping thing that found its way into the Temple.  According to Rabbi Yohanan ben Baroka the priest should pick it up with his girdle in order to remove it as fast as possible.  However, he should not pick it up with his hands because that would cause him to become impure.  Even though when he picks it up with the girdle the girdle will become impure, the girdle will not in turn cause him to become impure because clothes don’t impurify people.  The main goal is to get the creeping thing out of the Temple as quickly as possible. Rabbi Judah says that he should pick it up with wooden tongs which cannot become impure.  The problem with this is that it will be harder to catch the creeping thing with wooden tongs than with his girdle.  Nevertheless, according to Rabbi Judah it is preferable not to increase the things which it causes to be impure.",
                    "<b>From where must it be removed? From the sanctuary, from the hall, and from between the hall and the altar, the words of Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas. Rabbi Akiva says: from any place where karet is incurred for entering intentionally and a sin-offering for entering in error from there it must be removed, and from any other place they cover it with a large pot. Rabbi Shimon says:   wherever the sages have permitted you anything they have only given you what is really yours, since they have only permitted you that which is forbidden as shevut.</b>  The second section of the mishnah deals with the question of from where must the creeping thing be removed if it is found in the Temple on Shabbat.  The problem is that by removing the creeping thing he is moving something from one domain to another, which is a violation of carrying on Shabbat, although as we shall see below, it is only a rabbinic violation. According to Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas, it must be found from within the sanctuary and inwards.  However, if it is found in the courtyard they cover it with a pot and leave it there until after Shabbat. Rabbi Akiva expands this area to include any area which makes a person liable for karet if he intentionally enters it impure and for a sin-offering if he unwittingly enters it impure.  Practically speaking, this means that Rabbi Akiva includes the entire courtyard, from within the Nikanor Gate. According to both sages, if the creeping thing is found in another area, one from which it may not be removed, they cover it with a pot so that nothing comes into contact with it. Rabbi Shimon’s comment does not directly relate to this topic but is really a remark meant to complete all of tractate Shabbat and Eruvin, two tractates which are really only one.  Rabbi Shimon explains that all of the leniencies which we have found strewn throughout the two tractates, cases where we thought something would be prohibited but the rabbis allowed one to do the action because there was some necessity, are only cases of the sages giving to the people what is really theirs. This means that the prohibition was only of rabbinic origin in the first place under certain circumstances the rabbis allow what they would otherwise prohibit.  However, Rabbi Shimon is adamant that one not construe these leniencies as rabbis allowing one to abrogate or even circumnavigate toraitic law. It seems to me likely that Rabbi Shimon’s comment is directed at those who doubt the entire validity of eruvin what gives the rabbis the right to allow a person to carry from domain to domain on Shabbat, they ask.  Rabbi Shimon responds that an eruv allows one to carry only in cases where the prohibition is only “derabanan” of rabbinic origin, and not cases which would be prohibited by toraitic law. Congratulations!  We have finished Eruvin. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Eruvin is known as one of the most difficult of tractates, its laws and rules are intricate and very precise.  Perhaps in a more “midrashic” interpretation of the tractate, we saw how one builds a community by sharing a common meal and by sharing Shabbat together.  While the Mishnah Yomit community does not eat together nor spend Shabbat together, I hope that our common Torah learning will serve us all as “spiritual food” (I hope I’m not surprising you all too much by becoming so “mushy”.)  In any case, for those of you who stuck with it and made it through this difficult material, a hearty Yasher Koach. May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more Mishnah!  Tomorrow we begin Pesahim."
