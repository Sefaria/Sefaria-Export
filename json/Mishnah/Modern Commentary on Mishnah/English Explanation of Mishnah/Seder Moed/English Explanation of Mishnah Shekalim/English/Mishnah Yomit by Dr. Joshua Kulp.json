            "In Exodus 30:11:16 God tells Moses that when he counts the children of Israel, he shouldn’t do a simple head count but rather each person should donate half a shekel.  The simple meaning of these verses is that the half-shekel is a one time donation, or at most a donation that is given only when a census is taken.  ",
            "However, the rabbis understood the half-shekel to be an annual donation given to the Temple for the Temple’s upkeep, and for the purchase of the daily tamid and other offerings.  These offerings had to be paid for with public money.  Individuals could not buy them in order to donate them to the Temple.  It is possible that the custom of collecting an annual “tax” from every Israelite already existed in the First Temple period (see II Kings 12:5 and II Chronicles 6:9; see also Nehemiah 10:33, where they give a third of a shekel).  We should note that the Sadducees vehemently disagreed with this halakhah.  They held that an individual could donate the tamid offering and they denied that there was a yearly half-shekel tax.   ",
            "The value of a “half-shekel” might vary from time to time, because the half-shekel which they are referring to is a Torah half-shekel.  In the Mishnah they assume that a shekel is worth a “sela”, which is four dinars (a Roman currency).  Therefore, half a shekel is assumed to be two dinars.  This two dinars is usually called a “shekel”.  Hence, throughout the tractate when the mishnah says “shekel” it is referring to the half-shekel (I realize that this is confusing).  ",
            "According to the Mishnah, they began to remind people to donate the half-shekel in the beginning of the month of Adar.  This is where the custom, observed to this day, developed to read “Parshat Shekalim”, the above mentioned passage in Exodus, on the first Shabbat of Adar of every year.  ",
            "Our tractate deals with many of the details of these laws, how the half-shekel was collected, what was done with it and who handles Temple funds.  There is a lot of information in this tractate about the financing of the Temple, so perhaps it will be interesting to any accountants out there!  The Babylonian Talmud does not contain a commentary on this tractate, as it does for all of the other tractates in Seder Moed.  This is assumedly because none of the tractate was practically applicable after the destruction of the Temple.  However, there is commentary in the Palestinian Talmud (the Yerushalmi).  ",

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn the introduction to the tractate I explained what the half-shekel is and what it was used for.  Our mishnah teaches that on the first of Adar they would make public announcements telling people to start preparing their half-shekels.  The mishnah also teaches other public events that occur in Adar.",
                    "<b>On the first of Adar they make a public announcement about the shekels and concerning kilayim.</b>  On the first of Adar, the month before Nisan (the month in which Pesah falls) they begin to make announcements reminding people to bring their shekels, or more specifically half-shekels.  They also announce that people should go out to their fields and vineyards to uproot any “kilayim” that may have sprung up.  “Kilayim” are diverse seeds which have sprung up in the same area.",
                    "<b>On the fifteenth: they read the Megillah [Esther] in walled cities, and they fix the roads and the streets and the ritual water baths, and they perform all public duties, and they mark the graves, and [messengers] go forth also concerning kilayim.</b>  The mishnah now begins to teach things that occur, or begin to occur on the fifteenth of the month.  The first thing is that on the fifteenth of the month, people in walled cities read the book of Esther, the Megillah.  We will learn much more about this when we learn Tractate Megillah.  The reason that the mishnah mentions the date upon which it was read in walled cities is that this date coincides with the other things done in the continuation of the mishnah. The second thing is that they begin to fix the public roads and ritual baths because Pesah is coming in one month.  People would need to travel to Jerusalem and purify themselves in order to take part in the pesah sacrifice.  Also, Adar is the beginning of the dry season (actually, it can still rain in Adar).  It would have been difficult to fix the roads when the rains were still coming down. In addition they performed all sorts of other public duties that could not be done during the rainy season. They would mark graves with lime so that priests could see where the graves were and avoid them.  During the winter the lime would wash away. Therefore, during Adar, once the rains had stopped they would reapply the plaster. Above we learned that on the first of Adar they would announce to people that they should go out and check to make sure that there were no kilayim in their fields.  On the fifteenth, they would send out messengers to make sure that this had been done.  We can see that this was an issue of great importance to them.  The rabbis seem to have been especially concerned about kilayim because one cannot tell from looking at picked grain or grapes whether they grew in a field that had kilayim in it.  This is true of other food-related problems as well."

                [
                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nAt the end of yesterday’s mishnah we learned that on the fifteenth of Adar the court would send out agents to uproot kilayim, shoots that have grown from mixed seeds.  In today’s mishnah we learn how this was done.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah said: at first they used to uproot [the kilayim], and throw them down before them. [But] when transgressors increased in number, they used to uproot them and throw them on the roads. [Finally], they decreed that they should make the whole field ownerless.</b> At first the court would merely uproot the kilayim plants to prevent them from continuing to grow.  They didn’t bother throwing them away, but would just uproot them and leave them in their place. The problem with this was that people would use the plants that the court’s agents had uprooted.  If they were not fit for human consumption they would feed them to their animals.  This is prohibited because it is prohibited to derive any benefit from kilayim.  To remedy this, they began to throw the plants out onto the roads where anyone could take them. However, even this was not sufficient.  People did not seem to care that the court’s agents would come around and uproot their plants.  Indeed, they may have even thanked the court for doing their weeding for them!  Therefore the court had to decree that if they found kilayim in someone’s field, they would declare the entire field ownerless.  Basically this is penalizing the person by making him lose his field.  This was a far more effective measure; since people knew they might lose their field they were far more cautious about allowing kilayim to grow."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah returns to dealing with the half-shekel.",
                    "<b>On the fifteenth of [Adar] they would set up tables [of money changers] in the provinces.</b>  The half-shekel had to be given in Israeli currency.  In order to help people exchange their currency they would set up money changer tables in the provinces to change money.  The money changers could also exchange large currency for smaller coins.",
                    "<b>On the twenty-fifth they set them up in the Temple.</b>  As the first of Nisan approached, the time when they would begin to use the shekalim collected from the previous year, they would stop having money changers throughout the land and limit their presence to the Temple.",
                    "<b>When [the tables] were set up in the Temple, they began to exact pledges [from those who had not paid].</b>  At this point, they would begin to take pledges from people who had not yet paid.  A “pledge” means that they would take something away from the person and only return it when the half-shekel had been paid.",
                    "<b>From whom did they exact pledges? From Levites and Israelites, converts and freed slaves, but not women or slaves or minors.</b>  Pledges were not taken from everyone, but rather only from free adult Jewish men (excluding priests, as we shall see below), those who are obligated to give the half-shekel.  They didn’t take pledges from women, slaves or minors because women, slaves and minors are exempt from the half-shekel.  Women are exempt because Exodus 30:12 states, “each man (ish) shall pay a ransom for himself” the word “man” is understood as exempting women.  Slaves are usually in the same category as women so they too are exempt.  Exodus 30 explicitly excludes minors under the age of 20 (Ex. 30:14).",
                    "<b>Any minor on whose behalf his father has begun to pay the shekel, may not discontinue it again.</b>  Sometimes fathers would begin to donate the half-shekel on behalf of their sons, even though they were not obligated to do so.  The mishnah teaches that if they had begun to give the half-shekel, in subsequent years they must continue to do so.",
                    "<b>But they did not exact pledges from the priests, because of the ways of peace.</b>  The only category of free adult male from whom they did not exact a pledge is the priest.  They didn’t do so in order to avoid fights.  Albeck explains that the priests thought that they were exempt from the half-shekel.  Although they are indeed obligated, the court seems not to have wanted to get into a fight with them over the subject.  Tomorrow’s mishnah will deal with the priests obligation to pay the shekel. We might note that if many of the priests were Sadducees and the Sadducees seem to have rejected the whole practice of giving the yearly half-shekel, then we have here evidence of the Pharisees not wanting to provoke a fight with the Sadducees."

                [
                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn this mishnah we see two early tannaim arguing over whether or not a priest donates the half-shekel.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah said: Ben Bukri testified at Yavneh that a priest who paid the shekel is not a sinner.</b>  Ben Bukri assumes that a priest is exempt from the shekel offering.  The midrash which explains this appears below, in section two.  His testimony is that despite the fact that the priest need not donate the half-shekel, if he does donate it he has not transgressed.   We might have thought that person who is not liable to pay the half-shekel may not donate it.  The problem with a voluntary donation of the half-shekel is that public sacrifices must come from the entire public, meaning from the half-shekel.  A voluntary donation may be seen as an individual paying for a public sacrifice.  Ben Bukri testifies that we don’t perceive of the priest’s half-shekel in that way. Rather it is a gift to the community, which belongs to the community as a whole.  As such it may be used to purchase public sacrifices.",
                    "<b>But Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai said to him: not so, but rather a priest who did not pay the shekel was guilty of a sin, only the priests expounded this verse for their own benefit: “And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt, it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:16), since the omer and the two loaves and the showbread are [brought] from our [contributions], how can they be eaten?</b>  Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai reasons the exact opposite from Ben Bukri.  He holds that the priest is liable to donate the half-shekel and if he doesn’t do so, he transgresses in much the same way that any person who doesn’t give the half-shekel transgresses.  The priests tried to use some midrashic reasoning to get out of giving the half-shekel. The Torah states that any minhah, a meal-offering, given by a priest, must be wholly burnt.  The half-shekel is used to purchase certain meal offerings, namely the omer (the barley offering brought between Pesah and Shavuot), the two loaves brought on Shavuot, and the weekly showbread.  All of these are eaten by priests and not burnt.  The priests claim that the fact that these are eaten proves that the priests did not pay for any of them, for had they paid for them they would have had to have been wholly burnt.  Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai says that the priests’ midrash is mistaken.  Only individual minhah offerings of the priest are wholly burnt.  Public minhah offerings paid for partly by priests may be eaten.  Hence the priests are liable to pay the half-shekel. We should note that aside from the technical aspects of this debate, there may be an underlying social/religious issue.  The question is, are the priests a part of the people or are they a separate class, with their own unique relationship to God?  This might be an interesting way of examining Jewish religious leadership in general are leaders a part of the Jewish people, or are they a class on their own.  Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai’s answer would seem to be clear the priests must give their half-shekel, they are part of the Jewish people and not above, or even truly separate from the rest."

                [
                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nMost of this mishnah deals with Gentiles who wish to make donations to the Temple.  We should note that this was a sensitive and realistic issue in the Second Temple Period.  There were some groups of Jews, notably the Dead Sea Sect, which adamantly opposed accepting donations from the Gentiles.  A quote from the book of Ezra which we will see below also seems to express this approach. In contrast, the rabbis are more open to Gentile donations.  In fact, I don’t believe that they were opposed in principle.  Rather they felt that when their understanding of the Torah allowed such donations, it was sanctioned.  The rabbis seem to be trying to walk a fine line to make Jews responsible for the ultimate upkeep of the Temple and yet to not totally exclude Gentiles from participating in what they may have perceived as worship to the one, true, God.",
                    "<b>Even though they said, “they don’t exact pledges from women, slaves or minors, [yet] if they paid the shekel it is accepted from them.</b>  We learned in mishnah three that women, slaves and minors are exempt from paying the half-shekel, and hence pledges are not taken from them to get them to pay their shekels.  In our mishnah we learn that shekels are accepted from them.  As we stated above with regard to the priest, as long as they give the shekel with the intent of it becoming a communal possession, the shekels can be used to buy public sacrifices.  The only problem would be if they gave it thinking that they were making an individual donation for a public sacrifice.  In such a case, their shekels would have to be rejected, since public sacrifices must come from only public money.",
                    "<b>If a non-Jew or a Samaritan paid the shekel they do not accept it from them.</b>  In contrast, shekels given by non-Jews or Samaritans are rejected. This is so that the public sacrifices, which come to afford atonement for the entire Jewish people, should paid for by the Jewish people themselves.  As we shall see below, other sacrifices are accepted from non-Jews.",
                    "<b>And they do not accept from them the bird-offerings of zavin or bird-offerings of zavot or bird-offerings of women after childbirth,</b>  This section refers to sacrifices which a person must bring at the end of their period of impurity.  The Yerushalmi explains that the mishnah here teaches that Samaritans, who are in some matters considered Jews, do not bring these sacrifices.  Assumedly the reason is that they do not count the period of their impurity correctly, and hence they bring the sacrifices at the wrong time.  Gentiles cannot bring these sacrifices because they are not obligated for them.",
                    "<b>Or sin-offerings or guilt-offerings.</b>  There are two different versions of this mishnah and the two differ with regard to whether sin and guilt offerings are accepted.  According to one version they are not accepted from Gentiles or Samaritans because these are sacrifices cannot be donated (see below).  Rather these are two types of atonement offerings incurred by people for various sins, and these laws govern only Jews.  The other version says that guilt and sin offerings are accepted.  According to this version, the line refers only to Samaritans, from whom these offerings are accepted in the hope that they will repent and return to being “real Jews.”",
                    "<b>But vow-offerings and freewill-offerings they do accept from them. This is the general rule: all offerings which can be made as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering they do accept from them, but offerings which cannot be made as a vow-offering or a freewill-offering they do not accept from them.</b>  A “vow offering” is when one says, “I vow to bring an offering.”  A “free-will offering” is when one says, “I vow to bring this animal.”  Both types of sacrifices are accepted from Gentiles and Samaritans.  This halakhah is derived midrashically from Leviticus 22:18, which twice uses the word “ish” (man). The double appearance is taken to mean that these offerings are accepted from both Jews and Gentiles alike.",
                    "<b>And thus it is explicitly stated by Ezra, as it is said: “You have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God” (Ezra 4:3).</b>  In the preceding verses in Ezra some enemies of the Jews come to Zerubbabel and the chiefs of the clans and say, “Let us build with you, since we too worship your God.”  The Jewish leaders respond, “It is not for you and us to build a House to our God, but we alone will build it to the Lord God of Israel.”  From here the rabbis conclude that non-Jews may not participate in the funding of the public sacrifices.  However, as we noted above, other types of sacrifices are accepted from them."

                    "<b>Introduction</b> The rabbis added onto the half-shekel a surcharge which is called a “kalbon.” Rabbi Meir and the other rabbis disagree over the nature of the kalbon and therefore over who has to pay it.  According to Rabbi Meir everyone who gives the shekel has to pay the kalbon.  Rabbi Meir reasons that the kalbon is a surcharge because they coin he is giving is probably not as pure as the coin demanded by the Torah.  Hence, there is always an obligation to give the kalbon. The other sages understand the kalbon to be a surcharge because when he gives a coin they will have to exchange it with a moneychanger. Therefore they hold that anyone who gives his half-shekel in one coin to the Temple need not give the kalbon, because there is no exchange.  If two together give one shekel then the two must add one kalbon, because had they split their coin into two, they would have had to pay the moneychanger.  The sages decreed that the money saved by not giving it to the moneychanger should go to the Temple. In our mishnah and in the following one we learn some details about who pays the kalbon.",
                    "<b>The following are liable [to pay] the kalbon (surcharge): Levites and Israelites and converts and freed slaves; but not priests or women or slaves or minors.</b>  This is the same list that appeared above in mishnah three with regard to taking pledges.  The kalbon was paid only by those from whom they took pledges in order to collect the half-shekel.  The kalbon was not taken from those who don’t owe the half-shekel in the first place.  The one exception may be the priests, whom according to our mishnah do not pay the kalbon. Albeck explains that the priests were lenient on themselves.  Another explanation might be that this mishnah goes according to Ben Bukri in mishnah four who said that priests do not have to give the half-shekel. Finally, there are some manuscripts that do not have the word “priest” in this mishnah.",
                    "<b>If a man paid the shekel on behalf of a priest, or on behalf of a woman, or on behalf of a slave, or on behalf of a minor, he is exempt.</b>  Since the person for whom the shekel is being paid is exempt, the one who pays it on their behalf is also exempt.",
                    "<b>If a man paid the shekel on his own behalf and on behalf of his fellow he is liable for one kalbon. Rabbi Meir says: two kalbons.</b>  The first opinion is that of the sages, which I explained in the introduction.  They are only liable for one kalbon because only one exchange was made.  Rabbi Meir holds that everyone is always individually liable for a kalbon.  Hence, if one person pays on behalf of him and another person, he must add two kalbons.",
                    "<b>If one gave a sela and received a shekel, he is liable to pay two kalbons.</b>  In this case a person gives the Temple treasurer a sela, which is the value of a Torah shekel.  This is twice the amount he needs to give.  He takes back in change a “mishnaic shekel”, which is a Torah half-shekel. In this case he must pay a kalbon for the shekel he gave and for the shekel he took, since both exchanges carry surcharges.  We see from here that high banking fees are no modern invention!"

A silver ma'ah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: half a ma'ah.</b><br>This mishnah continues to discuss the kalbon, the extra surcharge paid with the shekel.<br>Section one:  If someone pays the shekel for a friend as a gift, the rabbis did not make him pay the kalbon as well.  The same is true, as we shall see below, if a father pays the kalbon on behalf of his son.  However, one who pays the shekel on someone else’s behalf as a loan does have to pay the kalbon.<br>Section two:  This section refers to two different types of partnerships between brothers who have inherited from their father.  The first type is when they have already divided up the inheritance and then pooled their money together to form a business partnership.  In such a case they are liable for the kalbon as are all partners who pay each other’s kalbon, but they are exempt from paying the tithe on beasts (domesticated animals) since partners do not pay this tithe on their shared animals.  The second partnership is one in which they have not yet divided up the inheritance. In such a case the money is treated as if it still belonged to one person, their father.  They are liable for the tithe but they are exempt from the kalbon, since this is similar to as case in which a father pays the shekel on his son’s behalf.<br>Section three:  Rabbi Meir holds that the kalbon is a ma’ah, which is 1/12 of a half-shekel.  This matches Rabbi Meir’s understanding of the kalbon as compensation for the non-pure elements which are customarily put into silver coins.  This ma’ah is supposed to increase the silver of the shekel so that it now reaches the value of the Torah’s half-shekel. The sages, however, hold that the kalbon is in place of a fee paid to the moneychanger.  The fee is a lesser amount, only half a ma’ah."

This was to prevent people from being able to pull coins out (like mailboxes, for those of you who remember when we used to send real letters).  Just as they had these types of chests in the Temple, they also had them outside the Temple in the provinces.  This made collection much easier.",

Three times a year the Temple treasurers would count up the shekels that had already been collected and they would start spending them on buying sacrifices (see below 3:1).  When reckoning the shekels, they would also count shekels which they knew were on their way from the provinces (called creative accounting).  So if the messenger loses the shekels after this appropriation has already been made, the townspeople who sent their money get credit.  The messenger then must make an oath to the treasurers that he did not steal the money himself.  However, if the money is lost or stolen before the appropriation is made then the townspeople do not get credit and they must send new shekels.   In this case, the messenger swears to them that he did not steal the money himself.

If the shekel had already been counted in the Temple’s appropriation (and an animal purchased with that money and sacrificed, see below), then he is guilty of sacrilege.  Sacrilege means that one has misappropriated funds or property which belongs to the Temple.  Since this shekel had already been counted as belonging to the Temple and indeed had already been used, his action counts as sacrilege.  He must now bring a special sacrifice and restore the value of that which he misappropriated (a shekel) plus another fifth.",

He then tried to use that money to pay his shekel. Again the mishnah teaches that if the appropriation had already been made and if the shekel had been used to buy a sacrifice then he is guilty of sacrilege.

The bird-offerings mentioned here are brought by men or women who have had abnormal genital discharge (zavim and zavot, see above 1:5) or by women after childbirth.  Money set aside for any of these offerings or for a sin-offering or a guilt-offering must be used to purchase freewill offerings. They can’t be used for other bird-offerings, sin-offerings or guilt-offerings because these can only be purchased for the sake of a specific sin or abnormal discharge.  However, the surplus is still sacred because these offerings don’t have a fixed amount (see above mishnah 2).<br>Sections three-five:  In all of these cases the extra money is used to buy another of the same type of sacrifice.<br>Section six:  The extra money which was set aside for a pesah cannot be used as a pesah, because the surplus is only created when the holiday is already over.  Rather the surplus is used to buy a wellbeing offering.  In Pesahim we saw that the pesah is a type of wellbeing offering (see Pesahim 9:6-7).<br>Section seven:  If charity collectors set aside money to buy nazirite offerings for nazirites who cannot afford to pay their offerings, then the surplus is used to buy other nazirite offerings.  However, if the money is set aside for a specific nazirite it cannot be used to buy an offering for a different nazirite. Rather the surplus is used to purchase freewill offerings.<br>Section eight:  Obviously, surplus charity should be used for more charity.  However, if there is money set aside for a particular poor person, and there is surplus from that money, it too must go to that poor person.  The charity collector may not say to himself, “That poor person doesn’t need all of that money.  I’ll give the rest to someone else.”  Rather, if the donor directed it to one person, the entire amount must be given to that person.<br>Section nine:  Surplus from money collected to redeem captives is used to redeem other captives.  However, if money was collected to redeem a specific captive, the surplus goes directly to that captive.<br>Section ten:  Surplus money collected to bury the dead is used to bury other dead people.  However, if the money was collected to bury a specific dead person there are three different opinions as to what to do with it.  According to the first opinion, the money goes to the dead person’s inheritors.  According to Rabbi Meir, it is forbidden to use it at all it must go untouched until Elijah comes.

I have translated “A half-month before” based on the Talmud. The mishnah itself says only “Before”, but uses a word which implies that this must occur at least a half-month before.  The word “threshing floors” is borrowed from tithes for grain.  The meaning is that in these three periods it becomes forbidden to eat any animal until every tenth animal has been tithed.  The tithed animal still belongs to its owners, but its blood must be sprinkled on the altar and its meat eaten in Jerusalem.  It seems likely to me that Rabbi Akiva said that animals were tithed before the holidays so that people would bring them to Jerusalem when they made their festival pilgrimages.",

The first of Sivan is only 7 days before Shavuot.  He seems to give more time because there is not a lot of time between Pesah and Shavuot in which animals might be born.  The third tithe is at the end of Av, because Ben Azai holds that animals born in Elul are tithed separately.",

The second tithing period is on the first of Sivan, the same as Ben Azai. The third tithing period is on the twenty-ninth of Elul. The mishnah explains that they would have said the first of Tishre but one can’t tithe on the first of Tishre because it is a holiday, namely Rosh Hashanah.

For it is one’s duty to seem be free of blame before others as before God, as it is said: “And you shall be guiltless before the Lord and before Israel” (Numbers 32:22), and it says: “And you will find favor and good understanding in the eyes of God and man” (Proverbs 3:4).</b>  The person who went in to count the coins and make the appropriation could not wear any piece of clothing that would cause others to suspect that he might have stolen something.  This could only lead to bad results if he grew poor they would suspect him of being punished for having stolen the shekels, if he grew rich they would suspect of being rich because of the stolen money. The mishnah finishes with an important moral note.  A person must carefully guard his public reputation, even if in his heart he knows that he is not sinning and even if he knows that in God’s all-seeing eyes he is not sinning.  This is especially true of a person with a position of public responsibility.  It is not enough to just be honest, one must also give the outward appearance of honesty as well.  I believe that this is an important life’s lesson.  A person’s reputation of honesty is important both for the moral character of that person himself and for the proper functioning of society."

[But after] the third appropriation he would not cover [what was left]. [And why would he cover?]  Lest he should forget and make a [fresh] appropriation from shekels from which had already been appropriated.</b>  After the first appropriation, done at Pesah time, he would cover the left over shekels so that they would not be used for the next appropriation.  The new shekels that were collected during the next period would be placed on top of the leather coverings. Similarly, after the second appropriation, he would cover the remaining already appropriated shekels with a leather covering and new shekels would go on top.  However, after the third appropriation, done at Sukkot time, he would not cover the shekels.  The mishnah then explains why he would cover after each appropriation.  The reason is that we don’t want shekels that have already been counted in one appropriation to count towards another appropriation.  Doing so would be an ancient version of “cooking the books.”  The leather covers were placed there to prevent this from happening.  Since there is no appropriation after the third one, there was no need to cover the remaining coins. A different explanation is offered by the Rambam.  He holds that there were three large baskets in the chamber from which they would fill three smaller baskets, Aleph, Bet and Gimmel.  At the first appropriation they would fill up the small basket with the Aleph on it from the first large basket and then cover the first large basket.  They would then fill the small basket with the letter Bet on it from the second large basket and cover the second large basket.  They would then fill the third basket from the third large basket but they would not cover that basket so that when the next appropriation time would arrive (fifteen days before Shavuot), they would know to begin filling the small basket with the Aleph from the third large basket.  In this way, in the space of the year, each small basket would be filled from each larger basket. There is yet another explanation, one which Albeck prefers.  That is that the question is not “and why would he cover [the first two]” but rather “why didn’t he cover the third?”  The answer is that they would leave the third uncovered because the third appropriation is not really finished until the end of the year.  They would leave the remaining coins uncovered to remind themselves to continue to appropriate from them and from new ones that would come in after Sukkot and not the coins underneath which had already been appropriated.",

The one performing the appropriation would at the first appropriation say, “Behold this appropriation is from the Land of Israel for all of Israel” and similarly for the next two.  The order is the order of proximity to Jerusalem.  It can be assumed that the people who live in Israel will get their shekels to the Temple first, the people who live in the bordering areas will come next and finally those living in Babylonian and Persia will bring their shekels."

The Temple’s treasurers can sell the extra seah and with the profit pay for the ministering vessels.",

The incense for 365 days and for three extra incense offerings on Yom Kippur was prepared ahead of time.  The lunar year is only 354 years, so the extra incense was to be saved up for the leap year, when they would add a month.  The problem is that from the first of Nisan the incense had to be offered using the new shekels.

First they would separate an amount of incense that would be used to pay the wages of those who make the incense.  Then they would redeem that incense with money set aside to pay those craftsmen.

The craftsmen would have their wages, and the incense was bought with new shekels.

That mishnah discussed animals and not wines, oils and birds as does our mishnah.  Animals dedicated as sacrifices can be, under certain circumstances, redeemed.  If the animal becomes blemished, it is redeemed with money and the money becomes sacred and is used to buy another sacrifice.  Since the money becomes sacred, when these animals are sold it is as if the mitzvah has been already performed and the money can be used for the repair of the Temple.  In contrast, wine, oil and birds cannot be redeemed with money. Therefore, when they are sold the money itself does not become holy.

These grain offerings accompany certain animal sacrifices:  an offering of well-being, a burnt offering and the sin and guilt offerings of a leper.  The amount of grain, oil and wine would vary depending upon the animal used in the sacrifice.

Since the leper brings three sheep he therefore brings three times the amount of flour, oil and water that is brought for one sheep (see the chart).  In addition he brings one extra log (a small measure=1/12 of a hin) of oil which was placed on his right earlobe, right thumb and right big toe (Leviticus 14:15-18).

The only way which is preferred over secrecy is to help a person earn his own living.<br>The mishnah is clear and doesn’t seem to need any explanation.  However, I will offer some historical commentary.<br>The Temple in Jerusalem was clearly a repository of wealth, as were most Temples in the ancient world.  When Josephus describes how Antiochus came to pillage Jerusalem (the events that preceded the Hasmonean revolution) he writes (Antiquities of the Jews XII, chapter 5, section four:<br>“The king came up to Jerusalem, and, pretending peace, he got possession of the city by treachery; at which time he spared not so much as those that admitted him into it, on account of the riches that lay in the temple; but, led by his covetous inclination, (for he saw there was in it a great deal of gold, and many ornaments that had been dedicated to it of very great value,) and in order to plunder its wealth, he ventured to break the league he had made. So he left the temple bare, and took away the golden candlesticks, and the golden altar [of incense], and table [of shew-bread], and the altar [of burnt-offering]; and did not abstain from even the veils, which were made of fine linen and scarlet. He also emptied it of its secret treasures, and left nothing at all remaining.”<br>The secret treasures referred to here may be similar to that which Josephus describes.  What interests me, beyond the sheer parallel between the Mishnah and Josephus, is that the rabbis assume that some of these treasures must have gone to tzedakah.  According to the rabbis, the Temple must have at least partially functioned as a repository where people could give money secretly.  In the rabbinic mind, the Temple’s treasures could not just have been designated to make its leaders wealthier or to pay for more ornament decorations. The money must have gone to the poor as well.  I do not know if this is historically accurate but to me it makes no difference.  What the Mishnah is telling us is that our religious centers, be it the Temple or the synagogue, must also be points of tzedakah, and not just tzedakah for the organization itself, but tzedakah for the poor.  The Temple/synagogue is the exchange center by which Jews can give charity secretly."

The Fuel Gate was used to bring in the wood used to fuel the altar’s fires.  The firstborn animals were brought in through the Firstborn Animal’s Gate (should be obvious, but still..). The mishnah offers two explanations for why the Water Gate was called as such. The first explanation is that this is where the water libation, offered on Sukkot (we will learn this eventually in Sukkah 4:9), was brought into the Temple.  The second is that in the future, when clean living water flows out of the Temple and cleanses the salty water of the Dead Sea, the water will begin to trickle forth from this gate (see Ezekiel 47).

From this chest the shekels would later be brought into the chamber.<br>Section two:  The “old shekels” chest was for people who failed to bring their shekels during the year.<br>Sections three and four:  The “bird-offerings” are turtledoves (sorry, no partridge in a pear tree).  The “young pigeons for burnt offerings” are, as might be obvious young pigeons.  The sages dispute what these bird offerings are used for. According to Rabbi Judah both the bird-offerings and the young pigeons are used for burnt offerings.  He holds that people who put money into both of these chests are bringing voluntary offerings, and voluntary bird offerings are only offered as burnt offerings.  If someone needed to bring a mandated bird offering (such as a leper or a woman after childbirth) she didn’t put the money in the box but rather gave the offering directly to a priest.<br>The other sages agree that the box marked “young pigeons for burnt-offerings” goes exclusively for burnt offerings.  This box, and only this box, was where people who wanted to make voluntary bird offerings put their money.  The box marked “bird offerings” is intended for those who are obligated to bring a pair of birds, one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering.  There is actually an entire tractate (Tractate Kinim) about these bird offerings.<br>Section five:  This was for people who wished to donate wood to fuel the altar.<br>Section six:  For people who wished to donate the frankincense.<br>Section seven:  One who said, “Behold I am donating gold” would bring golden dinarim (a type of coin) and put them in this box. The dinarim would then be used to buy gold to make various coverings for the Holy of Holies.  The word “kapporet” in the Torah refers to the cover of the Ark, but here in this mishnah it refers to all golden coverings.<br>Section eight:  There were six other chests upon which was inscribed “freewill offerings.”  This was parallel to the six things listed above in 2:5 whose surplus goes to freewill offerings.

Thus the two verses are fulfilled: a guilt offering for the Lord and a guilt offering for the priests, and it says:  “Money brought as a guilt offering or as a sin offering was not deposited in the House of the Lord; it went to the priests” (II Kings 12:17).</b>  In this section we read a midrash which explains how we derive the halakhah in the previous section, that the priests receive the hides and the flesh is totally burnt.  This is justified through a midrashic reading of Leviticus 5:19, which I have translated to facilitate its midrashic understanding.  This verse seems to state that a guilt offering goes to God like a burnt offering, whereas we know from other places that the guilt offering goes to the priests. Yehoyada solves this riddle by stating that any surplus from money dedicated to purchasing a sin or guilt offering is used to buy burnt offerings, the flesh goes to the altar and the hides go to the priest.  This is the now the interpretation of the verse in II Kings 12 which contains an extended explanation of how Yehoyada would collect money for the Temple.  Verse 17 states that “Money brought as a guilt offering or as a sin offering was not deposited in the House of the Lord; it went to the priests.”  This cannot be explained to simply mean that money set aside to purchase guilt or sin offerings went directly to the priests, since they had to buy the sacrifices. Rather the explanation is that if money was left over after the requisite sacrifices were purchased, they would buy with it burnt-offerings as voluntary offerings, and they would keep the hides for themselves."

However, if he didn’t send the libation offerings, and it is difficult to reach him in order to ask him to do so, the libations are made with public funds.

We should also note that the idea of gentiles sending sacrifices to the Temple in Jerusalem is an interesting phenomenon, and one that is described in other places.  These may have been admirers of Jews, or perhaps pluralistic idol-worshippers who wished to “cover all of their bets” and therefore offered sacrifices to all sorts of Gods, including the God of the Jews.",

In other words, his relatives from before he converted do not inherit his estate.  If he dies and he leaves a sacrifice and libations, then the libations are offered with the sacrifice.  However, if he doesn’t leave money for the libations, the libations are provided for by public funds.  If the person who died had inheritors, as do all Jews, then the inheritors are liable to provide the funds for the libations.",

If the High Priest dies and they have not yet appointed a new High Priest to take his place, this grain offering is provided for by public funds.  Rabbi Judah disagrees and holds that the offering comes from the money that the High Priest’s inheritors get from him.  Both Rabbi Judah and the other sages agree that in this case an entire ephah is sacrificed in the morning and evening, instead of the usual half-ephah.  This is discussed in greater depth in Mishnah Menahot 4:5."

This is because in Jerusalem many people eat sacred food, which needs to be eaten in purity.  In contrast, outside of Jerusalem we must be concerned lest the spit is unclean.

At these times the pure people walk on the sides of the road to avoid the impure people who are walking in the middle of the road.  Hence, spit found in the middle of the road is impure whereas spit found on the sides is pure.  The opposite is true during the time of the festivals, when most people are pure.

This term refers to something that has become unclean by virtue of its contact with something that is a “principal uncleanness”.  From the Torah (deoraita), only liquids which come into contact with “derived uncleanness” are made unclean.  “Derived uncleannesses” do not cause things or people to become unclean.  Therefore, the curtain in this case has been made impure with only a low level of impurity, one that is considered to be “derabbanan” of rabbinic origin. The rabbis nevertheless required that it be immersed but they allowed it to be immersed in the mikveh (ritual pool) that was in the precincts of the Temple. Furthermore, it could be brought back again immediately.  If it had contracted “deoraita” toraitic impurity, it could not be used again until nightfall, as we shall see in the next clause.",

He writes:\n“But then this house, as it was divided into two parts, the inner part was lower than the appearance of the outer, and had golden doors of fifty-five cubits altitude, and sixteen in breadth; but before these doors there was a veil of equal largeness with the doors. It was a Babylonian curtain, embroidered with blue, and fine linen, and scarlet, and purple, and of a contexture that was truly wonderful. Nor was this mixture of colors without its mystical interpretation, but was a kind of image of the universe; for by the scarlet there seemed to be enigmatically signified fire, by the fine flax the earth, by the blue the air, and by the purple the sea; two of them having their colors the foundation of this resemblance; but the fine flax and the purple have their own origin for that foundation, the earth producing the one, and the sea the other. This curtain had also embroidered upon it all that was mystical in the heavens, excepting that of the [twelve] signs, representing living creatures.”",

There is a description of the Tabernacle’s curtain in Exodus 26:1. There we learn that it is made of four types of thread:  blue, purple, scarlet and fine linen (see also Josephus above).

On the eve of Yom Kippur they would bring in a new curtain and take out the old one.

We have finished Shekalim. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Shekalim is a tractate dedicated to the financial operation of the Temple in Jerusalem.  It is interesting that the Mishnah sees this subject as being as worthy of study as any other topic, including the holidays, Shabbat, marital law etc.  The financial support of the Temple is a commandment, one to be fulfilled properly and with a sense of its great import.  Indeed, by financially supporting the Temple, Jews throughout the world were able to participate in its services.  I am not USCJ’s fundraiser, but I would be amiss if I did not use this brief opportunity to thank those who support the Mishnah Yomit project and the other projects of the USCJ. May you continue to show your support by learning and by continuing to help others to learn as well. Most importantly, congratulations on learning another tractate of Mishnah.  May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more! Tomorrow we begin Yoma."
