        "Introduction": [
            "Most of tractate Shabbat goes into great detail as to what type of work is prohibited on Shabbat.  There is not a lot of information about this in the Torah itself.  Indeed the only four activities specifically prohibited in the Torah are plowing and reaping (Exodus 34:21), fire (Exodus 35:3) and gathering wood (Numbers 15:32).  The paucity of verses and the volume of rabbinic halakhah led the rabbis to conclude that “the laws of Shabbat are like mountains hanging by a thread” (Hagigah 1:8).  There is a little bit of information in the prophets about the observance of Shabbath, but this does not add up to much.  However, from the literature that remains from the Second Temple period it seems that Jews were very stringent about the observance of the Sabbath.  From Josephus and the books of the Maccabees we learn that some Jews did not even want to engage in battle on Shabbat, and rather than do so gave up their lives, until Mattathias taught them that engaging in battle to save one’s life was permitted.  The Book of Jubilees, a rewritten version of Genesis popular among certain groups of Second Temple Jews is very stringent on Sabbath observance.  So too were the groups that composed the Dead Sea scrolls.  However, in this period the concept of prohibited “work” on the Sabbath was somewhat ill-defined.   In contrast, the Rabbis define “work” in great detail.  There are 39 categories of work, and anything that is considered to be prohibited from the Torah must fit somehow into one of these categories.  These will not be listed until chapter 7, mishnah two.  These are called “avot” or arch-categories of work.  Anything derived from one of these arch-categories is either an arch-category in and of itself or is a “toldah”, a derivative.  Anything that does not fit into one of these categories, and yet is still prohibited is considered to only be prohibited from “rabbinic law”—derabbanan— and not from “toraitic law”—deoraita.  I should emphasize that a law’s being “derabbanan” does not necessarily make it less important.  It only means that the rabbis could not somehow tie it into one of the 39 categories. These laws are also called “shvut” which means “rest”.  The rabbis prohibited certain activities so that a person would be able to rest on Shabbat.  ",
            "There are some terms we should know before we begin learning.   1.  Liable—this means that a person who does a certain activity has transgressed a biblical prohibition.  S/he is liable to either bring a sacrifice if the transgression was done without intention, or for the death penalty if done with intention. We should not get ourselves caught up with “did this really happen/did the rabbis execute people for Shabbat infractions?”  The point of “liable” is merely to define what the prohibitions are.  Their enforcement is a totally different issue. 2.  Exempt—this almost always means that the activity is prohibited but that one who has done so has not transgressed a biblical prohibition. 3.  Permitted—this means that an activity is completely permissible. ",
            "A couple of words of warning before we begin learning.  Shabbat observance still plays a major role in the life of observant Jews.  The prohibitions that we learn about in the Mishnah are the foundations of an incredibly complex system of halakhah that is codified throughout the ages.  The system is perhaps the most complex areas of halakhah still observed today.  Learning the Mishnah is not equivalent to learning how halakhah is observed, certainly not in its minutae of detail.  Halakhah is not derived directly from the Mishnah, but rather from the Talmud and from its codifiers.  Hence, while learning the Mishnah we should refrain from expecting a direct correlation to how the Shabbat is observed today.  Furthermore, I am not a “posek” an arbitrator of Jewish law.  I will try not to answer many questions of modern halakhah in this forum and instead will refer you to other sources and especially to your local rabbi.   Second, I realize that people reading this commentary have different levels of observance.  However, this realization will not impact my commentary on the mishnah, at least not regularly.  Whether you personally “keep Shabbat” or don’t, the rabbis of the Mishnah firmly believed it to be mandatory.   Thirdly, the Conservative movement has in the past made certainly leniencies regarding Shabbat observance, most famously allowing under certain circumstances driving to synagogue on Shabbat.  This teshuvah (responsa) will not be relevant to our learning of the Mishnah.  Even those rabbis who supported this responsa would agree that a simple reading of the sources would lead to prohibiting driving on the Sabbath, mostly because of the prohibition of fire. Fourthly, we should remember that “work” has a specific legal definition.  It is not a nebulous idea but carefully defined through exhaustive definitions.  A person who says that driving to the golf course and enjoying a game of golf, or going shopping, is not breaking Shabbat because to him/her these activities are not “work” may be stating a subjective truth, but it is a truth that does not fit into the more objective and impersonal halakhic system.   The famous example is that you can lift a heavy piece of furniture in your house and you have not performed a prohibited labor, but if you lift a feather outside and carry it four cubits you have. Finally, the Mishnah talks almost exclusively of prohibitions.  It is my firm belief that the rabbis did not see the Sabbath only as a day of prohibitions, but also as an opportunity—an opportunity to pray, to study, to rejoice and to be with the people who one wants to be with.  These other aspects just were not as fruitful for halakhic material and hence are rarely discussed in the Mishnah.  Nevertheless, if Shabbat is to be an integral part of one’s life, it must be regarded not only as a day of things one can’t do, but a day of wonderful opportunities.  It is a time to refrain and thereby allow ourselves to experience the joy of just being. "

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nTractate Shabbat begins with a formulaic teaching about the prohibition of carrying.  The remainder of the chapter discusses preparations before Shabbat, but it seems that the Mishnah’s editors wanted to begin with a mishnah that contains the formula “two which are four”.  This is the same way that tractate Shevuoth began, and it seems that this type of opening was often preferred by the Mishnah.  Indeed, Abraham Goldberg (whose Hebrew critical commentary on Shabbat I will use from time to time published by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America) notes that about half of the tractates of the Mishnah begin with numbers or an issue related to numbers. Goldberg also believes that opening the tractate with a mishnah concerning carrying something from one domain to another was intended as a polemic against the Sadducees who did not agree with the Pharisees in all of the details of these laws.\nThe prohibition of carrying will be further discussed later on in chapter five and will continue to be discussed through chapter eleven.",
                    "The mishnah lists eight slightly different scenarios in which an object is brought from outside in the public domain to inside the house, the private domain.  These scenarios can be divided twice.  In the first four examples a person has performed a complete action, taking something from one domain and bringing into another and is therefore liable.  In two of these cases the object is brought in and in two it is taken out.  In the second four cases, the two people share in bringing the object in or taking it out and hence they are both exempt (remember that this does not mean that this is permitted.)  These cases can also be divided into two subcategories. The mishnah probably uses the example of a poor person standing outside and a householder inside because this is a realistic situation and it will be easier to remember.",

Rather the householder took it out of his hands.  Both are exempt even though together they have performed a forbidden act of work.    We now learn that in order to be liable the person must uproot something from one domain and put it down in another domain.  One is not liable for half of an activity.",

Our mishnah deals with things that one shouldn’t do once the time for the afternoon prayer, minhah, has arrived.  The problem is that if one becomes engaged with one of these activities, he may become swept away and forget to pray minhah.\nThese laws apply not only to the day before Shabbat, but to any day of the week.\nThe minhah referred to here is from the time of 9 1/2 hours, the day being divided into 12 daylight hours.  So on a day where daylight begins at 6 AM and ends at 6 PM, minhah is from 3:30 in the afternoon. In the Northern Hemisphere the hours will be longer in the summer months and shorter during the winter.  We should note that one can also pray minhah at an earlier time of day, from 6 1/2 hours.",

Therefore, even as nightfall draws near, he should take his needle out of his coat where he typically stores it, lest he forget and accidentally carry it on the Sabbath. Similarly, a scribe should not go out on the Sabbath eve with his quill. Both of these things, the scribe’s quill and the tailor’s needle are small items that can easily be carried without a person knowing.  Therefore, he should make sure he puts them away before the Sabbath.  In essence, this is part of his Shabbat preparation.",

It is brought here because the nature of the halakhah is similar to the nature of the other halakhot.  They are all “gezerot” that is prohibitions created to prevent a situation which might cause a person to transgress.  A person should not check his clothes for lice or fleas or read by candlelight on Shabbat lest he tilt the candle to bring more oil to the wick an activity considered to be prohibited due to the prohibition of lighting a fire.",

The Palestinian Talmud explains that children want the candle to go out so that they won’t have to read anymore, hence they won’t tilt it.  Their teacher, the hazzan (today the word is used to refer to the cantor, but in the Mishnah it has a different meaning), may also help them read with the candlelight.  However, he must not use the candle for his own reading.

A zav and a zavah are a man and woman who have abnormal genital flows.  They are both impure.  A pure person should not eat together with a zav or a zavah because the zav or zavah will cause the food they share to become impure.  Seemingly, there should be no problem with a zav eating with a zavah, because they are both impure.  However, in order to prevent people from becoming accustomed to eating with zavim, even this is prohibited."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah does not actually teach any halakhah.  Rather it places the halakhot which we learned above in an historical context.",
                    "<b>And these are of halakhot which they stated in the upper chamber of Hananiah ben Hezekiah ben Gurion, when they went up to visit him. They took a count, and Bet Shammai outnumbered Beth Hillel and on that day they enacted eighteen measures.</b> This mishnah begins by teaching that the halakhot which were taught in the previous several mishnayot were stated on a famous, somewhat legendary and obscure, day in the history of the rabbis when the Sages visited the upper chamber of Hananiah ben Hezekiah ben Gurion. According to the Rambam, the “eighteen measures” mentioned in section two refer to eighteen halakhot stated from the beginning of the tractate until this point.  According to this interpretation, these were eighteen prohibitions about which Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel agreed. Mishnah 1 lists eight things, and there are five in both mishnayot 2 and 3 (these could be counted in different ways).  The Rambam holds that on that day they made eighteen enactments, which are not listed in our mishnah.  They also disagreed over eighteen issues, and thirteen of these will be listed in the upcoming mishnayot.  The remainder of the disagreements are listed elsewhere. There are several other ways to understand this mishnah, but the Rambam’s seems to be straightforward.  Some explain that the mishnah does not refer to those things halakhoth that are found in the above mishnayot but that it refers to a list preserved in the Talmud. However, we understand the mishnah, we should note how unusual it is.  Rarely do mishnayoth provide us with information about where or when they were taught.  Although we cannot be sure of what happened on that day in the upper chamber, it certainly was a day that became legendary in the mind of the rabbis."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe next four mishnayot contain disputes between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel over things that can be done before the Sabbath.\nMost of the disputes revolve around one central issue:  can a person’s vessels perform work for them on the Sabbath?  It is clear that a person herself cannot perform a forbidden act of work on the Sabbath; the debate is whether a person can set in motion a process which will cause work to be done on the Sabbath.  Today it is clear to us that this is permitted.  For instance, I can set a timer on my clock and it can go on on Shabbat and light my house.  Bet Shammai, however, would say that such an act is forbidden.\nWe should note, the it seems that the sect of Jews who lived in Qumran and produced the Dead Sea Scrolls probably held like Bet Shammai.  According to this understanding, work may not be done for a Jew on the Sabbath.  The verse from the Ten Commandments which reads, “Six days you shall labor and do all your work” (Exodus 20:9) is interpreted to mean that all of a person’s work must be done within six day. In contrast, the Hillelites would hold that a Jew may not perform work on the Sabbath.  They interpret the verse to mean that a person can do work for only six days, not that all of a person’s work must be done in six days.  Although these positions might seem similar, they are based on different understandings of the Sabbath and indeed of halakhah in general.",

According to Bet Shammai it is forbidden to start such a process on Friday unless the person can sure that she can complete the process before Shabbat.  As we learned above in the introduction, Bet Shammai forbids a person from having her “things” work for her on Shabbat.  Bet Hillel permits this."

Since the prohibition of putting something into an oven on Friday was only “derabbanan”—of rabbinic origin—and intended to prevent a person from committing a transgression of biblical law, there are cases where this prohibition may be suspended.

Today’s mishnah relates an exception to this rule:  the Passover sacrifice.  The reason that one is not allowed to put meat into an oven is that we are concerned lest on Shabbat itself she come to rake the coals in order to speed up the cooking, which is prohibited on Shabbat.  However, in this case, since people eat the passover sacrifice in a group setting, we are not concerned that one of them will rake the coals, because others will stop her.  These people are engaged in fulfilling a commandment and it is unlikely that they would transgress a commandment at this time.  In addition, because of the quantity of people who had to sacrifice their passover sacrifices, not everybody could roast theirs before the Shabbat began.  Hence the usual restrictions did not apply.",

Today, with electric lights in abundance we no longer appreciate the function of a simple candle on Friday eve.  In the time of the Mishnah, on most nights people would have gone to sleep at nightfall.  It was just too expensive to use up oil for light on normal occasions.  On Friday night they lit candles, stayed up late, ate a festive meal and studied Torah.\nMost of the chapter deals with the technical details of lighting wicks, oils, lamps, etc.",

The reason that we do not light with these types of wicks is that they don’t absorb the oil well, and someone might tilt the lamp on Shabbat to try to get more oil on the wick.  Such tilting is prohibited because it is like lighting a fire.  Also, since they are not good wicks they might go out, forcing the family to sit in the dark.",

The exception is terumah oil which must be burned. This refers to terumah oil which has been made impure and therefore has to be burned.  It is prohibited to burn unclean sacrifices or terumah on Shabbat and on holidays. The final debate is on whether all types of tallow are prohibited or just tallow that has not been melted."

We should note that he does this before Shabbat; during Shabbat it would clearly be strictly forbidden since this is considered to be the forbidden work of “kindling”.  The problem is that since this is a vessel separate from the lamp itself, a person may think that it is permitted to take from it and use the oil.

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah provides a quite strongly worded exhortation to women to be scrupulous in the observation of three mitzvoth with which they are strongly associated:  lighting Shabbat candles, separating hallah (a percentage of dough which has to be taken from all bread) and niddah menstrual purity.  The mishnah says that women die in childbirth for not observing these mitzvoth correctly.\nI should add a personal note.  Loss of life is always difficult, and a woman’s death while giving birth is probably one of the most difficult losses a husband and his and her family could experience. Thankfully, the number of women who die in childbirth is drastically lower in the modern western world than it was in the past.  In the time of the Mishnah, it would have been fairly common. The rabbis were struggling to understand why so many women died while giving birth.  This must have been especially difficult for them since having children was on of their most important values.  While we may have difficulties with their answer, and I don’t think that we should go around saying that people die for non-observance of commandments, we nevertheless can appreciate the difficult theological problem with which the rabbis were trying to cope.\nFinally, lest you think that the rabbis “had it out for women” the Talmud discusses at great length all types of travails that afflict the world and why they come to the world.  The idea that people are punished for sins is normative biblical theology, with no special connection to women.",

By sinning she extinguished the light of the world and therefore she is commanded in lighting the Shabbat candles.  She lost the “hallah” of the world by causing the death of Adam, who was the “hallah” of the Garden of Eden; therefore she is commanded in the laws of hallah."

Tithes may not be separated on Shabbat and therefore food which has not been tithed will not be able to be eaten on Shabbat. He should also ask if the “eruv” has been set up.  There are two types of eruvin (the plural of eruv): one which allows a person to go further out of the city than he would otherwise be allowed to go and one which allows a person to carry things in places where it would normally be prohibited.  The tractate which follows Shabbat is tractate Eruvin so we will reserve in-depth discussion of these issues until later.  Setting up both types of eruvin is an important part of Shabbat preparation.

It is forbidden to tithe produce which we know has not been tithed.  Tithes are part of a forbidden labor called “completing” something’s preparation (metaken).  Similarly, immersing an impure vessel in a mikveh is considered completing its preparation and is forbidden.  Finally, if the candles have not yet been lit, they do not light them.  All three of these activities are prohibited by the Torah (deoraita) and hence cannot be done even during twilight.",

Since the entire obligation is only a rabbinic stringency, the rabbis allowed it to be done during twilight, although not on Shabbat.  One can still set up an eruv.  Finally, it is permitted to cover hot food with something that will maintain the food’s warmth.  On Shabbat it is forbidden to do so lest by doing so she cooks, an activity which is prohibited.

The general rule is that the rabbis allowed storage in something that would preserve the heat but not in something that would increase the heat.

When storage is prohibited it is prohibited even if she stores the dish before Shabbat begins.",

Wearing jewelry on Shabbat would not be considered carrying and therefore it should be permitted.

The Talmud connects this small discursion to the previous section’s prohibition.

In both talmuds they debate whether he wears the sandal on his wounded or healthy foot.<br>Section three:  The sages debated whether or not tefillin are worn on Shabbat (today we don’t wear tefillin on Shabbat).  For those who held that tefillin are not worn on Shabbat it was obvious that he can’t wear them out into the public domain.  Since they are prohibited there is no reason to wear them around.

While the sages would not deny that weapons are necessary in times of war, they should not be worn as mere decorations, meant to make a person look tougher.

Since it is not itself an article of clothing it cannot receive impurity.  It may be worn on Shabbat since it is necessary to hold up a person’s hose. “Knee-bands” refers to chains attached to the garter to keep the legs from spreading to far apart.  According to the Talmud these were typically worn by women.  Since they have chains, they are considered to be in and of themselves an article of clothing and hence susceptible to impurity.

The locust’s egg was believed to aid in healing the ear, the fox’s tooth helped people who slept too much and the nail was believed to heal wounds.  According to Rabbi Meir a person can carry these items on Shabbat since they were used for healing.  Wearing them is therefore not considered “carrying.” The sages don’t really disagree that wearing these things is not considered “carrying.”  Rather, the sages say that it is always forbidden to use these things because they are “the ways of the Amorite.”  This refers to Leviticus 18:3 according to which Israelites should not imitate the nations that occupied Canaan.  The Rambam explains that anything which doctors state has medicinal value cannot be prohibited because of the “the ways of the Amorite.”  The only things that are prohibited are things which doctors say have not medicinal value but are believed by other nations to aid in healing.

For accidental performance of a forbidden labor, one must bring a sin-offering.  Our mishnah asks a frequently-asked rabbinic question: how do we know how many sin-offerings a person is liable for?  Asked another way, what constitutes one performance of a forbidden labor?",
                    "<b>A great principle they stated in respect to Shabbat: anyone who forgets the fundamental law of Shabbat and performs many labors on many Shabbatot, is liable for only one sin-offering.</b>  The mishnah begins by referring to a person who doesn’t remember that work is prohibited on Shabbat.  Such a person has in essence only transgressed once, no matter how many Shabbatot she performed the forbidden labor and no matter how many labors she performed.  For instance, a person who never learned about Shabbat and then later in life learned that it was forbidden to work on Shabbat, would only be liable for one sin-offering.",

All of the forbidden labors which she performs on any given Shabbat are considered one transgression.  Therefore she brings one sin-offering for every Shabbat which she forgot was Shabbat, no matter how many forbidden labors she performed.",

Such a person is liable for every primary labor.  As we shall see in tomorrow’s mishnah, there are thirty-nine categories of prohibited labor. Each category is a “primary labor.”  Within each category there are derived labors, prohibitions which are similar enough to the primary labor to also be prohibited.  Derived labors” are as prohibited as “primary labors” (they are all in the category of “deoraita” toraitic prohibitions.)  The only difference is that if one performs several different “primary labors” she is liable for a sin-offering for each primary labor.  However, if she performs a primary labor and several derived labors from the same category, she is only liable for one sin-offering.  Furthermore, in the case in this section since the person didn’t know that such a labor was prohibited on Shabbat, she is only liable for one sin-offering no matter how many Shabbatot she performed the labor.",

These are the first three lists.  The fourth section contains six more labors that are also prohibited but do not easily fit into the other lists. The Talmud states that these labors were all learned from the juxtaposition of the laws of building the Tabernacle with the prohibition of work on Shabbat (Exodus 31:35).  Since the Torah had to state not to break Shabbat to build the Temple, it must be that any work which was done in building the Temple is prohibited on Shabbat. Much of the rest of the tractate will explain these labors, so we will be brief here.",

One interesting thing to note is that many commentators hold that tearing is prohibited only if the tear is made in order to sew new stitches.  Only constructive, purposeful work is prohibited “deoraita” on Shabbat.  Tearing in a destructive manner with no other purpose is still prohibited but only “derabbanan” a rabbinic prohibition.  “Hackling” refers to separating strands of wool.",

We should make a couple of important notes.  Tearing down is only considered a primary labor if it is performed with the intent of rebuilding.  Extinguishing is also only prohibited deoraita if it makes charcoal (like extinguishing a candle.)  “Striking with a hammer” is sort of a code-name for the completion of any piece of work.  When finished with a metal project the silversmith would strike it with a hammer to complete it.  That is why it is called “striking with a hammer.”",

But whatever is not fit to store and people do not [generally] store things like it, and one carries it out on Shabbat, only he that stores it is liable.</b> A person is only obligated for carrying something from one domain to another if the object which she carries is one that is important enough that people store it and guard it.  The object has to be one put to use by people. For instance keys are something that people are generally careful about, whereas a pebble is not.  It also has to be of the size that people are generally careful with and will store.  A loaf of bread would have such a size but a few small crumbs would not.  If one carries something from one domain to another that has this size and is of a nature that people store it to protect it, then the person is obligated to bring a sin-offering. If it is not something about which people generally care, then only a person who does care about it is liable for it.  For instance if most people are not careful with a tiny piece of bread and a person who is not careful with such a piece of bread carries it from one domain to another, she is not liable.  However, if a person is careful with a small piece of bread and does take care of it, she would be liable for carrying it from one domain to another."

And they do not combine with each other, because they are not alike in their standards.</b>  The general rule is that a person is liable for carrying an amount of animal food equal to a mouthful of the animal that eats that type of food.  Cows eat straw, so if he carries a mouthful of straw he is liable. Moist leaves of garlic and onion are fit for human consumption.  Therefore one who carries an amount the size of a dried fig is liable.  Goats eat dried leaves of onion and garlic, therefore to be liable for carrying these he must carry a goat’s mouthful.  These are listed in this section probably because they are more normally eaten by goats. If a person carries a combination of these things each of which is less than the prohibited amount, they do not add up to create a prohibited amount.  For instance, if he carries half a cow’s mouthful of straw and half a camel’s mouthful of bean stubble he is not liable.

If a person carries two different types of food, they add up.  So if one carries half a fig’s worth of raisins and half a fig’s worth of peanuts, she is liable for carrying.  This is because there is one standard amount for all human food. When figuring out the size of a piece of food, the non-edible parts are not considered.

For carrying milk, she is liable if she carries the amount normally swallowed at one time.  Honey was evidently used to heal wounds.  Oil was used like lotion and therefore she is liable if she carries enough to oil up a small limb, for instance a finger.  Water was mixed with collyrium, an eye ointment.

Rabbi Shimon adds that the object also has to have a minimum measure.  Our mishnah provides, according to Rabbi Shimon, the minimum measure for liquids.  If a person is one who “stores” these liquids then the minimum measure to be liable for carrying is as listed above in section one.

He derives this halakhah from a comparison that Isaiah makes between idols and a menstruant.  In his exhortation against idolatry Isaiah states that the people of Israel will cast out their idols like a menstruous woman.  Leviticus 15:22 teaches that a menstruous woman defiles things not just by touching them but even by sitting on them.  From here the rabbis derive that she transmits impurity also by being carried.

One who throws from one balcony to the other, or one who reaches something over from one to the other is exempt (according to the sages, see yesterday’s mishnah).  As we shall see below, the reason is that this type of labor was not performed in the construction of the Tabernacle.<br>Sections two and three:  Here the two balconies are on the same side of the street, lying adjacent to one another. In this case the sages agree that one who reaches something over from one balcony to the other is liable, for this is how the Levites worked in the construction and deconstruction of the Tabernacle in the desert.  As we learn in the next section, the Levites had wagons which were placed one behind the other and they would pass boards from one to the other.  The wagons are considered to be private domains and that which lay in between them is the public domain.  Therefore, you have a case of people passing things from one public domain to another and a private domain lying in between.  However, the Levites did not throw the boards for that would not have been respectful of the inherent holiness of the parts of the Tabernacle.  Again, the principle is that anything that Levites did in the building of the Tabernacle is considered forbidden on Shabbat.   Since they didn’t throw, today people are not liable for throwing from one domain to another.  And since they only passed from wagons which were placed one behind the other, today people are not liable if they pass things across the public domain, as we learned in the previous section.<br>Section four:  If the border of a cistern is ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, it is considered to be a private domain and one who takes something from the public domain and puts it on this border or vice versa is liable.

However, the Talmud notes that when one is liable for rending one’s clothes as a sign of mourning for one’s dead, for instance over a close relative (parent, sibling, child or spouse), then there is constructive purpose to such tearing it fulfills the commandment to tear.  Therefore, when a person is obligated to tear and she tears on Shabbat, she is liable.  However, if one is exempt from tearing and nevertheless does so, she is exempt. There is also an interesting note on tearing in anger.  According to the Rambam, despite what the mishnah says, one is usually liable for tearing in anger because by such tearing one cools down.  Again, this makes the tearing constructive and therefore carries with it liability.  However, other commentators argue with the Rambam and say, based on a passage in the Talmud, that destroying things out of anger is akin to idol worship, because both are submissions to one’s evil inclination.  If a person’s evil inclination dictates that they destroy something, and they submit, they have begun down a slippery slope which will eventually lead to total demise which is symbolized in the Talmud by idol worship.

Killing an animal is a different, yet still prohibited labor.<br>Section one:  According to Rabbi Judah, once one traps a bird in a tower trap, which was a box in the shape of a tower, she has sufficiently trapped the animal such that she is liable for hunting.  Similarly, if she traps a deer in a house she is liable.  However, if she traps a bird in a house she is exempt because it will still require further trapping in order to get the bird. Furthermore, the bird can escape the house and therefore, the bird is not really trapped. Also, if the deer is trapped into a larger space, then she is not liable.<br>Section two: The sages agree with Rabbi Judah with regard to the bird but disagree with him with regard to the trapping of the deer.  Even if she traps the deer into a courtyard or corral she is still liable.<br>Section three:  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel notes that liability depends on the size of the corral into which the deer has been trapped.  We can’t just state unequivocally that trapping into all corrals makes one liable.  If catching the deer requires no further worth of hunting (meaning it can be caught easily) than it has already been hunted and she is liable.  However, if catching the deer will require further work, then the one who catches it in the corral is not liable.<br>It is interesting to note that Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says that not all corrals are the same.  It may be that in contrast, most houses and courtyards were the same, meaning they were similarly built and of similar size."

Albeck explains (based on the Palestinian Talmud) that making “hilmi” is the work of a professional and was therefore prohibited.  “Salt water” is made by non-professionals and hence is prohibited.

Therefore, if she wishes to make salt water, she should first put the oil either into the water or into the salt, and only afterwards put in the water.

Since this is the only reason that they would be rubbed on one’s body, it is forbidden to do so on Shabbat.  However, oil may be rubbed on a person’s body for a variety of other reasons and therefore it is permitted to rub oil for medicinal purposes as well.  When one does so it will not be recognized by others that she is healing herself.  Nevertheless, rose oil is forbidden since normal people don’t rub expensive rose oil on themselves except for medicinal purposes.  Again, this rule suffers one exception.  Children of royalty may anoint themselves with rose oil since they do so on the weekdays.  The rule is consistent:  a person may perform an act of healing on Shabbat if she regularly performs that same act for purposes other than healing. Finally, on a more poetic note, Rabbi Shimon states that all Jews are to be considered as the children of royalty, and therefore they all may anoint themselves with oil, regardless of their actual wealth. We might delay for a moment on the philosophy that lies behind Rabbi Shimon’s words.  Differences in wealth do not create essential distinctions between Jews and therefore the halakhah must (at least in this case) treat them equally. Their value stems from their having accepted the Torah and is irregardless of their actual monetary wealth."

The fact that the minor doesn’t really know that what she is doing is forbidden does not mean that she is allowed to do forbidden work on Shabbat, or that we may allow her to do such work. We should note that according to the Talmud Jews do not have to stop minors from doing forbidden things such as eating non-kosher food, or performing forbidden labors on Shabbat.

In the case mentioned here, if the fire were to catch the beams which hold up the roof, it could cause significant damage.  Hence, it is permitted to turn a dish over it to prevent it from spreading. The mishnah continues to list other instances in which one can overturn a dish on Shabbat.  The first is over the excrement of an infant, which itself cannot be moved because it is muktzeh (off-limits).  It is muktzeh because it is disgusting.  So even though it is muktzeh, one may carry a vessel to cover it. The second thing is covering a scorpion with a dish so that it will not bite.  Although this may be seen as trapping/hunting, since she does so not for her own need (i.e. to use the scorpion) but rather to prevent it from causing damage, it is permitted. However, R. Yohanan ben Zakkai thinks that one who turns a dish over a scorpion is dangerously close to being liable to bring a sin-offering on Shabbat, i.e. this may be prohibited.  The problem is that if she covers the scorpion to catch it and then use it for medicinal purposes, she would be liable (see Eduyot 2:5).  When this incident came before R. Yohanan ben Zakkai he didn’t outright rule that the person was liable, but neither did he say that it was fully permissible."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThere are certain objects which it is forbidden to carry or move on Shabbat and they are called in Hebrew, “muktzeh” which literally means “set aside.”  There are several reasons why the rabbis prohibited carrying certain types of vessels on Shabbat, but the most basic reason is to preserve the character of Shabbat as distinct from all other days.  In other words, even though certain activities may be technically permitted, they are opposed to the “spirit” of Shabbat, and hence the sages did all that they could to keep a person away from such activities or even from the appearance of performing such activities.  Another reason is that if one is allowed to touch a vessel which is used to perform prohibited work, one might come to perform the work itself.\nAs a general rule, if a vessel is used for activities which are permitted on Shabbat, then one can carry the vessel on Shabbat.  An example of such a vessel would be a cup or a plate.  If the vessel is used for things prohibited on Shabbat, then it is still permissible to carry the vessel as long as the intention is not to use it to perform a prohibited labor.  It can be carried to perform a permitted labor and it also may be carried because the person simply doesn’t want it to be where it currently is.\nThis chapter will teach the details of the laws of muktzeh.\nA note on translation:  the Hebrew word for vessel is “keli.”  This word can be used to refer to things that we commonly call utensils, and it can also refer to clothes.  It would include most anything made by people with the exception of things attached to the ground such as homes.  The article also must be used as an instrument to do something else a book or a document is not a “keli.”",
                    "<b>All utensils may be carried on Shabbat and their doors with them, even if they became detached on Shabbat, for they are not like the doors of a house, which are not set aside for use.</b> All vessels that have doors and which are used for permitted activities on Shabbat, may be carried with their doors.  An example would be a trunk which has a door on its top.  Furthermore, one may carry the doors on Shabbat even if the doors become detached from their vessels.  This is true even if the doors became detached before Shabbat.  The mishnah compares these doors with those of a house.  House doors may not be carried on Shabbat because they are not normally carried around; rather they are attached to the house which is attached to the ground.  Something may be carried only if it is an item that is normally carried.  This is true with regard to doors of a vessel which are in normal situations carried with as part of their vessels."

The container would be flipped over by using the “reed for olives.” When they flipped the container they would check the reed to see if it was moist.  If it was they would know that the olives were soft and that they could begin to press them.

In the Talmud there is a debate what it means when the mishnah says they are “not required.”  According to one explanation, “not required” means that the person doesn’t want to use the vessel itself, but rather wants to move it away from its current place.  For instance, I might want to move a knife not to use the knife to cut something but to keep it away from my child.  According to this explanation, there must be some purpose to moving the knife.  Another explanation is that “not required” means that the person is carrying it for no reason whatsoever.  Our explanation of this clause will impact our explanation of Rabbi Nehemiah’s debate.  According to the first explanation, Rabbi Nehemiah forbids carrying the object unless the object itself is needed. For instance, a knife may be carried only if one wants to use the knife itself.  According to the second explanation, Rabbi Nehemiah would allow carrying the knife even if one only wants to move it to clear it from its current place.  He would forbid moving the vessel only if there was truly no purpose to doing so."

Thus a piece of a kneading trough must still be large enough to hold a thick mixture, a usage similar to its original usage. The Talmud explains that Rabbi Judah is referring to a case where the vessel broke on Shabbat itself.  In such a case, since when Shabbat began the vessel was intended for a specific purpose (such as kneading) no part of it can be used for something else on Shabbat.  By breaking on Shabbat and being used for something else it would be like a new vessel, one that was in essence made on Shabbat.  However, if the vessel was broken before Shabbat its pieces can be carried for other purposes on Shabbat, because when Shabbat began they were already capable of fulfilling other purposes."

However, in a time when the Roman authorities forbade circumcision (the Hadrianic persecutions, leading up to and following the Bar Kochba revolt) the knife should be hidden so as to avoid danger.  The witnesses are needed to testify that the reason that he is carrying is only in order to perform a circumcision.  In other words, they are for his protection.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer said further: one may cut wood to make charcoal to make an iron instrument.</b>  Rabbi Eliezer goes to an even greater extreme.  Even if one does not have any knife with which to circumcise, one may cut down wood to heat up iron to make a knife.  It seems unlikely that one would actually find oneself in such a situation.  Rabbi Eliezer’s statement is meant to have polemical value anything may be done so that the circumcision may be carried out on Shabbat.",

This would include the circumcision itself, as we shall learn in tomorrow’s mishnah.  However, preparatory activities such as making the knife and carrying it to where the circumcision will be performed must be performed before Shabbat begins.  The reason that Rabbi Akiva’s statement is phrased as a general rule is that it applies to several other halakhot as well (see Pesahim 6:2 and Menahot 11:3)."

This includes the two main parts of the circumcision itself the cut and the tearing of the membrane which covers the corona. “Sucking the wound” was believed to have certain health benefits and hence was considered to be an essential part of the circumcision.  Indeed the Talmud states that any mohel who doesn’t suck the wound is to be removed from his job.  In our day, due to our knowledge of orally transmitted diseases, this part of the ritual has become very controversial.  Some groups do not do this at all, claiming that there is no health benefit and that even in the Talmud it was not considered to be as essential as the “cutting and tearing”.  Since the 19th century some mohels have been using various other contraptions to do the sucking, including a sponge and a glass tube.  Some ultraorthodox groups still suck by direct contact with the mouth. The compress and cumin mixture were placed on the wound to aid in the healing.  I do not know of any group that still uses cumin although compresses are still used by all.",
                    "<b>If one did not grind [the cumin] on the eve of Shabbat, he may chew [it] with his teeth and apply [it to the wound].</b>  On Shabbat itself, since grinding is a forbidden labor, it would be forbidden to grind the cumin in order to put it on the wound.  If he hasn’t prepared the cumin before Shabbat while he may not grind it, he may chew it up in his mouth and then put it on the wound. Again, they didn’t know about germs in the days of the Talmud.",
                    "<b>If he did not beat up wine and oil on the eve of Shabbat, he should apply each separately.</b>  They would also put a mixture of wine and oil on the wound.

This “cloak” should not be made on Shabbat.  So if he didn’t make it before Shabbat, what he may do is temporarily wrap a small rag around the penis.",

However, he may wrap the rag around his finger and carry it. This way it is as if he is wearing the rag (which is permitted) and not just carrying it.  The mishnah allows it to be carried even from another courtyard.  The commentators debate whether this implies that it also may be carried through the public domain."

First of all, he holds that the child may be bathed in a normal manner and not just by sprinkling on him.  Secondly, the child may be bathed even if Shabbat falls on the third day after his circumcision, and not just on the day of the circumcision itself.  This Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah learns from the story of Shechem’s circumcision where we see that he and the people from his city were still hurting on the third day.  Talmudic commentators debate whether this means that the infant may be bathed up until the third day, and also on the first and second day after the circumcision, or just the third day, but not the first two days.  It seems to me that the first position is more reasonable.  According to the latter position we would have to say that for some reason the pain is worse on the third day.",

Such a child can never be circumcised on Shabbat.  For instance, let’s say he was born on twilight between Friday and Shabbat.  His circumcision will end up being on Sunday.  It can’t be on Friday, lest he was born on Shabbat and Friday is only the seventh day. It can’t be on Shabbat lest he was born on Friday and Shabbat would be the ninth day.  Circumcision overrides the rules of Shabbat only if it is on the eighth day. Therefore the circumcision is pushed off until Sunday (we shall learn more about this below in mishnah five.)  I should note that others explain the mishnah differently. This explanation goes according to Albeck. A hermaphrodite has signs of being both male and female.  He is circumcised but his circumcision cannot take place on Shabbat.  This is because we are not sure of his halakhic status as male and hence it could be that he doesn’t really need to be circumcised.  His circumcision is “doubtful” and therefore it doesn’t override Shabbat. Rabbi Judah considers a hermaphrodite to be a male and therefore his circumcision overrides Shabbat."

As an aside, the reason that it can’t be used on Shabbat is lest one write a receipt or an account of the money spent.  To move the money one merely tilts the cushion and the money falls off.

Hence one may remove them.  Bet Hillel disagrees and holds that these are muktzeh.  Hence, if she wishes to remove them, she must remove the board from the table (a sort of personal tray placed in front of one or several diners) and shake it off.  In the Talmud they bring a source according to which these two opinions should be reversed, Bet Hillel holding the more lenient opinion and Bet Shammai the stricter one.<br>Section two:  Animal food is not muktzeh.  Since crumbs and husks of beans and lentils may be used for animal food, they are not muktzeh and it is permitted to remove them from the table on Shabbat.<br>Section three:  This section discusses the problem of sponges.  Squeezing water or liquids out of something is prohibited.  Its prohibition is derived from the prohibited labor of “laundering”, since squeezing water out of clothes is part of the laundering process.  One can’t use a sponge that does not have a handle because by doing so one might squeeze water from the sponge.<br>The sages say that whether or not it has a handle it may be carried on Shabbat because it is a vessel and all vessels may be carried on Shabbat.  However, it is not the type of vessel that can receive impurity.<br>Some manuscripts read differently in the concluding clause.  Some read, “and the sages say: in any case he may use it for wiping.”  According to this version, the sages disagree with the previous opinion, according to which wiping with a sponge without a handle is forbidden.  Other versions skip the words “and the sages say” and rather read the final point as a point of agreement between all.  All agree that even though you can’t use the sponge to wipe things, it still may be carried."

And he [the owner] may say to others, “come and save for yourselves”, provided that it is not sponged up.</b>  Above in 16:2 the mishnah taught that one can rescue from a fire food sufficient for three meals, the standard number of meals eaten on Shabbat.  In our explanation there we explained that the reason that a person was not allowed to rescue more than that was lest she come to extinguish the fire.  However, here it is less clear what the concern is. The commentators explain that if they let her rescue more than three meals she may carry them in the public domain.  Alternatively, she may come to fix the casket.  An alternative explanation which I would suggest is that more than three meals is muktzeh since it won’t be eaten on Shabbat. As above, she is allowed to say to other people, “come save the wine for yourselves.”  However, no one is allowed to rescue the wine by sponging it up.  The fear is that if they sponge it up they may squeeze the sponge out afterwards, and as we have already learned and will continue to learn below, squeezing liquids out of something is prohibited.",

Rabbi Judah says: if [the fruit is meant] to be food, that which exudes from it is permitted, but if [is meant to be] juice, that which exudes from it is prohibited.</b>  Squeezing juice out of fruit is considered to be a prohibited labor derived from the prohibited labor of “threshing”.  Just as “threshing” separates the desirable wheat from the undesirable chaff, so too squeezing separates the juice from the fruit.  The mishnah teaches that even if the juice exudes without being squeezed by a person.  The fear is that if this juice is allowed people will become confused and think it is permitted to actually squeeze the juice out. Rabbi Judah distinguishes between fruit that is intended to be eaten and fruit that is intended to be used for juice.  If the juice exudes from fruit which is intended to be eaten, then it is permitted because a person doesn’t want the juice to come out of this fruit.  A person won’t come to squeeze such a fruit.  However, if the fruit is intended for juice then Rabbi Judah too is strict and rules that even the juice that exudes is forbidden.",

If honey exudes from them on Shabbat, such honey may not be eaten. Again the fear is that if they permit such honey people will think that the honeycombs may be squeezed on Shabbat itself.  Rabbi Elazar is not concerned with such a possibility and hence he allows this honey to be eaten on Shabbat."

Therefore, if something was already cooked before Shabbat, it can be put back in hot water on Shabbat without this being considered “cooking.”  In other words, “there is no cooking something that has already been cooked.”",

However, it still may be rinsed in hot water because rinsing is generally not considered to be cooking. The mishnah lists a few exceptions to this rule.

The problem is that when she pours wax she will also need to smooth it out.  The rabbis thought that smoothing out wax was like “erasing” which is prohibited.  Rabbi Judah relates a case where a person who perforated a cask/stopper at its side came in front of R. Yohanan ben Zakai and R.

It is obvious that this is permitted since this isn’t in any way cooking.

The mishnah teaches that she may continue to wear the clothes and if by walking or sitting she causes the water to be squeezed out then it is a by-product of normal activity and it is not forbidden.  Others explain that the mishnah teaches that she need not be concerned lest others think she laundered her clothes on Shabbat. However, once she reaches the outer courtyard of the city, meaning the first courtyard she finds, she should take off her wet clothes (obviously not if this will leave her naked in public) and she may spread them out so that they may dry.  She shouldn’t spread them out so that others see what she is doing lest others think that she did her laundry on Shabbat."

The “Shabbat border” is the limit which a person is allowed to walk out of town on Shabbat.  This border is two thousand cubits outside of the city.\nThe commonality between these two subjects (hiring workers and going out to the border) is that both are connected to Isaiah 58:13, “If you honor [the Sabbath] and do not do your business, nor look to your affairs, nor make statements [then you can seek the favor of the Lord]”.  This translation tries to capture the spirit of how the rabbis understand the verse.  Isaiah speaks of activities that are not necessarily forbidden by the Torah but nevertheless are activities which turn Shabbat into an ordinary day.

However, one should not do so in order to get a jump start on performing an activity prohibited on Shabbat.

However, the body itself may not be moved because it is muktzeh. The reason it is muktzeh is that there is no use for the body on Shabbat, and all things which have no use may not be moved.",
                    "<b>One may remove the pillow from under him, and [thereby] place him on sand, in order that he should be better preserved.</b>  One may remove the pillow/mattress upon which the dead body lies in order that it should be on the ground. This was considered a better means for preserving the body and preventing deterioration and the accompanying smell.",
                    "<b>One may tie up the jaw, not in order that it should close but that it should not further [open].</b>  One may tie the dead body’s jaw so that the mouth does not gape open further than it already is at the point of death.  However, it is forbidden to close the jaw because it is forbidden to move even a limb of the body.  One may preserve the state that the body is currently in, but not change that state.",
                    "<b>And likewise, if a beam is broken, one may support it with a bench or bed posts, not in order that it [the break] should close up, but that it should go [open] no further.</b>  This section is loosely connected to that in the previous section.   If a beam supporting the ceiling breaks on Shabbat, one may put something beneath it to support it so that it does not break any more.  However, one may not put something underneath it so that the break closes up.",
                    "<b>One may not close [the eyes of] a corpse on Shabbat, nor on weekdays when he is about to die, and he who closes the eyes [of a dying person] at the point of death is a murderer.</b>  If a person dies with his/her eyes open, one may not close the eyes because it is forbidden to move a limb of the body.  The mishnah adds that even during the week it is prohibited to close the eyes of a dying person because this may cause death to arrive more speedily. This is indeed a primary source used by halakhic authorities who wish to prohibit euthanasia.  One may not do anything to make death come faster.  However, we should remember that it is nearly impossible to learn what halakhah has to say on any given topic from one single source, especially one as sensitive and controversial as euthanasia."

                    "<b>One for whom it becomes dark while on the road, he may give his purse to a non-Jew; And if there is no non-Jew with him, he places it on a donkey.</b>  Once it becomes dark the Jew must not carry her purse, since it is prohibited to carry in the public domain.  However, she may give the purse to a non-Jew.  The rabbis permitted this because if they had been strict a person may be so attached to her possessions that she would herself carry on Shabbat.  Since it is less problematic to give the purse to the non-Jew than for the Jew herself to carry, giving it away is preferable.  However, we should remember that generally it is forbidden to ask a non-Jew to do work on Shabbat on behalf of a Jew. If there is no non-Jew with her, then she may place the purse on a donkey and allow the donkey to carry it back to the city.  However it is preferable to give the purse to the non-Jew because Jews are supposed to let their animals rest on Shabbat as well, but a Jew is not commanded to ensure that the non-Jew rest on Shabbat.",
                    "<b>When he reaches the outermost courtyard, he removes the objects which may be handled on Shabbat. As for those which may not be handled on Shabbat, he unties the cords and the sacks fall off automatically.</b>  When the traveler who has put her purse (or other goods) on a donkey reaches the outermost courtyard of the city, she may no longer allow them to remain on the donkey, since they have now reached a safe point.  Therefore, those objects that she may handle on Shabbat, she must remove and stow them somewhere safe.   Those objects that may not be handled, she must undo the straps which attach them to the donkey and they will fall to the ground on their own. We should note that the “city” to which the mishnah refers is one in which everybody knows each other, and therefore people can leave their private belongings in a public area without much fear of their being stolen.  This reminds me of the situation in a kibbutz, or perhaps a summer camp, but it is certainly different from the situation in our cities."

The general principle which we learn in this mishnah is that a person is allowed to do something which turns food which cannot be eaten by the animal into food which can be eaten.  Bundles of hay must be untied before they can be eaten, and large sheaves must be spread out before they may be eaten by the animal.  However, the small hardened twigs cannot be eaten by the animal even after they are spread out.  Hence, one may not untie or spread out a bundle of this type of twigs.",

Rabbi Judah permits it in the case of carobs for small beasts.</b>  Chopping up unripe grain and carobs is a lot of work and animals will eat unripe grain and carobs.  Since this work is not necessary and it is not easily performed it is forbidden on Shabbat.  Rabbi Judah holds that it is permitted to chop up carobs for small animals (sheep and goats) since they cannot eat the carobs until they are chopped up.  It is only forbidden for large animals which can eat unripe grain and carobs without them being chopped up."

In this way it wouldn’t be necessary to feed the camel while on the road.  [Note: this unfortunately does not work for humans.]  Since this is a lot of work, and is also preparing on Shabbat for after Shabbat, it is not permitted.  However, if the camel does not want to eat at all, it is permitted to put food into its mouth.",

                    "<b>And one may put food into one’s hands for chickens and one may put water into bran, but not mix it [into a mass].</b>  Mixing water into a mass of bran is considered too much work to do on Shabbat, and it is not strictly necessary.  The chicken will be fine without the bran/water combination having been mixed.  Therefore, mixing is prohibited.  However, merely feeding the chickens by hand or putting water into a bowl of bran for them to eat is permitted.",
                    "<b>And one may not put water in front of bees or in front of doves in a dove-cote, but one may put [water] in front of geese, chickens and Rhodesian doves.</b>  Bees and doves fly long distances and should be able to find their own water.  Therefore, since is no need to put water out for them on Shabbat it is prohibited to do so.  However, geese, chickens and certain types of doves do not fly far from their owner’s homes and hence one may put water out for them on Shabbat.  The general principle which we again see illustrated is that something that is necessary to feed animals on Shabbat is permitted, while unnecessary actions are prohibited."

Rabbi Judah says: if it was not carcass by the eve of Shabbat it is forbidden, because it was not prepared.</b> Gourds are normally eaten by human beings and are too expensive to be given to animals. Nevertheless, the mishnah rules that if one has gourds one may cut them up and give them to one’s beasts. The mishnah refers to a carcass of an animal that was alive when Shabbat began and became a carcass on Shabbat itself.   In such a case it was certainly not “prepared” before Shabbat to be given as dog food on Shabbat.  According to the first opinion, it is nevertheless permitted to give the carcass to the dogs.  Rabbi Judah disagrees and holds that the carcass is “muktzeh” and may therefore not be handled at all on Shabbat."

                    "<b>They may annul vows on Shabbat, and they may be asked [to release vows] when these are necessary for Shabbat.</b>  It is permitted for a husband to annul his wife’s vows and for a father to annul his daughter’s vow on Shabbat, since these vows may only be annulled on the day upon which they are heard (Numbers 30: 6, 9).  If they had to wait until after Shabbat was over to annul them, the vows could no longer be annulled. Similarly, sages may be asked to release a vow on Shabbat, but only if there is some reason to release the vow on Shabbat itself and not wait until Shabbat is over.  Such would be the case if for instance the vow was not to eat on Shabbat.  If the vow was not going to impact Shabbat, then they must wait until Shabbat is over. For more on how Sages release vows and how husbands and fathers annul vows see Nedarim 9-11.",
                    "<b>One may close up a skylight, and measure a rag and a ritual bath.</b>  The issue of closing up a skylight/window was discussed above in 17:7.  There we saw that the sages allowed one to put a board back into a window frame to close out the light. One is allowed to measure a rag on Shabbat to see if it is three handbreadths by three handbreadths, the minimum measurement required for it to be susceptible to impurity.  It is also permissible to measure a ritual bath to see if it contains the required 40 seah of water.  These two measurements are allowed because they are connected to mitzvot.  Other measurements would be forbidden.",
                    "<b>And it once happened in the days of Rabbi Zadok’s father and the days of Abba Shaul ben Botnit that they closed up the window with a small clay vessel and tied a [clay] pot to a string to ascertain whether there was the opening of a handbreadth or not in the barrel. And from their words we learn that we may close [a skylight] and measure and tie on Shabbat.</b>  The Talmud explains what exactly happened in this story.  There were two houses which shared a wall and there was a window in the wall.  In the window was a cracked barrel with a large hole in it.  On a certain Shabbat a person died in one of the houses and they wanted to know if there was a handbreadth’s gap in the pitcher, such that the impurity from one house would be transmitted to the other house.  First they closed up the skylight with a small clay vessel so that the priests could go up to the roof without becoming impure.  They then wanted to measure the crack in the barrel but couldn’t reach it from the roof. So they tied an earthenware pot the size of one handbreadth by one handbreadth to a string and lowered it to the hole of the barrel.  From these actions (which were certainly creative) we learn that it is permitted to close up a gap, to measure things to know whether they are impure and to make certain types of knots on Shabbat. Congratulations!  We have finished Shabbat. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Shabbat was the longest tractate we have covered so far, so an extra “yasher koah” to all who stuck it through.  Admittedly, many of the details were quite difficult and the halakhot truly dictated exactly what is and is not permitted on Shabbat.  I hope that learning this tractate will enrich your own Shabbat experience, and that you will find in the details of halakhah a system which forces a person to examine each and everyone one of her actions and to withdraw somewhat from the hustle bustle of the world for one day a week.  Shabbat is a day dedicated to holy activities, worship of God, study, reflection, eating and drinking and non-creativity.  The halakhot of Shabbat are meant to ensure that these lofty ideals can be achieved. May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more Mishnah!  Tomorrow we begin Eruvin, a tractate which is actually quite connected to Shabbat."
