            "Tractate “Yoma”, which is Aramaic for “The Day” (the tractate was also called “Kippurim” or “Yom HaKippurim”), teaches the laws of Yom Kippur.  However, seven of the eight chapters of the tractate deal with high priest’s worship in the Temple and only one of the chapters, the last one, deals with the laws of fasting and the issue of atonement.  In other words, after the destruction of the Temple only one of these chapters is of immediate halakhic relevance.  This is somewhat similar to the previous two tractates we have learned, Pesahim and Shekalim, which also contained large portions pertinent only to a time when the Temple still stood.  ",
            "The description of the high priest’s worship is found in Leviticus 16:1-34 and we shall make frequent reference to these verses.  The Mishnah in large part explicates these verses, although not in a midrashic fashion, following the order of the verses, but rather in “mishnaic” fashion, following the order in which these actions are done.  ",
            "Interestingly, there are very few debates between different sages in these mishnayot.  There are a few but they are mostly concerning the details and some of these concern the sacrificial procedures followed during the remainder of the year and not just on Yom Kippur.  Albeck therefore concludes that the core of this tractate is early, and existed when the Temple still stood. It was transmitted by sages in later generation and these sages added in a few of their own comments, but left most of it in the way they received it.  ",
            "For those of you who pay close attention to the Yom Kippur service, you may remember a section called “Avodah” which is recited towards the end of Mussaf.  The description of the high priest’s service described there is based on our Mishnah and on the accompanying Talmud, so when you get to shul (in little more than a month!)—pay attention and note the similarities.

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nTractate Yoma begins with preparations made seven days before Yom Kippur falls.  This whole chapter deals with the week before Yom Kippur and how the sages instruct the High Priest so that he will be able to correctly perform the Yom Kippur service.",
                    "<b>Seven days before Yom HaKippurim they remove the high priest from his house to the chamber of the counselors and they set up another priest to take his place lest something should occur to him to disqualify him [from being able to worship].</b>  Seven days before Yom Kippur they isolate the High Priest so that he doesn’t become impure.  Part of the purpose of this separation was to keep him away from his wife, lest his wife become a menstruant and he have intercourse with her and thereby be defiled.  If he contracted a serious form of impurity he would not be able to perform the service in the Temple.  The idea of a seven day period of separation is also learned from the Torah which also speaks of a seven day separation period, albeit not before Yom Kippur. In Leviticus 8:33 Moses instructs Aaron and the other priests not to leave the Tent of Meeting for the seven days before the Tabernacle is initially consecrated.  This separation period is seen by the Talmud as a precedent for the separation of the high priest before Yom Kippur.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah said: they even prepare another wife for him in case his wife should die, as it says “And he shall make atonement for himself and for his house” (Leviticus 16:6):  “his house” this refers to his wife. They said to him: if so there would be no end to the matter.</b>  The Torah states that the High Priest makes atonement “for his house”, and the word “house” is understood by the rabbis to refer to his wife.  This means that in order to be a high priest who can perform the Yom Kippur service, he needs to be married.  Hence, Rabbi Judah says that they set up for him an alternative wife, lest his first wife dies right before Yom Kippur thereby preventing him from fulfilling the biblical verse.  The rabbis respond that if we start worrying about such far-fetched possibilities, there will be no end to the matter.  We will need to worry lest both the first wife and the second wife should die.  Since the random death of his wife is unlikely, we don’t need to find him a second wife.  However, the possibility that he should become defiled is not so unlikely, and hence he does need to be separated from his home a week before Yom Kippur. I should note that there are some interesting implications from this Mishnah on the rabbinic views of marriage.  It is interesting that the rabbis demand that the “holiest” person in Judaism, the person responsible for the holiest service, must be married when he performs that service. This may be a statement somewhat directed against those Jewish groups who advocated celibacy, at least for their religious leaders.  However, we should also note that during the week before his service, he is separated from his wife. In other words, there is some ambiguity here.  He needs to be married, for the rabbis generally looked favorably upon procreation and upon sexual pleasure.  However, they may have seen marital life as partially distracting and hence dictated a separation during this brief but intense period."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah teaches that during the seven days before Yom Kippur the high priest performs regularly duties which he may or may not perform during the rest of the year.",
                    "<b>All seven days he sprinkles the blood and burns the incense and cleans lamps and offers the head and the leg;</b>  “Sprinkling the blood” refers to the blood of the daily tamid offerings which are offered in the morning and the evening.  The incense is mentioned in Exodus 30:1-8.  It is offered daily on the golden altar.  “Cleaning the lamps” means cleaning them from the accumulated ashes, waste-oil and putting in them new oil and wicks.  This task also includes lighting the new flame.  Finally, the “head and the leg” are the partsof the two daily tamid offerings which were put first onto the altar. The point of this mishnah is that parts of the service and other Temple duties that he could take part in during the rest of they year, but did not have to if he did not want to, become obligatory for him during the week before Yom Kippur. This is so that he becomes more accustomed to working in the Temple.  In other words, this is a warm up.",
                    "<b>And on all other days if he wants he offers, for the high priest is first in offering a portion and has first place in taking a portion.</b>  During the rest of the year, he need perform these tasks only if he wishes to do so.  The mishnah points out that any part of the sacrificial service that the high priest wishes to perform he may do so.  His right trumps that of any ordinary priest, even those whose shifts are currently serving in the Temple.  He also is the first to choose whichever part of the sacrifice he wishes, even if he wasn’t the one to offer it.  As they say, “it’s good to be the high priest!”"

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah describes how the elders educated the high priest during the week that preceded Yom Kippur.  We can easily note that the rabbis anticipate that the high priest will be completely uneducated in Torah and in the proper ways of the Temple service.  Indeed, they don’t think that he even knows how to identify common sacrificial animals!  According to the traditional understanding of this mishnah, the high priests that served in the Second Temple period were appointed by the kings out of political considerations and not for their expertise in Temple practice or for their personal piety.  This is largely corroborated out by other descriptions of the high priests in such writings as Josephus and other historical works.  However, the rabbis’ description of the high priest’s utter ignorance may be exacerbated by the Second Temple rivalry between the Pharisees, the rabbis’ spiritual forefathers and the Sadducees, a sect to which many high priests belonged.\nAnother interesting way of understanding this mishnah is to note the tension between the genealogically transmitted priesthood and the Torah which is transmitted from teacher to pupil and not necessarily from father to son. The rabbis generally favored the relationship of teacher to pupil even over that of father to son but also realized that the priesthood was genealogical.  In the high priest who must serve in the Temple’s most critical service even though he was an ignoramus these two values distinctly clash.",

And they say to him, “Sir, high priest, you read it yourself with your own mouth, lest you have forgotten or lest you have never learned.”</b>  During the week that precedes Yom Kippur the elders read to the high priest from Leviticus 16 so that he will understand how to perform the service.  Even if he professes to know what to do, they tell him to read it himself, or perhaps to repeat what they say to him, lest he might have forgotten it or lest he never read the portion in the first place.",

On the eve of Yom HaKippurim near nightfall they would not let him eat much because food brings about sleep.</b><br>This mishnah teaches that they didn’t let the High Priest drink or eat a lot on the eve of Yom Hakippurim because they thought that eating a big meal would make him sleepy and they didn’t want him to sleep that night.  The reason that he wasn’t allowed to sleep was lest he have a nocturnal emission which would make him impure and thereby prevent him from serving in the Temple the next day. Since seminal emissions cause one to be impure for only one day, they only needed to prevent him from eating on the eve of Yom Kippur. During the rest of the week he was allowed to eat and drink in a normal fashion."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nAs I stated in my commentary to mishnah two and in my introduction to the tractate, many of the high priests were Sadducees, or perhaps more accurately, had Sadducean leanings.  The Sadducees debated with the Pharisees the proper form of the Yom Kippur ritual, as I explain below. In the mishnah’s eyes, the elders spend a week teaching the high priest how to perform the service in the proper Pharisaic manner.  Our mishnah describes the parting words between the elders and the high priest, where they remind him to act like a Pharisee and not a Sadducee.",
                    "<b>The elders of the court handed him over to the elders of the priesthood and they took him up to the upper chamber of the house of Avtinas.</b>  On the eve of Yom Kippur the elders would give him over to the elders of the priesthood.  He would go up to the house of Avtinas where the incense was normally made.  There he would learn how to make the incense that he was going to make on Yom Kippur within the Holy of Holies.",

And they said to him [when leaving]: “Sir, high priest, we are messengers of the court and you are our messenger and the messenger of the court. We adjure you by the one that caused His name dwell in this house that you do not change anything of what we said to you.”</b>  When the elders of the court depart from him they recite to him the following oath, reminding him that he must do whatever they have taught him to do.  The Talmud explains that there was the following debate between the Sadducees and the Pharisees.  The Sadducees held that the high priest would put the incense into the incense pan outside of the Holy of Holies and then go inside, whereas the Pharisees held that this was done inside.",
                    "<b>He turned aside and wept and they turned aside and wept.</b>  In the climactic conclusion to the mishnah, both the high priest and the elders end up crying (this would make a good movie).  He cries because they suspected him of being a Sadducee and they cry because reality forced them to suspect him.  Alternatively, they cry because the situation in their time had deteriorated so badly that they had to force a high priest to take an oath that he would not act like a Sadducee."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe mishnah has now reached the night before Yom Kippur is to begin. As we learned in mishnah four, he had to stay up all night.  Our mishnah teaches that in order to keep himself awake he would study Torah all night (this never seems to work for me, but I’m not a high priest, not even a priest).",
                    "<b>If he was a sage he would expound, and if not, the disciples of the sages would expound before him.</b>  If the high priest was a sage, then he would expound upon the Torah all night.  But if he didn’t know how to interpret the Torah, then disciples of the sages would do this in front of him, thereby helping to keep him awake.",

But again, if he couldn’t even read, then the disciples of the sages would read in front of him.  Note again how the mishnah takes into consideration the possibility that the high priest would not even know how to read from the Bible.  The Talmud again reminds us that in the Second Temple period high priests were often positions appointed by the king based on political considerations and were not given to the most knowledgeable of the priests.",

Job and Daniel are compelling stories.  Daniel and Ezra are partly in Aramaic, which may have made them easier to comprehend for a high priest who didn’t even understand Hebrew.  I am not sure what the attraction of Chronicles is.  Note that all four books are from “K’tuvim”, the last portion of the Hebrew Bible."

The removal of the ashes is referred to in Leviticus 6:3 and in tractate Tamid, which is in Seder Kodashim (hopefully we will learn this, but not for a few more years). I should note that in the Talmud there is a debate over the meaning of the phrase that I have translated as “the cock’s crow”.  Some interpret this to mean an announcement made by a man, who said, “Priests get up for your word.”  In Hebrew the word for “cock” and the word for “man” is the same.  I will not comment on this.",

The Talmud explains that this was because the high priest himself would clean out the ashes and they wanted to give him some time between this work and the rest of the day’s work.  Others explain that they did the cleaning of the ashes early so that they wouldn’t have to delay beginning the real work of the day which would come later. On festivals they cleaned out the ashes even earlier, at the end of the first watch, which means one-third into the night.  On festivals there are a lot of sacrifices and therefore there a lot of ashes, so that had to start cleaning out early.",

Here we learn that originally any priest that wished to could remove the ashes from the altar and they didn’t draw lots to decide who would have this privilege.  The other labors in the Temple were decided by drawing lots.  However, because one had to get up so early in the morning to remove the ashes, they feared that if they decided who was to do so by lot, few would want to do so.  Therefore, they opened it up to free competition.",

Every priest would stick out one or two fingers and an officer of the priests would call out a number much larger than the number of priests present.  He then would begin counting fingers and the person whose finger was counted last would win.  However, thumbs didn’t count because of cheaters who would claim that their thumb was either out or not out so that the count would end with them.  To avoid this problem they disallowed sticking out the thumbs and having them counted. As an aside, the mention of the thumb somewhat introduces the concept of cheating in order to perform a religious duty. This is a small form of cheating, one which doesn’t harm others.  Nevertheless, it shows how religious zeal to perform a ritual might lead a person to unethical behavior. The unethical behavior which we will see in yesterday’s mishnah is far worse."

                    "<b>Section one:  It once happened that two were even as they ran up the ramp, and one of them pushed his fellow who fell and broke his leg. When the court saw that they incurred danger, they decreed that they would remove the ashes from only by a count. Section two:  There were four counts. This is the first count.</b>  The event of one priest pushing another priest in order to be the one who would perform an act seemingly as ordinary and trivial as removing the ashes from the altar was such a traumatic experience that the court decreed an end to the races up the ramp.  Henceforth, the decision who would remove the ashes would be decided by a count, as was described in yesterday’s mishnah. There is an interesting parallel to this mishnah, one which is far more extreme.  The following source can be found on Yoma 23a: Our Rabbis taught: It once happened that two priests were even as they ran up the ramp and when one of them came first within four cubits of the altar, the other took a knife and thrust it into his heart. Rabbi Zadok stood on the steps of the Hall and said: Brothers of the House of Israel, listen! Behold it says: “If a body is found slain in the land... then your elders and judges shall come forth …” (Deuteronomy 21:1): On whose behalf shall we bring the calf whose neck is to be broken, on behalf of the city or on behalf of the Temple Courts? All the people burst out weeping. The father of the young man came and found him still in convulsions. He said: “May he be an atonement for you. My son is still having convulsions and the knife has not become unclean.”  This comes to teach you that the cleanness of their vessels was of greater concern to them even than the shedding of blood. In this fascinating and horrific story, instead of causing his rival priest merely to fall down and break his leg, one priest takes out a knife and stabs his fellow priest.  Rabbi Zadok ironically asks who brings the calf, whose neck is broken in a case where an unidentified dead body is found (see the quote from Deuteronomy), the city or the Temple courts.  Finally, in the ultimate point of religious zeal, the father of the son poignantly remarks to the other priests that at least he has removed the knife before it is defiled by his son’s dead body.  The source demonstrates well that the priests of that time had gone so astray that the issue of the purity of their vessels was more important to them then the most heinous sin of shedding blood. This mishnah and the accompanying Talmudic story are strong lessons to us of the dangers of religious zeal which can lead to violence.  As important as ritual procedure is, and don’t forget we are in the middle of a tractate which is nearly entirely dedicated to the performance of ritual, we are not to forget that morality and the proper relationship between human beings are supreme values as well. It is not that we must choose between commandments between God and human beings and those between humans and themselves. The two are only in conflict if we let them be, and that we must not.",

Many of these changes were done to make the work on Yom Kippur easier for the high priest.  The others were done to highlight the importance of the day.<br>Section one:  On other days he would take the cinders off the altar with a silver coal-pan and then transfer them into a gold coal-pan. This was done in order to preserve the gold coal-pan because putting it directly into the fire would damage it.  The Talmud demonstrates from here that the Torah has mercy on Israel’s money and doesn’t require them to consistently make the most expensive expenditures possible (a lesson that I think we would do well to take to heart).  However, on Yom Kippur in order to make things less complicated for the high priest, the coals were removed with gold-pan itself and brought into the Hekhal and later into the Holy of Holies in the same gold-pan.<br>Section two:  On other days he would remove the coals with a coal-pan that held four kav (about 8 liters) of coals and then transfer the coals to a slightly smaller pan which held on three kav.  The extra kav of coals would spill out and they would sweep them away into the water channel in the Temple courtyard.  On Yom Kippur since only one pan was being used he only removed three kav.  Rabbi Yose says that on other days he would remove one seah, which is an equivalent of six kav of coals.  He agrees that on Yom Kippur he would remove only three kav.<br>Sections three and four:  Both of these changes from the daily routine would make the removal of the coals easier for the high priest.<br>Section five:  Red gold was considered more valuable than greenish gold. Therefore it was used on Yom Kippur but not during the rest of the year.<br>Section six:  Every other day the high priest would make two incense offerings, each of incense weighing half a mina, the weight of fifty dinars in coins.  These two incense offerings were done on the incense altar in the Hekhal.  On Yom Kippur because there was a third offering inside the Holy of Holies, he would have to add two handfuls.<br>Section seven:  The daily incense was finely ground but the special incense for Yom Kippur, that which will be brought into the Holy of Holies was ground even finer.  This is because Leviticus 16:12, the chapter concerning Yom Kippur, emphasizes that the incense must be ground fine, which is understood to mean that it must be ground even finer than the regular incense mentioned in Exodus 30:36 which also must be ground fine."

Other versions of the mishnah read “they would go up the middle and come down the middle”, in which case it refers to the high priest and those other priests who accompany him. Rabbi Judah says that when the high priest goes up and comes down the ramp, he always does so in the middle.  Rabbi Judah here and in the next section seems to be emphasizing that the honor of the high priest is no less during the rest of the year than it is on Yom Kippur.

The second was the pile from which cinders were taken to burn the daily incense offering.  The third was to keep an eternal flame (see Leviticus 6:5).  The fourth was to burn the limbs of sacrifices that they had not succeeded in burning during the night. On Yom Kippur they added one more wood-pile from which the high priest would collect the cinders to burn the special incense which he will bring into the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Yose holds that there was no special wood-pile for the limbs that had not been burned during the night. Rabbi Judah holds that there wasn’t a special wood-pile to preserve an eternal flame.

This is true even if he already sprinkled six out of the seven times.  In other words, all of the sprinklings must be done with the blood of the same animal. However, if he finished sprinkling inside and was sprinkling in the Hekhal when the blood spilled, he need not go back and redo the inside sprinklings.

In such a case they cannot just buy another goat, because that goat would automatically take the place of the old goat without it ever going through the lottery process.

This goat has no function because its place is taken by the living goat from the first pair.  This goat has the status of a sin-offering (see Leviticus 16:5) that cannot be sacrificed.  Usually a sin-offering that cannot be sacrificed is left to die. This situation arises when a person sets aside an animal to be a sin-offering, it is lost, he offers a new one in its place and then the old one is found.  Such an animal is left to die.  Our mishnah teaches that this is only true with regard to the sin-offering of an individual. The goat in our mishnah is communal and therefore it can go out to pasture until it becomes blemished, at which point it can no longer be sacrificed.  Then it is sold and the proceeds go to the Temple.

Similarly, if the goat to be sent out to the wilderness dies, the blood of the other goat, the one “For Hashem” must be spilled out.  If the “For Hashem” goat has not yet been slaughtered, it must be left to die.  In other words, Rabbi Judah disagrees with the halakhah in section four which says that if one goat dies then the other may still be used.  He holds that if one dies, the other dies as well.

These are the two mentioned in v. 24 as well.  Rabbi Akiva holds that the seven lambs were sacrificed with the morning tamid and not later in the day, as Rabbi Eliezer claims.",

This goat is called “done outside” in order to distinguish it from the other sin-offering goat whose blood is spilled inside the Holy of Holies.  These sacrifices are offered before the dusk tamid, which is always the final sacrifice of the day."

It discusses how we understand the biblical command to “afflict oneself” (see Leviticus 16:29-31; 23:26-32) as well as the rules and concepts regarding atonement.\nOur mishnah begins this discussion by teaching the five/six prohibitions that all fit under the category of “afflictions.”",
                    "<b>[On] Yom HaKippurim it is forbidden to eat, to drink, to wash, to anoint oneself, to put on sandals, or to have intercourse.</b>  According to the Babylonian Talmud there are five prohibitions (eating and drinking is considered only one prohibition), which are derived from the fact that the root for “afflict oneself” appears five times in the Torah in connection with Yom Kippur.  However, the Yerushalmi understands these as six prohibitions and does not connect them directly with the verses.  These are just how the rabbis understood the meaning of “afflict oneself.”  “Putting on sandals” refers to wearing leather shoes, whether they are sandals or closed shoes.",
                    "<b>A king or bride may wash their face, and a woman after childbirth may put on sandals, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the sages forbid it.</b>  In this section we learn that there are some exceptions to the general prohibitions.  A king or a bride may wash their face.  The king must look good in order to garner the respect of his people so we want him to look clean.  The rabbis want the bride to look beautiful for her husband, in order to help solidify the marriage.  They considered the first few days of marriage to be critical and to a certain extent were willing to relax some other prohibitions.  In our case, they allowed her to wash her face.  The woman after childbirth will be bothered by walking on the cold floor and therefore she is allowed to wear sandals.  Although the sages dispute these exceptions, the halakhah is like Rabbi Eliezer. We should note that the mishnah does not allow any exceptions for eating/drinking.  Some commentators derive from here that the prohibitions of eating/drinking are weightier than the others and hence cannot be waived under any circumstance (with the exception of issues of health)."

The rabbis hold that this amount of food is the size of a date with its seed, or in the case of liquids, a mouthful.  We should note that normally one is liable for eating an olive’s amount of food (a smaller amount) or a revi’it of liquid (more than a mouthful).

Note that the mishnah does not say that they are not obligated, but uses stronger language, saying that it is prohibited to make them fast.  In the Tosefta we see that Shammai (the eponymous founder of Bet Shammai) actually wanted his son to fast and the other sages forced him to feed his son.  I do not think that Shammai was crueler than the other sages, nor was he endangering his young son’s life.  One day without food will be discomforting but is unlikely to cause any physical damage. Rather I think that Shammai had a different concept of the observance of the commandments.  For Shammai the Torah commands us to “afflict ourselves” on Yom Kippur and the goal is therefore physical affliction.  Such an affliction can be achieved on a small child, even an infant.  In contrast, the sages understood the affliction as being more inwardly oriented, and hence applicable only to those who know what is going on.  A child can feel hunger, they all do, but a small child won’t know that his hunger is a form of religious observance.  He’ll just scream or if he’s a little older, perhaps whine.  In order to demonstrate that the point of the day is to affect our inner lives and not our physical hunger, the other sages forced Shammai to feed his son.",

Evidently, there was a belief in the time of the Mishnah that if one was bitten by a rabid dog, eating its liver-lobe would serve as a cure.  Most rabbis didn’t believe that this “cure” really worked and hence they should not give him the liver-lobe to eat.  Saving a life overrides the commandments, but only if that which is done really has a chance of working.  However, Rabbi Matia permits even this.   There are two different explanations for his opinion.  The first is that Rabbi Matia holds that eating the liver of the rabid dog is really an effective cure. [1 Julius Preuss, Biblical and Talmudic Medicine, p. 196, writes, “To treat the bite of a mad dog, the heathen physicians of antiquity, in general, as well as many primitive peoples today, gave the patient certain pieces of the liver of the mad dog to eat.”  Preuss refers to a number of Greco-Roman authors.  If you wish to try this at home, know that most of them recommend the liver be roasted.  Chopped liver is not recommended.  ]  The other, in my opinion more convincing explanation is that since the bit person thinks this cure is effective, the fact that it offers him psychological relief is enough for Rabbi Matia to permit it.",

As we learned frequently when we studied Shabbat, medicine is prohibited on Shabbat. Here we learn that this is true only if it is not a potential threat to a person’s life.  If there is danger to one’s life, then it is permitted, and indeed mandated to heal the person on Shabbat."

Our mishnah teaches that even if we don’t know that these three things are true, we do remove the debris in an attempt to save his life.  This is because, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah, even the potential to save a life overrides Shabbat. As you may have noted, according to the mishnah, if we knew that the person was not Jewish, we would not save his life on Shabbat.  I will not deny that the mishnah discriminates against non-Jews, but I think that this has to be understood as a reflection of the times.  Jews and Gentiles often did not get along, and Jews experienced a lot of persecution.  Furthermore, the idea of treating all of humanity as equal was not a common idea.  All peoples of the ancient world discriminated against others.  We should not expect ancient rabbis to express the same exact liberal values that we (hopefully) espouse today.",

We should note that the Mishnah makes a seamless transition from how atonement was effected when the Temple still stood through sacrifices, to how it is effected after the destruction through atonement and Yom HaKippurim.  In Temple times, Yom HaKippurim itself did not effect atonement; rather Yom HaKippurim was the day upon which atoning sacrifices were offered.  By including repentance with the sacrifices, the Mishnah makes the strong ideological statement that repentance (teshuvah) is as effective as sacrifice, and would work even when sacrifices were no longer possible.  This was certainly a monumental statement for post-Second Temple Jews, one that would have given them great comfort.\nAccordingly, we should note that the Torah doesn’t speak at all about repentance in connection with Yom Kippur.  Our modern conception of Yom Kippur as a day of repentance was shaped by the rabbis. Without their brilliant foresight, Yom Kippur, would probably have been lost.",

An “uncertain guilt-offering” is brought when a person thinks he might have done something which he would be liable for karet if he did it intentionally, but isn’t sure if he really did it.  For instance, if he had relations with a woman and he doesn’t know if she was a menstruant or not, he brings an “uncertain guilt offering.”  This type of sacrifice doesn’t effect full atonement, because if he finds out that she really was a menstruant, meaning that he really did transgress, he will have to bring another sacrifice. The rabbis understand that the sacrifice causes the person who brings it to regret his sin and to make up his mind not to sin again.  In other words, sacrifices are like repentance.  Hence they effect atonement.",

The verses in Ezekiel talk about God’s redemption of the people of Israel, what we usually call the Messianic age.  Rabbi Akiva seems to be alluding to this ultimate cleansing of sin, one in which God will give us a “new heart” (v. 26). Rabbi Akiva also makes a pun on the word “mikveh” in Jeremiah the word in its context means hope, but means “ritual bath” in other places.  God acts as a purifier for Israel, cleansing us both in the here and now and in the redemptive future for which we long. Congratulations!  We have finished Yoma. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. If you’ve been following along with the Mishnah Yomit schedule then you have just completed Yom Kippur and in a couple of days Sukkot will begin.  We could not have asked for better timing this year!  Yoma contained a long description of how the day’s ritual was carried out in the Temple and it concluded by hinting at a message central to the world of the rabbis.  We no longer have a Temple, but through repentance, through prayer, through study, through acts of loving kindness and through the observance of the commandments we can maintain and repair our relationship with God.  I can’t think of any message more relevant to this time of year. As always, congratulations on learning another tractate of Mishnah.  May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more! Tomorrow we begin Sukkah."
