        "Introduction": [
            "There are two main topics covered in tractate Rosh Hashanah. The first is the sanctification of the new month and the new year.  By “sanctification” I refer to the court’s decision which day shall be the first of the new month or new year—this decision gives the day sanctity.  The second topic is the shofar and the liturgy on Rosh Hashanah.  ",
            "Today the Jewish lunar calendar is set—the day on which each month will begin is predetermined as are the lengths of each month. In mishnaic times the length of each month was not set. Rather each month they would determine when the new month would begin based on the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon.  If the witnesses came to testify on the thirtieth day of the previous month, then that day would become Rosh Hodesh (the first of the month) of the next month and it would turn out that the old month had only twenty-nine days. If witnesses did not come, or they came but their testimony was not accepted in time, then the previous month would have thirty days and the new month would begin on the thirty-first day.  Usually, the calendar would alternate between twenty-nine day months and thirty day months because a lunar month is about 29 ½ days long.  ",
            "The sanctification of the new month was done by an authorized court and it was done with quite a bit of ceremonial flourish, as we shall see.  We will also see some hotly contested disputes within the chapter concerning accepting testimony to sanctify the month. We need to realize that in the Second Temple period the calendar was one of the most divisive issues between sects of Jews. Some Jews used a solar calendar (notably the Dead Sea sect), whereas the Pharisees and subsequently the rabbis used a lunar calendar. This meant that different sect’s holidays fell at different times and it meant that people would have disagreed when holiday sacrifices should be offered at the Temple. ",
            "According to the Torah, Nisan, the month in which Pesah falls, is the first month of the year and not Tishrei, which is called by the Torah “the seventh month.”  The first day of the seventh month is referred to in Leviticus 23:23-25, “Speak to the children of Israel saying:  In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall observe complete rest, a sacred occasion commemorated with loud blasts.  You shall not work and you shall bring an offering by fire to the Lord.”  Numbers 29:1-6 further describes the day’s sacrifices, calling it “a day of blasts.”  In the Torah, this day is not called the first of the new year.",
            "Only in rabbinic tradition is this day called “Rosh Hashanah”, although as we will see in the first mishnah, there are also other days that are considered the beginnings of a new year.  We should also note that the concept that Rosh Hashanah is “the Day of Judgment” appears first in rabbinic literature.  This theme was probably derived from the atonement aspect of Yom Kippur. If Yom Kippur is the “Day of Atonement” then there must be a judgment which needs to be avoided.  In the Bible itself, Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah are unconnected holidays. ",
            "According to the Torah Rosh Hashanah is only one day.  However, because of the problem of not knowing ahead of time what day Rosh Hashanah falls on, in other words, not knowing whether the previous month (Elul) was twenty-nine days or thirty days, led to Rosh Hashanah always being observed for two days. This is also true for Rosh Hodesh when the previous month was a thirty day month—it too is observed for two days.  The difference is that Rosh Hashanah is observed on the first two days of Tishrei, whereas a two-day Rosh Hodesh is observed on the last day of the previous month and the first day of the new month.  This is at least partly because Elul now has only 29 days.  ",
            "A major portion of the last two chapters is dedicated to the laws of the shofar and to the special prayers on Rosh Hashanah.  These are still the two aspects of Rosh Hashanah most prominent in our lives.  We shall discuss them in far greater depth when we learn those chapters. ",
            "Good luck in learning Rosh Hashanah. It is an extremely interesting tractate—I’m sure you will enjoy it.     \n"

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis famous mishnah gives four new years and explains the halakhic significance of each of each of them.",
                    "<b>There are four new years:<br>The first of Nisan is the new year for kings and for festivals.</b>  The order of the new years in this mishnah reflects the order of the months in the Torah.  In the Torah, Nisan, the month in which Pesah falls, is considered to be the first month of the year, so it is listed here first. The first of Nisan is new year for the kings, which means that we count the years in which a king has ruled from the first of Nisan.  The reason why this is important is that in those times they would date their documents by the years in which the king had ruled.  In order for a document to be valid, therefore, one needed to know if which year of the king’s rule this was.  “For festivals” means that Pesah is considered to be the first festival of the year.   The reason that this is important is that it impacts someone who makes a vow to bring something to the Temple. Rabbi Shimon holds that he has three festivals to bring the vow-offering, and that the count of those three festivals begins on Pesah. So if he makes a vow after Pesah, he doesn’t begin counting the three festival time-limit until the following Pesah.",
                    "<b>The first of Elul is the new year for the tithe of beasts. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:  the first of Tishri.</b>  The first of Elul is the Rosh Hashanah for tithing animals. When tithing animals, one groups them by year.  The first of Elul is the beginning of the next year, so any animals born on or after this date count toward the next year’s tithe and not towards those animals that need to be tithed from the previous year.  Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon disagree concerning tithes. They hold that just as tithes for vegetables are fixed on the first of Tishri (see below), so too are tithes for animals.",
                    "<b>The first of Tishri is the new year for years, for shmitta and jubilee years, for planting and for [tithe of] vegetables.</b>  The first of Tishri, what we today call Rosh Hashanah, is the new year for “years.”  This means that when we count what year it is, we count from the first of Tishri.  This is how we still count the years today.  Many other commentators take this to mean that counts based on the rule of non-Jewish kings are based on Tishri being the start of the new year.  The shmitta (Sabbatical) and Jubilee years begin on the first of Tishri meaning from this date all of the prohibitions and regulations concerning the Sabbatical and Jubilee years begin to take effect.  This is also the new year for “planting” trees, meaning that we count the number of years a tree has grown starting on the first of Tishri. This is important in order to know when it stops being “orlah” fruit which is prohibited during the trees first three years. Finally, the first of Tishri is the Rosh Hashanah for the tithes of vegetables.  Vegetables that were picked before Tishri are not tithed with vegetables picked afterwards.",
                    "<b>The first of Shevat is the new year for trees, according to the words of Bet Shammai. Bet Hillel says:  on the fifteenth of that month.</b>  The two houses debate the date of the new year for trees: Bet Shammai holds that it is on the first of Shevat, and Bet Hillel holds that it is on the fifteenth (Tu B’shvat).  The importance of this new year is that fruit which has begun to sprout on the tree before this date is not tithed with fruit that spouts afterwards."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah lists four points of the year in which the world is judged as to the outcome of certain essential aspects of life.  As we shall see, three of them are connected to agricultural holidays and events, whereas the fourth, the judgment on Rosh Hashanah, is more of a moral/religious judgment.",
                    "<b>At four set times the world is judged:<br>On Pesah in respect to the produce.</b>  In the land of Israel, the grain harvest begins around Pesah time. Indeed, this is why the Omer offering, which is brought from the first barley harvested, begins to be offered on the second day of Pesah.  The mishnah teaches that on Pesah the world is judged as to how successful the produce harvest will be.",
                    "<b>On Shavuot in respect to the fruit of the tree.</b>  On Shavuot the harvest of the fruits of the tree begins.  Specifically, this seems to be when grapes begin to ripen. Hence, according to the rabbis this is when the world is judged as to the harvest of fruits which come from the tree.",
                    "<b>On Rosh Hashanah all the people of the world pass before Him like a division of soldier [a numerus], as it says, “He who fashions the hearts of them all, who discerns all their doings” (Psalms 33:15).</b>  This is the central section in this mishnah, the reason why this mishnah is here in Rosh Hashanah. This is the source where we learn for the first time that on Rosh Hashanah the world is judged.  The image that the mishnah creates is that all the people of the world, perhaps even non-Jews, come in front of God one at a time and God inspects them.  He is like their general and they are his soldiers, standing at attention and being judged by Him.  The word “numerus” was interpreted by Saul Lieberman, the premier Talmudic scholar of the past century, as referring to an army division.  The version in the mishnah was understood by later talmudic scholars who did not know Greek, as “kivne meron”, understood to refer to the sheep on the Meron mountain.  This led to the well-known image of people passing in front of God like sheep passing in front of a shepherd.  The point of the prooftext is that God who is the creator of the human heart, also looks at what a person does and judges each one according to his deeds.",
                    "<b>And on Sukkot they are judged in respect of rain.</b>  In the land of Israel, the rainy season begins on Sukkot.  Hence, on Sukkot the people of the world are judged as to how much rain will come. To this day, on Sukkot Jews begin to pray for rain and add into the Amidah an acknowledgement that God causes the wind to blow and the rain to come down.  Rain and prayers for rain is a topic to which we will return when we learn tracate Taanit."

Our mishnah teaches that they used to send out messengers from Jerusalem so that people who lived further away could also find out when Rosh Hodesh had been decreed.  However, they did not send these messengers out every month of the year, only on months which contained holidays.<br>Most of this mishnah is self-explanatory. Note that messengers do not need to go out for Shavuot because once one knows when Pesah falls, the date of Shavuot is known automatically.<br>Section two:  “The fast” refers to Tisha B’av, the Ninth of Av.<br>Section three:  Messengers would go out on Elul so that people would be able to celebrate Rosh Hashanah on the thirtieth day of Elul, lest that day turns out to be the first of Tishri.  They would celebrate Rosh Hashanah on the next day as well, lest Elul has thirty days.<br>Section four: On Tishri the messengers would go out so that people would know when Yom Kippur and Sukkot fall.<br>Section seven:  Pesah Sheni was the second chance for people to offer the pesah sacrifice if they did not offer it the first time (see Numbers 9:10-11 and Mishnah Pesahim 9:1).  After the destruction of the Temple this holiday lost any practical relevance.  We should note that by noting that when the Temple stood messengers went out for Pesah Sheni the mishnah also teaches that for all of the rest of the holidays the messengers still go out.  After the destruction of the Temple only Pesah Sheni has lost its relevance."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nAs we stated in the introduction, in mishnaic times they set the calendar each month based on the testimony of witnesses who would come to the central court and testified that they had seen the new moon.  Our mishnah teaches that on two months in order to testify that they had seen the new moon the witnesses may even profane Shabbat.  We shall explain what is special about these two months below.  What is critical is that the rabbis perceived it to be so critical that these witnesses come on time that they even allowed Shabbat to be profaned.  Shabbat might need to be profaned if, for instance, the witnesses had to travel beyond the Shabbat border limit (2000 cubits outside of the city) in order to get to Jerusalem to testify.",
                    "<b>On account of two months they profane Shabbat: on account of Nissan and Tishri, for on those months messengers go forth to Syria and in them the dates of the festivals are fixed.</b>  There are two months on which witnesses may come to testify even if they need to profane Shabbat Nissan and Tishri.  This is because on those days the dates of the holidays, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Pesah and Shavuot were set. Once we know when the first day of Nissan is we know when Pesah is, and we know when Shavuot will be as well.  Similarly, once we know when the first of Tishri falls, we know when Yom Kippur and Sukkot fall.  The messengers would go forth to Syria, meaning to the Diaspora, and let them know when the festivals would fall.  Therefore, it was critical that they find out what day Rosh Hodesh was as soon as possible.",
                    "<b>When the Temple stood they used to profane Shabbat for all the months, in order that the sacrifice might be offered on the right day.</b>  In the Temple there was a special sacrifice offered on Rosh Hodesh.  Hence, it was essential that the witnesses testify on time every month so that the sacrifice would be offered on the correct day.  Hence, they could profane Shabbat in order to get to Jerusalem to testify concerning any of the months. ."

                    "<b>Whether [the new moon] was seen clearly or was not seen clearly, they profane Shabbat on account of it. Rabbi Yose says:  if it was been seen clearly they do not profane Shabbat on account of it.</b> According to the first opinion in the mishnah, witnesses can profane Shabbat in order to come to Jerusalem and testify regardless of whether the new moon was seen clearly or not.  Rabbi Yose holds that if the new moon was seen clearly in a place somewhat far away from Jerusalem, then it was probably seen clearly in Jerusalem as well.  In such a case witnesses would have seen it in Jerusalem and since they live close, they would not have to profane Shabbat in order to testify. Therefore those outside of Jerusalem should assume that those closer had testified and that they don’t need to come and profane Shabbat. The other sages disagree, reasoning that if you tell witnesses not to profane Shabbat when the new moon is seen clearly, they might end up not profaning Shabbat when the moon is not seen clearly, i.e. when they should profane Shabbat. Anything that might lead to witnesses not coming when their testimony is needed is discouraged."

Rabbi Akiva detains the because he reasons that there is no need for so many witnesses to testify; after all, two would seem to be sufficient.  Commentators add that this transpired on Shabbat.  Rabbi Akiva did not think it was necessary for forty pairs of witnesses to profane Shabbat, when only two were needed, so he held the unneeded pairs back. Rabban Gamaliel rebuked Rabbi Akiva for his actions.  Witnesses who were told not to go to Jerusalem to testify would not go next time they see the new moon, and perhaps that time they would actually be needed.  This is what he means when he says, “cause them to stumble.”"

However, some sages, as we shall see below, hold that in the case of testifying regarding the new moon the joint testimony of relatives is acceptable.",

The priests accepted his evidence and that of his son and disqualified his slave. But when they appeared before the court they accepted his evidence and that of his slave and disqualified his son.</b>  Through the story in this section we learn that there was a debate between the priests and the “court” of sages concerning two issues regarding testimony as to the new moon: the ability of relatives to jointly testify and the ability of a freed slave.  The priests accepted the evidence of the relatives, probably because each of these people is himself fit to testify.  The sages, which the mishnah calls here “the court,” accepted that of the freed slave, because they generally hold that freed slaves were allowed to testify. There is some interesting history which we may glean from this mishnah.  First of all, the mishnah portrays two courts in Jerusalem, one that was made up of priests and one made up of others who evidently were not priests. The non-priest court is portrayed as being more authoritative.  Second, it is noteworthy that the priests reject that of the freed slave while the other court accepts it.  This may connect in general with the high value the priests placed on lineage."

Such a person cannot testify since he is known to be a liar, especially with regards to monetary matters.  Another reason is that he doesn’t participate constructively in building society. 2)  A usurer.  He is also probably considered to not be trustworthy in monetary matters. 3)  A pigeon racer.  Racing pigeons was a form of gambling. 4)  Those who sell produce grown during the Seventh Year. According to Lev. 25:5-7 produce grown in the fields during the Seventh Year may be eaten by its owners, but it may not be sold.  One who therefore sells Seventh Year produce is engaging in forbidden business practices which according to our mishnah make him not trustworthy to testify or act as a judge. 5)  A slave referring to a slave who has not been freed.",

The witnesses were allowed to travel for up to an entire night and one day in order to get to Jerusalem, meaning if they saw the new moon in the evening when Shabbat began, and they were far enough away that they would have to walk the entire night and all day and then just get there when Shabbat was over, they were still allowed to go.  Of course, if they lived farther away than they couldn’t come because they wouldn’t make it in time anyway. The rabbis’ adamancy that one must go to Jerusalem to testify and that one can break Shabbat in order to do so is justified by a midrash.  The Torah says that the appointed times, the festivals, must be proclaimed at their appointed time.  This is understood by the rabbis to mean that it is essential that the court declare the new moon on time so that the festivals would fall at the correct time.

This mishnah alludes to this strife when it relates that the minim, a generic rabbinic term for sectarians, tried to disrupt the process by sending false witnesses. It sounds like they wanted to trick the Pharisees into declare the new month on the wrong date.  Even though the sectarians in this mishnah probably used a solar calendar, they still wanted to disrupt the Pharisaic/rabbinic calendar.

We should note that this mishnah is probably more “historiographical” than “historical.”  That is to say, the mishnah teaches us how to view history, more than it teaches us what actually happened.

A person is not allowed to go more than 2000 cubits outside of the city in which he began Shabbat.  If he does so, he is stuck in his place and can’t walk more than another four cubits.  In the case in our mishnah, witnesses came to Jerusalem to testify on Shabbat. This was permitted and indeed encouraged, as we saw in 1:4-5.  Our mishnah teaches that originally such a person could not leave the courtyard because a person who leaves his Shabbat border cannot move more than four cubits in any direction.  The courtyard which was enclosed was considered to be all within four cubits. However, this would discourage people from coming to Jerusalem to testify because they would know that they would be stuck there the whole day. In order to encourage people to come to testify, Rabban Gamaliel the elder, a sage who lived while the Temple still stood, decreed that they could move about like the rest of the people of the town.  This means that they could move around all of Jerusalem and even go outside of the city 2000 cubits in any direction. The mishnah goes on to say that the same ruling applies to anyone who left his Shabbat border for a permitted reason.  So a midwife who leaves her Shabbat border limit to go and deliver a child may now go all around the city she came into and may go 2000 cubits in all direction.  The same is true for anyone who leaves his Shabbat border limit in order to save property. Since we want to encourage people to do so, they are allowed this concession."

The examination would consist of several questions which would ascertain that the witnesses had actually seen the new moon.  At the time of the new month (the molad, in Hebrew) the moon is found at sundown in the west near the sun.  From that time on it goes further east away from the sun, until at the fifteenth of the month it is in the east opposite the sun.  Right before the new moon it is west of the sun and it sets before the sun such that it looks as if it is “in front of the sun.”  After the new month (the molad) it sets after the sun and is further from the horizon and it looks as if it is “after the sun.”  Therefore, if he says that he saw it “in front of the sun,” he has not seen the new moon and his testimony is rejected. One who stands looking west at sunset, where he might see the new moon at the right time of the month has the north to his right and the south to his left.

Remember, a month can have only 29 or 30 days. Rabbi Elazar bar Zadok says that the ceremony was performed only if the month was sanctified at its proper time, meaning on the thirtieth day.  If the new moon was not seen on this day, then it is as if heaven had sanctified the month by allowing it to last the full thirty days. Since heaven sanctified it, the court does not perform the ritual declaration. We should note that beneath the surface of this mishnah we again can detect the conflict between the court determining the new month by making a ritual declaration and the calendar being set by the cycles of nature that is heaven sanctifying the new month.

Rabbi Dosa’s midrash teaches that the court that stands at every generation is equal in authority to that of Moses and his court.  This is the ultimate statement of rabbinic authority.

Since they themselves are not obligated to blow the shofar, they cannot blow the shofar in order for others to hear and thereby fulfill their obligation. This is true in all cases a person who is not obligated to perform a commandment cannot himself perform that commandment on behalf of others.  One must be personally obligated in order to fulfill the more communal role of fulfilling a mitzvah for other people."

After all, as we shall see, some places did blow the shofar on Shabbat. It seems to me that there may have been a desire among the sages to prevent the celebration of Rosh Hashanah from overshadowing that of Shabbat.  In the Talmud they provide a midrashic reason why one shouldn’t blow the shofar on Shabbat.",
                    "<b>If Yom Tov of Rosh Hashanah fell on Shabbat, they would blow the shofar in the Temple but not in the country.</b>  There are two different explanations for “Temple” and “country.” Some commentators explain “Temple” to refer to all of Jerusalem and “country” to refer to anywhere outside of Jerusalem. According to this interpretation, they allowed the shofar to be blown in Jerusalem because there they would know whether the new moon had been sanctified.  In other words, they would know for certain whether it was Rosh Hashanah.  Outside of Jerusalem they couldn’t be sure, so they wouldn’t blow the shofar on Rosh Hashanah.  Assumedly, at this period there were already two days of Rosh Hashanah so that they could blow the second day. The other explanation is that “Temple” refers to the Temple itself, and “country” refers to all places outside of the Temple. They allowed the shofar to be blown in the Temple because rabbinically prohibited activities are allowed on Shabbat in the Temple.  However, this interpretation does not fit particularly well with the mishnah which we shall learn tomorrow.",
                    "<b>After the destruction of the Temple, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakai decreed that it should be blown [on Shabbat] in every place where there was a court.</b>  This begins a series of decrees made by Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, one of the leaders of the rabbis after the destruction of the Second Temple. The other decrees will appear in the following mishnayot. Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that the shofar should be blown on Shabbat in all places where a rabbinic court, according to some a Sanhedrin, sat.  This in essence bequeathed the authority of the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem on all subsequent courts, no matter where they sat.",

Rabbi Eliezer may be claiming that it is only Rabban Yohanan’s personal authority that allowed him to make such a decree.  Other courts, which will not be able to count Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai as one of them, will not have such authority. The other rabbis reject Rabbi Eliezer’s statement.  The decree bestowed authority on all subsequent courts and not just on the one in Yavneh. We might say that the authority is vested in the office and not in the individual rabbi, charismatic and learned as he may be."

However, in Jerusalem they would blow the shofar on Shabbat not only in Jerusalem but in all of the surrounding areas as well.  This distinction between Jerusalem and Yavneh may have been an attempt to preserve the uniqueness of the authority of Jerusalem and its court. While Yavneh may have received some of the authority of Jerusalem, it was still not as great. The beginning of the mishnah implies that there was another way in which Jerusalem was greater than Yavneh, besides that listed in the Mishnah.  The Talmud asks what this was, and answers that in Jerusalem they would blow the shofar on Shabbat both in front of the court and not in front of the court.  In Yavneh the shofar was blown on Shabbat only in front of the court.  This may be a way of saying that while the court in Yavneh was authoritative, the city did not have inherent sacredness, as did Jerusalem."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn the previous mishnah we learned of a decree that Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai made after the destruction of the Temple.  The next two mishnayot contain other such decrees.\nIf this mishnah seems familiar it is because we just learned it in Sukkah 3:12.  The below commentary is the same as that found there.\nLeviticus 23:40 reads, “On the first day you shall take...and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.”  The beginning of the verse states “on the first day” and the end of the verse says, “seven days.”  From here the rabbis derived that the mitzvah of taking the lulav is for a different amount of time in different places. They read the second half of the verse as applying to the Temple, “before the Lord your God.”  Hence, the lulav was taken up for seven days in the Temple.  Outside of the Temple, or according to other commentaries, outside of Jerusalem, the lulav was taken for only one day.",
                    "<b>In earlier times the lulav was taken for seven days in the Temple, and in the provinces for one day only.</b>  When the Temple still stood the lulav was taken in the Temple (or in Jerusalem) for seven days and outside of the Temple for only one day, as explained in the introduction.",
                    "<b>When the temple was destroyed, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that the lulav should be taken in the provinces for seven days in memory of the Temple,</b>  However, when the Temple was destroyed, there was a problem.  If people only observed the commandment for one day, they would soon forget that originally the commandment was observed for seven days, at least in some places.  Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, one of the leading rabbinic figures after the destruction of the Temple, decreed therefore that the lulav should be taken up for seven days, in memory of the Temple.",
                    "<b>[He also decreed] that on the whole of the day of waving it be forbidden [to eat the new produce].</b>  Having related one of the decrees that Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai made after the destruction of the Temple, the mishnah now relates another, similar decree.  We need to note a little bit of background to understand this.  On the second day of Pesah, when the Temple still stood, the Omer offering of barley was harvested and brought to the Temple and waved by a priest.  After this day, it was permitted to eat from the new grain harvest (see Leviticus 23:9-14).  Since people outside of Jerusalem would not know precisely when the Omer had been offered, they would wait at least half of the day before they would eat from the new harvest.  When the Temple was destroyed and they could no longer offer the Omer, the rabbis derived from the Torah that the new produce could be eaten as soon as the second day of Pesah began.  In other words, without an Omer sacrifice the day itself allowed the new harvest.  Again, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai perceived a problem.  If people would eat from the new harvest immediately on the 16th of Nissan, when the Temple is rebuilt they would forget that they need to wait until the Omer is offered.  Therefore he decreed that the new produce could not be eaten for the entire day. It is interesting to note that the rabbis who lived close to the destruction of the Temple believed that it would speedily be rebuilt.  Just as they began working on the rebuilding of the First Temple only 70 years after its destruction, rabbis who lived in the first and early second century probably assumed that their Temple would also be rebuilt in a short time.  However, after the Bar Kokhba revolt was crushed, it probably began to dawn on many that the realistic chances of the Temple being speedily rebuilt were not good.  The hopes of course never died, but this type of legislative activity making decrees lest the Temple be rebuilt quickly, were more characteristic of the pre Bar Kokhba period."

                    "<b>Originally they used to accept testimony with regard to the new moon during the whole day.</b>  Originally, it didn’t matter when during the day the witnesses came to testify that they had seen the new moon there testimony was always accepted.",
                    "<b>On one occasion the witnesses were late in arriving, and the Levites went wrong in the daily hymn.</b>  The problem with accepting witnesses all day is that when witnesses successfully testify they turn the current day into Rosh Hodesh, or in the case of Tishri, Rosh Hashanah. If they come late in the day, it may be difficult to correctly observe the special Rosh Hodesh rituals because time is simply running.  The mishnah relates that this happened one time.  The witnesses came late in the day and the Levites in the Temple sang the wrong Psalm.  The Levites would sing a Psalm while the Tamid (Daily) sacrifice was being offered.  There was a different song depending on whether it was a regular day or whether it was Rosh Hodesh. In the morning they sang the regular Psalm for that day, and then because the witnesses hadn’t yet come they sang the same Psalm for the afternoon Tamid. When the witnesses came, it turned out that they never sang the correct Psalm.",
                    "<b>They therefore decreed that testimony should be accepted only until the afternoon [sacrifice].</b>  They therefore decreed that the testimony of the witnesses would only be accepted until minhah time, which was the time when they would offer the tamid sacrifice (see Pesahim 5:1).",
                    "<b>If witnesses came after the afternoon sacrifice that day should be kept as holy and also the next day.</b>  This section refers to Rosh Hashanah, which is not only Rosh Hodesh but also a sacred holiday.  On Rosh Hashanah they would observe the thirtieth day of the previous month as a holiday meaning they wouldn’t work.  If witnesses came before minhah, then that day would count as Rosh Hashanah, and the next day would not be Rosh Hashanah.  If they came later than minhah, then that day would not have counted as Rosh Hashanah (even though they already refrained from work) and the following day will be observed as Rosh Hashanah.  This is the origins of the custom to observe Rosh Hashanah for two days.",
                    "<b>After the destruction of the temple Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that testimony with regard to the new moon should be received during the whole day.</b>  After the destruction of the Temple there was no more need to worry about the Levites singing the wrong song.  Therefore, Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai restored the rule to its original state, and allowed the acceptance of testimony for the entire day.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Joshua ben Korha said: this further did Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai decree, that not matter where the head of the court might be, the witnesses should have to go only to the place of the assembly.</b>  According to Rabbi Joshua ben Korcha there was yet another decree made by Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai.  Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai decreed that when the witnesses came to testify all they had to do was come to the place of assembly, which is where the court sat.  They did not have to chase after the head of the court if he was in another place.  This decree seems to be another way of saying that the authority of the court is determinative and not the individual authority of its leader."

It contains the three blessings which begin every Amidah “patriarchs”, which concludes ‘magen Avraham’; “powers”, which concludes ‘mehayeh hametim’; and “the sanctification of the day”, which concludes ‘hael hakadosh’, or ‘hamelekh hakadosh’ between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.\nThe Amidah ends with the same three prayers with which it always ends, “blessing of the Temple service (begins with R’tzeh) and “thanksgiving” (begins with modim) and the blessing of the priests (sim shalom it is called the blessing of the priests because it begins with the priestly blessing).\nThere are three middle blessings, but the rabbis in our mishnah disagree about what these are.  There are actually four topics which are mentioned in these three blessings. The first is the sanctification of the day, a blessing said on every festival. The other three are unique to Rosh Hashanah. They are “kingship (Malkhuyot)”, “Remembrance (Zikhronot)” and “Shofarot.”  Each of the sections contains the recitation of relevant biblical verses, along with a liturgical composition and a concluding blessing.\nIn our mishnah the rabbis argue about the composition of these three middle blessings.  We should emphasize that they agree concerning the content, and they agree that there are three and not four blessings. They also all agree that we blow the shofar three times during the Amidah.  They also agree that “kingship” is not a separate blessing.  In the points of agreement are far greater than the points of disagreement.

That is to say, they are prohibitions that are less significant than those prohibited by the Torah.  Nevertheless, the mishnah states that one does not transgress these prohibitions in order to be able to blow the shofar.  For instance, if one needs to go past the Shabbat border limit (2000 cubits outside of the city) to get a shofar or to hear one blown, one should not do so.  If the shofar is under a pile of rocks, one may not clear them away in order to get to them.  One may not climb a tree if the shofar was in a tree (this is beginning to sound like a famous Dr. Seuss book I would not hear it under rocks, I would not hear it in a tree). Nor may one ride an animal or swim in water to get to the shofar.  The important issue here is the principle one does not transgress any commandments in order to hear the shofar.",

A knife that is typically used to cut something like a shofar would be prohibited from the Torah, while one not typically used for such purposes would be prohibited derabanan, a lesser prohibition.",
                    "<b>But if he wants to pour wine or water into it he may do so.</b>  One may pour wine or water into the shofar in order to improve its sound. This is not considered to be a violation of the Shabbat and Yom Tov prohibition of “making a vessel.”",
                    "<b>They need not prevent children from blowing the shofar [on Rosh Hashanah]; on the contrary, they may help them until they learn how to blow.</b>  Children are not obligated to hear or blow the shofar on Rosh Hashanah. Since they are not obligated, we might have thought that they should not blow the shofar at all because the shofar is a form of work on Rosh Hashanah. The mishnah dispels this notion and states that not only do we not stop children from blowing the shofar, but we encourage them to practice and we teach them until they know how to blow.  The Talmud adds that even on Shabbat we can help them practice.",
                    "<b>One who is just practicing has not fulfilled his obligation, and the one hears [the blast made] by another when practicing has not fulfilled his obligation.</b>  Since the previous section discussed practicing, this mishnah concludes by teaching that practicing does not count as blowing the shofar in order to fulfill one’s obligation.  A person who on Rosh Hashanah blows the shofar as practice has not fulfilled his obligation because he did not have the proper intention.  Similarly, one who hears the shofar from a person practicing has not fulfilled his obligation, because one must hear the shofar being blown by someone who intends to fulfill his and others’ obligation."

                    "<b>The order of the blasts:  three sets of three each.</b>  There are nine core blasts of the shofar during the Mussaf  Amidah three during each section, malkhuyot, zikhronot and shofarot.  Each set consists of one tekiah, one teruah, followed by another tekiah.  A set therefore consists of a teruah, preceded by and followed by a tekiah.",
                    "<b>The length of a teki’ah is equal to three teru'ahs, and the length of a teru'ah is equal to three yevavot.</b>  A tekiah is a longer blast than a teruah and a teruah is a longer blast that a yevavah, which is a short staccato blast. In the Talmud there is a doubt about whether a teruah consists of a few medium length notes or a greater number of staccato notes.  Today we call the few medium length notes “shevarim” and we call the shorter notes “teruah.”  Since it is unclear which we should do, we do both (Jews love to compromise).  We also do one set that is “shevarim-teruah” because a teruah may include both the shevarim and the teruah.  This doubt concerning the doubt about how the blasts are to be done is the main way in which the original nine blasts have been expanded.  The service also includes sets of shofar blasts that are not done throughout Mussaf.",
                    "<b>If one prolonged the first teki'ah so that it went directly into the second, it counts only as one.</b>  At the end of one set of blasts is a tekiah. There is also a tekiah at the beginning of another set. If the shofar blower starts a tekiah at the end of one set and continues to blow long enough that it could have counted for the tekiah at the beginning of the next set, then it only counts as one tekiah.  Each shofar blast must be integral and a doubly long blast counts only as one.",
                    "<b>One who has blessed [recited the Amidah] and then a shofar is given to him, he sounds a teki'ah teru'ah teki'ah three times.</b>  As we stated above, the shofar blasts are integrated into the Amidah. However, the obligation to blow the shofar is independent of the obligation to recite the Mussaf prayer.  Therefore, if one does not have a shofar while reciting the Amidah, and then gets one later on, he should blow the shofar even though he has already recited the Amidah.",
                    "<b>Just as the shaliah tzibbur is obligated, so every single individual is obligated. Rabban Gamaliel says:  the shaliah tzibbur (communal prayer causes the whole congregation to fulfill their obligation.</b>  The final section contains an extremely important debate concerning the function of the shaliach tzibbur, literally translated as “the agent of the community.”  According to the first opinion, every person is individually obligated to recite the entire Amidah.  The Talmud comments that according to this opinion, the function of the shaliach tzibbur is to fulfill the obligation for a person who doesn’t know how to recite the Amidah.  One who knows how to recite the Amidah cannot have his obligation fulfilled on his behalf by the shaliah tzibbur. According to Rabban Gamaliel the shaliach tzibbur’s recitation of the Amidah fulfills the obligation of the entire community. The question then must be asked why should the other members of the community even bother reciting the Amidah?  The answer given is that while the rest of the community recites the Amidah, the shaliah tzibbur has time to prepare to recite the Amidah. Congratulations!  We have finished Rosh Hashanah. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Mishnah Rosh Hashanah had two main sections, one about the sanctification of the new month, Rosh Hodesh, and the other about Rosh Hashanah itself.  The Jewish calendar and its connection to the moon should remain an important way in which we connect ourselves to the cycles of nature, to the waxing and the waning of the new moon.  In modern times, women have reclaimed Rosh Hodesh as a woman’s holiday.  I hope that learning this mishnah has aided in these celebrations and as a reminder to everyone that Rosh Hodesh is not just the recitation of Hallel but is a monthly renewal of our calendar. Rosh Hashanah remains one of the central holidays in the Jewish calendar.  I hope that by learning the Mishnah we can help return to the holidays roots which are a reminder of God’s kingship and God’s salvation. And again, as always, congratulations on learning another tractate of Mishnah.  We are getting close to having finished half of the Mishnah.  May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more! Tomorrow we begin Taanit."
