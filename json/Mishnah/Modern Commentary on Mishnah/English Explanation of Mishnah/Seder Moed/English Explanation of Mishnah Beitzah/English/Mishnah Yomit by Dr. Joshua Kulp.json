            "Tractate Betzah (Egg) teaches the laws governing Yom Tov (the festival), which means the first and last days of Pesah, the first day of Sukkot, Shmini Atzeret and Shavuot.  It is usually called “Betzah” after the first word of the first mishnah, although it was alternatively called Tractate Yom Tov.  ",
            "The Torah does not provide much information about the special laws of Yom Tov, those which would distinguish it from Shabbat.  They are mostly contained in Exodus 12:16, “And on the first day you shall celebrate a sacred occasion and on the last day, a sacred occasion; no work at all shall be done on them; only what every person is to eat, that alone may be prepared by you.”  In other words, Yom Tov is like Shabbat in that work is prohibited, with one major exception—one can prepare food.  Although this verse relates specifically to Pesah, it was interpreted as referring to all of the festival days. ",
            "Not all food preparations were permitted on Yom Tov.  The general explanation is that all preparatory work that could have been done before Yom Tov without any loss to the quality of the food must be done before Yom Tov.  For instance, one cannot harvest wheat on Yom Tov, but one can knead and bake dough.  One cannot trap an animal on Yom Tov but one can slaughter, skin, salt and cut up the meat.  Lighting a fire is permitted, as is carrying from domain to domain because these actions are typically involved in preparing food. ",
            "One of the reasons that one was allowed to prepare food on Yom Tov was that Yom Tov was supposed to be a big celebration.  The festival was supposed to be sanctified by eating and drinking and without being able to prepare fresh food (remember they had no refrigeration), the celebration would be lessened."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe first part of the first mishnah of Betzah is about its namesake, an egg born on Yom Tov. The second part is associated with the first part because both contain debates between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel, and in both Bet Hillel rules strictly.",
                    "<b>An egg laid on Yom Tov: Bet Shammai say: it may be eaten [on the same day]; But Bet Hillel say: it may not be eaten [until the day is over].</b>  According to Bet Shammai, just as it is permitted to slaughter a chicken on Yom Tov, it is also permitted to eat an egg that is laid on Yom Tov.  In other words, the chicken and everything in it is permitted on Yom Tov.  In contrast, Bet Hillel hold that while the chicken itself is permitted, the egg that is laid is prohibited.  The egg is what is called “nolad” it is born, or new, something that was not there when Yom Tov began and hence was not set aside for use at the beginning of Yom Tov. This prohibition is similar to muktzeh the idea that something that was not set aside before Yom Tov to be used on Yom Tov may not be used on Yom Tov.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai say: [the quantity of] leaven is of the size of an olive and leavened bread is of the size of a date; But Bet Hillel say: both are of the size of an olive.</b>  Exodus 13:7 says, “No leavened bread shall be seen with you and no leaven shall be found in all your territory.”  The verse mentions two things:  the leavening agent (starter dough) and the leavened bread, both of which are prohibited.  According to Bet Shammai the point of the verse is to teach that the two prohibitions are different.  Leaven is prohibited at the size of an olive, whereas leavened bread is prohibited at a larger amount, the size of a date.  Beth Hillel hold that in both cases an olive’s worth is prohibited.  Note that smaller amounts are not permitted either.  A smaller amount is still forbidden but one who consumes a smaller amount has not transgressed the Biblical prohibition of leaven or leavened bread on Passover."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah deals with slaughtering animals on Yom Tov.",
                    "<b>He who slaughters a wild animal or a bird on a festival   Bet Shammai says: he may dig with a pronged tool and cover up [the blood], but Bet Hillel says: he may not slaughter unless he has had earth made ready.</b>  According to Leviticus 17:13, when one slaughters an undomesticated animal or any type of fowl the blood must be poured out of the animal and covered with earth.  One who slaughters an undomesticated animal or fowl on the festival has a problem.  Although it is permitted to slaughter, if he doesn’t have any prepared earth to cover the blood newly dug earth is “muktzeh” and cannot be used.  Nevertheless, Bet Shammai permits one to dig up new earth and cover the blood.  Bet Hillel says one cannot slaughter unless one has earth already prepared.",
                    "<b>But they agree that if he did slaughter he should dig with a pronged tool and cover up [the blood, and] that the ashes of a stove count as being prepared for the holiday.</b>  However, they all agree that if he had already slaughtered the animal, even though Bet Hillel says he should not have done so without already prepared earth, he may still dig new earth to cover the blood.  This is because the principle of muktzeh is only rabbinically ordained and the obligation to cover the blood is Biblical.  When one has two competing commandments, one rabbinic and one Biblical, the latter takes precedence.  The two houses also agree that the ashes in the oven are considered prepared for the festival, in other words they are not muktzeh.  Since people used these ashes for various purposes, we can make the assumption that before the festival began he knew in his mind that he would use these ashes."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah continues with two more debates between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel over what types of food preparations one can do on Yom Tov. Today’s mishnah again deals with muktzeh, the concept that something that was designated for use on Yom Tov or Shabbat may not subsequently be used then.  The specific topic is fetching pigeon-doves from a dovecote in order to eat them on Yom Tov.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: one may not carry a ladder [on Yom Tov] from one dovecote to another, but he may incline it from one pigeon-hole to another. But Bet Hillel permits [this].</b>  In ancient Israel dovecotes were typically underground caves with many holes carved into the walls, each hole housing a dove.  There would be ladders inside the dovecote so that the owner could reach the doves situated high up.  According to Bet Shammai one may not move a ladder from one dovecote to another on Yom Tov, however one may move the ladder from one hole to the other within the dovecote.  Bet Hillel is more lenient in this case and permits one to move the ladder even from one dovecote to the other.  One cogent explanation for this debate is that Bet Shammai prohibits moving the ladder from one dovecote to another lest it look like he is bringing the ladder to the shop to get it fixed.  Bet Hillel is not concerned since everyone should know why he would be moving the ladder.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: one may not take [doves] unless he has shaken [them] the day before [Yom Tov]: But Bet Hillel says: he stands and declares: this one or that one I am taking.</b>  Doves that were not set aside to be slaughtered and then eaten on Yom Tov are muktzeh and may not be used on Yom Tov.  However, if they are designated before Yom Tov to be slaughtered on Yom Tov, one may use them.  In this mishnah Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel debate how one designates before Yom Tov that he will slaughter certain birds on the next day.  According to Bet Shammai one must designate the birds by physically lifting each one up and moving it around. This demonstrates that he intends to use that specific pigeon the next day (if only the pigeon knew that tomorrow won’t be such a Yom Tov for him).  Bet Hillel says that the designation is verbal he stands in front of the pigeons and says that he will use these pigeons (good thing they don’t know Hebrew)."

                [
                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn yesterday’s mishnah we learned that in order to slaughter and eat doves on Yom Tov one must designate them for use before Yom Tov begins.  Otherwise they are muktzeh.  Our mishnah discusses what happens if he designated doves before Yom Tov but then is not sure that the doves that he finds in the nest or dovecote are the same ones.",
                    "<b>If he designated black [doves] but found [on Yom Tov] white ones, white [doves] but found black ones, two but found three, they are [all] forbidden.</b>  If the doves which he finds are a different color from those that he designated it is obvious that they are not the same doves that he designated the previous day.  If he designated two doves and there are now three there, one of the doves is certainly muktzeh.  The problem is that he doesn’t know which one because all three look alike (I wonder if doves think all humans look alike).  Hence they are all prohibited.",
                    "<b>[If he designated] three but found two, they are permitted.</b>  If he designated three but finds only two we can assume that one flew off and that the other two are the same ones he designated.  Hence they are permitted.",

But if none were there except these, they are permitted.</b>  If the doves are found outside of the nest but he designated them in the nest, then they may not be the same doves.  If there is another nearby dovecote then he must be concerned about this possibility and he may not use those doves.  However, if there are no nearby dovecotes then he can assume that these doves just found their way out and he may use them."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah continues with four more debates between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel on the laws of Yom Tov.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: one may not remove shutters on Yom Tov. But Bet Hillel permits even to return them to their place.</b>  In mishnaic times the shutters which were used to close windows and closets were removable.  Bet Shammai forbade removing them because they considered this similar to tearing down a building, a forbidden labor on Shabbat and Yom Tov.  All the more so they would hold that putting the shutters back in their place is forbidden because it is similar to “building”.  Bet Hillel holds that it is permitted even to put the shutters back in their place.  Bet Hillel’s general principle is that if an activity is permitted because it is done in the preparation of food, then it is permitted even when it is done for another purpose.  Removing a shutter to take food out of a closet is permitted therefore removing shutters is always permitted, even if it is not for the sake of removing food.   Bet Hillel even allows returning the shutter to its place, because if it were prohibited people would hesitate to remove them, knowing that they would not be able to put them back in their place afterwards.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: one may not take a pestle even to cut up meat on it. But Bet Hillel permits [it].</b>  A pestle is a wooden board used to grind things which cannot be ground on Yom Tov because they can be ground the day before.  Bet Shammai says that the pestle cannot even be used for things that can be done on Yom Tov such as cutting up meat.  The pestle is completely muktzeh because its general use is for something that is prohibited.  Bet Hillel disagrees and holds that even though it is usually used during the week for things that cannot be done on Yom Tov, it may be used on Yom Tov for something that is permitted.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: one may not place a hide in front of one who treads upon it nor may he even lift it up unless there is an olive’s worth of flesh on it. But Bet hillel permit it.</b>  Once one has slaughtered and skinned an animal Bet Shammai prohibits one from giving the hide over to someone who will tread on it to prepare it for processing.  Indeed, Bet Shammiai add that he may not even touch the removed hide. Since the hide is not food, it becomes muktzeh.   One may touch the hide only if it has some flesh on it, because then it is considered “food.”  Bet Hillel however allows one to give a hide over to someone who will tread on it since if this was not permitted people wouldn’t slaughter animals on Yom Tov because the valuable hides would be ruined by waiting until the next day to begin working on them.  This would result in a reduction of the rejoicing on Yom Tov because there would be no fresh meat.  It is noteworthy that Bet Hillel allows activities that would seemingly be prohibited if they contribute to the celebration of Yom Tov.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: one may not carry out an infant or a lulav or a Torah scroll into the public domain. But Bet Hillel permit [it].</b>  According to Bet Shammai carrying something through the public domain is permitted on Yom Tov only in a case where one carries in order to prepare or eat food.  Carrying a child, a lulav or a Torah scroll is not done for eating and hence it is prohibited.  Bet Hillel again permits this.  Since carrying is permitted in some cases (for food) it is permitted in other cases as well.  However, Bet Hillel limits this to cases which involve a mitzvah or some other benefit.  Taking a child for a stroll is pleasurable (as long as they’re not screaming their little heads off).  The lulav and the Torah scroll are for mitzvot.  To carry something with no purpose is however forbidden even according to Bet Hillel."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn this mishnah Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel debate whether one may carry to a priest hallah and priestly gifts on Yom Tov.  Hallah is dough which one must separate from the dough that one kneads to bake bread (Numbers 15:17-21).  Priestly gifts refers to the parts of a sacrificial animal which must be given to the priest (Deuteronomy 18:3).",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: one may not take hallah or priestly gifts to a priest on Yom Tov, whether they were separated on the day before or on that day. But Bet Hillel permits it.</b>  In this first section we learn that Bet Shammai prohibits carrying the hallah and priestly gifts to the priest, whether they were separated on that day or earlier, whereas Bet Hillel permits this.  The reasons for this debate come in the following mishnah.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai said them: An analogy [supports our view]: hallah and priestly gifts go to the priest and terumah is [likewise] goes to the priest; just as one may not take [to the priest] terumah so one may not take [to him] priestly gifts. Bet Hillel said to them: No! If you say in the case of terumah which he has not the right to separate, will you say [the same] with respect to priestly gifts which he is permitted to separate?</b>  We now learn Bet Shammai’s reasoning.  They compare hallah and priestly gifts to terumah, the portion of one’s produce that one separates and gives to the priest.  Terumah may not be separated on Yom Tov because it can be separated from one’s produce on the day before.  Since one is not allowed to separate terumah on Yom Tov it is also forbidden to carry it to the priest.  Bet Shammai reasons that the same holds true for the other things which one gives to a priest they too cannot be carried to the priest on Yom Tov. Bet Hillel critiques this analogy.  One cannot carry terumah to a priest precisely because one cannot separate it on Yom Tov.  However, one may separate hallah and priestly gifts on Yom Tov and therefore one is allowed to carry them to the priest as well.  The reason that one may separate hallah and priestly gifts on Yom Tov is that one can slaughter an animal and knead dough on Yom Tov, and when one does so the gifts and hallah must be separated."

Normally spices are crushed with a stone pestle on Yom Tov they need to use a wooden pestle.  When crushing salt he shouldn’t use a pestle at all, rather he should use a small earthenware cruse and a wooden soup ladle.",

Rather all that he is allowed to do is sort out the beans and either eat them immediately, or put them in water to cook them if they are the type of bean that requires cooking.

The vessel was then immersed in a pure mikveh until the top of the vessel just touched the water from the mikveh. The reason that a stone vessel was used was to make sure that this was not done in order to purify the vessel, which as we learned yesterday, both Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel prohibit. They both agree that one should not fully immerse the vessel because that would be similar to immersing an unclean vessel in order to purify it.  In other words, only the water may be purified but not the vessels.  This is also taken to mean that one should not do this with a wooden vessel because wooden vessels become impure through the contact with the unclean water and then they would require immersion.",

For instance, if one immersed his vessels to purify them with the intent of using them for non-sacred things, such as regular oil, and then decided he wanted to use them to make terumah wine, he needs to immerse the vessels again.  Our mishnah teaches that this is permitted on Shabbat before Yom Tov because the vessels were in any case pure before they were immersed. A person who is pure and is eating non-sacred food with one eating company and then wants to eat terumah with another company must first immerse.  Again, this immersion is permitted on Yom Tov even according to Bet Shammai because the person was already pure."

Part of the sacrifice would be offered on the altar, part would be eaten by the priests and part would be eaten by those who brought the sacrifice. Since this sacrifice is eaten, Bet Shammai allows one to offer it on Yom Tov.  As we have learned before one is allowed to prepare food on Yom Tov, and this includes offering edible sacrifices. However, Bet Shammai holds that one cannot lay his hands on the sacrifice because leaning on an animal is considered using the animal and this is prohibited on Yom Tov.  Bet Shammai holds that the laying of the hands must be done the day before. Furthermore, Bet Shammai does not allow the sacrifice of burnt-offerings on Yom Tov, because burnt offerings are completely consumed on the altar.  Since they are not eaten they cannot be offered.  One who wants to bring a burnt-offering would have to do so on Hol Hamoed, the intermediate days of the festival.",

Rabbi Akiva says: even [if there is only time to eat] as much as an olive of raw flesh [taken] from the place of slaughter.</b>  Slaughtering on Yom Tov is permitted as long as the person will have time left over in the day to eat some of the animal’s meat. If there is no time to eat any part of the animal then he can’t slaughter it because he would be doing so in order to eat it on another day.  In the case in our mishnah it is clear that the person wants to slaughter the animal on Yom Tov because the animal is getting sick and if it dies he won’t be able to eat it.  Even though it is clear that he is slaughtering it only in order to preserve some of its value, and that eating it is a sort of legal fiction, he still may do so, provided there is time left in the day for him to roast a small piece of meat and eat it.  Roasting is the quickest form of cooking, hence the mishnah mentions roasting.  Note that he does not actually have to roast and eat some of the meat, there just has to be time for him to do so. Rabbi Akiva is even more lenient and allows one to slaughter the animal even if there is only enough time to rip out a small piece of flesh from the animal’s throat (“the place of slaughter) and eat it raw.  Rabbi Akiva mentions taking the meat out from the throat because to do this he wouldn’t even need to skin the animal.  It seems even clearer here that this is not actually going to be done there just needs to be enough time so that it could have been done.",

Doing so would look too much like ordinary weekday work and hence it should be avoided on Yom Tov. Rather he may carry it back home piece by piece, a more modest act that others will notice less.  Note that in this case there are values competing against one another.  Carrying it back piece by piece is more work for him and nevertheless the mishnah recommends doing so to avoid the act looking like weekday work. To put this otherwise, the mishnah preserves the overall communal character of the day as a day free from work at the expense of the individual’s own experience."

This is forbidden even if he weighs the meat out in a manner that is usually permitted, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah.  Merely mentioning the price seems to be forbidden.

Cooking is permitted and therefore we must allow people to get things at the store (remember they had no refrigeration and probably stored very little food at home), but when they do so they should refrain from any action that would send the message that business is being conducted as usual.",

Since this is not the way that business is usually conducted it is permitted on Yom Tov.",

Abba Shaul says: he used to do so even during hol hamoed (the intermediate days of the, on account of clarifying the measures. But the sages say: he used also to do so on an ordinary day for the sake of the draining of the measures.</b>  In order to avoid the problem of measuring out wine or oil when giving it out on Yom Tov, Abba Shaul ben Batnit used to fill his measuring vessels before Yom Tov and then just give them out on Yom Tov. Abba Shaul says that Abba Shaul ben Batnit used to do the same thing on the intermediate days of the festival, hol hamoed.  During these days people were not supposed to be doing work (we will learn this in Tractate Moed Katan) and so they had time to learn how to measure things out.  Because there were so many people who came to him, he didn’t have time to fill up all of the measuring vessels that they should be completely full without any froth.  Therefore he filled them up at night. Good manuscripts of the Mishnah do not contain the words “on account of clarifying the measures.”  Indeed there is another explanation in the Talmud. There it says “on account of not attending the Bet Midrash.”  Abba Shaul ben Batnit filled up his measuring vessels early so that he could spend all of hol hamoed teaching Torah.  Rashi explains that many people would come to see him on hol hamoed because they were free from doing work, and hence he didn’t want to waste any time filling up his measures.  Notice Abba Shaul ben Batnit was a businessman he just made sure that he conducted his business in a manner in which he could still teach and learn Torah. The sages say that Abba Shaul ben Batnit always filled up his measuring vessels ahead of time, even on ordinary weekdays.  He would then pour from his vessels into his customers’ vessels and then wait overnight and fill them up more, depending upon how much the clay vessel had soaked up into its walls.  This was his way of making sure that his customers received the full amount that they paid for.",

However, when carrying them he should not carry them in the same manner that he does during the week (non-Yom Tov). What he should do is carry them with his hands on his shoulder or in front of him, held against his body.

He may use the heap of straw even though he did not specifically designate it and has never used that heap before. This is because heaps of straw are automatically set aside for use and do not require any special and intentional designation that they will be used on Yom Tov. In contrast, wood which is in the backyard is not necessarily designated to be used for something that can be done on Yom Tov and one cannot begin to use from that wood on Yom Tov.  Indeed, the Hebrew word in this mishnah for backyard is muktzeh because in that area one sets aside things that one doesn’t have a specific intention to use (for those of you learning modern Hebrew, muktzeh is most definitely not a word for backyard.)"

We should remember that today creating new fire is exceedingly easy  one just flicks a lighter or strikes a match.  In ancient times starting a new fire would have been difficult.

The word “muktzeh” here refers, according to its accepted interpretation, to a place where a person has set his fruit to dry out (dates, figs and grapes).  In order for these fruits to be available for use on Yom Tov, in other words in order for the things in the “muktzeh” to not be “muktzeh”, one must designate them for use before Yom Tov.  Furthermore, this can only happen on the Sabbatical year during which one doesn’t have to separate tithes.  During the other years because the fruit in the muktzeh has not generally been tithed, and it is forbidden to tithe on Yom Tov, one cannot eat them on Yom Tov even if he had designated them for use. He could only eat them if they had already been tithed. The mishnah now brings a debate concerning how one designates drying fruit for use.  According to Rabbi Eliezer all one needs to do is say “From here I will eat.”  The rabbis are stricter and rule that he must point specifically to the area of fruit from which he will eat.

These have some aspect of mitzvah in them but can be done on other days.

And one may not swim in water. And one may not clap hands, nor slap [thighs], nor dance.</b>  Climbing a tree is forbidden lest one breaks a branch, which is forbidden to do on Shabbat.   Riding an animal is considered prohibited lest one while riding break a branch to use as a switch in guiding an animal.  It seems that a deeper reason for why the rabbis prohibited this was that they did not believe that riding an animal was in the spirit of Shabbat.  Swimming was prohibited lest while swimming one makes a raft on which to float. Finally, certain types of clapping, slapping of thighs and dancing were prohibited on Shabbat lest one begin to make music and then come to make a musical instrument.  We should note that some of these activities are no longer generally prohibited because the likelihood that by doing one of them one will come to transgress a more serious commandment is minimal.  In my mind the most important thing to remember is that while one follows the minutiae of Shabbat, one should also be mindful of the spirit of Shabbat.

Judging, betrothing and other legal aspects of arranging various types of marriages can be done any day of the week, therefore one should not do them on Shabbat.

The Shabbat border limit is 2000 cubits to each side of the city. One can set up an eruv, a meal, at the end of the limit and thereby extend it another 2000 cubits in that direction. This extension only works in extending is Shabbat border limit in one direction and causes him to lose a matching amount of distance on the opposite side of the city.  Hence, one who sets up an eruv at the end of 2000 cubits on the western side of the city can now go 4000 cubits in that direction but cannot go outside the city at all on the eastern side.  Our mishnah teaches that these limits apply not only to the person himself but to his animals and his utensils as well.",

So if that brother set his eruv to the west, that vessel can go to the west. However, if all brothers make use of the vessel than it can only go to a place where all of the brothers can go. So if one brother set his eruv to the north and one to the south then the vessel can’t leave the city at all because each brother prevents the other one from bringing the vessel to “his” side."

                    "<b>One who borrows a vessel from his neighbor on the eve of Yom Tov, [it is restricted to the same limits] as the feet of the borrower. [But if he borrowed it] on Yom Tov, it is as the feet of the lender.</b>  If one borrows an object it is considered as if the object belongs to the borrower and therefore it can go on Yom Tov to any place where he/she may go. However, this is only true if he borrowed it the day before Yom Tov, such that when Yom Tov began the object was in his possession.  In other words, the border limits of the object are determined by the one who possessed the object when Yom Tov began.  If he borrowed it on Yom Tov then it can go only where the feet of the lender can go.",
                    "<b>A woman who borrowed from her neighbor spices, water or salt for her dough, these are [restricted to the same limits] as the feet of both them. Rabbi Judah exempts in the case of water, because it is not substantial.</b>  In this case a woman borrows some ingredients from another woman to use them in making dough on Yom Tov. Some of the ingredients therefore belong to the lender and some belong to the borrower.  Since the ownership is mixed (like the dough) the dough can only go to a place where they both can go.  This again means that if one set an eruv to the south and one to the north, the dough cannot leave the city at all. Rabbi Judah says that if all she borrowed was water then the dough is not restricted by the lender since the water is not substantial enough.  Water is not recognized in the final product or its taste and therefore it doesn’t count towards where the dough can go."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe first section of the mishnah teaches that while a live coal is considered as having substance, a flame does not have any substance.\nThe second half of the mishnah deals with the restrictions on the carrying of water drawn from a well.",
                    "<b>A live coal is [restricted to the same limits] as its owner, but a flame can be taken anywhere.</b>  A live coal, one that is burning, is considered to be an object of substance and therefore it is limited to going where its owner can go.  In contrast, a flame has no substance and therefore is not limited in where it can go.  What this means is that a person could take a lamp and light it from somewhat else’s lamp and then not be limited by the other person’s eruv.  The flame that he “takes” from another person has no substance so it is not like borrowing something from another person.",
                    "<b>In respect of a live coal of sanctified property [one who makes use of it] is considered as having trespassed, but as for a flame [of sanctified property], one may not derive benefit from it, but [one who does] has not trespassed.</b>  One who makes non-holy use out of something dedicated to the Temple has “trespassed (me’ilah).”  He must make financial restitution and bring an asham, a guilt offering.  One who makes non-holy use out of a live coal has trespassed because a live coal has substance.  In contrast, one who makes non-holy use out of a flame has not trespassed.  Nevertheless, it is still forbidden to do so. The prohibition is “derabbanan” it is forbidden lest he trespass something with substance.",
                    "<b>If one carries out a live coal into the public domain [on Shabbat] he is liable, but [if he carries out] a flame he is exempt.</b>  Carrying a live coal into the public domain on Shabbat counts as carrying, and hence he has transgressed.  However, carrying a flame does not count as carrying and hence he has not transgressed.  If you ask, how can you carry a flame?  (Ouch!)  The answer is that one could blow a flame from the private domain out into the public domain and that would count as carrying because it moved as a result of his force.",
                    "<b>[The water from]: A private well is [restricted to the same limits] as its owner, And [the water from a well] belonging to the inhabitants of that town is [restricted to the same limits] as the people of that town; And [the water from a well] belonging to those who came up from Babylonia is [restricted to the same limits] as he who draws [the water].</b>  There are three types of wells referred to here. The first is that of a private person. The water in that well can go on Yom Tov wherever he can go. The second is that of a public well. This water belongs to everyone in the city and therefore it can only go where everyone can go.  This means that unless everyone who set up an eruv put it on the same side of the city, the water wouldn’t be able to leave the city. The third type of well is one of the public wells dug for the benefit of the people coming back from Babylonia after the exile.  These wells can be used by any traveler.  They can go anywhere that the person who fills them up can go. The difference between these wells and those shared by the people of a city is that the latter type is jointly owned by the people of the town whereas the former are not owned by anyone."

                    "<b>If one has his produce in another town, and the inhabitants of that city made an eruv in order to bring to him some of his produce, they may not bring it to him.</b>  In the case under discussion here the inhabitants of the other city made an eruv that would allow them to get to the city of the owner of the produce.  Nevertheless, they may not bring him his produce because his produce is limited by where he can go and since he didn’t set up an eruv to get to the other city, it can’t come to him.  Again, a person’s things are limited to going where he may go.",
                    "<b>But if he himself made an eruv, his produce is like himself.</b>  If the owner of the produce set up an eruv then he can go to the other city and bring his produce back with him.  It is irrelevant whether the people of the other city set up an eruv since they are not the owners of the produce."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe first section of the last mishnah of Betzah deals with guests taking food home with them. The last part of the mishnah deals with giving water to animals.",
                    "<b>If one invited guests to his home, they may not take away with them [any] portions unless he [the host] had assigned for them their portions on the eve of Yom Tov.</b>  In mishnaic times the portion of meat that one received at a dinner party was considered very important.  Important guests might receive bigger portions. Sometimes people wouldn’t eat their entire portion and they would be allowed to bring home the leftovers.  After all, with no refrigeration the host wouldn’t be able to do anything with the leftovers in any case. Our mishnah teaches that on Yom Tov guests can’t take their leftovers home with them unless the host gave them ownership over the portions before Yom Tov began. In this way, the portions belong to the guests when Yom Tov begins and they can then go as far as they can go.",
                    "<b>One may not give drink and then slaughter wilderness animals, but one may give drink and slaughter household animals. The following are household animals: they that spend the night in town. Pasture animals are they that spend the night in pasture ground.</b>  Animals that pasture out in the wild are muktzeh they have not been set aside before Yom Tov for use on Yom Tov. Hence one cannot give them water or slaughter them on Yom Tov.  However, one can give water to and slaughter household animals because they are automatically “set aside” to be slaughtered. The mishnah goes on to define what household animals are and what pasture animals are. Congratulations!  We have finished Betzah. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Mishnah Betzah was all about the laws of Yom Tov.  I think at this point it would be worth it to think about how important the Jewish holidays are to the Jewish people.  The matzot and seders of Pesah, sitting in the sukkah on Sukkot, waving the lulav and receiving the Torah on Shavuot these are some of the most important parts of the Jewish year. They remind us of our shared history and hopefully our shared destiny.  Unfortunately I think that the sanctity of Yom Tov has eroded substantially in many of our communities.  I hope that learning this tractate will help inspire you to increase your own personal commitment and to help lead others to increase their commitment as well. And again, as always, congratulations on learning another tractate of Mishnah.  We are getting close to having finished half of the Mishnah.  May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more! Tomorrow we begin Rosh Hashanah."
