                    "<b>Introduction to Kilayim</b><br>The word “kilayim” means mixture, either a mixture of seeds, plants, cross-bred animals or even cross-yoked animals.  The Torah twice prohibits kilayim.",
                    "Leviticus 19:19<br>You shall not let your cattle mate with a different kind (kilayim); you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed (kilayim); you shall not put on cloth from a mixture of two kinds of material (kilayim shatnez).",
                    "Deuteronomy 22:9-11<br>You shall not sow your vineyard with a second kind of seed (kilayim), else the crop – from the seed you have sown – and the yield of the vineyard may not be used.  You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.  You shall not wear cloth combining wool and linen (shatnez).",
                    "The rabbis interpreted “You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed” to mean that planting two different kinds of seed in a field was forbidden and that grafting one type of plant onto another was also forbidden.  “You shall not sow your vineyard with a second kind of seed” meant that one could not plant either grains or vegetables in a vineyard.  ",
                    "Planting two different kinds of seeds in one field is only prohibited if the seeds are mixed up together.  If they are planted separately and there is a divider, one can plant two different kinds of seed in one field.",
                    "In total there are four types of kilayim:  1)  kilayim of the vineyard; 2)  kilayim of mixed seeds in a field—this prohibition includes a prohibition of grafting together different trees; 3) cross-breeding animals; 4) yoking two different types of animals together.  Our tractate will discuss all four different types.  ",
                    "Good luck learning Tractate Kilayim!  ",
                    "<b>Wheat and zunin do not constitute kilayim one with the other.<br>Barley and oats, spelt and rye, or beans and sapir (a type of, or purkdan and tofah (two similar types of, or white beans and kidney beans, do not constitute kilayim one with the other.</b><br>Our mishnah teaches that if two types of seeds, either grains or beans, are very similar to one another then they are not “kilayim” and one can plant a field with both of them mixed.  Kilayim is prohibited only in cases of two distinct species of seed; if the two are almost interchangeable, then there is no prohibition.  The mishnah therefore lists pairs of seeds that are not kilayim with each other.  Since the mishnah’s meaning is quite simple, I have refrained from commenting below.<br>One problem in interpreting and translating this mishnah is that it is difficult to identify many of the species mentioned.  Albeck provides various Latin terms, and all commentators attempt to identify the species, but some of their meanings have probably been lost.  To avoid this problem, I have transliterated some of the terms rather than translate them. Thus “zunin” instead of “Cephalaria Syriaca” or “sapir” instead of “Vicia Narbonensis.”  I realize that this may disappoint the hard-core botanists among you, but I can’t write these Latin terms and pretend I know what they are.  The most important thing to know is that in each pair, the two species are very similar. So while I might not know what “zunin” is, I know it is similar to wheat."

While this admittedly may not be the most exciting topic of study, we should recognize how important these laws would have been to the farmers observing them.  A farmer simply had to know what could and what could not be grown together. Growing the wrong things together may have made his produce forbidden to eat, causing him great financial loss. We should also note that by allowing similar seeds to grow together, the laws were much easier than the might have otherwise have been interpreted.<br>Again, there is not much to explain on this mishnah so I have refrained from commenting."

Note that this section does not deal with planting, because there is no prohibition of planting different trees in juxtaposition. The only prohibition is grafting.<br>The first section of the mishnah continues to list trees that are not kilayim one with the other. That is, they are nearly the same species.  In the second section, the mishnah begins to list trees that are indeed kilayim with one another. Although they look similar and are in some ways similar, they are distinct enough that one cannot graft them together."

In the earlier mishnayot (1-3) the mishnah listed vegetables that were similar enough not to be kilayim one with the other, and therefore permitted to plant together.  In today’s mishnah we learn of vegetables that are similar but not similar enough and therefore are kilayim one with the other.<br>Note that the first five mishnayot form a chiastic structure, meaning an x-like literary structure (usually a-b-b-a, or perhaps a-b-c-b-a). We began with vegetables that are not kilayim (A1), continued with trees that are not kilayim (B1), then trees that are kilayim (B2) and finally vegetables that are kilayim (A2).

This time the mishnah deals with animals, which means that they may not be cross-bred, nor may they be yoked together or put together to perform any labor.  The mishnah will discuss these prohibitions in greater depth in chapter 8:1-2.<br>I realize that some of these species cannot successfully cross-breed, and some are not domesticated and therefore don’t perform work.  It seems that the rabbis were theoretically interested in categorizing animals, even if there was no likely halakhic ramification.  This may be as close as the mishnah gets to a “zoological” work, such as may have been written by ancient scientists like Aristotle."

The prohibition of grafting is also a prohibition of mixing different kinds of trees or vegetables two different kinds are prohibited.  Assumedly, the mishnah relies on the lists already found above trees and vegetables that can be grown together, can also be grafted.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah permits it from a vegetable to a tree.</b>  Rabbi Judah allows one to graft from a vegetable onto a tree (I don’t really know if this works). According to the Tosefta, he also allows from a tree onto a vegetable.  The commentators explain that when a vegetable and tree are grafted together, a new species is not formed, even though they the plant grafted onto the mother plant benefits. According to Rabbi Judah, the Torah prohibits the formation of a new species, but does not prohibit grafting when new species will not be formed. The rabbis are stricter and rule that any grafting of different species is prohibited."

These examples demonstrate cases in which a person might have “grafted” a vegetable onto a tree, a tree onto a vegetable or one vegetable onto another.\nI should note that “vegetable” in rabbinic literature means anything that is not a tree, grain or bean. Thus herbs are “vegetables.”",
                    "<b>They may not plant vegetables in a trunk of a sycamore tree.</b>  It seems that people may have planted vegetables in the trunks of sycamore trees that had been cut down. Assumedly, the vegetables would be able to derive nutrients from the decomposing wood. Alas, while this might be a good idea, it is prohibited because of kilayim.",

It seems that planting the young fig in the sea squill would help cool it by providing shade.  However, this is kilayim and is therefore prohibited.",
                    "<b>They may not insert a vine branch into a melon, in order that the latter might shoot its moisture to the former, since that is [grafting] a tree on a vegetable.</b>  A vine is considered a tree and a melon is a vegetable.  Hence it is forbidden to stick the vine into the melon to use it as a source of moisture.",

Our mishnah teaches that although the intent here is not to actually graft one plant on another but just to preserve them, it is still forbidden due to kilayim, in this case one vegetable with another."

This was an ancient form of refrigeration.  The mishnah rules that as long as some of their leaves are still exposed, we don’t consider the turnips or radishes to have been planted. Thus the person who buried them does not have to worry about having transgressed the laws of kilayim, or the prohibition of planting on the sabbatical year.  If the plant grew more in the ground then he doesn’t have to tithe for the extra growth.  On Shabbat he can take them out of the ground, and this is not considered “harvesting” because they weren’t really attached to the ground.",

If the other species is at least 1/24 of the main species, it is forbidden to plant this mixture.  However, if there is less than 1/24 of the other seed, it is permitted to plant the mixture and this is not kilayim.

Since the mixture was originally prohibited, it is not sufficient to just adjust the proportion.  However, Rabbi Yose agrees that if the mixture was originally less than 1/24 he can plant it without concern for kilayim.",

If two species are kilayim with each other, such as barley and lentils, then when they are mixed in with a dominant seed such as wheat, the barley and lentils add up and if they are together more than 1/24 of the total amount, the mixture must either be reduced or the minority seeds removed.  However, if the species are not kilayim with each other, such as barley and oats they do not add up, because oats is not kilayim with barley (see mishnah one)."

To [an mixture of] grain [occurring] with [different] grain, or pulse with [different] pulse, to grain with pulse, and to pulse with grain.</b>  The rule in yesterday’s mishnah only applies to a case where grains and pulse (beans) became mixed up.

The mishnah refers here to inedible seeds such as garlic seeds or turnip seeds.  If there is in a mixture 1/24 of these seeds in the amount of seeds of grain needed to plant a bet seah (a plot of land that can grow a seah of produce, about 2500 square cubits), but in this size field the seeds would produce much less than a seah, such as a kav, then 1/24 of a kav of these seeds would prohibit a mixture of another seah of other produce (remember grain prohibits if there is 1/6 of a kav).  In other words, since these seeds, if they were grain seeds, would produce a much smaller amount of product if they were planted in a field that could grow a seah of produce, they prohibit mixtures at 1/24 of the level of the amount of product that they would produce, in this case 1/24 of a kav.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Shimon says:  just as they ruled to be stringent so too they ruled to be lenient flax [mixed in with] produce, combines when there is 1/24 of the quantity [of such seed] that is necessary to sow a bet seah.</b>  In the previous section we saw a stringency with regard to garden seeds that are not eaten. Since these seeds produce much less product, the laws are more stringent in their prohibiting a mixture with other produce, such as grain. In contrast, when an equal amount of flax seed is planted in a plot of land used to produce a seah of grain, it will produce three seahs of flax (three times the amount of grain). Therefore, the law is more lenient with them and there will need to be ¾ of a kav of flax seeds mixed in with other seeds before they become prohibited. As a general rule we could summarize that if an amount of seed produces less final product, it will be more potent in prohibiting mixtures, but if it produces more final product, it will be less potent in prohibiting mixtures."

Rabbi Yose said: even in the middle of one's field it is permitted to check one’s field with a row of flax.</b>  In this case both his field and his neighbor’s field are of wheat.  He is allowed to sow one row of flax between the two fields. Everyone knows that one row of flax is so negligible that no one would plant in this manner in order to grow flax for use. Rather it is readily apparent that the only reason to plant the flax was to check the fertility of his field, whether in the future his field is appropriate for sowing flax. Since every one knows that his purpose in planting this furrow was not for the produce, it does not look like kilayim. According to Rabbi Shimon it doesn’t make a difference what type of seed the single row consists of in all cases it is recognizable that he is only planting in order to see if his field can grow this type of species.  It seems that according to Rabbi Shimon people don’t plant rows of single species in order to grow the produce, rather just to check the fecundity of the field. Rabbi Yose holds that one may do so even within one’s own field. That is, one can plant one row of flax in the middle of a wheat field (or any other type of field), because it is apparent that the row of flax was put there only in order to check the field, whether it can sustain flax.  Anyone seeing such a set up will understand that this is not kilayim."

For instance, if there was fallow land or plowed land separating two fields, he can plant two different species next to each other. A wall, even if its stones are only loosely piled on top of each other, a path, fences and ditches that are ten handbreadths high or deep and four handbreadths wide, also all serve as separators, preventing a problem of kilayim. The tree which forms a tent over the ground refers to a tree whose branches lie low to the ground. If one species is planted under the branches, he can plant another species outside of the branches, because the branches themselves serve to separate the two species.  Finally, a rock ten handbreadths high and four wide also serves as a separator."

                    "<b>One who wishes to make his field into square plots [each sown] with a different species, he should divide it into twenty-four square plots for a bet seah, a square plot per bet rova, and he may then sow in each whatever species he wants.</b>  A bet seah is fifty cubits by fifty cubits, 2500 square cubits.  If you were to divide this size field into twenty-four plots, each being able to contain a quarter of a rova (a rova is 1/6 of a seah), each plot would be 104 1/6 square cubits, 10.2 x 10.2.  Each of these plots is considered a separate field and therefore he can plant whatever seed he wants in each. Since they are distinct plots and the whole field is set up this way, it is clear to anyone who sees the field that this is not kilayim.",
                    "<b>If there is one square plot or two [inside his field], he may sow them with mustard, but if there are three he may not sow them with mustard, since it looks like a field of mustard, the words of Rabbi Meir.</b>  The mishnah now refers to a case where there are a limited number of plots within a field planted with a single species. Rabbi Meir says that one can plant one or two plots of mustard within the field and this still doesn’t look like kilayim. However, if he plants three plots of mustard this looks like a field of mustard mixed in with a field of grain, and there is a problem of looking like kilayim.  This is a problem specifically with mustard because people don’t typically plant this much mustard within a grain field.  If it was another species, he could plant more plots and they wouldn’t look like a full field of one species intermingled with another.",
                    "<b>But the sages say: nine square plots are permitted, ten are forbidden.</b>  The sages rule more leniently than Rabbi Meir, allowing one to plant up to nine plots of a different species within a field the size of a bet seah.  However, ten square plots looks like a field, and is therefore prohibited. Nine plots can be arranged in the following way so that each plot does not come into contact with each other: Note that according to other opinions, there are other ways to draw this.  In any case, what is most important is that since no two plots of one species are adjacent to each other, it doesn’t look like two different kinds of fields intermingled.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: even though the whole of his field is a bet-kor, he may not make within it more than one square plot.</b>  A bet-kor, which is 75,000 square cubits, is much larger than a bet-seah, which is only 2500 square cubits.  Nevertheless, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says that no more than one plot of a different species may be planted there.  This explanation, while if fits the words, is hard to understand.  Therefore, Albeck explains that Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov looks at the whole field as one square plot, meaning that even in a gigantic field such as a bet-kor, one can sow only one type of seed.  He doesn’t allow any plots of another species."

Yesterday we learned that if a person wishes to sow his field with different species he must leave an empty plot in between the sown plots. The empty plot must be the size of a bet rova (1/24 the size of a bet seah).  In our mishnah we learn that any plot which can’t be used for sowing seed serves as a break between the different species, even if the plot is not completely empty.\nThe second half of our mishnah teaches how far one must separate different species in order that they shouldn’t look like kilayim.",

The first object is the space around a vine that the vine’s roots take up.  Thus if there is a plot planted with a vine, the vine’s roots, which are halakhically considered to take up six handbreadths (we will return to this subject in 3:7), and these six handbreadths count toward the empty bet rova.  So too a grave and a rock all count towards the empty space needed to separate between the different species, even though it is obviously impossible to plant on a grave or on a rock.",

According to the Rambam this must be a square meaning 10 1/5 cubits by 10 1/5 cubits.",
                    "<b>Vegetables within [a field of other] vegetables the measure is six handbreadths.</b>  Vegetables are planted in smaller plots, hence one can plant them closer to each other (imagine the tomato or cucumber garden my Dad has behind his house they’re very good, so if you’re ever in Margate, NJ in the summer..). The distance is only six handbreadths square, far smaller than that for grain.",

Rabbi Eliezer says: vegetables in [a field of] grain the measure is six handbreadths.</b>  The mishnah now deals with cases where a person wants to put grain in a field of vegetables, or vice versa. According to the first opinion, the two species must be kept at a distance of a bet rova, since one is grain.  According to Rabbi Eliezer, he must distance them only six handbreadths, the measure for distancing vegetables."

If the stalks grew or the vegetable plants grew and began to hang over the other species, this does not constitute kilayim, since he distanced them properly. The only except is the Greek gourd, which evidently can significantly tangle itself up with other species that are growing near it.  Since this will really look like kilayim, he must uproot either the gourd or the other species growing near it.",

But I recognize their   words [as more acceptable] than mine.</b>  Rabbi Meir adds two other species that also entangle themselves up with other species growing near them.  However, in the end, Rabbi Meir admits that the rabbis’ limiting this to the Greek gourd is more acceptable than his extending it to the cucumber and Egyptian beans. One might ask: if he tends to agree with the other rabbis, then why does he still make his statement at all? The answer, according to commentators, is that he received his opinion from his teachers, and although he did not actually agree with this opinion, he still stated it in order that it should be preserved for future generations."

The three sages differ with regard to how long this row has to be. Rabbi Ishmael says that the row has to run the whole distance of the field, essentially dividing the field in half.  This turns the row of a different vegetable into its own field, in which case there is no problem of kilayim. Rabbi Akiva says that the row need not go the entire distance of the field.  His condition is that the row must be six handbreadths wide and as wide below as it is above. That is to say the sides of the furrow don’t slant but are rather dug straight down. Rabbi Judah says that the width need only be as wide as a footstep.  In the Talmud this is explained to be one handbreadth.

The main point is that from the Torah kilayim are only prohibited if the two species are actually mixed together.

Each row is four cubits wide, which means he now has an empty space of eight cubits (about four meters).  He then can plant in the middle of this space a row of gourds, leaving two clear cubits on each side to separate them from the onions. He then may keep the next two rows of onions because they are separated from the gourds.  Then he pulls up another two rows of onions and again plants within them one row of gourds. In this way there are twelve cubits between each row of gourds.  This procedure continues as long as he wants.  Rabbi Ishmael holds that since gourds have long leaves, if they are not significantly separated it will look like a field of gourds that has onions (or any other species of vegetable) mixed in.",

There is no need for the gourds to be two cubits away from the onions.  According to Rabbi Akiva, the gourds will end up being only eight cubits apart.",

This is 10.2 cubits by 10.2 cubits, or about 25 square meters (see above 2:10).",

All he must do is separate the row of gourds from the grain by six handbreadths, the amount of space he needs around the gourds in order to take care of them.  If the gourd plants overgrow this six handbreadth limit, he needs to remove the leaves that creep into the separation area.",

The other rabbis respond that this would make the rule with regard to gourds stricter than the rule with regard to vines.  Below in mishnah 4:5 we will learn that when it comes to separating vines from grain, only six handbreadths are required.  Since the rules of kilayim governing vines mixed in with grain are in some ways stricter than those governing mixing of seeds, the rabbis question why Rabbi Yose is stricter with regard to the mixing of seeds. Rabbi Yose answers that there is precedent for his strict ruling.  Single vines may be planted six handbreadths from grain, whereas single gourd plants must be distanced by a bet rova, as we learned above.  In essence, Rabbi Yose holds that there is no difference in the distancing of single plants from full rows if a single plant must be distanced by a bet-rova, then so too must the full row.",

From here we can see that according to Rabbi Meir, gourds must be separated from other vegetables by the distance of 1/3 of a bet seah, and not merely by a bet rova, a far smaller amount. Rabbi Meir attributes this opinion to Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Yose ben Hahotef Ephrati transmits an even stricter opinion in the name of Rabbi Ishmael.  A bet kor is 75,000 square cubits.

Think of an ancient mishnaic square dance, with vineyards instead of haystacks!<br>Sections one and two:  Before the mishnah discusses the law of a karahat or mehol, or even what these things are, it brings a debate between Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel concerning how large they must be in order to be considered a karahat or a mehol.  As usual, Bet Shammai is the stricter opinion, with regard to both the karahat and the mehol.<br>Section three:  As explained in the introduction, a karahat is a patch in the middle of a vineyard in which there is a clearing, meaning there are no vines.<br>Section four:  If this patch is smaller than sixteen cubits (the opinion of Bet Hillel) then it is forbidden to sow seed there.  However, if there are sixteen cubits by sixteen cubits, they can leave space in which to work the vines (four cubits on each side) and plant seeds in the middle.  For instance, if the karahat is 16 by 16, he leaves four cubits on each side and he is left with an 8 x 8 patch 8 in which to plant seed."

To signify that something has become kilayim the mishnah uses the word “sanctify (kidesh),” which is the word used in Deuteronomy 22:9.  Sometimes when things become “sanctified” they can no longer be used it is prohibited to derive benefit from them.  Since a vineyard can consist of only one row, when the Torah states that the “vineyard” becomes sanctified, Bet Shammai interprets this to mean that the minimum area which can be considered a vineyard becomes sanctified.

Therefore, one who sees thorns growing in his vineyard and doesn’t remove them has caused the vineyard to become prohibited.

                    "<b>Introduction</b> In mishnah 4:5 we learned that according to Bet Hillel, there need to be two rows of vines for their to be a vineyard, whereas Bet Shammai held that only one row was necessary.  As a reminder, if something is considered a vineyard, he will have to distance seeds four cubits from there, whereas if it is considered to be individual vines, he will only have to distance the seeds six handbreadths. In today’s mishnah we learn that Bet Hillel agrees with Bet Shammai that an aris, vines draped over reeds or a fence, is treated like a vineyard.  In English this is translated as an “espalier,” a word which I admit that until now I did not know.  My on-line dictionary translates it as, “a plant, especially a fruit tree, trained to grow flat against an upright surface, for example, a wall or fence, or on wires.”",
                    "<b>What is an aris (an espalier) [which is regarded as a vineyard]? One who has planted a [single] row consisting of five vines beside a fence ten handbreadths high, or beside a trench ten handbreadths deep and four wide, they leave a space of four cubits in which to work it.</b>  For an aris to be considered like a vineyard, it must have at least five vines planted next to a fence ten handbreadths high or a trench ten handbreadths deep and four wide. They would train the vine to grow either on the sides of the fence, or on the walls of the trench.  It seems that since this structure is more substantial, Bet Hillel agrees that it is treated like a vineyard.  Practically speaking, treating the vines as a vineyard means that he will have to distance any seeds four cubits from them, as opposed to six handbreadths, the distance for single vines.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: they measure the four cubits from the body of the vine to the field; But Bet Hillel says: from the fence to the field.</b>  The mishanh now records a disagreement as to where they measure from when providing a space to work the vineyard. According to Bet Shammai they measure from the vines themselves.  Bet Hillel says that they measure from the fence on which the vines are trained to the plot that he wants to plant with seeds, even though there will end up being less than four cubits between the actual vines and the seeds.",

Rabbi Yohanan b. Nuri admits that there was a tradition concerning “four cubits” and an “aris,” but he holds that the tradition was not like that recorded above. The “four cubits” and an “aris” tradition teaches that if the aris grew four cubits out from the fence, then they leave a space (of six handbreadths) in which to work the aris, just as they do with a single row of vines, and they may plant between this space and the fence.  However, if there are less than four cubits, then one can’t plant between the vines and the fence.",

According to the first opinion, he needs to leave six handbreadths, whereas Rabbi Akiva holds that three are sufficient."

If one row of vines is planted on an upper terrace and another row is planted on a lower terrace, then the rows combine, provided that the upper row is less than ten handbreadths higher than the lower row.  In such a case the rows will combine to form a vineyard. However, if they are separated by more than ten handbreadths, then they do not combine to form a vineyard and each row is treated separately."

The advantage gained through this technique is that he now gets a new vine that is in a sense “nursed” by its mother vine, at least for the time being.  This is less risky and simpler than starting a new vine from scratch. Using this technique one can also allow more vines in his vineyard.

This rule holds true even if he conducted the vine through a dried-out gourd, which would have been used as a pipe, or a regular pipe made out of clay.

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah deals with a case where a person was forced off of his property by another person, called an anas, a term which I have translated as “forceful occupier.” Evidently, this was a problem in the tannaitic period, and there are a number of halakhot that deal with the phenomenon (see for instance Mishnah Sanhedrin 3:3). In our case, the anas sows seeds in the vineyard and then the rightful owner gets his property back.  As we learned in yesterday’s mishnah, since the vineyard does not belong to the anas, the seeds are not forbidden immediately.  The question that our mishnah asks is: when the property reverts to the original owner what does he have to do to prevent the seeds from becoming forbidden?",
                    "<b>If a forceful occupier ( has sown seed in a vineyard, and it went out of his possession [and reverted to the rightful owner], he (the original should cut it down, even during hol hamoed.</b>  As soon as the land reverts to its rightful owner (a Jew) he must immediately cut down the seeds before they begin to grow.  He must do so even on hol hamoed, when it is normally forbidden to work the field.",
                    "<b>Up to what amount should he pay the workers?  Up to a third.</b>  In order to cut down these seeds as promptly as possible, he must hire workers to do so.  In other words, he can’t just cut them down himself if it will take him too long to do so.  The mishnah asks how much he must pay these workers. There are two opinions as to what “up to a third” means.   The first opinion is that he must pay them up to a third more than the usual wages. Another interpretation is that he must pay them up to a third of the value of the vineyard. Either way, he must spend a considerable sum of money to get rid of the seeds before the whole vineyard becomes prohibited.",
                    "<b>If [they demand] more than this, he should cut it in his usual way even if he has to keep cutting after the festival.</b>  If the workers ask for more money, then he need not pay them such an exorbitant amount. Rather he can just cut the seeds down at his own pace, even if he won’t finish the work until after the festival.",

In other words, in what situation must a person who gets his field back act according to the previous halakhah. The answer is that the field must have been called by the anas’s name, and not by the name of the original owner.  If, however, the seeds were simply planted by someone who had not taken forceful possession of the field, or if the field was not yet recognized as belonging to the anas, then the rightful owner need not cut the seeds down with such haste, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah.  The reason why the law is stricter in the case of the anas is that people think that the field belonged to the anas and if the seeds are not prohibited they will think that the laws of kilayim are not being observed.  In contrast, in other cases they will realize that someone planted seeds in a field that belonged to someone else and that this does not constitute a situation of kilayim."

When the mishnah says that one “receives the forty [lashes]” it is expressing that one has transgressed a biblical commandment.

We should note that even if a dog is domesticated it couldn’t be yoked together with another species. This causes us to ask why the mishnah bothers classifying this and the other animals that appear in the next three sections. According to the Tosefta, the reason for this classification is that if a person sells all of his “behemot” or all of his “hayyot” we need to know which animals he has sold.  It also seems to me that just as zoologists like categorizing animals and botanists like categorizing plants, rabbis liked categorizing as well.<br>Section six: A human being cannot be considered “kilayim” with any animal.

                    "<b>Sellers of clothes may sell [clothes made of kilayim] in accordance with their custom, as long as they do have not the intention in the sun, [to protect themselves] from the sun, or in the rain [to protect themselves] from the rain.</b>  Evidently, while clothes-sellers were traveling, they would sometimes wear the clothes that they intended to sell. They would do this either to transport the clothes from place to place (they were peddlers) or to show people how the clothes looked, or both.  The mishnah rules that the traveling clothes salesman may wear kilayim, as long as his intention in wearing them is not to use them as covering, either in the summer because of the sun or in the winter because of the rain. The discerning reader will note that this mishnah seems to disagree with mishnah two, where we learned that one cannot wear kilayim in order to smuggle them away from the tax collectors. In both cases a person wears a garment not because he wants to wear it as clothing but for some other reason.  While mishnah two prohibited this, our mishnah permits it, as long as he doesn’t intend to also use it as clothing.",

Again, this is prohibited if he intends to use the material as protection from sun or rain.",
                    "<b>The scrupulous sew [such materials as they are laid] on the ground.</b>  Again, similar to yesterday’s mishnah, those who are more religiously scrupulous would not take advantage of such a leniency. Rather, they would lay the materials on the ground while they were waiting to be sewn."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah teaches that there are certain items that are assumed to have mixtures of wool and linen and therefore they need to be checked before they can be worn.",
                    "<b>The Birrus blanket or Brindisian blanket, or Dalmatian cloth, or felt shoes, may not be worn until one has examined them.</b>  Evidently, it was typical that these wool garments or shoes would be sewn using linen thread.  Hence, before one wears one of these types of clothing, he must first check them to make sure they do not consist of kilayim.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Yose says: ones that come from the coast or from lands beyond the sea, do not require examination, since the presumption with regard to them is [that they are sewn] with hemp.</b>  Rabbi Yose says that the above law does not apply to such objects if they come from the coast of Israel or from “the lands beyond the sea” a term which refers to the lands lying to the west of Israel (Greece, Rome etc.).  In those lands, such items are sewn with hemp thread, to which the laws of kilayim do not apply, as we learned above in mishnah one.  The suspicion is only with regard to such items that come from Israel, or from the east of Israel (Syria and Persia) or perhaps from the South (Egypt).",
                    "<b>Felt-lined shoes are not subject to the laws of kilayim.</b>  There are two explanations for this clause. The first is that we are not concerned lest felt-lined shoes have linen mixed in with them.  In other words, only if one knows that they have linen are these shoes prohibited. The second interpretation is that this shoe does have both wool and linen in it, but it doesn’t have a heel.  Since it doesn’t have a heel it is not subject to the laws of kilayim."

The transgressor has perverted God's laws, and by doing thus he causes God to pervert His path from him (meliz, another form of naloz)."

                    "<b>Introduction</b> This mishnah teaches various cases in which the kilayim prohibition applies despite the fact that the wool and linen may not seem to actually be woven together. According to some commentators, some of these prohibitions are only “derabanan,” of rabbinic status and not of toraitic status.",
                    "<b>Felted materials [can be] prohibited because of kilayim, since they are combed.</b>  Felt is made from wool that is beat and not spun.  It is prohibited to attach it to linen even without weaving them together because the wool and linen are combed together.  According to one opinion in the Talmud, this prohibition is only derabanan from the Torah the garment is prohibited only if it is combed, spun and ten woven.  However, the rabbis added that even if only one of these processes has taken place, the garment is prohibited because of kilayim.",
                    "<b>It is prohibited to attach a string of wool (to linen material, since this resembles weaving.</b>  A pif (or piv) is a string that falls from a garment when it is being woven and that the weavers stick into the sides of the garment when giving it to the purchaser.  If the woven material is of linen, one cannot put a pif of wool on it and vice versa. This looks too much as if they had been woven together.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Yose says: it is forbidden to use cords of purple [wool to tie round a loose linen garment], since before he ties it, he stitches it on.</b>  Since this wool belt is stitched to the linen garment and not just tied around the garment, it does violate the laws of kilayim.",
                    "<b>One may not tie a strip of woolen material with one of linen material for the purpose of girdling one’s loins, even if there is a leather strap between the two.</b>  Tying a belt made of woolen material together with one of linen material is prohibited even if a leather strap is sewn between the wool and the linen in order to separate them. The reason that this is still prohibited is that when he will eventually tie the ends of the belt together when he ties it around his waste."

If these strings were of linen and the garment was of wool, or vice versa, then they are prohibited because of kilayim.",
                    "<b>One who sticks one thread [through material], this does not constitute a connection, nor does [the prohibition of] kilayim apply and one who unties [such a connection] on Shabbat is exempt.</b>  The next three sections deal with the question of how many stitches are needed for two garments to be considered sewn together.  If one sticks a needle once into two garments and brings the string out on the other side, the two garments are not yet considered to be sewn together. There are three ramifications to this:  1) if one garment is impure the other has not yet become impure; 2) if one is wool and one is linen they are still not considered kilayim; 3) one who undoes this string on Shabbat is not liable for the prohibited act of “untying” (see Shabbat 7:2).",
                    "<b>If one made its two ends come out on the same side [of the material], this constitutes a connection, and it comes under the prohibition of kilayim, and one who unties such a connection on Shabbat is liable.</b>  In this case one pulled the needle through and then brought it back up again, so that the two heads of the string are sticking out from the same side.  Now the two garments are considered tied together.  If one becomes impure, the other is impure as well.  If one is wool and one is linen then they are prohibited because of kilayim. And if one undoes such a string on Shabbat, he has transgressed the prohibition of “untying.”",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah said: [the prohibition does not apply] until one has made three stitches.</b>  Rabbi Judah says that the two garments are not considered connected until he brings the string across three times.",
                    "<b>A sack and a basket [one having a strip of woolen material attached to it, and the other a strip of linen] combine to form kilayim.</b>  If there is a piece of wool attached to a sack and a piece of linen attached to a large basket and then one attaches the sack to the basket, the wool and linen join to become kilayim. Congratulations!  We have finished Kilayim! It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Kilayim overall was about preserving God’s world as it was created. There are many lessons that we could draw from this fascinating prohibition, but I think that the most important one is that we must have respect for creation and while we can intervene and add our own hand to the act of creation, we must have limits as well. Some of the massive environmental damage that we are only now beginning to be aware of is a result of our not respecting any limits to our own power.  I hope that the through all the myriads of details in this tractate, a larger message is allowed to shine through. Tomorrow we begin Tractate Sheviit."
