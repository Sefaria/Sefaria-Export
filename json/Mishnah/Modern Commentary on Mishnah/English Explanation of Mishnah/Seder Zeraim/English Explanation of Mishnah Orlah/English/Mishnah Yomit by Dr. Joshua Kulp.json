            "Tractate Orlah is concerned with fruit that grows on a tree during its first three years of growth. The laws are all based on Leviticus 19:23-24:",
            "When you enter the land and plant any tree for food, you shall regard its fruit as forbidden (arel). Three years its fruit shall be forbidden (arel) for you, not to be eaten. In the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, (set aside) for jubilation before the Lord; and only in the fifth year may you use its fruit—that its yield to you may be increased. I the Lord am your God.",
            "According to this verse, fruit which grows on a tree during its first three years is prohibited. The rabbis add that it is prohibited not just to eat this fruit, but also to derive any benefit from it. ",
            "The years of a tree are counted not by how long ago the tree was actually planted but by the calendar years. The first of Tishrei is the date that is considered the first of the year for orlah (see Rosh Hashanah 1:1) so a tree planted before the first of Tishrei (actually thirty days before the first of Tishrei so that it has time to grow roots), is considered to already be in its second year. ",
            "In its fourth year the fruit is called “fourth year produce” or “neta revai.” The mishnah dealt with this subject at the end of tractate Maaser Sheni because this fruit is treated similarly to second tithe. ",
            "Our tractate also deals extensively with the subject of orlah fruit that has become mixed up with other permitted produce. It also deals with mixed seeds and terumah that have become mixed up with other produce, because these halakhot are all similar.  "

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nOur mishnah teaches that if a fruit tree is planted for a reason other than to provide fruit, it is exempt from the laws of orlah and its fruit may be eaten within the first three years of growth. This law is a great example of the strong role intent, in Hebrew, kavvanah, plays in rabbinic law. The intent of the person planting the tree is what determines the status of its fruit, and not the mere physicality of whether the tree is three years or older.",
                    "<b>One who plants [a fruit tree] as a fence or to provide wood beams, it is exempt from [the law of] orlah.</b>  As stated in the introduction, if the tree was planted for another reason other than for its fruit, its fruit is permitted immediately, without having to wait three years. This law also stems (no pun intended) from Leviticus 19:23, which begins, “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food...” The tree is subject to the laws of orlah only if it is planted for food.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Yose says: even if he said “The inward [facing part of the tree] is for food, and the outward [facing part] is for a fence,” the inward [facing part] is subject [to orlah], and the outward [facing part] is exempt.</b>  Rabbi Yose says that one can divide a tree into two parts. If the inward part, the part facing the field, was planted for food and the outer part was planted to serve as a fence to his field, he can eat the fruit of the outside part without waiting three years. But the laws of orlah do apply to the inside part."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah deals with situations in which a tree is exempt from the laws of orlah, or situations in which it is subject, even though one might have thought that it should be exempt.",
                    "<b>If at the time when our ancestors came into the land and they found [a tree already] planted it was exempt [from the laws of orlah]. If they planted [a tree], even though they had not yet conquered [the land], it was subject [to orlah].</b>  This law is based on the beginning of Leviticus 19:23, “When you enter the land and plant any tree for food.” The laws of orlah do not apply to trees that were planted before the Israelites entered the land of Israel in the times of Joshua. If they planted a tree, the laws would apply even though the land had not yet been conquered. Obviously this law is not of any practical significance. This is a good example of what interests the rabbis. They are interested in practical matters and there are many halakhot in the Mishnah that have practical significance. But they are no less interested in explaining the Torah, even in cases where there is no practical implication to their words. This section of this mishnah is solely meant to explain the verse.",
                    "<b>If one planted a tree for [the use of] the many, it is subject. But Rabbi Judah makes it exempt.</b>  According to the first opinion, if one plants a tree on his own property for the use of many others, the tree is still subject to the laws of orlah. Rabbi Judah disagrees and says that it is not.",
                    "<b>If one has planted [a tree] in the public domain, or if a non-Jew has planted, or if a robber has planted, or one who plants on a boat, or [a tree] that has grown of itself, it is subject to orlah.</b>  In all of the cases in this mishnah we might have thought the tree is not subject to the laws of orlah, therefore the mishnah teaches that the tree is subject. The first three categories all seem to say that the status of the planter and the status of the tree do not matter. Thus, although a tree in the public domain does not belong to the one who planted it, it is still subject to orlah. Halakhah does not generally apply to non-Jewish produce, but since the status of the tree is not determined by its owner, the tree planted by a non-Jew is subject to orlah. The robber does not own the field in which he planted the tree. Nevertheless, the tree is subject to the laws of orlah.  All three of these categories serve to distinguish orlah from most of the other agricultural laws. For instance, produce which grows in the public domain is exempt from tithes. A tree that is planted on a boat is also liable, because the boat is treated as if it was land. Finally, a tree that has no owner is also liable, because as we have stated, it is the tree that is determinative, not the owner."

                    "<b>If a tree was uprooted and the hard soil together with it, or if a stream swept it away and the hard soil together with it, [then] if it could have lived it is exempt, But if [it could] not, it is subject.</b>  The criterion throughout the mishnah for determining whether the tree is considered to be replanted is whether it could have lived from the amount of soil that was uprooted with it. The test would seem to be placing it in a pot if there was enough soil still stuck to the roots of the tree that the tree could continue to live then it is exempt from the laws of orlah, meaning that this is not considered replanting. But if it could not live from this soil, then the clock is rewound and the fruit of next three years will be prohibited.",
                    "<b>If the hard soil has been detached from its side, or if a ploughshare shook it, or if someone shook it, and one reset it with earth, [then] if it could have lived, it is exempt, But if not, it is subject.</b>  This same rule applies in situations where the tree lost some of its soil and then a person put more soil back there. If the tree could have lived off of the soil that was left attached to it, then putting new soil on it doesn’t count as replanting. But if it could not have lived off of this soil, then it does count as replanting."

Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel said in the name of Rabb Eliezer ben Judah a man of Bartota:  as [thick as] a pin [used for] stretching.</b>  In order for the root to count as still attaching the tree to ground, it must be as thick as a pin that weavers used for stretching the cloth. Others explain that this is a pin used by launderers. In any case, if the root is thinner than that, it would not be sufficient to nourish the tree, so we would have to consider the tree as having been detached and then replanted, which means that for the next three years its fruit will be prohibited."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThere are two agricultural practices mentioned in this mishnah. The first is taking a branch from a vine, bending it down into the ground and then bringing it up again elsewhere. Underground the branch will grow new roots. Our mishnah will ask the question of how to reckon the years of the vine that grows from what it calls a “bent-down and rooted shoot.”\nThe second practice is grafting, whereby one takes a detached branch and grafts into onto an existing vine.",
                    "<b>A tree which was uprooted and it has a bent-down [and rooted] shoot, and it [the tree] derives sustenance from it [the shoot], the old [tree] is [considered] like the shoot.</b>  In this case the original, old tree (or vine) was uprooted, but a branch that had been bent into the ground still remains in the ground and provides sustenance to the tree. The mishnah rules that the tree is considered to be like the shoot. Shoots that are bent into the ground are not subject to the laws of orlah as long as they are still attached to the older vine/tree, because the Torah says, “When you plant” and the rabbis understand this as excluding bending shoots into the ground. Note that the innovation here is that even though the branch that had been bent and rooted into the ground now looks like a new vine, it still counts as far as attaching the old vine to the ground.",
                    "<b>If one bends [and roots] from it year after year, and it became detached, one counts from the time it became detached.</b>  If one bends and roots branches into the ground year after year, and at some point the new vines the grow from these shoots become detached from the mother tree, their count as far as orlah goes begins from the time they become detached. Up until that point their count went according to the old vine but once they are detached we have to look at them as if they were just planted.",
                    "<b>A grafted shoot of vines, and a grafted shoot [growing] on another grafted shoot, even if he rooted them in the soil, they are permitted.</b>  This section deals with grafting vines onto an older tree. If one grafts new vines onto an old tree their orlah count goes according to the older tree. This is true even if he puts grafts onto other grafts, and even if he bends some of those grafts into the ground such that they receive nourishment from the soil. In all of these cases, as long as the new grafts are connected to the old tree, one does not have to start a new count of years for the issue of orlah.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Meir said: in an instance where it is strongly [grafted], it is permitted, but in an instance where it is poorly [grafted], it is prohibited.</b>  Rabbi Meir is referring to a grafted branch which is grafted onto an already existing grafted branch. If the grafted branch onto which the new one is being grafted is strongly attached to the tree, meaning this graft is successful and is producing new fruits, then the new graft is permitted in terms of orlah. The old graft is considered part of the old tree. But if the prior graft is not strongly attached, then the new one is prohibited, because we can’t look at the old graft as if it is attached to the tree.",
                    "<b>A bent-down [and rooted] shoot that has become detached and is full of fruit, [then] if it increased one two hundredth, it is prohibited.</b>  The final section of our mishnah returns to discuss a branch of a vine that is bent down and rooted into the ground. As we learned above, as long as the branch is attached to the old vine, its fruit is permitted.  In this case, the branch grows fruit while attached and then becomes detached. The question is: does the orlah count restart for the fruit that has already grown? The mishnah rules that if the fruit grew 1/200 in size, then the fruit is prohibited. This is the standard number for cases of orlah mixed with non-orlah. If there is 1/200th orlah, then the mixture is prohibited. This would also be the case here the part that grew when the branch was attached is not orlah, whereas the new growth is orlah. So if the new growth is 1/200th or more of the total volume, then it is prohibited."

                    "<b>If a shoot of orlah or a vineyard in which seeds had been planted (, became mixed up with [other] shoots, behold one may not gather [the fruit].</b>  A person has a bunch of plants in his backyard, or a few vineyards. Some of the plants are orlah, or some of the vineyards have seeds of grain planted in them (kilayim). These plants or vineyards are prohibited. However, he doesn’t know which plants are orlah or which vineyards are kilayim (the grain is assumedly gone). If he has not yet gathered the fruit, he cannot gather any of the fruit from any of these plants. While some times prohibited things can become nullified if they are small enough percentages of a mixture, this is the case only if the produce is already detached from the ground. Since this produce is still attached to the ground, he cannot even pick it.",

Rabbi Yose says: even if he acted deliberately, it becomes neutralized in two hundred-and-one.</b>  If he gathered it already without realizing that some of the produce was prohibited, then as long as there is not more than 1/200 part orlah or kilayim, the prohibited stuff is nullified. However, if he deliberately picked the produce, knowing that this would allow it to be nullified, he is penalized and it is prohibited. The rule is that one is not allowed to intentionally nullify a prohibited substance. Rabbi Yose says that this is not really a case of intentionally nullifying a prohibited substance. When he picks the produce he is not yet nullifying the prohibited plants, because the stuff still attached to the ground can’t be nullified. It is only nullified when the produce is picked and it turns out that less than 1/200 of it is prohibited. Therefore, he can deliberately pick the produce so that the prohibited plants will be nullified."

So if one wants to derive benefit from these parts during the first four years of the tree’s existence, he may do so. When it comes to the vine, these parts are permitted to a nazirite, since he is prohibited from consuming only the grapes and the parts of the grapes (see Numbers 6:3-4). However, when it comes to an Asherah tree, which is a tree used in idolatry, then every part of the tree is prohibited.

Rabbi Eliezer says that the laws of orlah apply to this substance and therefore if one uses it to curdle milk, the cheese will be prohibited. Rabbi Joshua disagrees based on a received oral tradition that the laws of orlah do not apply to the resin that comes from the tree and is used to curdle the milk. This is true as long as the resin comes from the leaves or roots, parts of the tree to which the laws of orlah never apply. However, if he uses the resin that comes from the unripe berries, the cheese is prohibited because these unripe berries are, according to Rabbi Yose, subject to the laws of orlah.

The bundle of fenugreek must be burned.",

According to Rabbi Meir, the fenugreek is considered an “important item” and therefore, no matter what the ratio of permitted fenugreek to prohibited fenugreek, they are all prohibited and they all must be burned.",

                    "<b>For Rabbi Meir used to say: anything that is normally [sold] by counting causes [a mixture] to become consecrated [in even the smallest amount].</b>  According to Rabbi Meir anything that is sold by being counted out at the marketplace (as opposed to being sold by weight or volume) is an important item and therefore it prohibits a mixture no matter how little of the prohibited item is in the mixture. This would explain why bundles of orlah fenugreek cause a mixture to be prohibited no matter how small the ratio of prohibited fenugreek to permitted fenugreek. The word “consecrated” in this mishnah is used synonymously with “prohibit” because oftentimes things that are “consecrated” become prohibited from use. This was the same verb used in mishnah three.",
                    "<b>But the sages say only six things consecrate [a mixture in even the smallest amount], and Rabbi Akiba says seven [things].</b>  The sages agree that some items cause mixtures to be prohibited in even the smallest ratios. However, they limit this to only six items, to which Rabbi Akiva adds a seventh. These items seem to have been more valuable than general items that are sold by count, such as bundles of fenugreek. Since these items are of great significance, the laws are stricter with regard to them.",
                    "<b>And these are they: Nuts with soft shells; badan pomegranates; stopped-up casks; beet shoots; cabbage-heads; Greek pumpkins.</b>  This is a list of the six items. The stopped up casks contain orlah wine.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Akiba says: also loaves [baked by] a householder.</b>  Rabbi Akiva adds in bread baked by a householder which is more valuable than bread baked by a professional baker.",
                    "<b>To those to which orlah applies [they prohibit the mixture] as orlah, [to those of which] kilayim of the vineyard apply [they prohibit the mixture as] kilayim of the vineyard.</b>  Orlah applies to only some of the above items, namely pomegranates, nuts, and wine. So if the mixture contains even the smallest amount of one of these items and it is orlah, the whole mixture is prohibited. Kilayim in the vineyard applies to the other items in the list, so if one of them is kilayim and it becomes mixed in with other permitted items it prohibits the mixture even if it is only a very small amount."

Here we learn that this is true only if they are whole. This is because they are “important items” only when they are whole. If they are in some way broken up, then they lose their importance and they will be neutralized in a mixture of 200 and one, as is the usual rule when it comes to orlah and kilayim."

                    "<b>Doubtful orlah: in the land of Israel is prohibited, in Syria is permitted, and outside the land one may go down and purchase [from a non-Israelite] as long as he has not seen him gathering it.</b>  If one has some produce and doesn’t know whether it is orlah or not, inside the land of Israel, where the prohibition of orlah is from the Torah (deoraita) the produce is prohibited. In Syria, where some of the agricultural laws apply and some don’t (see Demai 6:11; Sheviit 6:2) the produce is permitted. Outside the land of Israel, meaning outside Syria, the law is even more lenient. One may go into the field of a non-Jew and purchase from him produce that may be orlah, as long as the Jew does not see the non-Jew actually pluck the orlah fruit from the orlah tree. In such a case this would not be “doubtful orlah” but rather “certain orlah” which is prohibited derabanan even outside the land of Israel.",
                    "<b>A vineyard planted with vegetables [which are kilayim], and they [the vegetables] are sold outside of it: in the land of Israel these are prohibited, and in Syria they are permitted; outside the land one may go down and purchase them as long as he does not gather [them] with [one’s own] hand.</b>  The rules for kilayim are similar. The vegetables that are described here were possibly grown in a vineyard, because we know that the non-Jew has grown vegetables in his vineyard. However, they are not certain kilayim because they are being sold outside of the vineyard. Inside the land of Israel they are prohibited, because the prohibition of kilayim within Israel is deoraita and therefore we are strict even with doubtful kilayim. In Syria these vegetables are permitted. Outside of Israel one can go down to a vineyard and even see the non-Jew harvest these vegetables as long as he doesn’t gather them with his own hands. This law is even more lenient than the law concerning doubtful orlah, for here one can even see the non-Jew harvest the kilayim. Perhaps the reason that the law is more lenient is that the prohibition of kilayim outside of Israel is only an “enactment of the scribes” as we shall learn in section five.",
                    "<b>New [produce] is prohibited by the Torah in all places.</b>  The end of this mishnah gives three different levels concerning the status of various prohibitions outside of the land of Israel. It is prohibited to eat new produce until the Omer (barley harvest) has begun to be offered on the second day of Pesah (see Hallah 1:1). This prohibition is “deoraita” even outside the land of Israel. This is indeed explicitly stated in Leviticus 23:13.",
                    "<b>And orlah is a halachah.</b>  The prohibition of orlah is a “halakhah”. There are two opinions in the Talmud as to what this means. Some interpret it to mean “the halakhah/law of the land.” This would give it the status of a custom. Others interpret it to mean a “halakhah to Moses at Sinai.” This would give it the status of ancient oral law.",
                    "<b>And kilayim are an enactment of the scribes.</b>  Finally, kilayim are prohibited outside the land of Israel by an enactment of the sages. This refers only to mixed seeds in the vineyard, from which it is even prohibited to derive benefit in the land of Israel. The law regarding different types of seeds that were planted together is more lenient in the land of Israel (one can eat such seeds, just not plant them) and therefore the law outside of Israel is more lenient as well. Yoking together two different types of animals (such as a donkey and an ox) and cross-breeding animals and trees is prohibited by the Torah in all places. For more information concerning kilayim look at my introduction to tractate Kilayim. Congratulations! It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learn the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearn it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. One of the aspects of Orlah that I found interesting was the chapter on forbidden mixtures. Many of our laws of kashrut stem from sources in this chapter and other places in Zeraim. Interestingly, there is far more information in tannaitic sources concerning prohibited agricultural produce such as orlah, kilayim and terumah then there is about prohibited animals and the prohibition of the mixture of milk and meat. When later rabbis (in the Talmudic and post-Talmudic periods) came to codify when something is not kosher (meaning it is either a mixture of milk and meat or stems from a prohibited animal) they often were forced to rely on sources that are from Seder Zeraim, and many from tractate Orlah. Thus this tractate is actually quite practical. Tomorrow we begin Tractate Bikkurim, the last tractate in Seder Zeraim."
