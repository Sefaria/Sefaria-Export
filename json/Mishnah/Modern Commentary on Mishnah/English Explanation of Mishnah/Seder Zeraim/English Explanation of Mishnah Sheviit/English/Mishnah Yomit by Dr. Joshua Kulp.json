                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nAs with many mishnayot, our mishnah begins with the first chronological point of the sabbatical laws, the sixth year which proceeds the sabbatical year.  According to the rabbis, some of the sabbatical year prohibitions begin in the sixth year. This concept is called “tosefet sheviit” the additional time of sheviit.\nThere is somewhat of a debate in talmudic literature over whether this additional time is from the Torah or is a long-standing tradition.\nOur mishnah discusses “tosefet sheviit” for an orchard.",
                    "<b>Until when may they plow an orchard in the sixth year? Bet Shammai say: as long as such work will benefit the fruit. And Bet Hillel says: till Atzeret (.</b>  According to Bet Shammai, as long as the plowing that one does to an orchard is beneficial for that years’ fruit, then it is allowed. Once the plowing starts to be in preparation for the seventh year, it is already prohibited. Instead of giving a time that is somewhat subjective, Bet Hillel gives a set date Shavuot.  Until Shavuot it is permitted to plow, and after Shavuot it is forbidden.",
                    "<b>The views of this [school] are close to those of the other.</b>  The anonymous voice in the Mishnah notes that the dates of the two schools are not that far apart from one another. This might cause us to ask why they disagree. There are a few answers that I could think of.  The first is that although there is only a small amount of time difference, it is still significant. This is not a particularly satisfactory answer because then we would have to ask why the mishnah says that the two are indeed so close to one another. A different answer is that Bet Hillel wants an objective, hard and fast date, whereas Bet Shammai is more willing to live with a more subjective criterion. The answer that I prefer is that Bet Shammai prefers to attach the prohibition to nature, or physical reality. At a certain point plowing stops being for this year’s fruit and then it becomes prohibited. Bet Hillel on the other hand wants to tie the prohibition into a legally determined date, a date set by a court and not by nature."

Today we learn how many trees in a field are necessary for it to be considered an orchard. If it is not considered an orchard, then they will have to stop plowing the field at an earlier point in the year.",
                    "<b>What constitutes an orchard? Any field in which there are at least three trees for every bet seah.</b>  A bet seah is 2500 square cubits. If there are three trees in a field this size, then the bet seah can be treated as an orchard.",
                    "<b>If each tree is capable of yielding a cake of pressed figs, the size of sixty in the Italian maneh, then the entire bet seah may be plowed for their sake.</b>  The three trees that constitute this orchard must each be able to produce a cake of pressed figs the size of sixty Italian manehs.  According to commentators, this is about 24kg. If these two criteria are filled, than they may plow the entire bet seah until Shavuot, since the plowing of the entire field benefits all the trees.",
                    "<b>If less than this amount, they may only plow the area that is occupied by the gatherer when his basket is placed behind him.</b>  However, if there are fewer trees or they produce less fruit, then they may plow only around those trees. The space they may plow is the size of a fruit-gatherer and his basket, as he walks around the tree.  The rest of the field has more stringent rules, those which apply to a grain field, which may only be plowed until Pesah, as we shall see in chapter two below."

If less than this amount, they may plow them only for their own needs.</b><br>In yesterday’s mishnah we learned that in order for the field to be considered an orchard, it needs to have three trees that bear a certain amount of fruit.  Our mishnah adds that if there are non-fruit-bearing trees in the field, we look at them as if they were fig trees. In other words, if these trees are large enough such that if they were fig trees each tree would have been able to produce a cake of pressed figs the size of sixty maneh, then they count and the whole field may be plowed.  If they are smaller, then the whole field may not be plowed; only the space surrounding that tree may be plowed. The remainder of the mishnah is just a repeat of yesterday’s mishnah."

                    "<b>Introduction</b> The first half of this mishnah continues to deal with the same subject with which we have been dealing with since the beginning of Sheviit--when may one plow an entire field of trees and when one may plow only the individual trees? The second half of the mishnah deals with Exodus 34:21, which states, that plowing and harvesting are forbidden on the Sabbath. The sages wondered why the verse would specify a prohibition of plowing and harvesting on the Sabbath when all work is prohibited. Hence they took the verse out of context and applied it to the Sabbatical year, instead of Shabbat (the sabbatical day).",
                    "<b>If one of the trees was capable of bearing a cake of dried figs [weighing sixty manehs], and the other two unable; or, if two could do so, but one cannot, then they may plow them only for their own needs.</b>  If one or even two of the trees was large enough but the others were not, they still may only plow the individual trees and not the whole field.",
                    "<b>[This is the rule if the number of trees is] from three to nine, but if there were ten trees or more, whether they produce [the requisite amount of fruit or not] the whole bet seah may be plowed on their account.</b>  However, if there were more than ten trees, then they can plow the entire field, even if those ten trees don’t produce the requisite amount of fruit.",
                    "<b>As it says: “In plowing and in harvesting, you shall rest” (Ex 34:21). It was unnecessary to state plowing and harvesting in the seventh year, rather [what it means is] the plowing of the year preceding which encroaches on the sabbatical year, and the harvest of the seventh year which extends into the year after.</b>  This midrash is the basis of the entire first three and a half mishnayot of the tractate.  According to the rabbinic way of reading the Torah, this verse is seemingly superfluous, since we already know that one must rest on the Sabbath. Their answer is twofold. First of all, this verse applies to the sabbatical year, and not to the Shabbat. Second, it would also be unnecessary for this verse to prohibit plowing and harvesting in the sabbatical year itself because Leviticus 25:4-5 has already prohibited similar activities.  Therefore, the mishnah interprets this verse as referring to the plowing that precedes the Sabbatical year and to harvesting that occurs after the Sabbatical year. As we have learned throughout the chapter, it is forbidden to plow a field for the benefit of produce that will grow in the sabbatical year.  Here we learn that in the year following the Sabbatical year it is forbidden to harvest produce which mostly grew during the Sabbatical year, or that was illegally sown during the Sabbatical year.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Ishmael says:   just as plowing is an optional act, so harvesting [referred to in the verse] is optional, thus excluding the harvesting of the omer [which is obligatory].</b>  R. Yishmael gives an entirely different interpretation of the verse.  He interprets the verse to refer to the Shabbat and not to the Sabbatical year.  As to why this verse is necessary, after we have learned elsewhere that work is prohibited on Shabbat, Rabbi Ishmael explains that this verse comes to teach us that only “optional” harvesting is prohibited and not “obligatory” harvesting, the only example of which is the harvesting of the Omer on the second day of Pesah. If the second day of Pesah should fall on Shabbat, which it can according to the rabbinic calendar (but not according to the Sadducean calendar, where it always falls on Sat. night) then the harvesting of the Omer (the first barley) supersedes the Shabbat prohibition. Just as plowing is optional and therefore prohibited, so too the only type of harvesting that is prohibited is that which is optional."

In other words, what is critical is that there are three trees, even if they are not owned by the same person.",

Rabban Gamaliel says: sufficient for the driver of the herd to pass through with his implements.</b>  Trees must be properly spaced.  If they grow too close to one another, then in order to care for them, the owner will have to thin them out. Therefore, if the trees in this orchard are too close together, they won’t count, because at least one of three trees is doomed to be cut down. Rabban Gamaliel says that the space left in between the trees must be sufficient for a person riding on animal to pass in-between while he is holding his tools. Any space less than this and one of the trees doesn’t count towards the necessary three trees needed to plow the entire field."

When it comes to saplings, if there are ten saplings in the field they may plow the entire field all the way up to Rosh Hashanah, without any “tosefet sheviit” extension of the sabbatical year.",

Alternatively, if the saplings are surrounded by a fence, one that does not surround the entire field but just those saplings, then they are treated as individual trees and the remainder of the field may not be plowed. The reason is that since they are concentrated in one area, if someone plows the whole field, it will look like he is getting the field ready to be planted on the sabbatical year."

Secondly, there must be more saplings then gourd plants, for instance six saplings and four gourds.",

It doesn’t become permitted for common use until the fifth year. At that point the sapling becomes a tree, according to this opinion. Congratulations tree! We’re very proud of you.",

Until the moisture has dried up in the soil, or as long as men still plow in order to plant cucumbers and gourds.</b>  According to the first opinion, one may plow a grain field in the sixth year up until the later of one of two points. Either until the moisture of the ground that the rain produced has been dried up. This would be some time usually after Pesah, when it stops raining in Israel.  Alternatively, as long as people are still plowing in order to plant cucumbers or gourds, two plants which require a lot of water.  After this point, the plowing is assumed to be for the sabbatical year and it is prohibited.",

Rather in the case of a white field until Pesah, and in the case of an orchard until Atzeret (.</b>  Rabbi Shimon voices an interesting complaint about the previous opinion.  Rabbi Shimon seems to believe that halakhah should not be dependent upon the practices of the individual, which could vary greatly from place to place.  Rather they should be dependent on an absolute date, one common to all.  They therefore say that the grain field may be plowed only until Pesah and like Bet Hillel in mishnah one above, the orchard may be plowed only until Shavuot. I should note that this seems to be somewhat of a general trend in many areas of halakhah. What were once dependent on variant practices, ages, customs etc., later become standardized so that the halakhah is observed uniformly in all places. As far as why there is a difference between the two fields and why plowing the grain field ends earlier than the plowing of the orchard, the Yerushalmi explains that the grain field needs a lot more irrigation. Since it won’t rain much after Pesah, plowing won’t really help that year’s crop after Pesah.   The orchard requires less water and the plowing is only to help convey what little water there is to the tree. Therefore, the deadline for plowing is a little later."

The standards are different for each type of produce. Thus grain and olives that have grown to 1/3 of their eventual size before Rosh Hashanah are tithed with the previous year.  Vegetables belong to the year in which they are harvested. Our mishnah discusses some species that do not fit neatly into either the grain or vegetable category.\nWe should note that it is important to know what year produce is in with regard to tithes because the laws change from year to year.  In the first, second, fourth and fifth years second tithe is separated, whereas in the third and sixth year, poor person’s tithe is separated.  In the seventh year no tithes are separated.

The laws of the Shmitah have presented perhaps the greatest halakhic challenge to rabbis wishing to preserve a halakhic framework within a modern economy complete with a modern agriculture.  It is clear that Israeli farmers could not simply allow their fields to lie fallow for a year and expect to make a living in that year or in the following years.  One of the solutions to this problem is called “heter mekhirah” permission to sell. Just as Jews sell their chametz on Pesah and buy it back after Pesah, so too many farmers sell their fields to Gentiles during Pesah and then buy them back afterwards.  The Gentiles grow the produce and then sell it in the markets here to Jews. While some would scorn such a solution as looking for a way around the halakhah or even as “cheating,” I think that such solutions allow Jews to preserve halakhah and yet be a part of the world.\nI would add, however, that while legal solutions allow one to solve grave financial problems that would be caused were the halakhah to be observed in its original formula, we should not forget the spirit behind the halakhah. Just as the spirit behind selling chametz is to cleanse oneself of the leaven and all that it symbolizes, so too the spirit behind the Shmitah observance is to give the land, which ultimately belongs to God, a chance to rest as well.",

The opposite is an am haaretz, a person who is suspected of not observing these laws. However, most amei haaretz do indeed tithe there food.

At this point, when the am haaretz’s wife touches the produce, specifically the dough which now has water in it, she will make it impure. The problem with causing the dough to become impure is that it has “hallah” in it hallah is the portion of the dough that must be removed and given to the priests. If it is impure the priest will not be able to use it and it will have to be burned. The wife of the “haver” cannot aid in destroying this hallah, and therefore, once water has been placed in the dough, she may no longer touch it.",

It is interesting to note that there is a limit to leniencies given because of “darkei shalom.” One may lend instruments to those who might not use them appropriately, but not if it is certain that they will use them inappropriately. For instance, I could lend my car to someone who might use it during the week and might use it on Shabbat, but it would seem that I could not lend the car to someone who will certainly use it on Shabbat.

So “the river” and Amonah are actually the same place. The produce grown in this area may be eaten and it does not have the sanctity of sheviit produce. However, the land may not be cultivated.

During the sabbatical year a farmer may not keep the produce that he grows in his field for himself. He is obligated to make it ownerless, such that anyone can come and take it. If he doesn’t make it ownerless then it is prohibited to work the field, as it is said in Leviticus 25:5, “You shall not reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your untrimmed vines.” Our mishnah, according to most commentators, refers to a person who has not made his field ownerless, and therefore, may not work the field.",

Any work done with produce that has already been detached from the ground may be performed. The mishnah explains that this refers to threshing or winnowing grain, treading on grapes or making sheaves. However, they may not harvest anything. Since Syria is not actually the land of Israel, harvesting is not prohibited biblically, and is only prohibited by decree of the rabbis. The Yerushalmi explains that the rabbis carved out a middle status for Syria. They did not allow one to harvest there, so that Jews wouldn’t abandon the land of Israel and go live in Syria. However, when it came to working with produce detached from the land, the rabbis were not so strict, thereby enabling people who couldn’t earn a living in Israel, to go to Syria for the year and earn some money there.",

For instance in Eretz Yisrael one cannot harvest grapes in a normal manner, but one can do so in an abnormal manner. Therefore, in Syria one can harvest even in a normal manner. Other commentators explain that Rabbi Akiva is formulating a general principle to explain the previous section.

First of all, the species of plant must be either food for humans, domesticated animals (beasts) or used in the dyeing process.

Sheviit does not fully apply to something that is either not used for any of these three purposes or can be left in the ground without rotting. In tomorrow’s mishnah we will learn more about the rules for produce to which the laws of sheviit do not apply. The main consequence to something being considered sabbatical year produce is that it must be destroyed once the same species cannot be found in the field. Up until this point one could store the species in one’s house, but once this point has passed one must take that type of produce out of the house and get rid of it. Another consequence of something having the laws of sheviit apply to it is that one can use it only for eating, drinking or anointing. We will learn more about this in the next chapter. The laws of sheviit will apply to the money that is derived from the sale of sheviit produce. Thus if one sells some sheviit wheat, the money is treated as if it was the wheat.

In the Talmud two sages argue whether Rabbi Eliezer was actually more stringent or less stringent. What I think is more interesting is that Rabbi Akiva for some reason feared revealing Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion. Rabbi Eliezer is often a figure whom the other rabbis wanted to push away from being the accepted halakhah. Perhaps Rabbi Akiva fears that if he reveals his true opinion, people may be tempted to follow it. In order to keep people away from Rabbi Eliezer he censors him. However, we should note that the editors of the Mishnah record this censorship instead of erasing it from any historical memory."

The Samaritans were a group whose holy city, Shechem, was found in the Shomron (Samaria). In some ways they would have acted like other Jews, but in many other ways they would have been different.

The rabbis look at this as if every day is the time when he should pay back the debt, and hence it is not a loan. However, if the storekeeper turns it into an official loan, for instance if he says something like, “You have until such and such a time to pay me back the money you owe me” then the debt is remitted in the seventh year. Rabbi Judah has a more nuanced view of when a debt to a store becomes a “loan.” The first time someone buys something from a shop without paying the debt is not a loan. However, the second time he does so, the prior debt turns automatically into a loan. Since it is a loan, the seventh year will cancel the debt.

Rabbi Yose says that whether or not the sabbatical year cancels the debt to the worker depends on whether the work can continue to be done on the seventh year. If the work cannot be done in the seventh year, then the debt to the worker automatically becomes a loan because the working arrangement has to stop.  However, if the work can continue to be done during the seventh year, for instance the worker was not working in the field, then the debt remains a debt and not a loan because the work could potentially continue."

Thus a loan taken out on the last day of the year will be remitted, but a loan taken out on the first day of the next year will not be remitted. What makes this more complicated is that Elul, the last month of the year can have either 29 or 30 days. That is to say that the 30th day after Rosh Hodesh Elul could either be the first day of the next year, Rosh Hashanah, or the last day of the previous year. Our mishnah describes a person who has slaughtered a cow and “registered” other people to receive parts of the cow. Once he divides up the meat and gives it to them they owe him the money, and our mishnah treats this like a loan. So if he divides up the meat on the 30th of Elul at the end of the sabbatical year, what our mishnah calls “Rosh Hashanah” because it could potentially be Rosh Hashanah, and then it turns out that they added a day to the month, thereby keeping that day part of the previous year, then the loan is remitted by the seventh year.

One who defames a virgin pays a fine of 100 shekels (Deuteronomy 22:19). These are not considered normal loans and hence the sabbatical year does not cause them to be remitted.

The second situation is one who transfers his debts to the court so that the court will collect the debts on his behalf. He does this before the seventh year is over. The prohibition of collecting a debt after the seventh year falls on the individual creditor and not on the court. Thus the court can collect these debts on the creditor’s behalf without the debts being remitted by the seventh year.

We shall see why Hillel made this takkanah inside the mishnah.<br>Section one: The prozbul was a document that a person would write before the seventh year and through it he would transfer his debts to the court. We shall learn more about how this document works in tomorrow’s mishnah. By using the prozbul document, a person’s could collect from his debtors after the seventh year.<br>Section two: At first it might seem that the prozbul would have been detrimental to the poor. After all, the sabbatical year was designed to give them relief from their debts by causing all loans to be remitted after the seventh year. However, the Torah already anticipated that this might cause lenders to be extremely hesitant about giving out loans. After all, these loans were an act of charity because they couldn’t charge interest.  Hillel saw that the sabbatical year’s remission of loans would ultimately cause the poor to suffer by making loans unavailable to them. Therefore, in order to aid people in getting loans, he had to secure the creditor’s ability to be repaid hence he enacted the prozbul."

As we learned in mishnah two, anyone who turns his debts over to a court does not have them remitted by the sabbatical year. So before the sabbatical year was over, the creditor would write out a document through which he would turn his debts over to the court. He would then have a right to collect them after the sabbatical year was over. This was the “legal fiction” through which Hillel prevented people from not loaning to the poor."

                    "<b>A pre-dated prozbul is valid, but a post-dated one, is invalid.</b>  If a prozbul was written in the month of Tevet, but the date written in it was Cheshvan, which comes before Tevet, the prozbul is still valid. This is because a pre-dated prozbul will be to the detriment only of the creditor since the prozbul will be effective only for loans given out before the prozbul is written. However, if he post-dates the prozbul, i.e. he writes it in Cheshvan but dates it to Tevet, the prozbul is invalid because this is to the benefit of the creditor and to the detriment of the borrower.",
                    "<b>Pre-dated loan documents [of loans] are invalid, but post-dated one valid.</b>  The mishnah now contrasts the prozbul with the loan documents themselves. If one pre-dates a loan document then it is invalid. This is because a loan document creates a lien on the other person’s property and may cause a third party to lose out. For instance, Reuven loans money to Shimon and the loan actually takes place in Nissan but he dates the document to Tishrei. Because the document was dated to Tishrei, the lien will be placed on any property Shimon owned in Tishrei. Thus if Levi bought property between Tishrei and Nissan and Shimon defaults on his loan, Reuven can collect his debt from Levi, even though the loan actually occurred after Levi bought the property. In such a case, there was no lien on Shimon’s property when Levi acquired it, and Reuven’s seizure from Levi is illegal. Therefore, pre-dated loan documents are invalid. However, post-dated loan documents are valid because they are only to the detriment of the creditor. Since no one else will lose out, these documents are valid.",
                    "<b>If one borrows from five persons, then he writes a separate prozbul for each [creditor]. But if five borrow from the same person, then he writes only one prozbul for them all.</b>  The prozbul is written for the creditor and not the borrower. Thus if one person borrows money from five different people, each creditor needs his own prozbul. However, if one person lends money to five different people, he needs only one prozbul in order to collect his debt after the seventh year."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn order to write a prozbul over a debt, the debtor must have land.  This is because the lien placed on the land by the debt makes it as if the debt has already been collected by the court at the point of the loan. Therefore when the creditor goes to collect the loan on behalf of the court through the use of the prozbul, it is as if he is collecting a loan that has already been collected. Thus this is not a violation of the prohibition of collecting a debt after the seventh year.\nOur mishnah teaches that this requirement can be in a sense “fictionalized” such that the debtor need not actually own land.",
                    "<b>A prozbul is written only for [a debt secured by] land.</b>  As I explained in the introduction above, in order for a prozbul to be written, the borrower must have land.",
                    "<b>But if [the debtor] has none, then [the creditor] can give him title to a share, however small, of his own field.</b>  The requirement for the debtor to have land may have made receiving a loan difficult, which is again a problem for the poor who are in most need of loans. If a prozbul cannot be written over a loan, a lender may be hesitant about loaning money to someone who really needs it (for instance a sharecropper, who may not own the land and may need a loan to pay for seed). Therefore, the creditor is allowed to give title to a piece of his land to the borrower. This title can in actuality be a fiction, whereby the creditor gives him the smallest piece of land possible on his own property and then he can write a prozbul on as large of a debt as he wishes.",
                    "<b>If he had land in pledge in a city, a prozbul can be written on it.</b>  If the debtor gave a piece of land as a pledge in order to secure another loan, the creditor may write a prozbul for a different loan, counting the pledged land as if it was actually still fully in the hands of the debtor. Again, we see that the rabbis are relaxing some of the requirements in order to make it easier for a person to write a prozbul so that he could take out a loan.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Hutzpit says: a prozbul may be written for a man on the security of his wife's property, or for an orphan on the security of property belonging to his guardian.</b>  Sometimes, a prozbul can be written for a person even though he does not actually own the property. For instance a man who does not own property but is married to a woman who does own property can have a prozbul written on the basis of his wife’s property. Similarly, orphans who don’t actually own property may have a prozbul written based on the property owned by their guardian."

The mishnah lists three consequences to this determination. 1) If the debtor owns a beehive, a prozbul may be written using just the beehive as security, even though he owns no actual land. This is a topic that we covered in yesterday’s mishnah. 2) Land and anything that is considered attached to it (such as plants or houses) is not susceptible to impurity. Thus, according to Rabbi Eliezer, the beehive cannot become impure. However, this is only true while it remains in its place. If the beehive was picked up and moved elsewhere, it can become susceptible to impurity. 3) One who plucks something from the land is liable for a Shabbat transgression. Hence, according to Rabbi Eliezer, one who removes honey from a beehive on Shabbat is liable.",

                    "<b>One who returns a debt [after] the seventh year, the [creditor] must say to [the debtor]: “I remit it.” But [the debtor] should say: “Even so [I will repay it].” [The creditor] may then accept it from him, because it says: “And this is the word of the release” (Deuteronomy 15:2).</b>  If a debtor comes to a creditor to repay a loan after the seventh year has caused his loan to be remitted, the creditor must tell the debtor that he need not repay the loan. He cannot simply accept it from him without saying anything.  However, once the creditor has said that he remits the loan, the debtor should say back to him, “Even so I will repay it.” The rabbis recognize that paying back a loan is a good thing and that a debtor who has the ability to pay back a loan should not use the seventh year as an excuse not to. Importantly, the mishnah notes that the creditor may accept his money back. It is prohibited for him to approach the borrower and demand repayment of the loan. But it is not prohibited for the creditor to accept the money back. This dialogue is derived midrashically from the words, “This is the word of the release,” which we would usually translate at “This is the matter of the release.” The Hebrew word for “matter” and “word” are the same. The rabbis derive from this phrase that it is sufficient for the creditor to say that the loan is remitted.  By saying such words, he fulfills his duty and if the borrower still wishes to repay the loan, the creditor may accept it from him.",

Therefore the rabbis derive a similar halakhah. When arriving at the refuge city the accidental killer must let the people of the city know that he is not coming as a simple tourist or person wishing to take up residence. He must tell them that he is an accidental killer. However, if they still wish to honor him even though they know he is an accidental killer, he may accept the honor."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn the final mishnah of Sheviit we learn that although one is not obligated to pay back a debt that has been remitted by the seventh year, the sages praise a debtor who does so in any case. Our mishnah teaches two other instances in which a person is not obligated to do something but nevertheless should do so. This is an important category in all forms of law, be it Jewish law or other forms of law. The law tells a person bottom-line what she/he has to do it does not always tell a person what he should do. There is a realm, in my opinion, of morality that goes beyond the law. This is the subject of our mishnah.",
                    "<b>One who repays his debts after the seventh year, the sages are pleased with him.</b>  As I noted in yesterday’s mishnah, it is praiseworthy to pay back a loan, even if it has been remitted by the seventh year. After all, the person really does owe the money. Perhaps we could say that he should take advantage of the sabbatical year remission only if he absolutely must do so.",
                    "<b>One who borrows from a convert whose sons had converted with him, the debt need not be repaid to his sons, but if he returns it the sages are pleased with him.</b>  Conversion is considered to be a process similar to birth a person is in a sense “born-again” when they convert. Therefore, they lose any legal ties to their parents or  children and according to Torah law, children who convert do not inherit from their parents. Therefore, if someone owes a convert money and the convert dies, technically he need not repay the convert’s children who were born before he converted (if they were born after he converted then they are legally considered his children). However, the rabbis praise a person who does repay this loan, because, after all, he does in reality owe the money, and we all know that in reality, these are his children.",
                    "<b>All movable property can be acquired [only] by the act of drawing, but whoever fulfills his word, the sages are well pleased with him.</b>  When a person acquires movable property, that is to say, things such as animals and objects, he must actually take them into his possession in order to acquire them. Money does not itself effect acquisition. Therefore, if Reuven buys, for instance, a table from Shimon and gives Shimon the money, the table is not his until he actually takes possession of it. Should Shimon find a better price for the table, he could sell it to someone else and just return the money to Reuven. Similarly, Reuven could ask for his money back if he finds a better table or a better price. However, the sages praise a person who keeps his word and does not renege on a deal, even when he is allowed to do so. Congratulations!  We have finished Sheviit! It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. As I wrote this commentary to Sheviit, Israel was beginning to observe a sabbatical year.  I am not adding plants to my garden and when I go to the store I check the labels on the produce I buy to make sure that I am not buying “sabbatical year produce.” While I know that most of the readers of this commentary yare living outside of Israel, everyone should know that many of the laws in this tractate are still influential and practiced in the land. Observing the shemittah in Israel and still maintaining a modern economy, all the while protecting the needs of farmers has been a great challenge to rabbis, and continues to be a major issue to this day. The tractate is also interesting because it is the most environmental tractate in the Mishnah. The Torah’s laws teach us that human beings do not ultimately possess the land they are merely sojourners on it, for the land actually belongs to God. It is clear, at least to me, that the greatest challenge that our generation and probably all future generations face, is the massive environmental damage humans have done and continue to do to our planet. We risk making the world simply an uninhabitable place to live. Sheviit teaches us that the land needs to rest, it needs to recover from all that we ask of it. While we may not be able to fulfill all of these laws the way that they were originally formulated, the message is one that resonates with greater alarm every day. I just hope that we listen in time to make a difference. Tomorrow we begin Tractate Terumot."
