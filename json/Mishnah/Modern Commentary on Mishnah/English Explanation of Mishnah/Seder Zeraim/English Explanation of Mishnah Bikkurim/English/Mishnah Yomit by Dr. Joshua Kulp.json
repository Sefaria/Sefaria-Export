        "Introduction": [
            "The first fruits of the seven species that Israel was “blessed with” (wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olive oil and date honey) must be brought to the Temple in Jerusalem and given to the priests. These fruits are called in Hebrew, bikkurim.  The Mishnah describes an elaborate procession whereby the people would carry decorated baskets in which they would place their first fruits. While many people would bring their first fruits during one of the pilgrimage festivals, either Shavuot or Sukkot, in order to avoid having to come to the Temple again, others would make special trips just to bring the bikkurim. These trips would have been occasions of great festivity. When a person hands his bikkurim over to the priest he has to make a formal declaration. This declaration is found in Deuteronomy 26 (see below) and is elaborated upon in the Mishnah. Tractate Bikkurim contains a fourth chapter that is not really part of the Mishnah. It was a medieval addition that was appended to the Mishnah from the Tosefta (a parallel tannaitic source). Nevertheless, we have included it in Mishnah Yomit because it is included in many printed editions of the Mishnah.  Below are the verses from the Torah which mention bikkurim.  ",
            "Exodus 23:19 The choice first fruits of your soil you shall bring to the house of the LORD your God. ",
            "Numbers 18:13 The first fruits of everything in their land, that they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone of your household who is clean may eat them.",
            "Deuteronomy 26  1When you enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you as a heritage, and you possess it and settle in it,  2 you shall take some of every first fruit of the soil, which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God is giving you, put it in a basket and go to the place where the LORD your God will choose to establish His name.  3 You shall go to the priest in charge at that time and say to him, \"I acknowledge this day before the LORD your God that I have entered the land that the LORD swore to our fathers to assign us.\"  4 The priest shall take the basket from your hand and set it down in front of the altar of the LORD your God.  5 You shall then recite as follows before the LORD your God: \"My father was a fugitive Aramean. He went down to Egypt with meager numbers and sojourned there; but there he became a great and very populous nation.  6 The Egyptians dealt harshly with us and oppressed us; they imposed heavy labor upon us.  7 We cried to the LORD, the God of our fathers, and the LORD heard our plea and saw our plight, our misery, and our oppression.  8 The LORD freed us from Egypt by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm and awesome power, and by signs and portents.  9 He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.  10 Wherefore I now bring the first fruits of the soil which You, O LORD, have given me.\" You shall leave it before the LORD your God and bow low before the LORD your God.  11 And you shall enjoy, together with the Levite and the stranger in your midst, all the bounty that the LORD your God has bestowed upon you and your household.",

Our mishnah clarifies that some people are obligated to bring the fruits and make the recitation, whereas others bring the fruits but don’t make the declaration and there are yet other types of people who need not bring bikkurim at all.<br>Section one: The mishnah describes a practice of grape-farmers to bury a vine into the ground in one place and then bring it up in another place. This would give the vine another place to derive water and nutrients from the ground without having to plant a whole new vine. The “new” vine looks new because it is coming out of the ground. However, it is not in reality new it is just the same vine as before coming up in a new place.<br>If a person puts a vine that begins on his property into the ground and then brings it up on property that is not his, he does not bring bikkurim. We will learn the reason why not in mishnah two.<br>Section two: The same is true if the vine begins on another’s property or on public property and he then brings it up out of the ground on his property. Even though the grapes will be harvested from his own property, he does not bring bikkurim.<br>Section three: In this case, the vine begins on his property, travels underneath another person’s private property or public property and then is brought up again on his property. The sages say that even though the vine begins and ends on his property he still does not bring. Rabbi Judah disagrees in this case (but not in the cases in sections one and two) and says that he does bring. Some commentators explain that Rabbi Judah disagrees only concerning a case where the vine traveled underneath public property. Rabbi Judah holds that a person can use the ground underneath public property for his own private use and therefore this is like a case where the entire vine grew on his property. The other rabbis hold that one cannot use the ground underneath public property and therefore, this is a case where the vine grew on property that did not belong to him. Rabbi Judah agrees that if the vine traveled underneath another’s private domain, he cannot bring bikkurim."

An “occupier” refers to a person who bought land that the government had confiscated from its legal owners (see Gittin 5:6). Such a person does not own the property until he compensates the original owner. Since none of the people listed in this section own the land on which they have grown the fruit none of them bring bikkurim."

This mishnah might shock the reader who is accustomed to the attitude that a convert is a “full Jew” and that the law does not discriminate against him/her. While this is largely true, and when it comes to legal rights, one cannot discriminate against a convert, the Mishnah does not accord full liturgical equality to the convert. The convert cannot recite “the Lord has sworn to our fathers” because his father was not an Israelite.",

It is interesting to note that the Mishnah does not take for granted that the reader knows that a person whose mother is Jewish is not a convert. It needs to clarify the matter perhaps because this law was not yet firmly established at the time when the Mishnah was composed.",

Rather, when he prays on his own he should say “our God, God of the fathers of Israel” and when he prays in the synagogue, probably as the prayer leader, he should say, “The God of your fathers.” I should note that this is no longer practiced.

In other words, a daughter of two converts cannot marry a priest. The same is true with regard to the daughter of freed slaves. Furthermore, the same law applies for all subsequent generations. This means that if the daughter of two converts marries another convert, their daughter cannot marry a priest.<br>The main place for this halakhah is Mishnah Kiddushin 4:7. In that mishnah R. Yose disagrees and holds that the daughter of two converts can marry an Israelite. This is the accepted halakhah. The priest is only restricted from marrying an actual convert. The source of this law is probably Ezekiel 44:22 which states, “For they (priests) shall take for themselves as wives a widow or a divorcee, but rather a virgin from the seed of Israel.” To Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, the daughter of converts is not considered to be from the seed of Israel.<br>Section two: One can bring bikkurim and make the recitation only if the land on which the fruit grew belongs to him. The guardian, the agent and the slave are all bringing bikkurim on behalf of another person. This is a legitimate way to send one’s bikkurim to the Temple but the person bringing fruit on behalf of another cannot recite the declaration.<br>A woman, a person of doubtful sex (meaning they don’t have physical signs of being either male or female) and a hermaphrodite (has both male and female genitalia) can all own land. However, they were not a part of the original inheritance of the land in the time of Joshua. At that point, according to rabbinic tradition, the land was only bequeathed to men, more specifically to men who could demonstrate that they were certain men. This is derived from the verse “Which You, O Lord, have given to me.” The “giving” here does not refer to the current status of the land all of these people can own land. Rather it refers to the original division of the Land. Since they cannot recite this line, they don’t make the recitation."

There is also a Psalm, called by our mishnah a song, that accompanies the bikkurim (we will see this in chapter three, mishnah four). When one presents the basket to the priest, he waves it as if it was a sacrifice (more on this below in 3:6). Finally, one who brings bikkurim to Jerusalem must spend the night there. This was probably done in order to help the innkeepers of Jerusalem make a living, and in order to aid in the festive atmosphere of the bikkurim procession.

While a person could bring his bikkurim to the Temple on his own, the mishnah prefers to describe a festive ceremony in which everyone from all of Israel would bring their bikkurim at the same time.<br>In Temple times the priests were divided into 24 “mishmarot.”  The main purpose of this division was that each week a different mishmar of priests would serve in the Temple. Parallel to the division of the priests, the other people were divided into “maamadot.” When a mishmar’s priests were serving in the Temple, the people of the corresponding maamad would gather in the synagogues and read from the beginning of the book of Genesis. Others from the maamad would go up to Jerusalem with the priests to serve as their region’s representatives when the Tamid daily sacrifice was being offered in the Temple. One person was designated the “Rosh Hamaamad” or the Head of the Maamad, and it was in his town that the people would gather.

The mishnah is easily understood, so I will comment here on a few interesting matters and refrain from commenting below.<br>Saul Lieberman, the preeminent scholar of rabbinic literature in the 20th century, wrote a book called Hellenism in Jewish Palestine, and in the book he devotes a chapter entitled, “Heathen Pre-Sacrificial Rites in the Light of Rabbinic Sources,” to the ritual described in our mishnah. Lieberman notes that the bikkurim ritual as described in this mishnah is not taken from the Bible, which makes no mention of such a ritual. Rather, certain elements are customs that are parallel to Greco-Roman sacrificial rituals, most significantly the ox with gilded horns. This was a common feature in sacrificial processions in the Roman Empire. Clearly, when Jews of the time came to create a new ritual, they did so based on what they saw in the non-Jewish world. However, Lieberman also notes that this is the only time the mishnah describes an ox with gilded horns. Such a practice was not done with regular sacrificial oxen used in the Temple. In other words, when it came to the heart of their ancient tradition, the Temple ritual, the Jews were less likely to adopt foreign practice than they were with innovative rituals that were performed outside of the Temple.<br>The other feature that I find interesting in this mishnah is the line, “according to the rank of the entrants they would go forth.” This means that important Temple and Jerusalem officials would go out to greet important guests, whereas lesser officials would greet lesser guests. This is of course not surprising and is indeed human nature, but it is still important to note that ritual often served and still does serve as an opportunity for human beings to emphasize their social hierarchy. We should think in our own lives how often our public rituals are often laden with issues concerning the social hierarchy."

Most of this mishnah is straightforward, so I will only deal with certain issues that come up in section two.<br>Section two: In the Second Temple period there were a few kings named Agrippas. A ccording to Albeck, the Mishnah refers to Agrippas I, who lived between 10 B.C.E-44 C.E. and ruled in the Galilee between 37-41 and became king of Judea from 41-44. He was the grandson of Herod the Great. He is also referred to favorably in Sotah 7:8. The mishnah there discusses a festive gathering which occurred on the last day of Sukkot at the end of the Sabbatical year. At that time they would read portions from Deuteronomy. The mishnah states:<br>The synagogue attendant takes a Torah scroll and hands it to the head of the synagogue, the head of the synagogue hands it to the deputy and he hands it to the high priest, and the high priest hands it to the king and the king stands and receives it, but reads it while sitting. King Agrippa stood and received it and read standing, and the sages praised him. When he reached, “You shall not place a foreigner over you” (ibid 17:15) his eyes ran with tears. They said to him, “Fear not, Agrippas, you are our brother, you are our brother!”<br>Just as he acted humbly in that mishnah by standing when he could have sat, so too in our mishnah, Agrippas is mentioned favorably, for he humbly puts the basket with the bikkurim in it on his shoulder, just as all other Jews did.<br>This mishnah serves as an interesting foil for yesterday’s mishnah. There we learned that the social status of the people visiting Jerusalem was emphasized by those coming out to greet them when they arrived. Today we see the opposite the very king of Israel would make sure that he acted in the same humble manner as everyone else. Perhaps this is also a tendency of human beings. We want to see our leaders act humbly, so that we can think of them as being “just like us.” On the other hand, we also want to elevate any small social advantage we have over others. Oh what fascinating creatures we are!"

He went down to Egypt with meager numbers and sojourned there; but there he became a great and very populous nation.\n6 The Egyptians dealt harshly with us and oppressed us; they imposed heavy labor upon us.\n7 We cried to the LORD, the God of our fathers, and the LORD heard our plea and saw our plight, our misery, and our oppression.\n8 The LORD freed us from Egypt by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm and awesome power, and by signs and portents.\n9 He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.\n10 Wherefore I now bring the first fruits of the soil which You, O LORD, have given me.\" You shall leave it before the LORD your God and bow low before the LORD your God.",

In contrast, if a priest receives bikkurim ornamentations from an am haaretz he needs to tithe them, just as one always needs to tithe produce received from an am haaretz.

Another reading of this mishnah says not “as may be done with a Torah” but “and a Torah scroll.” This would mean that one can use bikkurim to buy a Torah scroll.

While the doubt concerning the hermaphrodite’s sex is permanent, the “true” sex of the pseudo-hermaphrodite can, at least on occasion, be determined. Congratulations!  We have finished Bikkurim and Seder Zeraim! It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and the seder and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Wow! We have finished Seder Zeraim. We began this seder with Berakhot in June of 2007 and it is now March 2009 almost two full years have passed. For those of you who began learning Mishnah Yomit in the very beginning with Seder Nezikin we have been learning for about 5 years. Your commitment, whether you have been learning for years, months or weeks, is what keeps this program going. That’s the good news. The even better news is that we still have two seders to go, and they are going to be more challenging than the first four (why do you think we started with Nezikin?). Tomorrow we begin to learn Seder Kodashim which deals with sacrificial law and various other subjects related to the Temple. So look for the Introduction to Tractate Zevahim that will appear in your inbox tomorrow. But for now, kick back and feel good about having learned all of Seder Zeraim, and for some of you an entire 2/3 of the Mishnah. The end (at least our first run through, there is never a real end to learning) is only a few years away! Tomorrow we begin Tracate Zevahim."
