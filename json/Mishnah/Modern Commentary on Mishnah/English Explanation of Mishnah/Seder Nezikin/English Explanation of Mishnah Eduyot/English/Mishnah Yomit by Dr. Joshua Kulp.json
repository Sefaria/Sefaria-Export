                    "<b>Shammai says: “For all women [who begin to menstruate] it suffices [to reckon their impurity from] the time [of their discovering it].” And Hillel says: “[Their impurity is reckoned backwards] from the [last] examination to the [previous] examination, even if this covers many days.” But the Sages say:  “Neither according to the opinion of this one nor according to the opinion of this one, but [they are considered impure for] the past twenty four hours  when this lessens the period from the [last] examination to the [previous] examination, and for the period from the [last] examination to the [previous] examination when this lessens the past twenty-four hours.”</b>  This mishnah discusses a woman’s ritual impurity as a menstruant.  When a woman menstruates she makes impure certain things which she touches.  The problem is that a woman may not always know when she begins to menstruate, in order to know which things that she touched are impure.  Shammai is not concerned with this problem; he states that only things that they have touched after they discover that they are menstruating are impure.  Hillel is very considered about this problem; he states that anything touched after the last time she checked herself is impure.  In other words, since we cannot be certain when she began menstruating after the last time she checked, we are strict and anything from this time and onwards is impure.  The Sages, who probably lived after Shammai and Hillel, found a compromise position.  The things a menstruant touched before she discovered that she was menstruating are impure either within the last twenty-four hours or since she last checked, whichever was more recent.   For example if it is now Tuesday afternoon and she checked herself on Tuesday morning, anything she touched between the morning and the afternoon is assumed to be impure.  If however, it is now Tuesday afternoon and she checked herself Monday morning, anything she touched in the last twenty-four hour period is impure.",
                    "<b>Any woman who has a regular period, it suffices [to reckon her impurity from] her set time.</b>  Any woman who has a regular cycle, begins to make things impure only from the moment she realizes that she is menstruating.  It can be assumed that this woman did not begin menstruating at an earlier time since she has a regular cycle.",
                    "<b>She who uses testing-cloths [when she has sexual relations], behold this is like an examination: it lessens either the period of the [past] twenty four hours or the period from the [last] examination to the [previous] examination.</b>  If a woman wipes herself clean after having relations with her husband, this counts as checking herself.  If within the next twenty-four hours she should realize that she is menstruating, she has made impure only those things which she touched since she had relations and cleaned herself."

                    "<b>Shammai says:  “[Dough] of a kav or more is subject to the law of hallah.” And Hillel says: “Of two kavs or more.” But the Sages say: “Neither according to the opinion of this one nor according to the opinion of this one, but [dough of] a kav and a half is subject to the law of hallah.”</b>  Numbers 15:20-21 commands Jews to set aside some of their dough and give it to the priests.  This is called “hallah”.  The question is how big of a batch of dough makes a person liable to separate hallah?  According to Shammai, if one mixes one kav of dough he must separate hallah to give to the priests.  A kav is about 1 ½ liters. According to Hillel, two kavs of dough make one obligated to separate hallah.  The Sages compromise between the two positions and state that 1 ½ kavs is sufficient to obligate for hallah.",
                    "<b>And after they increased the measures they said:  “[Dough of] five quarters is subject. Rabbi Yose said:  “Five are exempt, five and more are liable.”</b>  Later in the Mishnaic period, in Tsippori which is in the Galilee, the measure of weights were increased so that a kav was now larger than it used to be.  Therefore, the amount that obligates one to separate hallah became 1 1/5 kavs.  According to Rabbi Yose, exactly 1 1/5 kavs does not obligate one to separate hallah, but anything over that amount does.",
                    "<b>Questions for Further Thought:</b><br>• Why should there be a minimum amount of dough to make one liable to separate hallah?  Why shouldn’t a person have to separate hallah from even a small amount of dough?"

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nMishnah three contains a dispute between Hillel and Shammai with regards to the laws of the mikveh (ritual bath).",
                    "<b>Hillel says:  “A hin full of drawn water renders the mikweh unfit.” (However, man must speak in the language of his teacher.) And Shammai says:  “Nine kavs.” But the Sages say: “Neither according to the opinion of this one nor according to the opinion of this one;” But when two weavers from the dung-gate which is in Jerusalem came and testified in the name of Shemaiah and Avtalion, “Three logs of drawn water render the mikweh unfit,” the Sages confirmed their statement.</b> A mikveh, a ritual bath used to cleanse ritual impurity, must contain water that has not been drawn by human hands.  The water must get into the mikveh by natural means, either through rain or a stream.  The question our mishnah asks is how much drawn water can fall into a mikveh before it becomes unfit to cleanse?  According to Hillel, if one hin falls in, the mikveh is unfit.  A hin is equal to three kavs (about 4 ½ liters).  The mishnah notes that Hillel used the word “hin” and not the word “kav”, even though kav is more commonly used and Hillel himself used the word in the previous mishnah.  The answer is that Hillel heard this law about the mikveh from his teacher in this language, and although Hillel himself did not regularly use this language he still taught the statement in the form that he heard it.  This is to teach that when you quote your teacher you must use the same language s/he used. Shammai gives a larger measure which would make a mikveh unfit:  nine kavs.  A smaller amount of drawn water that falls into a mikveh does not render it unfit. As we saw in the first two mishnayoth, the Sages accept neither the words of Shammai nor the words of Hillel.  Rather they accept the testimony given by two weavers who were at the Dung-Gate in Jerusalem (the gate next to the Western Wall), who said that Shemaiah and Avtalion, two early Sages, stated that three lugs, which is a quarter of a hin, are enough to render the mikveh unfit."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nMishnah four discusses why the Mishnah records opinions that are not accepted as normative Jewish law (halakhah).",
                    "<b>And why do they record the opinions of Shammai and Hillel for naught? To teach the following generations that a man should not [always] persist in his opinion, for behold, the fathers of the world did not persist in their opinion.</b> This mishnah, and the two mishnayoth which we will learn tomorrow ask deep questions about the nature of the Mishnah in its totality.  In the previous two mishnayoth we learned statements of Shammai and Hillel that were not accepted as normative law.  Indeed, throughout this year of learning we have read and discussed many statements that are not law in our days, nor in the days in which those statements were recited.  Why then does the Mishnah record and do we continue to learn these statements?  One answer, the answer that our mishnah provides, is to teach that just as Shammai and Hillel compromised and changed their minds when they saw they were contradicted, and they were the “fathers of the world”, the founders of Rabbinic Judaism, all the more so should lesser people change their mind when they realize that they may be wrong.  The mishnah then becomes a lesson not in argumentation, but in compromise and unity.  The mishnah records minority opinions to show that even great teachers change their mind when wrong.  We will learn other reasons tomorrow."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah discusses the question why are minority opinions recorded in the Mishnah, if there is a rule that the halakhah (the law) is according to the majority opinion.",
                    "<b>And why do they record the opinion of a single person among the many, when the halakhah must be according to the opinion of the many? So that if a court prefers the opinion of the single person it may depend on him. For no court may set aside the decision of another court unless it is greater than it in wisdom and in number. If it was greater than it in wisdom but not in number, in number but not in wisdom, it may not set aside its decision, unless it is greater than it in wisdom and in number.</b> Generally speaking, when there is a dispute in the Mishnah between an individual Sage and the rest of the Sages, the halakhah is according to the Sages.  This is due to a “majority rules” principle.  Our mishnah asks why then, does the Mishnah record the minority opinion, if that is not to be the accepted halakhah?  Before we begin to discuss the answer, which is somewhat difficult to decipher, we should recognize the importance of the question.  The Mishnah is not purely a book of halakhah, Jewish law, because it contains a plurality of opinions.  In my mind this makes an important statement about Judaism and Jewish law:  the first great work of the Oral Torah, that work which continues to shape Judaism to this very day, is not a recording of what one is supposed to do.  It records a dialogue between the Sages, meant to be learned and extrapolated.  This is the process of “Talmud Torah” that continues to this day.  Furthermore, the Mishnah teaches that minority opinions are not necessarily “wrong” even though they may not be accepted. The answer the mishnah provides to its question is slightly cryptic.  I will explain it in one way, but there are others who have explained it differently.  The mishnah records the opinions of individual Sages so that future courts might rely on their opinions and decide halakhah according to them.  Although at the time of the Mishnah these opinions were not accepted by the majority, since they are not “wrong”, in the future other courts may accept them. If a future court were to disagree with the opinions of an earlier court, and there was no recorded minority opinion, they could only change the decision if they were both wiser and greater in number than the earlier court.  In other words there are two ways, according to our mishnah, that a future court can overturn an earlier decision:  1)  by relying on a minority opinion; 2) by being greater in number and wisdom."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nMishnah six contains a different answer to the same question asked in mishnah five:  why are minority opinions recorded in the mishnah.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah said:  “If so, why do they record the opinion of a single person among the many to set it aside?   So that if a man shall say, ‘Thus have I received the tradition’, it may be said to him, ‘According to the [refuted] opinion of that individual did you hear it.’”</b> Rabbi Judah asks the same question that was asked in the previous mishnah:  why does the Mishnah record minority opinions.  His answer, however, is the exact opposite of the previous answer.  According to Rabbi Judah, minority opinions are recorded so that future Rabbis will not be able to rely on those opinions.  If a person in the future should say that he learned the tradition in a certain way, a Rabbi could point to the Mishnah and tell him that that is a minority opinion and is therefore not accepted as halakhah. Halakhah according to Rabbi Judah will continue to follow the majority. Note the irony that the Mishnah records a dispute about why it preserves minority opinions, and in this very discussion there is a recorded minority opinion.  If we were to look at this dispute in these two mishnayoth through the eyes of those who gave the first answer, they would have to say that in the future Rabbi Judah’s answer might be acceptable!  In other words those who allow for a change in the halakhah, must admit that in the future such change might not be acceptable.  If we were to look at the same dispute through Rabbi Judah’s eyes, we would have to say that this opinion is unaccepted now and forever!  Meaning, Rabbi Judah himself would have to admit that minority opinions are acceptable in the future, in which case, perhaps, even his minority opinion would someday be accepted.",

Our mishnah discusses how many bones must be in the tent for them to be considered a dead body which will cause ritual impurity.<br>According to Beth Shammai, a quarter-kav of bones will transmit impurity, as long as they come from at least two or three different bones.  Beth Hillel agrees that a quarter-kav of bones is enough to cause impurity but they state that the bones must either come from the greater portion of the body (the hips, thighs, rib cage and spine) or from a majority of the number of bones in the body, considered to be 248.  If there is a quarter-kav but they come from only one limb or many limbs but not a majority of the number or from the greater portion, they do not transmit impurity.<br>Shammai himself is even stricter than Beth Shammai, for he holds that a quarter-kav from one bone transmits impurity."

It is only given from human food and not from animal feed.  Vetches, a type of bean, are generally given to animals, but can be eaten by humans in time of need.<br>2) It is forbidden to cause terumah to become impure.  A person who touches terumah must have previously ritually washed his hands.<br>3) Food can receive impurity only once it has been made wet.  While it is dry it cannot receive impurity.<br>Our mishnah discusses the preparation of vetches of terumah.  According to Beth Shammai they must be prepared (both soaked and rubbed) with pure hands, lest the person decide to eat them himself, in which case it would be forbidden to make them impure.  However, they may be given to animals by a person with impure hands, since animal food is not really terumah.<br>According to Beth Hillel, they must be soaked by a person with pure hands, since getting them wet enables them to receive impurity.  However, when he rubs them or gives them to an animal it is obvious that they are not intended for humans, and therefore he can do so with impure hands.<br>Shammai himself is again, stricter than Beth Shammai.  He holds that vetches must be eaten dry so that they will not be able to receive impurity.  Assumedly, Shammai would agree that a person might also eat them with clean hands.<br>Rabbi Akiva’s opinion is the most lenient.

If it was inconvenient to carry all of the second tithe produce to Jerusalem, one could redeem the produce with money and bring the money to Jerusalem.  Our mishnah discusses a person who has already redeemed some second tithe and wishes to exchange his small copper coins for a larger more valuable silver coin, a sela, which will be easier to carry to Jerusalem. According to Beth Shammai, in order to do this he must have a whole sela’s worth of copper coin.  If he has only half a sela’s worth of copper (=shekel) and he has a silver shekel (=1/2 sela) which is also of second tithe, he may not exchange the shekel and shekel’s worth of copper for a sela since it is forbidden to exchange silver second tithe for other silver second tithe. According to Beth Hillel, one is permitted to exchange a silver shekel and a shekel’s worth of copper coins for a sela.  Although it is in general forbidden to exchange silver second tithe for other silver second tithe, since part of this exchange is copper, it is permitted. Rabbi Meir limits Beth Hillel’s opinion.

According to Beth Shammai he must exchange the entire sela for copper.

According to Beth Hillel, he may exchange half of the sela for a silver shekel and the other half for copper.  Again, Beth Hillel holds that since he is exchanging part of the sela for copper he may also exchange part for silver. Rabbi Akiva takes Beth Hillel’s position even further.  A person may exchange even ¼ of the sela (denar) for copper and the rest (3/4) for silver.  A sela is worth four denars. Rabbi Tarfon goes even further.  For the fourth denar he may even take four aspers of silver and one asper’s worth of copper.  An asper is 1/5 of a denar. Shammai again is strictest.

If you are going to allow her to remarry, as we have already done, for which there are serious consequences (if it turned out that her husband had not died), all the more so should she collect the kethubah payment, for which there are not such serious consequences (at worst she will have to pay it back).

In other words, Beth Hillel brings proof from another area of law that with regards to monetary issues, this man’s death is not considered confirmed.  To this Beth Shammai responds that we can learn that she collects her kethubah payment from the language written in the kethubah itself.  The kethubah states that if she remarries, she may collect her kethubah payment.  From this wording Beth Shammai concludes that any time she is allowed to remarry, she may collect her kethubah.

This situation could arise if a slave was owned by two masters and one of them set his half free.  Beth Hillel allows such a situation to persists and rules that one day a week he should work for his master and one day a week he works for himself.  In other words, this person can remain a half-slave.<br>Beth Shammai remarks to Beth Hillel that this is a fine arrangement for the master, but does not solve an essential problem for the slave.  A slave is permitted to marry a female slave but a regular Jew is not allowed to marry a female slave.  The half of this person who is a slave could marry a female slave but not a free Jewish woman, and the half of this person who is a Jew (when slaves are freed they become Jewish) could marry a Jewish woman but not a slave woman.  Since this problem is irreconcilable, he could not marry anyone.  Beth Shammai points out that this is also not an acceptable situation, and contradicts the existence of the entire creation.  God created people so that they could establish families and not so that they could remain celibate.<br>The only solution is that he must be freed by the one remaining master, who writes him a manumission document. The slave then accepts upon himself a debt to pay back his owner and the slave goes free.<br>When Beth Hillel heard Beth Shammai’s argument they accepted it, and taught like them.<br>We should note how truly remarkable this mishnah is.  Slavery was an accepted institution in the ancient world, and in every society slaves were amongst the lowest of the social classes.  Nevertheless, Beth Shammai is concerned that even slaves should have the opportunity to fulfill the purpose of the creation of the world:  procreation."

If this vessel is found in a room with a dead body, which would normally cause everything in the room to be impure, the clay vessel and all that is inside of it does not contract the impurity.  Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel argue about what types of things which may be inside the clay vessels are not impure.  According to Beth Hillel any object inside the vessel is pure.  Beth Shammai holds that only food, liquids and other clay vessels remain pure; non-clay vessels would be impure.<br>Beth Shammai explains that we can assume that the clay vessel has been touched by an ignoramus (am haaretz), a person who does not strictly know or observe the laws of ritual purity.  It is assumed that the am haaretz makes the vessel impure.  Since an impure vessel does not prevent the impurity from entering, the things inside of it are impure.<br>Beth Hillel responds to Beth Shammai by pointing out that they did indeed accept that the food and liquids inside the vessel were pure.  If the clay vessel does not prevent impurity from entering, why should anything inside of it remain pure?<br>To this question Beth Shammai responds that when they stated that the food and liquids were pure they meant for the am haaretz himself and not for the haver (a person who scrupulously observes the laws of purity and indeed eats only pure food). Beth Shammai assumes that a haver will not borrow any of these things from an am haaretz, since they cannot be made pure (a clay vessel cannot be cleansed of its impurity).  Therefore Beth Shammai can pronounce these things clean, knowing that they will never come into the hands of a haver.  However, when Beth Hillel pronounced everything inside pure, they were in essence declaring it pure for both the am haaretz and the haver.  Beth Hillel had implied that even metal vessels, inside the clay vessel, remained pure.  A haver might borrow metal vessels from an am haaretz, with the intent of immersing them to cleanse them of their impurities.  However, this immersion will only cleanse them from light impurities and not from impurity contracted from a dead body.  Therefore, an am haaretz might borrow them thinking that he could cleanse them and in reality he could not.  Due to this problem, Beth Hillel retracted their opinion and taught like Beth Shammai."

                    "<b>Rabbi Hanina, chief of the priests, testified concerning four matters:<br>Through all their days the priests never refrained from burning meat which had been defiled by an “offspring” of impurity with meat which had been made impure by a “father” of impurity, although they were [thereby] increasing its impurity by a [higher] impurity. Rabbi Akiba added:  “Through all their days the priests never shrank from lighting oil  which had been rendered unfit by a tevul yom in a lamp made impure by one who was made impure by a corpse, although they were [thereby] increasing its impurity by a [higher] impurity.”</b> In order to understand the first “testimony” of Rabbi Hanina we must explain some rules concerning impurity.  There are a number of things which are considered to be “fathers” of impurity, including a human corpse.  If a “father” of impurity touches something it becomes an “offspring” of impurity.  There are several levels of “offspring” of impurity.  The “first offspring”, when it touches food or liquids (but not people and things) causes them to be a “second offspring”.  “Second offspring” makes only terumah food but not normal food into “third offspring”.  “Third offspring” can make holy things such as sacrifices into “fourth offspring”. Rabbi Hanina testifies that the priests did not refrain from burning meat which had been made impure by an “offspring” with meat that had been made impure by a “father” of impurity, even though the latter meat, which is a “first offspring” increases the impurity of the former meat, which according to the Talmud had been a “third offspring”, to the status of “second offspring”.  The reason is that all of this meat was going to be burned anyway, since impure sacrifices are forbidden to eat.  Although it is generally forbidden to intentionall make sacrifices impure, that refers to already pure sacrifices.  It is not a problem to increase the impurity of already impure sacrifices. Rabbi Akiva adds another example.  The priests did not refrain from burning oil which had contracted a light form of impurity with oil that had contracted a serious form of impurity, even though this will increase the impurity of the oil.  The light form of impurity is contracted by coming into contact with a “tevul yom”, one who had already been immersed in a ritual bath and was merely waiting for the sunset to become fully pure.  The serious form of impurity is that which is contracted from a corpse."

If it is found to be unfit after it’s hide is flayed, the priests may keep the hide.  Rabbi Hanina testifies that he never saw a hide being burnt.  In other words, according to Rabbi Hanina if they already removed the hide, the priests may make use of it, even though the animal was deemed unfit to be a sacrifice. Rabbi Akiva learns from this that if one flays the hide of a firstborn animal, which belongs to the priests, and then discovers that it was a trefah, an animal with an internal flaw that would have caused its death, the priests may keep the hide.  Since the flaw was not known before the hide was removed, the hide becomes the property of the priests. The Sages respond to Rabbi Akiva that the type of testimony that Rabbi Hanina transmitted is not reliable enough to base upon it halakhic solutions.  Not seeing something does not mean that it did not happen.  Since they exclude Rabbi Hanina’s testimony the law is that the hide must be burnt with the rest of the animal, and the priests are forbidden to receive benefit from it."

He testified that he saw an elder in a town near Jerusalem who used to write out his own loan documents and have others sign them and the Sages pronounced it legal, even though the witnesses did not write out the entire document themselves.  Without Rabbi Hananyah’s testimony we might have thought that the lender is not allowed to write out the document himself, for fear that he would forget a document and thereby falsely claim that someone owed him money. From Rabbi Hananyah’s testimony we learn that a woman is allowed to write out her own divorce document and a man might right out his own receipt for having paid the woman’s ketubah (marriage payment).

The needle was known to have been made impure by a dead body and the question is being asked, are the knife that had been used to slaughter the animal and the person who slaughtered the animal impure from having had contact with the impure needle.  Rabbi Hananyah testifies that the knife and slaughterer are not impure but the flesh of the sacrifice is impure, for the needle surely came into contact with it.  The reason that the knife and slaughterer are still pure is that doubtful cases of impurity in the public domain are considered pure.  The flesh does not make the knife impure because food does not impart impurity to vessels. If, however, the needle was found in the feces of the animal, the knife, slaughterer and even the flesh are pure, because we cannot be sure that the animal’s flesh touched the needle.  Although we could assume that the animal swallowed the needle and therefore it touched the flesh, this is not certain and therefore, since this happened in the public domain, the rules are lenient."

Although one verse from Exodus seems to say that God counts years, a few verses later generations are mentioned.  According to Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation of these verses and his theology, a person’s years are determined by his actions and by his father’s actions, and not predetermined by God.

If one were to say Kaddish for a full twelve months, it would be assuming that the parent was wicked.  Since no one would want to make such a statement, we say Kaddish for eleven months.

                    "<b>Introduction</b> The first six mishnayoth of this chapter contain ten disputes between Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas and the Sages.",
                    "This is a complicated mishnah, which requires the knowledge of some rules before we begin to explain the details. 1) A corpse causes impurity in three ways: a) by contact, b) by being carried; c) by being under the same roof-space, referred to as a tent. 2) Certain parts of a dead body impart impurity even though there is not a full corpse. 3) In order for a part of a corpse to impart impurity it must have a minimum measure the size of an olive. 4) Tent impurity is contracted in three ways: i) If a corpse, or part thereof, is found under a roof structure, anything under that roof structure is impure. ii) If the corpse, or part thereof, is above a person or vessel, the corpse imparts impurity. iii) If the person or vessel is above the corpse, the person and vessel are impure. Our mishnah discusses the ability of two pieces of a corpse, that are smaller than an olive, to join together and make a piece of corpse larger than an olive and transmit impurity in different situations.",
                    "<b>[In the case of] all things which cause defilement in a “tent”, if they [the pieces of the corpse] were divided and brought into the house, Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas pronounces [everything under the same roof-space] clean, but the Sages pronounce it unclean.</b>  This is an introduction to the mishnah.  Here we learn that if two pieces of a dead body smaller than an olive but together the size of an olive are found under one roof, Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinos declares that they do not join to impart impurity and the Sages declare that they do join.",
                    "<b>How so? He who touches as much as two halves of an olive [in quantity] of an animal’s carcass or carries them; or in the case of a [human] corpse, he who touches as much as half an olive and stands over as much as half an olive; or touches as much as half an olive and as much as half an olive is above him; or if he stands over as much as two halves of an olive; or if he stands over as much as half an olive and as much as half an olive is above him Rabbi Dosa b. Harkinas pronounces him clean, and the Sages pronounce him unclean. </b>  The mishnah now goes over all of the different examples in which the Sages and Rabbi Dosa dispute. A. If one touches or carries two separate pieces of a dead animal, each the size of half an olive.  Note that there is no tent impurity caused by dead animals, and therefore this example mentions only carrying and contact. B. If one touches a piece of corpse the size of half an olive and makes a tent, over another piece the same size (rule 4iii above). C. A person forms a tent over two half-olive size pieces of a corpse. D. A person forms a tent over one half-olive size piece of corpse and one half-olive size piece of corpse forms a tent over him. In all of these case Rabbi Dosa declares that the pieces of corpse do not join together.",
                    "<b>But if he touches as much as half an olive [in quantity] and another thing was over him and over as much as half an olive; or if he stood over as much as half an olive and another thing was over him and over as much as half an olive, he is clean.</b> In this section are listed two cases where the Sages would agree with Rabbi Dosa that he is pure. A. If one touches a half-olive size piece of corpse and something else forms a tent over him and a half-olive size piece, he is still pure. B. If one forms a tent over a half-olive size piece of corpse, and something else forms a tent over him and another half-olive size piece of corpse, he is still pure. The reason why in this case the Sages declare him pure is that the two types of impurity are of a different nature.  When something forms a tent over a person and a piece of corpse that is considered to be tent impurity, whereas when a person forms a tent over a piece of corpse or a piece of corpse forms a tent over him, that is considered contact impurity.  In the cases in section two, there were two kinds of contact impurity; hence the two half-olives joined to transmit impurity.  In the cases in section three, one piece of corpse transmitted tent impurity and the other contact impurity.  Hence the Sages agree that he is pure.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Meir said: “Also in this case Rabbi Dosa pronounces him clean and the sages pronounce him unclean. In all such cases a man is unclean unless there is an act of touching and also an act of carrying, or an act of carrying and also [the fact of] being under the same roof-space.”</b>  Rabbi Meir holds that even in these cases the Sages would declare the person impure, and Rabbi Dosa would say he is pure.  Rabbi Meir explains that according to the Sages tent impurity and contact impurity do join.  The only type of impurity that does not join is contact impurity with carrying impurity.",
                    "<b>This is the general rule: in whatever case the means of causing defilement are of one category, he is unclean; if they are of two categories, he is clean.”</b> This is a general rule that summarizes the whole mishnah.  Any time there are two pieces of corpse transmitting impurity, they join only if they are transmitting a type of impurity with the same name. According to Rabbi Dosa none of the three types of impurity, tent, carrying and contact join together. According to the first version of the Sages opinion, contact and tent impurity do not join. According to Rabbi Meir, contact and tent impurity join but carrying and contact impurity and carrying and tent impurity do not join. Congratulations!  You just learned a very difficult mishnah.  If you couldn’t follow all the details do not despair.  This was probably one of the most complicated mishnayoth we have seen yet."

According to Rabbi Dosa one may redeem this second tithe even with a coin that does not have a stamp upon it.  According to the Sages it must have a stamp.  This is learned from Deuteronomy 14:25, which says “money” in connection with second tithe.",
                    "<b>The hands [alone] need to be immersed for the waters of purification according to Rabbi Dosa. But the Sages say: “If his hands have become unclean his whole body becomes unclean.”</b>  A person whose hands have become impure by touching impure food (but not a corpse, which would cause impurity to the whole body), need only wash his hands before touching the waters of purification which are used to purify someone who has contracted corpse impurity.  This is according to Rabbi Dosa.  The Sages disagree and say that with regards to touching waters of purification, if his hands are impure his whole body is impure.  To become pure he would need to take a ritual bath (mikveh)."

Since these are not considered food, and the laws of terumah are only applicable to food, these things may be eaten by non-priests.  The Sages forbid this.

In our mishnah Rabbi Dosa and the Sages disagree about the minimum weight of the fleeces of the sheep which would cause them to be subject to these laws.  According to Rabbi Dosa a person is not liable to give these shearings to the priest unless he has five female sheep and each fleece weighs a mina and a half, about 150 grams.  Less than this is not even considered “shearings”.  The Sages disagree.

Midras impurity is a type of impurity which is received by a zav sitting or lying down on an object.  Only things that are typically sat on or lied down upon can receive this type of impurity.  According to Rabbi Dosa, mats can receive corpse impurity by coming into contact with a dead body, or a part thereof.  However, since the mats under discussion are not used for sitting or for lying down, they cannot receive midras impurity.  The Sages hold that they can, since they are occasionally used for such a purpose.",

As we learned on several occasions, only things that are formed vessels or clothing can receive impurity.  Since network is not really clothing, it cannot receive impurity.  The only exception to this rule about things made of nets is a type of girdle which is a piece of clothing and therefore can be made impure.  The Sages disagree.

If the pocket is woven, all agree that it is liable to receive impurity.  However, if it is of leather, Rabbi Dosa hold that it may not receive impurity.  This is based on two rules:  1)  a strip of leather must be five handbreadths wide by five handbreadths long in order to receive impurity.  Since a sling is not this large, it does not receive impurity due to its size and significance.  2)  Rabbi Dosa does not consider the sling to be a “vessel” which inherently is receptive to impurity.  The Sages disagree.  They hold that a sling is inherently a vessel and therefore the pouch receives impurity no matter what it is made out of and no matter what size its pouch is. If the finger-hold is broken off the sling is unusable, and therefore cannot receive impurity. However, if the string-handle, which is attached to the pouch and is pulled back to throw the rock which is in the sling, is broken, the sling can still receive impurity, since it can be used."

But the Sages say: “There is a female captive who may eat, and there is a female captive who may not eat. How is this so? The woman who said: ‘I was taken captive but [nonetheless] I am pure’, she may eat; because the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permit. But if there are witnesses [who declare] that she was made a captive, and she says: ‘[nonetheless] I am pure’, she may not eat.”</b> This mishnah discusses a woman who was married to a priest or an unmarried daughter of a priest who is taken captive.  These two types of women, prior to having been taken captive, could certainly have eaten terumah.  According to the halakhah, a woman who has had sexual relations, even against her will, with someone with whom it is forbidden to do so, can no longer eat terumah.  The issue in our mishnah is, do we assume that a woman who was taken captive by a non-Jew was raped by the non-Jew and therefore can no longer eat terumah.  According to Rabbi Dosa, we do not make such an assumption, and she may continue to eat terumah unless there is evidence that she has been raped. According to the Sages, this is not always true. Her ability to eat terumah will depend on the circumstances in which the court found out that she had been taken captive.  If she came in front of the court and stated that she had been taken captive but that she was still pure, i.e. she had not been violated by the captor, she may continue to eat terumah.  This is due to a legal principle known as “the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permit”.  It means that if a person makes a statement that is to his own detriment and then makes another related statement to his benefit, he is believed in both statements.  Since he could have said nothing, and thereby not aroused any suspicion about himself, he is believed when he exculpates himself from that suspicion.  For instance, if Reuven says to Shimon, “this piece of land of mine used to be your father’s but now he sold it to me.”  Reuven is admitting that the land he owns was not always his, but he also says that he bought it. Telling Shimon that it was his father’s is “forbidding” it and stating that he bought it is “permitting” it.  In our case, if the woman says that she was taken captive, she has “forbidden” herself by creating a suspicion that she may have had relations with the captor.  When she says that she did not she is believed. However, if there are witnesses who testify that she had been taken captive, then when she denies having been violated by the captor, she is not believed.  Since she did not “forbid” but rather the witnesses did, the rule of “the mouth that forbade is the same mouth that permit” is not applicable here."

In all of these situations Rabbi Joshua rules that the previously pure person is now impure, whereas the Sages hold that he is still pure. The cases are: i + ii)  A case where one of the people is moving and one is stationary.  In this case Rabbi Joshua pronounces the person impure due to the general rule that doubtful cases of impurity which occur in the private domain are ruled impure.  The Sages say that he is pure. Although there is a general rule that doubtful cases of impurity that occur in the private domain are ruled impure, this is true only when the pure and the impure are either both moving or both stationary.  If their status is different, then the rule is not applicable. iii + iv)  The pure and impure are in different domains, one in the public domain and one in the private domain.

They dispute over four items:<br>1) The covering of a metal basket which belongs to a householder.  In another tractate we learn that there is a difference between this type of covering if it is owned by a doctor.  The doctors used these coverings for various uses, and therefore everyone agrees that they are susceptible to impurity.  Rabban Gamaliel holds that a covering of this type of basket is used by non-professionals as well, and is therefore susceptible to impurity even if it belongs to a non-professional (a householder).  The Sages disagree.<br>2) The hanger of a strigil.  A strigil was a type of comb used during baths to scrape off dead skin.  All agree that the strigil itself is susceptible to impurity.  They disagree about the small chain attached to the strigil to hang it on a hook.  According to Rabban Gamaliel it too is considered a vessel and therefore receives impurity.  According to the Sages it does not.<br>3) Generally speaking, unformed vessels cannot receive impurity.  However, when it comes to metal vessels that have not been fully finished, in other words they have not been polished, Rabban Gamaliel holds that they are susceptible to impurity, since they can be used.

This rule has a limitation:  one may cook on the festival only to eat that day, and not to prepare food for later.  It is even forbidden to prepare food on a festival for the Sabbath, since that would be considered an insult to the honor of the festival.  However, since this was necessary in cases where the Sabbath fell after the festival, the Sages developed something which is known as “eruv tavshilin”.  A person would symbolically begin to cook a meal for the Sabbath on the day before the festival.  Since he had already begun to cook for the Sabbath, he was allowed to cook other things on the festival for the Sabbath.  This is a type of legal fiction still practiced today by halakhic Jews.  According to Beth Shammai, if a person must create a separate type of “eruv tavshilin” for each type of cooking he wishes to do:  if he wants to bake he must begin baking before the festival; if he wants to boil he must begin boiling before the festival.  Rabban Gamaliel rules that it is forbidden to wrap food to make it retain its heat, since that is not part of the “eruv tavshilin” that he had made before the holiday.  Beth Hillel would have allowed such an action, since Beth Hillel holds that all one must begin to do is cook a little bit, and that is sufficient to continue to do any cooking activities on the festival.",

This is meant to prevent one from making too much bread on the festival, lest he make some for after the festival.  Beth Hillel holds that it is permitted to bake large loaves, since bread cooks better when the oven is full.

Rabban Gamaliel testifies that his father’s house indeed acted in this manner, and only baked wafer-cakes on the festival.  The other Sages accept this testimony of Rabban Gamaliel as being an accurate description of what Rabban Gamaliel’s father’s house used to do, but they understand its significance differently.

This is true even for a person’s animal, since it is forbidden to make one’s animal perform work on the Sabbath.  Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah allowed his cow to go out with a strap between its horns, since this strap was only an adornment and therefore he did not consider it “work”.  In the same way a person can wear clothing in the public domain and that is not considered carrying.  However, the Sages forbid cows from carrying anything, since most cows do not do so.  Furthermore, if others were to see this they would think that it is permitted for an animal to work on the Sabbath.<br>Section two:  Rabbi Eleazar permits a person to curry an animal on the festival, even though that might cause a wound.  Currying is a type of combing done with a sharp metal comb.  Rabbi Eleazar permits this activity since even if he causes a wound he did not intend to do so and unintentionally performed work is permitted on the Sabbath.  In section four, Rabbi Judah states that currying is forbidden since it will cause a wound, but combing with a wooden comb is permitted since it will not cause a wound.  In section five the Sages state that even combing is forbidden, lest by permitting combing one might assume that currying is also permitted.<br>Section three:  Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah permits the grinding of peppercorns on the Sabbath, even in grinders made for grinding large quantities of peppercorns.  Although this is a large amount of work, and it is clear that most of the pepper will not be used on that day, Rabbi Eleazar nevertheless permits.  The Sages forbid this.  According to them, one may grind peppercorns only in small quantities with a mortar and pestle, since grinding more than this would be allowing one to prepare food on the festival for a week day, which is forbidden."

There is a halakhic concept in Judaism called “muktzeh”.  There are many forms of “muktzeh”;  I will explain the one form germane to these two mishnayoth.  [For more information you can look at the Steinsaltz reference guide].  Anything consumed on Shabbat or a festival has to have been available before the day begins.  This “availability” must be both physical and mental.  In other words the thing must have been physically available before the day began and the person must have known the day before that he might use the object during the Sabbath or festival.  Anything that is not available before the day began is considered “muktzeh”.  We will see some examples as we proceed.",

Beth Shammai holds that since the chicken was available on the eve of the festival, the egg is as well, for if the person had slaughtered the chicken he could have eaten the egg inside.",

According to Beth Shammai if one eats as a much as olive’s worth of yeast or a date’s worth of leavened food, he is liable for having transgressed the laws of Passover.  Beth Hillel holds that in both cases one who eats an olive’s worth is liable.  Note that smaller amounts are not permitted either.  A smaller amount is still forbidden but one who consumes a smaller amount has not transgressed the Biblical prohibition of eating yeast or leavened food on Passover."

There we saw that a dispute with regards to an egg born on a festival:  Beth Shammai permitted its consumption and Beth Hillel forbid.  In this mishnah we learn that there are two other similar instances where the two houses do not disagree.  They both hold that a beast that was born on a festival is permitted.  Although the beast was not born before the festival, and therefore might have been thought to be “muktzeh”, it in reality was available since if the mother had been slaughtered, the unborn young could have been eaten as well. The two houses also agree that a chicken hatched on the festival is forbidden.  Even though Beth Shammai permits an egg that is laid, the chicken that is hatched is different because it was still in its shell the day before.  Unlike the beast which was in its mother who could have been slaughtered and eaten, the chicken was not part of another animal that could have been eaten.",

But they agree that if he did slaughter he should dig with a pronged tool and cover up [the blood, and] that the ashes of a stove count as being prepared for the holiday.</b>  According to Leviticus 17:13, when one slaughters an undomesticated animal or any type of foul the blood must be poured out of the animal and covered with earth.  One who slaughters an undomesticated animal or foul on the festival has a problem.  Although it is permitted to slaughter if he doesn’t have any prepared earth to cover the blood, newly dug earth is “muktzeh” and cannot be used.  Nevertheless, Beth Shammai permits one to dig up new earth and cover the blood.  Beth Hillel says one cannot slaughter unless one has earth already prepared. However, they all agree that if he had already slaughtered the animal, even though Beth Hillel says he should not have done so without already prepared earth, he may still dig new earth to cover the blood.  This is because the principle of “muktzeh” is only rabbinically ordained and the obligation to cover the blood is Biblical.  When one has two competing commandments, one rabbinic and one Biblical, the latter takes precedence.  The two houses also agree that the ashes in the oven are considered prepared for the festival, in other words they are not “muktzeh”.  Since people used these ashes for different purposes, we can make the assumption that before the festival began he knew in his mind that he would use these ashes."

But Beth Hillel says: it is not counted as ownerless unless it is made ownerless also with respect to the rich, as in the year of release (.</b>  This section discusses the process whereby a person announces that something he owns is legally ownerless.  One of the important consequences of such an action is that if the item is a food product he need not separate tithes before he eats it.  In other words if a person has some produce he may pronounce it ownerless and eat from it without tithing.  Of course, he runs the risk of having other people come and take it from him.  According to Beth Shammai one could partially pronounce his produce ownerless by declaring that only the poor may partake of it.  Beth Hillel disagrees and says that pronouncing something legally ownerless must be complete. Beth Hillel learns this from the precedent set by the laws of the “year of release”, or the shmittah (seventh) year.  During the seventh year all produce grown in the fields is ownerless and anyone may enter any field and eat from it, both rich and poor.  Beth Hillel says that just as seventh year produce is ownerless and available to anyone, so too all produce must be available to all.",

One of them is the right to collect the harvested sheaves forgotten in a field (Deuteronomy 24:19).  The dispute here is over the definition of a forgotten sheaf.  According to Beth Shammai if all of the sheaves were one kav in volume and the forgotten sheaf was four times that size, and he left the large sheaf in the field, it is not considered forgotten.  The reason is that four separate sheaves that are left together are not considered to be forgotten.  In other words, if four separate sheaves are left in a field we can assume that the owner never came to collect them, and not that he came to collect them and left them behind.  Beth Shammai says that if one sheaf is the size of four sheaves of that field we can consider it to be four separate sheaves and it is not considered forgotten.  Beth Hillel holds that since it is really only one sheaf, we can assume that he did forget it, and hence it already belongs to the poor."

But they agree that if it was perforated and the dregs stopped it up, it is not liable to receive impurity.</b>  Leviticus 11:38 teaches that food cannot receive impurity unless it has come into contact with water.  The Rabbis taught that not only water but other liquids as well can cause food to become receptive to impurity.  However, if the owner of the food did not wish the liquid to touch his food the liquid does not cause the food to become receptive to impurity.  In this section of our mishnah Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel disagree with regards to the liquid that oozes out of olives that have been pickled in salt.  Everyone agrees that this liquid is not desired by the owner; all he wants are the edible olives.  However, according to Beth Hillel the owner must put a hole in the barrel to let the liquid seep out in order to make it clear that he does not want the liquid.  If he does not do so the olives will be made receptive to impurity by the liquid which oozes out of them.  Beth Shammai does not require one to put this hole.  According to them we can generally assume that a person does not want such liquids and therefore they do not cause food to become receptive to impurity. Both houses agree that if one put a hole in the barrel and then it was closed up by the dregs that the olives are not receptive to impurity.  Since he put a hole in the barrel he has made it clear that he does not want the liquids inside and therefore their contact with the olives do not cause the olives to receive impurity.",

[Anointing with oil was part of the bathing process].  If he enters the mikveh (ritual bath) to purify himself, according to Beth Shammai, he also purifies any remaining oil on his body.  Although oil is cannot generally be made pure through a mikveh, in this case the oil becomes pure by being part of his body, which does become pure.  Beth Hillel holds that if there is only enough oil remaining on his body to anoint a small limb, it is pure.  In this case we can say that the oil is not of significance in and of itself and therefore is part of the body.  However, if there is more than that, it is impure. If the oil was impure from the outset, and then the person became impure through another source of impurity (the oil itself cannot cause the person to become impure), and went into the mikveh, then both houses are stricter with regards to the purity of the oil remaining on his body.  According to Beth Shammai if only enough remains to anoint a small limb, it is pure.  If more remains it is impure. According to Beth Hillel if enough remains to moisten the hand that touches the oil, it is impure; if less, then it is pure.  Rabbi Judah teaches a different version of Beth Hillel’s words.

We will learn these laws more extensively when we learn Seder Nashim.  For now I will merely mention that kiddushin creates a stronger bond than secular engagement does in our day.  In order to separate from Jewish betrothal there is a need for a full divorce. One of the ways of contracting betrothal is for the man to give something of value to a woman.  Today this is usually performed with a ring, a custom not mentioned in the Mishnah or even in the Talmud.  According to Beth Shammai, the minimum amount that a man had to give a woman was a denar.   While it is hard to know how much a denar was worth at those times, it probably was not more than a day’s wages, and maybe even less.

Beth Hillel fears that they did have relations, and therefore she needs a new get if she wishes to marry someone else. The final clause limits this ruling of Beth Hillel to a couple that was already married.  Since they were already sexually familiar with each other, we suspect that they may have again had sexual relations while they were at the inn.  However, if the couple had been divorced before they were married, while they were still betrothed, there had not been sexual familiarity between them and therefore Beth Hillel does not suspect that they had relations while secluded.

When a woman’s husband dies without children she must either marry her brother-in-law or be released from marriage by him.  According to the laws of the Torah, this marriage does not require prior betrothal.  Rather it is consummated in one step:  sexual relations.

But Beth Hillel says: he should put away his wife with a get and halitzah, and the wife of his brother [he should put away] with halitzah.

In this mishnah there are three brothers, Reuven, Shimon and Levi.  Reuven and Shimon were married to Leah and Rachel who are sisters and Levi is unmarried.  When either Reuven and Shimon dies Levi performs maamar, betrothal in the case of levirate marriage, with one of the sisters.  At this point the other brother dies.  The other sister should according to the laws of levirate marriage, also marry Levi.  This is a problem because the other brother has already betrothed, although not married this woman’s sister.  It is also somewhat of a problem for Levi to consummate the marriage with the first widowed sister since her sister is also bound to Levi by her need for levirate marriage or halitzah.  Nevertheless, Beth Shammai rules that Levi may marry the first sister.  The second widowed sister does not need either halitzah or levirate marriage, since she is forbidden to Levi who is married to her sister.  In other words, according to Beth Shammai although Levi only performed “maamar” with the first sister, the bond created is strong enough to exempt the second sister from halitzah or levirate marriage to Levi. Beth Hillel disagrees.  According to them maamar is not as strong as full marriage.  Therefore Levi must perform two ceremonies in order to release the first widow:  1)  he must divorce her to untie the bond created by the maamar; 2)  he must perform halitzah to untie the bond created by her being his dead brother’s wife.  The second widow also requires halitzah. The mishnah ends with what must have been a popular saying, although not necessarily said strictly in this circumstance.

One who takes a vow to be a nazirite (see Numbers 6) is forbidden to do three things:  1)  cut his hair; 2) drink wine or any grape products; 3) become impure.  If a nazirite should become impure during his naziriteship, he must begin to count the days of his naziriteship again.\nAccording to the Rabbis one who takes a vow of naziriteship without specifying the length of the naziriteship is a nazirite for thirty days.  If he specifies more than thirty days than he is a nazirite for that specified period.  If he specifies less than thirty days, he is still a nazirite for thirty days.  Thirty days is the minimum period that one can be a nazirite.\nIf one took a vow of naziriteship outside the land of Israel, he will have trouble observing his vow, because the Rabbis ruled that land outside of Israel imparts impurity.  Since he is impure merely by being outside of Israel, he cannot truly keep his vow.  Nevertheless the Rabbis said that he must observe his naziriteship outside of Israel, and then later when he arrives in Israel, observe another naziriteship.  In our mishnah Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel disagree with regards to how long he must be a nazirite when he arrives in Israel.",

Since the impurity of land outside of Israel is only of Rabbinic (derabanan) ordinance and is not of the higher Toraitic status (deoraitta), Beth Shammai is lenient.  Although his original vow was of greater length, he need observe only thirty days, the minimum length of naziriteship, when he arrives in the Holy Land. Beth Hillel holds that he must observe the full length of his original naziriteship.",

But Beth Hillel says: a man is hollow, and the upper side causes the impurity to pass over.</b> This mishnah, which is also found in tractate Ohalot 11:3, deals with a situation explained there in mishnah two.  The situation is that there is a portico, a semi-covered courtyard, which is surrounded by pillars and on one side is a house.  The portico is covered but the walls are open in three directions.  This roof would normally cause tent impurity to be imparted to anything under the roof.  In other words, if there was a source of impurity (such as a dead body) under the roof and a live person, or vessels under the same roof, the live person and vessels would be impure.  The previous mishnah to our mishnah in Ohalot deals with a case where there is a crack in the roof.  The impurity does not pass from one side of the crack to the other.  Therefore if there is a dead body on one side and vessels on another, the vessels are not impure. The dispute between Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel is about a case when a person was lying on the ground, directly under the crack.  According to Beth Shammai, this person does not bridge the crack in the roof above, and the vessels which are on the opposite side remain pure.  Beth Hillel holds that since the body of a person is considered to be hollow, the roof of his abdomen bridges the gap created by the crack and brings the impurity over to the other side.",

The bird is forbidden, but we need to know is the egg still part of the bird, in which case it too is forbidden, or is it a separate entity, in which case it is permitted.  According to Beth Shammai, if this egg is fully-formed such that it is similar to eggs sold in the market, it is a separate entity and is permitted.  Beth Hillel states that the egg is forbidden in any case.  The mishnah notes that the two houses agree in the case of an egg found in a “trefah” that it is forbidden.  A “trefah” is an animal suffering from a wound or illness that will cause it to die within 12 months.  Since the egg grew in an animal that was definitely going to be forbidden to eat, even if it was slaughtered properly, the egg is forbidden.  The egg which was found in the carcass of the dead bird, had the potential to be a kosher egg, and therefore, according to Beth Shammai, if the egg was fully formed, it is permitted to eat.",

According to Rabbinic law, fluids flowing from gentiles are impure.  However, Beth Shammai argues that this is only with regards to their spit and urine, fluids which are always present.  The decree of the Rabbis that their fluids are impure does not apply to their blood flows.  With regards to the gonorrheal Jewish woman, she is normally impure.

According to Beth Shammai this prohibition is with regards to meat (cow, lamb, sheep) only.  Since eating fowl together with dairy is not forbidden according to the Torah, as is eating milk and meat, but rather fowl and dairy are forbidden only by Rabbinic law, the Rabbis were not so strict as to prevent one from putting them together on the same table.

According to the Talmud the reason is that people used to put the scrolls into arks with terumah food, reasoning that both were holy.  Mice would come to eat the food and they would destroy the scrolls.  By decreeing that the scrolls would defile the terumah, people stopped this practice. There are several debates in the Mishnah about what books are included in the Biblical canon such that they defile the hands.  According to Beth Shammai, Ecclesiastes (Koheleth) does not defile the hands.  This is probably due to the deeply pessimistic, bordering on heretical, tone of the book.  At times the author of the book has at least serious doubts about whether or not the performance of good deeds brings with it rewards, a doctrine held as true by the Rabbis.  Beth Hillel includes it in the Biblical canon probably for two reasons:  1)  it was, according to tradition, written by King Solomon; 2)  the last verse of the book exhorts the reader to listen to God’s word and to do good, a message that was certainly acceptable to the Rabbis.",

After this time she is supposed to go to the mikveh (ritual bath) and she will be pure.  Any blood that flows after this time is pure (up to 33 days for a boy and 66 days for a girl). Our mishnah discusses a woman who had not gone to the mikveh after the initial seven or 14 day period. According to Beth Shammai the blood of this woman is not totally impure.  Rather it is impure only when it is wet, like her spittle and urine.  When dry the blood is pure. Beth Hillel disagrees and holds that it is impure whether wet or dry. The two Houses agree that if the woman was a “zavah”, a woman with an unnatural discharge (such as gonorrhea) at the time of childbirth, that her blood remains impure both when wet and when dry.  A “zavah” must count seven clean days (free from any blood) for her to be able to go to the mikveh and become pure.

If Reuven and Shimon die without children, Rachel and Leah need to perform halitzah or enter into levirate marriage with either Levi and Judah.  However, they cannot both be married to the same brother, since a man cannot marry two sisters.  Since each sister is “tied” to each brother (by her need to perform halitzah or be married), the best thing to do is for each to perform halitzah, the release from levirate marriage.  From here we learn that it is forbidden for a man to marry the sister of a woman who is tied to him, in a similar way that it is forbidden for a man to marry two sisters. According to Beth Shammai, if, even though it is forbidden to do so, Levi and/or Judah married Rachel or Leah, they are not forced to divorce them.  According to Beth Shammai the law that says that they must perform “halitzah” is only “lekhathilah”, meaning ab initio.  One should not do marry these sisters, but if one did the action is valid.  According to Beth Hillel, this marriage is forbidden even “bediavad”, meaning even after it was done, it remains forbidden, and they are forced to divorce them.

If some wool falls off while it is alive and someone puts it away for safekeeping, but does not use it, and then the animal is slaughtered to be eaten (which is permitted since it has a flaw) Akavia permits this wool to be used.

This would exclude a woman who converted or a Canaanite slave who was freed (by being freed a Canaanite slave becomes a Jew).  The Sages disagree and state that these women do drink.  Although they were not born as Israelites, since they are currently full Jews they have the same ability and liability to drink the “bitter waters” if they are accused of adultery. The Sages support their opinion that the freed slave drinks by mentioning the precedent of Karkemith, a freed slave, who was given the “bitter waters” by Shemaiah and Avtalion, two early Sages.  Akavia disagrees and states that they didn’t give her the real bitter waters, but rather a simulated version.  The reason that they didn’t give her the real bitter waters is that the in the process of making the bitter waters God’s holy name is written on a scroll and then erased into the water, something which under normal circumstances is forbidden.

I stood fast by the tradition which I heard, and they stood fast by the tradition which they heard. But you have heard [my tradition] from the mouth of a single individual and [their tradition] from the mouth of the many.  It is better to leave the opinion of the single individual and to hold by the opinion of the many.”</b>  As Akavia is about to die, he offers some conciliation to the Sages, by telling his son to retract the statements to which he had previously clung.  His son is perplexed by this request of Akavia.  After all, Akavia was willing to be put into permanent excommunication, to lose his entire standing in the Rabbinic community, in order to stand up for the statements which he had made.  Why now was he all of a sudden willing to change his mind? Akavia’s answer returns us to the principle which we had learned in chapter one, mishnah five.  When there is a dispute between many Sages on one side and a singular Sage on the other, the halakhah is like the many.  Here Akavia teaches that a tradition that was learned from many Sages is stronger and more accepted as normative halakhah than a tradition that was learned from a singular Sage.  His son had learned them only from him, and therefore their weight was less than the rulings of the Sages, who in the time of Akavia were considered the many.",

Evidently, although Akavia had been put in excommunication, he retained some ties with other Sages. Akavia’s final words teach a lesson to all children of leaders. Although Akavia’s son was the child of a great teacher, one who was almost appointed to be the head of the court, the son will have to earn his own way into a position of leadership. If he is worthy, he will have the opportunity to achieve high positions as a Rabbi; if he is unworthy, a good word from his father will not help him.",
                    "<b>Questions for Further Thought:</b><br>• According to Akavia, what gives a halakhah its authority?  In other words, why did he not retract the things which he had stated?  Did he believe that these were the necessarily “true” statements?<br>• As a piece of literature, what is the function of the final piece of the story?  Why does this story end with Akavia’s telling his son that his own merits are what will earn him status in the world?  Has Akavia somehow changed due to his excommunication?"

                    "<b>Rabbi Judah ben Bava testified concerning five things:<br>That women who are minors are made to declare an annulment of their marriage;</b>  Only a father has the right to marry off his daughter while she is a minor (under 12 ½) and have the marriage considered Biblically valid.  If the father is not alive, the mother or brother can marry off the daughter while she is a minor, but the marriage is only Rabbinically valid.  Being so, she has a right to refuse the marriage when she reaches majority.  If she does so the marriage is annulled and is considered as having never been.  This refusal is called “meun”.  Occasionally, if it was in the best interests of all parties, the Rabbis instructed the daughter to refuse the marriage.  Such an occasion could occur in the following instance. Two brothers, Reuven and Shimon, were married to two sisters who had no father, Leah who was of majority age and therefore arranged her own marriage (her marriage is Biblically valid) and Rachel, whose marriage was arranged by her mother or brother (her marriage is only Rabbinically valid).  If Leah’s husband, Reuven, dies she must have levirate marriage with Shimon, Rachel’s husband.  The problem is that Rachel’s marriage to Shimon is now impossible because Leah’s tie to Shimon which is Biblical, supersedes Rachel’s marriage which is only Rabbinic.  In order to allow Leah to have levirate marriage with Shimon, the Rabbis teach Rachel to refuse their marriage, thereby annulling it.",

However, one exception to this rule is the case of a woman whose husband may have died. If she cannot ascertain his death, she cannot remarry, which will leave her an “agunah” a woman who cannot marry.  In order to prevent this difficult situation for the widow the Rabbis were lenient and allowed testimony based on only one witness.",

Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Nehunia state that it is impure.  Rabbi Eliezer states that it is pure, and that the only type of “separated limb” which is impure is one that has been separated from a living body.<br>Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Nehunya respond with a classic type of Talmudic argumentation, called a “kal vehomer”.  Generally a corpse is considered the greatest source of impurity, whereas a living body is often not a source of impurity at all.  [It is not in and of itself impure; it only becomes impure if it contracts it somehow.]  If a limb separated from a living body is impure, even though the living body itself is pure, all the more so a limb separated from a corpse is impure, since the corpse itself is impure.<br>Rabbi Eliezer’s response is very typical of Rabbi Eliezer.  He states that although Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Nehunya’s reasoning may be good reasoning, the tradition that he received from his teachers was only that a limb separated from a living body was impure.  Even though there may be logic in extending this principle to include limbs from corpses, Rabbi Eliezer does not believe that it is the sage’s responsibility to add on to received traditions.  Rabbi Eliezer is known as an arch-traditionalist; in another place he claims never to have stated anything that he did not hear from his teachers.  Here we see classic example of Rabbi Eliezer sticking to his received tradition, in the face of a good argument to extend that tradition.<br>The final section of the mishnah contains a logical refutation of Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Nehunya’s kal vehomer argument.  In order to refute a kal vehomer argument one must point out that one side is not always more stringent than the other side.  In other words, if the kal vehomer was based on a stable, predictable relationship between two things, the refutation points out that this relationship is not so predictable. In this case Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Nehunya had pointed out that a corpse is more impure than a living body, and therefore if something that comes from a living body is impure, all the more so the same thing that comes from a corpse will be impure.  The refutation points out that with regards to some laws, the living body is a greater source of impurity than the corpse.  A zav (a person with an unusual genital discharge) causes anything on which he sits or lies to become impure and able to transmit impurity to people or clothing.  He also causes anything above him to become impure and able to transmit impurity to food and liquids.  The corpse does not have such a strong ability to impart impurity.  Since in some ways the living body can have a stronger impurity than the corpse, one cannot make the kal vehomer argument that Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Nehunya tried to make."

The jar itself cannot receive impurity, for it is made out of stone which can never become impure.  If the jar is placed over an impure creeping thing, the ashes inside the jar are impure, even though the jar itself remains pure.  This is due to an interpretation of Numbers 19:9 which states, “A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the cow and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place.”  Since these ashes were not put in a “clean place”, they become impure.

The reason is that if the halakhah were to allow the owner to bring it as a peace-offering he would have incentive to delay bringing the mother , who has already been declared a peace-offering, to the Temple.  The owner might wait until she gives birth, perhaps several times, in order that he would be able to bring more peace-offerings (after all he benefits as well by having more meat to eat).

This extra month is called Adar Bet (second Adar).  During the time of the Mishnah they did not have a fixed calendar.

Usually a person who lacks intelligence, such a deaf-mute, minor or insane person, cannot enter into legally binding contracts, because they don’t understand their ramifications.  However, as Rabbi Nehunia testifies, a deaf-mute can be divorced.  (She was married off by her father).  The reason is that divorce is not dependent upon the woman’s acquiescence; she can be divorced against her will.  Since her will is irrelevant, even one who lacks awareness can be divorced.  Although this might sound harsh, as if the Rabbis are going out of their way to allow a deaf-mute to be divorced, it may have also worked in her benefit.

According to Rabbi Shimon ben Bathyra if an impure person touches some of these ashes, all of the ashes that are in the same pile have become impure.  Even though each ash is its own distinct object and they are not attached to each other, one who touches some, defiles it all.

This includes flour, incense, frankincense and coals, all of which are used on the altar in the Temple.  If these are touched even by a “tevul yom”, someone who as already immersed himself in a mikveh to become clean but the sun has not yet set, will make them impure.  Note that the reason that Rabbi Akiva mentions specifically the “tevul yom” is that the Saducees and other Jewish sects (including the Dead Sea sect) held that a “tevul yom” was pure.

Therefore, if she is not married according to the Torah, when can she eat terumah, a right normally reserved for those married deoraita?

One explanation given is that according to the Torah one who touches a dead body is impure for seven days and one who touches this person is only impure for one day.  However, the Rabbis were stricter and ruled that also one who touches a person who has touched a dead body is impure for seven days.  Rabbi Yose disagreed with this ruling.  When he states that one who touches a dead body is impure for seven days, he excludes one who touches a person who has touched a dead body.  Another possibility is that Rabbi Yose ruled that one who definitely touched a dead body is impure, but one who may or may not have done so is not impure. An intriguing possibility that Albeck brings up is that this ruling of Rabbi Yose is against the Essenes, a Jewish sect that existed towards the end of the Second Temple period.  The Essenes, who are likely the same group that occupied the Dead Sea settlement where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found, were extremely strict in matters of purity and impurity.

The reason why Rabbi Akiva repeats the testimony is explained in the last mishnah of Yevamoth.

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn this mishnah both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua give testimony about the Temple and issues of its holiness.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer said:   I have heard that when they were building the Temple [complex] they made curtains for the Temple and curtains for the Temple-courts; but in the case of the Temple they built from the outside, and in the case of the Temple-court they built from the inside.</b>  This section discusses the building of the walls of the Temple.  Rabbi Eliezer states that when they built the Second Temple and the surrounding courtyards they first demarcated the areas by hanging curtains.  When it came to building the Temple itself they built the walls from the outside of the curtains.  This way they did not actually see the Temple and become distracted by its splendor and not be able to build properly.  Another possible reason is to prevent unnecessary infringement upon the Temple confines.  However, when it came to the courtyard they built the walls from within the curtains.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Joshua said: I have heard that sacrifices may be offered even though there is no Temple, and that the most holy sacrifices may be eaten even though there are no curtains, and the less holy sacrifices and second tithes even though there is no wall [around Jerusalem];  because the first sanctification sanctified both for its own time and for the time to come.</b>  Rabbi Joshua claims that although the Second Temple in Jerusalem has been destroyed, and the walls of the Temple, its courtyards and Jerusalem have been torn down, it is still, at least theoretically possible to offer sacrifices and to eat them in the places that they would have been eaten while the Temple stood.  In other words even though there is no wall surrounding the Temple, the priests can still eat the sacrifices that had to be consumed within the Temple precents and even though there are no walls to Jerusalem, the people can still eat the sacrifices and second tithes that had to be consumed within Jerusalem.  This is because when the Temple mount was sanctified originally when the First Temple was built by Solomon the area was sanctified permanently, and the sanctity of the place continues to exist even though the Temple no longer stands. Historians have paid careful attention to this statement by Rabbi Joshua, asking the question, did the Jews continue to offer sacrifices after the destruction of the Temple in 70 C.E.?  Although there is some evidence that the Jews did continue to do so, the overwhelming evidence is that they did not.  Rabbi Joshua’s claim is likely to be more theoretical/ideological than realistic.  Certainly after the Bar Kochba rebellion in 135 C.E., when hopes of restoring the Temple were crushed, the Jews simply did not have the ability to offer sacrifices on the Temple mount.  Nowadays, although Jews do have sovereignty over the Temple mount, few believe that we may return to offering sacrifices, although some fringe groups do and have attempted to do so.",

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe final mishnah of Eduyoth discusses what Elijah, who according to the end of Malachi, will reappear at the end of time, will do.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Joshua said: I have received a tradition from Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, who heard it from his teacher, and his teacher [heard it] from his teacher, as a halakhah [given] to Moses from Sinai, that Elijah will not come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near, but to put away those brought near by force and to bring near those put away by force. The family of Beth Tzriphah was on the other side of the Jordan and Ben Zion put it away by force; and yet another family was there, and Ben Zion brought it near by force. It is such as these that Elijah will come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near.</b>  Rabbi Joshua says that Rabban Yohanan ben Zakai had a tradition that can be traced all the way back to Moses who received it at Sinai, that when Elijah the prophet reappears in Messianic time, he will not clarify which families are clean, meaning they have not intermarried with forbidden relationships, nor will he clarify the opposite.  He will neither put away the unclean families nor draw near the clean families.  All that he will do is bring near the families who were forcibly and illegitimately put away and put away the families that were forcibly and illegitimately brought near.  In other words, decisions that humans had made as to which families were clean and which were not, and were made in a legal fashion without coercion, will be accepted by Elijah, even if he knows that they were wrong.  However, actions which were enacted by force and not consented to by the law-abiding sections of society will be corrected. A note about “a law from Moses on Sinai”.  The Rambam points out that Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai did not actually have a tradition that Moses said these very words.  Rather this is how the tradition understood Deuteronomy 30:3-4, which states that if you are scattered to the four corners of the earth, God will bring you back.  This is understood to mean that if a family was illegitimately not allowed to intermarry with other Jewish families, Elijah would redeem the situation. The mishnah now proceeds to mention one family that had been put away by force, meaning that this person Ben Zion, forcibly pronounced them unclean and made the rest of society abide by his will.  So too, Ben Zion, forcibly pronounced another family clean, and made society abide by his will.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah says: to bring near, but not to put away.</b>  Rabbi Judah claims that Elijah will bring near but he will not put away.  This is probably similar to the words of the Sages at the end of the mishnah.  Elijah does not come to cause pain by putting some families away.  The only problem that he will rectify is families who should be brought near, not those who should be put away.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Shimon says: to conciliate disputes.</b>  Rabbi Shimon holds that when Elijah will come he will settle all the disputes between the Rabbis.",
                    "<b>And the Sages say: neither to put away nor to bring near, but to make peace in the world, for it is said,  “Behold I send to you Elijah the prophet”, etc., “and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers” (Malachi 3:23-2.</b>  The Sages hold that when Elijah comes it will only be to bring peace to the world.  However, we should notice what peace means in this mishnah:  a state of familial harmony.  Peace doesn’t only mean the absence of warfare, rather it is more accurately interpreted as societal well-being, a reconciliation of parents with children.  The Sages’ opinion is supported by the final verses of the book of Malachi, the very verses that teach that the Messianic age will be preceded by Elijah.",
                    "<b>Questions for Further Thought:</b><br>• How does Rabbi Shimon’s opinion compare with the other opinions in the mishnah?  What does he hold about Godly intervention in human affairs?Congratulations!  We have finished Eduyoth.By now, for those of you who have been learning since the beginning of the Seder, you have grown accustomed to this point, where we thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives.However, I believe in this case we should give pause and offer an even greater hearty Yasher Koach (congratulations).  This tractate is certainly one of the more difficult tractates, one which includes an extremely wide variety of topics.  Oftentimes each mishnah or even each section of each mishnah contained a new topic. This has made the tractate difficult to follow.  For those of you who nevertheless stuck it out, Yasher Koach.  For those of you who gave up, do not despair.  The remaining three tractates of Nezikin are much simpler.  Tomorrow we begin to learn Tractate Avodah Zarah."
