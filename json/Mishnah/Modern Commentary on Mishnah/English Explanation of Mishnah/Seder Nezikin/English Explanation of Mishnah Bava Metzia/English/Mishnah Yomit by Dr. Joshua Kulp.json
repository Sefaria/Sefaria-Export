When his friend picked it up he claimed it for himself.  According to the mishnah the person who picked it up can claim title to the object.  If, however, the person picked it up and then gave it to his fellow, he cannot subsequently claim title.  The person’s claim to ownership must come at the same time that he actually has possession of the object and not after he has already given it to someone else. unable to leave the field;  3)  the owner of the field makes a claim of acquisition over the animal.",

In the previous mishnah we learned that merely a person’s saying that he wished to take the object does not cause it to belong to him.  In our mishnah we learn that even physically making a move to get it is also insufficient.  The lost object is not his until he actually takes possession.",

In such a case the animal is acquired not by physical possession by the claimant but by the animal being on his field.  If the person sees people running after a lost object in his field and that lost object cannot move off his field he can acquire it by saying that his field acquires it.  If, however, the animal can run or fly and therefore is not “stuck” on the person’s field, the field cannot acquire the animal.   In other words in order for the field to acquire the animal on behalf of its owner three conditions must be fulfilled:  1)  other people have not claimed it (in the mishnah others are running after it but have not reached it; 2)  the animal is physically unable to leave the field;  3)  the owner of the field makes a claim of acquisition over the animal.",

In other words in return for his financial support, they must give him any of their earnings.  A Canaanite (i.e. non-Jewish) slave or female slave is totally owned by their owner.  They do not have the ability to own possessions and therefore anything they find belongs to their master.  Finally, a married woman who is receiving financial support from her husband, gives him in return any of her earnings, including found objects.  Note, that the relationship between a father and his children and a husband and his wife is one in which the latter are guaranteed support, even if they earn nothing.  In such a familial structure allowing the child or wife to keep found objects while still receiving financial support from their father/husband may cause him to resent them, ultimately to their detriment.",

What they find belongs to them.  Also, a Hebrew slave is treated in the Mishnah to be more similar to a hired worker who can own his own possession.  Anything the slave finds therefore, belongs to him/her.  Finally, a divorced woman does not owe her husband any financial gains she accrues after the divorce.  This is true even if he has not paid her ketubah, meaning the divorce settlement.  In such a case he is still obligated to provide her with food, clothing and shelter.  Nevertheless, since he divorced her, he does not receive any object she might find.",

But if they did not record a lien on the [debtor’s] property he may return them, since the court would not exact payment from the property, according to Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say:  “In either case he should not return them, since [in either case] the court would exact payment from the property.”</b> Generally, when a debtor pays back his debt he would take the document and tear it up, so that the creditor could not collect it again.  If one found a debt document, one could therefore assume that it came from the creditor.  However, according to our mishnah in most circumstances one should not return it to the creditor.  Our mishnah is concerned concerned that the debtor and creditor colluded to defraud a third party.  We will explain. If the debtor had written a lien on his property in the document the creditor could take from this property if the debtor defaulted.  For example let us say that Reuven loaned Shimon 1000 dollars and Shimon put a lien over all his property.  After the loan Shimon sold his property to Levi and then Shimon lost all of his money (probably in high tech stocks!).  Reuven can now collect his debt from the property sold to Levi.  Our mishnah is concerned that Reuven might make a deal with Shimon for Shimon to pay back, let’s say 500 dollars, and then to deny that he paid back anything and then Reuven would collect Shimon’s sold property from Levi.  Lest such collusion had been committed one should not return debt documents that have written in them liens.  According to Rabbi Meir, if no lien was written in the document there is nothing to fear and one may return it to the creditor.  According to the Sages all loans done through documents imply a lien on the debtor’s property, whether or not this is written specifically in the document.  Therefore no debt documents may be returned to the creditor.",

These documents would normally be kept by the recipient.  If one of these was found one might have expected to return it to the recipient, i.e. the wife, slave, etc.  However, the mishnah states that they should not be returned.  Since it is possible that the writer wrote the document and subsequently changed his mind and did not give the document, we cannot be sure that the recipient lost it.",

In such a case we need not fear that the court wrote the document and then did not fulfill what was stated in it, as we feared with regards to the documents mentioned in the previous mishnah.  Therefore they can be returned to those named in the documents.  A “letter of evaluation” is an evaluation of a person’s property should it need to be sold to pay off his debts.  A “letter of sustenance” is permission given to a wife to sell her husband’s property should he not properly provide her with food (or other financial obligations).  “Documents of halitzah” are documents that testify to a man’s having declared that he will not perform the levirate marriage (see Deuteronomy 25:5-10).  “Documents of refusal” are documents that testify that a woman whose mother or brother (but not father) arranged her marriage when she was a minor refused the marriage when she became an adult.

According to Exodus 23:4 and Deuteronomy 22:1-4, a person has an obligation to return lost objects to their owner.  The mishnah is concerned with which objects are included in this obligation and with the question of the owner claiming his object by identifying it.",
                    "Since the Torah states that a person must return lost objects, it is necessary to decide which lost objects must be returned.  A society could not operate if every lost object had to be returned.  Imagine if every time you found a pen, or a coin or some other small not valuable item, you had to spend time trying to find the owners.  Furthermore, there are some lost items which could not be identified by their owner as belonging to them, such as money or mass produced merchandise.   If a person should lose one of these types of things, meaning either something that cannot be identified as his or something of little value, he does not expect to ever have it returned.  Such a situation is called in Hebrew “yeush” despair, and the legal consequence is that the finder may keep the lost object.",

Rabbi Judah says:  “Anything which has in it something unusual, must be proclaimed.  How is this so?  If he found a fig cake with a potsherd in it or a loaf with coins in it [he must proclaim them].” Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:  “New merchandise need not be proclaimed.”</b>  Section one lists objects that are either not identifiable as belonging to a specific person, or of little value.  We will learn the opposites of these items, meaning things that are of value and identifiable in the following mishnah.  Therefore we will explain them more fully later on. According to Rabbi Judah, if there was a unidentifiable object which had something unusual about it, he must proclaim it.  (We will learn the process of proclaiming a lost object later in the chapter.)  For instance, a normal loaf of bread could not be identified as belonging to a certain person, and therefore the finder may keep it.  If, however, there was money in the bread, the owner could identify it, and therefore the finder must proclaim it. According to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, mass produced merchandise need not be proclaimed.  This would be something akin to tupperware in our day.  Certainly before the item has been used its owner would not be able to give any special identification marks.  Therefore the finder may keep it."

However, in the private domain they can be identified by the place where they were found. 4) Bakers loaves are of standard size and shape and therefore cannot be identified.

Finally, we will learn what a person must do with the object if no one claims it.",
                    "<b>A garment was also included amongst all these things (which one must proclaim, listed in Deut. 22:3). Why was it mentioned separately? To compare [other things] to it:  to teach you just as a garment is distinct in that it has special marks and it has those who claim it, so too everything that has special marks and those who claim it must be proclaimed.</b> Deuteronomy 22:1-2 begin with a general command to return lost items. The specific item mentioned is an ox or a sheep.  Verse 3 continues (JPS translation):  “You shall do the same with his ass; you shall do the same with his garment; and so too shall you do with anything that your fellow loses and you find; you must not remain indifferent.”  If we read the verse carefully, we will notice that it is superfluous.  First the Torah mentions a lost ass and garment and then everything else.  The question which our mishnah asks is why should garment be mentioned separately.  The answer is that a garment is paradigmatic for which types of items must be proclaimed.  First of all a garment has distinctive marks on it by which its owner could identify it.  This is still generally true today but would have been especially true in Mishnaic times when everything was sewn by hand.  Second of all, a garment has people who would claim it.  It is a valuable enough item that someone who lost it will almost always want it back.  Any item which does not fit these two categories, distinctive and of a certain, minimal value, need not be returned.",

Rabbi Judah’s suggestion reflects a law that would have been most applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem stood.  When the Temple stood people would come to Jerusalem to proclaim and claim there lost items, no matter where they were lost.  It was assumed that a person would come on at least one of the three Pilgrimage Festivals, Sukkot, Pesach and Shavuoth.  Therefore the item should be proclaimed for these three festivals.

If the claimant has a reputation for being a deceiver, then even if he states the distinctive marks, the item shouldn’t be given to him.  This is learned through a pun on a word in Deut. 22:2.  The verse states that the item should remain with the finder until the person who lost it claims it.  The Hebrew word for claim, doresh, can also mean to interrogate.  The Mishnah then switches the order of the verse.  Instead of the person who lost the item claiming it from the finder, the finder interrogates the person who lost the item, to find out whether he is known to be a deceiver.<br>Section two:  There are two possibilities for dealing with an unclaimed item.  If it is something that can be used and the worth of its use will compensate for its upkeep, then it may be used.  For instance, a lost cow may be milked to pay for its food.  After all, it is unfair to the finder that he should have to pay for the upkeep without receiving compensation.  Such a system would indeed discourage people from protecting other people’s lost items.<br>If the lost item could not work to pay for its feed than it should be sold.  The mishnah learns this from the verse which demands that he return the item to the person who lost it.  If the item did not earn money and just decreased in value, the finder would not be doing any favors to the loser by holding on to it.  For instance if one were to find an expensive cake, that had identifying marks on it.  Obviously one couldn’t  save the cake for a long period of time or it would eventually be worthless.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the loser for the finder to sell and then return the value.<br>According to Rabbi Tarfon, the money from this sale may be used by the finder, and therefore if it is lost or stolen he is responsible to restore it.  Since he gets the benefit of its use, he has extra responsibility over the item.  According to Rabbi Akiva, the money may not be used.  Since he doesn’t get the benefit of the use of the money, he is not responsible if it is lost."

Each guardian has a different level of liability should the object be lost, damaged or die (if it was an animal).  The Torah discusses guardians in Exodus 22:6-14.<br>1) The borrower.  He is responsible to return the object at its original value to the owner no matter what happens to it.  For instance should a person borrow a cow and the cow die even a natural death he would be obligated to give the owner the value of the live cow.<br>2) The renter.  If the animal should be damaged or taken captive or die while he was renting it he may take an oath that he was not negligent with the animal and he is then exempt from paying back the value of the animal.  If the animal should be stolen or lost he must repay the value of the animal.<br>3) The paid guardian, i.e. someone who is paid to watch the animal or object.  His liability is the same as the renter’s.<br>4) The unpaid guardian.  No matter what happens to the animal or object he may take an oath that he was not negligent in its care and then be exempt from paying.<br>As you will notice, the greater the benefit the greater the liability.  A borrower, who uses the object and does not pay for the use only benefits.  Therefore his liability is greatest.  An unpaid guardian, who is not allowed to use the object, does not benefit at all.  Therefore his liability is minimal.  A renter gets to use the object but he pays for it.  A paid guardian may not use the object but he gets paid for watching over it.  Therefore renters and unpaid guardians have middle level liability.<br>These laws are a necessary background to many of the rules in our chapter and they will be dealt with at greater length in chapter eight.<br>Our mishnah deals with an object that is stolen or lost while under the watch of an unpaid guardian.<br>The scenario in the first half of the mishnah is as follows:  a man leaves an animal or utensils with his friend who is an unpaid guardian.  The animal or utensils are stolen by a thief.  When the owner asks for them in return the unpaid guardian elects to repay the value instead of taking an oath.  Assumedly he preferred to pay the value rather than take an oath lest the oath be a false oath.  When the thief is found the thief must make twofold restitution if the animal was still alive and in his possession or fourfold or fivefold restitution if he had sold or slaughtered the animal (see chapter seven of Bava Kamma).  The question our mishnah asks is who receives the payment.  After all someone is going to benefit by receiving up to five times the value of the animal.  In this scenario the guardian receives the money and the extra money as well.  Since he already repaid the owner, it is as if he acquired the animal and all subsequent benefits that would come from the animal.<br>The difference in the second half of the mishnah is that the unpaid guardian took an oath and did not repay the owner.

The importance of this halacha is that when the transaction is final neither side may retract the sale.  For instance if an animal is sold and then dies before the seller can bring it to the buyer it is important to know if the sale was final.  If the sale was final then the buyer’s animal died. If it was not final than the seller’s animal died.  The general rule that is important to note in the outset is that the transfer of money does not cause the acquisition to be final.  In other words if Reuven gave Shimon 100 zuz for his cow the cow does not belong to Reuven until he takes possession of it (this can be done in various ways).<br>As explained in the introduction, money does not acquire movable property, but the transfer of movable property does obligate the buyer to give the money.  Our mishnah defines what money is in relation to movable property.  To understand this mishnah one must keep in mind that in those times coins were based on their weight in silver and the authority of the government who had minted the coin.  Most coins were made of silver but there were gold and copper coins as well.  Silver coins were more easily accepted in the marketplace than gold or copper coins.  Section one teaches that gold is “movable property” in relation to silver which is “money”.  Therefore if the owner of the silver takes the gold from its owner he is obligated to give him the silver, even if he were to change his mind.  If, however, the owner of the silver gave the silver to the owner of the gold, the sale is not final and the owner of the gold may still retract the exchange.<br>The remainder of the mishnah similarly defines property vis a vis money.  Copper is “property” compared to silver.  Bad, worn out and unminted coins do not fall into the category of “money” but are rather closer on the spectrum to being “movable property”.  Finally, if two pieces of movable property are being exchanged, the acceptance of one creates an obligation for the other to be given as well.<br>Examples relevant to this mishnah will be given in the next mishnah.<br> What might be a possible connection between those of the generations of the Flood and the Dispersion and those who don’t keep their word?"

Leviticus 25:35-37 states (JPS translation):  “If your kinsman, being in straits, comes under your authority, and you hold him as though a resident alien, let him live by your side.  Do not exact from him advance (neshech) or accrued interest (tarbit), but fear your God.  Let him live by your side as a your kinsman.  Do not lend him your money at advance interest (neshech), or give him your food at accrued interest (tarbit).”\nOur mishnah deals with the Rabbinic definitions of “neshech” and “tarbit”.",

This is a simple form of loaning with interest, where a person gives another person a loan of either money or goods and expects to get back more in return.  The mishnah understands that the Biblical word “neshech” derives from the word “noshech” which means to bite.  Interest “bites” because the creditor bites off from the debtor more than he gave.",

(1) [If] one bought wheat at a golden dinars [=25 silver dinars] for a kor when such was the market price, and then wheat rose to thirty [silver] dinars [per kor]. (2) [If] he said to him, “Give me my wheat since I would sell it and buy wine with the proceeds” and the other said, “Let your wheat be reckoned with me at thirty dinars and you now have a claim on me for wine [to that value], although the creditor has no wine.</b>  Section two defines the word “tarbit”.  This situation is more complicated.  Reuven buys from Shimon wheat at 25 dinars (=one silver dinars) per kor (a unit of volume) which was the market price of wheat.  Shimon does not immediately provide the wheat but rather will provide it at a later time.  After the sale the market price of wheat rises to 30 dinars.  Reuven requests from Shimon his wheat so that he can sell the wheat and buy wine.  Reuven is allowed to purchase the wheat at the lower price since he bought it at what was at the time market value.  Shimon says to Reuven that he will sell him wine in return for the wheat that he owes him.  In other words Shimon promises to provide Reuven with 30 dinars worth of wine, since that is the current value of the wheat.  If Shimon does not currently have this wine in his possession this is forbidden.  The reason is that if the price of wine goes up Reuven will have in effect loaned Shimon 30 dinars (the amount of wheat that Shimon owes Reuven) and when he gets the wine that has gone up in price he will receive back more than he loaned.  If Shimon had had the wine at the time when he said this to Reuven it would have been permitted, since by trading his wheat for wine, the wine would be in Reuven’s possession when it rose in price.  The problem is that if Shimon doesn’t own the wine he is in essence borrowing Reuven’s money.  If the price of wine should rise Shimon will end up returning interest to Reuven."

Usually interest is defined as extra money returned to the creditor in return for the loan.  However, as our mishnah points out, interest can come in other forms of benefit as well, such as free or reduced rent.  A borrower, therefore, may not allow his creditor to rent a house for free or for a reduced rate.",

However, if he sold him his field, and said to him, “If you pay me now it is yours for 1,000 zuz, but if you pay me at the time of threshing it will be 1,200 zuz”, it is forbidden.</b>  A renter may increase the rent-charge in return for not receiving the rent up front but a seller may not increase the price of a sale in return for a delayed payment.  The mishnah now explains this principle.  With regards to rent, the owner of the courtyard may say to the person renting the courtyard that he can either pay in advance 10 selas for the entire year or a monthly rate of one sela (12 selas per year) collected at the end of each month.  This is not considered interest in return for delaying the payment.  Since rent is reckoned on a monthly basis to be paid at the end of each month, each month of rental is considered individually, which is a permitted rental arrangement.  When the owner said that he would rent it for 10 selas for the whole year he was only offering a discount which is permitted. However, a person cannot sell an item and state one price for paying immediately and a larger price for receiving the money later.  This is considered interest.  For instance if Reuven sells a field worth 1,000 and tells Shimon that if he pays later he must pay 1,200, it will turn out that Reuven has lent Shimon a field worth 1,000 in return for 1,200.

After having sold all of the produce Shimon will owe Reuven both the value of the produce originally given or the money given to buy the produce, plus half of the profits from the sales.  In other words this is a typical investment loan made by the one who has the capital, Reuven, to the entrepreneur who is willing to turn the capital into a profit.  The problem is that this is a form of lending with interest.  In return for letting Shimon use his money or goods Reuven will receive half of the profits.  Therefore, the mishnah states that this type of deal is forbidden unless Reuven pays Shimon as a laborer.

Reuven gives Shimon either hens and eggs to raise and hatch, or young animals to raise until they mature.

In other words, if the animals live Shimon will return them to Reuven and split the profit (their gain in value as they mature).  However, if they die Shimon will not be responsible to return the value of the animals, as he was in the scenarios in sections one and two.  Since this is so, it is as if the risk involved in raising the animals is the wage that Shimon receives and when he returns a profit it is not considered interest. There is another interpretation of this clause.  According to this interpretation, in the scenario in this clause Shimon is only responsible for returning half the value of the original animal plus half of the profit.  In other words if Reuven gives him an animal worth 200 zuz and when it is raised it is worth 500 zuz.  Shimon pays back half the value of the original animal, 100, and receives half of the profit, 150.  Although Reuven in essence gave an animal worth 200 and receives back a total of 250 (500 zuz for the animal minus 250 which was paid to Shimon) this is not considered interest.  In this case Shimon and Reuven are true partners who are allowed to split profits.  In the previous cases mentioned in the mishnah Reuven was an investor, in which case taking interest in order to make a profit is forbidden."

If it is not the custom to turn over the young animals until they mature, there is still no problem of interest.

In order to understand this difference between gentiles and Jews we must understand that lending and borrowing with interest is not an immoral act.  It is actually fair and logical that the one who gives his money to others should receive a wage in return, just as one who gives his horse to others receives a wage in return.  The reason that the Torah forbids lending with interest to other Jews is that this is a form of charity.  A loan without interest is in actuality one of the highest forms of charity, and has been a practice of Jews throughout the ages.  According to Jewish law charity begins within one’s own community.  While it might be an ideal that one should be charitable to the whole world, it is impossible to obligate one community to support all communities.  A Jewish community is legally obligated to support the Jews within the community.  This obligation is not extended outside the community.

In such a manner the buyer will definitely not receive a benefit for having advanced the money. Rabbi Judah states that in general if the buyer prepaid for his produce and the produce later goes down in price, he may give the seller a choice of providing the produce at the lower amount or of returning the money.  Since the buyer did not actually take the produce and thereby legally acquire it, he is not legally obligated by the sale (Bava Metziah 4:2).

For Rabban Gamaliel used to lend his tenants wheat to be repaid in wheat when it was for planting. And if he lent it when the price was high and it afterward fell, or when it was low and it afterward rose, he used to take wheat back at the lower rate, not because such was the rule but because he wanted to be strict upon himself.</b> A person may not lend another person a seah of wheat on the condition that the other person pay back a seah of wheat.  The reason is that if the wheat rises in price after the loan the lender will receive in return more than he gave, and that is considered to be a form of interest.  Rather he would have to state an amount, such as 100 dollars worth of wheat and when he gets the loan back he will receive 100 dollars worth of wheat at whatever the rate is at the time of repayment. Our mishnah teaches that although one cannot loan wheat in order to be repaid in wheat when the wheat was intended for eating, one may do so when it is for planting and there is no concern that this be considered interest.  The simplest way of understanding this is that it is as if the owner is giving him a better field to work, which he is allowed to do. The second half of the mishnah teaches a stringency that Rabban Gamaliel took upon himself. Although it is permitted to lend wheat for wheat if the wheat is for planting, Rabban Gamaliel would always collect upon the lower rate.  In this way there was no potential that he would receive back a higher value than he gave in the beginning and thereby loan with interest."

If, however, the borrower has other wheat at the time he borrows from the other person, then it is permitted.  The reason that this is permitted is that the borrower could have repaid the wheat immediately after receiving the loan before the price might potentially rise.

If, however, Reuven helps weed and Shimon helps hoe or vice versa, and one of the labors is more difficult than the other, the bargain is forbidden because of usury.

The son goes out and hires workers at his father’s request and tells them that he will provide their food.

His father instructs the son to return and clarify to the workers that they are being hired under the condition that they will receive food but that the food will be minimal, consisting of only beans and bread. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel states that such a stipulation was not necessary.  According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel in a case where the quantity of food was not clarified, the employees can only claim that which is customarily given to workers in their area.  Since custom does not dictate that an employer provide his employees with food worthy of King Solomon he need not do so.

If the cow should die a natural death it will be in Shimon’s best interest that the cow died while it was being hired, since a hirer does not pay in cases of natural death.  It will be in Reuven’s best interest if the cow died while being borrowed since borrowers do pay in cases of natural death.  Our mishnah delineates the possible claims of Reuven and Shimon and the law in each case. Case a:  If Reuven, who lent the cow, claims that he is certain that the cow died while being rented or that the rented cow died and Shimon claims that he doesn’t know, Shimon is liable.  This goes according to the general principle that one who claims that he is certain has a stronger claim then one who claims he is not certain (see Steinsaltz reference guide, page 172. Case b:  Similarly, if Shimon claims that he is sure that the cow died while being borrowed or that the borrowed cow died and Reuven claims that he does not know, Shimon is exempt.  Since Shimon is certain that the borrowed cow died and Reuven doesn’t know, Shimon’s claim is stronger. Case c:  If they disagree and each claims that he is certain, Shimon takes an oath that it died while it was being hired and he is exempt from making restitution.  This is based on the principle that the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff.  Since in this case Reuven is the plaintiff and he cannot prove his claim, Shimon is exempt. Case d:  If both claim that they are uncertain then they split the loss of the cow.  In this case Shimon will pay Reuven half the value of the cow."

This law can work to the advantage of either the renter or the owner.  If the produce was of a poor quality the owner of the field will lose out for he cannot demand that the renter pay him back with better wheat.

A pledge is an object probably worth about the value of the loan.  The borrower actually gives the pledge to the lender before receiving the loan.  It is to be distinguished from collateral which does not go to the lender unless the borrower defaults on his loan.\nThere are three passages in Deuteronomy 24 concerning “pledges”.  Verse 6 states:  “Do not take a mill or an upper millstone as a pledge, for that would be taking someone’s life as a pledge”.  In other words, since these two objects are necessary to produce food, a lender is prohibited from taking them.  Verses 10-13 state two laws regarding pledges:  1) when one takes a pledge he must not enter the borrower’s house; 2)  if the lender is poor the borrower may not keep his pledge overnight.  The assumption here is that the pledge was a cloak in which the poor person will need to sleep.  Verse 17 states, “Do not take the a widow’s garment as a pledge”.",

Entering his house would humiliate the borrower.  The mishnah expands this prohibition to include any borrower, and not just one who is known to be poor.

The mishnah states that if the borrower had two such cloaks, and both were taken as a pledge, the creditor need only return one.  The Torah discusses only a cloak which is essential to the borrower at night; one that is not essential may indeed be kept overnight.  The mishnah adds that a creditor must return during the day items which are essential during the day, such as a plow.

When a building collapsed the broken materials would have been reused, either to rebuild the house or for other purposes.  Our mishnah discusses to whom do these materials belong, in the case where the upper story was owned by one person and the bottom story by another.  In general the two persons split the material under the assumption that half was used for the construction of the top story and half for the bottom. Beyond knowing that the two partners split the material, it is also necessary to decide which partner takes which stones.  After all, in some cases some of the stones may be more valuable than others, such as broken stones versus whole one.  To that end the mishnah makes two suggestions.  1)  They try to determine which part of the house broke, and therefore who gets the broken stones.  For instance if the house broke at its foundations the owner of the bottom floor gets the broken stones.  If it broke from above, the owner of the top floor takes the broken stones.  2)  If one of the partners recognizes his stones, he takes those stones and the other takes other stones.

Again, once the deal has been accepted the employer has no subsequent right to revoke it.",
                    "<b>One who removes his manure into the public domain:  from the time he removes it another may take it to manure [his fields].</b>  For obvious reasons, one may not remove his animal manure into the public domain.  If one did so, the manure, which in their time was considered valuable, became legally ownerless and anyone could come and claim it as their own.",
                    "<b>One may not soak clay or make bricks in the public domain, but clay may be kneaded in the public domain but not bricks.</b>  Similarly, one is not allowed to make bricks or soak clay in the public domain, for these types of work would pollute property that does not belong to any one person.  The mishnah does allow him to mix the clay in the public domain, for the clay would immediately be used in the building process. This type of mixing is brief as opposed to the original soaking of the clay which is a longer process and therefore forbidden in the public domain.  Similarly making bricks takes a considerable amount of time and is therefore forbidden in the public domain.",
                    "<b>One who builds in the public domain:  one brings the stones and another builds (. And if he causes damage, he pays what he has damaged. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:  “He may, indeed, make preparation for his work for thirty days [in the public domain].</b>  In order to build a house or other such structure in the private domain a person will often need to use the public domain to keep his wood and stones.  The mishnah teaches that if one wishes to make such a use of the public domain, one person must bring the wood and stones and another build with them immediately.  In other words it is forbidden to leave them there for an extended period of time.  Furthermore, even though the mishnah permits using the public domain for such a purpose, if the person caused damage he is liable. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel disagrees with the opinion taught in sections four and five.  According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel one may use the public domain for up to thirty days to prepare building properties: bricks, clay, stones and other necessities.",

What principles cause them to decide the law in such a manner?  Would it be proper to consider the Rabbis to be environmentalists or do they have other factors motivating them?"

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe final mishnah of Bava Metziah deals with two people who own adjacent gardens, one garden being at a higher level than the other.  In other words the gardens were terraced.  The following illustration should help.\nUpper Garden\nWall\nLower Garden\nThe mishnah deals with the issue of ownership over vegetables that grows from the wall separating the gardens.",
                    "<b>If there were two gardens [in terraces] one above the other and vegetables grew between them: Rabbi Meir says:  “They belong to the upper garden.” Rabbi Judah says:  “They belong to the lower garden.” Rabbi Meir said:  “If [the owner of] the upper garden wished to remove his soil there would be no vegetables.” Rabbi Judah said: “If [the owner of] the lower garden wished to fill up his garden [with soil] there would be no vegetables. (1) Rabbi Meir said:  “Since each is able to thwart the other, we should consider from where these vegetables derive their life.” Rabbi Shimon said:  “Whatever [the owner of ] the upper garden can take by stretching out his hand belongs to him, and the rest belongs to [the owner of] the lower garden.</b> In our mishnah both owners claim that the vegetables that grow on the wall between the two gardens belongs to them.  Rabbi Meir says that the vegetables belong to the owner of the upper garden and Rabbi Judah says that they go to the owner of the lower garden.  According to Rabbi Meir, since the owner of the upper garden could remove the soil and thereby remove the vegetables they must belong to him.  According to Rabbi Judah, since the owner of the lower garden could fill his garden with soil and thereby kill the vegetables, they must belong to him.  In clause (1) Rabbi Meir agrees with Rabbi Judah that each side could thwart the other side.  Nevertheless, Rabbi Meir sticks to his opinion, that the vegetables belong to the owner of the upper garden, since they derive their life from his soil and not from the air of the lower garden.  The end of the mishnah contains the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who reaches a compromise.  If the owner of the upper garden could reach out his hand and grab the vegetables they belong to him.  If not they belong to the owner of the lower garden.",
                    "<b>Questions for Further Thought:</b><br>• How is Rabbi Meir’s argument in section 1a) different from his subsequent argument in section (1)?Congratulations! We have finished Tractate Bava Metziah!It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives.For those of you who have learned with us the entire tractate and the entire previous tractate, Bava Kamma, a hearty Yasher Koach (congratulations).  You have accomplished a great deal in a short time and you should be proud of yourselves.  Of course, we still have a lot of mishnah ahead of us.  We will begin Bava Batra tomorrow!"
