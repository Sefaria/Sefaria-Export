The typical number for civil cases was three and the typical number for criminal cases was twenty-three.  The problem will arise in situations where it is not clear whether a certain case is civil or criminal.",
                    "<b>Cases concerning property [are decided] by three.</b>  Property cases include disputes arising out of loans, sales, inheritance, gifts and other similar monetary matters.",
                    "<b>Cases concerning robbery or personal injury, by three.</b>  Personal injury is a case where one person directly injures another.  Robbery, as we learned in Bava Kamma chapter nine, does not carry with it a penalty of twofold restitution as does thievery.",
                    "<b>Claims for full damages or half-damages, twofold restitution, or fourfold or fivefold restitution, by three.</b>  Full damages are assessed when a “warned” animal, one that has previously injured three times, causes further damage.  Half-damages are assessed when the damaging animal had not injured three times.  Twofold restitution is the penalty for a thief, and fourfold or fivefold restitution is the penalty for a thief who stole an animal and either sold it or slaughtered it.",
                    "<b>Claims against a rapist, a seducer and one who defames [a virgin are decided] by three, according to Rabbi Meir. The Sages say:  “One who defames [a virgin is decided] by twenty-three, for there may arise from it a capital case.</b>  According to the Torah the rapist (Deut. 22:29) and the seducer (Ex. 22:16-17) pay fines of 50 shekel for having illegally taken the woman’s virginity.  In addition, according to the Rabbis the rapist also pays for injuring the woman as would any person who causes another person injury (see Bava Kamma, chapter eight).  The “one who defames a virgin” is referred to in Deut. 22:13-22.  This is a case where a husband falsely claims that the wife was not a virgin.  If the husband was found to be a liar he is beaten and must pay a fine of 100 shekels.  If his accusation turned out to be true the woman is put to death.  The Rabbinic understanding of this law greatly differs from its simple understanding in the Torah, but now is not the place for a detailed explanation."

But if they decided upon it with three, the intercalation is valid.”</b>  A month according to the Jewish calendar is 29 or 30 days.  The court would decide each month whether the month should have 29 or 30 days.  This was the intercalation of the month.  The intercalation of the year was the decision whether or not to add another month of Adar (the twelfth month of the Jewish year if we begin counting at Nisan) in order to turn the twelve month year into a thirteen month year.  According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel, the process of the intercalation of the year is such a serious matter that it must be discussed by more than three judges.  The process is begun with three.  If they agree to intercalate the year two more judges are added.  If they still agree then yet another two judges are added.  If the seven agree then the year becomes intercalated.  However, if they decided with only three judges the intercalation is nevertheless valid.",

But Rabbi Judah says:  “By five.”<br>The rites of halitzah and “refusal” [are performed] before three.<br>The fruit of fourth year plantings and Second Tithes whose value is not known [are redeemed] before three.<br>Things dedicated to the Temple [are redeemed] before three.<br>Vows of evaluation to be redeemed with movable property, [are evaluated] before three. Rabbi Judah says: “One must be a priest.” [Vows of evaluation], [to be redeemed] with land [are evaluated] before nine and a priest.<br>And similarly [for the evaluation] of a man.</b><br>Mishnah three deals with the number of judges needed in cases that are of a religious/ritual nature.<br>Section one:  According to Leviticus 4:13-21, when the whole community of Israel commits an accidental transgression, they must bring a bull as a sin offering.  According to verse 15, before sacrificing the bull the elders would lay their hands on the bull’s head.  Our mishnah teaches that this laying on of the hands was done by three judges.<br>The “breaking of the heifer’s neck” refers to Deut. 21:1-9.  These verses describe a ritual of expiation that was to be done in the case where a person was found murdered but the murderer was unknown.  Deuteronomy refers to “elders” who were to carry out the process and our mishnah teaches that there were three.<br>Section two:  Halitzah is the refusal of the Levirate marriage (Deut. 25:5-10).  If a woman’s husband dies and they have no offspring, his brother is obligated to marry her and bring forth offspring on his dead brother’s behalf.  This is called “Levirate marriage”.  If the brother should refuse to do so, they must go through a process called Halitzah before the woman is free to marry someone else.  This is done in front of three judges.<br>“Refusal” refers to a daughter who was married off by her brother or mother.  According to the Rabbis a father has a right to marry off his daughter while she is a minor and this marriage is totally binding and the girl cannot be released from the marriage except upon the death of the husband or divorce.  However, a mother or brother’s ability to marry off the girl is less binding.  When she becomes of a majority age she may refuse her husband and thereby annul the marriage.  The “refusal” must be done in front of three judges.<br>Section three:  Plants that are in their fourth year and the Second Tithe must be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there.  If one lived far from Jerusalem and did not wish to carry all of this produce all the way to Jerusalem he could “redeem” the produce and bring the money to Jerusalem and use it to buy food there.  The redeeming had to be done in front of three judges.<br>Section four:  If a person dedicated an animal to the Temple that was not fit to be sacrificed, for instance a donkey, he could redeem the animal and donate the money to the Temple (Lev. 27:11).  The redemption had to be done in front of three.<br>Section five:  According to Lev. 27 a person could take a vow to donate his own value to the Temple.  In such a case the Torah gives set amounts of money that must be donated to the Temple, depending on the age and gender of the one who took the vow.  In general, since the Torah prescribes set amounts, no judges will be needed to evaluate how much the person owes.  If however, the person has no money, he will need to donate some of his property.  If the property to be donated is movable property a court of three is sufficient for its evaluation.  According to Rabbi Judah, one of them must be a priest.  If the property to be donated is land, a court of ten, including one priest is needed to determine the value of the land.  According to Lev. 27:8, if the one who took the vow could not afford to donate his own value a priest was allowed to assess how much he could afford.  According to the mishnah this assessment was done in front of a court of ten, which would include one priest."

According to the first opinion in the mishnah, these animals are also to be judged by a court of twenty three.  Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and says that the first person who sees them should kill them.  After all, these animals which are wild and cannot be guarded as an ox can be guarded, present a hazard to the safety of the public.

According to the mishnah in such a case the tribe is tried in front of seventy-one judges and not the twenty three who would adjudicate a normal case of idol worship (which is punishable by death). A false prophet is referred to in Deut. 18:20 which states that such a prophet should be executed.  The High Priest also may only be judged by a court of seventy one.  The common denominator between the High Priest and the prophet is the high regard that society would have for both of them.  In order to reflect this high regard and the public nature of such trials they would have been held in front of the Great Sanhedrin of 71.  Note that according to the Christian Bible, Mark 14:53ff and John 18:13 Jesus was tried in front of the Sanhedrin.

A mandatory war would be either a defensive war or a war whose purpose was to capture the Land of Israel as was in the days of Joshua.  A war of free choice would be one which expands the borders beyond the Biblical borders.  [Note: the Biblical borders are very difficult to delineate, and there are indeed several versions of them].  Since there will inevitably be heavy casualties in war, the decision to go to a war of free choice requires a full Sanhedrin of 71.  A mandatory war would not require the decision of any court.",

According to Deuteronomy only cities within the borders of Israel can become an Apostate City which is to be executed.  The fear is that if this law is performed on one of the border towns it will encourage raids from neighboring tribes, which would endanger all of Israel.

                    "<b>The greater Sanhedrin was made up of seventy one and the little Sanhedrin of twenty three.<br>From where do we learn that the greater Sanhedrin should be made up of seventy one? As it says, “Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel” (Num. 11:16), and when Moses is added to them there is seventy one. Rabbi Judah says:  “Seventy.”</b>  The greater Sanhedrin was composed of seventy one judges to correspond to the seventy elders plus Moses mentioned in Numbers 11:16.  According to Rabbi Judah, the seventy elders included Moses, and therefore the greater Sanhedrin was only to be composed of seventy one.",
                    "<b>From where do we learn that the little Sanhedrin should be made up of twenty three? As it says, “The assembly shall judge”, “The assembly shall deliver” (Num. 35:24-25), an assembly that judges and an assembly that delivers, thus we have twenty. And from where do we know that an assembly has ten? (1) As it says, “How long shall I bear this evil congregation?” (Num. 14:27) [which refers to the twelve spies] but Joshua and Caleb were not included. And from where do we learn that we should bring three others [to the twenty]? By inference from what it says, “You shall not follow after the many to do evil” (Ex. 23:2), I conclude that I must be with them to do well. Then why does it say, “[To follow] after the many to change judgment” (Ex. 23:2). [It means that] your verdict of condemnation should not be like your verdict of acquittal, for your verdict of acquittal is reached by the decision of a majority of one, but your verdict of condemnation must be reached by the decision of a majority of two. The court must not be divisible equally, therefore they add to them one more; thus they are twenty three.</b>  The exegesis used to derive the number 23 for the little Sanhedrin is much more complicated.  Firstly, from the verses in Numbers 35:24-25, which refer to an assembly that judges and an assembly that delivers the condemned from being punished, the Rabbis derive that capital cases require the potential to have both a full “assembly” that judges (convicts) and a full assembly that delivers (acquits).  Although this is certainly not the simple meaning of this verse, this is the way it is understood in our mishnah.  An assembly is taken to mean a group of ten, as proven from the use of the word in Num. 14:27.  If two “assemblies” are required than we need at least twenty on a court to adjudicate capital cases. In order to exegetically prove that we need another three, the mishnah turns to Exodus 23:2 and a potential redundancy between the two halves of the verse.  The first half states that one should not follow a majority of people in order to do evil, and therefore we could learn that one should follow the majority to do good.  However, this is understood to also be the explanation of the second half of the verse, which states that one should follow the majority, clearly to do good.  In order to solve this supposed redundancy the mishnah says that the majority needed to convict is not the same as the majority needed to acquit.  In order to acquit we only need a majority of one and in order to convict we need a majority of two.  The verse is therefore explained in the following manner:  when it says “, “You shall not follow after the many to do evil”, it means do not follow a majority of one to convict.  When it says “[To follow] after the many to change judgment”, it means you should follow a majority of two to acquit.  We have now arrived at the number twenty-two, since if an assembly (10) convicts we will need another assembly of 12 to acquit.  In order not to have a court that is even and therefore might not arrive at any decision, they add one more judge.",
                    "<b>And how many should there be in a city that it may be fit to have a Sanhedrin? A hundred and twenty. Rabbi Nehemiah says:  “Two hundred and thirty, so that [the Sanhedrin of twenty three] should correspond with them that are chiefs of [at least] groups of ten.</b>  In order for a city to be worthy or large enough to merit a little Sanhedrin, which according to mishnah five had to be appointed by the greater Sanhedrin, it had to have 120 permanent inhabitants.  According to Rabbi Nehemiah, it had to have 230 inhabitants, ten for each judge.  According to Rabbi Nehemiah this is so each judge can act as a chief of at least ten people, which is the smallest judicial appointment according to Ex. 18:21.",

If he should die without children, his wife must either marry his brother or his brother must perform halitzah for her.  If his brother should die without children he must perform halitzah for his wife.  He cannot, however, contract levirate marriage with her since he is in general prohibited from marrying a widow (Lev. 21:14).",

Rabbi Judah says, “He may not leave the Temple, as it says, “Nor shall he go out of the Sanctuary”. And when he comforts other mourners the custom is for all of the people to pass by, the one after the other, while the appointed [priest] stands between him and the people. And when he receives comfort from others, all the people say to him, “Let us be your atonement”, and he says to them, “May you be blessed by Heaven.” When they feed him the funeral meal all the people sit around on the ground and he sits on a stool.</b>  The High Priest is severely restricted with regards to his participation in the rituals of burial.  Since contact with the dead causes impurity the High Priest cannot even participate in the burying of his own immediate family (unlike a regular priest who may) (see Lev. 21:10-12).  According to Rabbi Meir, the High Priest is allowed to semi-secretly participate in the burial procession, up until they leave the city gates of Jerusalem (people were not buried within the city confines).  Rabbi Judah states that he may not even participate this much, since the Torah states that he may not leave the Sanctuary at all. If the High Priest needs to participate in the comforting of mourners he may do so, but the “appointed” priest would come in between him and the other people.  According to the Rambam this is to show the honor due to the High Priest, that he shouldn’t be just a part of the crowd. When others comfort him they say, “Let us be your atonement”.  It seems to me that this is to assuage the sense of guilt that the High Priest must feel since he was not able to participate in the burying of his own dead.  When he comforts others he should give them a blessing. When he is fed the traditional funeral meal which would normally be eaten by the mourner while sitting close to the ground, the rest of the people must sit on the ground.  This fulfills two functions:  1)  he retains a higher status than them; 2)  they are able to participate in his sorrow and grief."

When during the battles between the House of Saul and the House of David, Avner, Saul’s army commander, was murdered by Joab, the commander of David’s army for  having killed Joab’s brother, David goes out after Avner’s bier.  According to Rabbi Judah this is precedent for any king.  The Sages reply to Rabbi Judah that David only did so to appease the people so that they wouldn’t say that Joab killed Avner with David’s permission.  In other, normal, cases it is forbidden for the king to participate in the funeral procession.<br>When the people feed the king his funeral meal, they sit on the floor, to show their participation in his grief and he sits on a couch, since he is not allowed to truly mourn.

Rabbi Shimon says:  “Even one that might turn his heart away, he should not marry.  Why then does it say, “He shall not have many wives”, even if they are like Avigayil.</b>  The remainder of the mishnah is a midrash (exegesis) on Deuteronomy 16-19.  The first midrash discusses the limitation on the number of wives a king may take.  According to the first opinion he may only (!) have 18 wives.  Rabbi Judah emphasizes the continuation of verse 17 which says, “lest his heart go astray.”  According to Rabbi Judah the verse does not prohibit a certain number of wives, rather it prohibits the king from taking any wife who will lead his heart astray.  The Bible itself relates that this is exactly what happened with Solomon in his old age (See I Kings 11).  Rabbi Eliezer responds to Rabbi Judah and says that if the verse had only meant to say that he may not marry women who will lead his heart astray then why did it state a specific number.  Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer says that he may not marry many wives even if they were like Avigayil, David’s wife, who is the prototypical example of a smart and good wife (see I Samuel 25:3).",

The mishnah emphasizes that this Torah scroll must always be with him, even when he goes out to war!  The king is to always be reminded that he serves a higher King, God.

The Torah states that the people of Israel shall set a king upon themselves.  The Torah uses a typical syntax repeating the verb “to set” twice.  In usual fashion, the Rabbis see this as an unnecessary repetition of a word and therefore a legitimate basis for a midrash.  The midrash is that the Torah mandates awe of the king, and therefore one is not allowed to not sit in his place, use his scepter or see him in a position of compromise."

All agree that the first two judges are selected by the litigants themselves, each litigant choosing one judge.  However, Rabbi Meir and the Sages dispute with regards to the selection of the third judge.  Rabbi Meir holds that the litigants together select a third judge and the Sages hold that the first two judges, those already selected by the litigants, are the ones to select the third judge.<br>With regards to the invalidation of the judges, Rabbi Meir holds that each litigant can indiscriminately invalidate the judge who was chosen by the opposing litigant.  The Sages hold that the judges may only be invalidated on objective grounds, for either being relatives of the litigant or otherwise invalid.  (We will learn more about the what cause a person to be invalid to be a a judge in mishnah three).  If the judges are otherwise valid the opposing litigant may not disqualify them.<br>The Sages and Rabbi Meir have basically the same dispute with regard to witnesses.  Note, that in this case Rabbi Meir’s opinion is much more radical.  If a litigant can disqualify his rival’s witnesses without any due cause, how could anyone ever be convicted.  The Talmud deliberates at length on this problem and makes several suggestions:  1)  the litigant can only disqualify witnesses when there is only one witness.  In such a case, since there are not the requisite number of witnesses, the litigant is not truly destroying his rival’s case; 2)  the mishnah deals with a case where a person has two sets of witnesses, and the rival disqualifies only one set; 3) the rival has another witness who testifies with him that the other witnesses are disqualified; 4) the litigant claimed that the judges and witnesses were not valid.  When it is established by independent evidence that he told the truth about the judges, he is believed with regard to the witnesses.<br>In any case, from the fact that there are four solutions to this problem, we can see how puzzling Rabbi Meir’s opinion truly is."

On the other hand, Rabbi Meir says that if, during the trial or even after the trial the litigant who accepted the relative or criminal were to change his mind, he could do so and ask for a retrial.

Rabbi Shimon said:  “In the beginning they called them ‘gatherers’ of Seventh Year produce, but after the oppressors grew many they changed this and called them ‘traffickers’ of Seventh Year produce.” Rabbi Judah said:  “This applies only if they have no other trade, but if they have some other trade other than that, they are not disqualified.”</b> There are four types of people who are disqualified from acting as witnesses or judges:  1)  The first is a dice player, in other words a gambler.  Such a person cannot testify since he is known to be a liar, especially with regards to monetary matters.  Another reason is that he doesn’t participate constructively in building society. 2)  A usurer.  He is also probably considered to not be trustworthy in monetary matters.  3)  A pigeon racer.  Racing pigeons was a form of gambling.  4)  Those who sell produce grown during the Seventh Year. According to Lev. 25:5-7 produce grown in the fields during the Seventh Year may be eaten by its owners, but it may not be sold.  One who therefore sells Seventh Year produce is engaging in forbidden business practices which according to our mishnah make him not trustworthy to testify or act as a judge. Rabbi Shimon points out that this law actually was different in an earlier period. According to Rabbi Shimon at first the law was stricter and forbade even those who gathered Seventh Year produce from testifying or judging.  Although eating from the fields was permitted, a person who gathered the produce was suspected of later selling it, which was prohibited.  Therefore, they originally forbade even those who gathered Seventh Year produce from testifying. However, once the oppressors grew too many they relaxed the prohibition.  In the Talmud it is explained that the “oppressors” refers to the Roman government which demanded taxes from the produce grown on the land, even during the Seventh Year.  The Rabbis therefore permitted a person to gather his produce and give it for taxes.  When this happened they decided to allow people who gathered Seventh Year produce to testify. Rabbi Judah adds an important qualification on those who are prohibited from testifying.  These people are disallowed to testify only if they have no other profession.  If gambling or racing pigeons was only a hobby or an irregular activity they could still act as witnesses or as judges.",

Rabbi Yose said, “Such was the mishnah of Rabbi Akiva, but the first mishnah taught: ‘a suitor’s uncle, or his uncle’s son, and all that are qualified to be his heir.</b>  The first section lists relatives who are disqualified from testifying.  The list is self explanatory, and only a few require explanation.  A mother’s husband refers to someone who is not the suitor’s father.  Any son or son-in-law of any of these listed relatives is likewise forbidden to testify.  For instance one’s father’s brother’s son (a cousin) is forbidden to testify.  The only exception is that the suitor’s stepson, i.e. his wife’s son from another marriage, is forbidden to testify but stepson’s son is allowed. Rabbi Yose gives us a glimpse into the development of the Mishnah.  The previous clause was the mishnah of Rabbi Akiva, who lived from about 50-135 C.E.  Rabbi Yose then relates the way it was taught before this time.  While there are some legal differences between the two formulations, the most basic difference is that “first mishnah” used language that approximated Biblical style (see Lev. 25:49).  This change from the earlier language to the later style which was more distinct from the Biblical language, may signify the growing independence of the Oral Torah from the Written Torah.  It seems likely that in an earlier stage the Oral Torah was usually preserved as an exegesis or midrash on the verses of the Torah.  The advantage to this system was that the Torah was a text known to most.  The second advantage was that it was clear that Rabbinic law attained its authority by its being an interpretation of Biblical law.  However, the biggest detriment was its lack of organization.  Many laws appear in parallel forms in several books of the Torah.  For instance laws concerning slavery appear in Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy.  Laws concerning the redemption of the first born appear in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.  One who wished to know the law would not know where to find it.  One of the innovations of Rabbi Akiva was to sort Jewish law into topical tractates.  In our mishnah we see that as this processed developed the language of the laws changed from Biblical to Rabbinic Hebrew. As far as substantive differences between the first mishnah and Rabbi Akiva’s mishnah.  There are three potential differences:  his mother’s sister’s husband, his mother’s husband and his wife’s sister’s husband.  These three men are not potential inheritors and therefore could testify according to the first mishnah, but they may not according to Rabbi Akiva’s mishnah.",
                    "<b>Moreover all that were kinsmen at the time [are disqualified]; but kinsmen that have ceased to be kinsmen become qualified.” Rabbi Judah says:  “If a man’s daughter died and left children, her husband still counts as a kinsman.”</b>  Only if the relative is a current relative may he not testify.  If the relationship is by marriage and it is severed through divorce before the trial, the formal relative may testify.  Rabbi Judah states that there is one exception to this rule.  If a daughter married a man and had children the husband cannot testify, even after the daughter dies.  Since the children bind the husband to the grandfather, he is still considered to be a relative."

(2)  The second step was to remove all but one of the witnesses, so that they would not merely mimic each other’s testimony.  Jewish law is strict in requiring two independent witnesses, and one may not therefore learn of his testimony from another.  (3)  They could now begin interrogating the most important of the witnesses.  The witness is asked how he received that information that so-and-so owes someone money.  The only answer that is accepted as valid testimony is for the witness to say that he saw the defendant actually admit to the plaintiff that he is in debt to him.  If a third party told the witness that the defendant was obligated, or even if the defendant himself admitted such, the testimony is not accepted.  (4)  Afterwards they repeat the process with the second witness.  (5)  If the testimony of all of the witnesses is found to be in agreement, the judges discuss the matter.  (6) A majority decision is always accepted as binding, as long as all of the judges have made a conclusive decision. If one of the judges said that he did not know they must add more judges until there are three judges who have actually rendered decisions.

Know, moreover, that capital cases are not like non-capital cases:  in non-capital cases a man may pay money and so make atonement, but in capital cases the witness is answerable for the blood of him [that is wrongfully condemned] and the blood of his descendants [that should have been born to him] to the end of the world.”</b>  The mishnah begins with an exhortation made by the judges to the witnesses before they testify.  The judges warn the witnesses of the severity of their testimony and they warn them that secondhand testimony, even if it was heard from a reliable source is inadmissible.  The judges also remind the witnesses that they will be examined carefully. The judges then warn the witnesses that the consequences of executing a wrongfully accused person are extremely serious and indeed eternal.

The midrash is based on the fact that God uses the plural “bloods” instead of blood.  This is to teach us that Cain killed not only Abel but all of Abel’s descendants as well.

Again [but a single person was created] for the sake of peace among humankind, that one should not say to another, “My father was greater than your father”. Again, [but a single person was created] against the heretics so they should not say, “There are many ruling powers in heaven”.

Therefore everyone must say, “For my sake was the world created.”</b>  The mishnah now proceeds with four different reasons why God at first created only one human being.  The first reason is that it was meant to teach us that one human being is in and of himself or herself an entire world.  Therefore, one who kills another person it is as if he destroys an entire world and one who saves another person it is as if he saves an entire world.  [This line may be familiar from the beginning of Schindler’s List.  It is probably one of the more famous lines in the Mishnah]. The second reason is so that people will not brag about their lineage.  Since we all come from the same person, no one can say “my father is greater than yours.” The third reason is to prove to the heretics that there is only one God.  If more than one person had been originally created people might claim that each God created his own human being. The fourth reason is to show the greatness of God, that although God created only one human, and each subsequent person is therefore stamped with Adam’s genes, no two people look or are alike. This teaches us that each person must say that for his/her sake the world was created.",

These three questions are sufficient in order to establish when and where the crime was committed.  The Sages, whose anonymous opinion is taught in section one, hold that by asking many questions they can check to see if the witness is truly confused with regards to his testimony.  If he gets confused then it is a sign that his testimony may not be accurate.<br>Aside from the questions of time and place the judges would also ask the witnesses if they recognized the accused, and in the case of murder they would also ask if the witnesses recognized the murdered person.

Therefore some months are of 29 days and some are of 30.  In the time of the Mishnah the Jewish calendar was not yet fixed.

This makes strong sense if we remember that they certainly did not have clocks in the time of the Mishnah.  A two hour discrepancy does invalidate the testimony.

Note that the mishnah gives numerous opportunities for a judge who voted for conviction to overturn his ruling and vote for acquittal.

If at any point the defendant is found to be innocent the trial is over and he is dismissed. If after the initial vote he is found to be guilty, the judges adjourn for the day in order to “sleep” on the case.  During this time the judges continuously debate the merits of the case, and neither eat a lot nor drink wine.<br>When they reassemble the next morning each judge is asked again to state his opinion.

If a judge states that he does not know whether to convict or acquit he is not counted as part of the quorum of judges.  Therefore, even if 22 judges either convict or acquit and one states that he doesn’t know, they need to add more judges in order to fill the quorum of twenty three.  These judges who are added in are, as we learned in chapter four, mishnah four, moved up from the ranks of the disciples who sit before the judges.  They continue to add judges until they reach either a majority of two in favor of conviction or a majority of one in favor of acquittal.  The maximum number of judges is 71, which is the number of the Great Sanhedrin.  If, even after there are 71 judges there is still a majority of only one in favor of conviction, they keep discussing the merits of the case until one who had voted for conviction changes his mind and votes for acquittal.

Although stoning sounds like quite a brutal death, and it certainly must have been painful, as we read the chapter try to keep in mind that execution was an acceptable punishment in all societies in the ancient world.  It is also mentioned numerous times in the Bible.  Stoning as a mode of execution is also mentioned many times in the Bible.  It would be anachronistic of us to expect the Rabbis to exclude the possibility of execution.  On the other hand, you should note how cautious the Rabbis were in even theoretically punishing someone through execution.  The possibility of the convict’s being exonerated always remained open, even until the last moment.  Even while performing the execution the Rabbis were extremely concerned for the respect shown to the convict’s body, as we will see in later mishnayoth.  Finally, we must keep in mind that the requirements for proper testimony were so strict that convicting someone would be extremely difficult.  Indeed, execution was probably rarely, if ever, carried out, at least according to the rules of Jewish law.<br>Our mishnah describes the process of stoning, one of the four methods of execution which the mishnah describes.  The other three will be described later.<br>The stoning was not done at the place of the trial, but rather further away from the city.  This is proven from a verse in Leviticus which describes taking out the person who cursed God, a capital crime according to the Torah.  According to our mishnah “taking out” implies that they took him out of the city.<br>There are two functionaries described in our mishnah:  one who would hold a handkerchief, or flag of some sort and would stay near the court, and one who would ride on a horse and stand some distance from the first man, but still be able to see him.  If someone came and offered testimony that would exonerate the convict, the man with the handkerchief would wave and the man on the horse would see the sign and ride out and halt the execution.  Even if the convict himself brought up new testimony they would halt the execution, provided he made a substantial claim.  If at any time they found in his favor, he would be immediately dismissed.  Although this might be a rare occurrence, being so late in the process, nevertheless the mishnah considers it important to remind us that it is never to late to change a verdict from guilty to innocent.<br>As they are bringing the convict out to be stoned a herald would walk in front of him announcing who he was and why he was being executed.  We might have assumed that the purpose of such a custom would be to make an example of the accused, and thereby prevent others from repeating his crime.  However, the mishnah does not describe this as the reason for the herald’s crying out.  Rather, this is yet another opportunity to find someone to exonerate the convict, and thereby prevent an innocent person’s blood from being shed."

[Tell me what you have done, do not hold anything back from me.” And Achan answered Joshua and said, “It is true, I have sinned against the Lord the God of Israel, and this is what I have done” (Josh. 7:19-20). And how do we know that his confessions made atonement for him? As it says, “And Joshua said, “What calamity have you brought upon us!  The Lord will bring calamity upon you this day” (Josh. 7:35),  [meaning] this day you are a calamity, but you are not to be a calamity in the next world. And if he does not know how to confess, they say to him, “Say, may my death be an expiation for all my sins.”</b>  When the convict reaches ten cubits distance from the place where he is to be stoned, he is asked to confess of his crimes.  The mishnah teaches that anyone who confesses, no matter how heinous their crime, has a place in the world to come.  This lesson is based the story of Achan in the book of Joshua.  When Joshua conquered Jericho, the people were not supposed to take anything from the city.  Rather they were supposed to kill anything that was alive and bring only the silver and gold to the treasury.  Achan violated this ruling and took from the proscribed property of Jericho.  As a punishment God causes Israel to lose their subsequent battle at Ai (Joshua, chapter 7).  When Joshua figures out that their loss was due to Achan’s taking from the proscribed property, he sentences Achan to death for having violated God’s word not to take from the property of Jericho.  Joshua requests of Achan to confess his crime, which he subsequently does.  The innovation that our mishnah makes is that this confession expiates Achan of his crime and Achan therefore has a place in the world to come.  Joshua says to Achan, “What calamity have you brought upon us!  The Lord will bring calamity upon you this day”.  The simple sense of the verse is that God is punishing Achan and carrying out the punishment today.  The midrashic reading of our mishnah is that God is punishing Achan only today, and he will not punish him tomorrow.  Achan, therefore, has a place in the world to come. Even one who does not know how to confess is taught how to do so.  The Rabbis are concerned that although the criminal’s time in this world is drawing to a close, he should still be able to have a share in the world to come.",

Rather he can make a general statement, asking for forgiveness from other sins.  The Sages disagree with Rabbi Judah.

The clothing would present a barrier that would prolong his death and therefore prolong his suffering. Both the Sages and Rabbi Judah agree that a woman is stoned while clothed.  Evidently this is out of a sense of modesty.  Note, that even while executing a person, the Rabbis are concerned with issues of personal modesty.

The Torah is concerned for the respect due to the human body and therefore it states that leaving a body hanging overnight is strictly forbidden.",

If that caused his death, he had fulfilled [his duty]; but if not, the second witness took a stone and threw it on his chest. If he died thereby, he had done [his duty]; but if not, he [the criminal] was stoned by all Israel, for it is says: “The hand of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people” (Deut. 17:7).</b>  According to the Rabbis, stoning was not carried out by throwing stones at the person until he dies, which would seem to be the normal way that one would understand stoning.  Rather the person is pushed off a two story platform and then stones are dropped on him.  The first witness is the one who pushes him off and if he dies then the execution is over and no further stoning is done. If the person is still alive then the second witness throws a stone on him.  If he dies the execution is over, but if he remains alive the rest of Israel throws stones at him.  This process is based on a biblical verse.  We should note two things.  First of all the mishnah is careful to stone the person only until he dies.  Once he dies, the Rabbis forbade further disfiguration of his body.  Second, the Torah requires the witnesses to take part in the stoning.  A witness must believe his testimony firmly enough to actually carry out the execution himself.  In some cases this might discourage false testimony.",

But the sages say: a man is hanged, but not a woman. Rabbi Eliezer said to them: “But did not Shimon ben Shetah hang women at ashkelon?” They said: “[On that occasion] he hanged eighty women, even though two must not be tried on the same day.</b>  According to Rabbi Eliezer, the Torah commands that all executed people are hung after their execution.  However, the Sages say that this is done only to the blasphemer (of God) and to the idol worshipper. Rabbi Eliezer states that both men and women are to be hung, whereas the Sages say that only men are hung.  Note that even though Rabbi Eliezer believes that women are hung, he is still concerned with their modesty.  In order to prove his point that women are also hung, Rabbi Eliezer brings up the precedent of Shimon ben Shetach, an early Sage, who hung 80 women in Ashkelon.  (We don’t know why he hung them).  The Sages retort that this hanging was not done according to the law, for Jewish law forbids convicting even two people on one day.

Note that the hanging described by the mishnah is not done by the person’s neck but rather by their hands.  This is, of course, closer to what we would call crucifixion.  However, according to the Rabbis hanging is not a form of the death penalty but is to be performed after the execution has been carried out.  The body must be let down immediately.  Indeed according to other sources, one hand puts the body up and another lets it down.  The disgrace done to the body is indeed only momentary. The verse in Deuteronomy states that a hanged body is a disgrace to God.  Our mishnah understands that the verse comes to teach that people who see the body hanging will realize that it was because he cursed God, either by explicitly doing so or by worshipping idols, as we learned in section two.",

Furthermore, according to the Rabbis, execution expiates the criminal of his sin, thereby allowing him a place in the world to come.  Our mishnah continues with this trend by stating God’s pain at the loss of even a criminal.

Although most Jews do not still observe this custom, mostly due to people having to travel to make the funeral, and many funerals are delayed by a day or two, Jews in Jerusalem are still usually buried on the same day that they die.  Furthermore, Jewish law prohibits the use of chemicals to preserve the body, making a quick burial all the more imperative.

Jewish burial, and indeed many forms of ancient burial, was a two stage process.  First the person was buried and allowed to lie in the ground until his flesh deteriorated.  When this occurred they would collect the bones and put them into an ossuary with the bones from other deceased members of his family.

This is the first step of reconciliation:  allowing the criminal’s bones to rejoin the bones of his family.  The mishnah then prescribes a procedure in which the relatives of the criminal were to greet the judges and witnesses, thereby tacitly admitting that the verdict had been correct.  This second process of reconciliation and admission to the authority of the court allows society to return to some sense of normalcy, after the severe disruption of an execution.  Finally, although the family may not observe proper mourning rites, which would involve elaborate eulogies and public rituals, inappropriate for a criminal, they were allowed to observe the private ritual of grief.  While the mishnah cannot allow the public ritual, it is sensitive to the private needs of the mourning family.  This too is a form of reconciliation, as if the court is saying to the family that although your relative was a criminal, the moral stain is not borne by his entire surviving family.

The Sages said to him:  “That was because the court at that time was not well learned in law.</b><br>Our mishnah describes how execution by burning was to be carried out.  It might be helpful to begin with Rabbi Eleazar ben Zadok (section three), who testifies to having seen a priest’s daughter executed by being totally burnt (evidently alive).  This follows the seemingly simple requirement mentioned in Lev. 21:9, that a priest’s daughter who committed adultery should be burned. However, the Sages who disagree with him, and those who state their opinion in section one, believed that execution by burning was to be done by burning up the insides of the person.  They would open up his mouth and throw burning material inside and it would descend and burn him from the inside.  Rabbi Judah’s dispute with the Sages is with regards to the manner in which they would force open his mouth; he does not disagree with the Sages general understanding of how execution by burning was carried out.  Rabbi Judah is concerned lest in the process of opening his mouth they strangle him which is a different form of execution.<br>It is worth discussing briefly the nature of the two different understandings of death by burning.  The Rabbis prescribe a form of burning that doesn’t seem to be the simple understanding of the Torah.  When the Torah states that someone is to be burned, it probably means an execution similar to that referred to by Rabbi Eleazar ben Zadok in section three.  Therefore the question needs to be asked:  why did the Rabbis insist that burning would take place by burning the inside and not the outside?  The answer is probably not that one form of death was more or less painful than the other.  They both sound quite painful.  The best answer that is borne out by many other sources, is that the Rabbis did not want to sanction an execution in which the outer body was disfigured.  While they believed in the death penalty (again, at least theoretically) they wanted to execute the criminal while doing as little physical, external damage to the body as possible.  The body, after all, is a gift from God, and while the person may deserve death according to the law, damaging the body serves no purpose.  This is to be contrasted to other cultures that have existed until this very day, who considered the public disfiguring of the body of the criminal to be desirable, either as an example to the rest of society, or as a means to take vengeance even on the corpse.  The Rabbis took a strong stand against such practices, one that we will see in several places.  Indeed we have already seen this attitude in the previous chapter, when it stated that the hanged body was to be taken down immediately.  Although the criminal deserved to die, mutilating his body was indeed, according to Jewish law, an affront to God."

Although it is hard for us to understand why one form of decapitation is more disgraceful than the others, the important issue in this mishnah is that both sides want to prevent a disgraceful execution.

Again, we see in this mishnah that the Sages tried as much as possible to prevent disfiguration to the body.  This is accomplished in our mishnah by putting the rough rope inside a soft rope.  Although in either way the condemned will die, the soft rope will leave less damage on the body.

However, due to the subversive nature of idol worship, the Rabbis allowed entrapping of one who was trying to incite others to worship idols.  Such a form of entrapment was forbidden in all other cases.  The reason that this was allowed in this case was to prevent one from inciting many individuals privately, thereby circumventing any possible punishment by the court.  The mishnah now explains how this works. If he had incited two people directly, the two of them may bring him to court and he can be tried based on their testimony.  If he incited one person, that person should first attempt to get the inciter to say the same thing to other people, and if he does they may bring him to court and testify against him.  Should the inciter be clever and not repeat the same words in front of more than one person, the person who has already heard what the inciter said may hide witnesses behind a partition and encourage the inciter to repeat his words.  Interestingly, the person who is being incited should even at this late stage try to get the inciter to recant.  Jewish law is more interested in having the person recant and return to being part of the Jewish people than having him stoned.  If he does not, however, recant, these witnesses may testify against him in a court of law, and if found guilty he will be stoned.",

This is proven at the end of the mishnah in sections 2g and 2gi.  The verse from Deuteronomy states that the parents must accuse their child of being a glutton or a drunkard.  The verses from Deuteronomy do not explain what these two terms mean.  In the book of Proverbs it is stated that a glutton refers to one who eats too much meat and a drunkard is one who drinks too much wine.  From here the mishnah concludes that the child must have drunk wine and eaten meat in order for him to be wayward and rebellious.  The Rabbis disagree with regards to how much wine and meat he drank.",

Although there is no clear proof for this, there is at least a hint, as it is says, “Do not be among wine drinkers, among gluttonous meat eaters of flesh (Proverbs 23:20).</b>  This section lists all sorts of circumstances of eating and drinking that would not cause him to be a wayward and rebellious son.  These circumstances can be divided into two types:  1)  religious celebrations; 2)  consumption of forbidden food.  If he ate at a religious celebration he cannot be punished since it is praiseworthy to eat much wine and meat at such affairs.  These types of affairs are listed in the first three clauses of the section.  Second tithe, mentioned in section b, is consumed only in Jerusalem, and therefore by eating it there he is fulfilling a religious duty.  Clauses c and d list several foods that are forbidden to be consumed, whether they are agricultural products who have not had the agricultural offerings separated from them (untithed produce, etc.), meat that was not slaughtered properly (carrion or terefoth) or animals that are forbidden to eat (abominable and creeping things).  The Talmud explains that eating or drinking these things do not make one a wayward and rebellious son because the parents state, “He does not listen to our voice”, whereas one who eats these things doesn’t listen even to God’s voice.  A wayward and rebellious son is only defiant to his parents but not to his entire religious obligation.

Rabbi Yose bar Yehudah said: “Until he steals from his father and mother.”</b> According to our mishnah in order for a son to become a “wayward and rebellious son” he must steal from his father and consume the stolen food on other people’s property.  This is because stealing from his father is easy due to his easy access to his father’s property.  Eating the stolen food on other people’s property is also easy, since other people will not know that that which he is eating was stolen.  Any other combination of stealing and eating will not make him a “wayward and rebellious son”, since one element will not be so easy.  In other words, in order to be a “wayward and rebellious son” he must violate the norms of society in a way that will be easy and therefore encourage him to continuously do so.  A riskier action is less likely to be repeated and is therefore more lightly punished. According to Rabbi Judah he must steal from both his father and mother. This “egalitarian” approach is probably based on the fact that the verses in Deuteronomy say that both parents bring the child to his punishment, as we will learn in greater depth in the next mishnah.

On this one verse the Rabbis made a number of restrictions on the applicability of the case of the wayward and rebellious son.  First of all, a most basic understanding of this verse states that both the father and mother must agree to the punishment.  This is to prevent one parent from punishing the child without the consent of the other parent. Rabbi Judah learns something slightly more complicated from this verse.  He states that if the woman was not “fit” for her husband, the child cannot be punished.  One explanation for the word “fit” is that the marriage was a forbidden marriage (for instance a Kohen and a divorcee).

The verse states that the parents must “take him out”:  therefore parents with physical disabilities (probably unable to walk) cannot fulfill the procedure.

While disciplining the son by beating him only requires a court of three, executing him requires a court of twenty three, as do all executions.

If he did not do it by design, but it came about by an act of God…”.  The Rabbis in our mishnah seem to be discussing what does “by design” mean.  How much intention must there be in the act of murder for someone to be liable in the death penalty.  While I am not an expert on modern law, I know that our modern law system also distinguishes between degrees of murder based on the level of intention in the act.",

However, instead of killing one of these, he kills someone for whom he is liable for the death penalty.  In such a case, since he did not fulfill his intention, he is not liable for the death penalty, even though he did kill someone for whom he is generally liable.  We should note that although according to our mishnah, one does not receive the death penalty for killing a non-Jew, Jewish law certainly today forbids doing so.  With regards to the prematurely born child, it is also important to note that our mishnah is referring to a child who will certainly die.  In our days a prematurely born child often times lives, and therefore is no different from any other child.  We indeed can be thankful for the many advances in modern medicine, advances which have surely had and will continue to have an impact on many areas of Jewish law.",

But if he intended to strike his loins with sufficient force to kill, but struck the heart instead, he is liable.

If he intended to strike him on his chest with a blow that would be sufficient to kill but he struck him on his waist where the blow would generally not be sufficient to kill, but nevertheless it did kill, he is not liable.  Since normally this strike would not kill where it did end up landing, he is not held liable.  We can summarize that in order to be liable one must strike a place on the victim’s body with a blow generally strong enough to kill when struck on that place, and one must have intended to strike that place from the outset. If one intended to strike an adult with a strike that was insufficient to kill an adult but struck a child he is not liable for the death penalty, since if the strike had landed where he had intended it would not have killed.  If he intended to strike a minor with a strike insufficient to kill a minor but he struck an adult instead and the adult died he is not liable, since, normally this strike would not kill an adult. The final two clauses of this section teach cases where he is liable.  If he intended to strike him on his waist and it was sufficient to kill and he struck him on his chest and killed him he is liable.  Although he did not intend to strike him there, since his intention had been to strike with a blow strong enough to kill no matter where it hit, he is liable.

The Sages in section one had stated that if he intended to kill an animal and instead killed a person he is not liable.  The reason seems to be that he intended on killing something for which he would not receive the death penalty.  One can deduce, therefore, that if he had intended on killing one adult Jew but instead killed another, he would be liable for the death penalty.  Rabbi Shimon states that even if one intended on killing someone for whom one would receive the death penalty, if he did not fulfill his exact intention, he is not liable for the death penalty.",

(1) Rabbi Shimon said to them:  “If burning was not severer, it would not be decreed for a priest's adulterous daughter.” (2) They replied: “If stoning was not severer, it would not be the penalty of a blasphemer and an idolater.” If men condemned to decapitation became mixed up with others condemned to strangling, Rabbi Shimon said:  “They are [all] decapitated.” The sages say: “They are [all] strangled.”</b>  The remainder of the mishnah deals with the intermixing of persons condemned to different types of death penalties.  The principle is stated very clearly in the beginning of the section that in such a case they all receive the most lenient of the death penalties to which any one person in the group had been condemned.  The remainder of the disputes between Rabbi Shimon and the Sages are over which types of execution are more serious than the others.  This dispute was already discussed in the beginning of chapter seven.  Rabbi Shimon believes that burning is more serious than stoning, whereas the Sages believe that stoning is more serious.  Each side tries to prove his case by bringing an example of a serious crime which is punished by one of these types of execution.  According to Rabbi Shimon, the fact that an adulterous daughter of a priest (kohen) is punished by burning proves that burning is more serious.  According to the Sages, the fact that the blasphemer and the idol worshipper are punished by stoning proves that stoning is more serious.  Finally, in the end of the mishnah we learn that according to Rabbi Shimon strangling is more serious than decapitation, whereas according to the Sages, decapitation is more serious.

We will explain.  If he marries a widow’s daughter, this woman is now forbidden to him since she is his mother-in-law but she is not forbidden as a married woman, since she is a widow.  If he were to now have relations with her he would be punished through burning.  If she were then to get married, the punishment would also be strangulation.

The first crime is stealing a sacred vessel from the Temple.  The second crime is one who used the name of an idol to curse another person.  The third crime is one who has relations with an Aramean woman (or any idol worshipping woman).  The quintessential example of the zealot in the Torah is the example Pinchas, who upon seeing an Israelite having sexual relations in public with an Midianite woman, kills the two of them on the spot.  God rewards Pinchas for his zealotry by giving him a “covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:6-13).

                    "<b>Introduction</b> Chapter ten of Sanhedrin is one of the most theologically challenging chapters in the entire Mishnah.  It lists those people who have a part in the world to come (olam haba) and those who don’t.  There are two main opinions amongst Jewish authorities with regards to the definition of olam haba referred to in our chapter.  There are those who say that the mishnah refers to a future time when God will resurrect the dead (tehiyat hametim) which will happen only after the coming of the Messiah (yemot hamashiach).  Others say that the Mishnah refers to what is called to in modern language “heaven”.  This final opinion is the opinion of Maimonides (the Rambam) who wrote a lengthy treatise on our chapter in which he included his thirteen principles of faith, which were later summarized in the “Yigdal” a poem commonly sung in synagogues.  We do not have the space to go into detail with regards to the differing Jewish opinions on these concepts (olam haba, tehiyat hametim and yemot hamashiach).  Nevertheless it is worthy to mention that the Rambam categorizes three different types of approaches to “agaddah” or Rabbinic texts of legendary nature, in which he includes this entire chapter.  There are those who take each and every word literally and believe them to be true.  There are others who assume that the Rabbis meant their words to be taken literally and since these thoughts contradict provable nature, they assume the Rabbis to be foolish.  Finally, there are those who understand the legends of the Rabbis to be allegories, human language meant to convey divine truth.  The Rabbis were confined to the limited language with which all human beings communicate and therefore could not fully describe the infinite aspects of the divine. Finally, while our chapter is theologically dogmatic, it is worthwhile noting that the Talmudic commentary on this chapter, contains, as usual, differing opinions with regards to these matters.  With some notable exceptions, Jewish thinkers have tended not to be theologically dogmatic, allowing Jews to preserve a variety of opinions and philosophies with regards to our understanding of God and creation.  When approaching this chapter we should therefore understand it to contain one opinion with regards to these matters and not the only authoritative opinion that exists.",

Our mishnah proves this from the verse from Isaiah which states “all of them (Israel) are righteous”.  Since it is apparent that in this world not all Jews are righteous, the verse must be understood as referring to the world to come, where all Jews will be accounted as righteous.

There we learned that the inhabitants are to be executed by decapitation.  The remainder of chapter ten will discuss various details of this law.  We should note that these laws were certainly not practiced in the time of the Mishnah and Talmud, and according to one opinion in the Talmud there never was such a thing as a city that was judged as having been seduced into idol worship.",

The inhabitants of a city seduced into worshipping idols lose their place in the world to come.  This is learned from the words in the quoted verse, “have gone out from among you”, which is understood by the author of the mishnah to mean that they have left the whole of Israel (clal Yisrael) to whom is promised a portion in the world to come.",

From the words “from among you” the mishnah learns that they must be from the same tribe of Israel.  The mishnah also states that the majority of the city must be seduced in order for it to be deemed a seduced city whose inhabitants are to be decapitated.  It is unclear from which part of the verse the mishnah learns this law.  Since the verse specifically states “men” the mishnah concludes that the seducers must be men. If any of these criteria are not met, i.e. the seducers are women or minors, or a minority of the city is seduced or the seducers are from another city, those who have worshipped idols are judged and sentenced individually.  This means that witnesses are required to testify against each one of them and each one must be warned that if s/he worships idols s/he will be executed.",

Each one receives both a stringency and a leniency.  Individuals are executed by stoning (see chapter 7, mishnah six), a more stringent form of the death penalty, therefore their property is not destroyed and their descendents may receive their inheritance.  Those of a seduced city are executed by decapitation, which is a less stringent form of the death penalty, therefore their property is destroyed and their descendents do not inherit."

However, from the words “doom it”, the Rabbis understand that the Torah is limiting that which is destroyed.

Rabbi Shimon compares this burning with the sacrificial burning of whole burnt offerings (olah).  Although the burning of the spoil of a seduced city is not literally a sacrificial offering, since it is not offered on the altar, and most of the things being burned will not be fit to be offered on the altar, nevertheless Rabbi Shimon states that God will reward those who burn the spoil the same as He rewards those who offer sacrifices.",

Our chapter discusses those who are executed by strangling.  According to the Rabbis anyone whom the Torah states should be executed without stating the form of the execution, is to be executed by strangling, which is the least destructive and probably least painful form of execution.",
                    "<b>The following are strangled: One who strikes his father or mother; One who kidnaps a Jew; An elder who rebels against the ruling of the court; A false prophet; One who prophesies in the name of an idol; One who commits adultery; Witnesses who testified falsely [to the adultery of] a priest’s daughter, and the one who has had sexual relations with her.</b>  As did the mishnah with regards to those executed by stoning, burning and decapitation, so too with regards to strangling the mishnah first lists all of those who are punished by this form of execution.  The mishnah will now proceed, from here to the end of the tractate to go into greater detail with regards to each category.  We will therefore explain each category and its Biblical proof texts as we come to them later in the Mishnah.",
                    "<b>The one who strikes his father or his mother is liable only if he wounds them. In this respect, cursing is more stringent than striking, for one who curses [his/her parents] after death is liable, while one who strikes them after death is not.</b>  Exodus 21:15 teaches that one who strikes either of his parents is liable to the death penalty.  Striking an ordinary person is not a capital crime and is punishable through financial penalties only.  However, striking one’s parent is a form of rebellion against not only society but in essence against God as well.  Therefore the Torah deems it, and cursing one’s parents (Ex. 21:17) to be capital crimes, punishable by death.  Since the Torah does not state how the execution is to be performed, the Rabbis declared that the person is to be strangled. Our mishnah teaches that in order for the child to be guilty of striking he must make a wound.  If the child strikes without causing a wound s/he is not to be executed. The mishnah also teaches that although a child is executed for either striking or cursing one’s parents, there is a stringency with regards to cursing that does not exist with regards to striking.  One who curses is liable even if he curses the parent after death, whereas one who strikes is only liable if the parent was alive when struck.",
                    "<b>One who kidnaps a Jew is not liable unless he brings him onto his own property.

If he kidnaps his own son.   Rabbi Ishmael the son of Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka declares him liable, but the Sages exempt [him]. If he kidnapped one who was half a slave and half free,     Rabbi Judah declares him liable, but the Sages exempt [him].</b>  Exodus 21:16 and Deuteronomy 24:7 both state that one who kidnaps is liable for the death penalty.  Our mishnah defines kidnapping as taking a person and bringing them forcefully onto one’s property.  Just the mere act of taking the person does not constitute the type of kidnapping punishable by death.  Rabbi Judah, basing himself on the verse in Deuteronomy states that even kidnapping and bringing onto one’s property is not punishable by death.  Only if the kidnapper forces the abductee to work as a slave is he to be executed. According to the Rabbi Yishmael the son of Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka, one who kidnaps his own son is not liable as a kidnapper, whereas the Sages say that he is.  Rabbi Yishmael probably assumes that a parents’ authority over their children is so great that categorically the laws of kidnapping cannot apply.  The Sages, representing the majority opinion, limit the parents authority by applying the laws of kidnapping even to one’s own child. The aforementioned verse in Deuteronomy clearly limits the laws of kidnapping to an Israelite who kidnaps another Israelite.  According to all of the Sages in our mishnah, one who kidnaps a non-Jew is not liable for the death penalty.  There is however a dispute with regards to one who is half a slave and half a free Jew (i.e. he was owned by two owners and one freed him while the other did not).  According to Rabbi Judah, the mere fact that he is half a Jew means that the laws of kidnapping do apply to him.

While Jewish learning is usually quite pluralistic, allowing for the existence of many differences of opinions without deeming one to be heretical, there is a theoretical limit to this pluralism.  The high court in Jerusalem was considered to be the final word in all matters.  An ordained teacher who ruled against the high court in a matter of practical law was to be condemned to death.  Since the high court has not existed since the time of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, this law is (for better or for worse) no longer enforceable.",

When they have announced to you the verdict in the case, you shall carry out the verdict that is announced to you from that place that the Lord chose, observing scrupulously all their instructions to you.  You shall act in accordance with the instructions given you and the ruling handed down to you; you must not deviate from the verdict that they announce to you either to the right or to the left.  Should a man act presumptuously and disregard the priest charged with serving there the Lord your God, or the magistrate, that man shall die” (Deut. 17:8-13, JPS.</b>  This section introduces the Biblical prooftext for the category of the rebellious elder.  The Torah mentions one who “acts presumptuously”, ignoring the teaching of the priestly magistrate.   The Torah does not state who this person was, or under what circumstances he disobeyed the authority of our court.  Our mishnah attempts to define this person, giving, interestingly enough, a narrow definition.  This definition will leave much room for a Jew to disagree with even the high court, without allowing total disobedience to its rulings.",

If not, they go to the [second court] which is at the entrance of the Temple court, and he declares, “Thus have I expounded and thus have my colleagues expounded; thus have I taught, and thus have my colleagues taught.” If [this second court] had heard [a ruling on the matter] they state it; if not, they all proceed to the great court of the Chamber of Hewn Stone from whence instruction issued to all Israel, for it says, [you shall carry out the verdict that is announced to you] from that place that the Lord chose (Deut. 17:10).</b>  This section describes the judicial process by which an elder could be brought to the high court. When an elder made a teaching upon which the other elders disagreed he is first brought to the court that sat at the opening of the Temple mount.  The elder is allowed to state how he expounded the Torah or how he taught and how his colleagues expounded or taught.  If this court had heard a ruling with regard to the matter they would decide in the matter.  If not they would send him to the court that sat at the entrance to the Temple court, where the process would be repeated.  If they too had not heard a ruling then they would send him to the highest court, the great court that sat in the Temple in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.  This court would by necessity make a ruling, one that was considered authoritative for all of Israel.",

But if a disciple gave a practical decision [opposed to the court], he is exempt:   thus his stringency is his leniency.</b>  This section lists under what circumstances the elder is to be deemed guilty and therefore executed.  If he continues to teach as he was teaching previously, thereby ignoring the verdict of the high court, but does not tell others to act according to this teaching, he is not guilty.  This is learned from the word “to do” in the verse in Deuteronomy.  One is allowed to disagree with the high court, but not to incite others to act against their rulings. A student, who is never allowed to give practical halachic rulings, who does give a practical halachic ruling, and that ruling is against that of the high court, is also not to be executed.  Since his ruling is not authoritative in any case, because he is only a student, it is not considered to be the type of rebellion punished by death.

An elder who states that there is no commandment of tefillin is not to be executed, since the commandment of tefillin is stated explicitly in the Torah (Exodus 13:9, 16, Deuteronomy 6:8, 11:18).  Anyone who hears this elder teach that there is no tefillin will be able to check the Torah and realize that the elder’s teaching is false.  However, one who states that the tefillin must be made of five boxes, instead of the four prescribed by the Rabbis, is liable for the death penalty. Since the Torah does not state how many boxes are to be in the tefillin, this is a teaching that if we didn’t know from the Rabbis we would not know at all.  Therefore, an elder who teaches against this teaching is more of a threat than the elder who teaches against something stated specifically in the Torah.

There are two opinions in our mishnah with regards to how the execution is to be carried out.  According to Rabbi Akiva, the execution must take place at the high court, where it will receive the most exposure.   Furthermore, it must take place during the festival when Jews would gather at the Temple to celebrate.
