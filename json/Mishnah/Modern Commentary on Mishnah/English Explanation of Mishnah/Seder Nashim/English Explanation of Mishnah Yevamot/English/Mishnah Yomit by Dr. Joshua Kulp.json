            "The laws of levirate marriage are contained in Deuteronomy 25:5-10.  According to these laws, if a husband dies without children, his brother should marry his widow and the first son that she bears shall be “accounted to the dead brother”.  This is in order for the dead brother’s genealogical line to be continued.  If the live brother refuses to marry his dead brother’s widow, she performs a ceremony known in the Mishnah as “halitzah”.  This entails her taking off his shoe and spitting in his face (the rabbis understand this to mean spitting on the ground).  After halitzah, the woman can marry whomever she chooses, as can a normal widow.",
            "There are two instances of levirate marriage in the Tanakh, one involving Judah’s sons and daughter-in-law (Genesis 38) and one involving Ruth and Boaz (see Ruth 3:12 and chapter 4).  Some of the legal details of these instances do not match those of Deuteronomy.  It is sufficient to note that the rabbis follow the laws of Deuteronomy and do not derive the laws of levirate marriage from Genesis or Ruth.  ",
            "There are a few rules that we should explain here in the introduction, in order to make the learning of this sometimes difficult tractate simpler.  First of all, a woman whose husband has died without children is forbidden to marry another man until she has levirate marriage or halitzah.  Second, a man may not perform levirate marriage for a woman who is forbidden to him.  For instance, if two brothers marry two sisters and one dies, the widow is not subject to the laws of levirate marriage, because her sister is married to the levir (a man cannot marry two sisters). Third, both betrothed women and married women are subject to the laws of levirate marriage.  Fourth, levirate marriage is obligatory only for paternal brothers.  ",
            "There is some debate in the Talmud whether or not levirate marriage is currently preferable to halitzah.  In post-Talmudic times, Ashkenazim held that halitzah was mandatory and they abolished levirate marriage.  Certain Sephardi groups continued to practice levirate marriage until the formation of the State of Israel, which has adopted the Ashkenazi position.  Much of these differences can be attributed to the fact that Ashkenazim banned bigamy, while most Sephardim did not.",
            "The following is a list of Hebrew terms and their meaning.  I will use these terms in transliteration because they are less cumbersome.  I suggest you print this page so that you can reference it while we learn the tractate.",
            "<b>Halitzah</b>—release from levirate marriage.",
            "<b>Halutzah</b>—a woman who has performed halitzah.  A priest cannot marry a halutzah.  ",
            "<b>Ma’amar</b>—the giving of money from the yavam to the yavamah, a parallel to the betrothal money given as “kiddushin” in normal marriages.  According to the Torah there is no marital process for the widow who goes through yibbum.  All that really happens is that he has relations with her, and thus yibbum is performed.  However, the rabbis created an institution called “ma’amar” whereby the yavam would give her betrothal money similar to the betrothal money given in regular marriages (we will learn these laws in tractate Kiddushin).  Ma’amar, however, does not make the woman the yavam’s full wife.  The status of their marriage is only rabbinic.  This will have many important implications in certain mishnayoth.",
            "<b>Mamzer</b>—the child of an illicit union or the child of a mamzer.  The Torah states, “A mamzer shall not be admitted into the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:3).  We will see in the mishnah that there are several different opinions as to which type of illicit union creates a mamzer.  A mamzer cannot marry a regular Israelite.  I will not translate mamzer as “bastard”, as it is often translated, because in American lingo a “bastard” is also the child of an unmarried couple.  This is untrue in Jewish law.   ",

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIf a woman’s husband dies without children she is liable for yibbum to her husband’s brother.  However, if she is forbidden to her husband’s brother because of an incest prohibition, she is not liable for yibbum.  Our mishnah teaches which incest prohibitions exempt a woman from being liable for yibbum.  Furthermore, the mishnah teaches that not only is the prohibited woman exempt from yibbum, but all of her rival wives (those who were also married to the dead husband) are exempt from yibbum.  The mishnah states that this exemption is “ad infinitum”.  This means that if one of this woman’s rival wives has yibbum with another brother, one to whom the wife prohibited to the other brother is not prohibited, and then this brother also dies, all of her rival wives from the second marriage are also exempt from yibbum.\nWe will explain each category of forbidden relationships and try to give concrete examples.",
                    "<b>Fifteen [categories of] women exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives and so on ad infinitum from halitzah and from yibbum. And these are they:  (1) his daughter, (2) and the daughter of his daughter, (3) and the daughter of his son, (4) and the daughter of his wife, (5) and the daughter of her son (6) and the daughter of her daughter; (7) His mother-in-law and (8) his mother-in-law’s mother, (9) and his father-in-law’s mother; (10) His maternal sister and (11) his mother’s sister and (12) his wife’s sister (13) And his maternal brother’s wife;  (14) and the wife of his brother who died before he was born, (15) And his daughter-in-law. All these exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives, and so on, ad infinitum, from halitzah and from yibbum. If any of them died, or made a declaration of refusal, or were divorced, or were found incapable of procreation, their rivals are permitted. And you cannot say of a man’s mother-in-law, or the mother of his mother-in-law and of the mother of his father-in-law that they were found incapable of procreation or that they made a declaration of refusal.</b> His daughter:  Reuven and Shimon are brothers.  Shimon marries Reuven’s daughter (this is permitted) and another woman.  If Shimon dies, Reuven cannot perform yibbum with his daughter.  Hence, she and her rival wives are exempt from yibbum or halitzah. And the daughter of his daughter, and the daughter of his son:  These cases are the same as the case above, except Shimon married Reuven’s granddaughter and not his daughter. And the daughter of his wife and the daughter of her son and the daughter of her daughter:  Meaning his wife’s descendents who are not his children.   Even though these women are not blood relatives of his, they are still forbidden to him. His mother-in-law and his mother-in-law’s mother, and his father-in-law’s mother:  In this case Shimon marries Reuven’ wife’s mother, or Reuven’s wife’s maternal or paternal grandmother.  Since these women are all forbidden to Reuven, when Shimon dies without children they and their rival wives are exempt from yibbum. His maternal sister:  Reuven and Shimon are paternal brothers.  Shimon marries Reuven’s maternal sister. This is permitted since she does not share any parent with Shimon.  When Shimon dies, she cannot have yibbum with Reuven, since he is her brother.  Therefore, she and her rival wives are exempt. And his mother’s sister:  Again, Reuven and Shimon are paternal brothers.  Shimon marries Reuven’s mother’s sister, and then dies.  Since she, as Reuven’s aunt, is prohibited to him, she and all of her rival wives are exempt from yibbum. And his wife’s sister:  Reuven and Shimon marry two sisters.  When Shimon dies, Reuven cannot marry his wife’s sister.  This will be the typical case mentioned in many subsequent mishnayoth. And his maternal brother’s wife:  Reuven and Shimon are maternal brothers and Reuven and Levi are paternal brothers.  When Shimon dies Levi marries his widow (not through yibbum).  She is permitted to him since Levi and Shimon are not brothers.  When Levi dies, Reuven should have to do yibbum with his wife.  However, she was originally Shimon’s wife and as Shimon’s wife she would not have had to do yibbum with Reuven, since yibbum is done only with paternal brothers.  Since she was originally married to a man who made her forbidden to Reuven (the general prohibition of marrying your brother’s wife is true for both paternal and maternal brothers), she cannot have yibbum with him even after subsequent marriages. And the wife of his brother who died before he was born:  Reuven marries a woman and dies before Shimon, his brother, is born.  This woman has yibbum with Levi, a different brother.  When Shimon grows up, Levi dies without children.  Since Shimon was not alive when this woman married Reuven, he cannot have yibbum with her (this is learned exegetically from a verse).  She and her rival wives are therefore exempt. And his daughter-in-law:  Reuven and Shimon are brothers.  When Reuven’s son dies, Shimon marries the widow.  When Shimon dies, this woman, who used to be Reuven’s daughter-in-law, becomes liable to yibbum.  Since she is forbidden to him, she and all of her rival wives are exempt. If any of them died, or made a declaration of refusal, or were divorced, or were found incapable of procreation, their rivals are permitted:  If any of these women who were forbidden to the yavam, and therefore were themselves exempt and caused their rival wives to be exempt, were not married at the time of the brother’s death, the rival wives are permitted to have yibbum. The mishnah lists several ways in which the marriage could have been terminated.   The two simplest are death and divorce.  The “declaration of refusal” (me’un), refers to a case where an orphan girl’s marriage was arranged by her mother or brother.  This type of marriage is different from the usual marriage, which is arranged by the father.  Marriage arranged by a mother or brother is only of rabbinic status; therefore the girl has a right to refuse, and thereby annul the marriage upon her reaching majority age.  “Incapable of procreation” (aylonit) refers to a woman who never reaches puberty.  She is clearly female, but never looks like an adult female, i.e. she has no breasts or puberty hair.  [An aylonit is not merely a woman who has not had children.  She must also not look like an adult female.] By definition, this type of woman cannot procreate.  Since she cannot procreate, she is not liable for yibbum.  After all the purpose of yibbum is to have children.  Since she is not subject to the laws of yibbum, the fact that she is prohibited to the yavam does not exempt her rival wives.  In all of these cases, the brother dies after his marriage to the wife forbidden to his brother has already been terminated.   Therefore, the forbidden (former) wives do not exempt their rival wives from yibbum. And you cannot say of a man’s mother-in-law, or the mother of his mother-in-law and of the mother of his father-in-law that they were found incapable of procreation or that they made a declaration of refusal:  The mishnah merely points out that three of the above categories cannot fit two of the possibilities for terminating marriage.  A woman who has already had children (by definition a mother-in-law has had children) cannot be considered “incapable of procreation”.  Nor could she “refuse” a marriage, for refusal of marriage takes place upon reaching majority, and not afterwards."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah is a continuation of the previous and it explains many of the details.",
                    "<b>How do they exempt their rival wives? If his daughter or any other of these forbidden relatives was married to his brother who also had another wife, and he died, then just as his daughter is exempt so is her rival exempt. If his daughter’s rival went and married a second brother of his, who also had another wife, and he died, then just as the rival of his daughter is exempt so is his daughter’s rival’s rival exempt, even if there were a hundred [brothers]. How is it that if they had died, their rivals are permitted? If a man’s daughter or any other of these forbidden relatives was married to his brother who also had another wife, and his daughter died or was divorced, and afterwards his brother died, her rival is permitted. The rival of any one who can make a declaration of refusal but did not make a declaration of refusal, must perform halitzah and may not have yibbum.</b>  This section explains the opening statement of mishnah one, “Fifteen [categories of] women exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives and so on ad infinitum from halitzah and from yibbum”.  For the sake of clarity, I will explain it again here.  Reuven and Shimon are brothers.  Shimon marries Reuven’s daughter.  When Shimon dies without children, Reuven cannot perform yibbum with his own daughter.  Hence, she and all of her rival wives are not liable for yibbum.  If Reuven and Shimon had a third brother, Levi, and Reuven’s daughter’s rival wife married Levi and then Levi died without children, the rival wife is not liable for yibbum with Reuven and neither are any of Levi’s other wives.  This law is true even if there are 100 brothers. As an aside, this mishnah also teaches that if there was a third brother, for whom none of the dead brother’s wives was prohibited, they are liable to have yibbum or halitzah with him. The exemptions are only in a case where Reuven was the only brother.",
                    "This section explains the second section of mishnah one, “If any of them died, or made a declaration of refusal, or were divorced, or were found incapable of procreation, their rivals are permitted.”  If Reuven’s daughter died or was divorced before Shimon, her husband, dies, her rival wives are permitted to have yibbum with Reuven. There is a special rule regarding the wife who could have made a declaration of refusal (meun) but did not.  As we recall, this wife’s marriage, arranged by her brother or mother, is of only rabbinical status (and not biblical).  Her liability to have yibbum is therefore only rabbinic and not biblical.  If she were to refuse the marriage, the rival wives are certainly liable for yibbum.  However, even if she does not, her rival wives are not totally exempt.  They are rabbinically exempt, because the rival wife cannot have yibbum with the yavam, but they are biblically liable, because the rival wife was not biblically married to the brother.  The solution in such a case is for the yavam to perform halitzah.  As we shall see throughout the tractate, in cases of doubt whether or not yibbum should or can be performed, the solution is usually the performance of halitzah, which avoids the possibility of forbidden sexual relations."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nMishnah three introduces a different list of women which is compared to the list in mishnah one.",
                    "<b>There are six relatives that are more restricted than these, in that they may be married only to strangers, marriage with their rivals is permitted:   his mother and his father’s wife, his father’s sister, his paternal sister, his father’s brother’s wife and his paternal brother’s wife.</b> The six women mentioned in this mishnah are considered “more restricted” because they cannot be married to a man’s paternal brother (remember, yibbum is restricted to only paternal brothers).  For instance, a man’s mother cannot marry his paternal brother, because she is the wife of the paternal brother’s father, and it is forbidden to marry your father’s wife.  Likewise, it is forbidden to marry one’s father’s sister, one’s sister (from either parent), one’s father’s brother’s wife or one’s brother’s wife.  This last case can occur when one brother marries a woman and divorces her or dies with children.  This wife is now forbidden to all of her dead or divorced husband’s brothers. In all of these cases, if one of these women was married to another man and their husband died, their rival wives may marry one of the brothers.  The rival wife of a woman forbidden due to kinship is forbidden only when the forbidden women became eligible for yibbum.  These women were never eligible for yibbum to these brothers, therefore their rival wives are permitted.  Furthermore, even if the brother tried to marry one of these women, and then died, the rival wives are eligible for yibbum, since the marriage of the brother to the forbidden woman was not valid."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nMishnah four teaches us that the first three mishnayoth of the tractate were all according the opinion of Beth Hillel.  Whereas Beth Hillel ruled that a woman whose rival wife is forbidden to the yavam is exempt from yibbum (as is the forbidden wife), Beth Shammai ruled that she must have yibbum or halitzah.  The mishnah then lists a few correlating disputes on this matter.\nFinally, the mishnah sounds what is surely the most pluralistic note in the entire Mishnah:  despite their many disagreements, Beth Hillel and Beth Shammai did not separate into two different sects.",
                    "<b>Beth Shammai permits the rival wives to the surviving brothers, and Beth Hillel prohibits them. If they perform the halitzah, Beth Shammai disqualifies them from marrying a priest,  and Beth Hillel makes the eligible. If they performed yibbum, Beth Shammai makes them eligible [to marry a priest],  and Beth Hillel disqualifies them. Though these forbid and these permit, and these disqualify and these make eligible, Beth Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from [the families of] Beth Hillel, nor did Beth Hillel [refrain from marrying women] from [the families of] Beth Shammai. [With regard to] purity and impurity, which these declare pure and the others declare impure, neither of them refrained from using the utensils of the others for the preparation of food that was ritually clean.</b>  I have explained this section above in the introduction.",
                    "If the yavam should perform halitzah with the rival wife, according to Beth Shammai, this halitzah is valid and allows this woman to marry other men.  Since a woman who has had halitzah is prohibited to a priest (just as a divorcee is forbidden to a priest), this woman is now prohibited to marry a priest.  According to Beth Hillel, this was an unnecessary halitzah, for the woman could have married other men even without it.  Since it was not true halitzah, she can still subsequently marry a priest.",
                    "If she has yibbum, full levirate marriage, Beth Shammai would consider this to be valid, as they stated in section one.  Should this marriage end in the husband’s death, she could marry a priest, as can all widows.  However, according to Beth Hillel, this yibbum was actually forbidden.  Therefore this woman can no longer marry a priest, since all women who have engaged in forbidden sex cannot subsequently marry priests (we will learn more about this law later in the tractate).",
                    "In Jewish law the child of many forbidden unions is considered to be a mamzer (we will also learn these laws later in the tractate).   A mamzer cannot marry a regular Israelite (Jew).  In the above dispute, if the rival wife did perform yibbum, the child would be a mamzer according to Beth Hillel.  Since this was not a situation requiring yibbum, the woman was biblically forbidden to her dead husband’s brother.   If the rival wife married another man without yibbum or halitzah, the child of this subsequent marriage would be a mamzer according to Beth Shammai.  This is because this woman married “out” while still bound to her yavam.  This section teaches that although this dispute would have created children considered by some to be mamzers and others not to be, neither side refrained from marrying those from the other side. This is a remarkable note of pluralism in the Mishnah, indeed it seems that this ideology is what kept the rabbis from forming splinter groups.  Although Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel disagreed on many topics, they continued to live together and intermarry.  Unlike other groups, specifically the Dead Sea sect, which left Jerusalem over halakhic disputes with their opponents, the halakhic disputes between the rabbis did not cause them to break into many little groups.  The mishnah further teaches that despite the fact that things that Beth Hillel considered pure, Beth Shammai considered impure, and vice versa, they did not refrain from eating together and from using each other’s utensils.  Again, if we look at the group that did split, the Dead Sea sect, two of the halakhic issues which they considered the most important were marital laws and purity laws (sacrificial laws were also important.)  The authors of the Dead Sea scrolls are constantly accusing their opponents of not properly observing marriage laws or purity laws.  Despite the fact that Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel also debated these subjects, they did not refrain from marrying each other and from eating together.  In other words, they remained one society."

If there were two brothers, and one of them died, and then a third brother was born, and then the second brother had yibbum with his dead brother’s wife and then died himself, the first woman is exempt as the wife of his brother who died before he was born, and the second wife [is exempt] because she is her rival wife. If he had ma’amar with her and died, the second wife, must perform halitzah but may not have yibbum.</b>  Reuven and Shimon are brothers and Shimon dies.  Afterwards, Levi is born.  Reuven then takes Shimon’s widow in yibbum.  Afterwards Reuven also dies without children.  This same widow, who was originally Shimon’s wife and then became Reuven’s wife, now technically should become liable to have yibbum or halitzah with Levi, the third brother. However, since Levi was not yet born when Shimon died, she is not liable for yibbum with Levi.  Since she is exempt, all of her rival wives are exempt as well.",
                    "In order to understand this section, we must remind ourselves that ma’amar is the giving of money from the yavam to the yavamah, a parallel to the betrothal money given as “kiddushin” in regular marriages.  As I explained in the introduction, according to the Torah there is no marital process for the widow who goes through yibbum.  All that really happens is that he has relations with her, and thus yibbum is performed.  However, the rabbis created an institution called “ma’amar” whereby the yavam would give her betrothal money similar to the betrothal money given in regular marriages (we will learn these laws in tractate Kiddushin).  Ma’amar, however, does not make the woman the yavam’s full wife.  The status of their marriage is only rabbinic.  This will have many important implications in future mishnayoth. In our mishnah, Reuven does not have full yibbum with the woman, but only does ma’amar, and then dies.  The woman therefore, is not biblically liable to have yibbum with Levi, the third brother, but only rabbinically liable.  Since she is only rabbinically liable, her rival wife is not truly exempt, and according to biblical law she could have yibbum.  However, since Reuven did perform ma’amar with the other wife, the rival wife can only have halitzah."

If he had ma’amar with her, the second wife must perform the halitzah but she may not have yibbum. Rabbi Shimon says: he may have yibbum with either of them or perform halitzah for either of them.</b>  The scenario in this mishnah is only slightly different from that in the previous one.  Again, Reuven and Shimon are brothers.  Shimon dies and in this case Reuven has yibbum with Shimon’s wife even before Levi is born.  In the previous mishnah Levi was born and then Reuven had yibbum with Shimon’s wife.  When Reuven dies, his wife who had previously been married to Shimon is exempt from yibbum with Levi because she is “the wife of his brother who died before he was born”.  The rival wife is again, also exempt.  The innovation of this mishnah is that even though when Levi was born, the woman was no longer waiting to have yibbum, in other words she was at the time a regular wife to Reuven and not a shomeret yavam, and Reuven did not die before Levi was born, in any case she is forbidden to Levi because he was not yet born when Shimon died.",
                    "If  Reuven had ma’amar with the woman and then died, according to the first opinion, the ruling is the same as it was in the previous mishnah.  Since she is only partially Reuven’s wife, she does not fully exempt her rival wife from yibbum.",

Shimon disagrees with the previous opinion and rules that in the case under discussion in this mishnah, either the wife who was formerly married to Shimon or the rival wives may have yibbum or halitzah.  Since Levi was born when the woman was no longer a shomeret yavam, all connection she had to Shimon is lost.  She only becomes liable for yibbum because of her marriage with Reuven, and Levi was born before Reuven died (unlike Shimon).  Therefore, according to R. Shimon, Levi must have halitzah or yibbum with either wife.  In other words this is only a normal case of a man’s wives becoming liable for yibbum.

If her sister is also her sister-in-law, she may perform halitzah or have yibbum.</b>  This general rule has been amply illustrated in the previous chapter and a half.  If the yavamah was prohibited to her yavam according to the biblical laws of incest, she may not perform halitzah nor have yibbum.

Tomorrow’s mishnah will explain what both of these categories are.  Suffice it now to say that they are less consequential than the biblical incest prohibitions mentioned in the previous section.  If a woman who is prohibited to her yavam in one of these ways should be liable for yibbum, she must perform halitzah but may not have yibbum.  This is another way of stating that she is biblically liable for yibbum, but to avoid the problems that this type of yibbum would cause, the only option is halitzah.",

I will illustrate this complicated situation using names.  Reuven, Shimon and Levi are brothers.  Leah and Rachel are sisters.  Leah marries Reuven and Shimon marries Rachel, and then both men die without children.  Levi is married to Rachel’s daughter (from a marriage before she married Shimon).  Levi can therefore not have yibbum with Rachel, since a man cannot marry a woman and her daughter.  Nevertheless, Levi can have yibbum with Leah.  Although in general a man cannot have yibbum with the sister of his yavamah (we will learn this in chapter three), in this case since Rachel was forbidden to him, she was never his yavamah.  Therefore, Leah is permitted."

A widow to a high priest:  If a widow becomes liable for yibbum to a high priest, he must perform halitzah for her.  He cannot have yibbum with her because she is prohibited to him (Leviticus 21:14). A divorced woman or one that had performed halitzah to a regular priest:  If a previously divorced woman or a woman who had halitzath, should become liable for yibbum with a regular priest, she must perform halitzah and cannot have yibbum, since she is prohibited to him (Leviticus 21:7). Note that this situation will usually not happen because a divorced woman or one who had halitzah cannot marry a priest, and therefore, she should not have married the yavam’s (who is a priest) brother, who is also a priest.  Nevertheless, if the brother transgressed and did marry a divorcee (marriage between a priest and a divorcee is prohibited but valid), and then died, the divorcee (who is now also a widow) has halitzah with the brother but not yibbum. A mamzereth or a netinah to an Israelite and an Israelite woman to a natin or a mamzer:  A mamzer (or mamzereth, a female mamzer) is the child of a forbidden union (Deuteronomy 23:3.  The definition of a mamzer appears in chapter 4:13).  A natin (or a netinah, a female natin) is a descendent of a tribe of foreigners who converted through trickery in the days of Joshua and were declared temple slaves (Joshua 9:27).  Neither of these categories of men or women can marry full Israelites.  Therefore, if one of these people becomes liable to have yibbum with an Israelite, or if an Israelite becomes liable to have yibbum with one of them, they have halitzah and not yibbum."

In contrast, if he is suspected of having an affair with a married woman, and then she is forced to separate from her husband, and the suspected adulterer marries her, the court imposes a divorce.  Adultery is a much more serious crime than relations with non-Jews and therefore just a suspicion that he had adultery with her, rules out all future marriages.

Therefore, if both women should become liable for yibbum with the surviving brother, he may not have yibbum with either, because each one is the relative of his z’kukah (the other woman who becomes liable for yibbum).

Just as we have learned before that one cannot marry the sister of a z’kukah, here we learn that one cannot marry the mother, daughter, grandmother or granddaughter of a z’kukah. Rabbi Shimon holds that since he cannot have yibbum with either one of them, neither are even obligated for yibbum.",

                    "<b>Three brothers, two of whom were married to two sisters and the third was unmarried: When one of the sisters’ husbands died, the unmarried brother performed for her ma’amar, and then his second brother died: Beth Shammai says: his wife [remains] with him while the other is exempt because she is his wife’s sister. Beth Hillel however says that he must divorce his wife with a get and by halitzah,   and his brother’s wife by halitzah. This is the case in regard to which they said: “woe to him because of his wife, and woe to him because of his brother’s wife.”</b> Reuven and Shimon were married to Rachel and Leah, and Levi was unmarried.  When Reuven dies, Levi performed ma’amar with Rachel.  Ma’amar, as we have learned before, is an act parallel to betrothal with a regular woman, and is only done in the case of yibbum.  Ma’amar is performed by the man giving a symbolic amount of money to the woman.  Rachel becomes his quasi-fiancee after having ma’amar, but she is not fully his wife until he performs yibbum (intercourse).  Before Levi can have yibbum with Rachel, Shimon also dies, thereby making Leah liable for yibbum.  The question is now asked, can Levi continue to stay married to Rachel, even though he is liable to have yibbum with Rachel’s sister. According to Beth Shammai, the first woman (Rachel) remains Levi’s wife and Leah is exempt from either yibbum or halitzah.  In other words, Beth Shammai sees in ma’amar a full marital act, one which makes Rachel Levi’s full wife.  Since he is already married to Rachel, he cannot have yibbum with Leah, Rachel’s sister, and she is completely exempt. According to Beth Hillel, ma’amar does not make Rachel into a full wife, such that it would be biblically forbidden for Levi to marry her sister.  Therefore, when Leah becomes obligated for yibbum, it is the case of two sisters who are both liable to have yibbum with the same man.  As we have learned previously, in such a case both must have halitzah, and neither may have yibbum, since a man cannot marry the sister of his z’kukah.  In addition, Rachel requires a get, since she did have ma’amar, which is an act of betrothal. The final clause of the mishnah relates that it is about such a case that people say, woe to him for losing his wife and woe to him for losing his brother’s wife.  For without having done anything wrong, both of these women are prohibited to him."

We should note that there are other cases of doubtful divorce and betrothal that we will learn when we learn tractates Gittin and Kiddushin.

If a woman were to get remarried using one of these divorce documents, the children from the second marriage are not mamzers (as they would be if she remarried without ever being divorced).

                    "<b>Three brothers were married to three women who were strangers [to one another] and one of them died and the second brother did ma’amar with her and then he died, behold, these must perform halitzah but may not be taken in yibbum; for it is said “And one of them died…her husband’s brother shall unite with her” (Deuteronomy 25:5) only she who is bound due to one yavam but not she who is bound to due to two yavamim. R. Shimon says: he may have yibbum with whichever of these he wishes and then perform halitzah for the other. If two brothers were married to two sisters, and one of the brothers died, and afterwards the wife of the second brother died, behold, she is forbidden to him   forever, since she was forbidden to him for one moment.</b>  Reuven, Shimon and Levi are married to Rachel, Tovah and Yael, none of whom are sisters.  Reuven dies and Shimon does ma’amar with Rachel.  When Shimon dies, Rachel and Tovah should, we would think, become liable for yibbum r halitzah with Levi.  Our mishnah, using a midrash based on Deut. 25:5, states that neither woman may have yibbum with Levi.  This is because Rachel is bound to Levi through her marriage to two of Levi’s brothers.  She is still bound to him by force of her marriage with Reuven, because the ma’amar that Shimon did with her was not as strong as a full yibbum.  [If Shimon had done yibbum, her ties to Reuven would have been fully severed.]   She is bound to Levi through her marriage to Shimon because of the ma’amar she did do with him.  In other words ma’amar is strong enough to create a relationship with the second brother, but not strong enough to sever the ties with the first brother.  Therefore Rachel is bound to Levi through the force of her marriage to two brothers who are now deceased.  The mishnah understands the words “And one of them died” to exclude a case where two brothers died.  Since Rachel is exempt, her rival wife, Tovah, is also exempt.  However, since ma’amar is not a biblical institution, and therefore the ties to Shimon are not complete, halitzah must be performed.",
                    "Rabbi Shimon holds that ma’amar either completely acquires the woman for the man who does ma’amar, in other words it creates a complete and valid relationship according to the Torah, or it doesn’t create any legal relationship whatsoever, not even a rabbinicly ordained marriage.  If it creates a complete betrothal, then Rachel’s ties to her first husband, Reuven, are ended by Shimon’s ma’amar.  When Shimon dies, she becomes liable to yibbum with Levi only because of her marriage to Shimon.  If it doesn’t create any tie, then she was never at all married to Shimon, and she is liable for yibbum with Levi only because of her marriage to Reuven.  In either case, she does not fit the category of one who is liable to yibbum through two dead husbands at the same time.  Therefore, either of these wives may have yibbum.  The second wife must have halitzah, lest the ma’amar not have created a tie with Shimon, and therefore Rachel became obligated for yibbum because of her marriage with Reuven and Tovah became obligated because of her marriage with Shimon.  He cannot have yibbum with the second one as well, lest the ma’amar did create a tie, and a yavam cannot have yibbum with two wives of one dead husband.",

Reuven dies and Rachel then would become liable for yibbum with Shimon, except she is exempt because he is married to her sister.  The mishnah teaches that even though Leah subsequently dies, and hence Rachel might be able to have yibbum with Shimon, she cannot because she was at one point forbidden to him.

The rabbis also developed a theory that there were two different types of pregnancies:  a seven month and a nine month.

                    "<b>Introduction</b> In order to understand this mishnah, we must understand some background laws concerning a woman’s ownership of property, her dowry and her ketubah. When a man marries a woman he writes her a ketubah (a marriage document).  In the ketubah is written the amount of money he will pay her upon divorce or his death.  Additionally, some of the dowry that the woman brings into the marriage is written in the ketubah. Dowry can come in two forms.  The first form is called “pluckable property” (nikhse melog).  This is money that she brings from her father’s house that remain hers and the husband may not use.  The husband has rights to the profit earned from this money during the marriage.  He has no responsibility for the money.  For instance, if she brings in a piece of land, the land is hers but the husband may use the fruits of the land.  If the land should be taken by the Romans, he is not responsible to pay his wife the value of the land.  Money that she receives as a gift or as an inheritance is part of this category. The second form is “property of iron sheep” (nikhse tzon barzel).  This is written in the ketubah and hence the husband has responsibility for it, should the property be lost, stolen or destroyed.  The husband may use the property.  His sole responsibility is to return the value of the original property upon death or divorce. A wife may not sell either of these types of property without her husband’s permission.  Neither may a husband sell the first type of dowry without his wife’s permission, since it is still hers.  He may however sell “property of iron sheep”. Our mishnah discusses the status of the shomeret yavam, a widow who is waiting for her yavam to do yibbum or halitzah.",
                    "<b>If a shomeret yavam came into possession of money: Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel agree that she may sell it or give it away, and that her act is legally valid.</b>  Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel agree that a shomereth yavam can sell new property that has come into her hands since the death of her first husband.  She does not need the permission of the yavam, because he has not married her.",
                    "<b>If she dies, what shall be done with her ketubah and with property that comes in and goes out with her? Beth Shammai says: the heirs of her husband are to share it with the heirs of her father; Beth Hillel says: the property is to remain with those in whose possession it is, the ketubah is to remain in the possession of the heirs of the husband and the property which comes in and goes out with her remains in the possession of the heirs of her father.</b>  If she dies, there is a dispute between the two houses concerning her inheritance.  Usually a husband inherits his wife, but in this case she only had a yavam who had not yet performed yibbum.  He is not fully her husband. Beth Shammai holds that the heirs of her husband, meaning the yavam who inherits from his dead brother, splits the money with the heirs of her father.  The heirs of the father inherit since an unmarried woman is inherited by her father. Beth Hillel does not split the money evenly.  Rather, each part of the inheritance remains where it is presumed to be.  Since the ketubah, meaning the money paid from the husband to the wife upon death or divorce, is still with the husband’s estate, the husband’s inheritors collect this money.  Additionally, the “property of iron sheep” is in her husband’s possession since he has full ownership over it.  Therefore, the husband’s owners collect this as well.  [This is Albeck’s explanation.  The talmud explains that “property of iron sheep” is split between the husband’s and father’s inheritors.] The “pluckable property” is in the wife’s possession, since the husband cannot sell it.  Therefore the wife’s father’s inheritors inherit this property."

The other brothers should not perform yibbum until their elder brothers have declined the opportunity. However, as we learned there, if a younger brother does perform yibbum before the older brother has a chance to accept or decline, his yibbum is valid. If the eldest brother does not want to perform yibbum, all of the other brothers are given the opportunity, in order of their age. If they all do not wish to perform yibbum, they (perhaps referring to a court) return to the eldest brother and tells him that he must either perform yibbum or halitzah.

She has the right to be released now, so that she can go and marry whomever she wants. Similarly, if one of the younger brothers wants to wait for an older brother to return from abroad, or recover from deafness or from being an imbecile (this may be some sort of temporary insanity), they do not listen to him and force him to do yibbum or halitzah immediately.

The mishnah teaches that only the brother who performs halitzah is forbidden from marrying her relatives.  The other brothers of the deceased brother are not forbidden, since once halitzah has been performed their ties to her have been severed. The halutzah is forbidden to marry his relatives as well.  These include his father and grandfathers, his son and grandsons, and his brother and his brother’s son. Note that most of these relatives would have been forbidden to her because of her marriage to the first brother.

Leah, Rachel’s sister was married to Chaim who is not related to Shimon.  Chaim has another wife named Chana.  Then Chaim dies.

Rabbi Yose said: all [married] women may be betrothed [immediately] with the exception of the widow because of her mourning.</b>  The mishnah now broadens its scope and says that all widows and divorcees should not remarry within three months, again so that it is clear whose child the new baby is.  Note that in these cases the only issue is inheritance and status of the child (i.e. is the child a kohen). There are now three opinions in the mishnah as to which women must wait three months.  According to the first opinion, all women, even if they were merely betrothed must wait three months.  Although generally betrothed women should not have had sexual relations with their husbands, and hence it should be clear that the pregnancy with her new husband is from him, she should still wait.  The idea may be that in order not to create confusion, all women wait an equal period. According to Rabbi Judah a woman who was divorced or widowed from a full marriage may be betrothed within three months, because betrothal does not usually entail sexual relations.  A woman who was divorced or widowed from betrothal may even be married within three months for the same reason.  The only exception is the betrothed woman in Judea.  According to this source and Mishnah Ketuboth 1:5, there was a suspicion that in Judea men might have relations with their betrothed wives before proper marriage.  Therefore in Judea the betrothed woman is treated like a married woman and she must wait. Rabbi Yose says that all women may be betrothed within three months, but not widows.  The reason that widows have to wait (and divorcees do not) is not in order to recognize whose child the new baby is, but because the widow cannot even be betrothed while mourning.  We can see in this mishnah that betrothal was seen to be a joyous occasion and that they probably would celebrate it with a party.  The Talmud states that this period is one month.  Hence divorcees can be betrothed immediately and widows must wait a month.  Of course, both would have to wait three months for proper marriage."

Rabbi Akiva’s opinion is the strictest:  any forbidden union of an incestuous nature creates a mamzer.  This would preclude only forbidden unions that are not incestuous, such as a kohen and a divorcee. Shimon the Yemenite (who is not called rabbi) holds that any forbidden union punishable by kareth creates a mamzer.  Shimon the Yemenite rejects Rabbi Akiva and holds that forbidden unions that are merely prohibited but not punishable by kareth or death do not create mamzers.  An example of such a case is a shomeret yavam who gets remarried to an outsider without first having yibbum or halitzah with her yavam.  According to Rabbi Akiva the child of such a marriage is a mamzer and according to Shimon the Yemenite the child is not.  Interestingly, the mishnah explicitly states that the halakhah is according to this view.  This is one of the few times that the Mishnah makes such a remark. Rabbi Joshua is even more lenient concerning the creation of mamzers.  Only a union punishable by death creates mamzers. Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai claims that he found a scroll of genealogical records in which it was recorded that So-and-so was a mamzer because he was the son of an adulterous affair, which is punishable by death.

However, the Sages decreed that the yavam should first perform “ma’amar”, an act whereby he betroths her, either by money or by a document, the same way betrothal is enacted with other women.  After ma’amar then the couple would have yibbum, enacted by sexual intercourse.\n2) A shomeret yavam’s ties to her yavam are biblically severed only through halitzah.  However, the Sages decreed that if the yavam gives her a get, while it does not exempt her from halitzah, it makes the performance of yibbum forbidden.  In other words it does in some sense sever the tie, thereby making her forbidden due to the prohibition of marrying a brother’s wife.  Furthermore, after giving her a get he is forbidden to marry her rival wives, as are the rest of the brothers.  He is also forbidden to marry any of her relatives.  She is forbidden to marry a priest, as are all divorcees.\n3) If the yavam performed ma’amar and then changes his mind and doesn’t want to have yibbum with her, he must give her a get and perform halitzah.  The get severs the ties created by ma’amar and the halitzah performs its usual function of exempting her from yibbum.",
                    "This mishnah is formulated in classic mishnaic style.  It is terse, somewhat cryptic, easy to remember, and most importantly, it packs a lot of information into only a few words.  Our job in explaining the mishnah will be to “unpack” it and decipher each clause. There is no [validity] to a get given after a get:  If two women are widowed from one brother and both become liable for yibbum with one yavam and he gives the first one a get and then the second one a get, the get that was given to the second woman is meaningless and she is not considered to be a divorcee. As we stated in the above introduction, according to biblical law, a shomeret yavam does not receive a get.  However the Sages decreed that a get is sufficient to make the other rival wives forbidden to the yavam and to make yibbum forbidden with the one who received the get.  Since the second woman to receive the get is not a divorcee, the yavam may subsequently marry her relatives, and she may subsequently marry a priest. Nor to a ma’amar after a ma’amar:  If one yavam does ma’amar to both of the women who become liable to him for yibbum, or two yavamim do ma’amar with one women who became liable for yibbum with either of them, the second ma’amar is meaningless.  Although ma’amar is only of rabbinic origin, its strength is sufficient to render the acquisition of the yevamah as final.  The second wife then received a meaningless ma’amar, for she was no longer liable for yibbum.  Similarly, the second yavam performed a meaningless ma’amar for the woman was no longer available. Nor to an act of sexual intercourse after another act of sexual intercourse:  If one yavam had intercourse, that is, an act of yibbum, with two yevamoth, the second act does not make that yevamah his wife.  It is merely licentious sexual relations, for the woman is no longer liable for yibbum after her rival wife has had yibbum.  She would not need a get in order to remarry. Nor to a halitzah after another halitzah:  Whether one yavam performed halitzah for two yevamoth, or two yevamim performed halitzah for one yevamah, the second act of halitzah is meaningless, for the first act already severed all ties.  The result is that the second woman to receive halitzah is not considered to be a halutzah.",
                    "<b>However, the Sages say:  There is [validity] to a get given after a get, and to a ma’amar after a ma’amar but not to an act of sexual intercourse after another act of sexual intercourse, or to a halitzah after another halitzah.</b>  The Sages disagree with the first two parts of Rabban Gamaliel’s statement.  They hold that a yevamah who receives a get is not like one who has had halitzah.  Since the one who receives a get still needs halitzah, the second get also has some validity.  The fact that the second woman to receive a get is in some sense his divorcee, means that he cannot marry her relatives.  She also could not subsequently marry a kohen.  Similarly, the Sages hold that ma’amar does not acquire like yibbum.  Since one who has been given ma’amar still needs yibbum to complete her becoming his wife, the second ma’amar does have some validity.  The second woman to receive ma’amar would need a get to remarry, and the one who gave her ma’amar is subsequently forbidden to marry her relatives. In brief, we can see in this mishnah a debate concerning the power of rabbinic decrees.  According to Rabban Gamaliel, the rabbinically decreed ma’amar and get for the yevamah are almost as strong as the biblically ordained yibbum and halitzah.  According to the Sages, they are substantially weaker."

If done at the beginning, the yevamah becomes his full wife and any act done afterwards is meaningless with regard to the laws of yibbum.  In other words, after yibbum she becomes his normal wife. However, if the intercourse is done after another act, such as giving her a get or doing ma’amar with a rival wife, there is potential validity to subsequent acts.  For instance, if he gives her a get it is now forbidden for him to have yibbum with her but she still needs halitzah, since the get does not sever the ties created by the necessity for yibbum.  If he now goes ahead and has intercourse with her, she still needs halitzah, for the intercourse was an invalid act of yibbum.  Even though the get was only of a “derabbanan” status, since only halitzah can biblically exempt the woman, the subsequent act of yibbum is still invalid.  The halitzah required after this failed act of yibbum means that “there is validity to an act after intercourse” if it is not the first act performed. According to Rabbi Nehemiah, it does not matter when the act of yibbum was performed, there is never validity to any subsequent act.  Even if the yavam gave her a get before he did yibbum, the yibbum is still valid and she does not need halitzah.  Rabbi Nehemiah holds that since the get makes it forbidden only “derabbanan” to have yibbum, the yibbum is biblically valid and therefore exempts the woman from a need for yibbum. The deeper argument between Rabbi Nehemiah and the sages is over the validity of rabbinicly decreed laws.  According to the sages the rabbinic prohibition of having yibbum after having given a get, makes the yibbum invalid.  According to Rabbi Nehemiah, since the get is only derabbanan, it does not have the power to invalidate the yibbum, which is of biblical status."

The word “betulah” can also mean, young, unmarried girl.  It was probably assumed that most prepubescent, unmarried girls were also physiological virgins.  Incidentally, in Greek literature, virgin was also not used the same way that modern English uses the word virgin.  It could also denote a young, unmarried girl.  In any case, since the Torah states that he must marry a “betulah” the sages rule that he may not marry a girl who has reached puberty, which is actually six months after the first physical signs of maturation. The common age for this is 12 ½.  Before this, by legal definition a girl could not reach puberty.  Meaning, even if she did it was not considered to be statuary puberty. According to Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, the high priest may marry a post-pubescent girl.  According to their definition, a betulah is defined as one who still is physiologically a virgin.  Since this girl is, the high priest may marry her.  However, he may not marry one who has lost her physical signs of virginity in any way, even not through sexual intercourse.

Although she was a widow, he was still allowed to bring her into marriage.

This section teaches that if a shomeret yavam became liable for yibbum with an ordinary priest, and then he became high priest, even if he did ma’amar, he cannot marry her.  Although in the above section we saw that if an ordinary priest had betrothed a woman and then been appointed high priest he could marry her, since ma’amar is only of rabbinic status (and not biblical as is regular betrothal), it does not create enough of a tie to allow him to marry her.

But the Sages said: the term zonah implies only a female convert, freed slavewoman   and one who has been subjected to illicit intercourse.</b> A woman incapable of procreation is called an “aylonit”.  The definition of “aylonit” is a woman who has never developed signs of sexual maturity.  In other words, an aylonit is not a woman who looks like a sexually mature woman but has not succeeded in becoming pregnant. Rather an aylonit is a woman, who is clearly a woman and not a man, but who never hit puberty.  An ordinary priest cannot marry her, and according to the Talmud, even a regular Israelite cannot marry her, unless he has already fulfilled the commandment of procreation.  The reason that the mishnah teaches that an ordinary priest cannot marry her and does not say that no one can marry her, is that Rabbi Judah holds that an ordinary priest cannot marry her even if he has a wife and children.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah the problem with the aylonit is that she cannot procreate.  Therefore, a person can only marry her if he has already fulfilled the mitzvah of procreation or has another wife, with whom he may potentially fulfill the mitzvah.  According to Rabbi Judah, the aylonit is categorized as a “zonah”, who is always forbidden to a priest, even if he already has children or another wife.  She is a “zonah”, for the priest married her knowing that she could not procreate. The Sages disagree and claim that an aylonit is not a zonah.  The Sages define a zonah as a female convert, a freed slavewoman or a woman who has had illicit intercourse.  The first two are forbidden under the assumption that they had relations with Gentiles or slaves before conversion or manumission.  Although that intercourse was permitted at the time, it still renders them off-limits to the priest.

Beth Shammai says: two males, And Beth Hillel says: male and a female, for it says, “Male and female created he them” (Genesis 5:2).</b>  The point that this line in the mishnah is trying to make can be read in two subtly different ways.  It may be that the point of the line is to teach that there is an obligation to procreate.  In other words, without this directive people may have thought (and in ancient Judaism some sects did think) that God preferred people to be celibate and to forego children.  Judaism teaches the opposite.  Sexual relations are generally viewed in a positive light and having children is positive commandment. The other way to read the line, is that it is taken for granted that a person is obligated to procreate.  The innovation of our mishnah is that a man does not need to keep on having children as long as possible.  Once he has had two children, he may desist from procreation.  Understanding the line this way, we would have a different view of the mishnah.  Although it is still considered a commandment to procreate, a person might fulfill that mitzah with only two children and then devote his life to other things, such as the study of Torah.  We should note that in any case, the Talmud teaches that even if a man has children he should remain married for marriage is a preferred state. Beth Shammai holds that a person needs two male children to have fulfilled the requirement.  In the Talmud this is learned from a precedent set by Moses, who had two children and then separated from his wife (according to a midrash). From the story of the creation, where man and woman were created together, Beth Hillel learns that a person needs both a male and a female child to have fulfilled the mitzvah.",

If a man is married to a woman and for ten years they do not succeed in having children, he must either marry another wife or divorce the first wife and marry another wife.  When bigamy was prohibited, only the second option remained.  Note that the mishnah is rather lenient.  Ten years is a long time to attempt to have children.  The mishnah gives the couple the benefit of the doubt.  Furthermore, the woman who could not succeed in having children with one man, is allowed to remarry.  We might have thought that there would be an assumption of infertility.  The mishnah fully realizes that the infertility might have been a problem with the man.  Finally, if she has a miscarriage, the ten years begin to be counted again.  Although the child was not even born, we have seen that the woman can get pregnant and that perhaps she will someday be able to have a viable child. I should also note, that although this halakhah is still on the books, it is not observed.  Even ultraorthodox couples do not divorce if they don’t succeed in having children.  The halakhah is simply ignored.",

Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says: Concerning both of them it is said, “And God blessed them; and said to them… “Be fruitful and multiply” (Genesis 1:28).</b>  According to the first opinion, only men are obligated to procreate.  Rabbi Yohanan ben Baroka says that both men and women are obligated equally.  We should note that although the first opinion sounds very chauvinistic, and it somewhat is, not being obligated to have children does free a woman to be more in control over her own reproductive process.  Certainly the laws of birth control are more lenient if she is not obligated to have children. There is some excellent secondary literature on this issue.  Judith Hauptman has a chapter on the topic in her book, “Rereading the Rabbis”.  David Feldman’s book, “Birth Control in Jewish Law” also discusses the topic."

Our mishnah discusses the issue of slaves brought into a marriage by the wife as part of her dowry, in a case where the marriage was against the halakhah and therefore she herself cannot eat terumah.<br>When we learned mishnah 4:3, we discussed the terms “tzon barzel” and “melog” or “pluckable property”. This is what I wrote there:<br>Dowry can come in two forms.  The first form is called “pluckable property” (nikhse melog).  This is money that she brings from her father’s house that remain hers and the husband may not use.  The husband has rights to the profit earned from this money during the marriage.  He has no responsibility for the money.  For instance, if she brings in a piece of land, the land is hers but the husband may use the fruits of the land.  If the land should be taken by the Romans, he is not responsible to pay his wife the value of the land.  Money that she receives as a gift or as an inheritance is part of this category.<br>The second form is “property of iron sheep” (nikhse tzon barzel).  This is written in the ketubah and hence the husband has responsibility for it, should the property be lost, stolen or destroyed.  The husband may use the property.  His sole responsibility is to return the value of the original property upon death or divorce.<br>Section one:  In the case of our mishnah, a woman who is not allowed to marry a kohen, nevertheless goes ahead and marries him.  When she has intercourse with him, she becomes a halalah, a woman profaned from the priesthood, and she can no longer eat terumah, neither in her husband’s home nor in her father’s (if he was a kohen).  Since she can no longer eat terumah, her slaves can also no longer eat terumah.  The mishnah teaches that since tzon barzel slaves belong more to her husband than they do to her, they may eat terumah.  Melog slaves, who belong more to her than to him, cannot eat terumah.<br>Section two:  This section discusses the difference between melog and tzon barzel slaves. Melog slaves belong to the woman, although while the marriage is still going they work for the husband.  The fact that they belong to the woman means that if they die it is her loss, and if they go up in value, it is her gain.  Despite the fact that the husband must maintain them with food, clothing and shelter, they still belong to the woman.  Since she cannot eat terumah due to her forbidden marriage, they too cannot eat terumah.<br>In contrast, tzon barzel slaves belong to the husband, and his only obligation is to pay their value back to the woman upon the termination of the marriage through death or divorce.  If they die, he must still pay back the value.  If they appreciate in value, it is his profit.  Since he is responsible for their worth, meaning that if something happens to them he must pay back the woman for the loss, they may eat terumah.<br>In summary, the mishnah defines ownership by who profits or loses when the value of the slaves rises or falls. The obligation to maintain the slaves does not cause the husband to be the owner."

After all, in either case we could explain that a fetus disqualifies tzon barzel slaves from eating terumah. The difficulty with this section is whether or not the rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yose.  According to a literal reading of the mishnah they only point out a consequence of Rabbi Yose’s halakhah, without expressing their opinion on the matter.  However, it would seem that they only point this out if they disagree with Rabbi Yose.  According to the Talmud, the rabbis do disagree with Rabbi Yose.

For instance, if a priest dies and leaves his wife pregnant, the fetus does not allow her to eat terumah. If he was an Israelite and she was the daughter of a priest, the fetus disqualifies her from eating terumah. When the daughter of an Israelite is betrothed to a priest she does not yet begin to eat terumah.  However, if she is the daughter of a priest betrothed to an Israelite she already loses the right to eat terumah. A deaf-mute cannot contract marriage, according to Torah law.  This is because he is not considered to have intelligence.  [As a side note, now that sign language has been developed this concept no longer exists.]  The status of his marriage is only derabbanan (of rabbinic origin).  If he is a priest he does not allow his wife to eat terumah, but if he is an Israelite he disqualifies her from eating terumah. Intercourse with a boy less than nine years and one day of age is not considered real intercourse.  The mishnah teaches that once the boy reaches this age, if he has intercourse with a woman forbidden to him, he disqualifies her from eating terumah.  However, if he is a priest, he does not cause her to be able to eat terumah, since a boy who has not reached puberty (concretized by the appearance of two pubic hairs) cannot contract betrothal or marriage.",

The mishnah illustrates some of these principles.  If an Israelite has intercourse with the daughter of a priest, whether that intercourse was rape or seduction (which means she consented), she continues to eat terumah.  Only betrothal to an Israelite would disqualify her from eating terumah.  However, if she becomes pregnant she loses her right to eat terumah.  This is what we learned in the previous mishnah:  a fetus can disqualify from eating terumah.  If she should miscarry, she may resume eating terumah. If a priest has relations with the daughter of an Israelite, the intercourse does not allow her to eat terumah.  In this case only full marriage will allow her to eat terumah.  If she becomes pregnant she still does not eat terumah.  This is because a fetus does not allow a woman to eat terumah.  However, if she gives birth she can eat terumah.  In this way, the power of the son is greater than the father, because the son allows her to eat terumah whereas the father did not. There are two other notes that we need to make on this section.  An insane person cannot contract betrothal.  Therefore, if he is a priest, his betrothal does not allow the wife to eat terumah.  However, if he is an Israelite he does not disqualify the daughter of a priest from eating terumah. If any of these people were “forbidden from entering the assembly of Israel”, meaning they were mamzerim or netinim or another category of people forbidden from marrying Israelites (see Deuteronomy 22:2-4), they do disqualify the woman from eating terumah.",

As a side note, the opening line states that if a woman has intercourse with a slave she is disqualified from eating terumah, since this is forbidden intercourse. If a woman has a son, and the son goes and has intercourse with a slave-woman, the child is a slave.  This is because of the matrilineal principle.  If the grandmother was the daughter of an Israelite married to a priest, and her husband and son die, the grandson does not bestow upon his grandmother the right to eat terumah.

If a woman has relations with a mamzer, she is disqualified from eating terumah, because this is forbidden relations.  However, if a woman has a mamzer as a grandson, he may cause her to eat terumah.  We will now explain. If a woman has a daughter and the daughter goes and is married to a slave or Gentile, the son born of such a marriage is a mamzer.  [Note, that this halakhah was not accepted by many sages in the Talmud.  Today such a child is not considered a mamzer].  If the grandmother was a daughter of an Israelite and she was married to a priest, and her husband and son die, the grandson does bestow upon his grandmother the right to eat terumah.  This is because he is an Israelite, although he is a mamzer.  However, if the grandmother was the daughter of a priest married to an Israelite, and her son and husband die, she does goes back to her father’s house to eat terumah.  Again, the grandson who is Jewish, does effect her right to eat terumah.

When she has a daughter and the daughter goes and marries a priest and has a son the son is a priest and is eligible to become a high priest.  If his father dies, his mother may continue to eat terumah, because she has had a son.  If his mother also dies, and his grandmother did not have any other children, she does not return to her father’s home (remember her father was a priest) to eat terumah, because she has a grandson through her marriage to the Israelite.

The mishnah lists the consequences of her now having unwittingly committed adultery.\nThe usual interpretation of this mishnah is that the marriage to the second husband was not valid, since a married woman cannot marry again.  The penalties which she receives in this mishnah are because she didn’t check well enough to make sure her first husband is dead.  As we shall see, this interpretation has certain difficulties.\nA teacher of mine, Professor Shamma Friedman, suggested an alternative explanation of the mishnah, an explanation that was based on a comparison of the mishnaic law with other laws found in ancient near eastern law codes, such as the Code of Hammurabi.  He proposed that the mishnah actually means that she is married to both men at the same time.  The problem with this is that it is forbidden to be married to two men at the same time.  Since each marriage is valid but forbidden, she cannot stay married to either and doesn’t get the benefits of either marriage.  In other words, both marriages are biblically valid, but each husband makes the other husband’s marriage illegitimate.  According to this interpretation, the woman is not penalized for not having checked.  Rather the problems she encounters are the result of her being married to two men at the same time.",

Neither the heirs of this one nor the heirs of that one are entitled to inherit her ketubah. And if [the husbands] die, the brother of the one and the brother of the other must perform halitzah, but may not contract yibbum.</b>  This section lists all of the results of her having married another man while her first husband is still alive.  I will go through each one by one: She must leave this one and that one, and she also requires a get from this one and that one:  She must be divorced from each of them, for she is forbidden to each.  She also needs a get from each of them.  According to the talmudic interpretation, the get from the second husband is only of rabbinic origin, for according to biblical law, she is not married to the second man. She has no ketubah, no usufruct, no support money or worn clothes, neither from this one nor from that one:  She does not receive any of the financial benefits that she would have accrued from her husband.  This clause was explained above in 9:3. If she has taken anything from this one or that one, she must return it:  If she had taken any of these things to which she is not entitled, she must return them.  Some times, in cases of doubt, possession is enough for a person not to have to return something.  However, in this case, her possession is considered truly illegal and she must return what she took. The child from this one or that one is a mamzer:  The child from the second husband is a mamzer because she gave birth to him while married to the first husband.  Should she return to the first husband, the subsequent child will also be a mamzer. Neither this one nor that one may impurify himself for her:  A priest is allowed to impurify himself to bury his wife.  In this case, if either husband is a priest and she dies, they may not impurify themselves for her. Neither this one and that one has a claim to whatever she may find, nor what she makes with her hands, nor to invalidate her vows:  These are all rights given to a husband during marriage.  Since the marriage is now invalid, he loses all these rights.  Invalidating vows is discussed in Numbers 30. If she was the daughter of an Israelite, she becomes disqualified from marrying a priest; if the daughter of a Levite, from the eating of tithe; and if the daughter of a priest, from the eating of terumah:  The illicit marriage to the second husband disqualifies her from all rights that might be accrued from either kohanic or levitical status.  The result is that she could no longer marry a priest nor eat tithe if her father was a Levite, nor eat terumah if her father was a priest. Neither the heirs of this one nor the heirs of that one are entitled to inherit her ketubah:  According to a ketubah clause which we will see in chapter four of tractate Ketuboth, a woman’s male children inherit her ketubah.  However, in this case they too are penalized and lose their inheritance. And if [the husbands] die, the brother of the one and the brother of the other must perform halitzah, but may not contract yibbum:  Since both marriages were invalid, the brothers cannot perform yibbum.  Note that according to the talmudic interpretation, the halitzah of the brother of the second husband is only of rabbinic origin, since according to Torah law the second marriage was not valid.",

However, he does not have the requisite knowledge (da’at) to give a get, perform ma’amar or halitzah.  One other issue which we must keep in mind while learning this mishnah is that once a woman awaiting yibbum (a shomeret yavam) has had one of these acts performed with her by one of the brothers, she may no longer marry any of the other brothers of her dead husband.\nWe should note that in the time of the Mishnah, not only was marriage considered possible at a very young age, but concepts of childhood were different.  Our perception of childhood as extending well into one’s teens and our assumption that children deserve protection during these years and are not to be treated as adults, are, to a large extent, more modern perceptions.

Rabbi Shimon says: he does not render her unfit.</b> As we learned yesterday, the sexual intercourse of a boy nine years and one day old has legal ramifications.  In our case of yibbum, if a boy who has reached this age has relations with his yevamah, he disqualifies her from being permitted to have yibbum with another one of the brothers.  However, this act of sexual intercourse is not sufficient to completely make her his wife.  The Talmud states that it is not a “complete acquisition”, as it would be if he was of majority age.  Therefore, when another brother, who has also reached this age, has intercourse with her, he causes her prohibited to the first brother.  Since she has now had quasi-yibbum with two brothers (akin to ma’amar with two brothers, see above 5:1), she is forbidden to both. Rabbi Shimon holds that it is doubtful whether sexual intercourse with a boy nine years and one day old can acquire a woman as a wife. In our case, if it does, then she is the wife of the first brother, and the intercourse with the second brother does not disqualify her to the first.  If such intercourse does not acquire her as a wife, then neither does the intercourse with the second brother, and she is not disqualified to the first brother.  Should she wait around as a shomeret yavam until he is of majority age, he may then have yibbum with her. To summarize, the first opinion holds that an act of intercourse by a boy nine years and one day, certainly acquires a woman as a wife, but the acquisition is not complete.  In contrast, Rabbi Shimon holds that it is uncertain whether this act of intercourse acquires.  However, if it does acquire, it acquires fully."

It is akin to ma’amar, which also partially acquires the yevamah as a wife.  Therefore, if the boy has intercourse first with one yevamah, and then with another one, who is also a yevamah, it is like giving ma’amar to two different yevamoth.  In such a case, he may not marry either one. Rabbi Shimon holds that it is doubtful whether the sexual act of a boy nine years and one day old acquires a wife.  Therefore, if it does make her his wife, then the first yevamah is his wife, and the intercourse with the second woman is inconsequential.  If such an act does not acquire her as a wife, then neither did the intercourse with the second woman, and neither are prohibited to him.

It therefore creates a tie to the yevamah, but does not totally remove the ties that she still has to her first husband.  Should this boy now die, she has ties to two yevamim (two brothers, both of whom were her husband).

As we have learned before, according to the sages, such an act partially acquires the yevamah as his wife.  According to Rabbi Shimon, it is doubtful whether the act acquires her as a wife, but if it does, she is fully his wife.<br>Section one:  When the nine year old boy has relations with his yevamah, according to the sages, he partially acquires her as his wife.  If he later dies, without having intercourse with her from the time he reached majority age, she may not have yibbum, as we learned in the previous mishnah, since she is tied to two yevamim (the minor and the brother who first married her). Had he had intercourse with her after having reached majority age, he would have completely severed her ties to her first husband, and she would be able to subsequently have yibbum.<br>Concerning the woman he married after having reached majority age, she may have either yibbum or halitzah.  The question we must ask about this clause is why we would have thought that she is not allowed to have yibbum.  The issue is connected to that which we learned in 3:9, concerning an adult who performed ma’amar with his yevamah, but before he had a chance to have yibbum with her he died.  There we learned that just as she must have halitzah and not yibbum (since she is tied to two yevamim), so too must her rival wife.  Our mishnah deals with a similar situation, where a man dies having ties equivalent to ma’amar with one wife, and full marriage with another wife.  Either our mishnah disagrees with the opinion held in 3:9, or it makes a distinction between the two situations, holding that in one case the woman may have yibbum and in the other she may not.<br>Rabbi Shimon holds that an act of intercourse performed by a minor doubtfully acquires the yevamah as a wife.  If it does acquire her as a wife, then she is fully his wife and she may have yibbum.  If it does not acquire her as a wife, and he has not had relations with her since, then she was never the minor’s wife, and the woman may have yibbum with his brother (in this case she is still tied to the first brother).  In either case, the yavam may have yibbum with either woman.  He must have halitzah with the woman with whom he does not have yibbum or halitzah, lest the intercourse of a minor does not acquire.  If this is so, then the second wife is not the rival wife of the first wife.  If he had yibbum with the first wife, the second wife still needs to be released.   If he had yibbum with the second wife, the first wife still needs halitzah on account of her previous marriage to the first brother. Whichever wife did not already have yibbum lest the intercourse of the minor does acquire, and then the surviving brother would have had yibbum with two yevamoth, which is forbidden.<br>Section two:  The final section of the mishnah relates to the entire second half of the chapter (mishnayoth 6-9).  A boy who reaches nine years of age is considered a minor until he reaches puberty, or until he reaches twenty years of age.  According to the talmud, this is actually true until he reaches the age of 35.  If at 35 he still has not shown signs of puberty, he is classified as a natural-born eunuch."

We will see similar discussions in tractates Gittin and Kiddushin.\nIn the case in our mishnah, five boys from five women got mixed up, and nobody knows for sure who belongs to which mother.  The problem is that should they die without children and they have brothers (or at least each woman has one other son who she knows is her son), they don’t know who is whose brother.  This mishnah teaches an elegant, yet intricate way of solving the problem of who gets halitzah and yibbum from whom.\nIn my opinion these are rabbinic “mindbenders” that some times teach principles but do not reflect reality.",

Thus every one [of the widows] has halitzah four times and yibbum once.</b> After the five children were mixed up, they no longer know who their mother is, nor which of the women’s other sons are their brothers.  When they grow up and take wives and then all die without children, it is unclear which brother of the dead, mixed up brothers should perform halitzah or yibbum for which widow.  The mishnah states that first four brothers should perform halitzah for one widow, and then the fifth brother may have yibbum with her.  If he was really her husband’s brother then the yibbum is done by the person who should do it.  If one of the other brothers was really her husband’s brother, then she has already had halitzah and is free to marry someone else. Then the brother who has had yibbum with one widow, joins three other brothers and repeats the process with the second wife.  She too has yibbum with the fifth brother.  So on and so on they all repeat this process until each woman has halitzah four times and yibbum once. Note that there are other potential solutions to this problem.  Four brothers could give halitzah to each woman and the fifth brother could have yibbum with each wife.  Alternatively, all five brothers could have halitzah with all five wives.  The mishnah probably chose this means of solving the problem so that all five wives would have one husband and no husband would perform yibbum more than once.  Although bigamy was permitted in the time of the mishnah, it seems that monogamy was much more common and probably preferred."

He may not inherit from them, for each husband’s other inheritors can say that he needs to bring proof (which he cannot) that he is this husband’s son.  The husbands split his inheritance, if he dies without sons. He is not liable for striking or cursing either one of them, since it is not certain which is his father.  Note that were it certain which is his father, this is a capital offense. The priests were divided into 24 Temple watches, called mishmarim.  Each week a different mishmar would serve.

This marriage can only be severed by death or divorce.  If the father dies, the daughter cannot be fully married until she reaches majority age.  The rabbis, however, gave the girl’s mother and brother the ability to marry her off while still a minor.  The status of such a marriage is rabbinic (derabanan).

According to one explanation, if while married to this man another man offers to marry her and she refuses that marriage because she prefers her current husband, then she is considered to be his wife.  This is because she has expressed her opinion that she wishes to stay in the marriage, and it is unlikely that she will later make a declaration of refusal.  In such a case if she was the daughter of an Israelite married to a priest, she may eat terumah, and if she was the daughter of a priest married to an Israelite she loses her right to eat terumah.  However, if the hindrance was caused by another factor, for instance the new man was not right for her, then she has not expressed a definite desire to stay with her husband and therefore she is not considered his wife. According to the second explanation, if her husband gave her a get before she made a declaration of refusal, she is considered to have been his wife.  The “hindrance” is the get.  The consequences is that he is subsequently forbidden to marry her relatives and she his.  However, if she makes a declaration of refusal, this is considered a hindrance from her.

We might have thought that since this was so, the sister whose husband died needs halitzah from the yavam, even though the yavam is married to her sister (and hence yibbum is forbidden).

Rabbi Joshua says:  Woe to him because of his wife and woe to him because of his brother’s wife! He must allow his wife to go by [giving her] a get, and [he must let go] his brother’s wife through halitzah.</b>  The more difficult and controversial case is if the elder sister’s husband dies.  She now needs yibbum or halitzah from a deoraita marriage, but her sister is already married, at least rabbinically to the yavam.  If the yavam were to have halitzah with the older sister, the younger sister to whom he is married would become forbidden to him as his halutzah’s sister. Rabbi Eliezer says that in order to get out of this problematic situation, the court instructs the younger sister to make a declaration of refusal, thereby annulling the marriage and making it possible for the elder sister to have yibbum.  According to Rabbi Eliezer, the ties that the older sister has to the yavam (the younger sister’s husband) makes the younger sister forbidden to her husband. Therefore the only solution is for the younger sister to make a declaration of refusal. Rabban Gamaliel disagrees with Rabbi Eliezer and does not hold that the ties to the older sister make the younger sister forbidden. Therefore, the younger sister can either make a declaration of refusal immediately, or she may remain with her husband and the older sister can wait until the younger sister reaches majority age at which time she, the older sister, becomes exempt from yibbum and halitzah because her yavam is biblically married to her sister. Rabbi Joshua says that in this case the husband/yavam will lose both his wife and his yevamah.  Rabbi Joshua agrees with Rabbi Eliezer that his minor wife is now forbidden to him due to the biblical ties that he has with her sister.  However, Rabbi Joshua disagrees with Rabbi Eliezer’s strategy of teaching her to make a declaration of refusal.  This is because Rabbi Joshua holds that declarations of refusal are not desirable and that one should distance himself from them as much as possible.  The yavam cannot have yibbum with the yevamah since she is now the sister of his divorcee.  Therefore he must have halitzah with her.  In this way, he loses both women.

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis chapter is concerned with divorce or yibbum involving a deaf man and/or woman.  As we have mentioned previously, according to the rabbis deaf-mutes lack “da’at”, which I translate as “awareness” and hence they cannot truly contract marriage.  The marriage which they do contract is considered “derabbanan”, that is of rabbinic origin.  I should note that although halakhically speaking deaf-mutes were considered to lack “da’at”, in reality the rabbis often recognize that deaf-mutes do not necessarily lack intelligence.  Furthermore, as I stated in other opportunities, now that complex sign-language has been invented, deaf-mutes can be halakhically regarded as fully intelligent human beings.",

Just as he can marry a woman by making gestures which make his intent clear, so too he can divorce her.  A man of sound senses can divorce a deaf woman, even though she may not understand that she is being divorced.  This is because a woman can be divorced against her will, as we shall see in section three below.",
                    "<b>If a man of sound senses married a woman of sound senses and she became deaf, he may, if he wishes, divorce her; and he may, if he wishes, retain her. If she became insane he may not divorce her. If he became deaf or insane, he may never divorce her.</b>  Whereas in section one the marriage was only of rabbinic status (because one party was deaf at the time of marriage), in this section the marriage is of deoraita status because both parties were of sound senses at the time of marriage.  Hence the law is different in this case.  If she becomes deaf he may still divorce her, because she may be divorced against her will.  However, if she becomes insane, he may not divorce her.  This is a special measure of protection offered the wife so that she will still have a husband and be less subject to mistreatment by others.  If the husband becomes deaf or insane he may not divorce her.  Since the original marriage was of a higher status, he can no longer end the marriage when he lacks “da’at”.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: Why may a woman who became deaf be divorced while a man who became deaf may not divorce [his wife]? They answered him: a man who divorces is not like a woman who is divorced, for while a woman may be divorced with her consent and without her consent, a man can divorce only with his consent.</b>  In this section, through Rabbi Yochanan be Nuri’s question and the Sages answer, the discrimination between the divorce of a deaf woman and the divorce of a deaf man is explained.  Since a woman can be divorced without her consent, she can still be divorced when she is legally incapable of consenting (when deaf or insane).  Her consent is irrelevant.  In contrast, a man must express his will to divorce a woman and hence if he is legally incapable of expressing his will, he may not divorce.  I should note that this is one of the greatest examples of discrimination in Jewish law, but it was mostly corrected in the Middle Ages by Rabbenu Gershom who made a decree that a woman cannot be divorced against her will.  Until this day, this is still the law."

In this case, although the marriage is deoraita (because it was arranged by the father), since a woman can be divorced against her will, she can still be divorced when she cannot express her will. The rabbis take this halakhah one step further, and state that even a woman who married herself off when of sound senses, can still be divorced should she go deaf. Note that we learned this law in the previous mishnah.  The reason that it is restated is that it is a response to Rabbi Nehunian ben Gudgada’s testimony, which was also brought in Eduyoth 7:9."

The consequence of accepting such testimony is that she is allowed to remarry; in cases where the husband had no children she would be allowed to have yibbum with her husband’s brother.\nThe first few mishnayoth of this chapter deal with the wife’s own testimony as to her husband’s death.  Generally speaking a woman’s testimony is unacceptable and a person cannot testify concerning their own matters.  Nevertheless, in this case the wife’s testimony about her own husband’s death is acceptable because the rabbis did not want the woman to be unable to remarry.   We should note that even in our days it is often difficult to ascertain whether someone died.  This was a problem during the Shoah (the Holocaust) when nearly all witnesses to a person’s death were also dead.  Recently, we witnessed this phenomenon in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.  Verifying victim’s deaths took months and to a large degree relied on the testimony of those who saw them in the building or those who knew they should have been there that day.

The rabbis are suspicious that she might lie if there was discord, because by receiving permission to remarry when the husband was still alive, she would be causing herself to be prohibited to him when he returns.  In such a way she could force him to divorce her.  In other words, she might have a motive to lie.

Bet Shammai said to them: do we not learn this from her ketubah scroll wherein [her husband] writes to her “if you are married to another man, you will receive what is prescribed for you”!</b>  Bet Shammai reasons that if she was not telling the truth about her husband dying (either by intentionally lying or by having made a mistake) the consequences of her remarrying are graver than the consequences of her illegitimately taking money from her husband.  Remarrying while still married is adultery, and if done with intention can be a capital offense.  The monetary crime of taking her ketubah while her husband is still alive is at worst fraud, and the money can always be rightfully restored.  Since the Sages allow her to remarry, despite the potential severity of the crime, they must allow her to recover her ketubah payment. Bet Hillel responds by citing a precedent.  According to the accepted halakhah, a halakhah to which Bet Shammai agrees, when a woman testifies that her husband has died, his brothers do not inherit his money.  This is because in monetary cases two witnesses are required.  [Note:  a man’s brothers inherit him if he did not have children.]  Therefore, just as the brothers do not collect their inheritance, so too the woman does not collect her ketubah. Bet Shammai responds by citing the actual ketubah wording which states that if she marries another man she may collect the payment.  Therefore, according to Bet Shammai, as soon as she is permitted to marry someone else, she may collect her ketubah.  We should note that this is an interesting source of halakhah: the wording of the ketubah.  Generally we would think that the halakhah would dictate the wording of the ketubah, but here we find the opposite.  The ketubah, a secular document, becomes the source of Jewish law.  This is not a common phenomenon in rabbinic literature but is found in several other places.",

Why is [the bringing of] a letter of divorce different [from testifying regarding] death?<br>The written document provides the proof.</b>  Although women are generally not allowed to testify in a court of law, in order to make it easier for women to remarry, women are allowed to testify that men have died.  Even a woman’s own relatives can testify that her husband has died.  The only exceptions are certain relatives who are not allowed to testify for fear that they will lie in order to entrap the woman in an illegal marriage, which will cause her current marriage to be terminated.  These women might hate the wife for various reasons.  The mother-in-law might hate her daughter-in-law because she thinks that she is not good enough for her son.  The daughter of her mother-in-law might hate her because she might eventually take away her inheritance.  The rival wife might hate her because they compete for the husband’s affections.  Her sister-in-law might hate her, because if the husband dies without children, this wife could end up as her rival wife.  The husband’s daughter might hate her because she sees this wife as trying to take her own mother’s place. Although these women are not allowed to testify that a woman has died, they are allowed to bring her get to her (we will learn this halakhah in Gittin 2:7). The mishnah asks, why are they allowed to bring the get but not allowed to testify that the husband has died.  After all, both divorce and death end the marriage.  The answer is that with a get, the document itself is what proves that the marriage is ended.  The one who brings the document is not testifying as to the divorce, but is merely a messenger.  However, testifying as to his death is actually testimony, not verifiable in another way.",

If one wife says that he is dead and the other says he is not, the wife that says he is dead is treated like a widow, and the wife who says that he is not, is treated like she is still married to him.  The reason why the first wife is allowed to remarry and collects her ketubah is that her rival wife is not allowed to testify about her, as we learned in the previous mishnah.

According to Rabbi Tarfon we treat each woman as if she might be married to him and he must give a get to each.  However, since he will only admit to marrying one woman, he must pay only one ketubah sum.  The sum is left in court, until it is clarified who he married.

Rabbi Akiva again wishes to punish the thief, and therefore obligates him to pay the amount stolen to each of the five. Note that in both cases Rabbi Akiva is not concerned that he is rewarding the four out of the five women or people from whom something has been stolen who are definitely lying.  Perhaps this is because it is unclear (at least to us) which is lying, whereas it is clear that this person has stolen money, or betrothed a woman without bothering to remember whom he betrothed."

Perhaps this is because it is uncommon for a woman to give birth to another child after her older child is already married.  Furthermore, even if the mother-in-law gave birth, only a male child will make the wife liable for yibbum.  This distinguishes this case from the case in section where a child of other sex will exempt the wife from yibbum, and therefore we are concerned lest she be exempt. If, however, the mother-in-law was pregnant when she traveled, the daughter must be concerned, lest she gave birth to a male child.  The wife must wait until she is certain that her mother-in-law did not have a boy. Rabbi Judah holds that in this case as well, the wife need not be concerned and may remarry immediately.  This is because there are “two doubts”.  The mother-in-law may have miscarried (as older women often do), and even if she gave birth to a viable child, the child might be female.

                    "<b>Another incident occurred at Asia where a man was lowered into the sea, and only his leg was brought up, and the Sages ruled: [if the recovered leg contained the part] above the knee [the man’s wife] may marry again, [but if it contained only the part] below the knee, she may not marry again.</b>  This mishnah deals with a case where a person was cast into the sea and according to the Talmud he was bound.  Later, they drag his leg out of the water.  If when they drag the leg out of the water, it is from the knee and up, then we can assume that the person is dead.  Even if he survived the loss of part of his leg, he would not be able to swim without a full leg.  However, if only the lower part of the leg was cut off, the man might have been able to swim and he might have come out of the water somewhere else.  Therefore his wife cannot remarry. Note that this mishnah became all too relevant in determining whether widows of Sept. 11 victims could remarry.  Since the World Trade Center is like “water that has an end”, it can be assumed that someone who didn’t show up afterwards had indeed died, and his widow was allowed to remarry."

Rabbi Judah ben Bava holds that an Israelite must intend to testify for the one who hears him to be able to repeat his words in court.  A non-Jew’s words can be brought to court only if he doesn’t intend to testify. Note that there are some versions of the mishnah in which Rabbi Judah ben Bava says, “with an Israelite [the evidence is valid] even if the man had the intention [of acting as witness].”  According to this reading, Rabbi Judah ben Bava agrees with the previous opinion about the Israelite’s testimony (it is acceptable whether or not he intended to testify), but disagrees about the non-Jew’s."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe final mishnah of Yevamoth relates some debates between rabbis over the testimony concerning a man’s death.  In our mishnah these debates are set within historical frameworks which relate interesting information as to how the Sages made decisions and about the historical period in which they lived.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Akiva said: When I went down to Nehardea to intercalate the year, I met Nehemiah of Bet D’li who said to me, “I heard that in the land of Israel no one, permits a [married] woman to marry again on the evidence of one witness, except Rabbi Judah ben Bava”. “That is so”, I told him. He said to me, “Tell them in my name: ‘You know that this country is in confusion because of marauders.  I have received a tradition from Rabban Gamaliel the Elder: that they allow a [married] woman to remarry on the evidence of one witness’”.   And when I came and recounted the conversation in the presence of Rabban Gamaliel   he rejoiced at my words and exclaimed, “We have found a match for Rabbi Judah ben Bava!” As a result of this talk Rabban Gamaliel remembered that some men were once killed at Tel Arza, and that Rabban Gamaliel the Elder had allowed their wives to marry again on the evidence of one witness, and the law was established that they allow a woman to marry again on the evidence of one witness, and on the testimony of one [who states that he has heard] from another witness, from a slave, from a woman or from a female slave.</b>  This story takes place when Rabbi Akiva is going to Nehardea, which is in Babylonia, in order to intercalate the year, that is to decide whether an extra month must be added in order to adjust the lunar year to the solar year.  Normally intercalation is done only in the land of Israel.  This event must have occurred during a time of persecution, when courts could not gather in Israel to deal with calendar issues.  In any case, when Rabbi Akiva arrives at Bet D’li a man named Nehemiah asks him if it is true that among the rabbis in Israel, only Rabbi Judah ben Bava rules that a woman may marry based on the testimony of a single witness.  When Rabbi Akiva confirms this, Nehemiah apologizes that due to the marauders, he cannot reach the land of Israel to talk to the Israeli sages himself, but that he knows a tradition according to which Rabban Gamaliel the Elder allowed a woman to remarry upon the testimony of one witness.  When Rabbi Akiva returns, he relates the tradition to the current patriarch, Rabban Gamaliel (Rabban Gamaliel the Elder’s grandson).  Rabban Gamaliel rejoices, for a supporting tradition has been found for Rabbi Judah ben Bava’s tradition.  Note that Rabban Gamaliel was previously not willing to accept Rabbi Judah ben Bava’s opinion, even though he obviously approved of it. Only when he learns of a supporting tradition, does he accept that a woman may remarry based on the testimony of one witness.  After hearing Nehemiah’s words, Rabban Gamaliel himself remembers hearing of an incident where his grandfather permitted the wives of some fallen soldiers to remarry based on the testimony of one witness.  At that precedent-setting incident, several others laws were established regarding testimony over a man’s death.  Hearsay was declared acceptable, as was the testimony of women and slaves.  That is to say the normal rules of testimony were suspended.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua say: a woman is not be allowed to remarry on the evidence of one witness. Rabbi Akiva ruled: [a woman is not allowed to marry again] on the evidence of a woman, on that of a slave, on that of a female slave or on that of relatives. They said to him: It once happened that a number of Levites went to Tsoar, the city of palms, and one of them became ill on the way, and they left him in an inn. When they returned they asked the [female] innkeeper, “Where is our friend?” And she replied, “He is dead and I buried him”, and they allowed his wife to remarry. Should not then a priest’s wife [be believed at least as much] as an innkeeper!” He answered them:  When she will [give such evidence] as the innkeeper [gave] she will be believed, for the innkeeper had brought out to them [the dead man’s] staff, his bag and the Torah scroll which he had with him.</b>  This section contains a debate between Rabbis Joshua, Eliezer, Akiva and perhaps other Sages, concerning these halakhot.  Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Eliezer both disagree with the halakhah that seems to have been accepted by everyone in the mishnah, up until this point.  They hold that for a woman to remarry she needs two valid witnesses to testify that her husband died.  Rabbi Akiva, who lived a generation after Rabbi Joshua and Rabbi Eliezer, and was a student of both of them, agreed partially with them, but also partially with Rabban Gamaliel.  According to Rabbi Akiva, women, slaves and relatives cannot testify.  However, one witness is sufficient. As a proof against Rabbi Akiva, the other Sages (probably not Rabbi Joshua or Rabbi Eliezer, who lived before Rabbi Akiva) bring a story where an innkeeper testified that someone staying at her inn had died, and the rabbis allowed his wife to remarry.  If a mere innkeeper’s testimony is acceptable, then a woman of higher social standing, such as a priest’s wife, can surely testify in such a case. Rabbi Akiva answers that the innkeeper did not merely state that he had died, but she brought out his belongings as well.  If the man had been alive, then he would not have left his belongings there.  In such a case, where a woman has evidence that he died, she is believed.  However, her testimony alone is not sufficient. Despite the fact that the tractate ends by stating that women may not testify about a man’s death, since all of the anonymous mishnayoth above allowed this, and allowed slaves and relatives to testify, as well as hearsay, the accepted halakhah is that all of these are permitted.  Indeed, this is a classic case where we can sense that while the earlier tannaim were generally stricter, later tannaim, including the anonymous editors of the mishnah, were more lenient. Congratulations!  We have finished Yevamoth. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Tractate Yevamoth was the longest tractate we have yet learned (but it is not the longest in the Mishnah), and parts of it were quite confusing (especially the beginning).  For those of you who have learned with us the entire tractate, a hearty Yasher Koach (congratulations).  You have accomplished a great deal and you should be proud of yourselves.  Many of the principles learned in Yevamoth will appear in other places in the Mishnah, especially in other mishnayoth in Seder Nashim.  It will be an especially helpful tractate to remember.  Tomorrow we begin to learn Ketuboth."
