        "Introduction": [
            "The laws of divorce are taught in only four verses in Deuteronomy 24:1-4, verses which directly deal with the prohibition of remarriage.  Interestingly, the Torah addresses the issue of divorce almost as an aside, something which everyone would know without a description.  ",
            "The first two verses read, “When a man takes a wife and has relations with her, and if she does not find favor in his eyes because he finds something obnoxious about her, and he writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house; and she leaves his household and becomes the wife of another man…”  From here the rabbis learn that divorce must be performed with a document, called a “get” which is Aramaic for document (and not connected to the English word, as in “get out of my house!).  Divorce without a properly written document is invalid.  Most of the laws of this tractate deal with how this document must be written and given.  The rules can be quite strict, and to this day, gittin (the plural of get) are written by professional scribes.  ",
            "In Jewish law, the man must give the divorce document to his wife; she may not write a “get” and give it to him.  However, under certain circumstances, many of which were discussed in Ketuboth, the court may force the husband to give his wife a get.  ",
            "The grounds for divorce, while a very important issue in divorce law, are not discussed until the last mishnah of the tractate.  ",
            "We should note that the issue of divorce was an issue of controversy among different groups of Jews in this period.  As is well-known, Jesus, according to one of the gospels, took a strong stance against divorce.  Less well-known is the fact that the Dead Sea sect also, in all likelihood, opposed divorce.  The rabbis were in general quite lenient on divorce.  How easy divorce should be, is something about which we can argue.  Some may say too-easy divorce will lead to instability in marriage, while others may claim that easily attainable divorce is desirable, since a bad marriage is worse than a broken marriage.  I should point out something that is not usually mentioned in these arguments.  In the time of the Mishnah (and indeed until recently) marriages were typically arranged by the parents of the couple, while divorce was a decision taken by those married (or at least by the man).  Those who allow for divorce provide more autonomy for the feelings of the couple than do those who forbid or put severe restrictions on divorce.  Allowing divorce is in a sense saying that staying married is a decision based on the feelings of the couple themselves, be they feelings of love or security.  Forbidding divorce causes the parents’ decision to become permanent, allowing no or little expression for the couple themselves. ",
            "Finally, we should note two an important change in divorce law that was legislated around the year 1000 C.E.  Rabbenu Gershom, a leading German rabbi, made a decree that men could not divorce their wives against their consent.  This was an important balance to his other famous decree that prohibited bigamy.  However, during the mishnaic and talmudic periods bigamy was permitted and men could divorce their wives against their will.  \n"

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah teaches that messengers who deliver divorce documents from abroad must declare that the document was written and signed in their presence.  In the Talmud there are two explanations for this requirement.  The first is that if the husband comes to protest the get, saying that he did not send it, the people who heard the messenger testify that he saw it written and signed will be able to disregard a  husband’s potential appeal. This is especially important if his wife had already remarried and had children.  If her get is invalidated, her subsequent children would become mamzerim.  The reason why the testimony of the messenger is only necessary if he comes from abroad is that in such a case it would be more difficult to find the original witnesses.  Furthermore, in the ancient world travel was often dangerous, and the original witnesses could not always travel to testify concerning the validity of the get.  The testimony of the messenger makes it easier to uphold the validity of the get, in essence a service for the woman.  The other opinion in the Talmud, which is really an additional opinion, is that outside of the Land of Israel they were not knowledgeable in writing gittin. Therefore, someone who came from abroad had to testify that it was written properly.  Those which were written in the Land of Israel did not need such testimony.",
                    "<b>One who brings a get from abroad [to the Land of Israel] must declare, “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.”</b>  This section was explained in the introduction.",
                    "<b>Rabban Gamaliel says: even one who brings it from Rekem or from Heger. Rabbi Eleazar says: even one who brings it from Kefar Ludim to Lud. The sages, however, say: declaration “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed” is required only from one who brings a get from abroad or who takes it there.</b>  The tannaim in this section, Rabban Gamaliel, Rabbi Elazar and the other sages disagree with regard to the applicability of the halakhah in section one.  According to Rabban Gamaliel, even if a messenger brings a get from towns such as Rekem or Heger which lie on the border, he must recite the formula. This is either because it is hard to bring the witnesses from these towns to testify, or because people who live on the border do not know how to properly write gittin.  Rabbi Elazar adds that even if the two cities lie adjacent but one is in the land of Israel and one is not, such as Kefar Ludim, which is outside and Lud which is inside, one must still recite the formula.  However, the sages disagree and hold that the formula must be recited only by one who brings a get from abroad, or one who brings one back from there.  The reason that someone bringing a get from Israel to a different land must recite the formula is lest the original witnesses cannot be found in order to uphold the get.",
                    "<b>One who brings [a get] from one province to another province in foreign lands is also required to declare, “In my presence it was written, and in my presence it was signed.” Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: even from one hegemony to another hegemony.</b>  Just as the messenger must make the declaration that the get was written and signed in his presence when bringing the get to and from Israel, so too must he make the declaration when bringing the get to and from provinces outside of the land.  The reason is that the original witnesses may be difficult to find if there is a need to uphold the get.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel adds that even within one province, if he is switching hegemonies, places ruled by different governors, all within the Roman empire, he must make the declaration."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nIn this mishnah the tannaim continue to debate the definitions of what is inside the land of Israel and what is considered “abroad”, such that a messenger who brings a get from there must state, “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.”  Whereas in the previous mishnah, Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer debated the borders, in this mishnah Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Meir, who lived two generations later, debate.\nWe should note that the Hebrew word for “abroad” is literally translated, “the province of the sea.”  This may mean a place accessible by sea travel but it may also mean coastal towns contiguous with the land of Israel.  Often people would travel to coastal towns by sea, so there would be difficulty in bringing witnesses from there to the hinterland.  Furthermore, these towns were usually more populated by Greek speakers, who settled on the coasts to control the trade.  Jews, or at least Aramaic speaking, less Hellenistic Jews, tended to live inlands. Hence, the rabbis feared that those who live on the coast, “abroad”, do not know how to properly write a divorce document.",

Rabbi Meir says: Acco counts as the land of Israel in the matter of bills of divorce.</b> Rabbi Judah defines cities that he considers outside of the land of Israel, at least for issues of divorce.  Rabbi Meir disagrees with him concerning Acco."

                    "<b>One who brings a get within the land of Israel need not declare, “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.” If there are those who protest [its validity] it must be established through the signatures.</b>  A messenger who brings a get from one place within the land of Israel to another place need not say the formula “In my presence” etc.  The formula is only mandatory for cases where it will be difficult to locate witnesses to validate the get. Within the borders of the land of Israel this will not be difficult. Furthermore, it was only people outside of the land who did not know how to write and sign gittin, and therefore the messenger had to testify to its validity.  Within the land there was no such concern. If someone should come and protest the get, saying that it is false, the court could summons the witnesses.",
                    "<b>If one who brings a get from abroad is not able to declare “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed”, if there are witnesses on it, its validity can be established through its signatures.</b>  This section discusses a messenger who did not see the get written and signed, and therefore cannot state, “In my presence…” In such a case, the default procedure is to validate the get through the witnesses who have signed on it.  In this case the woman receiving the get cannot remarry until its validity has been proven.  In contrast, in the above case, if the get is brought within Israel, she may remarry without validating the get. She only needs to validate if others protest its validity."

                    "<b>Introduction</b> Today’s mishnah begins to compare the laws concerning bills of divorce with those concerning writs of emancipation for slaves.  These comparisons will continue until the end of the chapter. In Aramaic the word “get” means document and not necessarily just a divorce document.   The word can refer to either divorce or emancipation documents, as well as other documents.  Furthermore, there is some similarity to the two situations (marriage in the ancient world and slavery) and between the ways that the two documents (divorce and emancipation) are written.  However, we should not think that the comparison between divorce and emancipation is complete.  The major difference is that a man may sell his slave but he may of course not sell his wife.",
                    "<b>Both bills of divorce and writs of emancipation are similar [concerning a messenger] who takes them [abroad from the land of Israel] to one who brings them [from abroad to the land of Israel].</b>  The rules which we learned above concerning the declaration that a messenger must make upon presenting a get also apply to a messenger delivering a writ of emancipation.  Whether he brings the get from Israel to a foreign land or brings it to Israel, the messenger bringing either document must say “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.”",

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe first section of this mishnah deals with documents whose signators are Samaritans.  The Samaritans were a Jewish splinter group whose history is somewhat blurry.  For more information on the Samaritans, see the introduction to Nedarim 3:10.\nThe second section of the mishnah deals with documents pertaining to Jews which were validated in non-Jewish courts.  This was certainly a common phenomenon in the mishnaic periods.  The Greco-Roman court system was well-developed, as were their laws.  As subjects, if not always citizens, of the Roman Empire, Jews would have had some legal recourse to Roman courts and justice.  Therefore, the rabbis had to discuss the validity of documents which were upheld in these courts.",
                    "<b>Any document which has upon it the signature of a Samaritan is invalid, except for bills of divorce or a writ of emancipation. It happened that a bill of divorce was once brought before Rabban Gamaliel at Kefar Otnai and its witnesses were Samaritan, and he declared it valid.</b>  The mishnah teaches that all documents which have upon them signatures of people known to be Samaritans are invalid, except for bills of divorce or writs of emancipation.  According to Albeck, Samaritans were suspected by the rabbis of lying with regard to issues of money, and therefore they could not serve as witnesses for matters such as loans and acquisitions.  However, they were evidently not suspected of lying in matters of divorce or emancipation and hence they could serve as witnesses in these matters.  Furthermore, they were assumed to be knowledgeable enough in matters of divorce and emancipation. Indeed, according to the mishnah, Rabban Gamaliel once allowed even two Samaritans to serve as witnesses on a get.  This occurred at Kefar Otnai, in the southern Galilee.",
                    "<b>All documents which are accepted in the courts of non-Jew, even if those who signed on the documents are non-Jews, are valid except bills of divorce and of writs of emancipation. Rabbi Shimon says: these also are valid; they were only pronounced [to be invalid] when done by ordinary persons.</b>  This section of the mishnah deals with documents that were upheld by non-Jewish courts or even signed by non-Jews.  In this case, these documents are generally valid with the exception of divorce and emancipation documents.  Monetary documents are valid, because non-Jews are trustworthy to adjudicate monetary matters.  However, since they do not know the laws of Jewish divorce and emancipation, bills of divorce and writs of emancipation could not be upheld in non-Jewish courts, nor could those who signed them be non-Jewish. Rabbi Shimon partially disagrees with the opinion in the previous clause.  According to him, the earlier opinion that said that divorce and emancipation documents done in non-Jewish courts are invalid, referred only to those done by courts which lack knowledge of the laws.  However, if the court was an expert court, they may even draw up divorce and emancipation documents, even though they are not Jewish."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe topic of this mishnah is a man who instructs a messenger to give a get to his wife, or a writ of emancipation to his slave, and then changes his mind or dies before the document is delivered.",
                    "<b>If a man says: “Give this get to my wife or this writ of emancipation to my slave”, if he wants he may change his mind on either document, the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say: he may change his mind in the case of the get but not in the case of the writ of emancipation, since a benefit may be conferred on a person not in his presence but a disability may be imposed on him only in his presence; for if he does not want to maintain his slave he is permitted, but if he does not want to maintain his wife he is not permitted. Rabbi Meir said to them: behold, he disqualifies his slave from eating terumah [by emancipating him] in the same way that he disqualifies his wife [by divorcing her]? They said to him: [the slave is disqualified] because he is the priest’s property.</b>  According to Rabbi Meir, the husband may change his mind after instructing an agent to give a get to his wife or a writ of emancipation to his slave.  The Sages disagree and say that he may change his mind only with regard to the get.  He may not change his mind with regard to the freeing of the slave.  The reason is that there is a principle that one may confer benefit on another person not in that person’s presence, but one may not confer a disability on a person not in that person’s presence. In our situation, the woman/slave is not in the husband/master’s presence at the moment and that is why the husband is instructing a messenger.  For the woman, divorce is a considerable disability for she loses her guaranteed source of income.  Should the husband not want to provide maintenance for his wife (food, clothing etc.) he does not have the right to do so.  He may not say to her, take whatever income you make and use it for your own maintenance.  In contrast, the slave has no such guarantee.  A master may say to his slave that he must provide his own maintenance.  Note that a master may not tell his slave to work for the master and the master will not provide maintenance. The master may only stop providing maintenance, if he allows the slave to work for his own maintenance. Nevertheless, the slave’s income is not guaranteed as is that of the wife, therefore it is a total disability for him not to be freed.  Since this is so, the master may not retract freeing his slave once he has told a messenger to do so. Rabbi Meir responds that in some ways freeing a slave is a disability and therefore, just as he can retract in giving the slave his manumission, so too he can retract from divorcing his wife.  The disability for the slave is that if he was owned by a priest, he could eat terumah. Upon emancipation, he loses such a right. The sages respond that the slave’s eating terumah is not a “benefit”; rather it is something he is allowed to do because the master owns him.  Indeed, the priest could sell his slave to an Israelite and thereby disqualify him from eating terumah without freeing him.  Therefore, loss of terumah is not truly a disability to the slave.",
                    "<b>If a man says, “Give this get to my wife or this writ of emancipation to my slave”, and dies [before they are given], they do not give [the documents] after his death. [If he said], “Give a maneh to so-and-so” and died, the money should be given after his death.</b>  In this case, the husband/master dies before the document is given.  The mishnah teaches that in cases of divorce and emancipation, the messenger should not give the document after the husband/master’s death.  A get and a writ of manumission do not go into effect until they are given.  Since a dead man cannot divorce his wife or free his slave, the documents cannot be given after his death.  In contrast, when a dying person gives a present, his mere statement transfers ownership. Therefore, the present should be given even after the giver’s death."

Even if he can recite nearly the whole formula but cannot honestly say that the entire get was written and fully signed by two witnesses in his presence, the get is invalid.  As we learned above in 1:3, that this get is invalid means that in order for the woman to use this get to remarry, the witnesses themselves must verify their signatures or two witnesses must testify that they recognize both signatures.

A third person says that it was signed in his presence. The first opinion states that the get is still invalid, and still needs to be upheld by validating the signatures.  Rabbi Judah holds that the get is already valid since there is full testimony by two witnesses on the writing.  To Rabbi Judah, the writing is the essential part of the making of the get and if two testify that the writing was done properly, the get is valid.  This is not through their being deliverers of the get, but rather through their being witnesses. However, one person saying that the writing was done properly is not valid, because one person is not full testimony in Jewish law.",

In this case, the get’s date will not match the date upon which it is finalized.",

Since the day follows the night in Jewish counting of days, if it was written at night and signed the following day, this still counts as being written and signed on the same day.",
                    "<b>If it was written by day and signed on the night [following], it is invalid. Rabbi Shimon validates it, for Rabbi Shimon used to say that all documents written by day and signed on the [following] night are invalid except bills of divorce.</b>  However, if it was written by day and then later signed that night, the date written in the get does not match the actual date on which it was signed.  The reason why documents must be written and signed on the same day is that documents can be used to collect collateral.  A debt document creates a lien on another person’s property.  For instance, if Reuven borrows 1,000 dollars from Shimon on the first of the month of Av, Shimon now has a lien on all the property that Reuven owned on that date.  If Reuven subsequently gives or sells property to a third party and then defaults on his loan, Shimon may collect from the third party.  However, Shimon’s lien takes priority only over other debts created after Shimon loaned the money. For this reason, documents whose dates precede their finalization, done in their signing, are invalid, lest someone try to defraud a third party.  Since all other documents whose dates precede their finalization are invalid, divorce documents are as well. According to Rabbi Shimon, money is never collected based on the date written in the get.  A woman collects her ketubah based on the date written in the ketubah.  Therefore, the get which was written during the day but only signed at night is valid.  Even though other documents whose date precedes their signing are invalid, gittin are valid."

Rather it can be written on nearly any material.  The one condition is that there must be no step between the writing of the get and its being given to the woman.  This is the reason that if the get is written on the horn of an ox, he must give her the ox, or if on the hand of the slave, he must give her the slave.  He cannot cut the ox’s horn off and give it to her, for that would be an added step. This halakhah is derived from the verse “And he writes her a bill of divorcement and puts it in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1).  The writing must lead directly to the giving. Rabbi Yose the Galilean says it may not be written on anything that is still alive (like the horn of an ox or the hand of a slave) or is food.  The Torah says it should be written on a scroll.

These people can write a get even though they would not even understand what they are doing (remember that in the ancient world deaf people were wrongly considered to lack intelligence), because as we see below, the critical issue with the get is that it is signed by valid witnesses.   Similarly, a woman may write her own get (this would make for an interesting scenario), and a man may write his own receipt for having paid the ketubah to his wife.  Since the get is upheld not by checking who wrote it but who signed it, it matters not who does the writing.  Although the woman has written her own get, the witnesses will not sign it unless they are sure that it was written upon the husband’s directive.  Similarly, witnesses will not sign a receipt for payment unless they know that the husband paid the money to the wife.",

The exceptions are again those people who categorically do not have awareness.  In all areas of halakhah, someone who does not have “awareness” cannot act as someone else’s agent.  A blind person can also not deliver a get, even though blind people were not considered to lack “awareness”. The Talmud explains this to mean that he cannot deliver a get from abroad to Israel because he cannot say “In my presence it was written and in my presence it was signed.”  Note that blind people were considered to have “awareness”, unlike deaf-mutes who could not really communicate. Non-Jews cannot marry or divorce Jews and therefore cannot serve as agents for delivering a get."

The fear is that these women will intentionally lie in order to trick the woman into remarrying while her husband is still alive, thereby causing an irreparable rupture in their marriage.

As stated in the introduction, these women may nevertheless deliver a get to a wife, thereby showing to her that she is divorced and allowed to remarry.",

The writing [on the get] proves [that she is divorced.]</b>  In this section the mishnah questions why these women can deliver a get but not testify regarding a husband’s death.  The answer is that the get’s validity is ultimately proved by those who wrote and signed the get, and not by the person who delivered it.  Although an agent delivering a get is under certain circumstances required to declare “In my presence it was signed and in my presence it was delivered”, this is not truly testimony, but rather a means of allowing the get to be accepted without checking its validity.  This is why those who are not allowed to testify can still deliver a get and make the above declaration.  In contrast, testifying that a husband has died is truly testimony.  Therefore, since we fear that these women may lie, they are not trusted.  [Note that women in general are allowed to testify regarding a husband’s death in order to lessen the problem of wives not knowing if their husbands have died.]",
                    "<b>A woman may bring her own get but she must say, “In my presence it was signed and in my presence it was delivered.”</b>  Theoretically speaking a woman could even bring her own get and this would not be considered testifying about herself, since the writing on the get proves its validity.  However, she is still required to state, “In my presence it was signed and in my presence it was delivered”, the statement that is always required when a get is brought from abroad to the land of Israel.  This situation could happen if the husband gave her the get outside of Israel but told her that he didn’t want the divorce to be enacted until she reached Israel.  A truly Zionist husband!"

These documents were probably always written by scribes, as they require great skill and precision.  A man walking by heard the scribe and noticed that the names being used matched those of his and his wife.  It dawned on him, wow, I could use this to divorce my wife (I believe that this is intentionally humorous, so you are permitted to chuckle.)

[A scribe who writes] sale documents must leave blank spaces for the name of the seller, the name of the purchaser, the amount of money, the property and the date; [These spaces must be left blank] because of the “takkanah” (.</b>  According to the first opinion in this mishnah, a scribe may write out document formulas before he knows who or under what circumstances the documents will be used, but he must leave the “toref”, the details, blank.  The mishnah lists three types of documents:  divorce, loan and sale.  The reason that these spaces must be left blank in a divorce document is that if they are not, the get will not have been written expressly for the woman to whom it will be given.  This is according to the halakhah which we learned in yesterday’s mishnah.  The loan and sales documents do not have such a requirement.  Nevertheless, according to this opinion they too cannot be fully filled out beforehand because if the rabbis allow this, scribes will do the same with divorce documents.  This is called a “fence around the Torah”, a stringency meant to prevent people from doing that which is truly problematic.  The rabbis forbade filling out all documents lest divorce documents were also fully written out. The mishnah cryptically explains that these must be left blank “because of the takkanah”, or “enactment”, without explain what the “takkanah” is.  There are several explanations for this, each of which is not without its problems.  One explanation is that the “takkanah” was that scribes may write the formulas ahead of time so that when people request a certain document that document would be readily available.  The problem with this explanation is that the mishnah seems to state that the “takkanah” was that the spaces should be left blank and not that scribes might write the formulas.  A second explanation is that the “takkanah” was that they shouldn’t write out the entire document, so that people would not be rash in selling their property or borrowing money.  This is a decent explanation for the sales and lending documents, but does not explain well the issue of the divorce documents, which are invalid if fully written out even without a special “takkanah.”",
                    "<b>Rabbi Judah disqualifies all of them.</b>  Rabbi Judah disqualifies all of these documents.  According to the Talmud, he forbids writing the formula (“tofes”) of the get, lest the scribe come to also write the specifics, which according to the midrash must be written for the specific woman. He also disqualifies loan and sales documents whose formulas were pre-written lest a scribe pre-write a divorce document.

He agrees that pre-writing the divorce formula is forbidden, and this he derives from the midrash.  According to his interpretation, the entire get must be written with a specific woman in mind, and not just the “tofes”. However, he agrees with the opinion in section one that the formulas of other documents may be written ahead of time.  He is not concerned that if the halakhah allows the scribe to pre-write these documents, the scribe might pre-write divorce documents as well."

However, as we learned in previous mishnayoth, similar names may not have been so uncommon.  If the get is immediately found, it is still valid.

Furthermore, if he recognizes the bag or folder which he was using to carry the get, and the get is still inside, the get is valid even if it was found after time had elapsed.

The importance of this halakhah is in the realm of levirate marriage.  A woman whose husband died before he had offspring is liable for yibbum (levirate marriage), whereas a woman who was divorced is not.  Since a get goes into effect the moment that the woman receives it, and not when given to the messenger to deliver, it is important to know if the husband was alive when the get was delivered to the woman.

Today this concept has come to mean good deeds such as charity done in order to make the world a better place.  In the Mishnah its meaning was more specific and it usually refers to correct either problems created because of  marital laws or economic injustices.\nThroughout the Mishnah I will leave the term “tikkun olam” untranslated, as there is no word that precisely captures its meaning.  I also think that the best way to understand the mishnaic meaning of “tikkun olam” is through the examples used by the Mishnah itself.",

Today we learn that in older times the husband could gather together a court and in front of them annul the get i without getting to his messenger or his wife.  This would be extremely problematic for the wife because she might not know that her husband had annulled the get.  If she were to assume that the get was valid and that she was divorced, she might remarry and have children.  In such a scenario, her second marriage would be illegitimate and her children with her new husband would be mamzerim, because she is still married.  Another problem would be that women receiving gittin by messenger would not know if the get was valid, because their husbands may have annulled it.  To avoid problems they wouldn’t remarry.

The problem arose in identifying the get  who was the husband or who was the wife.  This is what the mishnah means “change his name” etc.  The husband would write only one of his names, or his wife’s names or his town’s name and then he would claim that the get was not his and thereby annul it.  Rabban Gamaliel established that the husband should write “The man so-and-so or any name that he has” so that annulling the get after the wife has received it would be impossible.  Some commentators interpret this to mean that this formula itself should be written in the get, whereas other commentators hold this to mean that inside the get the husband must list all of the names that he goes by."

[When the court] refrained from imposing an oath on her, Rabban Gamaliel the Elder established that she could take any vow which the orphans wanted and collect her kethubah.</b>  We learned this law in Ketuboth 9:7-8.  If a widow wants to collect her ketubah money from her husband’s orphans, she must take an oath that she has not already collected.  In our mishnah we learn that at some point courts began to refrain from imposing an oath upon her, for fear that she would swear falsely.  It is not that she would lie but that she would think that the money she had collected from her husband’s estate was not really her ketubah but payment for helping take care of her husband’s children.  If the court would not impose an oath upon her then she could not collect the ketubah and she would be left without any money.  In order to fix this problem the rabbis said that the widow could circumvent the court by taking any vow that the orphans so choose. The vow would be something like, “Let such and such an object become forbidden to me if I have already collected my ketubah.”  This change in the law also kept the court from being involved in potentially false oaths.",

As long as they saw that it was written by the directive of the husband and given to the wife, the get is valid.  However, without witnesses written on the get it will be more difficult to validate.  Therefore the rabbis established that the get should be signed.  We can see that the “tikkun olam” here was done in order to make it easier to validate a get, something that would have been in the best interests of the woman.",

According to the Torah all debts are remitted in the seventh year.  While this may be thought of as a benefit for the borrower (and in a perfect society perhaps it would be), in reality it could work against him.  If lenders see that their loans will be erased in the seventh year they might not lend money, thereby making it difficult for those in need to take out loans.  In order to remedy this problem Hillel established that a creditor could write out a document through which he transmits all debts to the court.  According to the rabbis’ interpretation of the Torah, debts to the court are not remitted in the seventh year.  In this way the creditor’s loans are not erased and the interests of those who need to borrow money (i.e. farmers) are also served."

Since the original master didn’t offer up the ransom himself, he loses the ability to decide whether the slave remains a slave.  According to another source, if the person who paid the ransom decides that he should remain a slave to his former master, the master must pay back the ransom money.   Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that in any case the slave returns to his previous owner.  The Yerushalmi explains that this is in order to prevent the slave from running away.  Another explanation is that the first opinion in the mishnah holds that there is no commandment to redeem slaves.  Therefore, by paying his ransom the redeemer has in essence purchased the slave and may do with him as he wishes.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel holds that there is a commandment to redeem slaves owned by Jews.

Shimon still owns the slave and therefore can free the slave despite the loan.  In such a case, according to the letter of the law the slave is totally free and need not do anything.  However, to protect the slave from an angry Reuven, the court forces Reuven to write out an emancipation document, as if he too has freed the slave.  The slave then writes out a document stating how much he is worth, and with this document Reuven can try to recover his loan from Shimon.

Beth Hillel’s solution for the half slave is beneficial to his master but leaves the half slave in an untenable position.  Slaves and free people cannot marry. Since this person is a half slave, he can marry neither a slave nor a free woman.  However, the commandment of having children “be fruitful and multiply” applies to everyone, even slaves and half slaves.  The halakhah cannot allow a situation where a person has no one to marry.  The world, after all, was formed by God for it to be inhabited, and not for it to lay desolate of human beings.

The last three clauses deal with redeeming captives or sacred objects taken captive.\nUnfortunately, I should note that as I write these lines (many months before you read them) the issue of captives and the price we pay to redeem them is terribly relevant, both in Israel and in the entire world.  Muslim extremists are regularly taking captives (often innocent bystanders and not soldiers) and threatening them with beheading in order to force the political hands of countries with whom they are at war.  In Israel a hotly debated topic is whether to exchange live prisoners for the bodies of Israeli soldiers killed in battle or even for knowledge of the whereabouts of their bodies.   While the mishnah seems to have simple answers for the question of how to deal with these situations, we should note that real life situations are complex, involve people’s families and political forces that differ from situation to situation.  One thing which I think all can agree upon is to pray that our leaders have the wisdom to deal with these situations as best as possible, to when possible redeem captured soldiers, journalists and others, to prevent others from being taken captive in the future, and to put a stop to the terrible people who commit these crimes.",

If a slave-owner sells a slave to a non-Jew he has put a person obligated in the commandments into a position where he will not be able to observe the commandments. Therefore, the halakhah demands that such a slave go free.  Whether or not the non-Jew will observe the halakhah is a different question.  The mishnah seems to be presuming a situation of Jewish political sovereignty.  Secondly, we learned in Ketuboth 13:11 that a husband cannot force his wife to leave the land of Israel (neither can a wife force her husband).  Here we see that a master cannot force even his slave to be sold to someone living outside of the land.",

Therefore this practice is forbidden.  Note that the rabbis do not forbid redeeming captives and paying ransoms, but those ransoms must not be exorbitant.

Saving one person now may cause many others in the future to be treated in a very harsh manner.  Therefore, they should not be rescued.  Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says we are not concerned about future captives but rather about those currently being held.  If we rescue some captives, those that remain in captivity will be ill-treated, and perhaps even killed.  However, if there are no other captives and we can successfully rescue all those that are currently under captivity, we should make such an attempt.  Again, we should note exactly what the rabbis were trying to accomplish the safe return of current captives while at the same time the prevention of harm to future captives.

When this woman who was divorced because she was thought to be an aylonit has children in her subsequent marriage, it turns out that she wasn’t really an aylonit.  Hence she could make a valid claim that her first husband owes her a ketubah.

I will explain both. When a Gentile acquires land in Israel, the land still retains its holiness and therefore the first fruits (bikkurim) which grow from this land must be brought to Jerusalem, as is the rule with all first fruits.  However, the person who buys the land from the Gentile might think that since the fruits grew while owned by the Gentile, he need not bring first fruits.  To prevent this situation, the rabbis stated that the one who bought the land from the Gentile must bring first fruits.  Note that according to this interpretation something done because of tikkun olam is also a “toraitic” law (deoraita).  This is unusual and hence makes this interpretation tentative.  The Talmud adds further complicated wrinkles to this mishnah to solve this problem. Rashi’s version reads, “If one sells his land to a Gentile, he must buy the first fruits and bring them.”  This is easier to understand.  The Gentile will obviously not do so himself and therefore if the Jew doesn’t go back and buy the first fruits, they will not be brought.

This is a case of conflicting values.  We want the creditor to be able to collect from better property in order to encourage people to lend.

The first category is “produce consumed.”  This refers to a situation where someone illegally obtained land, for instance he stole it.  He then eats the produce on the land and sells the land to another person. When the original owner comes to claim the land he extracts the land from the person who purchased it from the thief and he can extract the value of the produce from the thief himself.  However, he can only exact this payment from the thief from unmortgaged property and not from property which the thief sold or gave away to others. In this same situation, the one who purchased the property from the thief and then had to restore it to its original owner collects from the thief the original purchase price.  He also may collect from the thief any money he spent to improve the property, but this amount he may collect only from unmortgaged property.  This is what the mishnah means by “improvement of property.” When a man dies one of the ketubah stipulations is that his widow and daughters are to be provided for from his estate until they are married.  However, they are only provided for from the dead husband’s unmortgaged property. The “tikkun olam” here is that these amounts are not fixed.  Therefore, one who buys from a person who might be in this situation will never know how much debt that person is really in and he won’t be able to be cautious lest he buy property that has a lien on it.  To protect these purchasers, these amounts cannot be collected from them.",

If such an oath could be enforced, people might be hesitant to return lost objects, because people did not want to take oaths even if they were true.

Abba Shaul says that the rule is the reverse.</b>  When the orphans grow up, according to the law they can make the guardian swear that he did not misappropriate any of their money (see Shevuoth 7:8).  According to the first opinion in this section, the orphans have such power only when they were appointed by the father.  If the court appointed the guardian, he is not liable for such an oath.  This is because the court forced him to be a guardian, and he didn’t necessarily receive any satisfaction.  If the halakhah were to force him to take an oath, people would refuse to become guardians.  However, if the father appointed him, the guardian has the satisfaction of helping out the father who was assumedly his friend. Since he has that satisfaction, he will accept becoming a guardian even though he might eventually have to take an oath.  We can see here that the “tikkun olam” is to exempt guardians from taking oaths if the oath would deter them from accepting such appointments in the first place. Abba Shaul reasons that the exact opposite is true.  If the father appoints him he need not swear since he was only doing a favor for the father.  According to Abba Shaul, if guardians appointed by the father were forced to swear they would not want to become guardians.  However, when the court appoints someone to be a guardian he gets the added benefit of the community knowing that the court believes that he is a trustworthy man.  Since he receives this added benefit, he will not refuse becoming a guardian even if it might cause him to take an oath.",

Priests who intentionally made someone else’s sacrifice piggul in the Temple are liable.</b>  There are three types of invisible damage mentioned in this first clause.  If one causes someone else’s terumah to become impure, it has to be thrown away.  If someone mixes in terumah with another person’s normal produce it must be sold to priests at the price of terumah which is lower than the price of normal produce.  Finally, if someone makes an idolatrous libation with someone else’s wine, the wine must be thrown away.  Similarly, if one mixes already libated wine with non-libated wine it must all be thrown away.  In all of these cases the damage is done but the object has not physically changed at all.  The bottom line halakhah holds that damage that cannot be seen is not considered damage.  Therefore, if any of these things were done intentionally, the damager need not make restitution.  However, had he done so intentionally he must pay because of “tikkun olam” to prevent people from intentionally damaging other’s property. “Piggul” is a sacrifice offered by a priest who has intends to eat it at a time when that sacrifice may no longer be eaten.  “Piggul” cannot be put onto the altar and it does not bring about the intended result of a sacrifice (for instance atonement).  This is again a case of invisible damage, and as above, if a priest intentionally causes such damage he is liable."

Usually a person who lacks intelligence, such a deaf-mute, minor or insane person, cannot enter into legally binding contracts, because they don’t understand their ramifications.  However, as Rabbi Nehunia testifies, a deaf-mute can be divorced.  (She was married off by her father).  The reason is that divorce is not dependent upon the woman’s acquiescence; she can be divorced against her will.  Since her will is irrelevant, even one who lacks awareness can be divorced.  Although this might sound harsh, as if the Rabbis are going out of their way to allow a deaf-mute to be divorced, it may have also worked in her benefit.  If men couldn’t divorce deaf-mutes, perhaps they might refrain from marrying them.  By allowing a “way out” the Rabbis might actually be encouraging their marriage.",

Generally this type of marriage is considered to be valid only rabbinically (derabanan) and not valid through Torah law (deoraita).  Deoraita a minor can only be married off by her father.  Only when she reaches majority she can marry herself off without her father’s aid.  Despite the fact that this is really only a “derabanan” marriage, Rabbi Nehunya testifies that it is sufficient for her to be allowed to eat terumah and for her husband to inherit her, should she die.  Even though these are usually rights only given to a valid “deoraita” marriage, Rabbi Nehunya testifies that the husband does receive these rights.",

If one stole a beam and then used it in the foundation of a castle, legally he is bound to take down the castle and return the beam.  Obviously this will discourage people from admitting that they stole.  This admission is an essential part of making atonement for their crime.  To allow people to more easily make atonement, the robber is allowed to pay back the value of the beam.",

Therefore, the mishnah rules that stolen animals can be used as sin-offerings, and that they do procure atonement for the one bringing them, as long as the theft is not publicly known.  This mishnah is not permission to steal an animal and bring it as a sacrifice.  Rather it is permission to use an animal without being concerned that it is stolen property.

Specifically we are talking about land taken from Jews by Romans during the Second Temple and mishnaic periods.  The word “sicaricon” can refer to either the Roman who expropriated the property (in this case I shall capitalize the word); the rule governing land taken in such a faction; a person who came into land by buying it from a sicaricon.",

Practically what this meant was that land expropriated by the Romans was considered to legally belong to the Romans.  Therefore, a Jew who subsequently bought the land did not need to return anything to the original owner.  This was to encourage people to buy back the land in order that it should not remain Roman in perpetuity.",

What this meant was that a Jew who bought the land from the Roman and then went and asked to buy the land from the Sicaricon had not legally acquired the land.  This is because we can assume that the original owner only agreed to sell the land out of fear were he not to sell the land the Romans who had already sold it might lose their sale.  However, if the purchaser acquired it first from the original owner and then from the Sicaricon the sale is valid.",

When a man marries a woman the woman retains ownership over her property but her husband has the right to use the property.   Neither of them may sell the property without the other’s permission.  If someone buys the property first from the husband and then from the woman (who agrees), the sale is not valid.  The problem is that the woman may have sold under duress, being pressured by her husband.  However, if he buys from the woman first, we can assume that the woman sold of her own free will.  If the husband also agrees to the sale, the sale is valid.",

This might have left large pieces of Jewish land in Roman control.  Therefore, a later court made a new rule.  If a person buys from a Sicaricon, he must give one quarter of the sale price to the original owners.  This way people would buy the land and the original owners would get at least some of their money back. However, if the original owners have the money to buy back their land, they still have the first shot at doing so.",

If the land remained with the Sicaricon 12 months, and it didn’t look like anyone was going to buy it, the first person to purchase it has legally acquired it.  In other words, a purchaser need not worry that the original owners would preempt him.  However, the purchaser must still pay compensation to the original owners."

The remainder of the mishnah illustrates the principle with regard to repaying debts.  Note that the one difference between debts and divorce/betrothal is that in the latter case, if the document lands halfway, the woman is doubtfully divorced or doubtfully betrothed.

Bet Hillel is concerned lest while secluded the couple has sexual relations, she becomes pregnant and people think that the child was conceived after she was divorced, assuming that the divorce occurred only on the date written on the get.  For instance, let’s say he had the get written in November, continued to live with her and she became pregnant in February, and he gave her the document in March before they knew that she was pregnant.  People will think that he divorced her in November, the date written on the get, and that the kid was conceived after she was divorced.  Therefore, Bet Hillel prohibits the use of an “old get.” Bet Shammai does not assume that just because they were secluded, they had sex.  Therefore, he allows the husband to use the get so long as they were only secluded but did not actually have sex.  We shall see at the end of the tractate, that Bet Shammai rules that a husband may divorce his wife only on the grounds of adultery. Since divorce is possible only under such circumstances, it is unlikely, and indeed forbidden, for the couple to have relations after he writes out a get."

Neither the heirs of this one nor the heirs of that one are entitled to inherit her ketubah. And if [the husbands] die, the brother of the one and the brother of the other must perform halitzah, but may not contract yibbum.</b>  There are two potential problems with the writing of the get in this section.  The first is that he dated the get to the wrong kingship.  Documents used to be dated to the ruling empire, so in the Roman period, it would be invalid to date a get with dates from the Medean (Persian) or Greek empires.  Furthermore, the rabbis ruled that even dating a document to the building or the destruction of the Temple is forbidden and invalidates the get.   The second problem is that he wrote the wrong place.  Although this would seemingly be a trivial point in writing the get, the rabbis were adamant that any deviation from the precise truth invalidates the get.  As stated above, if this woman now remarries, she is an accidental adulteress and all of the following consequences apply.   For further information, you can look back at Yevamoth 10:1. She must leave this one and that one, and she also requires a get from this one and that one:  She must be divorced from each of them, for she is forbidden to each.  She also needs a get from each of them.  According to the talmudic interpretation, the get from the second husband is only of rabbinic origin, for according to biblical law, she is not married to the second man. She has no ketubah, no usufruct, no support money or worn clothes, neither from this one nor from that one:  She does not receive any of the financial benefits that she would have accrued from her husband. If she has taken anything from this one or that one, she must return it:  If she had taken any of these things to which she is not entitled, she must return them.  Some times, in cases of doubt, possession is enough for a person not to have to return something.  However, in this case, her possession is considered truly illegal and she must return what she took. The child from this one or that one is a mamzer:  The child from the second husband is a mamzer because she gave birth to him while married to the first husband.  Should she return to the first husband, the subsequent child will also be a mamzer. Neither this one nor that one may impurify himself for her:  A priest is allowed to impurify himself to bury his wife.  In this case, if either husband is a priest and she dies, they may not impurify themselves for her. Neither this one and that one has a claim to whatever she may find, nor what she makes with her hands, nor to invalidate her vows:  These are all rights given to a husband during marriage.  Since the marriage is now invalid, he loses all these rights.  Invalidating vows is discussed in Numbers 30. If she was the daughter of an Israelite, she becomes disqualified from marrying a priest; if the daughter of a Levite, from the eating of tithe; and if the daughter of a priest, from the eating of terumah:  The illicit marriage to the second husband disqualifies her from all rights that might be accrued from either kohanic or levitical status.  The result is that she could no longer marry a priest nor eat tithe if her father was a Levite, nor eat terumah if her father was a priest. Neither the heirs of this one nor the heirs of that one are entitled to inherit her ketubah:  According to a ketubah clause which we will see in chapter four of tractate Ketuboth, a woman’s male children inherit her ketubah.  However, in this case they too are penalized and lose their inheritance. And if [the husbands] die, the brother of the one and the brother of the other must perform halitzah, but may not contract yibbum:  Since both marriages were invalid, the brothers cannot perform yibbum.  Note that according to the talmudic interpretation, the halitzah of the brother of the second husband is only of rabbinic origin, since according to Torah law the second marriage was not valid.",

The Yerushalmi (Palestinian Talmud) connects this Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel debate with their debate that appears in the last mishnah of the tractate.  Since Bet Shammai says that a husband can divorce only on grounds of adultery, the very fact that the husband suspected her of adultery and therefore wrote out a get, disqualifies her from marrying a priest.

Since they may have remarried, she requires another get from him.  Bet Shammai is not suspicious that they had sexual relations and therefore does not require another get.  Again, this debate may be connected with their debate over the grounds for divorce.  Since Bet Shammai holds that divorce can only be a result of adultery (or at least suspected adultery), it is less likely that the couple will again engage in sexual relations.  Bet Hillel holds that a man may divorce his wife for almost no reason and therefore there is a greater chance at reconciliation. However, Bet Hillel suspects that the divorced couple may have sex only if they were already married and assumedly had already had sexual relations while married.  In this case, their prior intimacy increases the likelihood that when secluded they will again become intimate.

Evidently, the rabbis believed that for divorce to work it must totally sever the legal relationship between the man and woman.  Any retention of his control over her undermines the entire validity of divorce.",

In other words, “lechatchilah” ab initio the woman should not remarry based on one of these gittin.  However, “bediavad” ex post facto if she has married using one of these gittin, her subsequent marriage is not considered adulterous.  Another way of putting this is that the get is kosher “deoraitta” according to Torah law, but the rabbis declared it invalid “derabanan” from rabbinic authority.<br>Get #1:  If the husband wrote the get in his own hand, it will be easy to verify that he wrote the get through comparison of his handwriting.  Therefore, the get is valid, at least bediavad/deoraita.  However, witnesses are always preferable and considered to be more conclusive.  Therefore, the rabbis said that the get was invalid and that “lechatchilah” a woman should not remarry using it.<br>Get #2:  The rabbis declared that a get without a date is invalid.  We learned above in mishnah 2:2, that without a date we fear that the woman may improperly collect her ketubah from mortgaged property.  However, the get is not completely invalid and if she uses it to remarry, her subsequent child is not a mamzer.<br>Get #3:   In this case, there is only one witness, and not the two that are normally required.  Again, the get is invalid, at least derabbanan, but nevertheless if she does use it to remarry the subsequently born child is not a mamzer.<br>Rabbi Elazar goes even further than does the previous opinion and claims that even if there are no witnesses on the get, the get is completely valid and may even be used to collect the ketubah from the husband’s mortgaged property.  Certainly she can remarry, according to Rabbi Elazar, on the strength of this get.  Rabbi Elazar holds that the witnesses who are essential in the divorce process are not those who sign on the get, but rather those who witness the husband transfer the get to the wife.  The only reason that witnesses sign on the get is for “tikkun olam” the improvement of the world.  It will be easier for the woman to certify the validity of her get using the signatures on the get, and hence they sign for her benefit.  If she decides to remarry without such benefit, it is her right.  That witnesses sign because of tikkun olam was also learned above in mishnah 4:3."

Often (although not always) this is the result of the husband’s refusal to divorce his wife.   The mishnah states quite clearly that if an Israelite court forces him to divorce his wife and he divorces her under duress, the divorce is nevertheless valid.  Only if the coercion is done by a Gentile court, not acting according to Jewish law, is the get invalid.  Even if Gentiles beat the recalcitrant husband, telling him to do what the Israelite court has told him to do (divorce his wife) the get is valid so long as the Gentiles are enforcing Jewish law.  Gentile coercion invalidates the get only if it comes without the request of an Israelite court. After reading this mishnah, one might wonder why, if the Mishnah states that husbands may be compelled to divorce their wives, do women today find it often difficult to get a court to actually do so. I cannot answer this question fully in this forum but we should make three notes. First of all, it is not clear that this mishnah would apply in all cases.  The question still needs to be asked; upon what grounds a court might force a husband to divorce his wife.  The most important issue of all:  what if the wife merely no longer wants to remain married to her husband, without any formal, specific grounds?  Secondly, from the 12th century and onwards, rabbis became increasingly hesitant about compelling men to divorce.  Hence, our modern problem is not so new. Thirdly, it seems to me that the modern problem is not one of halakhah, but rather of rabbis being overly hesitant in using halakhic authority.  It is more of a sociological issue than a halakhic one.  Rabbis could solve the problem, and many have made various suggestions of how to do so.  They are often unwilling to solve the problem for sociological reasons.  However, the subject is too important and complex to be dealt with fully here."

For instance, women seemed to be celebrating with her, saying “she’s married.” With regard to the rumor of divorce, the Talmud explains that this clause refers to the woman who was regarded as married based on a rumor.  Since the assumption of her being married was not based on evidence but on a rumor, a rumor of divorce is sufficient to allow her to remarry.

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe final mishnah of the tractate is perhaps the most important and basic mishnah in the entire tractate.  In it Bet Shammai, Bet Hillel and Rabbi Akiva dispute the grounds which justify divorce.  Part of the basis for this dispute is exegetical how do we understand Deuteronomy 24:1, whose language is admittedly difficult and part of the debate is certainly based on ideology.\nWe should remember that divorce was a hotly debated by Jews in the first century.  Jesus and Paul were quite stringent in their opposition to divorce and the Dead Sea sect also probably prohibited divorce, or at least disallowed remarriage after divorce.  The rabbis, with Bet Hillel and Rabbi Akiva at the fore, were more open to allowing people to divorce.  This is not the proper forum for debating this issue but I will offer a couple of potential explanations for why rabbis were more open to divorce than were other sects of Jews.  First of all, most rabbis took a much more positive attitude toward sexuality and procreation than did early Christians.  Divorce allows a dysfunctional couple to fulfill their procreative and sexual desires elsewhere.  Although divorce can be damaging and abused, it can also be beneficial, at least in rabbinic perspective.  Secondly, the rabbis rarely used the Adam and Eve story as a source of halakhah.  This story contains a strong monogamous ideal and was used by both Jesus and the Dead Sea sect as grounds for prohibiting divorce.  Finally, divorce is clearly permitted by the Torah.  Hence, rabbinic openness to divorce may be seen as at least partially stemming from a simple understanding that God allows divorce.  However, this last reason is less convincing for whereas the Torah certainly allows divorce, it is unclear whether it is allowed in all occasions.  The Torah leaves room for multiple interpretations as we shall see in our mishnah.\nWhile reading this mishnah and understanding this debate, I think we would do well to keep in mind that divorce can be a painful trauma.  While the rabbis may advocate allowing divorce, they recognized well the human pain involved for both the man and the woman. Furthermore, we are dealing here with general principles.  These principles and ideals would apply differently in individual people’s lives and marriages, each with their own nuances.  By talking about the grounds for a husband to divorce his wife, we should not be callous to the real pain that real people feel in such situations.",
                    "<b>Bet Shammai says: a man should not divorce his wife unless he has found her guilty of some unseemly conduct, as it says, “Because he has found some unseemly thing in her.” Bet Hillel says [that he may divorce her] even if she has merely burnt his dish, since it says,  “Because he has found some unseemly thing in her.” Rabbi Akiva says, [he may divorce her] even if he finds another woman more beautiful than she is, as it says, “it cometh to pass, if she find no favour in his eyes.</b> The three positions in this mishnah are all based on differing interpretations of Deuteronomy 24:1 which states, “If a man takes a wife and possesses her, and she fails to please him because he finds something unseemly in her…”  Bet Shammai interprets the verse to mean that he may only divorce her if he finds something “unseemly” in her.  The word “unseemly” in Hebrew can also mean a forbidden sexual act.  Therefore, Bet Shammai interprets the verse to mean that divorce is prohibited only if the husband suspects his wife of adultery. Bet Hillel focuses not on the word “unseemly” but on the word “thing.”  The husband may divorce his wife if he finds any “thing” wrong with her, even something seemingly as trivial as burning his dish. Rabbi Akiva focuses upon the earlier part of the verse “she fails to please him” as separate grounds for divorce.  Even if she has done nothing wrong, he may divorce her if he desires another woman more.  We should note that Rabbi Akiva assumes that he won’t want to or be able to marry another woman while still married to his first wife.  It could be that while polygamy was permitted, it wasn’t always so practical, for economic and social reasons.  There are other versions which imply that Rabbi Akiva thinks that a husband may not stay married to one woman while he desires another.  Rabbi Akiva’s ideal of marriage is one of love and such love cannot thrive when the husband desires another woman. Congratulations!  We have finished Gittin. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. One of the most memorable parts of Gittin was the two middle chapters which discussed the concept of “tikkun olam” repairing the world.  As we saw, “tikkun olam” means remedying economic, social and legal injustices in an attempt to make the world a more livable place.  “Tikkun Olam” is always about going beyond the letter of the law.  This is something we would do well to remember in general while learning rabbinic literature.  Often what we are learning are the basic laws obligations and penalties.  Clearly for the Jews and the rest of the world to have a just society, individuals must do more than just keep the law (although that would be a good start).  They must look at each individual and individual situation and attempt to figure out what actions would aid in improving people’s lives and in avoiding conflict and pain, both now and in the future. Congratulations on making it through another tractate.  May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more Mishnah!  Tomorrow we begin the final tractate of Seder Nashim, tractate Kiddushin."
