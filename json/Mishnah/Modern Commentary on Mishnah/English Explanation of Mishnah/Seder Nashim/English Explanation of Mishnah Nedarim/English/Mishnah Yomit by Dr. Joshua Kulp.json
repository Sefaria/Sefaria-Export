        "Introduction": [
            "Tractate Nedarim deals with vows.  It is found in Seder Nashim because the section of the Torah that deals most extensively with vows (Numbers 30:2-17) discusses a husband’s right to break his wife’s vows.  ",
            "Usually, the word “neder” or vow in the Bible refers to a voluntary sacrificial offering (see for instance Number 29:29).  Vows were sometimes given on condition that something good happen to the giver (see Genesis 28:20-22 or Numbers 21:2).  In that way they were similar to the way today a person might promise to give charity if something good happens, such as recovering from a disease.  However, vows may have also been used in the Torah as a means by which a person prohibits something upon themselves.  The way that this works is that a person says that something is forbidden to him/her like a voluntary sacrifice; in other words the object belongs to God and not to the person vowing.  These types of vows may also be made with stipulations; for instance, if I don’t come to your house, may all bananas be like a sacrifice to me, and hence forbidden.  Our mishnah discusses vows of this nature; a person says that a certain object will be to him a “korban”, a sacrifice.",
            "In the ancient world vows were an important feature of a person’s religious life and people made them frequently.  There were contradicting tendencies; both to make many vows, and to be fearful lest one break one’s vows.  One result is that there developed a means of substituting other words for vows.  For instance, instead of saying “qorban”, people would say “konam”.  In this way a person could feel that he is not actually saying the vow.  However, according to the mishnah, although these are only substitutes, their validity is the same as that of real phrasings of vows.  ",
            "The difference between a vow and an oath is that with a vow a person forbids an object to him/herself, whereas with an oath the person forbids himself to the object.  A vow:  “this bread is like a korban (a sacrifice) to me”.  An oath:  “I swear I will not eat this piece of bread”.  However, it seems that people did not always keep straight the differences between vows and oaths.",
            "Our tractate discusses women’s vows, who can break them (the husband or the father), when they can break them, and under what conditions.  The breaking of women’s vows is mentioned by the Torah, and explicated by the Sages.  ",
            "According to the Torah only a woman’s vows may be broken by another, and only under certain circumstances.  However, the Sages gave themselves the power to release people from their vows, at least under certain circumstances, usually if the vow was mistaken.  This was probably one of the more important functions of the Sage in rabbinic times; to release people from vows which they no longer wanted to take.  ",
            "As a side note, that does not have to do strictly with the Mishnah, the custom of saying “Kol Nidre” on Yom Kippur is a later version of release from one’s vows.  It was first recited in Geonic times (around the 10th century) and was meant to release a person from vows that they made that they may have forgotten.  The popular idea that it is somehow related to persecuted Jews who were forced to convert does not have any basis, although it is a moving theory.  There were Jewish leaders who attempted to abolish the Kol Nidre, including Orthodox leaders, but they were not successful.  \n"

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nNedarim begins by clarifying the validity of substitute words used for vows.  Also mentioned in this mishnah are different types of vows, all of which are mentioned in the Torah.  The second part of the mishnah deals with the validity of certain statements as oaths.",
                    "<b>All the substitutes for vows have the validity of vows. Those for haramim have the validity of haramim, And those for oaths have the validity of oaths, And those for nazirite [vows] have the validity of nazirite [vows].</b>  A substitute formula is just as effective at making a vow as is a regular vow formula.  The mishnah lists several types of vows for which this is true.  The first is a “neder”.  The second is a “herem” (see Leviticus 27:28).  The third is an oath (shevuah).  The fourth are nazirite vows.",
                    "<b>If one says to his fellow, “I am forbidden from you by a vow”; “I am separated from you”; “I am distanced from you”, “that I should eat from yours”, “that I should taste from yours”, he is prohibited.</b>  These are all valid vow formulas, even though he doesn’t formally say that the thing which he is forbidding upon himself would be like a sacrifice.  In other words, a full formula would be “All of your food is like a sacrifice to me”.  Instead he says one of the formulas in section 2, combined with one of the ones in section 2a and thus forms a vow.  For instance he says, “I am forbidden from you by a vow that I should eat from yours”.  Or “I am distanced from you that I should taste from yours”.  In all such cases it is forbidden for the one taking a vow to subsequently eat from the other person’s food.",
                    "<b>If he says: “I am banned to you”, Rabbi Akiba was inclined to rule stringently.</b>  This case is more questionable, whether the vow formula is valid. Rabbi Akiba rules that it is, but even he seems uncertain about his ruling.",
                    "<b>[If one says] “As the vows of the wicked”, he has vowed in respect of being a nazirite, or a sacrifice, or an oath. [If he says] “As the vows of the fit”, he has said nothing. [But if he said] “As their freewill-offerings” he has vowed in respect of being nazirite and a sacrifice.</b>  If he says a regular vow formula and then tacks on at the end the words, “As the vows of the wicked” his vow is valid, whether it be a vow, a nazirite vow or an oath.  Alternatively, there might be a nazirite walking by him and he says, “Behold I am like the vows of the wicked”, he is a nazirite.  Or if he says, “Like the vows of the wicked I shall not eat from you”, he can’t eat from the person’s food.  We can see here that vows are viewed negatively and those who vow frequently are considered to be wicked. However, if he says, “As the vows of the fit” his formula is not valid, since people who are “fit”, do not frequently make vows.  We can certainly sense here that part of the intent of this mishnah is to relate a negative message about taking frequent vows. However, if he says, “like their free-will offerings”, then his vow is valid, because fit people do make vows to bring free-will offerings."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah continues to discuss the various substitutes for vows. All of the cases here are words that sound like the normal word used for taking a vow, or a typical substitute.\nInterestingly, there is a debate in the Talmud over the source of these substitutes.  R. Yochanan says that their source is the language of the Gentiles and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says that the Sages invented them so that people would not actually say the real word.",
                    "<b>One who says, “konam” “qonah” or “qonas”: these are the substitutes for korban.</b>  The normal substitute for “korban”, a sacrifice is “konam”.  Our mishnah lists substitutes for “konam”.  All are valid as vows.",
                    "<b>“Herek” “herech” or “heref,” these are substitutes for herem.</b>  All of these are words that have just been slightly changed from the real word “herem” which we already saw in yesterday’s mishnah.",
                    "<b>“Nazik” “naziah” “paziah” these are substitutes for nazirite vows.</b>  All of these are slight modifications of the word “nazir”, the Hebrew for nazirite.",

                [
                    "<b>If one says “Not-unconsecrated food shall I not eat from you”, “Not fit”, or “Not pure”, “Clean” or “Unclean”, “Remnant” or “Piggul he is bound [by his vow].<br>[If one says, “May it be to me], as the lamb”, “As the Temple pens”, “As the wood [on the altar]”, “As the fire [on the altar]”, “As the altar”, “As the Temple” or “As Jerusalem”; [or] if one vowed by reference to the altar utensils, even though he did not mention “korban”, behold this one was vowed by a korban.<br>Rabbi Judah said: He who says “Jerusalem” has said nothing.</b><br>The normal way of making a prohibitive vow is for a person to say that a certain something is like a sacrifice, a “korban”, which is forbidden to him.  Our mishnah talks about various ways in which a person can make a valid vow without actually saying the word “korban”.  As we could see in the first two mishnayoth of Nedarim, people were hesitant to actually say the word “korban” and hence looked for substitutes.<br>Section one:  In this section a person says something which is interpreted to mean “That which I eat from you should be to me like x”, and the “x” is prohibited to him and therefore he has prohibited the food upon himself.  There are seven examples.<br>1)  “Not-unconsecrated food”, meaning the food should be to the one swearing as if it were consecrated like a sacrifice.<br>2) “Not fit” interpreted to mean, not fit for people to eat but rather fit for sacrifice on the altar.<br>3) “Not pure” your food shall not be pure and permitted for me to eat, but rather set aside for sacrifice on the altar.<br>4) “Clean” your food shall be pure, as is a sacrifice, and hence not permitted to me.<br>5) “Unclean” your food shall be considered unclean to me, but clean for sacrifice on the altar.<br>(6+7) “Remnant” or “Piggul” your food shall be prohibited to me as remnant (sacrificial meat which has been kept too long after being sacrificed and is forbidden), or piggul (sacrificial meat prohibited because it was sacrificed with the wrong intent).  Since both of these are forbidden, the vow is effective.<br>Section two: In this section the person swearing states that food that belongs to another should be to him like something in the Temple.  Although he doesn’t say that the food is like a “korban”, these statements are sufficient to make the vow valid.  The examples are 1) a sacrificial lamb; 2) pens in the Temple used to store the sacrifices; 3) the wood used to fuel the fire on the altar; 4) the fire itself; 5) the altar itself; 6) the Temple; 7) Jerusalem, which could be interpreted to refer to the sacrifices eaten in Jerusalem.  A vow formula may also employ any of the utensils used at the altar.  In all of these cases, even though he did not say that the food would be like a “korban”, the vow is valid and binding.<br>According to Rabbi Judah, saying that food should be “Jerusalem” is not sufficient because he may be referring to other things in Jerusalem besides the Temple.  As we shall learn in the next mishnah, Rabbi Judah also holds that in order for the vow to be valid he has to say “Like x”, and not just “x” itself.  Since he did not say “like Jerusalem”, the vow is not valid."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe first three sections of this mishnah teach that instead of stating “korban” a person can name different types of sacrifices and his vow will still be effective.\nThe final section of the mishnah teaches that a person can make parts of his body forbidden to other people.",
                    "<b>If one says “A korban”, “A wholly burnt-offering”, “A meal-offering”, “A sin-offering”, “A thanksgiving-offering”, “A peace-offering, should be that which I eat from you”   he is bound [by his vow]. Rabbi Judah permitted [him].</b>  In this section, instead of just stating “korban”, the person vowing names other types of sacrifices. The mishnah teaches that these are equally effective in forming vows.  Rabbi Judah holds that since he didn’t say “like a …”, the vow is not valid.",
                    "<b>[If he says] “The korban”, “like a korban”, “korban”, should be that which I eat from you   he is bound [by his vow].</b>  All of these ways of phrasing a vow are also valid.",
                    "<b>If he says, “That which I shall not eat of yours should be a korban”, Rabbi Meir forbids [him].</b>  In this case the person adds an additional negative to his statement.  Instead of saying “that which I eat from you should be a korban”, he says “that which I shall not eat…”.  Hence we might have interpreted the vow to meant that that which he doesn’t eat should be a korban, but that which he does eat should be permissible.  Nevertheless Rabbi Meir rules that it is a valid vow, for the statement could also be interpreted to mean, “Your food is a korban to me, therefore I shall not eat from yours.”",
                    "<b>If one says to his fellow, “Konam be my mouth which speaks with you”, “My hands which work for you” [or] “My feet which walk with you,’ he is forbidden.</b>  In these cases instead of stating that a certain object shall be prohibited, the person states that a certain part of his body shall not do something for his friend.  Now usually one cannot make a prohibitive vow on an action.  Prohibitive vows are only effective on things and not on intangibles.  However, a person can make a prohibitive vow on a part of his body, since parts of bodies are things.  For instance one can say “Konam be my mouth to you”, but not “Konam be my speech to you”; mouths have substance but speech does not."

The second and third sections deal with vow that are semi-binding.<br>Section one: I shall explain each of these cases one at time.<br>“What I might eat of yours shall be unconsecrated”:  Unconsecrated food is permitted, hence he has not stated that anything should be prohibited to him.<br>“As the flesh of the swine”: Vow formulas only work if the object used as a vow is something which can be vowed/dedicated to the Temple, such as an offering.  While swine and the subsequent objects listed in this mishnah are forbidden, they cannot be offered to the Temple, and hence the vow is invalid.<br>“As an object of idolatrous worship”:  This vow does not work for the same reason as above.<br>“As hides pierced at the heart”:  These were used in idol worship.<br>“As carrion”; “As terefoth”; “As abominations”; “As creeping things”:  These are all things which Jews may not eat.  Carrion is an animal which was slaughtered improperly, “terefoth” are animals which died or would have died without being slaughtered.  “Abominations and creeping things” are forbidden reptiles and other small animals, all of which are forbidden to eat.  Again, the vow formula is ineffective because he didn’t vow using something which can be donated to the Temple.<br>“As Aaron’s dough”; “As his terumah”:  These are both gifts that must be given to priests (Aaron’s sons).  They are forbidden for consumption for non-priestly Jews.  However, since one cannot offer them to the Temple, they cannot be used in vow formulas.<br>Section two:  In this case, a husband attempts to forbid his wife to himself sexually, by stating that she should be to him like his mother, who is obviously prohibited to him (nothing Oedipal here).   The vow does not work, since he didn’t use something that can be vowed as part of his vow formula.  However, the rabbis did not want people to take these matters lightly and hence they said that he had to find an “opening” for breaking his vow.  For this, he will need to see a Sage.  We will learn more about how this is done towards the end of the tractate.<br>Section three:  At the end of the previous chapter we learned that a vow does not work on something that has no substance.  Therefore, when one says “Konam (a valid formula) that I should not do something” the vow is not valid, since actions do not have substance.  However, our mishnah rules that the one who took such a vow should nevertheless keep his word.  He still must follow the prohibition in Numbers 30:3, that a person must do all that he promised.<br>In contrast, oaths (shevuoth) can be made on actions, for an oath relates to the person and not to the object.  Therefore, one who swears an oath not to do something is bound by Torah law to keep his word."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah compares vow formulas with oath formulas.",
                    "<b>[If he says,] “A korban should be what I do not eat of yours”; “By a korban! If I eat of yours”; “What I do not eat of yours should not be a korban to me” the vow is not binding.</b>  I will explain each of these individually. “A korban should be what I do not eat of yours”:  This is an ineffective vow, because he is not forbidding anything which he will eat. The only thing that is forbidden to him is that which he will not eat in any case. “By a korban! If I eat of yours”:  This translation is based on an emendation to the mishnah, created by the Talmud.  The mishnah itself states “A korban should be what I eat from you”.  That should not be considered invalid formula.  Therefore the Talmud suggests that the mishnah should read “By a korban!  If I eat of yours.”  He has not stated that the food should be forbidden, rather he has used the word “korban” to state that he will not eat from the other person. Such a formula is not valid in vows. “What I do not eat of yours should not be a korban to me”:  We might have assumed that this double negative implies that what he doesn’t eat should not be a korban, but what he does eat should be a korban. However, this mishnah holds that we do not learn positive implications from negative statements.  Saying that something  will not be a korban does not mean that other things will.",
                    "<b>[If he says], “An oath [that] I will not eat of yours”; “An oath that  I eat of yours”; “No oath [that] I will not eat of yours” his oath is valid.</b>  All of the above formulas are valid if the word “shevuah” or oath is used instead of a vow.  Again, I will explain them one at a time. [If he says], “An oath [that] I will not eat of yours”:  This is a normal oath formula is certainly valid. “An oath that I will eat of yours”:  It would seem that this statement should not cause him to be prohibited to eat from his fellow’s food.  On the contrary it seems that he is saying that he will eat from his friend.  The Talmud understands this to be referring to a case where Reuven is pressuring Shimon to eat at his house.  Shimon says several times that he will not, and then finally blurts out “An oath that I will eat of yours”. The context of his saying makes it clear that Shimon’s intent was not to eat at Reuven’s home.  However, in other contexts this is not an oath formula that would cause a prohibition. “No oath [that] I will not eat of yours”:  We could deduce from here that although he has not made a prohibitive oath on that which he will not eat from his fellow, he has made a prohibitive oath on that which he will eat.  Although above, in section one regarding vows we stated that we do not make positive deductions from negative statements, with regard to oaths we do.",
                    "<b>In these instances oaths are more stringent than vows. There is [also] greater stringency in vows than in oaths. How so? If one says, “Konam be the sukkah that I make,”; “The lulav that I take”;  “The tefillin that I put on”; as vows they are binding, but as oaths they are not, because one cannot swear to transgress the commandments.</b>  The mishnah now points out that since the vows made in section one were invalid whereas the oaths were valid, oaths are in some senses stricter than vows. However, in another matter vows are more strict.  A person cannot take an oath not to observe a commandment, because he is already biblically obligated to observe the commandment.  However, he could state that a given ritual object is forbidden to him with a “konam” vow.  In such a case he is still obligated to perform the commandment.

However, if his intention was that the object should be prohibited to him as is meat sacrificed for idols or wine offered to idols, his vow is invalid.

However, those of the Galilee, who live further away from the Temple, would not know as much about “terumah of the Temple-chamber” and hence we can assume that they were referring to the terumah given to priests. Similarly, unspecified vows using “herem” are interpreted leniently in Judea because they may refer to the “herem” of the priests, for many priests lived in Judea.  In contrast, in the Galilee, “herem” would more typically refer to a sacrifice and therefore the vow is valid. We see here that Rabbi Judah assumes that the interpretation of the vow depends on the commonly used language of the one who vows.

All of these vows are not valid, for the person claims that his intention was not to make a vow.  As we learned in yesterday’s mishnah, if a person vows and then explains that his intention was not to make a valid vow, his vow is not valid.  Therefore, the person should not approach a sage to ask the sage to absolve him of his vow.  However, if he nevertheless does approach the sage, Rabbi Meir says he should be punished and not absolved of his vow.  This is because his very asking shows that he is an ignoramus, and Rabbi Meir holds that ignoramuses should not be allowed to get out of vows, so that they will not make more vows in the future. The Sages hold that the sage who is approached to dissolve the vow should find other grounds to dissolve the vow, for the Sages hold that such a vow is actually valid.  Since the likelihood is that the person intended the vow to be valid, his claim that he intended something else is not accepted.  If the sage wishes to dissolve the vow he can only do so on other grounds, the same way that he dissolves all vows.  Furthermore, we teach him not to make frivolous vows, however he is not punished as Rabbi Meir says."

The first category is one who vowed in order to give himself or someone else more incentive to do something.

People say these things in order to give themselves more incentive.",

However, when he makes the vow, he must remember that he made the original stipulation that his vows would not be valid. The above explanation of Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob’s statement is according to the words in our mishnah, where it seems as if he is stating one halakhah.  However, the Talmud explains that Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob actually says two things. First of all, a vow taken to get another person to eat at one’s place, is a vow of incentive, and therefore need not be kept. Second, a person may state that all future vows will be invalid, and as long as he remembers this statement when he vows in the future, his vows will be invalid. By the way, the latter statement is one of the sources of the practice to nullify future vows at Kol Nidre on Yom Kippur."

Furthermore, vows made based on false assumptions, such as that one’s wife stole something or beat one’s child, or the false presumption that people eating one’s figs should not be eating them, are also invalid. The final question in the mishnah is whether or not a vow can be half-valid, in other words valid with regard to some people and invalid with regard to others.  In the case of the figs, both Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel agree that the brothers and father can eat, because the person who vowed intended to prohibit the figs only to strangers.

Indeed, this is truly hard to imagine; after all, what worse crime is there than murder.  Albeck explains that the terumah vow refers only to tax collectors, who would not collect taxes from terumah.  He refers to Josephus who says that the Romans allowed terumah to be exempt from taxes.

We should note that descent, both physical and spiritual from Abraham was a “hot” issue in Mishnaic times, and we often find it being debated in early Christian texts.  In Christian texts we find Christian leaders telling Jews that although they are physical (carnal) descendents of Abraham, they are not his only spiritual descendents.  In our mishnah we sees rabbis claiming that only Jews are Abraham’s descendents; non-Jews, although some of them may trace their roots to Abraham, are not actually his descendents.

Because he loses out, he is not considered as benefiting from them.

And it says, “And this uncircumcised Philistine shall be [as one of them]” (I Samuel 17:6). And it says, “Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult” (II Samuel 1:20). Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah says: The foreskin is loathsome, since it is a term of disgrace for the wicked, as it says, “For all the nations are uncircumcised”. Rabbi Ishmael says:  Great is circumcision, since thirteen covenants were made upon it. Rabbi Yose says: Great is circumcision, for it overrides the Sabbath. Rabbi Joshua ben Karha says: Great is circumcision for Moses’s punishment for neglecting it was not suspended even for one hour. Rabbi Nehemiah says:  Great is circumcision, since it overrides the laws of leprosy. Rabbi says:  Great is circumcision, for despite all of the commandments which Abraham fulfilled he was not designated complete until he circumcised himself, as it says, “Walk before me, and be complete” (Genesis 17:1). Another explanation: “Great is circumcision, for were it not for it, the Holy One, Blessed Be He, would not have created the world, as it says, “Were it not for my covenant by day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:35).</b>  The term “circumcised” refers to Jews, even to those Jews who are not circumcised, for either legitimate or illegitimate reasons.  The term “uncircumcised” refers to non-Jews, even to those non-Jews who did circumcise (it is known that some non-Jews did practice circumcision, for instance Arabs and Egyptians).  As a prooftext Jeremiah 9:25 is brought.  According to this verse non-Jews are uncircumcised, no matter whom they are.  Israelites, however, are circumcised in their foreskins, even if they are not always circumcised in their hearts.  We should again note that there may exist a polemic in this mishnah with early Christianity.  In Acts 7:51, Stephen says “You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart”. In Romans 2:29, Paul says, “Rather, a real person is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart it is spiritual and not literal.”  We can clearly see the distinction between the Jews and the Christians (who, of course, claimed at the time to be the true Jews).  The Jews admit, based on Jeremiah, that they are not necessarily “uncircumcised of the heart”.  A Jew still must strive to be better and to obey God’s commands.  However, the validity of real circumcision (of the foreskin) is not lessened at all.  Indeed, as a sign of God’s covenant, it is the primary commandment.  It was certainly, the greatest distinguishing sign between Jew and non-Jew, both in the ancient world and to this day.",
                    "The mishnah now brings seven statements that emphasize the importance of circumcision. 1.  The first of these statements connects to the verse used above from Jeremiah.  This is the bridge to the rest of the mishnah. 2. In Genesis 17, the word “berith”, covenant, as in “berith milah”, the “covenant of circumcision”, is stated thirteen times. 3. Circumcision may be performed on the Sabbath, even though it involves the cutting of the flesh which is otherwise prohibited on the Sabbath. 4. In Exodus 4:24, on his way back to Egypt, despite Moses’s great merits, and despite the fact that God had just instructed him to lead the people out of Egypt, God almost kills him for not having circumcised his son. 5. Normally, one may not cut off a spot of leprosy (see Deuteronomy 24:8).  However, if the spot of leprosy appears on the foreskin, it may be cut off. 6. Only after circumcision is Abraham called “complete”. 7. This verse mentions a covenant kept day and night.  The midrash states that this must refer to circumcision, which exists on a person’s body both day and night.  Indeed, were it not for this important commandment, God would not have created the world. There is little doubt in my mind that this long mishnah is aimed either at early Christians who denied the importance of physical circumcision, or at Hellenizing Jews, who refused to circumcise themselves, or “uncircumcised” themselves.  Romans often forbade circumcision, and these statements, which may be slightly exaggerated, are meant to encourage Jews to maintain this commandment, one which would not have been easy, for both physical and social reasons, in the ancient world."

Even if Reuven cannot receive benefit from Shimon, Shimon may pay his half shekel.  Similarly, Shimon may pay off Reuven’s debts.  Both of these are permitted because Shimon is not giving money directly to Reuven. Shimon may also return a lost object to Reuven because he is only returning to Reuven what is already his.  Furthermore, all Shimon is doing is fulfilling the mitzvah of returning lost objects. If people customarily offer financial rewards to someone who returns a lost object, Shimon may not turn down Reuven’s offer of a reward, because by doing so he would be giving financial benefit to Reuven.  If Shimon does not want to just take the money, he may donate it to the Temple by making it sacred property.

Rabbi Judah said: The Galileans need not assign [their portion], because their ancestors have already done so for them.</b>  This next section gives advice on how to deal with a situation in which Reuven cannot benefit from all municipal property because he cannot benefit from Shimon’s property and likewise Shimon may not benefit from municipal property because of Reuven’s partial ownership.  After all, this could make life quite difficult.  The solution is that both write out a document assigning their shares to the Patriarch, so that he owns their share of the municipal property.  In this way, they will not be benefiting from each other’s property but from the Patriarch’s. Rabbi Judah says that they need not assign the property to the Patriarch but rather may assign it to any individual.  The only difference between the two is that the transaction with the Patriarch does not require any formal transaction, whereas a transaction with an ordinary person does. The other Sages hold that no matter whom one assigns the property, a formal transaction is required.  The only reason that the earlier halakhah mentioned assigning the property to the Patriarch was that this was the normal way of doing things.  In other words, it is a suggestion and not mandatory.  In contrast, Rabbi Judah would say that the halakhah mentions the Patriarch because it is easier to assign him property than to an ordinary individual.  Nevertheless, he too would hold that this is not mandatory. Finally, Rabbi Judah says that in the Galilee the Patriarch is already the formal owner of all municipal property, and hence the entire problem will not arise."

Our mishnah teaches that when Reuven gives the property to Levi so that Shimon who cannot receive benefit from Reuven, may use the property, the gift needs to be complete.

It is unclear how this situation arose, whether the father or the son initiated the vow.  In any case, there was clearly strife in their past.  Now that his own son is marrying, the son wants his father to be able to attend the wedding and join in the feast.  To solve the problem he gives the courtyard and the food to a third party.  However, the third party declares that it is all dedicated to the Temple, which would make it impossible to use for a feast.  The Sages rule that since the son does not want the dedication to be valid, he did not really give it to the third party.  Therefore it is still his, and his father may not come to the wedding. This is truly a sad situation, and it is clearly meant to demonstrate what disastrous results may arise from rashly-made vows taken against loved ones.  Indeed, it may still ring as a warning in our ears, not to let our disagreements with family members cross the line of no return.  It is a message that unfortunately too many families need."

This is a perimeter around a city of 2000 amot, which is the distance a person can walk outside of the city on Shabbat.  In Numbers 35:5, this area is referred to as “outside the city.”  However, he may not enter its “outskirts”, a perimeter of 70 amot and four tefachim outside of the city.  The Shabbat borders are measured from the end of the outskirts, and hence the outskirts are considered part of the city. In contrast, one who vows not to benefit from a house, may not enter from the place of the door and inwards. However, he may go onto the porch even though this area is similar to the “outskirts” of a city."

It is important to remember that in Israel it only rains from the fall through the spring, roughly speaking from Sukkot until Pesach.  In the late spring and summer it almost never rains, and even on the rare occasion that it does, such rain does not benefit the crops.\nThe third section deals with the problem of leap (intercalated) years. The Jewish year consists of twelve lunar months.  To adjust the lunar calendar to the solar calendar, about once every three years an extra month is added. This month is called “second Adar”, for it falls after first Adar, the last month of the year (if we count from Nisan, as the Torah does).\nThe final section of the mishnah returns to the topic taken up above in mishnah 2, about when vows end if they were made “until Pesach.”",

In the Talmud they dispute when the second rainfall is; some say the seventh of Heshvan, some the 17th, and others the 23rd.  Therefore, according to this opinion, he would have to wait for this date (according to whichever date is the accepted opinion) and then for it to rain.

Other commentators hold that Rabbi Judah does not disagree with that opinion but rather the two mishnayoth refer to vows on two different vows, wine and other things.  Rabbi Judah holds that if he says “Until Pesach shall be,” with regard to other prohibitions, his intention is until Pesach is over.

The mishnah illustrates this with two examples.  In the first, a person vows that a certain so-and-so should not benefit from him, but then later on so-and-so either becomes a scribe, meaning a teacher of Bible, or is about to give his son in marriage.  Similarly, one vows that he will not enter a certain house, and then it becomes a synagogue.  The one who vowed claims that had he known these things would happen, he would not have made his vow.  Rabbi Eliezer allows this new fact to be grounds for the release of the vow, but the sages do not.  The Sages reason that since the new fact did not exist when he vowed, we cannot say that the vow was made by mistake.  Rather the one who vowed did not take into account all future possibilities.

Our mishnah discusses situations in which a person makes a vow that was not originally based on a mistaken premise, but the premise upon which the vow was based changes later.  Rabbi Meir says that these are not really considered “new facts” (see previous mishnah) and therefore, the vow may be released using them as grounds.  The sages disagree.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Meir says: Some things are similar to a new fact, and yet are not [treated] as new; but the Sages do not agree with him. How so? If one says, “Konam that I do not marry so and so, because her father is wicked,” and [then] they say to him “He is dead,” or, “He has repented,”; “Konam is this house which I will not enter, because it contains a wild dog,” or, “because there is a snake in it,” and [then] they say to him, “The dog is dead,” or, “The serpent has been killed,” behold these are like new facts, yet actually not [treated] as new facts. But the sages do not agree with him.</b> In both cases the person vowing states why he has made his vow and the premise was correct at the time of the vow.  For instance, when he vowed not to marry the woman her father was wicked and alive. However, he subsequently died and therefore the reason for the vow ceased to exist.  In the other case, when he vowed not to enter the house, the wild dog or snake was still alive and only died later.  According to Rabbi Meir this is more similar to a vow based on a mistaken premise than to a new fact.  Although the person did not say specifically, “Konam that I do not marry so and so as long as her wicked father is alive”, this was his intent. Therefore, although he is not automatically released from his vow (as he would have been if the premise had been mistaken) a sage may use this as a basis to release the vow. The Sages disagree and say that this too is a situation of a “new fact”, and as they said in the previous mishnah, so too here, a “new fact” cannot be used as the basis for the release of a vow."

This very act is actually a transgression of five separate commandments, four of which are found in Leviticus 19:17-18.  The fifth commandment is that a Jew may not let his fellow become poor but rather they must live “side by side”, which is interpreted here to mean, that those who have means must aid those who do not.  If the one who vows admits that had he known that his vow would cause him to transgress so many commandments he would not have vowed, he may be released from his vow.<br>In my opinion this mishnah is emblematic of Jewish social ethics.  The mitzvot regarding concern for one’s neighbor and love for one’s fellow human being, are not merely ideals, left for individuals to pursue according to their own understanding.  Rather they have real manifestations in this world and govern our everyday actions.  Judaism is a religion in which ideals are translated into laws, which dictate precisely how a Jew is to live.  The laws of “love” dictate that a vow which prohibits one’s property to another is a sinful vow which should be released."

We should note that the attitude towards divorce expressed in this mishnah is probably not shared by most people today, nor was it shared by all in the time of the mishnah.  According to some rabbis (and according to some early Christians), divorce was only permissible if the woman was adulterous.  There were no other grounds for divorce.  Most rabbis, including Beth Hillel and later Rabbi Akiva, were more lenient and allowed divorce more easily.  For the former position, the children and indeed former husband of the divorced woman, were shamed.  For Beth Hillel and Rabbi Akiva this was less so.  Indeed, in American society, which was and still is to a certain extent dominated by Christian values, divorce is still considered by some to be a stain on one’s moral record.

Whereas the release of vows, the topic of the previous chapter, is not mentioned in the Torah, chapter 30 of Numbers discusses the father/son’s right to annul vows at length.  Indeed most of what we know about vows comes from the context of this chapter.  Thus vs. 6 states, “But if her father restrains her on the day he finds out, none of her vows or self-imposed obligations shall stand.”  Vs. 13 makes a similar statement concerning the husband.\nThere are several limits that the rabbis placed on this right of fathers/husbands.  First of all, as we shall learn later in the chapter, not all vows may be annulled.  Second, the father may annul his daughter’s vow only until she has reached what was considered majority age (12 ½).  Beyond that age she was obligated, as are all people, to keep all her vows.\nOur mishnah discusses the betrothed young woman, one between the ages of 12 and 12 ½.  This girl is still living in her father’s house and yet is already betrothed to another man.

Rabbi Eliezer reasons that in a normal marriage a woman is acquired by the man himself (“acquisition” is one of the typical ways by which the mishnah refers to marriage) but in yibbum Heaven bequeaths the yevamah to the yavam.  In other words the relation between the yavam and the yevamah is created at the moment of the brother’s death without any action by the yavam and therefore it is a stronger connection.  If in the weaker acquisition the husband is allowed to annul vows, so too in the stronger acquisition. Rabbi Akiva responds by pointing out that the two situations are not truly analogous.  If there are two or more yevamim then each has some rights in her, because any of them can perform yibbum or halitzah with her.  However, in cases of normal marriage, only the betrothed husband has rights in her, for only he will be able to marry her. Rabbi Joshua points out that Rabbi Akiva’s refutation of Rabbi Eliezer holds true only if there is more than one yavam.  If there is only one yavam he is the only one who has rights in her, and therefore he should be allowed to annul her vows.  Why then does Rabbi Akiva say that he cannot. Rabbi Akiva responds again, this time with a more fundamental difference between normal marriage and yibbum.  The union between a betrothed couple is stronger than the unity between a yavam and a yevamah (remember this is before yibbum has been performed; after yibbum she is his wife in all regards).  A betrothed woman who has relations with a man other than her betrothed husband is an adulteress and is technically liable for the death penalty.  In that sense Jewish betrothal works like marriage.  In contrast, a yevamah who has relations with a man other than her yavam is not considered an adulteress and has merely broken a less severe commandment, one not punishable by death.  From here we can deduce that the bond of betrothal is stronger and therefore a betrothed husband may annul his betrothed wife’s vows but a yavam may not do so for his yevamah."

Said Rabbi Eliezer: if he can annul vows which have already had the force of a prohibition, surely he can annul those which have not had the force of prohibition! They said to him: behold, it is said, “Her husband may uphold it, and her husband may annul it” (Numbers 30:14), that which has entered the category of upholding, has entered the category of annulment; but that which has not entered the category of upholding, has not entered the category of annulment.</b>  This section discusses the reverse situation, in which the husband wishes to annul vows that his wife takes while he is away.  Rabbi Eliezer says this annulment is effective and the Sages say that it is not. Rabbi Eliezer argues that if a man can annul a vow that has already taken effect, he should be able to annul a vow before it has begun to be effective. A husband can annul vows on the day he hears them even though she vowed earlier (we will learn more about this tomorrow).  In other words, even if she vowed earlier and therefore had to keep her vow before it was annulled, on the day that he hears of the vow he may still annul it.  From here Rabbi Eliezer concludes that he certainly should be able to annul a vow that has not yet had a prohibitory force. The Sages respond with a midrash on a verse in Numbers.  This verse compares upholding and annulling.  Since, as we learned in section one, only a vow which has already been made can be upheld, so too only a vow that has already been made can be annulled.  To the Sages their midrash is more authoritative and convincing than Rabbi Eliezer’s reasoning."

                    "<b>The annulment of vows is the whole day. This may result in a stringency or in a leniency. How is this so? If she vowed on the eve of the Sabbath, he can annul on the eve of the sabbath and on the Sabbath day until nightfall. If she vowed just before nightfall, he can annul only until nightfall: for if night fell and he had not annulled it, he can no longer annul it.</b> The period allotted for annulling vows is one whole day.  That day is calculated by the calendar and not by counting 24 hours from the time the father/husband heard the vow.  In other words, the vow must be annulled on the calendar day on which it was taken.  Remember, the Jewish day is calculated from evening until evening.  As the mishnah points out, sometimes this will result in a longer time and sometimes in a shorter time.  For instance, if he hears of the vow on the eve of the Sabbath (late Friday afternoon, towards twilight), he has until nightfall the following night, when the Sabbath is over.  This is because twilight is already considered part of the Sabbath and the Sabbath is not over until nightfall. However, if he hears of the vow just before nightfall on the Sabbath itself, he only has until nightfall.  After that he may no longer annul the vow. The reason that the mishnah uses the example of the Sabbath and not any other day of the week is to teach that vows may be annulled on the Sabbath."

Furthermore, vs. 17 states, “These are the laws that the Lord commanded Moses between a man and his wife.”  From this verse the rabbis learned that even if the vow is not one of self-denial, if it involves an issue between the woman and her husband, the man may annul the vow.  This chapter discusses these issues.\nWe should note that by placing these limits on her vows, the rabbis limit the power the husband has over his wife.

Another interpretation of this mishnah is that the woman says, “Bathing is forbidden to me forever if I bathe today” or “A shevuah that I shall not bathe”.

Since if she does produce an extra amount, it will be difficult for a husband not to derive some benefit from it, he should annul the vow to avoid the potential problem. The reason that he has a right to annul the vow even though it is not a vow of self-denial is that this is something that comes between him and her.

The Talmud explains that this claim is made by a priest’s wife who says that she has been raped.  As we have learned, a priest may not stay married to his wife if she has had sexual intercourse with someone prohibited to her, even if the intercourse was against her consent. 2) “Heaven is between me and you”.  Some commentators interpret this to be a veiled reference to the husband’s inability to perform the sexual act.  She is saying, as distant as the heaven is from the earth, that is how distant you and I are from each other in sexual matters. 3) “I have been removed from the Jews”.  This refers to a vow she made not to receive sexual benefit from Jews, which includes her husband.  She may have made the vow because sexual intercourse is not pleasurable for her. The sages believed these statements because they assumed that a woman would not make such things up.",
                    "<b>But subsequently they changed the ruling to prevent her from setting her eye on another and spoiling herself to her husband: She who said, “I am defiled unto you” must bring proof. “Heaven is between me and you” they [shall appease them] by a request. “I have been removed from the Jews”   he [the husband] must annul his portion, and she may have relations with him, and she shall be removed from other Jews.</b>  When the sages saw that women were lying and using these claims to leave their husbands because they wanted to marry someone else, they came up with other solutions to these problems.  These solutions did not allow the woman to force her husband to divorce her and pay her ketubah. 1) If she says that she has been raped, she must bring proof.  Until she does so, she is not believed and she is not prohibited to her husband, nor is he forced to divorce her. 2) If she complains that her husband cannot function sexually, the sages should try to bring them together with words of reconciliation.  This may have been the rabbinic equivalent of going to a sex therapist. 3) If she says that she made a vow not to have sex with Jews, the husband may annul that part of the vow that prohibits her from having sex specifically with him, and she will be prohibited from having sex with other Jews, even should she be subsequently divorced. Congratulations!  We have finished Nedarim. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Despite the fact that some of these mishnayoth may have been slightly obscure, we should remember what an important role vows played in the religious life of Jews in the mishnaic and talmudic periods.  Vows were a way of turning everyday matters into issues of greater significance, from matters between human beings and other human beings, to matter between human beings and God.  Learning the laws of vows, and especially how to get out of vows, shows us how humans can make mistakes, get out of them, and yet retain their ultimate covenant with God.  Congratulations on making it through this difficult tractate.  May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more Mishnah!  Tomorrow we begin Nazir."
