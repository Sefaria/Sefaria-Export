            "The laws of the Sotah, the suspected adulteress, are dealt with in Numbers 5:11-31.  As they are related in these verses, the procedure is that a man suspects that his wife has been unfaithful to him.  The Torah describes him as having a “fit of jealousy”.  To find out if his wife has truly been with another man, he brings her to a priest in the Temple, who makes her undergo a “test”, sometimes called an ordeal.  The test involves her drinking water which has had mixed into it some earth from the Temple floor and the ink from curses that were written onto a scroll and then rubbed off.  The test also involves her taking an oath that she has not committed adultery.  She is told that if she lies she will become a cursed woman.  There is also an offering of grain that accompanies the test.  The test will resolve if she was faithful or not.  If she was faithful, she shall become pregnant. But if she was unfaithful, she will be disfigured.  ",
            "There are many scholarly commentaries on this passage.  A good suggestion would be Jacob Milgrom’s commentary on Numbers, published by JPS.  A somewhat abbreviated version can be found in Etz Chaim, the Torah commentary used in most Conservative synagogues. The commentaries delve much more deeply into the ritual itself, explaining the symbolism of its elements. They also compare it to other ordeals known in the ancient world, most famously that a suspected adulterous was thrown into a river.  If she truly committed adultery, she would die.  These kinds of ordeals and distrust of women’s sexuality are difficult for modern readers who are sensitive to men’s domination of women.  After all, there is no parallel test for men’s faithfulness.  This is not the place for a feminist reading of or commentary on the Sotah passage, but I would suggest that people interested read one of the available feminist Torah commentaries.   ",
            "There are two main ways in which the rabbis have reinterpreted these verses, both of which demonstrate two key rabbinic values.  First of all, the simple sense of the Torah is that the husband is only jealous, and based on his jealous rage alone, he can force his wife to go through this trying ordeal.  It does not seem that he needs to bring any proof.  The rabbis, on the other hand, force the husband to go through a procedure before he can bring his wife to be tested through the Sotah waters. He must first warn her not to seclude herself with a certain man, and then she must go and seclude herself with that same man.  There must be witnesses to both of these procedures.  These steps make it more likely that the woman has truly committed adultery, and that she is not just a victim of a jealous rage.  ",
            "However, the rabbis also make the Sotah ceremony more disgraceful for the woman.  Since, according to the procedure prescribed by the rabbis, it is very likely that the sotah is actually guilty of adultery, the rabbis call for her to be publicly shamed.  Adultery is one of the worst crimes in Judaism and in many religions.  The rabbis see the sotah ceremony as a means of warning women not to be unfaithful to their husbands.",
            "Finally, the rabbis also give the woman the right to refuse to drink the Sotah waters.   While this refusal will cause her to lose her ketubah, a husband can never force his wife to go through this ordeal.",
            "By the time of the late Second Temple period, this ordeal was no longer in practice.  ",
            "Only the first part of tractate Sotah deals with the Sotah ritual.  Through an associative process, the Mishnah talks about a wide array of other rituals.  We shall explain their connection when we get to them.",

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nNumbers 5:14 states, “And a fit of jealousy came upon him and he was jealous about his wife.”  The phrase “and he was jealous” is an active verb in Hebrew, and not an adjectival phrase as I have translated it in English.  It is as if the verse states “and he jealoused his wife”.  The rabbis understand this active verb not to be a state of mind of the husband but rather a warning that the husband states to his wife not to associate with a certain man, the man about whom he has suspicions.  Throughout, I will translate this verb “kine” as “warn”.  Our mishnah discusses this process.  Again, we should note that the sotah ritual cannot be enacted unless there is some type of legal procedure that precedes it.  This legal procedure makes it more likely that the husband’s suspicions are true.\nThis mishnah and many others refer to the “bitter waters”.  This is the water that the Sotah must drink as part of her test.  The phrase comes from Number 5:23.",
                    "<b>One who warns his wife [not to associate with a certain man]: Rabbi Eliezer says: he warns her on the testimony of two witnesses, and makes her drink [the bitter waters] on the testimony of one witness or on his own testimony. Rabbi Joshua says: he warns her on the testimony of two and makes her drink on the testimony of two.</b> In tomorrow’s mishnah we shall see that the “warning” is a two-part procedure.  First the husband must warn her not to associate with a certain man.  If after this warning she is secluded with that very man, the husband can take her to the Temple for her to undergo the Sotah test.  Without both steps, the Sotah ritual cannot be enacted. In our mishnah, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua debate regarding the testimony necessary for each step.  Both rabbis agree that he must warn her in front of two witnesses, the usual number for any legal procedure.  They disagree with regard to her seclusion, the final step that will lead the husband to bring her to drink the bitter waters.  According to Rabbi Eliezer, even the husband may testify that she was secluded with the man about whom she was warned, and thereby bring her to the Temple to undergo the Sotah test.  Rabbi Joshua holds that just as “warning” requires two witnesses, so too does her the final step that will cause her to have to drink the bitter waters."

                    "<b>How does he warn her?<br>If he says to her in front of two [witnesses], “Do not speak with that man”, and she spoke with him, she is still permitted to her husband and permitted to eat terumah.<br>If she entered a private place with him and stayed with him a time sufficient for her to be defiled [by having sexual intercourse with him], she is forbidden to her husband  and forbidden to eat terumah. If [her husband] died, she performs halitzah but cannot contract yibbum.</b><br>Yesterday’s mishnah taught that a husband cannot bring his wife to drink the Sotah waters unless he has first warned her not to seclude herself with a certain man.  Today’s mishnah teaches what constitutes warning and what constitutes her transgression of his warning, such that she is brought to be tested.<br>Section one:  The husband is overly strict in his warning.  He suspects that she may be having an adulterous affair with a certain man, so he warns her in front of two witnesses not to even speak with this man.  The mishnah teaches that even if she speaks with this man, she is not considered a Sotah.  She is still permitted to her husband and, if her husband is a priest, she may still eat terumah.  A man cannot prevent his wife from speaking to other men.<br>Section two:  However, if he warned her, and she entered a secluded place with that man, then she is a Sotah, meaning a woman who must be tested before her innocence can be established.  Since, she is now under the presumption of being an adulteress, she can no longer have intercourse with her husband.  This is according to the rule that adultery forbids a woman from returning to her husband.  If she is a priest’s wife, she can no longer eat terumah, since she may no longer be permitted to remain his wife.  The woman is still his wife, but the normalcy of their marriage has ceased and therefore, to be strict, the halakhah forbids them to continue to act as man and wife.  The fact that she still is his wife is evident from the last halakhah of the mishnah.  If her husband died without children and she had a brother, she can no longer undergo the Sotah ritual.  She is still required to have halitzah with her husband’s brother, because were she to have undergone the ritual she may have been found to be innocent, in which case the marriage would have returned to normal.  However, she cannot have yibbum, because she may have actually been guilty.  A wife prohibited to her husband as a Sotah is also prohibited to her yavam.<br>Note, that this last halakhah is the means by which the mishnah teaches that she is still married to her husband and that the fact that she is prohibited to him and cannot eat terumah are stringencies lest she is actually guilty."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThere are some women who may be suspected of adultery but who do not have the opportunity or the obligation to drink the Sotah waters which would test her innocence or guilt.  Had they passed the test, these women would have been allowed to return to being permitted to have intercourse with their husbands and, if married to a priest, to eat terumah.  However, since they can’t drink the water, they cannot stay married to their husbands, nor can they eat terumah.",
                    "<b>The following are prohibited to eat terumah:<br>She who says [to her husband], “I am unclean to you”, and witnesses came [and testified] that she was unclean;</b>  The Sotah ritual is meant to test a case where adultery is questionable.  If the woman admits that she committed adultery, the ritual is no longer necessary and hence forbidden.  Note that in the last mishnah in  Nedarim, the mishnah ruled that a woman who states “I am unclean to you” is not forbidden to her husband.  However, in this mishnah, after her husband had warned her, it is more likely that she really has committed adultery and therefore she is forbidden to her husband. The Talmud notes that it is obvious that if witnesses came that she is not a Sotah.  Witnesses who testify to her having committed adultery certify her as an adulterous, and not a “suspected adulteress”.  Therefore, the Talmud understands that the mishnah refers to a situation where she has already undergone the Sotah ritual and seemingly has not been ill-effected by the bitter waters, and then witnesses came and testified that she was unclean.  The Talmud rules that the witnesses who state her guilt are greater than the waters which state her innocence.  This is another example of the remarkable power given to human beings in rabbinic law.  The divine, magical test of the bitter waters is less accurate than the normal human measure of testimony.",
                    "<b>She who says, “I refuse to drink [the water]”.</b>  The husband cannot force his wife to undergo the Sotah ritual, a ritual that as we shall see was humiliating and probably frightening for the woman.  Her husband must divorce her and he need not pay her ketubah, but he cannot force her to drink the bitter waters.",
                    "<b>She whose husband does not want to make her drink [the water]:</b>  In this case, the husband does not want to make her drink the bitter waters, but she wants to.  Perhaps he regrets having suspected his wife, or perhaps he himself will be embarrassed when everyone sees that he has made his wife into a Sotah.  The mishnah rules that although he doesn’t want her to drink the waters, he cannot return to having her as his wife.  Once he has gone through the process of warning her and her having been caught secluded with that person, it is too late to resume the marriage.  He must divorce her, and since he is the one who doesn’t want her to drink, he must pay her the ketubah.",
                    "<b>And she whose husband had intercourse with her on the journey. How does [the husband] deal with her? He brings her to the court in the place where he resides, and they assign to him two disciples of the sages lest he have intercourse with her on the journey. Rabbi Judah says, her husband is trusted with her.</b>  From the moment that she has been secluded with the man about whom she was warned, she and her husband are prohibited from having sexual relations.  Just as adulterous women may not return to their husbands, so too suspected adulteresses may not.  If he nevertheless has sexual relations with her on his way to the Temple to test her, he has committed a sin.  The Talmud teaches that the Sotah ritual only works for a husband who is free from transgression.  A husband who himself has transgressed the laws of forbidden sexual relations, may not bring his wife to test her. The mishnah is also stating that a husband cannot accuse his wife of being an adulteress and then keep living with her as usual. That would be hypocritical. This is a small measure of egalitarianism in Mishnah Sotah. We shall also see later the idea that just as the waters check her, they check him as well. The mishnah notes a problem.  How can the husband accompany his wife on their way to Jerusalem to the Temple, without transgressing the prohibition?  The fear is that while traveling and being secluded at night, the husband will have relations with her.  The solution is that two disciples of the sages accompany them on their trip. Rabbi Judah holds that a husband is trusted not to have relations with his wife at times when she is prohibited to him."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThe mishnah now begins to describe the process of bringing the sotah to the Temple.  First the judges warn her just how serious the ceremony and its consequences are.  The point of this admonition and of all of what they say to her is to convince her to admit to her guilt so that the name of God will not be rubbed out from the scroll onto the water, as mandates the ceremony.",
                    "<b>They bring her up to the great court which is in Jerusalem, and [the judges] solemnly admonish her in the same way that they admonish witnesses in capital cases. And they say to her, “My daughter, much is done by wine does much, much is done by frivolity, much is done by youth, much is done by bad neighbors. For the sake of His great name which is written in holiness do it so that it may not be rubbed out on the water.” And they say to her matters which neither she nor all the family of her father's house is worthy to hear.</b> In capital cases, the judges warn the witnesses that if they testify falsely, an innocent man will be executed.  Similarly, here they warn the woman, that if she lies drastic results will occur.  For the warning given to witnesses, see Sanhedrin 4:5. The judges also tell her that many things might have caused her to commit adultery and while these do not excuse her sin, they make her sin more understandable.  They are telling her that she should not be shamed of admitting her guilt.  They implore her not to go through with the ceremony, because part of the ceremony involves writing God’s name on a scroll and then rubbing it out. This is a great desecration and should only be done under the most dire of circumstances. Finally, they tell her things which the mishnah doesn’t even want to mention.  Note that according to the mishnah, her family came along with her.  Assumedly they are there to defend her, and hope that she is found innocent. The Talmud relates that they tell her stories where Biblical characters admitted to their sins. For example, Judah admits that he sinned with Tamar (Genesis 39:26)."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah begins to describe the Sotah ritual.  I should make at this point a general note about the process.  We are going to encounter now a ceremony that was intended to disgrace the woman.  I believe that the rabbis thought that by disgracing women who actually went through with the ceremony, they would discourage the ceremony from ever taking place.  Furthermore, the public humiliation would serve to deter others from committing the same crimes. Finally, as I pointed out in the introduction to Sotah, it is likely that this woman has indeed committed adultery, for she secluded herself with the same man about whom her husband warned her.  Nevertheless, we should appreciate how harsh the process is for the woman and that especially for the innocent woman who would have been dragged through the process, it would have been a trauma.",
                    "<b>If she said, “I am defiled to you”, she gives him a receipt for her ketubah and goes out [with a get].</b>  If, after the warnings are stated to her, she admits that she did commit adultery, she does not drink the Sotah waters.  Rather, she loses her ketubah, gives her husband a receipt for the ketubah (even though she didn’t receive it), and is divorced.  Note that she is not tried as an adulterer since, even if there were witnesses, she was not warned about the consequences of her act when she committed adultery.  In general, as we learned in Sanhedrin, it is exceedingly difficult in Jewish law to convict a person of a capital crime.",
                    "<b>But if she says, “I am pure”, they bring her up to the east gate, Nicanor’s gate, where they give women suspected of adultery the water to drink, purify women after childbirth and purify lepers.</b>  If she continues to insist that she is innocent, she is brought to the east gate of the Temple.  The mishnah notes that two other ceremonies were also performed at this gate.  There women who had given birth waited while the priests offered their sacrifices which are mandatory for a woman to purify herself after birth (Leviticus 12:6-7) and there lepers waited while priests offered their purificatory sacrifices (Leviticus 14:11).  Neither lepers nor women who had given birth could go further into the Temple courtyards since they were impure until their sacrifices were offered.",
                    "<b>A priest seizes her clothing if they are torn, then they are torn, and if they become unstitched, then they are unstitched, until he uncovers her bosom, and he undoes [the braids of] her hair. Rabbi Judah says: if her bosom was beautiful he does not uncover it, and if her hair was beautiful he does not undo it.</b>  The mishnah prescribes that the priest publicly shame her.  Part of the function of this process was to deter others from committing the same sin.  By publicly at least partially stripping her and undoing her hair, the nature of her crime would be literally and figuratively laid bare to all. Rabbi Judah seems to note that this process may have had an opposite effect.  While it is intended to deter others it may have served as a source of titillation. Therefore, if the effect of baring her bosom, or undoing her hair would serve to arouse others for she is a beautiful woman, it is not to be done."

                    "<b>Whoever wishes to look upon her comes to look with the exception of her male and female slaves, since she has no shame in front of them.</b>  The mishnah allows, indeed encourages, the Sotah to be made into a public spectacle.  Anyone who wishes to look at her can do so. The only exceptions are her male and female slaves, for they are accustomed to seeing her at her most intimate moments.  Seeing them might encourage her not to admit to her crime, and one of the goals of the ceremony is for her to crime.",
                    "<b>All of the women are permitted to look upon her, as it is said, “That all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness” (Ezekiel 23:48).</b>  The Talmud understands that not only are other women permitted to look at her, but they are actually obligated to look at her.  This is learned from Ezekiel who says that other women shall see the adulteress punished and will not repeat her crimes.  Note that the chapter in Ezekiel uses the metaphor of adultery to describe Israel’s “whoring” itself after foreign Gods. The vivid descriptions of her crimes and the description of her punishment are reflections of the punishment of adulteresses."

So too, the Torah’s punishments for the Sotah are commensurate with her crimes.  The mishnah now illustrates this.  She is made repulsive, her clothes are ripped and her hair is torn, in response to her adorning herself in preparation for adultery.  She is exposed for all to see, because she exposed herself to her lover.  Finally, the Torah states that if the waters find her to be guilty, her thigh and then womb (belly) will be disfigured. These are two of the areas of her body that were involved in the affair.  She exposed to him her thigh, which is often understood to be the genitalia, and then she allowed him to enter her womb. The mishnah notes that this is only the beginning of her curse.  She should not think that only her thigh and belly will be disfigured. Rather they are just the start."

Joseph buried his father and as a reward, Moses took Joseph’s bones out of Egypt so that they could be buried in the promised land.  As a reward for ensuring that Joseph’s bones received a proper burial, God Himself took care of burying Moses. The mishnah ends by stating that this is not only a history lesson but a message for the future as well.  God takes care of the burial of the righteous.  I can’t help but think about the many Jews (and righteous Gentiles, for the mishnah does not limit this to Jews) who in the past century have not receive proper burials.

We should remember that in the past century great advances were made in providing women with proper education in Torah.  Some of the statements in this mishnah are, to put it mildly, not flattering to women and do not reflect the society in which we live or women’s place in that society.  In my commentary on this mishnah I shall not delve deeply into this issue and the different ways in which this mishnah has been understood.  Rather I refer the reader to Judith Hauptman’s excellent book “Rereading the Rabbis”.  Professor Hauptman teaches at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and her book contains some sensible statements on this mishnah in particular and on the rabbi’s attitudes’ towards women in general.   Another interesting book, although very different than Hauptman’s, is Daniel Boyarin’s classic “Carnal Israel”, which also contains a chapter on women studying Torah.",

The people who see her scream that she must immediately be removed, lest she defile the Temple.  I should note that this defilement is probably not of the typical ritual defilement, but rather a type of moral defilement.  The Torah often describes three sins which defile but not in the same way that things such as a dead body, menstruation or leprosy defile ritually:  murder, sexual sins (adultery and incest) and idol worship.  These sins defile in such a way that their defilement cannot be easily removed through a standard purificatory process (i.e. a mikveh).  As an adulteress, this woman’s mere presence in the Temple is perceived as dangerous.",

It is hard to tell whether the mishnah expects that such effect can be delayed indefinitely.  The Talmud lists some ways in which a woman can gain merit and thereby defer the effects of the water.  Besides Torah study which the sages debate below, the ways that the Talmud anticipates a woman’s merit involve her children or her husband.  For instance, she can bring her children to school, or wait for her husband outside when she anticipates that he will be returning from a journey.",

This is after all, perhaps the highest value in the rabbinic value system.  However, the rabbis debate whether or not she should learn Torah.  According to Ben Azzai, a father should teach his daughter Torah.  His reasoning is somewhat strange.  He holds that she should learn Torah so that if she drinks the waters and they do not take effect, she will not believe that the waters are ineffective but rather she will chalk it up to her Torah study.  Doubt about the waters may cause her to believe that in the future she could get away with adultery again.

There are four types of people that destroy the world: 1) A foolish pietist.  This is illustrated as a man who for matters of modesty does not rescue a drowning woman. 2) A cunning wicked person.  One way that this is illustrated is that he is lenient when he makes rulings for himself and stringent when it comes to rulings for other people. 3) The word which I have translated as “separatist” can also be translated as “Pharisee”, but I believe that in this mishnah it does not refer to a woman who was a member of this Second Temple political party.  Rather, it refers to a woman who separates herself too much from sexual relations.  Abstinence is not the ideal proposed by Rabbi Joshua, nor almost any rabbi. Rather his ideal is one of moderation. 4) In this clause the “separatists” probably does refer to the Pharisees.   Rabbi Joshua is referring to hypocritical Pharisees, who strike and flagellate themselves in order to make themselves look pious, when in reality they are not so. We can see that Rabbi Joshua portrays an ideal of religious honesty and moderation and is deeply skeptical of outward acts of zealousness.  This attitude of inner, rational, non-zealous piety is, in my mind, the ideal portrayal of the righteous Jew."

What is most interesting about Rabbi Shimon’s position is that his argument is practical.  If the effects were suspended, the test would be rendered far less effective.  First of all, women will not fear drinking the water, for they will reason that their accumulated merit will aid them in avoiding their punishment.  This is similar to Rabbi Eliezer’s argument not to teach daughter’s Torah, which we saw in the previous mishnah.  Secondly, not only will the waters not have their desired effect in deterring potential adulteresses, they will not clear the good name of women who are truly innocent.  People who see that the woman who drank the water has not been affected will assume that it was because of her merits, and not because of her overall innocence.",

Merit does suspend the effects of the water, but not absolutely.  It only slows down the slow process of disfigurement, the curse mentioned in the Torah.  If the woman were innocent, she would become pregnant and give birth, as is promised in Numbers 5:28.  However, if she is guilty but has some merit, she will not give birth, her condition will not improve, but rather she will slowly deteriorate until she dies from the type of death promised to her by the Torah.  In this way, even though merit does suspend the effect, this does not discredit the effect of the bitter waters, nor does it cause people to be suspicious of pure women."

A betrothed woman does not have such a status and hence, even if her fiancé forbids her from being secluded with a certain man and afterwards she is secluded with him, she does not undergo the sotah ordeal.  Similarly, a “shomeret yavam”, a woman whose husband died childless and is waiting for either levirate marriage (yibbum) or the release from levirate marriage (halitzah), does not drink the bitter waters.

The Talmud explains that Beth Shammai views a debt document (which a ketubah is) as if it has already been collected.  Therefore the money stated in the ketubah is already hers, and unless the husband’s heirs can prove otherwise, she gets to collect.  Since they can’t prove that she committed adultery, the ketubah belongs to her. Beth Hillel holds that she loses her ketubah.

The Sages hold that the marriage is not truly prohibited, because he may remain married to her while at the same time staying separate from her (sexually) for two years.

According to the story, when Rabban Gamaliel was head of the Sanhedrin, he limited access to the study sessions.  When R. Elazar ben Azarya took over, he opened the doors and that day became a day of great Torah learning.

The verse uses the word “yitma”, which if vocalized differently could be read “yetame”, which means “will make unclean”.  Rabbi Akiva uses this proposed alternative vocalization to conclude that something which falls into an unclean vessel makes other things unclean.  The thing that falls into the vessel has “second degree” defilement, and that which it makes impure becomes defiled in the “third degree”, a lesser form of defilement.  What defiled the vessel was a primary source of impurity, such as a creepy crawly thing, a menstruant, a zav, etc.  The primary source of impurity made the vessel into a first degree defiler, which made the loaf into a second degree, which when it comes into contact with other things will give them third degree defilement.",

In the first mishnah of the tractate we learned that the husband must first warn her not to be secluded with a certain man, and then she must be secluded with that man.  Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua debate whether witnesses are needed to testify that she was secluded with that man in order for her to become a sotah.  According to Rabbi Eliezer, witnesses are not necessary.  However, in the absence of witnesses the husband himself must see that she was secluded.  According to Rabbi Joshua, two witnesses are necessary.  In our mishnah, these same two tannaim debate whether or not the woman is prohibited to her husband if there is just a rumor that she was secluded.  Although without at least some witnessing she cannot become a sotah, such that she drinks the water, a rumor might, under certain circumstances, be sufficient to cause her to be prohibited to her husband.",

He then heard a rumor that she had secluded herself with the suspected man.  The husband heard the rumor from “a flying bird”, which means that he had no idea where the rumor came from.  This is not sufficient for the husband to make her drink the sotah waters.  Nevertheless, according to Rabbi Eliezer this is sufficient to cause her to be forbidden to him due to suspected adultery.  In any case, since he does not have any evidence that she was indeed secluded, he must pay her the ketubah.",

The mishnah notes that this is counterintuitive, for the second type of testimony is surely more consequential.  Therefore, it proves this halakhah using strict exegetical methods, methods which are allowed to be counterintuitive.",

These two witnesses must testify that they saw her secluded with the man with whom her husband warned her not to be secluded.  If two valid witnesses testify that she is secluded with him, her husband brings her to the Temple to drink the sotah waters, which will determine her guilt or innocence. If she is found innocent, she may return to normal married life.  In other words, the result of their testimony may be temporary.  However, only one witness is needed to testify that she actually committed adultery, as we learned in yesterday’s mishnah.  Seemingly this testimony should require two witnesses for its results are permanent.  After testimony that she was defiled by committing adultery, she may never return to her husband.  This is the “logical” problem brought up in section one of the mishnah.",

Deuteronomy 24:1 states that if a man finds in his wife “an unseemly matter”, he may divorce her.  The midrash assumes that this “unseemly matter” refers to her having been secluded with the suspected other man.  The word “matter” is connected with the same word used in Deuteronomy 19:15, which states that two witnesses are required in order for any “matter” to stand.

The second section teaches that proximity of the corpse to certain cities also does not require the heifer’s neck to be broken.\nWe should note that the fact that the rabbis were quite willing to limit the applicability of the neck-breaking ceremony demonstrates that they were far less concerned with blood atonement than Israelites were in ancient times.   The need for blood atonement was prominent in biblical theology and law, and played less of a role in rabbinic thinking.",

The Talmud explains that these places are considered dangerous and therefore, by going near there, the victim was not acting in a safe manner.  Hence, if he is slain, assumedly by enemies, there is no communal guilt incurred by the Jewish city closest to the corpse. However, if the corpse was found near a city in which there is no court, they would still bring a heifer, and they would measure to the nearest city which does have a court.  Since the Torah requires members of the court of the nearest city to go out and participate in the neck-breaking ceremony, the city which brings the heifer obviously must have a court. Rabbi Eliezer states that if the corpse is found exactly between two cities, both cities would bring a heifer and breaks its neck.  In the Talmud a different opinion is brought, and that is that the two cities equidistant from the corpse share in bringing one heifer.  Perhaps these two different opinions have different concepts of the neck-breaking ceremony.  Rabbi Eliezer would claim that it is essential that each city which is closest must bring a heifer in order to cleanse its guilt.  The responsibility is intended for the people of the city to bring a heifer, and since we don’t know which city is closest, both must bring.  The other opinion would hold that the critical thing is that a heifer’s neck is broken in order to atone for the blood of the victim.

Rabbi Eliezer implies that the body is the important part, and therefore the head is brought to it, whereas Rabbi Akiva implies that the head is the important part, and therefore the body is brought to it. What seems certain to me is that there is a level to this debate deeper than the mere technical details.  In other words in this halakhah Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva are expressing deeper values.  What is uncertain is what those values are.  One suggestion which occurred to me is that Rabbi Eliezer is operating according to a principle of “quantity”.  Since the body is larger than the head, the head is brought to the body.  In contrast, Rabbi Akiva operates according to a principle of essentiality/quality.  The head is what governs the body.  The head governs the remainder.  Furthermore, it is what generally gives human beings their identity; people are recognized by their faces.  Therefore, the body is brought to their head."

In a time when many men were committing adultery, the water-drinking ceremony was discontinued.  This is based on a midrash found elsewhere on Numbers 5:31, “The man shall be clear of guilt; but that woman shall suffer for her guilt.”  The midrash on this verse says that the waters are effective in testing the woman, only if the husband is free of guilt.

Yohanan the high priest ended this practice. There are two explanations given for why he ended the practice. The first is that he saw that people were no longer separating tithes, and they were only separating terumah. The second is that the tithes were no longer given to the Levites but rather to the priests.  This is because when Ezra came to Israel from Babylonia, the priests did not come with him.

These Levites were called the “wakers”.  The practice was abolished because it gives the impression that God is sleeping, and Psalms 121:4 says, “See, the guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps.” The “knockers” refers to a practice of striking a sacrificial heifer between its horns in order to prepare it for sacrifice.

He would also separate the first and second tithe but these he could eat them himself.  Since these tithes may have already been taken out before he bought the produce, the Levite cannot prove that the first tithe belongs to him, nor can the poor person prove that the poor tithe belongs to him. Therefore, he can retain these tithes for himself.   Before Yohanan’s time, people had to ask those selling produce if it was tithed, and they would have to decide whether the person was trustworthy.

In the previous mishnah, it was the loss of the Temple that caused food to lose its taste. The Temple was the meeting place of Israel and God and without it people can no longer have contact with the divine.  In contrast, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar understands the observance of commandments as the mechanism that brings taste to one’s life.

                    "<b>During the final war they decreed that a bride should not go out in a palanquin inside the city, but our rabbis decreed that a bride may go out in a palanquin inside the city.</b>  In the last war, they decreed that a bride should no longer use a palanquin, a covered seat carried on poles which is held parallel to the ground on the shoulders of two or four people (according to the Encarta Dictionary).  This seat is mentioned in Song of Songs 3:9.  However, in a later period “our rabbis”, identified by Maimonides as Rabbi Judah Hanasi, decreed that the bride may again use the palanquin.  The Talmud explains that since the palanquin preserved the bride’s modesty, it was allowed."

Because he was the youngest of the pious men.<br>When Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai died, the splendor of wisdom ceased.<br>When Rabban Gamaliel the elder died, the glory of the torah ceased, and purity and separateness perished.<br>When Rabbi Ishmael ben Fabi died, the splendor of the priesthood ceased.<br>When Rabbi died, humility and fear of sin ceased.<br>Rabbi Phineas ben Yair says: when Temple was destroyed, scholars and freemen were ashamed and covered their head, men of wondrous deeds were disregarded, and violent men and big talkers grew powerful.  And nobody expounds, nobody seeks, and nobody asks.   Upon whom shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven.<br>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: from the day the Temple was destroyed, the sages began to be like scribes, scribes like synagogue-attendants, synagogue-attendants like common people, and the common people became more and more debased.  And nobody seeks. Upon whom shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven.  In the footsteps of the messiah insolence ( will increase and the cost of living will go up greatly; the vine will yield its fruit, but wine will be expensive; the government will turn to heresy, and there will be no one to rebuke; the meeting-place [of scholars] will be used for licentiousness; the Galilee will be destroyed, the Gablan will be desolated, and the dwellers on the frontier will go about [begging] from place to place without anyone to take pity on them; the wisdom of the learned will rot, fearers of sin will be despised, and the truth will be lacking; youths will put old men to shame, the old will stand up in the presence of the young, “For son spurns father, daughter rises up against mother, daughter-in-law against mother-in-law a man’s own household are his enemies” (Micah 7:6). The face of the generation will be like the face of a dog, a son will not feel ashamed before his father. Upon whom shall we depend? Upon our father who is in heaven.<br>Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair says, “Heedfulness leads to cleanliness, cleanliness leads to purity, purity leads to separation, separation leads to holiness, holiness leads to modesty, modesty leads to fear of sin, fear of sin leads to piety, piety leads to the Holy Spirit, The Holy Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead, and the resurrection of the dead comes from Elijah, blessed be his memory, Amen.”</b><br>The previous several mishnayoth discussed various historical events and what ceased at those times.  The first section of the mishnah teaches what ceased when the great teachers of Torah of the mishnaic period died.<br>The second and third sections contain laments at the great deterioration that Israel experienced when the Temple was destroyed.  The last part of the third section and the final section contain messages of hope for better times.<br>Some of these sections are self-explanatory.  Therefore, I will only comment when there is something to add.<br>Sections 1-3:  In the first three sections, when rabbis die who exemplify certain characteristics of Torah learners, the world is bereft of men like them. Rabbi Meir was known for his fables, Ben Azzai for his extreme dedication to study and Ben Zoma was a great expounder of biblical verses (you may remember him from the haggadah).<br>Section four:  Rabbi Joshua died right around the time of the beginning of the Bar-Kochba revolt, a bitter loss for the Jews.  This may be the meaning of “goodness ceased from the world.”<br>Section six:  Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah was very wealthy and helped support many other Torah scholars.<br>Section seven:  Rabbi Akiva expounded upon every letter in the Torah and even every mark made on top of each letter.  This is the “glory of the Torah”, that everything in it has a meaning.<br>Section nine:  The “pious men” may refer to individually pious men, but it also may refer to a radical group of Pharisees known as “hasidim.”<br>Section eleven:  Rabban Gamaliel the Elder lived while the Temple still stood.  Separateness may refer to asceticism.<br>Section fourteen:  Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair laments the deterioration that occurred after the destruction of the Temple.  The good people were disregarded and led to shame while the violent and those who talked more than they did thrived.  At the end of his statement he notes that we have no choice but to continue relying on God.  This is this mishnah’s note of hope. Despite the deep traumas experienced by the Jews in this period, traumas that dislocated them from their center of worship in Jerusalem and caused a great loss of life, the rabbis continued to believe in God and to study the Torah. Without them, we would not be here today.<br>Section fifteen:  This section is really the last section of the mishnah, causing the tractate to end on a negative note.  In order to prevent this, later copyists added a more upbeat ending to the Mishnah.  Rabbi Eliezer the Great again speaks of the deterioration after the destruction.  However, there may be some optimism in his words themselves.  The phrase “in the footsteps of the messiah” refers to his belief that the great suffering currently being experienced is a sign of the eminent messianic period.  These are the “birthpangs of the Messiah”.  Rabbi Eliezer closes both sections of his remarks by noting that we have nothing to do but rely on God’s grace.<br>Section sixteen: This section is a later addition to the Mishnah, one meant to add hope after such a bitter chapter. The saying provides a prescription for bringing about the return of Elijah, the harbinger of the Messiah.  It all begins with simple “heedfulness”, which could be understood as passion for observance of the commandments.<br>Congratulations!  We have finished Sotah.<br>It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives.<br>Sotah was, at least in my opinion, an extremely interesting tractate.  The tractate was full of midrash, explaining the sotah ritual and several other important biblical passages.  It ended with some fascinating historical material. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.<br>May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more Mishnah!  Tomorrow we begin Gittin."
