            "Bekhorot means first-born (almost the same word as Bikkurim, first fruits). Our tractate deals with three different types of first-borns, each with their own particular rules.",
            "1) The first-born of a donkey. Exodus 13:11-13 (full text below) says that the male first-born of a donkey must be redeemed with a sheep, meaning that the sheep becomes holy. According to Numbers 18:15-18 and other verses in Numbers (see below) the first born of every impure (non-edible) animal must be redeemed. This would include camels, horses and other domesticated but impure animals. There were some ancient Jews, including some rabbis, who thought that all impure animals must be redeemed. However, the halakhah dictated that only the first-born of donkeys needs to be redeemed.",
            "2) The male first-born of a pure animal. This first-born as the status of a sacrifice, as we learned in Tractate Zevahim. If it is blemished it cannot be sacrificed, but it still must be given to the priest.",
            "3) The male first-born of a human being. This first-born is redeemed by giving five shekels to the priest.",
            "In addition, Bekhorot finishes with a chapter dedicated to the cattle tithe, the giving of the tenth-born of every domesticated animal to the priest. ",
            "Below are the verses that are relevant to the topic of bekhorot. As you can see, this is a topic that receives quite a bit of “coverage” in the Torah.",
            "Exodus 13   2 \"Consecrate to Me every first-born; man and beast, the first issue of every womb among the Israelites is Mine.\"",
            "Exodus 13 11 \"And when the LORD has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and has given it to you,  12 you shall set apart for the LORD every first issue of the womb: every male firstling that your cattle drop shall be the LORD's.  13 But every firstling ass you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. And you must redeem every first-born male among your children.",
            "Exodus 22 28 You shall not put off the skimming of the first yield of your vats. You shall give Me the first-born among your sons.  29 You shall do the same with your cattle and your flocks: seven days it shall remain with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me.",
            "Exodus 34 19 Every first issue of the womb is Mine, from all your livestock that drop a male as firstling, whether cattle or sheep.  20 But the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. And you must redeem every first-born among your sons. None shall appear before Me empty-handed.",
            "Leviticus 27 26 A firstling of animals, however, which -- as a firstling -- is the LORD's, cannot be consecrated by anybody; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD's.",
            "Numbers 3 13 For every first-born is Mine: at the time that I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt, I consecrated every first-born in Israel, man and beast, to Myself, to be Mine, the LORD's.",
            "Numbers 18 15 The first issue of the womb of every being, man or beast, that is offered to the LORD, shall be yours; but you shall have the first-born of man redeemed, and you shall also have the firstling of unclean animals redeemed.  16 Take as their redemption price, from the age of one month up, the money equivalent of five shekels by the sanctuary weight, which is twenty gerahs.  17 But the firstlings of cattle, sheep, or goats may not be redeemed; they are consecrated. You shall dash their blood against the altar, and turn their fat into smoke as an offering by fire for a pleasing odor to the LORD.  18 But their meat shall be yours: it shall be yours like the breast of elevation offering and like the right thigh.",
            "Deuteronomy 15 19 You shall consecrate to the LORD your God all male firstlings that are born in your herd and in your flock: you must not work your firstling ox or shear your firstling sheep.  20 You and your household shall eat it annually before the LORD your God in the place that the LORD will choose.  21 But if it has a defect, lameness or blindness, any serious defect, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.  22 Eat it in your settlements, the unclean among you no less than the clean, just like the gazelle and the deer.  23 Only you must not partake of its blood; you shall pour it out on the ground like water."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nOur mishnah teaches that donkeys owned, or even partially owned, by non-Jews are exempt from the obligation to have their first-born redeemed.",
                    "<b>[An Israelite] who buys a fetus of a donkey belonging to a non-Jew or who sells one to him, although this is not permitted, or who forms a partnership with him, or who receives [an animal] from him to look after or who gives [his donkey] to him to look after, is exempt from the [law of the] bekhor, for it says: [“I sanctified to me all the firstborn] in Israel,” (Numbers 3:13) but not in non-Jews.</b>  In order for a Jew to be liable to redeem the first-born of a donkey, a non-Jew cannot have any ownership or partial ownership over the donkey. So if a Jew buys a fetus (assumedly he buys a pregnant donkey) from a non-Jew it is exempt from the laws of the first-born, because it was conceived under non-Jewish ownership. Similarly, if he sells the fetus to the non-Jew, it is exempt. The mishnah notes that selling a donkey to a non-Jew is not permitted because it is forbidden to sell a large animal to a non-Jew (see Avodah Zarah 1:6). Nevertheless, if one does sell the donkey, it is exempt. If a Jew and a non-Jew are partners in owning a donkey it is exempt. If a Jew receives a donkey to take care of, and in return he keeps some of the offspring, or if he gives the donkey to the non-Jew to take care of and the non-Jew keeps some of the offspring, in both of these cases, the donkey is exempt because the non-Jew has some level of ownership over the animal. The exemption of non-Jews from these laws is derived from the word “in Israel,” which means that the law of the bekhor applies only to animals fully owned by Israelites.",
                    "<b>Priests and levites are exempt through [an argument made by a] kal vehomer: if they exempted the first-born belonging to the Israelites in the wilderness, it follows all the more so that they should exempt their own.</b>  In Numbers 3:45 God instructs Moses to take the Levites in place of the first-born and to take the cattle of the Levites in place of the cattle of the first-born. From here the mishnah derives a kal vehomer (a fortiori) argument. If the Levites exempted the cattle of the first-born in the desert, then their own first-born animals are all the more so exempt from the law of the bekhor. Thus animals owned by priests and Levites are exempt from these laws. As we shall see, the same holds for children of priests and Levites."

                [
                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nThis mishnah deals with cases where the offspring of an animal is not the same species as the mother.",
                    "<b>If a cow gave birth to a species of donkey, or a donkey gave birth to a species of horse, it is exempt from [the law of] the firstling, for it is said, “the firstling of a donkey,” “the firstling of a donkey,” twice [to teach that the law of the firstling does not apply] until that which gives birth is a donkey and that which is born is a donkey.</b>  In order for the owner of the animal to be liable to redeem the first-born donkey, it must be a donkey (at least look like a donkey) and be born from a donkey. If a cow gives birth to a donkey (I don’t really know if this is possible) or a donkey gives birth to a horse (perhaps the reference is to a mule) then there is no liability. This is derived from the fact that the Torah twice states “the first-born of a donkey” once in Exodus 13:12 and again in Exodus 34:20. The Torah repeats itself, according to the midrashic way of thinking, in order to teach that both the mother and the offspring must be donkeys.",
                    "<b>And what is the law with regard to eating them? If a clean animal gave birth to a species of unclean animal, it is permitted to be eaten. But if an unclean animal gave birth to a species of a clean animal, it is forbidden to be eaten, for that which comes out of the unclean is unclean and that which comes out of the clean is clean.</b>  When it comes to determining whether an animal is kosher, the status of the animal follows its mother. Anything that comes out of a clean (kosher) animal is clean. So if a cow gives birth to a horse, one can eat the horse, but if a horse gives birth to a cow, the cow is not kosher. This is the matrilineal principle in the animal world. As an aside, some scholars surmise that the source of the idea that a child’s ethnicity/religion is determined by his mother is derived from the idea that an animal’s species is determined by its mother. While there is no conclusive proof of this, it is an intriguing theory.",
                    "<b>If an unclean fish swallowed a clean fish, it is permitted to be eaten. But if a clean fish has swallowed an unclean fish, the latter is forbidden to be eaten, because it is not [the clean fish's] growth.</b>  The rule works differently if the animal coming out of another animal was not born but rather swallowed. If a clean fish swallows an unclean fish, and the unclean fish is found in the clean fish’s stomach, one may not eat the unclean fish. The opposite also holds true if one finds a clean fish in the stomach of an unclean fish, it may be eaten."

He must set aside a lamb to redeem the donkey, but he need not give the lamb to the priest. This is because the priest cannot prove that the owner was liable, and there is a rule in monetary matters the burden of proof is upon the claimant. So the lamb stays with its owner.",

The other male might be a first-born, or it might not. The mishnah teaches that since this other male is only doubtfully a first-born he can use one lamb to redeem both the certain first-born and the doubtful first-born. The lamb must be given to a priest.",
                    "<b>[If they gave birth to] two females and a male or to two males and two females the priest receives nothing.</b>  If there were two females, then there is a possibility that the first born of each donkey was a female, no matter how many males were also born. Thus he need not give any lambs to the priest. However, the Tosefta notes that he must set aside one lamb and redeem the males that were born and might have been first-borns. He keeps this lamb for himself, as he did in section two."

So the owner is liable to give one lamb to the priest.",

This is another case where there is doubt about whether the owner owes a lamb to the priest. As in the cases in yesterday’s mishnah, he sets aside a lamb to redeem the male donkey who might need to be redeemed, but he need not give the lamb to the priest, because the priest cannot prove that the male was a first-born.",

As long as this lamb is from a sheep or a goat, it can be used, no matter what type of lamb it is.",

A calf, born of a cow or a wild animal cannot be used. The lamb must be alive when used to redeem the donkey. It cannot be either slaughtered or a terefah (died without being properly slaughtered). Kilayim is a mixed breed. Here it refers to an animal born of a mix between a sheep and a goat. According to the first opinion, a kilayim is not a lamb. A koy is an animal which the rabbis couldn’t identify as either a domesticated or a wild animal (see Hullin 6:1). Since its status is not known, it cannot be used to redeem the first-born donkey.",
                    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer permits [redemption] with kilayim because it is a lamb. But he forbids with a koy, because its nature is doubtful.</b>  Rabbi Eliezer disagrees with regard to the kilayim. Since both a sheep and a goat have offspring that are called “lambs (seh)” this animal can be used. He agrees, however, that a koy cannot be used.",
                    "<b>If he gave [the first-born of a donkey] itself to the priest, the latter may not keep it, until he sets aside a lamb in its place.</b>  He cannot simply give the first-born donkey to the priest.

But the sages say: he is not responsible, as is the case with the redemption of the second tithe.</b>  In this case the lamb used to redeem the first-born of a donkey dies before it can be given to the priest. Rabbi Eliezer says that he must separate a new lamb and give it to the priest. This is the same rule as would apply if he lost the five selas that he must give to the priest in order to redeem his first-born son. To Rabbi Eliezer the donkey is not redeemed until the owner actually gives the lamb to the priest. Until that point the lamb belongs to the owner and if it dies, it is his loss. The other rabbis hold that once the lamb is set aside, the first-born of the donkey has been redeemed. The lamb has now taken the place of the donkey and the only thing missing is giving it to the priest. If the lamb dies now, it is the priest’s loss and he need not give another lamb to the priest. This is the same rule as applies to money used to redeem second tithe produce. Once the produce has been redeemed it is non-sacred and the money is holy. If the money is lost, he need not go back and redeem it again.",

If the lamb dies after it has been set aside to redeem the first-born donkey, the priest doesn’t receive anything.

Therefore, it must be buried and one cannot derive any benefit from its corpse. However, the holiness of the donkey had not yet been transferred to the lamb, because this only happens when the lamb is given to the priest. Therefore, the lamb can still be used. Note that this is consistent with Rabbi Eliezer’s position above. The other rabbis hold that as soon as the lamb is set aside, it takes on the holiness of the donkey. Therefore, it the donkey dies it need not be buried. The lamb, however, must be given to the priest because as soon as he set it aside, it belongs to the priest."

If he does so just because he wants to have relations with her, for his own enjoyment, then, the rabbis claim, it would be better for them to do halitzah. The mishnah presents this as a type of “good old days” scenario. In the “good old days” men had religious intentions when they performed yibbum. In those times, yibbum was preferable. Now they are just plain old sleeping with their dead brother’s wife, and therefore we should encourage halitzah.",

They are brought here in Tractate Bekhorot because they have some rules concerning bekhorot. My commentary, including the following introduction, is the same as that found in Hullin.<br>An animal that has a permanent physical blemish cannot be sacrificed. Our mishnah distinguishes between cases where the blemish preceded the consecration of the animal, versus cases where the consecration preceded the blemish.<br>If the animal had a permanent blemish before it was consecrated, then the animal itself doesn’t become holy. Instead, the consecrator has in reality dedicated the value of the animal to the Temple. Thus this animal is treated like a hullin, non-sacred, animal, except that it has to be redeemed before any use can be made of it. If it gives birth to a firstling, the firstling is holy, as is the case with a hullin animal. When one slaughters it, he must give the shoulder, cheeks and stomach to the priest. After it becomes hullin by being redeemed, it may be shorn and work may be performed with it. Similarly, its young and its milk are not prohibited. One who slaughters it outside the Temple is not liable for he has slaughtered a non-sacred animal. If one tries to exchange it for another animal, the other animal is not holy. If the animal dies, it will still need to be redeemed, so that its meat can be given to dogs.<br>The only exception to all of these rules is if this animal that had a permanent blemish is itself a firstling or a tithed animal. The firstling is holy from the moment it is born even if it has a blemish. Similarly, even blemished animals must be tithed (see Leviticus 27:33). Thus these animals are holy regardless of whether they have blemishes and therefore they cannot be treated as the animals above were treated."

After the Temple was destroyed, this was obviously a very important matter, one of grave economic significance, because other than slaughter and eat the first born, nothing else could be done with it. Indeed, one of the major aspects of rabbinic ordination was allowing a student to become a rabbi in order to allow first borns to be eaten. In order to receive such ordination one must be an expert in determining what animals are blemished and trustworthy to allow the blemished ones and forbid the unblemished ones.<br>Generally, the animal would first be shown to an expert (a rabbi) and then, if the rabbi determined that it was blemished, the animal could be slaughtered and eaten. However, in the case in our mishnah, the person slaughtered it and then brought it to a rabbi. At this point, the rabbi must determine whether there was a blemish on the animal before it was slaughtered.<br>According to Rabbi Judah, if the sage sees such a blemish, the meat may be eaten.

Clearly, this is meant to discourage a non-expert from declaring an animal blemished.<br>Section two: The same is true in other cases of judicial decisions. If a non-expert judge renders a decision and later it is found that he made the wrong decision, he must make restitution from his own pocket. Non-experts should simply not make decisions, and if they do, they run the risk of incurring liability.<br>Section three: The mishnah now brings an interesting story of a mistaken judgment. A cow is brought in front of the sages so that they can determine whether the cow is a terefah, an animal with a wound/disease that would cause it to die within a short period. Such an animal may not be eaten. The sages in Yavneh determined that the animal was indeed a terefah.  After making this determination, Todos, a doctor, testified that in Alexandria they would regularly remove the wombs from cows and pigs before they would allow the animal to leave the city. They would do this because they thought their cows and pigs were of superior breed and they didn’t want others to breed them. In any case, this proves that a cow with its womb removed is not a terefah.<br>Rabbi Tarfon realizes that he has made a mistake and therefore, exclaims to himself, “Tarfon, there goes your donkey!” Rabbi Tarfon is now going to have to sell his donkey to pay back for the loss of the cow.<br>Rabbi Akiva assures Rabbi Tarfon that he has not lost his donkey, because he is an expert, and an expert doesn’t have to make restitution when he renders a mistaken judgment.<br>I don’t know whether the mishnah is intentionally being ironic, but I find it funny that Rabbi Tarfon is an expert, even though he doesn’t know that the halakhah is that he doesn’t have to pay back the loss. In other words, he is an expert despite the fact that he has made two mistakes in one mishnah."

He was also wealthy enough that he didn’t need their payments. A bribe wouldn’t cause him to allow an unblemished animal to be slaughtered.

Meat that they have not eaten should be returned to him and he can either feed it to animals or sell it to non-Jews, since it is permitted to derive benefit (but not eat) a terefah. Obviously, he must pay them back for this meat. If they had already sold the meat to non-Jews or gave it to an animal, then they must pay him the amount that a terefah costs, which is much cheaper than a kosher animal. If they already paid him for kosher meat, he will have to return to them the difference."

A “ba’al gever” is one whose penis is unusually large. Please do not ask me how large is too large. I’m also not sure if they had a measuring stick in the Temple ☺.<br>Section four: Leviticus 21:20 uses the word “meroah ashekh” to refer to a disqualifying blemish and in this section the rabbis debate its meaning. This is similar to the debate at the end of 7:2.<br>According to the first three opinions, the “meroah ashekh” has a problem with his testicles, either he is missing them or they are crushed. Rabbi Akiva says that the problem is that he has “wind in his testicles” meaning they are distended. As in 7:2, Rabbi Hanina ben Antigonus offers up a completely different explanation. The word “ashekh” sounds like “hoshekh” which means “dark” or “black.” So the “meroah ashekh” is one whose complexion is black."

                    "<b>Introduction</b>\nOur mishnah deals with the laws concerning the human firstborn. There are two special rules with regard to the human first born: 1) he gets a double portion of his father’s inheritance (see Deuteronomy 21:17); 2) he must be redeemed from the priest for five shekels (see Numbers 18:16). Determining who is a firstborn is, however, different for these two matters. Our mishnah defines what firstborn counts as a firstborn for which of these two laws.",
                    "<b>There is one who is [counted as] a firstborn [with respect to] inheritance but not with respect to redemption from a priest; a firstborn with respect to redemption from a priest but not a firstborn [with respect] to inheritance; a firstborn [with respect to both] inheritance and redemption from a priest; and a firstborn [in respect] to neither inheritance nor redemption from a priest.</b>  This is an introduction to the remainder of the chapter. When it comes to who is considered a firstborn for the two relevant matters, all possibilities are open.",
                    "<b>Which is a firstborn [with respect] to inheritance but not to redemption from a priest? One which follows one which was not viable whose head came forth alive, or one born in the ninth month whose head came out dead, or when a woman aborts something that looks like an animal, beast or bird, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: [it is not considered an opening of the womb] until [the abortion] has the form of a human being.</b>  This section lists infants that count as being the firstborn for matters of inheritance but do not need to be redeemed from the priest. The first case seems to be that of twins. The first child is not viable, meaning that he is premature. This child’s head emerges from the womb and then it goes back into the womb, after which the other child is born. The child that is born counts as the first born for inheritance, but does not need to be redeemed. A firstborn male needs to be redeemed only if he “opened his mother’s womb” and since the other child opened his mother’s womb, the second child need not be redeemed. However, he does inherit because he is the first child actually born. There are some problems with this interpretation, namely that it is impossible for one of a set of twins to be premature whereas the other is ready to be born. Nevertheless, it seems possible, in my mind, that the rabbis believed that a pregnant woman could become pregnant again and therefore have “twins,” one of whom is more mature than the other. The second case is where a fully mature child (a nine months child) has his head emerge from the womb but is dead. Then his head goes back into the womb and the other twin is born. The live twin counts as the first born for inheritance but since he didn’t open the womb, he need not be redeemed. Finally, if a woman aborts a fetus that has the shape of an animal or bird, the first opinion counts this as “opening the womb” and therefore the next born male need not be redeemed. However, since the miscarriage did not have a human form, it does not count as the first born for matters of inheritance and the second child receives the double portion. This is Rabbi Meir’s opinion. The other sages hold that if the miscarriage does not have a human form it does not count as having opened the womb. The next child is a first-born for both matters.",

Therefore, the next born child receives the double inheritance but does not need to be redeemed. The first case is a “sandal.” This seems to be a flat piece of flesh that resembles a sandal. It seems to either accompany a fetus or once was a fetus. The second case is a placenta that inevitably accompanies a fetus, so it is a sign that there was at some point a fetus. The third case is a fetus that has a human shape, and the fourth case is where the aborted fetus is recognizably human but is cut up into pieces. In all of these cases the fetus counts as having opened the womb, but does not count as being the first born for matters of inheritance.",

This is his firstborn but not hers. In general, this means that the child gets the double inheritance from the father, but does not need to be redeemed because he did not open the mother’s womb. This is true even if the first child was conceived and born while the woman was not Jewish (or not free). Since her first free, Jewish child did not open the womb, he is not the first born for redemption. Rabbi Yose the Galilean holds that the child does not count as having opened his mother’s womb unless he is born while she is Jewish and free. He interprets “opens the womb in Israel” to mean that the child opens the womb of a woman who is alread “in Israel,” of Jewish status.",

If she does not wait, and she becomes pregnant immediately, the child does not inherit from either father, because the “certain” inheritors can claim that the child cannot prove who his father was. The child does need to be redeemed because he is a first-born to his mother. However, he will have to redeem himself when he gets older, because he has no “certain” father who is obligated to do so on his behalf.",

In all of these cases the woman has either a very early miscarriage or some sort of discharge that does not have the shape of a human fetus. These various types of discharges do not count as having opened her womb and therefore the child born afterwards is considered to be the first-born for both inheritance and redemption."

In contrast, slaves, while obviously moveable, are compared with land, and therefore firstborns cannot be redeemed with either slaves or land. If someone has a debt document in which his fellow owes him five shekels, he cannot use it to redeem his first born, because this debt document is not the same as actual money. It has no inherent value. The word “hekdesh” means property dedicated to the Temple and the word does not really belong here in this mishnah, because one cannot use Temple property to redeem a first born. It is probably here due to the similarity between this mishnah and Bava Metzia 4:9 and Shevuot 6:5.

If the father writes a note to the priest that he is liable to give him five shekels, the father has to give the priest five shekels, but this does not count as redeeming his son.

The animal that he calls ninth is the tenth and should have been the tithe. The animal that he calls tenth is not the tenth but rather the eleventh. In other words, one actually is the tenth and one is called the tenth. Therefore both animals have to go out to pasture and can be eaten only when they are blemished.",
                    "<b>If the ninth and the tenth came out at the same time, the ninth and the tenth are spoiled.</b>  If the ninth and tenth both come out at the same time then both are potentially the tenth and as in the previous section, both must go out to pasture until they become blemished at which point they may be eaten.",
                    "<b>If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the ninth and the eleventh the tenth, all three are holy: the ninth can be eaten when it becomes blemished, the tenth is the tithe and the eleventh is sacrificed as a shelamim, and it can make a substitute, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Judah said: can one substitute make another substitute? They said in the name of Rabbi Meir: if it were a substitute, it would not have been sacrificed.</b>  Here he really messed up the counting. The ninth, which he called the tenth, can be eaten when it becomes blemished. The tenth is the actual tithe, even though he called it the eleventh. The eleventh, which he also called tenth, has to be offered up as a shelamim offering. There is now a debate whether or not it is possible for the eleventh animal that is offered as a shelamim to make another animal into its substitute. Making a substitute means that if one tries to substitute the holy animal for another animal, the substituted animal becomes holy, even though the original one remains holy. Rabbi Meir says that this eleventh animal can make a substitute. Rabbi Judah questions this because in his opinion this animal is itself a substitute for the tenth animal, the real tithe. Since we hold that a substitute animal cannot make another substitute (and if one tries to do so, the substitution has no validity) this shelamim cannot effect a substitute. Rabbi Meir responds that the eleventh animal offered as a shelamim is not a “substitute” for if it was it couldn’t be sacrificed as a shelamim. Rabbi Meir holds that if an animal is substituted for a tithed animal, the substituted animal cannot be sacrificed. Since this is not a substitute but rather a regular shelamim, it can make another animal into a substitute.",
                    "<b>If he called the ninth the tenth, the tenth the tenth and the eleventh the tenth, the eleventh is not holy. The following is the rule: wherever the name of the tenth [animal] has not been taken away from it, the eleventh is not consecrated.</b>  If he makes a mistake, but does call the tenth the tenth, then the eleventh is not holy. The general rule explains if the tenth receives its proper appellation, then anything that follows it is not holy. However, the ninth, which he accidentally called the tenth is still holy and must go out to pasture until it is blemished at which point it can be eaten. Congratulations!  We have finished Tractate Bekhorot! It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us finish learning the tractate and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning it, so that we may not forget it and so that its lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. Although Bekhorot was mostly full of technical information, we should not lose sight of the religious idea that stands behind the idea of the holiness of the bekhor. As is well-known, the final plague on Egypt was the slaying of the first-born. The loss of every first-born, animal and human, was so great in the eyes of the Egyptians that they finally allowed the children of Israel to leave Egypt. I have often wondered why this plague caused them to finally let the people go? Surely many, perhaps even more, people died in the other horrible plagues. What was it about this plague that made it so much worse than the others? Regardless of how we answer that question, after that event, the first-borns of Israel owed God their lives and in order to express this debt, they had to be redeemed. As a first-born male, I was redeemed when I reached thirty days, and since my first child is a male, I redeemed him when he reached thirty days. While I don’t remember the first event, I remember the redemption of my own son as being a meaningful event in his life, as well as mine and my wife’s. Again, congrats on making it through Bekhorot. Tomorrow we begin Tractate Erkhin."
