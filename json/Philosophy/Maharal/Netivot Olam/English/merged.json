                "The Gemara in Masechet Megilla says: R. Eleazar said: What is the meaning of the verse, Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord, or make all his praise to be heard? (Psalms 106) For whom is it fitting to express the mighty acts of the Lord? For one who can make all his praise to be heard. Rabbah b. Bar Hanah said in the name of R. Johanan: One who descants upon the praises of the Holy One, blessed be He, to excess is uprooted from the world, as it says, Shall it be told to him that I should speak? Should a man [try to] say, surely he would be swallowed up. (Job 37:20) R. Judah a man of Kefar Gibboraya, or, as some say, of Kefar Gibbor Hayil, gave the following homily: What is meant by the verse, For thee silence is praise? (Psalms 65) The best medicine of all is silence. When R. Dimi came, he said: In the West they say: A word is worth a Sela’, silence two Sela's. (Megillah 18a, Soncino translation).",

                "In the Book of Proverbs (14:29) [it says]: \"He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.\" King Solomon wanted to say that a person who does not anger easily is of great understanding, and this is as Solomon says in Ecclesiastes (7:9): \"For anger resteth in the bosom of fools.\" And this is because when anger easily excites someone, all of this excitement is material in nature, and therefore he [Solomon] says 'For anger resteth in the bosom of fools' and the fool is far from one who is enlightened by higher elements, but one who is a possessor of slowness to anger [lit. of long breath] is slow to anger, and this teaches that he is of great understanding – because he is enlightened by his higher elements, therefore he is slow to anger. And he [Solomon] says “But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly” – this means when someone is of hasty spirit, this means folly is exalted out of them as one sifts out gold, because even if he is intelligent, in any case when he is quick to anger this exalts his folly. And in another place (Proverbs, 16:32), he [Solomon] says: “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city”, read: one who is slow to anger is mighty because he stands like a hero and is not easily excited, and one who rules and conquers his spirit so that it will not leave him is greater than one who taketh a city, for one who conquers a city is conquering something material in nature, but one that conquers his spirit – this is something that is not material in nature, therefore he is greater. And this quality, slowness to anger [lit. of long breath], is from the qualities of God, may He be blessed, which is called ‘slowness to anger’ [lit. of long breath]....", 
                "In the first chapter of Masechet Eiruvin (13b): for what reason did the Beit Hillel merit to establish the Halakha according to them? Because they were calm when they were insulted and they would teach both their teachings and the teachings of the Beit Shamai. Furthermore, they would place the teachings of Beit Shamai before their own, as we learn in our Mishnah (Sukkah 28b): “one whose head and most of him were in the Sukkah, and his table is in the house – Beit Shamai validate and Beit Hillel validate. Beit Hillel said to Beit Shamai: was there not such an incident that the elders of Beit Shamai and the elders of Beit Hillel went to visit Rabbi Yochanan ben Hachorani etc.” From this understand and know that this quality is one who is centered, for one who is centered does not stray from the straight path at all, and he maintains his equilibrium, the opposite of someone who is not centered and because of this strays from equilibrium. And because of this, Beit Hillel merited that the Halakha is established according to them, because they were masters of calmness and they were not like Beit Shamai who acted with strictness, and it is known that strictness because of great anger leads to straying from equilibrium completely, and Halakha is the path which does not stray to the right or left at all – only walking with equilibrium and not swerving to the left or the right, and therefore what we call ‘Halakha’ is called ‘Halakha,’ because one who walks walks in straightness and does not tend from the straight and equal path at all, not to the right and not to the left; and this is the quality of Beit Hillel, that they had this quality in all of their conduct – they wouldn’t stray from equilibrium because they were centered. And don’t say that Beit Shamai weren’t wise, for on the contrary they were very wise and intellectually sharp. Only in the area of Halakha which is the path of the straight it is according to Beit Hillel because they were masters of calmness without veering from the order. And so they were [calm] even when they were insulted, and they taught their words and the words of their friends, and all of this refers to being completely calm, for in the case of other people, when someone says something to him, he is quick to become angry and to insult him back, while in the case of Beit Hillel they had the quality of being calm and did not insult even someone who insulted them. And so too when they taught their teachings and the teachings of Beit Shamai. Furthermore, they would put Beit Shamai’s teachings before their own. In all of these matters they were organized in their actions, and they were not from the group of highly competitive against their friends, and they were from the group that succeeds. And even though Halakhic discussions are nevertheless good, they [Beit Shamai] are not organized, and for matters of Halakha it is required that they not be not organized and are completely balanced. And all of these words that are mentioned [about Beit Hillel], they were well-organized and did not become disorganized. Even though the Halakha is not according to Beit Shamai, nevertheless the words of Beit Shamai are also the words of the Living God, as it is there. And this idea that they were stringent is because the attribute of Beit Shamai is also the attribute of wisdom, as it says: “if you see a Talmud Chacham, he takes vengeance and guards his hatred like a snake, gird him upon your hips”, and this idea we explained in its place, but with regards to Halakha it is fitting to be according to Beit Hillel for Beit Hillel were organized in their actions and did not stray from equilibrium, and therefore it was appropriate for Halakha.", 
                "And in the fourth chapter of tractate Pesachim (113b): The Holy One May He Be Blessed Loves three: one who does not become angry; one who does not stand on his attributes and one who is not drunk. This statement is hinting at profound wisdom, for one who has these three is fitting for the love; for in these three attributes one is similar to the Creator of All, and one who is similar is loved by one who is similar. And know that HaShem May He Be Blessed is not affected in the way that material items are affected, or in that way that something that is a physical force is also affected. And so HaShem May He Be Blessed does not have definitions [lit. a fence], for a definition is composed of a fence that is separate, and any thing that is composed [of something] has the quality of being material, and thus all of them are attributes of the material. And therefore [the Gemara] said one who does not anger behold he is not affected like the physical, and as was explained above when one is slow to anger, he possesses an intellect which is completely separate, and thus one who does not anger is separate from the physical and in this way is similar to HaShem May He Be Blessed who does not have a physical force. And one who is drunk is completely physical for when he becomes drunk he has removed his intellect and he is physical, and we already explained this in many places and in the Path of Prayer we explained this, for the drunk is completely physical and thus the Torah forbids one who drank wine from entering a place of holiness which is separate, and he may not teach Torah which is intellectual. And one who does not stand on his attributes, behold for this person there is no definition, for one who has definition does not ever stray from his definition, and thus does not stray from his attributes and only stands within his definition, but one who does not stand on his attributes does not have a definition and he actually is not physical and in that sense is similar to HaShem May He Be Blessed who does not have a definition, and thus HaShem May He Be Blessed loves one who does not have any of these three things because the similar loves the one who is similar to him, and when one has these three things, there is a similarity in that He May He Be Blessed is separate from the physical and this is an essence of His Self, May He May Be Blessed. And all of these three each one is further from the physical: for the drunk is completely physical; and when one does not anger he is not affected and is not like something which has a physical force in that that a physical force affects it in a physical manner; and one who stands on his attributes has a physical element in that he has definition and the definition is a border which is connected to physical; and these words are words of extreme wisdom. And it should be made clear to you that one who has the quality of being calm does not have the quality of being angry, and follows after HaShem May He Be Blessed, and thus HaShem May He Be Blessed loves him.

                "And in Perek Chelek (Sanhedrin 92a): Rabbi Elazar said: every community leader who leads the congregation calmly merits to lead them in the world to come, as it says: “For He that hath compassion on them will lead them, Even by the springs of water will He guide them” (Isaiah 49:10). And the explanation of this is that, more than any other, (the trait of) calmness is suitable for a community leader who leads the community, for every community leader that leads the nation with calmness – there will be tranquility for the nation according to how he leads and he will lead the community with calmness, and know that in this world the world is not tranquil, and when he leads the community and leads them in this world in a way that echoes the world to come, ‘for on tranquil waters he leads them,’ he merits to lead them in the world to come as well, for the world to come is completely tranquil, for now in this world it is impossible to be completely tranquil, and thus he merits to lead them in the future, for so it will be a completely tranquil world of quiet and security, and the leadership will be of calmness from every side."

                "And in the chapter of ‘These are the Words’ (Pesachim 66b): Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: any person that becomes angry: if he is a wise man, his wisdom departs from him; if he is a prophet, his prophecy departs from him. If he is a wise man his wisdom departs from him – as it is written (Numbers 31:14), “And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host”, and it says (Numbers 31:21) “And Eleazar the priest said…”, implying that it (the wisdom/laws) became hidden from Moses. If he is a prophet his prophecy departs from him – from Elisha, as it is written (II Kings 3:14): “…surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshapat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee,” and it is written (II Kings 3:15): “But now bring me a minstrel.’ And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the spirit [hand] of the LORD came upon him.” Rabbi Mani the son of Patish said: any person who becomes angry, even if he is destined for greatness from the heavens is lowered. From where do we know this? From where do we know this? From Eliab, as it is written (I Samuel 17:28) “and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David and he said..,”, and when Shmuel went to anoint him with reference to all of [David’s brothers] it is written, (I Samuel 16:8) \"", 
                "And in the chapter “The Morning Prayer” (Berakhot 29b): “Rabbi Eliyahu said to Rabbi Yehuda the brother of Rav Selah Chisda: ‘Don’t get angry and don’t sin; don’t get drunk and don’t sin; and when you go out to the path [to start your journey], consult with your Owner and go out, etc.” Rabbi Yaakov said Rav Chisda said: ‘this is Tefilat HaDerech [the Prayer for the Journey].’” This statement is surprising, for what is the connection between each of these? But this statement comes to inform that one should not remove his cleaving to the Name May He Be Blessed, he should only cleave to him, and regarding this it says don’t get angry and don’t sin. Behold the Name May He Be Blessed created man from body and soul, and the body is the material and the soul is the spiritual and they are opposites, and when man stands as is fitting, without leaning to one side, so the man stands in his equilibrium and cleaves to May He Be Blessed. And this idea is hinted at in [the Hebrew words for] ‘man’ and ‘woman’, because the body is like a woman and the soul is like a man, and the name Yud”Hey is between them when they are together as is fitting. And when the soul, with its strength, deviates from that which is fitting by way of anger; or when the drunkenness of man leads him to the material side to the extreme until he is all material, as was explained above, and when he leans to the material he leaves the center point and removes the cleaving [to G-d]. And because of this it says about these two ‘and don’t sin’, because immediately when a man goes to the extreme [lit. leans to the edge of edges] he leans towards sin, and thus it says, “don’t get angry and don’t sin; don’t get drunk and don’t sin.” And after this it says for there is a side that does not lean to the edge, it is a side of separation and removal from the cleaving: for when it is fitting for him to request the cleaving from May He Be Blessed, and he does not request the cleaving, behold he separates from Him, and this is in the hour where he goes out and the man needs the cleaving - it is the accompaniment - and when he doesn’t request the cleaving behold he separates from the cleaving, for the accompaniment is so that he will have a connection with May He Be Blessed, and He will cleave to the man, and therefore it is called ‘accompaniment’ from the language of “For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head” (Proverbs 1:9), and by way of these three things man does not remove or lean from the Name May He Be Blessed. And we already explained this in the Path of Prayer....", 
                "In the fourth chapter of tractate Nedarim (Nedarim 22a): “Rabbi Shmuel the Son of Nachami said: Rabbi Yochanan said: Anyone who is angry – every type of punishment of Gehinom shall rule over him, as it is written: “Therefore remove vexation from thy heart, And put away evil from thy flesh; For childhood and youth are vanity” (Ecclesiastes 11:10), and ‘evil’ is only Gehinom, as it is written: “The LORD hath made every things for His own purpose, Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil” (Proverbs 16:4).” And the meaning of this is that one who is on fire with rage is essentially Gehinom, because the power and greatness of the strength of Gehinom is connected to the power of fire, and thus it is said in every place [in rabbinic literature] ‘the fire of Gehinom’. And because man has a spiritual soul, when he becomes angry and departs from the order, every type of Gehinom rules over him, because the Gehinom also is a departure from the order of the world; thus every type of Gehinom rules over he who is angry, and thus it is written, ‘And put evil away from thy flesh’. And because his soul that is angry is spiritual, and he departs from the Name May He Be Blessed by way of the anger, thus the Gehinom which is also spiritual and departs from the balance rules over him. [Nedarim 22b continues…] “Rava Bar Rav Huna said anyone who is angry – even the Shechina is not important to him, as it is written (Psalms 10:4), “The wicked, in the pride of his countenance [, saith]: 'He will not require'; All his thoughts are: 'There is no God.'” Rabbi Jeremiah from Difty said: he also forgets his Torah learning and adds stupidity, as it says (Ecclesiastes 7:9), “For anger resteth in the bosom of fools,” and it is written (Proverbs 13:16), “But a fool unfoldeth folly.” Rav Nachman said it is known that [as a result of getting angry] your sins will be greater than your merits, as it says (Proverbs 29:22), “And a wrathful man aboundeth in transgression.” ” And that which is written that the Shechina is not important to him – this is as I will explain, for when a person is angry, he departs from the appropriate order and therefore leaves the order until the Shechina is no longer important to him on a large change, because the person is aligned with the Name May He Be Blessed, who is his Cause, and when he is angry he departs from the order, and thus it says also the Shechina is not important to him because he does not recognize his Cause, may He be blessed, when he departs from the order. And it is said also that he forgets his Torah learning, as it was explained above, because his wisdom is the organization of his intellect, from the angle that he departs from the order and therefore his intellect leaves him. And thus that which is written that he is a sinner is also this idea, for every sinner departs from the fitting path, which the Name May He Be Blessed set for him, and because of this he is a sinner, and this idea is obvious. And these three ideas mentioned here - that the Shechina is not important to him, and that he forgets his Torah learning, and that he becomes a sinner – each one adds to the other: when the Shechina is not important to him, this is the primary root [lit. first] – when therefore he departs from the order until the Shechina is no longer important to him; and more, when his wisdom is removed from him when he does this there is an impression on himself until his wisdom departs from him; and it adds even more that he becomes a sinner himself. And this is also because the anger is a completely foreign departure from the fitting order until he will find these three ideas, which are foreign, and by way of these three he will depart from the order in everything when he understands these three ideas. ...", 
                "In the first chapter of masechet Gittin (Gittin 6b; Gittin 7a): “Rav Chisda said: a man should never impose too much awe in his home, for behold the concubine in Gibeah (Judges 19) – her husband imposed too much awe, and cause tens of thousands to fall from Israel. Rabbi Yehuda said that Rav said: anyone who imposes excessive awe within his home – in the end he will come to the hands of the three transgressions: immoral sexual acts, spilling of blood [i.e. murder], and desecration of the Sabbath. Rava Bar Rav Chana said this is what the rabbis say: a man is required to say three things in his home on the eve of the Sabbath as it gets darker: Did you tithe? Did you prepare the eruvs? Did you light the candle? He is required to say them calmly in order that they will accept from him. Rav Ashi said I did not hear this statement from Rava Bar Rav Chana, but I understood it through logic.” Behold the great punishment for one who imposes too much awe according to the great size of the thing that he did, which is too much awe, and he causes an alteration of every aspect of man. And these are the things: they are immoral sexual acts, spilling of blood [i.e. murder], and desecration of the Name, and this is the version of R”H. This is a change in every person, and this thing is a tremendous matter of wisdom how violating these three distorts a person completely: because immoral sexual acts are specifically connected to the body, and just as it says in the Writings (Leviticus 18:6), “None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness…”,  one who uncovers nakedness changes his body; and the spilling of blood changes the soul because one who murders sins with his soul and therefore it is called ‘spilling of blood’ because the blood is specifically the soul that is not inside the body; and the idol worship changes the intellect when the brain errs after idol worship; and so desecration of the Name will be explained in the Path of the Good Name, that this sin is a sin of the intellect. And these three things encompass all three parts of a person: body, soul and intellect, which are the three parts of the person, and therefore one who imposes too much fear within his home in which the fear acts on the person and since the fear overcomes the person it changes the person in these three parts of the person, and regenerate from this immoral sexual acts, spilling of blood and the desecration of the Name which are the three parts of the person and it is all from the force of too much fear. And it is important to understand the matter of too much fear that generates these three things when it is known to those with understanding and there is no need to continue longer here.", 
                "In the first chapter of Rosh HaShana (Rosh Hashanah 17a): “the minin and the apikorsim who deny the Torah and deny resuscitation of the dead, and separate themselves form the ways of the community, and they placed fear on the land of the living [i.e. they imposed fear on others], etc. ‘They placed fear on the land of the living’ - this is a parnes [secular community leader] who imposes too much awe on the community not in the name of heaven, as Rav Yehuda said that Rav said, any parnes who imposes too much awe on the community not in the name of heaven will not see a son who is a Torah scholar, as it says (Job 37:24), “Men do therefore fear Him; He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.”” And behold, the parnes who imposes too much awe on the community, he is like all of the minim and those who separate themselves from the way of the community, for also the parnes who imposes too much awe on the community, he separates himself from the community and is not included in the community. Of course, when he does it in the name of the heavens and for the sake of the community, this is not referred to as separating from the community, but when it is not for the sake of the heavens, then behold he separates from the community. And I already explained the matter of separating from the way of the community, which is separating from the Name May He Be Blessed, because He May He Be Blessed is called the God of Israel, and therefore it is fitting that one who separates from the community will be considered like one who separates from the Name May He Be Blessed, and this matter is clear. And that which is said that he will not see a son who is a Torah scholar, it’s meaning is (Kohelet 9:17) “The words of the wise spoken in calmness are heard,” and this we explained above, for every matter of the seichel [intellect] is calm, and organized, and the seichel does not leave the order like the other forces that are in man that act with their power, for it is not a matter of seichel unless it is organized. And therefore it is said that one who imposes too much awe on the congregation not in the name of heaven will not see a son who is a Torah scholar, because the seichel is also the parnes and the leader of all the limbs of the man, and it leads with calmness, and thus it is fitting that the man who leads the community without having to be admired by those beneath him, it is like the intellect of man that leads the city as they are all the limbs of the man, for man is called a city, as it says (Kohelet 9:14) “there was a little city, and few men within it,” etc., as was explained above. And just like it is thus with a person, so too it is fitting when leading a community, and if one does not lead the community thus, and only rules the community by force and imposes too much fear on the community, a son who is a Torah scholar will never derive from him, for how can a son who is a Torah scholar derive from him, since his leadership is not similar to the power of the intellect which is a parnes who also leads the community with order and calmness, and this matter should be understood.
