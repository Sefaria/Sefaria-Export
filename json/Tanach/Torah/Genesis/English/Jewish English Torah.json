            "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.", 
            "Now the earth was formless and empty, with darkness over the surface of the deep, and God's wind was hovering over the surface of the waters.", 
            "God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light.", 
            "God saw that the light was good, and God divided the light from the darkness.", 
            "God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. There was evening and there was morning, a first day.", 
            "God said, \"Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide water from water.\"", 
            "God made the expanse, and divided the water which was under the expanse from the water which was above the expanse; and it was so.", 
            "God called the expanse Heaven. There was evening and there was morning, a second day.", 
            "God said, \"Let the waters under the sky be gathered to one place, and let the dry land appear\"; and it was so.", 
            "God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering of the waters He called Seas, and God saw that it was good.", 
            "God said, \"Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed in it, on the earth\"; and it was so.", 
            "The earth yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good.", 
            "There was evening and there was morning, a third day.", 
            "God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of Heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be signs for the seasons, and for days and years.", 
            "And let them be for lights in the expanse of Heaven to give light upon the earth\"; and it was so.", 
            "God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the stars.", 
            "God set them in the expanse of Heaven to give light to the earth,", 
            "and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness, and God saw that it was good.", 
            "There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.", 
            "God said, \"Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the expanse of Heaven.\"", 
            "God created the large sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it was good.", 
            "God blessed them, saying, \"Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.\"", 
            "There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.", 
            "God said, \"Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind\"; and it was so.", 
            "God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind, and God saw that it was good.", 
            "God said, \"Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.\"", 
            "God created the man in His image, in God's image He created him, male and female He created them.", 
            "God blessed them, and God said to them, \"Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.\"", 
            "God said, \"Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed on the surface of all the earth, and every tree bearing fruit yielding seed. It will be yours for food.", 
            "To every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is the breath of life, I have given every green herb for food\"; and it was so.", 
            "God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
