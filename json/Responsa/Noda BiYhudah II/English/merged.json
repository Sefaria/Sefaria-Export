                "<b>Response</b>",
                "Greetings to the scholar, who engages with the laws of Mt. Horeb, the esteemed rabbi, my honored friend, the Torah chieftain, our master, Rabbi Gumprecht Oppenheim, may our Rock protect him.",
                "I received your letter, and although I do not recognize you and do not know you, nevertheless, when one comes to ask a question and speaks using the language of the sages, I respond to every questioner.",
                "The root of the question is this: A certain man, who God has graced with a large estate, has villages and forests – forests in which all the beasts of the forest prowl. May he go himself to shoot with a rifle (lit. “fire stick”) to trap game, or is it forbidden for one of Israel to do this deed, whether because it causes pain to creatures (“<i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>”), because it violates “you shall not destroy” (“<i>bal tashhit</i>”), or because it is customary to regard it as <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>? It is explained in Tosafot on Tractate Avoda Zara, that is, in Piskei Hatosafot, and in Issur Ve-hetter 59:36, which states in the name of Rosh (R. Asher b. Jehiel) that anything medicinal does not constitute a gentile custom (“darkei ha-Emori”) and in the name Tosafot in Avoda Zara that although <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> is a Torah prohibition, if it is helpful in some way, it is permitted.",
                "[Answer:] In truth, Tosafot on Avoda Zara 11a, s.v. “okrin,” indicates to the contrary. This is the formulation of Tosafot: If you ask: Why doesn’t [the Talmud] ask: ‘But there is <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>!?’ Granted, there is no <i>bal tashhit</i> because one can do this to honor the king, so it is not wasteful. It is akin to burial shrouds worth a hundred coins. But how can <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> be permitted? One can answer that the king’s honor is different, for it is the honor of all Israel, and public honor supersedes <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>.",
                "It thus seems from their words that <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> is more severe than <i>bal tashhit</i> and is not permitted even in a case of need except for the sake of public honor. Go and see that Tosafot refer to this as “superseding” (“dehiya”), that public honor supersedes <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>. So how can one say that it would be permitted for the needs of a voluntary matter?",
                "However, Piskei Tosafot ad loc. states: “<i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> is not forbidden except when pain is inflicted without profit.”",
                "In truth, the words of Tosafot themselves here in Avoda Zara, where their words show that the prohibition of <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> is more severe than the prohibition of <i>bal tashhit</i>, contradicts the words of Tosafot in Bava Metzia 32b, s.v. “Mi-divrei shneihem,” which states: “If you ask: If so, why do we mutilate [animals] for kings…? One may answer: The honor of the king or prince is greater, like <i>bal tashhit</i> which is superseded in their honor…” Thus, the prohibition of <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> is compared to <i>bal tashhit</i>.",
                "However, the words of Tosafot in Bava Metzia are against the words of Maimonides, for there in Bava Metzia, Tosafot upheld the opinion of the sage who maintains that <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> is a biblical prohibition, whereas <i>bal tashhit</i> is of rabbinic origin except the case of cutting down trees. And this is the formulation of Maimonides in the Laws of Kings 6:8: <i>We do not cut down food trees…. Anyone who cuts one down is given lashes. This is not only during a siege, rather any time one cuts down a food tree in a destructive manner, he is given lashes.</i> And 6:10: <i>It is not only trees; rather, one who shatters vessels, rips clothing, demolishes a building, stops up a well, or ruin food in a destructive manner violates bal tashhit, but does not incur lashes, merely rabbinically-ordained beatings for rebelliousness.</i> Thus, other forms of destruction, which do not involve cutting down trees, are only rabbinic violations of <i>bal tashhit</i>. ",
                "Indeed, there is no need for us to write at length about this, because R. Israel Isserlein has already written at length, in his Pesakim U-khetavim (Terumat Ha-deshen Vol II) §105, that anything that is for man’s needs does not constitute <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>, and moreover, <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> is only applicable when one causes it pain but leaves it alive. However, to kill livestock, beasts, and all sorts of animals does not constitute <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>. This can also be shown from Hullin 7b: “Shall I mutilate it? It constitutes <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>. Kill it? It constitutes <i>bal tashhit</i>.” Thus, even though the response to his proposal to mutilate is that it would constitute <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i>, he nevertheless asks if he may kill it. ",
                "Thus, there is no <i>tza’ar ba’alei hayim</i> in the subject of this question. And there is no <i>bal tashhit</i> because one benefits from the pelt, and further, is not acting in a destructive manner.",
                "Furthermore, the main prohibition of <i>bal tashhit</i>, though rabbinic, is nevertheless rooted in the Torah’s prohibition of cutting down fruit trees. And there it is written: “For you shall eat it and not cut it down…” (Devarim 20:19). Thus, since whatever the rabbis instituted was modeled on Torah law, one may not destroy something that man can benefit from; one may not destroy and debase that benefit. Perhaps this even applies to something ownerless. However, <i>bal tashhit</i> does not apply to something whose loss that will not cause the loss of benefit to any man. Therefore, those animals of the forest, while they are alive, give benefit to no man. Their main benefit is in their death—through their pelts and meat. So how can we say that it is forbidden to kill them because of <i>bal tashhit</i>?",
                "And to suggest that it is forbidden as a permissible action that others have customarily treated as prohibited—here, too, there is not concern, for one cannot say that there is a custom to prohibit something that is uncommon.",
                "Thus far, we have addressed the legal aspects.",
                "However, I am surprised by the matter itself. We find no hunters other than Nimrod and Esau, and this is not the way of the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Go and look, regarding the congratulation “let it be worn out and renewed” – R. Jacob Weil writes in his rulings, cited by Rema in Orah Hayim at the end of §223, that one does not say this on something made of animal skins, because “His mercy extends over all His creations” (Psalms 145:9). And even though Rema writes on this that it is weak reasoning, because it is not necessary for an animal to be killed on his behalf, as there are many pelts and skins that are already prepared, and many of them die of natural causes but can still be used for their pelts. Nevertheless, Rema concludes that many are careful about this. For how can a man of Israel actively kill beasts needlessly, simply to pass his leisure time by engaging in hunting?",
                "If you suggest [that one may hunt] because bears, wolves, and other predators are likely to cause damage, for [the Rabbis] have stated that “a wolf, a lion… whoever displays alacrity in killing them has merited” (Sanhedrin 15a) – this is mistaken as well, for two reasons: First, the law does not accord with Rabbi Eliezer with regard to a wolf, lion, bear, leopard, or panther, and even with regard to a snake, Maimonides and Raavad disagree in the Laws of Sanhedrin 5:2.",
                "Secondly, even according to Rabbi Eliezer, we maintain the view of Resh Lakish, namely, that only when [the beasts] have already killed [is it permitted to kill them], as made clear by Maimonides loc. cit.—and see Kesef Mishneh ad loc.—yet a party to the debate may still find grounds to say that this applies when they have an owner and are tame, as detailed in Sanhedrin 15b, which concludes regarding the statement of R. Shimon b. Lakish [=Resh Lakish], “We see that he maintains that they are tame and have owners.” This is also the formulation of Maimonides loc. cit.: “A lion, bear, or panther that are tame and have owners…” Thus, those which were not domesticated are not tame and are usually destructive, and so even on Shabbat it is nevertheless permitted to trample them innocuously, as detailed in Shabbat 121b and Shulhan Arukh [Orah Hayim] 316:10.",
                "Yet even this is unrelated to the present care, for in that case, when they came into a settled area, a place of human beings, and they are nearby, then during the week one may kill them, and on Shabbat one may trample them innocuously. Indeed, it is stated in Shabbat loc. cit.: “Our Rabbis taught: “If snakes came upon him—if he killed them, then it is known that they came upon him so that he can kill them….” But to chase after them in the forests, the location of their dens, when it is not usual for them to enter settled areas, there is no mitzva, and there is nothing but the pursuit of his heart’s appetites and the counsel of [the evil inclination, which] is compared to a deer.",
                "A man who needs to do so, whose livelihood is from such trapping, is not cruel. After all, we slaughter livestock, beasts, and birds and kill fish for human consumption, and why should there be a difference between kosher animals whose meat is eaten and unkosher animals through which one earns a living and eats by the sale of their pelts? All creatures were given to man for all his needs. However, for one who does not need this for his livelihood, and whose main intent is not at all for the sake of earning a living, this is cruelty.",
                "Thus far I have addressed the aspect of proper behavior, [contending] that man ought to distance himself from this. Now I say that it is even forbidden, for anyone who engages in this must enter the forests and place themselves in great danger, in places of packs of wild animals. And the Merciful One said: “Take great care of yourselves” (Deut. 4:15). And who was a greater and more expert hunter than Esau, about who Scripture attests: “Esau was a skillful hunter…” (Genesis 25:27). Yet look at what he said about himself: “I am about to die…” (ibid. 32). And no Scripture departs from its plain meaning, which is that he endangers himself each day among packs of wild beasts. So explains Nachmanides. So then how can a Jewish man insert himself into a place of packs of wild and vicious beasts? Yet even here, if one who poor and does so for sustenance, the Torah permitted it, like any maritime trader crosses the sea—for with regard to anything that is for the needs of one’s sustenance and livelihood, there is no choice. The Torah has said [about the wages of a day laborer]: “His life depends on it” (Deuteronomy 24:15). And the sages said (Bava Metzia 112a): “Why did this person ascend a ramp, dangle from a tree, and place himself at risk of death? Is it not for his wages?” But one whose main intention is not for sustenance, rather, he does to the place of packs of wild animals due to his heart’s appetite, and endangers himself, violates “Take great care of yourselves.”",
                "This is the formulation of Maimonides in Laws of Murderers and Preservation of Life 12:6: <i>It is also forbidden for one to pass under a collapsing wall… and so too anything akin to this and other dangers—it is forbidden to pass through their place.</i>",
                "Based on this, I now say that this entails a prohibition, as well as endangerment, and a third thing—that it causes his sins to be invoked—for this is no worse than [passing under] a collapsing wall [which, according to the Talmud, causes ones sins to be invoked before God]. Perhaps this is the intent of the Sages of the Mishna in m. Berakhot 4:4: “Rabbi Joshua says: One who passes through a dangerous place recites a short prayer and says: ‘Save, O Lord, Your people…in every time of crisis’ (‘ibur’).” And the Talmud (Berakhot 29b) asks: “What does ‘time of crisis’ mean? R. Hisda said in the name of Mar Ukva: ‘Even when You are filled with anger (evra) against them’… Some say… ‘Even when they transgress (ovrin) the words of the Torah.” ",
                "According to our approach, we can understand this. One who walks in a dangerous place transgresses the words of the Torah, which states, “Take great care of yourselves.” It also causes his sins to be invoked, and consequently the Almighty is filled with anger at him—whereas any other transgression that one may do will not cause the Almighty to be filled with anger against him. But one who causes the invocation of all his transgressions is subject to the Almighty’s anger. Therefore, our Sages instructed one who must do so for his livelihood to recite this prayer for himself. But how can the prayers of one who does so in such an abhorrent manner be accepted? Thus, this activity includes a repugnant character trait, that is, cruelty, as well as a prohibition, endangerment, and the invocation of one’s sins.",
                "One who heeds me will therefore dwell safely, tranquilly, and contentedly at home and not waste his time with such things.",
                "If not for my love of the gentleman who is so renowned for his good character, I would not engage in the response to this question. But since I know that the gentleman and his entire family have an excellent reputation, I therefore must use all my power to protect his family, lest they give grounds for those who hate the gentleman—a hate derived from envy—to find something about which to complain.",
                "This will bring peace.",
                "\"Ever preoccupied, but yours.\" "

                "To my friend, my relative-by-marriage, my confidant, my beloved, the wonderful rabbi, outstanding in Torah, the esteemed teacher and rabbi Leib Fischels,  may the Merciful One protect and redeem him.",
                "Regarding your treatise, which you sent to me, and which offers a presentation of the issue that you were asked about by the holy community of London: It happened that someone was ill with a gallstone. The physicians performed surgery, as usual for such an affliction, but it did not cure him, and he died. The sages of that city were asked if it is permissible to dissect the cadaver in that place to see evidence of the root of the affliction, and to learn from it for the future practice of medicine, so that if such a case occurs again, they know how to perform the surgery necessary for a cure without incising him too much, thus minimizing the risks of the surgery. Is this prohibited because it constitutes desecration and disgrace of this corpse, or is it permitted because it leads to the future saving of lives, so that they may take the utmost caution in their craft.",
                "The one who permitted wanted to derive precedent from embalming, for we find the embalming of Jacob, Joseph, and Israelite kings in the Torah. And even though this is for their honor, it is also the honor of the deceased for rescue and salvation to come to the world through him. He also brought evidence from the responsum of Rashba cited by Rema on Yoreh De’ah 363:2, regarding Reuben who instructed his sons to bring him to his ancestral burial place: “It is permitted to place lye on the skin to accelerate decomposition… due to the needs of the hour, Rashba permitted disinterring from the original grave and placing lye on one who instructed that he be brought to his ancestral grave. Certainly [this would be permitted] in the present case, which is before burial.” This is the rationale of the one who permits.",
                "And this is the statement of the one who prohibits: It is stated in Bava Batra 155a, regarding the incident in Bnei Brak, that R. Akiva said: “You have no permission to desecrate it.” The permitting sage responded that the case there is different: they wanted to desecrate it for money [to see if the deceased was a minor, whose transactions are invalid], so R. Akiva told them that they have no permission to desecrate it. That is not the case here, where it is needed to save lives. All of the above is the debate that took place in London.",
                "Your Excellency rejected the evidence stated by both, and all of your Excellency’s words are Torah, fitting of the one who stated them. Certainly embalming is not disgraceful at all. On the contrary, it is for [the deceased’s] honor. Placing lye on the deceased is also not desecration or disgrace. The lengthy exchange about this was unnecessary, and your Excellency has already explained this sufficiently. Regarding the words of the one who prohibited—certainly if we would say that this is a matter of saving lives, the one who permits obviously rebutted well, namely, that R. Akiva’s prohibition for monetary needs does not serve as precedent for the need to save lives. Your Excellency responded to the words of the one who prohibited: “In fact, his prooftext for prohibiting demonstrates, to the contrary, that it is permissible. For there (Bava Batra 144b) the Talmud states: ‘For the sake of the buyers, let it indeed be desecrated.’ It is thus clear that due to the buyers’ losses, we do not pay attention to desecration of the deceased.”",
                "In truth, your Excellency responded well to the prohibiting sage. However, since I do not know who the one who prohibits is, and perhaps he is a Torah scholar, it is my tendency to seek merit. Perhaps his intention is that it is nevertheless clear from this [passage in the Talmud] that the heirs, the family of the deceased, may not desecrate [the corpse] even if it would cause them losses, since they are relatives. This is explicit in Tosafot ad loc. s.v. “zuzei yahavinan” and in Rema’s glosses to [Shulhan Arukh] Hoshen Mishpat 107:2: if the litigant is a relative of the deceased, we protest against him so that he does not delay the burial of the dead for the sake of having a debt repaid. Presumably, in the present case as well, one may not do anything to the deceased without the consent of his relatives, and the prohibiting sage stated that the heirs have no right to consent to his desecration.",
                "Your Excellency also cited a prooftext from Hullin 11b: “if you say: let us desecrate this [victim] to save the life of that [murderer]”—that is, it should be permissible to desecrate the murder victim in order to save the murderer [from punishment, if the victim was found to be terminally ill  in any case]. And if you say that in that case it is certain that a life will be saved, whereas in the present case it is uncertain that the doctors will cure someone next time due to this autopsy, the response is that there, too, it is uncertain that the victim will be found to have been terminally ill. Moreover, even if it uncertain that a life will be saved, all of the prohibitions of the Torah are superseded, except for three. Your excellency wrote about this at length. Regarding this, I say that the Talmud’s statements are puzzling. How could it say that we desecrate [the victim’s corpse] in order to save a life? On the contrary. The desecration serves to kill the murderer, for if we do not desecrate, the murderer will be saved, because we will say that he killed someone with a terminal illness. Rather, this is the interpretation of these words. If you suggest that the Torah does not permit desecration, perforce it commands us to put [a murderer] to death without examining and without any concern that the murder victim has a terminal illness, it would make more sense to say that the Torah commands “the congregation shall save”—namely, that we must be concerned lest he killed someone with a terminal illness, and therefore [the murderer] should not be put to death without an examination. And let there be desecration, for if the Torah permitted desecration, there is no reason to be concerned about desecration. Moreover, if we say that the murderer can never be put to death unless the victim is examined, this desecration is for the honor of the victim, and anything for his honor does not constitute desecration.",
                "I have written all of this in accordance with your words, for you call this saving lives. But I am puzzled. If this is considered even a questionable case of saving lives, why must you engage in all of these mental gymnastics? It is clear and explicit that even an uncertainty supersedes the severity of Shabbat, and there is an explicit mishna on Yoma 83 that the possibility of saving a life supersedes Shabbat. And there on 84b it states that not only an uncertainty concerning the present Shabbat, but even an uncertainty concerning a different Shabbat [supersedes]. However, this all applies when there is a present case of uncertainty concerning a risk to life—such as a sick person or collapsed building. Similarly, in the case in Hullin regarding a murderer, the risk to life is present. So too in the monetary case in Bava Batra, the potential damage is present. But in our case, there is no ill person who needs this. Rather, they want to study this discipline in case they encounter a sick person who requires it. We certainly do not supersede any Torah prohibition or even a rabbinic prohibition due to such a slight concern. For if you call this concern “an uncertainty pertaining to a life,” then any task related to healing—grinding and cooking medicine or preparing a scalpel for bloodletting—will be permitted on Shabbat, perhaps they will encounter a sick person who requires it that night or the next day. It is also difficult to distinguish between concern for the need arising in the near future and concern for the need arising in the distant future. Heaven forfend that such a thing should be permitted. Even gentile physicians do not gain surgical experience with just any corpse, but only with those put to death by the law or with those who themselves consented to it while living. If we, God forbid, are lax in this matter, they will operate on every corpse to learn anatomy and physiology, so that they may know how to cure the living. Therefore, this is all unnecessarily lengthy, and there is no lenient approach whatsoever. In my opinion, your Excellency was mistaken in rushing to respond leniently.",
