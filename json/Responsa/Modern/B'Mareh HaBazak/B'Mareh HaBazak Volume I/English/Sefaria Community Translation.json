            "And indeed, when this questions came up for public discussion in the State of Israel a number of years ago, it was decided to make days of remembrance in the style of Yom HaShoah and Yom HaZikaron (the memorial day for fallen soldiers of the IDF) without fasting. And they even attached the day of the general Kaddish (for those who died in the Holocaust without a known day of death) to the Tenth of Tevet, which is a fixed fast day. Likewise should we remember and cry over that which has happened to our people from the day that they left the land of their father on the days and fasts that were already delineated as days of 'crying for the generations.'"
