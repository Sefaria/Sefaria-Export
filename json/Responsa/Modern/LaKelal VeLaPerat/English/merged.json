                    "And I very much would like that my daughter go up to the Torah, recite the blessing and read the haftarah. I approached the stewards of the synagogue in which I pray in the mentioned location and they are understandably hesitant about the matter. Hence I found the courage to turn to your honor about this question as I am doing now.",

                    "It is good and proper to have a celebration for a Bat Mitzvah in the same way that is done for a Bar Mitzvah - to invite family, friends and acquaintances and have them participate in the celebration. At this occasion, the Bat Mitzvah girl should recite the Shehechiyanu blessing over a new garment and - if she is learned - she should say words relating to the day, read the Song of Devorah and the first two verses of Channah's prayer.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ben Ish Chai, Year 1, Parashat Reeh 17; Shut Yaskil Avdi vol. 8, Orach Chaim 17; Netivei Am 225 at the end; Shut Iggerot Moshe, vol. 1, Orach Chaim 104; Shut Yabeah Omer vol. 6, Orach Chaim 29:4. The Song of Devorah is Judges 5, [the mentioned verses of] Channah's prayer are I Samuel 2:1-2.</i> And the father of the girl should recite the blessing of exemption from the punishment of this one (exempting a parent from responsibility when their child becomes an adult).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Rama, Orach Chaim 225:72; Kaf HaChaim, Orach Chaim 225:15-16.</i> And they should bless her and say to her, \"Our sister, may you become thousands of myriads.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 24:60.</i> And she should, of course, go beforehand to the synagogue to pray, but not to go up to the Torah.",
                    "It is an explicit halakha that a woman does not read from the Torah in public<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Mishneh Torah, Laws of Prayer 12:17; Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chaim 282:3; Shut Taalumot Lev vol. 3:20; and see responsum 5 here (in this book).</i>; and we do not change laws based on the feelings of people. It would be good to pray to God that your daughters merit to marry men who are observant of the Torah and the commandments, and your sons-in-law are like your sons.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Bereishit Rabbah 84:19 - a man does not prevent himself from calling his son-in-law, his son; and his daughter-in-law, his daughter. And likewise did Rashi write (Shabbat 23b, s.v. nafak minayhu) that one's son-in-law is like his son.</i> So their children will go up to the Torah and you will rejoice in them and in their joy from amongst contentment and great satisfaction.",
