            "Regarding your question about someone who constantly takes oaths and is accustomed to swearing for everything, and a legal case arises where an oath is administered to him in court, and he violates the oath, thus exempting him from the consequences of the oath - once he has transgressed the oath, he becomes distant from the obligation of oath-taking and says, \"I will not swear at all.\" However, now he is fearful of the oath. What is the ruling in such a case? Since he was accustomed to taking oaths before this incident, and when obligated by the court, he says, \"I will not swear,\" they administer the oath to him."
