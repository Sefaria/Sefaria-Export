            "A, who had for a number of years been using a seat in the synagogue bequeathed by his father to him and to his brothers, acknowledged on his deathbed that his brothers had not given him their share of the seat in perpetuity. A had no children by his wife and had divorced her before he died in order to free her from the obligation of marrying one of his brothers. The woman, however, claimed that the whole seat belonged to her deceased husband, since he had held it during a period of three years, which legally gave him title to it; moreover, he had offered it once as a pledge for a charitable contribution. Hence she was entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i> from the value of the whole seat.",
            "The brothers, on the other hand, claimed that two-thirds of the seat belonged to them, but because they lived in another town they had allowed their brother, for the time being, the use of the whole seat. Selling it to somebody else would, in their opinion, have been a disgrace to their deceased father; and their brother's offer of the seat as a pledge for charity was done with their permission. ",
            "<b><i>Q</i>.  Has the divorced wife the right to collect her ketubah by claim of undisturbed possession, from the value of the whole seat in the synagogue?</b>",
            "<i>A</i>. The assertion of the brothers that they would not sell the seat in the synagogue out of respect for their deceased father, and that their brother had been using the seat in their absence with their permission, is readily believable. Moreover, A on his deathbed acknowledged the brother's ownership of the seat, and the confession of a dying person must be respected. Therefore, the woman's claim of undisturbed possession, being unsupported by any legal title, is not valid and she cannot collect her ketubah from the whole seat; but she can collect from the part which belonged to her husband, minus the amount which he pledged for charity."

The sale was then executed by the payment of the agreed sum in the presence of two witnesses, whereupon A repeated his stipulation. The deed of conveyance, however, which A afterwards delivered to B, was drawn without the reddendum, and in the presence of two other witnesses.",
            "An unavoidable accident occurred forcing A to remain in town, whereupon he sought to annul the sale, on the ground that he had sold the house with reservations.",
            "B acknowledged A's statement that the original sale had been made subject to the condition of A's moving from the town. But, B maintained, the deed of conveyance which A wrote afterwards before other witnesses, constituted a new, independent sale in which he apparently waived the right of his first reservation. Moreover, even if he wrote the deed with his mind on the stipulation first made, the deal could not be affected thereby, because he had failed to tell of it to his new witnesses, who did not know the condition he had orally made before the first witnesses.",
            "A maintained that he had never waived his reservation, and that the deed had been written with the intention stipulated orally. Moreover, a contract without a consideration is void, hence the deed of conveyance did not constitute the sale of the house; the payment of money, on the other hand, does constitute a deal, therefore the sale of the house was consummated upon the payment of the money and subject to the condition made at the time.<br><b><i>Q</i>. Can a contract without payment consummate a deal?</b>",
            "<i>A</i>. One can convey to another any object by a mere deed, in consideration of love and affection or good will, without receiving any other compensation therefore. But in a deal where consideration is the determining factor, as in the case of A and B, the consideration paid concludes the deal and the document only is to serve as evidence.",
            "Therefore, if the deed has the phrase: \"I sold you the house for the sum of_______\", the deed must be taken as a document of evidence and the house belongs to A; but if the deed has the phrase: \"Hereby I am selling you the house for the sum of________\", then B would be justified in his claim, because it constituted a new deal, as it was written before new witnesses, and A failed to declare his stipulation to them."

In consideration thereof, Jonah agreed to pay fifty <i>shok,</i> and produce sureties within thirty days to guarantee timely payment of the taxes to be collected by him. Accordingly, Jonah sent an agent with fifty shok, but Zeligman now sought to withdraw from the agreement. He disregarded the decision of the Jewish court and refused to accept the money.",

Kinyan is necessary to bind the decision of a court of arbiters only in cases of compulsory arbitration when the parties are forced to an agreement through an outside agency, or when arbitration is offered by the judges of the court instead of a <i>Din Torah</i>.

            "In the city of Padua, Italy, the ritual bath house of the Jewish community was placed in the yard of the synagogue, and the women going there before dark were exposed to the view and comments of the loiterers. For it was not customary for women to go to the synagogue for evening prayers. The more discreet women would postpone their obligatory immersions until Saturday night. Judah, and then his son Abraham Minz, ordered that the women go to cleanse and wash their hair preparatory to immersion by night rather than at twilight. This was based on a precedent. In the early part of the thirteenth century Eleazar ben Judah of Worms established a custom that, for the sake of chastity, women should conceal their immersion from their neighbors. Meir of Padua and his son Judah, as each held the rabbinic post in Padua, upheld this reform by declaring it permissible for the women to take the ritual bath at night. ",

The custom of going to the bath house by day rather than at night was instituted by, the women themselves, in order that they be able to do their cleansing and the washing of their hair more properly (the bath houses were poorly illuminated at night). But now, since it is detrimental for them to go there by day, the custom of going at night is preferable.",

            "The testimony of all the witnesses exhibited by the defense is no ground to disqualify A and B as witnesses, because they were not present when the evidence against them was given. <br>If reliable witnesses would have testified before a competent court in the presence of his wife to the same charges as those of A and B, Zeligman would have been justified in divorcing her. Although the evidence speaks of indecency and not of infidelity, and although the evidence is divided, the court would have recognized the charges as sufficient ground for a divorce even without the payment of the ketubah. The objection raised by Zeligman in his rebuttal against the testimony of the defense would then be sustained by this court. Under the circumstances, however, it is obligatory to reject Zeligman's plea for the following reasons.",
            "First, if Zeligman were right in his rebuttal that the testimony against A and B ought to be annulled because it was given in their absence, then their own testimony ought to be annulled, because it was given in the absence of his wife. His declaration that no witness would have testified against her in her presence, and that no court would have convicted her under the same conditions because her father dominated the city, is known to be untrue. His own faction controlled the city of Prague at the time of the trial. Besides, he refused to appear before the court of Rabbis Sterenberg, Stengly, and Bern, who are known to be competent rabbis and who would try the case without fear or favor. Moreover, even if it were true that the city of Prague was intimidated by her father, she could not lose her right to defend herself before the law on that account.",
            "Second, in cases of matrimonial relations, where the chastity of the woman is involved, her right to live with her husband, the right of her husband to divorce her, and her right to remarry another man, the witnesses must be treated with all the rigor and scrutiny of those in capital cases. Therefore, a) since two competent witnesses testified that A and B were informers, and many more witnesses established the fact that they were known publicly as suspects and worthless individuals, which disqualifies them to act in capital cases as witnesses, they could not for the same reason act as witnesses against Miriam. Although they were not legally disqualified, and their evidence might still be taken in civil cases, their testimony against Miriam is void. b) Since they failed to indicate in their testimony the time of the alleged clandestine meeting of Miriam and X, their testimony is void. c) Since the testimony of A and that of B indicate two different acts, each attested by one witness, their evidence is split. And as it is unlawful to convict a person in a capital case on split evidence, so Miriam cannot be similarly convicted. d) Since the similarity of the wording of their testimony raises suspicion as to its validity, they should have been cross-examined: and the court having failed to do so, their evidence is void. e) Since the judges of the court (if any court was held) before whom this evidence was given are unreliable, as they did not cross-examine the witnesses, and as their signatures are illegible (they cannot be allowed to validate them now) and nobody knows who they are, the evidence is void.",
            "Third, a court is permitted to execute punishment on the basis of actual facts, though not ascertained by legal evidence. This court, therefore, is now taking the right, on the basis of all the evidence given here, to disqualify the witnesses A and B, although they are not present. And they shall from now on not be permitted to testify even in the presence of the accused, a) because they are publicly known as suspicious characters; b) because they did not honor the summons of the court even under the penalty of the herem.",
            "The court rejects the rest of the testimony produced by Zeligman:",
            "Exhibit No. I by Solomon ben Eliezer Zelkind does not imply any privacy between Miriam and X; it does not even prove indecency. a) Because he stated that he saw them in a public place.",
            "Exhibit No. II by Solomon ben Eliezer Zelkind evinces no clandestine misconduct, either. a) Because another man might have been with them in the room. b) No woman can be charged of having been closeted with a man during the time her husband is in town. c) Meeting a woman in privacy in the company of a man would not prohibit her from living with her husband, for if such were the rule no woman would be able to live with her husband.",
            "Exhibit No. III by Solomon ben Eliezer Zelkind charges Miriam with indecency, but the charge is no ground for divorce. a) He did not testify in person, and written evidence is not accepted in capital cases. b) He acknowledged, before his testimony reached the court, that he wrote the testimony under duress in order to get back his pledges, which acknowledgment annulled his testimony.",
            "Exhibit No. IV by the woman is no ground for divorce. a) Because another man might have been with them in the house that night.",
            "Exhibit No. V by the little boy is of no significance at all. a) Because children are ruled to be unreliable in capital cases.",
            "The persistent rumor about Miriam's misconduct would not prohibit Zeligman from living with her again. It is obvious that the rumor was spread by Zeligman himself, by his relatives, by the false witnesses that he solicited, and by Mordecai's enemies. His assertion that he believes in the witnesses and in the rumors, and that this, according to the law, prohibits him from living with his wife, again does not tally with the facts on hand. a) Were the witnesses of honest and reliable character, upon whose integrity Zeligman would rely in other affairs, his assertion that he believes them with regard to his wife would have to be sustained. But as a matter of fact Zeligman would not believe these suspects in anything else, therefore he cannot say that he believes their evidence against his wife. b) According to his own testimony he noticed nothing about his wife to warrant an accusation of infidelity. c) Two years ago he wanted to return to her and live with her again. d) Moreover, since that belief, according to his own statement, was based on the testimony of witnesses whose words the court has already annulled, he cannot any longer maintain that he is not permitted to live with his wife again.",
            "Zeligman has the right to live with his wife again and cannot divorce her against her free will. He could even be forced to live with her if she wished. <br>However, since this opinion has no precedent in the law, no reunion shall take place unless approved by two scholars of two different cities, each of whom heads a rabbinical school there. If neither of the litigants attempts to obtain such approval within three months, Zeligman would then have the right to divorce his wife upon the payment of her ketubah and other money promised in her dowry. The bill of divorce, no matter how delivered, would then be no forced divorce.",
            "Zeligman's statement that he has other witnesses to testify against his wife, but he does not know their whereabouts, holds the attention of the bet-din. The decision of the rabbis of Prague that any witness refusing to appear before this bet-din during this trial should not again be eligible to testify in the case, does not meet with the approval of the bet-din. If Zeligman has competent and reliable witnesses he may file a new charge at any time in the future against his wife. <br>But while the case, under present conditions, has been adjudged in favor of his wife, no single witness should appear before a bet-din to testify against her even in her presence; no witnesses should give evidence in her absence; and nobody should carry defamatory reports about her. Such acts will be regarded as slander and will be punished accordingly. If Zeligman himself will continue to disgrace her and injure her repuation he will be guilty of defaming and dishonoring the name of his own wife and will also be punished accordingly. <br>The \"judges\" who admitted the testimony in the absence of Miriam and then tried her in her absence deserve a severer punishment than merely invalidating their signatures. In other words, they ought to be treated more harshly than mere expulsion from the legal profession. But since they are not here and the bet-din cannot try them in their absence, therefore let their conscience be their own judge, and let their degradation be their recompense.The case was then referred to Luria. At the first instance he refused to review it, because he believed the Isserles court competent enough to decide it alone. But, being moved by the tears of Mordecai Katz and urged by the leaders of Lublin, he examined the case and made the following decision.",
            "I. The main evidence speaks of indecency and not of infidelity. No testimony was given that they were found nude together, hence there is no charge of adultery, according to Rashi. Rashi and Rabbenu Gershon, Rif, Rambam, Rabbenu Hananeel, and Rabbenu Tam hold that only infidelity is ground for divorce. Even according to Sheiltot, Rosh, and Rabbenu Meir, who hold that evidence of indecency in addition to a persistent evil rumor is ground for divorce, Zeligman has no claim to divorce his wife. The rumor must come from a different source and tell of different facts from those of the evidence. And this rumor was spread by the witnesses who testified to the indecency. The testimony of the woman, of the child, and of Zelkind has no significance whatsoever. Even Zelkind's exhibit III is no ground for divorce. It does not speak of a clandestine meeting at all, because there are always pedestrians in the streets of Prague, the guards are going their rounds, and the students who go home at night watch the houses and knock at the open doors.",
            "II. The evidence was given in the absence of the accused, and therefore it is invalid under any circumstances. Zeligman's plea, even if it were true, that he was forced to give the evidence in the absence of his wife, because his father-in-law controlled the city and undue influence would have been exerted upon the court, cannot be sustained. Moreover, it is true that Mordecai Katz predominated over the city at one time in the past, but not at the time of the trial. When the trial took place Zeligman's faction was administering the affairs of the community, and Mordecai was humble and submissive. One of Zeligman's witnesses even inflicted a number of blows on Mordecai in the presence of the leaders of the city; and when he was arrested, he was kept under guard for a period of four weeks without being convicted. Furthermore, Miriam could not have been denied the right to defend herself on account of her father. Zeligman's argument that the evidence affects him as much as his wife, for it prohibits him from living with her just as it prohibits her from living with him, and that since he was present at the trial the evidence should be ruled valid although she was absent, is based on no foundation. The court is not concerned in saving him for his wife or vice versa. The court is only anxious to save the good name of his wife, while his name, on the other hand, was not stigmatized by the evidence. Again, the congregation of Prague has a special ordinance not to give any testimony except in the presence of the leaders of the city, the two sextons, and the public scribe. The evidence, having been presented in violation of this ordinance, is void.",
            "III. Testimony must be given before three men who are experts in the laws of evidence. The bet-din before whom the evidence was given was not well versed in the laws of evidence. It failed to cross-examine the witnesses, as legally required. And according to the rulings of Rabbenu Tam and Rashba no sanction for a divorce can be granted without first cross-examining the witnesses. Hence Zeligman has no right to divorce his wife.",
            "IV. The lack of moral integrity of the witnesses disqualifies them from testifying in any case. They were not qualified to testify in this case, in particular, because they were proven to be Mordecai's life enemies. It was further proven that Zeligman and his relatives were soliciting false witnesses. The evidence was delivered in writing, which is accepted rabbinically in money matters only, but not in ritual cases, and especially in this case, which must be treated with the same strictness as capital cases.",
            "V. In general, Zeligman conducted the entire case in a fraudulent manner. His assertion that he is not allowed to live with his wife because he believes his witnesses, is not true. He acknowledged that he himself did not see anything indecent about her, and certainly he would not believe the false witnesses whom he himself hired. Since men cannot divorce their wives nowadays against their free will, nor have they the right to marry more than one wife because of the herem of Rabbenu Gershon, therefore they who are in love with other women turn to such deceptive practices as Zeligman did to rid themselves of their wives.",

Is such a practice to be followed by the heads of the congregations?</b>",
            "<i>A</i>. Although one must not argue against a lion (scholar) after he is dead, yet I must answer the question for the sake of the law. The head of the congregation should wash his hands first and wait (although the waiting is not pleasant nor respectful) for all the other guests to wash their hands. During this time he should not engage in any needless talk, but he should answer questions on erudition. This would not constitute an interruption. On the contrary, conversations concerning the Law are required at meal time. Such behavior on the part of the ecclesiastical head would set the right kind of example for all the others to follow. For if the people washed their hands first they would engage in vanities."

            "In 1547 A brought suit against B before a certain rabbi. Both A and B refused to submit their case to arbitration and asked the rabbi to decide it for them in accordance with the strict law, whereupon they signed an agreement to abide by his decision. However, B demanded that the rabbi should add two associates to try the case. The rabbi neither rejected his claim nor sustained it, but upon A's insistence he tried it alone. Thus deponed A: I held a monopoly for the sale of whiskey for a district in the neighborhood of Brest-Litovsk for a period of three years. Before the time expired, B made an attempt to obtain a franchise from the city authorities for the same monopoly. However, I succeeded in persuading the mayor and other city officials to renew my license for three more years. With the new license in my possession I warned B at the synagogue in the presence of the congregation no longer to encroach upon my rights. B, however, now convinced that he would no longer be able to do me harm through the mayor and the other city authorities, turned to the queen's secretary. The queen<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bona (Sforza)</i> then ordered the mayor and the other commissioners to revoke my license and transfer it to B for the enormous price of 80 <i>shok</i>. The commissioners executed her order and my livelihood was ruined. I now demand satisfaction as the law may justify.",
            "B, answering the charge, said: I had never even thought of competing with a Jew. But competition in this country is a national evil. Many great monopolists have practiced it. My partner and I were once outbid of the same franchise. The same is true about the farming of taxes; one buys the privilege for a certain period of time either at auction, or purchases it through the mayor if the latter is well bribed. Then, usually, another bidder comes along, offers a higher price, and forces the first one out. Furthermore, in this case, I did not resort to this common practice. The commissioners and the judge sent for me and my partner and offered us a monopoly for the sale of whiskey for another locality. During this transaction they promised us on their own accord to sell us the monopoly held by A. We have a competent witness who heard the judge make that offer of sale to us. A, in the meantime, had been trying to purchase it from the mayor through one of the officials; he offered a higher price and promised a bribe for the mayor. But the official informed him that the mayor had no right to sell without the consent of the other authorities. When the rest of the officials learned of A's intentions they sent for us again, and offered us the contract for three years as promised by the judge. We affirmed their offer; they affixed the seal of the city to the contract and gave it to us. <br>Before we left, one of the officials asked for the contract on the pretext that it had to be re-examined, but they then refused to return it unless we paid a bribe of 400 <i>Rhine-landish</i> to the judge and the same amount to each of the other officials, as such, they said, had always been their practice. One of the officials put the contract away in his private desk and said to us: \"The contract is now in hands more trustworthy than yours; nobody could purchase it now even if he raised the price, and you will get your contract as soon as you pay what is coming to us.\"<br> After we had settled with them, A and his partners approached the mayor with a more alluring bribe and raised the bid for the license still higher. The mayor then commanded the commissioners not to return us the contract at all, because, he admitted, A and his partners had offered a higher price. <br>We then warned A and his partners in public not to compete with us, and if they sustained any damage we would settle it before a Jewish court. We have witnesses to testify to this. But they ignored our warning and succeeded with the mayor and with the officials in annulling our contract.",
            "We then proposed to A and his partners that we hold the monopoly in equal partnership, but they refused. (Obadiah and Meir ha-Levi testified to that statement.)  We also warned the mayor in the presence of the officials, who had worked with him to annul our contract, that we would lodge a complaint with the queen over the annulment of a legal government contract. The mayor affirmed our claim, but, he said, he could not alter his course, because the other Jews had offered a higher price. <br>The bribe that we paid to the judge and the others had not been returned to us, although we made demands for it on numerous occasions. Meanwhile the queen's secretary came to the city on his periodic visit, to listen to complaints against the mayor and other officials. Among many other complainants, we related to him all that had transpired with regard to the monopoly. Towards the end of our complaint, in order to save the money we had paid out in bribes, we told the secretary that we too could afford to pay as high a price as 80 <i>shok,</i> provided we were not called upon to pay such heavy personal bribes. ",
            "The secretary rebuked the mayor and his officials for revoking a government contract. Some tried to excuse themselves by saying that the object of the mayor in annulling the contract was to raise more money for the government. But a quarrel soon broke out among the officials in the presence of the secretary and he learned that the monopoly sold to A had not been offered at auction but sold privately, and that the government seal had been stolen by the officials from the City Hall for that purpose; hence A's contract was a forgery. <br>The secretary reported the entire case, and the queen decided that the bribes forced from us be returned, and a new contract be given in her name for the price we had offered the judge, plus the bribes we had paid him and the officials.",
            "When A learned of the queen's order he summoned me before the rabbi mentioned and proclaimed, first, that I had no right to compete with him because he had had the concession for three years; second, that the deal I had made with the judge and the other officials had never been executed, inasmuch as they retained the contract. Therefore, his deal with the mayor, which took place afterwards, was legal and I had no right to influence the government to revoke it.",

            "B then asked Luria for his opinion: <br><b><i>Q</i>. 1. Is the rabbi's judgment in accordance with the law? 2. If not, is it binding, since both of us signed an agreement to abide by his judgment?</b>",
            "<i>A</i>. The findings upon question of law arising in this case have not been submitted to me and I do not know on what ground the rabbi awarded his judgment in favor of A. A told me that the rabbi supported his judgment on a responsum of Rokeah (Eleazer ben Judah of Worms) which reads: \"Be careful not to encroach upon your neighbor's rights. You shall not take his livelihood from him. Wicked is the man who raises the price for a deal made with the government; such an act is not forgivable. No other robber can be considered as bad as he. If he will not submit to the law let him be put under a ban.\" If this responsum were the only support upon which the rabbi based his judgment, I would reverse it without hesitation, as I shall explain below. But I cannot rely upon A that this was the reason for the rabbi's decision, because A is not versed in the law. I shall, therefore, analyze the case from all angles before I award the decision."

            "1. As to the law: <br>The laws governing competition, the laws regulating the dealings of Jews with gentiles, and the purchase and sale laws could not have prohibited B from purchasing the monopoly. <br>a) The law prohibiting competition was derived from the passage, <i>Ani ha-mehapek ba-hararah u-ba aher u-netalah hemenu nikra rasha</i><sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">T. B. Kiddushin, 59a.</i>—\"If a poor man moves about a stack (waiting for its removal to take up a forgotten sheaf) and another man comes along and takes it from him, the latter is called a wicked man.\"",
            "Rashi interpreted the passage verbatim, and ruled that the law of competition is applicable even to abandoned property, to something found, and to charity. ",
            "Rabbenu Tam, however, held that the law against competition does not govern these instances; as no law prohibits one from obtaining a thing which is free for all through unrestricted rivalry. This applies to a thing or service which cannot be replaced. The passage referred to is metaphoric and speaks of the following ways of competition: For example, if one were trying to hire himself out to work and another preceded him and obtained the job, or if one were trying to purchase a certain article and another stepped forward and bought it for himself, the latter is merely called a wicked man without further punishment, because work and merchandise can be obtained elsewhere. <br>The ruling of Rabbenu Tam was accepted by most of the halakists, including Ri (Isaac ben Samuel ha-Zaken of Dempierre), Rabenu Meir (Meir ben Baruk of Rothenburg), and Rosh. It was not changed thereafter. Thus, competition as described by Rabbenu Tam is regarded in the eyes of the law as wicked, but no damages may be assessed therefor. <br>Even when a person tries to obtain something by actual work and has suffered a loss because of competition, his competitor is not liable for damages. For instance, the poor man who does the gleaning on top of an olive tree is entitled by law to the olives which fall down under him. His competitor who picks them up is considered a robber in a rabbinical sense. Yet the law cannot force him to return them. <br>When, however, a newcomer interferes with a native in the practice of his profession to the extent of depriving him of his livelihood, damages are collectible by law.",
            "b) The rules which regulate trading between Jews and gentiles were derived from the passage: <i>Nikse obed kokabim hare hen ke-midbar we-kol ha-mahazik ba-hen zakah</i><sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">T. B. Baba Batra, 54b.</i>—\"Pagan property is on a par with deserted property, and anyone who reaches for it acquires it.\" <br>This abstruse passage was thus elucidated by Rashbam (Samuel ben Meir) : When a pagan has sold his property to a Jew and received the purchase price therefor, but no deed of conveyance has been delivered to the Jew, the latter has no foundation for ownership. Then if another Jew acquires the same property of the pagan by proper deed, he has gained possession thereof. The rule remains that no Jew can get possession of property upon simple payment of money without a deed of conveyance, when it is purchased of a pagan. The second purchaser, however, is a wicked man, Rashbam continued, and he should be proclaimed as such by the sexton in the synagogue. <br>Rambam amended the law and ruled that the second purchaser should pay the first, as penalty, the amount he paid to the pagan. But this, Rambam proceeded, is applicable only in countries where they have no real estate laws; in countries where real estate is regulated by law, the Jews submit to the same regulations as the gentiles.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishneh Torah, Hilkot Zekiah u-Matanah, 1:14-15.</i> <br>In all civil cases the Jewish court accepts the laws of the respective countries. Rokeah in his responsum speaks of a case where the deal was consummated and the second Jew succeeded in persuading the government to revoke it; therefore he ruled that the competitor was liable to damages.",
            "c) The laws of purchase and sale are diversified according to localities. In some places coaxing customers is held to be unfair competition and liable to damages, while in others it is permitted. In the district of Brest-Litovsk enticing customers, according to a decision of Rabbi Kalonymus, was not regarded as unfair competition.",
            "Hence the decision of the rabbi is void.",
            "a) The laws governing competition could not have prohibited B from purchasing the monopoly were it even on a par with a profession, because B was a native, and had been engaged in the same business before. Furthermore, a monopolist does not have the status of a professional. A monopoly cannot be considered an established trade, because it is offered for sale every three years at public auction. It is rather like a found article, where no laws of encroachment prevail at all, according to Rabbenu Tam's accepted ruling. Even if the rabbi agreed with Rashi in his opinion concerning the laws of competition he could not have decided in favor of A on this ground, because A had never obtained a legal contract of the deal. The contract given him by the city officials was a forgery and had been annulled by the queen.",
            "b) A could not have argued that since the city had sold him the monopoly three years ago by legal contract, and since this was gentile property, he had the right to keep it in perpetuity, and no other Jew had the right to compete with him. For the city had sold it to him for three years only as required by law, and expected it back at the expiration of the term. ",
            "c) According to the laws of purchase and sale no intrusion was unlawful in the district of Brest-Litovsk. Moreover, the city officials had sent for B and offered to lease the monopoly to him, because they would not again lease it to A. Hence, B might not even be called wicked for acquiring the monopoly. The rabbi, therefore, had no ground for deciding the case in favor of A. Even more remote from the law was the rabbi's decision that B had to pay A the increase in the price of the monopoly, whereas B had not raised the price at all. At any rate, this would be indirect damages, for which B could not be held responsible. <br>B, then, had the right of purchasing the monopoly, because it usually changed hands every three years. The contract the city made with B was valid, although it was drawn before A's term expired, because there was no subject involved in the deal which had to be delivered from one hand to the other. The city sold him a license, a permit, a right to manufacture whiskey, after the contract of the old concessionaire should have expired. This the government was accustomed to do prior to the expiration of the old contract. <br>The fact that the city officials did not return the contract to B did not annul the deal, because witnesses and rumors had confirmed that the deal was consummated. Moreover, the queen, whose authority over her subjects permits her to approve and to annul their acts because they are her slaves, made a new contract with B. B could not be treated as an informer because he told the queen's secretary of the bribes; his object in doing so was to save his money and not to inform the government concerning A.",
            "2. As to the agreement: <br>a) The rabbi violated the rule, \"Do not hold court as a single judge.\" Even an experienced judge, chosen willingly by the litigants, whether to award a decision according to the law, or to act as an arbiter, is not allowed to judge alone in monetary cases. <br>b) A and B came to the rabbi to decide their dispute in accordance with the law. Moreover, one of the litigants (B) asked for two associates, which indicated that he had made the agreement with the implicit understanding that the rabbi would conduct the case according to the law; but the latter judged it alone, therefore the agreement was void. <br>c) If a court has decided a case contrary to the law, its decision is void. It is needless to say that a decision contrary to talmudic law is void, for even one opposed to the laws of the geonim or the halakists, if not supported by the law of the Talmud, is also void, to the same degree as if one had decided against an explicit law of the Mishnah. An agreement by litigants to abide by such a decision is not binding. The decision of the rabbi that B had no right to purchase the monopoly, and that he must return it to A plus the additional expenses it would cost now to retain it, was inconsistent with the law.",
            "Therefore, the monopoly belongs to B, and he cannot even be accused of unfair competition. In the rabbinic sense A acted tortiously, and he would have to pay B all the damages the latter sustained on account of this strife, but I am not to render sentence as far as this is concerned."

Moreover, this contract could not be used as evidence even if it were written in a Jewish court. The contract does not indicate any specific terms with regard to their partnership. It reads that A and B sold 10,000 boards to the gentile merchants. The logical conclusion of this statement is that they are equal partners, and the money received for the 10,000 boards will be equally divided between them. However, according to their oral testimony, the 3,400 boards belonged to A alone, and B would have no share in the money when they were paid for. Why, then, did not A protect himself against B, that the latter should not be able to claim a part of this money on the strength of the contract? Because he had faith that B would not claim any money for the 3,400 boards; he had more faith in B than in the contract. This fact vitiated the contract and it cannot be accepted as evidence in the court. Therefore, the court upon his oath must decide in favor of B that his agreement with A applied only to the 6,600 boards."

However, I made no protest against the action of the rabbis because, at the time, I could not refute their interpretation of Rabbenu Gershon's decree.

            "Question: If one has a headache (lit. “his head is heavy”), may he sit and eat with his head uncovered?",
            "Response: I know of no prohibition against reciting a blessing without [wearing] a head covering. Yet it was obvious to Maharai (=R. Yisrael Isserlein) that it is forbidden to invoke God’s name without the head covered, and I do not know whence [he infers that]. Now I have found that it is written in tractate Soferim (14:15) that there is a dispute: “A shabby person whose knees are visible or whose clothing is torn, or one whose head is uncovered, may lead the prayers (“pores et ha-Shema”), but some say that one may lead with knees [showing] or torn clothes, but not with an uncovered head. And he may not let mention [of God’s name] leave his mouth.” R. Yeruham wrote at the end of §16 that it is forbidden to recite a blessing with an uncovered head. ",
            "If not for the fact that I do not usually dispute earlier authorities unless there is a great authority to support me, I would incline toward leniency and in favor of reciting blessings with an uncovered head. Even the recitation of Shema is permitted, for it states in Midrash Rabba (Vayikra §27): R. Berekhya said: A flesh-and-blood king sends his charter to the province, what do they do? All residents of the province stand up, uncover their heads, and read it with fear, awe, trembling, and perspiration. But the Holy One, blessed be He, says to Israel: Recite the Shema, My charter. I do not trouble you to read it standing or with your heads uncovered. This clearly implies that it is not forbidden to uncover one’s head; rather, He did not impose [an uncovered head] as a stringency. But what can I do? They have already ruled this to be forbidden.",
            "Yet I am astonished that they treat uncovering the head as forbidden even when not praying. I do not know whence they derived this, for we find no prohibition against an uncovered head except in the case of a woman, as stated in the chapter “Ha-madir” (Ketubot 72b), and that it reflects piety (midat hasidut, i.e., not actually required by law) not to walk four cubits with an uncovered head. Yet this is specifically walking four cubits, as stated in the chapter “Kol Kitvei” (Shabbat 118b): “R. Hanina said: I deserve it, for I did not walk four cubits with an uncovered head.” This reflects piety, like all of the other examples of “I deserve” listed there. Further evidence is from the first chapter of Kiddushin (31a), which rules: R. Yehoshua b. Levi said: It is forbidden to walk four cubits with an upright posture, as it is stated: ‘The whole world is filled with His glory’ (Yeshayahu 6:3). R. Huna b. R. Yehoshua would not walk four cubits with his head uncovered. He would say: ‘The divine presence is above my head.’ This implies that specifically walking with an erect posture is forbidden, but it is not forbidden to do so with one’s head uncovered. Rather, R. Huna was stringent with himself, motivated by piety. Nowadays, the opposite is the case: they are not careful about avoiding an erect posture. On the contrary, the proud and the rich walk around with their heads held high, but they are careful about uncovering their heads—not because of piety, but because they think this is the Jewish religion.",
            "I have also found written that this statement about an uncovered head only applies out under the open sky. This is a reasonable explanation of the case of the erect posture—even though the entire world is filled with His glory, nevertheless, one does not look as though he is ignoring his Maker except when he walks out under the open sky. It is there that one must remember and maintain vigilance. And even though R. Isserlein wrote that there is no distinction between home and courtyard, for the whole world is filled with His glory, this only applies to the case of invoking God’s name. Indeed, it stands to reason that refraining from invoking God’s name with an uncovered head reflects piety, much like the case of walking four cubits in the open air. I have also found this written in the name of R. Meir [of Rothenburg], namely, that this is all a matter of pious practice, although R. Peretz wrote that one should object to someone entering the synagogue with an uncovered head. Moreover, Tur does not state “and he shall cover his head” except with regard to prayer, not with regard to the recitation of the Shema. But what can I do? The people practice this as a prohibition, and I have no authority to be lenient in their presence.",
            "I have heard of a sage who would study Torah with his head uncovered, saying that the weight was too heavy for him. Nevertheless, it seems to me that although it is not forbidden, and it is not even an act of piety if one is not invoking God’s name, a Torah scholar should still be cautious, for the people perceive it as laxity and permissiveness, as though he transgressed the Jewish religion. Even if he is studying in his room, he should not rely on this, lest an ignoramus see him and make light of him. It is not for naught that they say that anything forbidden because of how it looks (mar’it ayin) is even forbidden in the innermost chambers. ",
            "Now I will disclose the shame of Ashkenazim. Certainly one who drinks libation wine (yeyn nesekh) in a gentile’s inn, and eats fish cooked in their vessels, and who is considered strict if he trusts the innkeeper’s wife when she says that she did not cook anything else in them, is not under any suspicion. We do not investigate him, and we treat him with respect if he is rich and powerful. But one who eats and drinks only kosher food, but he does so with his head uncovered, is perceived to be a deviant. Therefore, “the wise man has his eyes in his head” (Kohelet 2:14) and will know to protect himself so that they do not attack him. If placing something heavy on his head will weigh upon him, he should cover his head with a garment of fine linen or silk. ",
            "Still, it seems reasonable that even one who wishes to recite a blessing over consumption (Birkat ha-nehenin) at night, when he has no hat on, or while he is bathing, it is sufficient for him to cover his head with his hands, even though one major authority has recorded that this is forbidden, and R. Isserlein cites him. Their proof is that Rabbeinu Tam, when he was bathing in warm water and would drink, would cover himself with a garment over the place of his heart,  not with his hands. But this is no proof, for the reason this is not considered covering is that it is normal for someone to place his hands on his heart, and one who sees this will not know that one needs to cover his heart, or will imagine that he did not really cover the area over the heart. However, since it is discernable, it is sufficient to use the hand as a cover above his head, especially given what I have written, namely, that this is not a prohibition but merely a matter of piety. It is therefore sufficient to use the hand as a cover in an impromptu fashion.  "

Therefore, if the blind man lives with other people who light the Hanukkah candles, it is best that he participate with them in buying the candles, whereas they say the benediction. If he is married his wife should light the candles for him; and if he has no wife and lives by himself, he must light the candles with someone to help him.

While the former expresses the feeling of grief and distress, the latter expresses that of sheer mourning. The only reason why bathing is prohibited during the nine days is because the people of the diaspora thus obliged themselves; and the custom cannot be changed although not in accordance with the law. A nation or a majority of a nation may place upon itself restrictions which are not permitted by law. For instance, cohabitation of a mourner with his wife even on the Sabbath was prohibited by the people themselves. However, no individual has the right to make restrictions for himself. It is enough to obey the rules and regulations of the wise men.
