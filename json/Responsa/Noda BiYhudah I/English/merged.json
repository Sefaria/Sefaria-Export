                "I received your letter. Regarding your question as to whether a mourner may act as Shaliach ‎Tzibbur, passing before the Ark between the beginning of the month of Elul and Yom Kippur: You ‎ruled correctly that there is no prohibition in this, and one should not prevent a mourner from ‎leading the prayers, other than on Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur. On the other days, even on ‎days when Selichot are said and during the Ten Days of Repentance, there is no basis for protesting ‎against a mourner. Even on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur there is no element of prohibition, ‎only custom. Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur should be no stronger than Shabbat and Yom Tov, ‎which are actual days of joy and rest, and yet there is no prohibition [against having a mourner lead ‎the prayers], only custom, per Rama Yoreh Deah 376. Further, it is explained clearly in Maharil that ‎the custom applies only to Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur... We see that the entire custom is only ‎for Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur, which are occasions declared to be holy and which interrupt ‎mourning. Their added status does not relate at all to Elul or the Ten Days of Repentance.  ",
                "Those ‎who disagree say that this period [Elul and the Ten Days of Repentance] is one of judgment, but ‎just the opposite! For this reason one should even permit [a mourner to lead] even on Rosh ‎haShanah and Yom Kippur! Indeed, this was the exact question put to the Maharil, thinking that ‎because these are days of judgment, without any joy, Rosh haShanah and Yom Kippur should be ‎viewed as different from the other holidays [which are days of joy]. Further, even according to ‎their view, what would associate days of judgment and the month of Elul? Even the days of ‎Selichot before Rosh haShanah are not days of judgment –  just the opposite, they are days of ‎mercy and desire, the last set of forty days when Moshe Rabbeinu was on the mountain and the ‎Holy One showed him favour. It is only on Rosh HaShanah that the judgment begins... Moreover, ‎the Ten Days of Repentance are not called “days of  judgment”. Just the opposite, they are days of ‎mercy, during which Hashem avails Himself to every individual. Only Rosh HaShanah and Yom ‎Kippur are “days of judgment”...‎"

                "Regarding your fourth question, about the‏ ‏proper version of‏ ‏L’Shem Yichud, which has‎‏ ‏newly ‎spread and been printed in siddurim: I‏ ‏reply that before you ask me about the‏ ‏version, it would be ‎more appropriate to ask‏ ‏whether saying it is appropriate at all. In my opinion, it is an evil sickness ‎for our‏ ‏generation. Previous generations did not‏ ‏know of this prayer, and did not say it at all. These ‎people toiled their whole lives in Torah‏ ‏and in mitzvot, all according to the Torah‏ ‏and according to ‎the halachic authorities,‎‏ ‏whose words flow from the source of living‏ ‏waters, the vast sea of the ‎Talmud, regarding‏ ‏which it is said, “the integrity of the upright‏ ‏shall guide them.” They bore ‎excellent fruit‏ ‏and their kindness exceeded the heavens.‎ However, in our generation people have left G-d’s Torah and the source of living waters, the two ‎Talmuds, Bavli and Yerushalmi, to dig for themselves broken cisterns. Each one raises himself in the ‎arrogance of his own heart, saying, “I am the one who sees, the gates to heaven are open for me, ‎and for me the world exists.” These people are the destroyers of the generation. For this ‎orphaned generation I say that G-d’s paths are just, and the righteous walk in them, and the ‎Chasidim stumble in them [This is an alteration of Hoshea 14:14, in which the prophet says that ‎sinners will stumble in them.] I have much more to say on this matter, but just as it is a mitzvah to ‎say what will be heard, so too is it a mitzvah not to say something that will be ignored. (Yevamot ‎‎65b) G-d should have mercy upon us … ",
                "",
                "As far as his honour's suggestion that it would be good to ‎have a strong connection between our speech, thought, and action [via the L’Shem Yichud ‎recitation]: The Great Assembly established prayers and blessings for us, and there is nothing that ‎is not hinted to in the text of the prayers and blessings. A blessing awakens our speech and ‎thought, and each mitzvah that is preceded by a blessing does not need anything else before it, ‎just the blessing. If there is no blessing, my practice is to say, “Behold, I am doing this to fulfill the ‎will of my Master,” and this is enough, and nothing else is necessary. We are meant to focus only ‎on the meaning of the words; repair of celestial realms is accomplished inherently, through our ‎actions… I have already revealed my thinking on the matter, that silence would be better, and let ‎the matter sink into oblivion. In thought, too, one should think only about the meaning of the ‎words. One will walk securely on this path, and will not stumble in any way. There is no point in ‎elaborating more on this matter…‎"
